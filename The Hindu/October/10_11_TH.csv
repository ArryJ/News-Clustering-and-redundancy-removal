0,2020/10/11,Woman set on fire for dowry; police search for husband,"A 20-year-old newly married woman sustained severe burns after her husband allegedly set her on fire in her house at T.C. Palya in Ramamurthynagar on Friday. The victim, Chandini Devi, has been admitted to Victoria Hospital, where her condition is said to be critical, said the police.

“The victim told the police that she was being harassed by her husband, Suraj Singh, for dowry. He wanted her to bring money from her parents’ house,” said a police officer.

Chandni married Suraj, who runs a paan beeda shop in the city, a year ago. Ever since then, he has been harassing her and demanding dowry. After a fight on Friday Suraj allegedly poured petrol on her and set her on fire. The victim cried out for help alerting residents in the area, following which Suraj along with his mother fled the house.

Neighbours rushed the young woman to a hospital in the area from where she was shifted to Victoria Hospital for treatment. “We are on the lookout for Suraj and his mother,” the officer added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/woman-set-on-fire-for-dowry-police-search-for-husband/article32824472.ece
1,2020/10/11,Central Division police unearth stamp paper racket in Bengaluru,"The S.J. Park police have unearthed a fake stamp paper racket which was allegedly being run for several years at the City Civil Court complex on K.G. Road, close to the police headquarters. Four people have been arrested in connection with the racket — the main accused, Hussain Modi Babu, 53, and three typists and stamp paper vendors who worked at the court complex, Harish, 55, Shahwar, 42, and Najma, 35.

The police on Saturday announced that they arrested Babu a few days ago while he was handing over a bundle of fake stamp papers to Harish. Based on their confession, a police team raided the city court complex and arrested Shahwar and Najma. “The typists would buy fake stamp papers that Babu made at half the price and sell it to people at the court complex,” said a senior police officer.

Another team raided Babu’s house in Vivek Nagar, where they seized a computer, colour printers, and fake seals of the Shivajinagar and Bommanahalli sub-registrar offices. “We recovered a large stack of fake stamp papers of face value running into several lakhs of rupees,” the officer added. Babu allegedly confessed that he used plain A4-sized paper to print stamp paper and faked the franking and embossing process using a different software. The accused used to print stamp paper of different denominations depending on the demand.

Incidentally, Babu, who was called Chhota Telgi, had been arrested in 2013 for a similar offence, but managed to make bail. “Once on bail, he continued with the racket with the help of his associates who were working as typists and stamp vendors at the court complex,” N. Anucheth, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Central Division, said.

Babu is a high school dropout who worked as a tout assisting people in framing rental agreements and other official work. “As stamp papers are in great demand in the grey market, he decided to print and sell them. He teamed up with Harish, who worked as a typist at the court complex, offering to sell him stamp papers at half the price. Later, the two other accused, both college dropouts and working as typists and stamp paper vendors at the court complex, also joined Babu and bought stamp papers from him,” said another senior police officer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/central-division-police-unearth-stamp-paper-racket/article32824045.ece
2,2020/10/11,Rise in demonetised currency scams has Bengaluru police befuddled,"In the first week of October, the R.T. Nagar police arrested two people hailing from Odisha and recovered demonetised currency notes of ₹1 crore face value from them. The duo were trying to sell the currency notes for a few lakhs, promising prospective buyers that they would help them convert the notes into valid currency at a bank in Nepal. This is at least the fifth such case that has come to light this year, and the third since the lockdown was announced, said the police, who are befuddled by the rackets.

Some of those arrested also seem to falsely believe the exchange of old notes into legal currency is still happening in Nepal, said police officers. “We have checked with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Nowhere are these notes accepted for exchange any more” said Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant.

A probe is on to ascertain whether these notes are indeed being exchanged for legal tender in Nepal’s black market, where Indian currency is widely used, and the country is said to be stuck with a large cache of Indian demonetised currency. “But since India has stopped exchanging demonetised currency even from Nepal, it doesn’t make sense for them to buy more such notes” said a senior officer.

Two accused, Sheikh Toufil and Mudasir, who were arrested by the R.T. Nagar police recently claimed to have bought demonetised currency of ₹1 crore face value for ₹2.5 lakh from one Rehman, and were in turn trying to sell it for a higher return. “In most cases, those arrested are not the source of the currency, but carriers,” an officer said.

A senior police officer said the demonetised currency racket has become another baseless scam such as ‘rice pulling’ and ‘two-headed snakes’ that gullible people fall for. “It is ironic that many refuse to accept the ₹10 coin, a legal tender issued by the RBI, despite several circulars, but fall for the ruse of exchange of demonetised currency.”

Another officer said caches of demonetised currency, which were in black and could not be exchanged during the stipulated period in 2016, seem to have found their way into the market for this kind of duping. Lockdown and the economic stress may have pushed more people into such desperate schemes, the officer said.

Mr. Pant appealed to citizens not to fall for such scams. “Demonetised currency is not being exchanged into legal tender any more, anywhere in the world. So I request people to alert us of gangs trying to lure them with tall claims,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/rise-in-demonetised-currency-scams-has-bengaluru-police-befuddled/article32823987.ece
3,2020/10/11,Metro may offer 30% fare discount,"A proposal to be placed before a panel; move aimed at attracting more passengers

Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) is likely to offer 30% discount in fares, sources said. If implemented, the minimum fare will be reduced to ₹7 as against ₹10 and the maximum ₹42 as against ₹60.

The rate of discount was arrived at after a plan was chalked out recently to see which pricing would help commuters. But it is not clear how long the discount would be offered. “This plan will be presented to a committee and the possible implications arising out of this decision, both positive and negative, will be explained. Once the panel approves it, the plan will be implemented at the earliest,” another source said. But in the past, the committee has not rejected such proposals.

The primary reason for considering the discount was to draw more commuters. From 1.20 lakh a day in February this year, the number of commuters plummeted to 25,000 a day after the lockdown was lifted.

“The idea is to bring the ridership close to pre-COVID-19 levels. When you give discount and get people accustomed to travelling in this system, many may like the comfort and continue to stick to it even after it is withdrawn. But to achieve this, it may take time,” an official said.

CMRL has experimented with reducing fares for a limited period. For instance, as a trial measure in May 2017 for a week, it had offered 40% discount and during this period the number of travellers rose by a significant 67%. But after it was withdrawn, the patronage fell by 15%. Similarly in October last year, a 50% discount in fares on Sunday and public holiday made a difference to occupancy rate and nearly 35% more passengers used the system after this plan came into effect.

Easier option

Why discounts instead of reducing fares? “This is because fare reduction is a long and difficult process. It has to be cleared by the top government authorities and if at all it is done, it may be a long struggle to increase them again. We saw this happen with Delhi Metro. Hence, we have been offering discount over a period instead of slashing fares,” an official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/2am4u8/article32829285.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metro-may-offer-30-fare-discount/article32829286.ece
4,2020/10/11,Man arrested for many robberies,"The M.K.B. Nagar Police on Sunday arrested a man who came out on bail recently and committed several robberies in Vyasarpadi, Kodungaiyur, and M.K.B. Nagar.

According to the police, S. Srinivasan, 56, of M.K.B. Nagar is a cashier at a petrol bunk. On Saturday, a customer asked him to fill petrol in his vehicle. Since he said the bunk was closed, the person attacked him with a knife, snatched his mobile phone, and fled the scene.

Similar robberies were reported from Vyasarpadi, Sharma Nagar, MKB Nagar, Kodungaiyur, Tondiarpet High Road, Otteri and Villivakkam on the same night.

The police investigation showed that one person had committed the robberies and arrested Karan alias Karadi Arun, 23, of Vyasarpadi.

6,2020/10/11,How a short film with a nonagenarian actor became possible during lockdown,"Working on 'Can you hear me' amidst the restrictions that COVID-19 had imposed was an immense learning experience, says first-time filmmaker Krishnakumar Balasubramanian.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented filmmakers with a fresh set of challenges — from not being able to shoot at all, to more guarded shooting after the relaxation of the lockdown. But some of the work shot during the pandemic, including the Fahadh Fazil-starrer C U Soon, have shown that good movies are still possible.

For first-time filmmaker Krishnakumar Balasubramanian (KK), several changes had to be made to the original plan, including restricting the number of people on set, to tailoring his short film’s script so that they could shoot a majority of the scenes indoors. He said making a short film amidst the restrictions that COVID-19 had imposed was an immense learning experience.

After hearing about the ‘My RODE Reel’ short film festival that attracts entries from across the world, the theatre and film actor, who is also the artistic director of The Little Theatre, decided to go ahead and make a short film — something he has been keen on for a while now.

The cast and crew members had to get tested before they began shooting.

KK’s short film Can you hear me features his grandmother-in-law Supriya Cheriyan, a 95-year-old actor from the city, and Nirmal Shekar, essaying the main roles. “Didu, as we call her, has always told us that being a part of a film was a dream of hers and this short film presented the perfect opportunity,” he said.

This however meant that they had to be extra cautious during the three-day filming period.

“All of us — cast and crew members — got tested before we began shooting. The number of crew members were restricted — for instance, the cinematographer planned how to shoot keeping in mind the equipment we would need to use. Many of us, including me, doubled up as assistants,” he explained.

Mrs. Cheriyan said: “I initially thought I might not be able to act but I tried my best and it all slowly came together.”

7,2020/10/11,"Cancel bail to repeat offenders to prevent further crime, says Chennai Police Commissioner","‘After the lockdown, criminal activities have almost reached normal levels’

Public prosecutors and police officers have been asked to invoke the provision for cancellation of bail granted to any repeat offender so as to prevent him from committing further crimes. This was informed at a coordination meeting of police officers, public prosecutors and assistant public prosecutors of the city courts here.

Underscoring the importance of close coordination between police and prosecution officers, City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal said, “After a long lockdown, criminal activities have almost reached normal levels. Our idea is to meet the challenges of law and order and crime prevention through legal means, for which both the Police Department and the prosecution have to work in full cooperation and coordination.”

He said prosecution officers could directly contact the Deputy Commissioner in their respective areas if they found any lacunae in evidence collection, FIR drafting and filing of charge sheet.

Stressing the need for invoking the provision for cancellation of the bail granted to repeat offenders, Mr. Aggarwal said a criminal involved in many cases should not be allowed to roam free on the streets and plan to commit another offence. “All of us feel that such criminals have no other place than jail.”

He said that when bail was granted, there was an underlying perception that the criminal would not get into a similar crime again. It was the duty of the criminal justice system, consisting of police and prosecution authorities, to protect society from such criminals.

Distressing situation

“I am personally very anguished when I hear the incidents of crime. Each and every incident of crime brings before me the pain and trauma felt by the victim,” Mr. Aggarwal said, urging police officers and prosecution officials to work to ensure a peaceful society.

The officers were asked to expedite the trial in long-pending cases and get a deterrent punishment. They also analysed causes for the delay in trial and discussed ways to improve production of prosecution witnesses and evidence in courts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1g5552/article32824530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10OCTTHCOP-MEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cancel-bail-to-repeat-offenders-to-prevent-further-crime-says-chennai-police-commissioner/article32824531.ece
8,2020/10/11,University of Madras facing an acute resource crunch,"Without the sanctioned strength, many departments are on the verge of losing additional funding from the University Grants Commission

With 56% of faculty positions lying vacant, University of Madras (UoM) is facing an acute shortage in terms of human resources and potential decline in academic and research activities.

Data available with The Hindu showed that at least seven departments did not have a single full-time faculty member and 14 departments had more than 70% of their sanctioned posts vacant.

The shortage is acutely felt in the three Centres of Advanced Study (CAS) in Mathematics, Botany, Crystallography and Biophysics, which receive additional grants from the University Grants Commission (UGC), and are at risk of losing them without the minimum required faculty strength and research output.

Moreover, an analysis of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) data for the university showed that 50% of the roughly 80 professors are in the age group of 56 and above.

“If the vacancies are not filled in the near future, majority of the departments will not have a single Professor with retirements expected in the coming years,” a senior faculty member said. The last recruitment happened six years ago, but faced some allegations of irregularities.

G. Shanmugam, former Head of CAS in Crystallography and Biophysics and former university syndicate member, said the risk of losing CAS recognition by UGC was real. “We already lost it for the Department of Philosophy in the past,” he said.

The Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics, one of the CAS, has a sanctioned strength of five professors, five associate professors, and 11 assistant professors. However, it presently has only seven assistant professors and not a single professor or associate professor.

The CAS in Botany with a sanctioned strength of 22 faculty members now has one professor and five assistant professors. Stating the department needed a minimum strength of six to maintain the CAS status, Mr. Shanmugam pointed out that N. Mathivanan, the professor and head of the department, is now holding the post of Registrar (in-charge) as well.

Similarly, the CAS in Crystallography and Biophysics had eight faculty members, which included a professor and seven assistant professors, against the sanctioned strength of 18. “The three CAS in the university had many stalwarts in the yesteryears. Now, many departments are not even able to fully utilise their research grants,” Mr. Shanmugam pointed out.

The head of one of the departments, said many departments with research potential were not able to apply for CAS status due to lack of minimum number of faculty. “When a university does not have adequate faculty members, it is not doing justice to its students,” he said.

In a competitive environment with rankings and accreditations, the university would not be able to maintain its status if it did not have competent faculty, who formed the core of the university system, he added.

Pointing out that over 50% of the non-teaching staff positions were also vacant, a Syndicate member said the financial crisis faced by the university had to be tackled with a long-term, sustainable solution.

“A key reason for not recruiting is the deep financial crisis with the university not in a position to even honour its commitments to pensioners. However, without enough faculty we are also losing out on grants from the UGC and the State,” he said.

Vice-Chancellor S. Gowri, who took charge in August, said he was studying the issue to explore possible options to address it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ne48yu/article31511347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THMADRASUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/university-of-madras-facing-an-acute-resource-crunch/article32824515.ece

The Indian Institute of Technology Madras Digital Skill Academy has introduced an online course on business accounting process.

The aim is to upskill or reskill students and professionals seeking a career in finance and accounting. Candidates can enrol at any time of the year. The Digital Skill Academy, along with Bengaluru-based ArthaVidhya, has built an innovative virtual office embedded in an artificial intelligence-based interactive learning management system.

K. Mangala Sunder, head of the Academy, said the course was designed to provide students a simulated office environment to give them a feel of the actual work environment throughout the course.

The course is designed as per the job profiles of NASSCOM (IT-ITeS sector skill council) and certified by them. The general features of the course were reviewed by M. Thenmozhi, a faculty in the Department of Management Studies at the Institute and a former Director of the National Institute of Securities Markets.

SDNB Vaishnav College is also offering the course to its students.

Nimish C. Tolia, trustee, said that after the course was implemented, nearly 70% of the students had been placed in MNCs.

10,2020/10/11,‘Real Estate Regulatory Authority Act is in addition to other laws’,"Regulatory body says its remedies are concurrent with those of the Consumer Protection Act

The Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TNRERA) has ruled that the provisions of the RERA Act are in addition to and not in derogation of other laws.

A.R. Ravisankar, a home buyer, filed a petition before the authority, stating that he booked a flat with Marg Properties Ltd.’s ‘Savithanjali’ project being developed at Kalavakkam village in Thiruporur panchayat limits.

On September 24, 2012, he entered into an agreement of sale and construction for about ₹44 lakh and paid ₹40.9 lakh. The builder agreed to deliver the completed flat by December 2013, with a grace period of three months, according to the petition.

The complainant said the builder had not yet delivered the flat and sought refund of the amount paid, along with interest and compensation.

In its response, Marg Properties said the petitioner had already filed a complaint before the State Consumer Commission and could not use a different forum seeking the same relief.

TNRERA pointed out that the Supreme Court had held that the remedies under the Consumer Protection Act and the RERA were concurrent remedies. Section 88 of the RERA Act made it clear that the application of the provisions of the Act were in addition to, and not in derogation of other laws.

Therefore, the complainant could maintain this complaint for relief under the RERA Act, even if the agreement contained arbitration clause, the TNRERA ruled and directed the builder to refund the amount paid by the buyer with interest of 10.05% a year.

It said the buyer was entitled to ₹69,700 towards the cost of the registration and ₹1 lakh compensation for hardship and mental agony, in addition to ₹20,000 towards litigation expenses.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fzbq1a/article32824495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10OCTTHMULTISTORY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/real-estate-regulatory-authority-act-is-in-addition-to-other-laws/article32824496.ece
11,2020/10/11,Drug cartel operating through mobile application unearthed,"Thiruvanmiyur police arrest three suspects

The Thiruvanmiyur police have unearthed a network that supplied the narcotic party drug MDMA in the city and have arrested three suspects.

After receiving orders on a mobile phone application, the cartel procured the drug from Mumbai, brought it through courier services and supplied it to customers in various parts of the city. The suspects who have been arrested are S. Hussain, 36, of Royapuram; S. Asif Raja, 21, of Tiruvottiyur; and K. Mathi, 35, of Panaiyur. Thirteen grams of MDMA, syringes, three mobile phones, three bikes and cash were seized from them.

The police said the main accused Hussain, a native of Gujarat and working in the city as a customer care executive, had befriended the men through an application. He befriended Mathi, who worked in a medical shop, and started giving him the drug to sell and make money, the police said.

The police first nabbed Asif Raja, a fashion designer, based on information that he was supplying MDMA in syringes at Thiruvanmiyur. On the basis of his statement, the other two were secured.

The three procured MDMA for ₹3,000 per gram from Mumbai and sold it here for ₹6,000. Steps were taken to nab the main suspect operating from Mumbai, a police officer said.

They were booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and remanded in judicial custody.

12,2020/10/11,Chennai Corporation officials to meet ECR residents,"Stormwater drain project to be discussed

The Greater Chennai Corporation will soon convene a meeting of residents living along the East Coast Road (ECR) to explain the details of the integrated stormwater drain (SWD) project from Kottivakkam to Uthandi.

Officials of the civic body said the project was aimed at preventing flooding in localities and that they had also incorporated rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures to ensure recharge of groundwater.

RWH systems

Retention ponds would be created in parks along with 171 RWH wells on road margins and 22,450 RWH pits, explained an official.

Residents have been carrying out agitations against the SWD project. V. Suresh, of Kapaleeswarar Nagar, said the land on the eastern side of the ECR was sandy and did not require any artificial SWD system to carry rainwater.

‘Project not needed’

“This underground aquifer extends from Valmiki Nagar to Uthandi and it absorbs water like a sponge,” he said.

Sushma Erevelles, another resident, said residents from 38 colonies had come together to stop the civic body from implementing the project.

“Floods have never occurred on this side of the ECR, even during the 2015 deluge. The stormwater drain system will only end up becoming a glorified sewage carrier, which we do not want,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-corporation-officials-to-meet-ecr-residents/article32824439.ece
13,2020/10/11,"Most flyers in Chennai airport check-in online, use kiosks for boarding passes","Practice saves time in addition to reducing congestion, say airport officials

Over 50% of air passengers have been opting for web check-in and using kiosks to reduce contact with employees at the airport these past few months after the COVID-19 outbreak.

Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said, “The practice has become the norm now. A majority of passengers own a smartphone and are conscious to avoid any contact with employees inside the airport. So they finish their web check-in at home or office and get e-boarding passes. Otherwise, some just collect the passes at kiosks outside the airport terminal. This saves a lot of time for them and also reduces congestion,” an official said.

Only those who carry a check-in baggage have to necessarily stand in queue for the security scan. However, a baggage tag was no longer used, and passengers instead received an identification number by SMS, officials said.

“Of course, there are passengers who do not own a smartphone or do not have the facility for web check-ins. They are assisted at the entry points by airline staff to fill up self-declaration forms for COVID-19 and then issued boarding passes. Some also go to the counter inside the terminal for the passes,” he added.

The number of passengers now ranges between 12,000 and 14,000 a day with an increase during the weekends and a mild dip during the middle of the week.

“But it has certainly gotten better with time and we hope it will touch 18,000-20,000 a day when the number of flights operated goes up to 200-250 a day. Currently, 130-140 flights are operated per day,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vvs6f0/article32824404.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10OCTTHKIOSKS-CHECK-IN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/most-flyers-in-chennai-airport-check-in-online-use-kiosks-for-boarding-passes/article32824405.ece

The S. Alangulam pond recharges groundwater for houses in Valluvar Colony, Kalai Nagar, Viswanathapuram, Bharathi Nagar and Mudakathan. Kudimaramathu works were undertaken for desilting the pond and constructing a supply channel from Periyar Main Canal to improve the groundwater level. However, the works were discontinued and the residents have started letting sewage water into the canal. This will ultimately find its way into the S. Alangulam pond. If the practice continues, the entire pond will be filled with sewage water and lead to health issues for residents. The authorities must take urgent steps to address this issue.

Roads in Madurai that were dug up for laying drinking water and drainage pipelines are not closed properly once the works are over. This poses a threat to vehicle users.

16,2020/10/11,Zest for work,"My craving for working in my mid-70s is not due to an interest in earning more money

Around 30 years ago, I founded a company, and now in my mid-70s, I am still working as its director and chief executive. Despite my ageing body, I do not want to quit.

During the 30 years, several employees have come and gone. Remembering the poetic line ""Men may come and men may go but I go on for ever"", I seem to be bent upon going on forever pursuing the work that I have been doing for several decades now, until my time will call out. Am I right or wrong?

Several employees in my company are less than half my age. I do not know whether they admire my resolve to work or look at me silently as an ""outdated boss"". But I do not care.

Many professionals retire after long years of service, as they necessarily have to retire under the policy of their establishments. Often, retired persons claim that they live their life the way that they want to or enjoy reading spiritual books, introspecting or involving themselves in social service.

Some people even opt for voluntary retirement, to lead what they fancifully call as an ""alternative way of life"".

In several cases of self-employed persons in business, whatever may be the size and success or otherwise of the business, several of those beyond the age of 60 hand over the responsibility to their children or those dear to their heart and move away from the mainstream of the business to observe from a distance or leave completely.

Somehow, I do not want to move from the area of work that I have chosen for myself several decades ago, in spite of my age.

Several people seem to criticise my attitude, describing me as a greedy or egoistic person or lacking in maturity or unaware of better things in life to focus on.

However, the motivation for me to continue work appears to be my thought process (however, exaggerated it may be) that through my company, I have been contributing to the overall progress of Indian industry, society and economy and my feeling (however, foolish it may be) that my fading away will be a loss for the country and its progress.

Certainly, my craving for continuing to work is not due to any interest in earning more money.

The criticism that by staying on in the job, I am blocking the progress of someone else who can occupy the director position of the company, replacing me, does not appeal to me.

In any case, I do not want to reconcile myself to a situation of forced retirement as per the ""conventional practice"" or due to societal and family pressure. In other words, can I claim that I do not want to survive the rest of my life as a ""lameduck individual""?

Am I an eccentric, workaholic or simply ignorant?

17,2020/10/11,The consumer culture,"The habit of conspicuous and addictive consumption is inflicted on us by corporates and markets with a structured approach

When a big brand in the mobile device industry launches a new improved version of its existing smartphone device, it is for sure to become a hot cake as thousands line up at its stores and on online platforms to buy one. Is this purchase about the attached utility value of the product or a race to possess stuff which one thinks will bring happiness to one’s life?

The above question was answered way back in a different context by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in a speech in the 1970s. ""In a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit communities, and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns. But we’ve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning. We’ve learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose,"" he said.

The desire to possess non-essential worldly items which have literally no meaning and value are insinuated in our life by the materialistic consumer culture and the peer pressure around us. The habit of conspicuous and addictive consumption is inflicted on us by big capitalist corporations and markets in general with a structured and planned approach. The associated attributes of good life are very perspicaciously attached with the lifeless and soulless products by playing with human psychology.

The proposition of chasing materialistic values is making us more and more unhappy. It is derived from the fallacious notion that the more luxuries and wealth you have, the more respect and admiration you get. Unnecessary consumption has definitely increased after globalisation due to higher incomes and increasing inequality. Tools such as social media platforms have been an important instrument in perpetuating it as the new normal. On these platforms, users like you and me have become products for the advertisers, who are their customers.

It’s a vicious cycle where the market will never stop selling and neither does the consumption. We must remember that markets are also an extension of the society we live in. However, they have a distinct ability of being more organised and resourceful around their agendas than our societies as a whole. The market creates demand while understanding consumer behaviour (popular subject in marketing studies) through research and studies. Hence as individuals, we need to do some self-realisation and inner reflection on our own behaviours to understand what prompts us to make these unnecessary and meaningless purchases that they know and we don’t.

We live in such an unequal society where abject poverty and hunger is so rampant. The culture of excessive consumption looks so iniquitous. Let better sense prevail.

18,2020/10/11,Spit and unpolish,"It’s the crudest and most uncivilised message delivered free of cost every day to the world

I grimaced across a hallway, dexterously trying to avoid the betel-stained walls. A friend said that in the past, it was a tradition in India to spit in the corner of the toilet before using it. As I looked cynically at her, she replied it was entirely scientific as the saliva attracted all the germs, viruses and bacteria, leaving the spitter protected from infections. I found this excuse for the Indian spitting habit immensely enjoyable and made a mental note of researching the topic.

It’s not that I was interested in spitting stories, but the moment I notice someone pausing during a conversation, craning the neck and rotating the skull towards the right, I can see what is coming. Spit in all shades and consistency. It is insulting and frustrating as I begin thinking of the innumerable feet and tyres trampling the spit and taking it home. It is this maddening realisation that made me ban footwear and carpets at home.

A far deadlier repercussion was that it is getting more challenging for me day by day to find a house help. I can see is a daily procession of some hundred or so maids, mouths bulging on one side with betel quids, ready to spit on the road or the bushes. I rush out and shout, ""Hey can’t you keep your spit to yourself? You need to be fined."" The fine never happened because, as I discovered, the maintenance in-charge of the building is fond of the habit and often gets rebuked by his wife for staining their bathroom walls. The only impact of my rebuke is that maids decided not to work for me and teach me a lesson.

In history

As I began typing ""history of spitting"", Google did not come up with its innumerable search cues as always and made it evident that I was treading on roads not frequently taken. I read that the Greeks were the first (they always are) in ""ritual spitting"", a term which denotes that spitting was carried out as a good omen and to ward off evil from infants and newly weds. One had to be spit thrice. Why thrice? Because odd numbers are considered lucky in most cultures, and three is the first odd number. I doubt seriously if the Greeks were alone in their glory, for Indian households too have a similar practice. In India, we carry out the ritual with the traditional ""thoo-thoo"" sound.

I am sure that the spitting is meant to be just symbolic and not actual saliva spluttering out, but many a time I have felt it land flat. I had to forgive those genuine well-wishers for taking the practice too seriously. In Kenya, the Maasai tribe greet customarily by spitting into their hands before shaking them as a way of greeting and showing respect to others.

The second type of spitting that I know of is the ""therapeutic"" spitting — a gentle reminder of our reaction upon receiving small cuts or bruises. We put the finger in our mouth, and for other organs, we apply saliva by hand, as it is known to have therapeutic qualities. Our children have learnt it from us, and interestingly, this is a trait we share with other mammals.

As I felt a tinge of panic that spitting might be branded a prerogative of the developing countries alone, I discovered that the U.S. was no different once. For a long time, the U.S. and Europe hardly questioned the existence of spitting in their lives and were proud owners of public spittoons. In 1882, the German bacteriologist Robert Koch identified the notorious germ: Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Campaigns were carried out, and after several courtroom battles, spitting or expectoration in public was made illegal.

Well, as I googled more, I revelled in the quirky ""competitive"" spitting competitions held in different parts of the world. A cherry-pit spitting competition in Michigan and cricket-spitting is part of the annual Bug Bowl at Purdue University in Indiana. An olive-pit spitting competition held in Israel hoped to break the world record of nearly 100 feet.

My interest in spitting doesn’t end with the limited research done. If we go by western and Indian cinematic overtures, spitting is a vital act and reveals much about the character that spits. Perhaps my next research paper shall explore spitting as an expression of human emotions and predicaments in literature. Hey! Do not plagiarise my idea, for I spat it out accidentally!

Making a statement

Art is an imitation of reality, and so we know that characters in real life too use spitting to make statements. It is considered a sign of masculinity. Spitting on the ground in front of someone is supposed to show disrespect, anger, rudeness, arrogance and even bullying. It can also show fearlessness, for if one is nervous, he is supposed to swallow the saliva, right? Spitting is used to look down upon someone and boosts the self-esteem of the spitter. A classy signature indeed.

For a country like ours, spitting is not just a style statement any more; it is the crudest and the most uncivilised message delivered free of cost every day to the world. It is an insult to every soul that treads upon it. Each year, nearing Gandhiji’s birth anniversary, we pick up the broom and force ourselves to imagine a cleaner and healthier India. Though government agendas have made hygiene and cleanliness their top picks, the people are yet to embrace it with panache. To make matters bright for spitters, they hardly pay the penalty. The only answer, perhaps, is to develop acute revulsion and intolerance in public for spitting and spitters. What if habitual spitters are offered an opportunity to spit in their water tanks and earthen pots for a change? The idea is offensive, yet isn’t it better to swallow our spit rather than devour our dignity?

19,2020/10/11,A necessary evil,"Technology has become such an integral part of life that a complete alienation from it is impossible

Finally, I have changed my relationship with technology

Some time ago, I would often feel low, anxious. I would have only a slight interest in the outside world. With a little introspection, I realised that I was paying too little attention to my family, friends and colleagues. Why? I couldn’t figure it out. Some more self-examination revealed I was also thinking negatively and behaving pessimistically. Little more reflection led me to understand that I was indulging too much in my smartphone, television and laptop.

So, I deleted many social media apps, quit many messaging groups and moderated my television viewing and laptop surfing. I also moved my e-mails from my phone to the laptop. In a nutshell, I did cleanse myself of overindulgence in technology. I also experienced calmness, control over my thinking and emotions and composure. I felt a sense of ease in my relationship with myself and the outside world. Consequently, I saved a lot of time for things closer to my heart and meaningful for my life. Finally, I decided to take up the cudgels against technology.

My first point against technology is that it lures me to multitasking. I feel I can watch television and keep messaging and e-mailing on the phone simultaneously and save time. But it’s a myth. Actually, there is nothing called multitasking. When you shift from one task to another, you stop doing the first task. And when you come back to the first, research says that you take 20 minutes to be mentally ready for it. Thus, switching between two different tasks consumes more time than finishing two separately.

Technology also makes me feel like a nomad. When I am looking for a story on the Internet, I wander away to something else. I don’t even realise that. After some time, when I realise my drift, it’s too late. And by then, I have lost my time and energy and especially interest in the original story I was looking for. Resultantly, I lose focus and direction.

Junk information

With its power of fast dissemination, technology has helped create an economic model of the news and information industry in which most of the news and information is available free. Free news and information attract me to welcome even junk news and information regardless of its quality, authenticity and need. After going through a deluge of substandard, unverified and undesirable news and information, I don’t feel wiser. Free news robs my most precious treasure — my attention. But why is my attention and focus so important? Because I lose the direction of my internal narrative and miss the story that I want to tell myself. My story is the source of my relationships with the outside world. Unfortunately, I do not even realise that my story has changed or it is changing slowly.

My other sore point against technology is that it hacks my neutrality and objectivity. It feeds me with a lot of information which I cannot verify with my limited resources. It prompts me to believe whatever I am fed with. I lose my power of reasoning and the strength of logic. I am not able to develop a perspective of what I see, read and hear. I squander my impartiality and fairness. Finally, I lose my voice, my inner voice.

When I read a book, I need to flip a page to move to a new page. In fact, it’s a cue to pause. Similarly, a chapter in a book and the end of an episode of a TV series are the stopping signals. These signals give me a moment to reassess if I should continue or take a break. But now technology is designing social media apps that cancel out any stopping cue. It just wants me to move from one video to another, unthinkingly. I am afraid I would become its slave.

Technology has also changed the human interface from services like guest hosting and taxi hiring. Now, there is very little cordial human interaction and experience left in such services. I don’t get a chance to interact with my cab driver and develop a relationship. At most, I talk to an anonymous person sitting thousands of miles away in a huge call centre. It lowers the quality of human understanding, changes the essence of the personal human transaction and finally kills the relationship.

Many unknowns

And my last but the most worrisome point against technology is that it unravels not just the known but many unknowns too. When technology wasn’t there to be accused of stealing privacy, even then, as a stone-age man, I closely protected my privacy. But in the past few decades, technology has silently unclothed my privacy. I am uncomfortably satisfied with technology till the time I know what, when and how much of my private space it is intruding into. So far it was about my known. But with interventions like Artificial Intelligence (AI), technology now peeps into my unknown, which even I am not aware of — my pulse rate, my blood pressure, my expressions, my mood, and my sweat. I am scared that AI has the potential to read my feelings, potential thinking style, and actions. But why should I be worried if AI can read my mood, facial expressions, thinking and actions? Simply because then it would judge me as a person. Consequently, I would lose my self-worth. Maybe in this process, I would become a subject or slave to the hidden agenda of some corporation or state. And finally, I would lose my freedom, both physical and emotional.

However, can I discard technology for its ill offerings and subjugating dominance over me? The truth is that technology has become such an integral part of my life that a complete alienation from technology seems impossible. Therefore, my dilemma is that on the one hand, I can’t overindulge in technology at the cost of my peace, happiness, and freedom and on the other, I can’t become its slave. I feel I need to go back to Aristotle’s golden mean where I find the right balance between overexposure of technology which kills my freedom and its ascetic separation which robs my comfort.

20,2020/10/11,Embalmed epistles,"They were not posted, but preserved

I have a bunch of old unsent letters with me, entrusted to me by my colleagues years ago to be dropped into the postbox of a main post office on my way home from office. Those were the days when people solely depended on the postal service for communication. Couriers were unknown. E-mail was science fiction.

I forgot to post these letters, though their poor authors repeatedly pleaded that I should not for heaven’s sake forget to post them. Now after 30-odd years, I am not able to forget the words of caution with which each of them was handed over to me. The oldest is an inland from one Mr. T who said, “Please post it at T. Nagar main post office. It carries a very important message. Heads will roll if it fails to reach the addressee by tomorrow.” This letter dated March 11, 1981 is still lying in front of me. When I first found it lying in my bag about two weeks after I undertook to post it, I panicked. I thought of immediately posting it at the General Post Office. But my brother to whom I confessed my crime told me not to do so. “If you post it now, the postal mark will give you away. If anything bad was to happen due to this letter not reaching the addressee, it should have happened already,” he said. I took his advice and placed it in a black box in which others of its kind were laid to rest.

Once I even felt tempted to open these letters to know if they really contained any important message or matter. I nipped this urge in the bud not only because I considered it indecent to read others’ letters but also because I feared that they might haunt me for a lifetime. I can neither post them now nor bring myself to destroy them. I know there is the Dead Letter Office, where undeliverable letters get dumped.

Once I thought of sending these forgotten-to-be-posted epistles there. But I gave up that idea.

The reason was that these letters are not dead. They are very much alive. Whenever I touch them, they give me a mild shock. I am sorry to mention here that three of the writers of these live letters are dead. It is ironic that the letters are alive, but their writers are not. Could anyone suggest a way by which I can be delivered of these live letters?

21,2020/10/11,Ruminating over old IMs,"It was a new kind of reminiscence, one that can only be viewed and eludes other senses

My old smartphone alerted me to its dwindling storage space as WhatsApp and its undeleted messages occupied two-thirds of the memory. Deciding to delete old chats, I chanced upon conversations from four or five years ago. Those texts were from happier and sad times and when I could have dealt with conversations with more maturity.

I realised a new kind of reminiscence fast emerging — one that can only be viewed and eludes other senses. Instant messages (IM) lack the fragrance of that old teakwood cupboard at grandma’s place or the musty smell of grandpa’s books. They are not like the photo album with a layer of dust waiting to be wiped off and held. Nor do they sound like the souvenir tin of chocolates emptied with our best mates long ago and now carrying a few pins, clips, and cheap jewellery. Old chats from a couple of years ago lack “antiquity”, but they hold special value because they serve as a reflection of who we were and where we were headed as a social animal.

Texts make us question our past selves. We could cringe at that emoji we sent to an arrogant show-off. Or we could be humbled by a heartfelt note of appreciation for a petty service. Old chats serve as a testimony to our life’s path, the direction it has taken through the choices we made.

The era of letters, or snail mail, basks in unique glory. People were aware of another’s reality on a longer time scale — a reality that changed slowly and shared many common elements with our own. In an era when a sender knew about a receiver’s culture and attitudes, minds hardly stressed about reactions. What made a letter cherished is the effort of putting pen to paper, portraying sparks of imagination even while being fully present in one’s own reality, excitement of sliding it in a letter box and surprising the reader on delivery. The accompanying wait and enthusiasm to receive it enriched the entire experience of communication.

Immediate reality

The IM scenario is starkly different. For one, we do not know the immediate reality of the receiver to expect instant gratification. Unmet expectations naturally build tensions and anxiety. Bombarded with a cacophony of opinions, emotions and updates 24x7, IM is enough reason for a burnout.

The idea of IM apps was to connect people and bring them closer. In contrast, we are socially disconnected from the people around us. By creating personal micro-cultures, we have chosen to seek comfort and a sense of identity on the other side of the screen by disregarding their personal reality.

True connection lies in our decision to send a heart-warming note rather than a meaningless forward to our dear ones. It lies in our decision to inform our peers we need time off to pick up our pieces rather than block them curtly without answering their concerns. It also lies in our decision to call and talk about our emotions rather than text them.

Why did we start fearing calls that can put our mind at ease in an instant rather than wait for a text? Because the other side is busy or to avoid confrontation? Or maybe, we fear embarrassing our vulnerable selves in person to be deluded by the idea that texts provide a safer outlet? The most difficult conversations that happen over texts leave both parties in despair because of misinterpretation. The question now is, are texts overwhelming us? What we choose to do between ignoring, delaying our response or instantly responding is how we break or build connections. If there’s one reason why people overthink before connecting via IM, it is the pressure to come across as being politically right, and convey their message without misinterpretation.

22,2020/10/11,Bijolia’s resonance,"Farmers in this Rajasthan town rose in revolt against cruel taxes imposed by a chieftain during the pre-Independence period

When farmers across the country are protesting against the new farm laws, the Rajasthan town of Bijolia comes to the mind of people who know the history of pre-Independence peasant movements in India.

Bijolia, along the National Highway 27 in Bhilwara district and almost 50 km from Kota, was part of Mewar prior to Independence. During the freedom struggle, the peasant movement in the town narrated a tale of the power of the common man. The movement started in 1897, led by Sadhu Sitaram. Rao Krishna Singh was the chieftain of Bijolia and Maharana Fateh Singh the ruler of Mewar.

Krishna Singh imposed many taxes on the farmers, even one on the marriage of their daughters. With the imposts hurting their finances, the common men tried to raise their voice in the royal court of Mewar. But it went in vain.

Krishna Singh died in 1906, and his successor, Prithvi Singh, exceeded him in imposing taxing levies. It gave a new momentum to the agitation.

To exhibit their wrath, farmers put off the marriages of their daughters. Vijay Singh Pathik, a legendary freedom fighter, joined the movement in 1916 and started leading it. He wrote several articles in the famous newsletter Pratap at that time. British authorities were compelled to form an enquiry commission headed by Justice Bindu Lal Bhattacharya.

84 taxes

Farmers were paying 84 different types of taxes at that time. Several British officials tried to solve the issue, but to no avail. When Pathik was forbidden from entering the area, leaders like Seth Jamuna Lal, Haribhau Upadhyaya and Manik Lal Verma took over the mantle.

The farmers could get rid of the unjustified taxes only in 1941, after a continuous struggle of 44 years. But the town, which provided a consort to the great fighter Maharana Pratap, did not lose courage against any atrocity.

Bijolia is famous for its association with the 23rd Jain Tirthankara or Lord Parshwanath. The 24th Tirthankara, Vardhamana Mahaveer, was born almost 250 years after him. People from across the world visit the big temple dedicated to him in the town. The temple built in AD 1170 is counted among the most sacred places of Jainism.

23,2020/10/11,"Only mask, no magic","Crying ‘abracadabra’ will not stop the virus; it needs only simple steps such as wearing a mask

Abracadabra! In the second century AD, Serenus Sammonicus, a sage and physician to the Roman emperor, wrote in Liber Medicinalis that wearing an amulet of parched paper with a triangular encryption of this word at the top and just an ‘A’ at the bottom tip would drive away lethal diseases. It was widely practised to ward off malaria at that time.

Even during the Great Plague of the 17th century, many Londoners pasted the amulet on their doorways to ward off evil and illnesses. With improvements in hygiene and scientific understanding, abracadabra got relegated from its supposed role in preventing diseases to a loud utterance by magicians while pulling out rabbits from hats.

The relentless march of COVID-19, despite significant knowledge about the mode of its spread, makes one wonder whether the amulet of yore has to be revisited. Proper use of a simple cloth mask that covers the nose and mouth, along with physical distancing, is the most effective means to stall the spread of the virus. Instead, the mask is often worn round the neck, like an amulet. The reasons for such a strange adornment varies from excuses such as “can’t breathe” to reassurances such as “nothing will happen and don’t be scared”. Psychiatrists have an explanation for this behaviour — denial.

DABDA method

In 1969, Elizabeth Kubler Ross, a Swiss-American psychiatrist, described five stages of response to the stress of grief — denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance, or DABDA. On hearing bad news or an adverse diagnosis, patients and their immediate relatives often go through the DABDA stages.

While dealing with heart attacks, doctors try to navigate quickly from the first stage of denial to the fifth of acceptance and get an “informed consent” to start treatment. Staying far too long in denial with statements such as “Doctor, are you sure?” and “No, it can’t be, let’s wait for more relatives to come” will cause more damage to the heart muscle with each minute of delay. Most doctors are sensitive to the DABDA responses, while some patients wish for a quick magical solution, akin to abracadabra.

Extrapolating the stage of denial to the current pandemic, non-compliance with effective measures of prevention such as masking and social distancing is letting the virus spread far and wide. The high recovery rate is reassuring, but the virus wreaks havoc on the elderly and those with co-morbidities. The pandemic has strained healthcare facilities and prevented appropriate treatment of other illnesses.

Faced with the stress of the pandemic, many experience anger and bargain with alternative modalities. In the eastern States of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal and in Uttar Pradesh, people perform rituals to appease corona devi and corona mai, a clear manifestation of fear and despair triggering superstition. Even among the literate, the initial novelty of spending more time at home, doing household chores and sharing it on social media have given way to despair and depression.

As the saying goes, “When the going gets tough, the tough get going.” Novel avenues for staying connected in the virtual world through watch parties, karaoke groups and Web meetings have a stabilising effect and keep the mood upbeat. The faint-hearted should avoid unnecessary exposure to disturbing and repetitive information from television channels; instead focus on building mental and physical stamina through online classes for dance, yoga or exercise.

While breaking bad news, the doctor is able to communicate effectively when the patient reaches the stage of acceptance. Recovery is faster and better in patients who pull themselves up, accept the situation and prepare to move towards the best solution possible. Applying the same coping mechanism to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sooner we accept the proven preventive measures and prepare for the “new normal”, the better it is for everyone. It is high time we all said, “exit abracadabra”, and moved forward collectively from “denial” to “acceptance”.

24,2020/10/11,Eknath Khadse will defect soon: Sena Minister,"BJP leader refuses to comment on matter after returning to Jalgaon from Mumbai

Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra Minister Gulabrao Patil on Sunday lent further credence to the speculation of estranged senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse's possible defection, remarking that it was true that Mr. Khadse would be changing his political colours soon.

Mr. Patil, an MLA from the Jalgaon Rural constituency and Minister of State for Water Supply and Sanitation, said he was not aware of which party the BJP leader would eventually join or of whom he was in touch with.

“While I do not know who Eknath Khadse is in touch with at the moment, it certainly is true that he will change his party,” said Mr. Patil, while responding to questions whether the disgruntled Mr. Khadse would be joining Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) or the Sena.

Since the past few days, rumours have been swirling thick and fast that Mr. Khadse would be entering the NCP fold. It was even rumoured that Mr. Khadse would be meeting with Mr. Pawar while he was in Mumbai recently. The BJP leader, however, refused to comment on the matter after his return to Jalgaon on Sunday.

Sena leaders like Abdul Sattar, Uday Samant and Mr. Patil himself, have been urging Mr. Khadse, a stalwart leader from north Maharashtra, to join the Sena.

After being denied a ticket in the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly polls and following the defeat of his daughter Rohini Khadse in the same election, Mr. Khadse has been vocal about his disenchantment with his party.

Since the conclusion of the Assembly polls, a major schism has emerged within the Maharashtra BJP leadership with the top brass fearing a possible intra-party revolt by notable OBC leaders led by Mr. Khadse, former ministers Pankaja Munde and Prakash Mehta, and other leaders who were either denied a ticket or suffered upset defeats in the election.

Mr. Khadse was reportedly upset with then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, the BJP’s leader in the State, for his ‘authoritarian style’ of running the party and eliminating potential ‘rivals’ in a Machiavellian fashion.

At the time, the OBC leaders had blamed Mr. Fadnavis for engineering their defeats and denying them tickets. Mr. Khadse has consistently maintained that there had been a ‘conspiracy’ by certain leaders in the State BJP unit to ensure the defeats of Ms. Munde and his daughter, Rohini, and that the move was aimed at finishing off his political career.

26,2020/10/11,Cruise vessel MV Karnika to discontinue operations,"Mounting debts, uncertainties posed by COVID-19 behind move

The owners of MV Karnika, a 14-deck large premium cruise vessel whose home port is Mumbai, have decided to discontinue its operations due to mounting debts and the uncertainties posed by COVID-19.

Operations have been at a standstill since creditors arrested the ship through an order of the Admiralty Court on March 17. The owners said they are not in a position to start operations as ports in the country have not given a specific date to resume cruise services owing to the pandemic.

No information has been made available if the operations of the passenger vessel, with a capacity to carry 2,014 passengers and 621 crew members, will be revived later.

MV Karnika is the first cruise vessel acquired by Jalesh Cruises Mauritius Ltd., majority owned by Subhash Chandra, the chairman of Essel Group, and his family. Mr. Chandra aimed to build a robust cruise tourism industry in India and invested in the project before the financial crisis hit his group. Despite having other investors, he took personal interest to develop this sector as he felt it had vast scope of employment generation.

MV Karnika was the first large cruise vessel to home port in Mumbai and operate to domestic and international destinations. It was also part of the plan to build Mumbai as a major cruise port.

Supplies running out

“Owners have also appealed to the [Bombay] High Court and the [Mumbai] Port Trust for assistance to provide fuel, power and basic supplies to the 60 crew members that are on the ship. However, they have yet to receive an update on their appeal from the High Court along with the Port Trust,” a statement from the owners said. “Unfortunately, due to this delay, the crew on the ship are living in poor conditions with no fuel, power. We are hoping to get the crew members signed off and relieve them so that they can go home as soon as the legal formalities are completed,” it said.

The crew members who are running out of fuel to run the engine and essential supplies have reportedly demanded their pending wages to be paid before being allowed to leave.

In a statement the management said, “We would like to reassure the crew and their families that we have not forgotten about them, hence, have put the right wheels in motion. We have asked for urgent indulgence with the relevant authorities and are waiting for their feedback.”

Plan to send crew home

“In addition, we assure our crew members that they will receive their salaries as soon as the funds are received. Main priority is to reunite the crew with their families,” it added.

MV Karnika has been docked in Mumbai since March 12 and has not been in operation. Its maiden voyage from Mumbai was in April 2019.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jd4rc0/article32829146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMMVKARNIKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cruise-vessel-mv-karnika-to-discontinue-operations/article32829147.ece
27,2020/10/11,"Cannot go easy on the virus now, says Uddhav Thackeray","State govt. moving cautiously on restarting trains, and opening gyms and temples

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said the State government “cannot go easy on virus now” and is moving cautiously on restarting trains, and opening gyms and temples.

“Restarting locals will be a huge step. Most people want to travel by train and it’s a huge necessity. However, the crowds it creates is more worrying at this moment. We are empathetic to people’s concerns and will soon reach a decision on this,” he said in his address to the State on Sunday.

“Not only do we feel responsible for our citizens, but we also care for them deeply. Therefore, we are taking steps to restart cautiously and slowly. Restaurants are now operational. We are working towards restarting gyms after carefully thinking of the threats at hand. We will soon reach a decision on this,” he said.

Taking note of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s agitation to reopen temples, Mr. Thackeray said people can make any sort of demands, “but it is ultimately I who has to take care of the State”.

Appealing to citizens to wear masks and maintain social distancing, Mr. Thackeray said be it a train, bus, office, public toilet or any public space, wearing masks is a must. “One cannot go easy on the virus now. We are opening up spaces, but if cases continue to rise, we may have to go back for a lockdown. I appeal to everyone to follow the norms,” he said.

Mr. Thackeray said 449 COVID-19 testing labs have been set up in Maharashtra. Of the 15,18,734 patients, 12,55,779 have been discharged after recovery, and around 80% have mild to moderate symptoms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gbcuec/article32829127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMUddhav-Thackeray,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cannot-go-easy-on-the-virus-now-says-uddhav-thackeray/article32829128.ece
28,2020/10/11,Metro car shed in Mumbai to move from Aarey to Kanjurmarg,"Environmentalists welcome decision; 800 acres in Aarey declared as forest area; cases against protesters to be dropped: Maharashtra CM

Fulfilling one of its promises in the Shiv Sena election manifesto, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced the shifting of the Metro car shed from the Aarey forest area in the western suburbs to a government plot in Kanjurmarg in the eastern suburbs at “zero cost”.

“We all are aware of the Metro car shed construction issues at Aarey. They were raised even before the Assembly elections last year. I was not the Chief Minister then but was heading the party contesting the elections, and we opposed the plan at that time,” Mr. Thackeray said in a webcast.

“The car shed will now be moved to Kanjurmarg. So questions will arise as to who will bear these costs. Let me make this clear today. The State government has allotted the land for Metro for “zero rupees”,” he said.

The Chief Minister said the move to build the car shed at Aarey had seen a lot of protests, agitations, cutting of trees at night, and charges filed against protesters. “The Cabinet has decided to drop all charges filed against the protesters striving to protect the environment,” he added.

Mr. Thackeray said the building which has come up in the Aarey site will be utilised for some other public purpose. “About ₹100 crore expenditure was incurred for the purpose and it won’t go waste,” he said.

Nearly 800 acres in Aarey has been declared as forest area, making it the first extensive forest blossoming within city limits anywhere in the world, the CM said. “The State government has ensured that the rights of the tribal communities, stable owners and other stakeholders in the area are protected,” he said.

In another move likely to benefit Mumbaikars, Mr. Thackeray announced that Metro 3 and Metro 6 lines will be joined, facilitating direct connectivity of the eastern suburbs with south Mumbai.

The 33.5 km fully underground Metro-3 line, being constructed by Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd., runs from Colaba in south Mumbai to Seepz in the western suburbs. The 14.47 km Metro 6 runs from Lokhandwala to Kanjurmarg.

At the peak of protests by environment activists, students and residents over construction of the car shed in Aarey, the proposed site was cleared with the cutting of trees in the dead of the night. The Shiv Sena, which was then an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led ruling alliance in the State under Devendra Fadnavis, was vocal in its opposition to the construction.

Cases had been filed against several green activists, political workers and students who were detained for opposing the government action. While Mr. Fadnavis remained undeterred, the Sena had promised to stop construction of the car shed if it came to power.

One of the first decisions of Mr. Thackeray, on being sworn in as head of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government last year, was to stop work on the car shed. The government also appointed a committee to study feasibility of the project. Last month, the Cabinet initiated proceedings to declare the Aarey site as a forest area.

Unfortunate, says Fadnavis

Mr. Fadnavis termed the decision unfortunate and one taken to satisfy the ruling party’s ego. “This decision will increase the cost of the project by at least ₹4,000 crore. This cost escalation is assessed by the committee appointed by this government,” he said.

“The Kanjurmarg site was earlier considered by the government, but it was under litigation and stayed by the High Court. Some private individuals claimed their rights and the stay was requested to be withdrawn. However, the court wanted the amount to be deposited if the claims got settled in future,” said Mr. Fadnavis.

He said that the amount was around ₹2,400 crore in 2015. “What is the status of that case today? And if someone moves the Supreme Court, who will be responsible for the delay?” he asked.

Moreover, since the site in Kanjurmarg is a marshy land, it will require at least two years to stabilise it, he added, claiming that all the previous tenders will have to be scraped and a new process will have to be followed now.

“This means that the Metro project, which would have been in the service of Mumbaikars just next year, has now been postponed indefinitely,” said the ex-CM.

‘Win for both’

Reacting to the announcement on Sunday afternoon, Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said, “Aarey Saved”.

Opposition BJP said the Chief Minister’s claims were misleading. “The land in Kanjurmarg in under litigation. The expert committee had recommended existing Aarey land for the project,” said BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar.

Countering this, Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik of the Nationalist Congress Party and an MVA ally, said, “Maharashtra CM has made an announcement as he had promised during polls. It is extremely wrong to question the authenticity of information he has provided.”

The move has been welcomed by environmental activists who thanked the MVA government. “The blackmail of Aarey or Metro has finally ended. It’s a win for both Aarey and Metro today. We thank the government, especially CM and Environment Minister for the decision,” said Stalin D. one of the leading green activists who had been fighting against the car shed and demanding that Aarey land be declared a forest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3tpj8z/article30686995.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BMMETROCARSHED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/aarey-metro-car-shed-to-be-relocated-uddhav/article32826394.ece
29,2020/10/11,French Open | Nadal swats aside Djokovic to tie with Federer on 20 Grand Slams,"Nadal, 34, claimed his 100th match win at Roland Garros against just two defeats since his 2005 debut.

Spain’s Rafael Nadal demolished world number one Novak Djokovic of Serbia 6-0, 6-2, 7-5 in the French Open final to claim a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam title on Sunday.

With his record-improving 13th triumph at Roland Garros, world number two Nadal is now tied with Swiss Roger Federer as the player with the most men’s singles Major titles.

Nadal was the early aggressor as he choked Djokovic to win the opening set in brutal fashion having made only two unforced errors. He then kept a firm grip on a subdued Djokovic in the second set.

Brief rebellion

Djokovic, who was looking to win his 18th Grand Slam title, rebelled in the third set, breaking back for 3-3, only to drop serve on a double fault in the 11th game before Nadal went on to bag his 100th victory at Roland Garros with an ace.

“First of all of course congrats to Novak for another great tournament, sorry for today,” Nadal, who has now beaten Djokovic in all of their three French Open finals, said on court.

“In Australia (in the final in 2019) he killed me. We’ve played so many times, one day one wins, another day the other wins.”

The 34-year-old Nadal would not think of matching Federer’s mark.

“To win here means everything. I don’t think today about the 20th and equal Roger on this great number, today is just a Roland Garros victory and that means everything to me,” the world number two said.

“This love story I have with this city and this court is unforgettable.”

When Nadal ended it with an ace, he dropped to his knees, smiled widely and pumped his arms.

Nadal, No. 2 in the rankings, improved to 100-2 at the French Open, including a combined 26-0 in semifinals and finals, and picked up his fourth consecutive title in Paris.

Previous streaks

The 34-year-old previously put together streaks of four French Open championships from 2005-08, then five in a row from 2010-14, to go alongside his four trophies at the U.S. Open, two at Wimbledon and one at the Australian Open.

Nadal is now even with Federer for the first time since each man had zero Slams to his name in 2003.

30,2020/10/11,All about an idli: British prof’s tweet sparks not so ‘boring’ debate,"The idli moved from the accounts of thousands of Twitter users to national and some international media.

Some would say it’s much ado about the idli, that humble staple of south India and the centre of furious debate on social media after a British academic disparaged it as boring. And others that this is a cultural, civilisational issue and the brouhaha is entirely in keeping with its status in the annals of India’s diverse cuisine.

Either which way, the steamed rice and lentil ‘cake’ — a pan India favourite, a must-figure in most breakfast buffets, and the choice of the discerning dieter as well as the foodie for its health quotient — is suddenly much talked about and much discussed.

Paired mostly with coconut chutney, sambhar and some spicy gunpowder soaked in ghee, the idli moved from the accounts of thousands of Twitter users to national and also some international media outlets with several food writers and journalists dishing up articles that explored its origins and reflected the social media debate.

It all began with British historian Edward Anderson responding to a question from food aggregator with this innocuous statement on Twitter, “Idlis are the most boring things in the world.”

Idli are the most boring things in the world. https://t.co/2RgHm6zpm4 — Edward Anderson (@edanderson101) October 6, 2020

And the floodgates opened.

Author and Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram Shashi Tharoor termed the professor “truly challenged” and Twitter users, some indignant, some passionate and some tongue firmly in cheek, flooded the microblogging site with variations of why they like the Indian rice cakes and also why they don’t.

Mr. Tharoor’s son Ishaan Tharoor, a US-based columnist, said, “I think I have encountered the most offensive take on Twitter.”

“Yes, my son, there are some who are truly challenged in this world. Civilisation is hard to acquire: the taste & refinement to appreciate idlis, enjoy cricket, or watch ottamthullal is not given to every mortal. Take pity on this poor man, for he may never know what Life can be,” tweeted the Congress MP.

Video: In conversation with Eniyavan who makes pizza idlies and kungfu panda idlies

Anderson, whose Twitter bio states that he works on the politics and history of India & Britain, migration & diasporas, did also say his wife is from Kerala. He may have found the idli boring but loves basically all south Indian food.

But idli fans were up in arms nonetheless. The idli has found a place in the Indian plate — and palate — because it light on the stomach, inexpensive and tasty too, said many food lovers, historians and critics alike.

Terming Mr. Tharoor’s tweet a valid response to Mr. Anderson, food historian Pushpesh Pant said the beautiful and perfectly balanced food is not just healthy but cost effective too as the batter can be used over several days for different dishes.

“I think idli is a beautiful and perfectly balanced food. It has lentils, it has rice and it gives you a very interesting mix of vegetable proteins. It is a steamed food, it doesn’t take too much oil to make, also it is easy to digest.”

“The batter you prepare to make idli on the first day can be used to make idli which is the softest, second day you make dosas which are slightly less fluffy, third day you use it for uttapam, so this cycle continues,” Mr. Pant told PTI.

While the basics of making a steamed rice cake remain the same — rice flour, urad dal (black gram) and a fermenting agent — several versions of the idli are available in India’s south.

If in some parts of Karnataka the flat saucer-shaped ‘thatte idli’ is preferred, in others ‘muday idli’ steamed after being wrapped in pine or coconut palm leaves has foodies salivating.

Apart from the most commonly available plain idli and sambar from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the coastal state of Goa has the ‘sanna’, a savoury steamed rice cake shaped like a hockey puck. The unlikely combination of idli with chicken or mutton curry can be found in Andhra Pradesh.

Although he is not an idli fan, food critic Rahul Verma believes the taste comes from what it is eaten with. “Idli doesn’t have a taste of its own, it depends on what goes with it. Idli either with chutney or sambar, or chicken, mutton or pork curries make all the difference,” he said.

On his food journeys, Mr. Verma has enjoyed gunpowder idlis from Tamil Nadu, mini idlis with fried chicken from Andhra Pradesh and the softest ones from Karnataka. But he can’t forget the idlis, far from its native land in south, he had at a bus stop in Karnal, Haryana.

“I broke two spoons trying to eat those idlis. I can only request everyone to make only what they are capable of,” Mr. Verma said.

“Famous food historian KT Achaya had written some path breaking books on the origin of different food in India. According to him, idli came to India from Indonesia. The cooks employed by the Indonesian Hindu kings may have made the first idli. And it came to India during the 9th to 12th centuries, but people here wouldn’t believe in that origin,” Mr. Verma added.

For Neelima Vaid, an MA student and home foodie from Delhi, the best idlis are those made by her mother.

“She adds dry fruits to it, sometimes roasted ones, and it adds an entirely different taste and texture to idli. I know people say idli is all about what goes along with it, but homemade idlis stuffed with dry fruits — you don’t need anything with that,” Ms. Vaid said.

Food critic Pritha Sen said almost every Indian state has a steamed dish similar in concept but idli became the best known because its patrons took it all over the world.

The easiest that comes to mind is Gujarat with their dhoklas and stuff, in Bengal we have something called ‘bhapa pithe’. “...but unfortunately the urban elites have kind of forgotten this... the Udupis have gone out and spread it across the world. The rest of India has somehow not been able to do that,” she rued.

Before the debate heated up in India, it had found a connect in the U.S. election.

Democratic vice presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris, during her maiden address to the Indian-American community in August, recalled how her Indian origin mother always wanted to instill in her a “love of good idli”.

“Growing up, my mother would take my sister Maya and me back to what was then called Madras because she wanted us to understand where she had come from and where we had ancestry. And of course, she always wanted to instill in us, a love of good idli,” Ms. Harris said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/lp3xip/article29397947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Idli-paati-6,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/all-about-an-idli-british-profs-tweet-sparks-not-so-boring-debate/article32826490.ece

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Google has rolled out a new feature to Google Meet that will allow teachers or educators to divide the participants on a group video call in up to 100 breakout rooms.

The update currently available to customers of G Suite Enterprise for Education, will enable educators to break the class in smaller groups for simultaneous small group discussions or working time.

To create a breakout room, tap on the Activities in the top right, and then breakout rooms. In the Breakout rooms panel, choose the number of different rooms.

Only event creators can create breakout rooms and once the meeting starts, Google will automatically divide people in different rooms randomly. However, it enables moderators to distribute people into different rooms as per their choice.

To manually move people into different rooms, either enter the participant’s name or click the participant’s name, hold down the mouse, drag the name, and then drop it into another breakout room.

To randomly mix up the groups again, click Shuffle. Then tap in the bottom right and click Create.

Google said the feature was a highly requested one and breakout rooms must be created during a video call on a computer. As of now, breakout rooms cannot be live streamed or recorded.

Participants must sign up to their Google accounts from a computer or the app to join the meeting, failing which they will not be assigned to a breakout room.

Participants can later re-join the original meeting following their smaller group discussion. Meanwhile, moderators can also jump between breakout rooms to monitor and participate in discussions.

There will be no admin control of this feature and will be available to Google Meet by default in a few days starting October 8.

Google said the feature will be added to additional Google Workspace editions later this year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/yb7a2g/article32827000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/google-meet-breakout-rooms-imageJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-meet-will-let-users-create-100-breakout-rooms-in-a-call/article32826983.ece
32,2020/10/11,"Hotel Wi-Fi networks favour guest convenience over strong security, FBI warns","The lack of a hotel industry standard for secure Wi-Fi connection is also a reminder that guests should not implicitly trust the hotel has a secured connection or that it is actively monitoring for attacks.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a statement warning users of the risks of using hotel room W-Fi connections.

Accessing sensitive information from hotel Wi-Fi poses an increased risk over home networks. Malicious actors can exploit inconsistent or lax security and guests’ complacency to compromise work and personal data of hotel guests.

Hotel networks are built to favour guest convenience over robust security practices, the statement said. Smaller hotels often post placards at the service desk displaying the password for Wi-Fi access and change the password infrequently.

The FBI also said that these passwords are sometimes combinations of the room number and password, making it more vulnerable to cyberattacks.

The FBI advised users to use virtual private network (VPN) connections to make it harder for hackers to track activity. Other recommendations include always accessing HTTP secured websites, connecting only to the hotel’s official network, using multi-factor authentication for logging into sensitive accounts, and disabling Bluetooth when not in use.

The lack of a hotel industry standard for secure Wi-Fi connection is also a reminder that guests should not implicitly trust the hotel has a secured connection or that it is actively monitoring for attacks.

One of the major drawbacks of hotel network security include the guest’s lack of control over it. Users generally have minimal visibility into both the physical location of wireless access points within the hotel and the age of networking equipment. Old, outdated equipment is more likely to possess vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit, the statement read.

Even if a hotel is using modern equipment, the guest has no way of knowing how frequently the hotel is updating the firmware of the equipment or whether the hotel has changed the equipment’s default password.

Hotel networks pose special threat to business professionals as cybercriminals use stolen intellectual property data to facilitate their own schemes or to produce counterfeit versions of proprietary products. They can use information gathered to access company data to trick business executives into transferring money to the criminal.

The most common signs to recognise that a device has been hacked include sudden slowing down of mobile device, automatic cursor movement and launching of apps, increase in pop-up advertising and data usage, and faster-than-usual decrease in battery life.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/es6dkw/article32826831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/wifi-reutersjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hotel-wi-fi-networks-favour-guest-convenience-over-strong-security-fbi-warns/article32826821.ece

Epic Games on Wednesday said GMC Hummer EV will be the first car to use Epic Games’ Unreal Engine in its digital cockpit.

Unreal Engine will be used to power Hummer’s infotainment system. This engine is used for Epic’s Unreal Tournament and games such as Fortnite and Psyonix’s Rocket League.

The collaboration is part of Epic Games’ partnership with car makers for its human-machine interface(HMI) initiative to build in-car software.

“We’ll be able to reveal more upon the launch of all-electric HUMMER truck on October 20, 2020,” Epic said in a statement.

The game developer also showed a demo video of how the Unreal Engine’s HMI may look like. However, Epic did not mention which version of the Unreal Engine will be used.

Unreal Engine will enable users to customize the interface elements, and keep a tab on vehicle statistics with 3D and colorful statistics. In addition to this, it provides downloadable content packs for users to rapidly change functionality and content in HMI experience.

Another feature called fast style switching will allow users to change every aspect of the user interface with the press of a button. Epic is also working with HMI technology leaders including Blackberry QNX, Mapbox, and Qualcomm.

The engine’s suite of profiling tools like Unreal Insights can keep applications running smoothly, guaranteeing high-performance and fluid user interactions.

“We’ll be rolling out more HMI-specific features in Unreal Engine in the coming months and throughout 2021,” Epic said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hi89rq/article32826204.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Hummer-EV-Unreal-Enginepng,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hummer-ev-will-run-on-fortnites-unreal-engine/article32826190.ece

35,2020/10/11,Bihar Assembly elections | Nitish Kumar unveils poll promises,"Nadda kicks off campaign in Gaya; BJP announces 46 names for second phase

With the first phase of Assembly elections in Bihar barely two weeks away, JD(U) president and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday reiterated that he would implement the sequel to his ambitious Saat Nishchay (seven resolves) programme to make the State self-reliant.

The BJP which started its poll campaign on Sunday from Gaya, released the list of the party’s 30 star campaigners and 46 candidates for the second phase of the poll.

“Saat Nischay part-2 is in continuation with the earlier set of promises made to the public during the ongoing NDA regime,” Mr. Kumar tweeted on Sunday.

Former ally, Chirag Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party, had taken issue with Mr. Kumar over his flagship programme, saying, “The programme is not of NDA rule but was a carry forward from the mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) government,” of which the JD(U) had been a member.

While speaking to The Hindu in private some BJP leaders voiced discomfort with Mr. Kumar’s announcement on the Saat Nischay part-2 “without taking consent of alliance partners”.

Meanwhile, Mr Kumar’s tweet on Sunday listed the areas of development which will be included in development programme’s sequel.

“Creating a centre of excellence for promoting quality of training in ITI and polytechnic institutions, setting up district wise mega-skill centers for giving job-oriented training, tool rooms and training centers in each division and a new department for skill development and entrepreneurship will also be set up,” said one of the seven resolves of Saat Nischay Part-2.

The CM said the “government will also provide 50% grants, up to a maximum of ₹3 lakh for setting up a new business and on loans of up to ₹7 lakh, grants of 7% will be given by the government.”

Girls completing Class XII exams will be given ₹25,000 each, and ₹50,000 those completing their graduation, Mr. Kumar said and promised to increase the participation of women in local administration, police, and in district-level offices, among others through reservations.

BJP president J.P. Nadda kicked off the party’s campaign from Gaya. While attacking the Congress, he also asserted that as “Nitish Kumar government took care of the people of Bihar amid COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that the leadership of the State is secured with him.”

Addressing a public meeting, Mr. Nadda listed achievements of the NDA governments at the Center and State in the last six years. “Leadership of India is secured in the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and it is also important that the leadership of Bihar is secured with Nitish Kumar,” he said.

The BJP’s list of 30 star campaigners includes PM Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. JD(U) sources told The Hindu that joint campaigns of Mr. Modi and Mr. Kumar would be held but dates have not been fixed yet.

China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a new forum to defuse tensions in the West Asia after a meeting with his Iranian counterpart where he reiterated Beijing’s support for Tehran.

Mr. Wang and Javad Zarif also reaffirmed their commitment to Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, an implicit rebuke of the U.S. for abandoning the accord during their Saturday meeting in China’s southwestern Tengchong city.

Iran has been locked in an acrimonious relationship with Saudi Arabia, the other major West Asian power, over the war in Yemen, Iranian influence in Iraq and Saudi support for Washington’s sanctions on Tehran.

“China proposes to build a regional multilateral dialogue platform with equal participation of all stakeholders,” said the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement.

The forum would “enhance mutual understanding through dialogue and explore political and diplomatic solutions to security issues in the West Asia”, the statement added.

Mr. Wang added that support for the Iranian nuclear deal, negotiated by the Obama administration but ultimately abandoned by Donald Trump, would be a precondition of entry to the forum.

Mr. Zarif said on Twitter his “fruitful talks” with Mr. Wang amounted to a rejection of “U.S. unilateralism” and had also focused on strategic ties and collaboration on the development of a coronavirus vaccine.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xzdud/article32828710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-CHINA-IRAN-DIPLOMACY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-backs-iran-nuclear-deal-calls-for-new-west-asia-forum/article32828711.ece
41,2020/10/11,Sunni cleric shot dead in Pakistan,"Gunmen riding on a motorcycle shot and killed a religious scholar who belongs to a little-known branch of Islam in Pakistan’s bustling city of Karachi, police said on Sunday.

The killing of Maulana Adil Khan was immediately condemned and seen as an attempt to trigger sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shiites in the country.

Mr. Khan is the son of late prominent scholar Maulana Saleemullah Khan, who founded the grand seminary, Jamia Farooqia, decades ago. The seminary adheres to the Sunni Muslim teachings of the Deobandi sect, whose scholars have been the target of killings in the past.

Mr. Khan held a doctorate in religious studies, received training in his father’s seminary and had taught in Malaysia.

Police said the cleric and his driver were both killed in the attack on Saturday evening, which took place in the middle class neighbourhood of Shah Faisal Colony. Police added that when the cleric’s vehicle stopped in front of a busy shopping area, gunmen opened fire targeting the driver before firing three bullets that struck Mr. Khan’s head, neck and chest. The three attackers then fled away.

PM blames India

Prime Minister Imran Khan termed it “an attempt by India to create sectarian conflict across the country,” though no immediate evidence was given that India was behind the attack.

42,2020/10/11,South Korea urges North Korea to stick to its pledges,"It expresses concerns over Pyongyang’s unveiling of long-range ballistic missiles

South Korea on Sunday urged North Korea to commit to its past disarmament pledges while expressing concerns over the North’s unveiling of a suspected new long-range missile during a military parade.

During celebrations marking the 75th birthday of its ruling party in Pyongyang on Saturday, North Korea paraded a variety of weapons systems, including two missiles that were disclosed for the first time to a foreign audience. One is what appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile that is larger than any of the North’s known ICBMs, and the other would likely be an upgraded version of a missile that can be fired from submarines.

While some experts say they could be mock-ups of missiles under development, their disclosures suggest North Korea has been continuously pushing to boost its weapons capability amid a stalemate in nuclear diplomacy with the United States.

South Korea’s Defense Ministry said Sunday it was expressing concerns about the fact that “North Korea unveiled weapons including what was suspected to be a new long-range ballistic missile.” A ministry statement demanded North Korea abide by 2018 inter-Korean deals aimed at lowering animosities.

Defence reassessment

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry issued a separate statement urging North Korea to return to talks to produce progress in its past commitment to achieving denuclearisation and peace on the Korean Peninsula. After an emergency National Security Council meeting, council members in South Korea said they’ll continue to analyse the strategic significance of the North Korean weapons systems disclosed on Saturday and review South Korea’s defence capabilities.

Ties between the Koreas remain strained amid the deadlocked nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington.

The fact that Mr. Kim maintains his self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests indicates he still wants to keep chances for diplomacy with the U.S. alive. But some experts say he’ll eventually carry out a major weapons test after the U.S. presidential election to boost his leverage in potential new negotiations with the U.S., whoever wins the election.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3ctgia/article32828659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-NKOREA-POLITICS-ANNIVERSARY2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-korea-urges-north-korea-to-stick-to-its-pledges/article32828660.ece

44,2020/10/11,China grants $90 mn to Sri Lanka after visit by top official,"It would be used for ‘medical care, education, water supplies’

China announced on Sunday that it was providing a $90 million grant to Sri Lanka, two days after the island nation’s President sought help from a visiting Chinese delegation in disproving a perception that China-funded megaprojects are “debt traps.”

Calling the financial assistance a “timely grant,” the Chinese Embassy in Colombo said that it would be used for medical care, education and water supplies in Sri Lanka’s rural areas. and that it would “contribute to the well-being of (Sri Lankans) in a post-COVID era.” s

The announcement follows a visit to the Indian Ocean island nation on Friday by a Chinese delegation led by Yang Jiechi, a Communist Party Politburo member and a former Foreign Minister.

During talks with Mr. Yang, Sri Lankan President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa asked China to help him in disproving a perception that China-funded megaprojects are “debt traps” aimed at gaining influence in local affairs.

Crucial link

China considers Sri Lanka to be a critical link in its massive “Belt and Road” global infrastructure building initiative and has provided billions of dollars in loans for Sri Lankan projects over the past decade. The projects include a seaport, airport, port-city, highways and power stations.

Critics say that the Chinese-funded projects are not financially viable and that Sri Lanka will face difficulties in repaying the loans.

In 2017, Sri Lanka leased out a Chinese-built port located near busy shipping routes to a Chinese company for 99 years to recover from the heavy burden of repaying the Chinese loan the country received to build it.

The facility is part of Beijing’s plan for a line of ports stretching from Chinese waters to the Persian Gulf. China has also agreed to provide a $989 million loan to Sri Lanka to build an expressway that will connect its tea-growing central region to the Chinese-run seaport.

Counting was under way in Tajikistan on Sunday in a presidential election expected to pave the way for incumbent Emomali Rakhmon to become the longest-ruling strongman in the former Soviet region.

Few are anticipating any hiccups for Mr. Rakhmon as he closes in on three decades in power and looks to overtake Kazakhstan’s recently retired Nursultan Nazarbayev.

The Central Electoral Commission said the vote had passed the turnout threshold required for validation, with more than 70% of the nearly five million strong electorate casting votes.

Statements of turnouts are a feature of elections in this part of the world however, and are impossible to verify.

Authoritarian Rakhmon faces four other candidates, all viewed as token opponents, in his bid for a fresh seven-year term. Results are expected on Monday.

Zarina Mamadnazarova, a 25-year-old woman who is unemployed, said she would vote for Mr. Rakhmon “because he is the best President, our national leader”.

Mr. Rakhmon is portrayed by state media as bringing stability to the country following a civil war during the 1990s that pitted government forces against a diverse opposition including Islamist fighters.

President Donald Trump is no longer contagious, nine days after being stopped in his tracks by COVID-19, his physician said in a statement released late on Saturday.

“I am happy to report that in addition to the President meeting CDC criteria for the safe discontinuation of isolation, this morning’s COVID PCR sample demonstrates, by currently recognised standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,” Sean Conley said in the statement

Dr. Conley, who has been accused of a lack of transparency with the public, said it had been 10 days since Mr. Trump first began showing symptoms of the coronavirus.

Tests showed there was “no longer evidence of actively replicating virus,” and that Mr. Trump’s viral load was “decreasing,” Dr. Conley continued — though he did not state that the President is now virus-free.

Dr. Conley said Mr. Trump is fever-free and symptoms have “improved,” adding that he would continue to monitor the President as he “returns to an active schedule.”

47,2020/10/11,Mexican president asks Pope Francis for conquest apology,"He asked the Pope to make a statement in favour of Miguel Hidalgo, Mexico’s 19th-century independence leader.

Mexico’s president published an open letter to Pope Francis calling on the Roman Catholic Church to apologise for abuses of Indigenous peoples during the conquest of Mexico in the 1500s.

In the letter published on Saturday, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador also asks the Pope to lend Mexico ancient pre-Hispanic Mexican or colonial-era documents.

“The Catholic Church, the Spanish monarchy and the Mexican government should make a public apology for the offensive atrocities that Indigenous people suffered,” the letter states.

Mr. Lopez Obrador asked the Pope to make a statement in favour of Miguel Hidalgo, Mexico’s 19th-century independence leader who was once believed to have been excommunicated by the church for his involvement in the uprising.

However, researchers later said it appeared that Hidalgo had confessed his sins before he was executed and thus was not excommunicated.

Mr. Lopez Obrador said: “I think it would be an act of humility and at the same time greatness for the church to reconcile posthumously with Hidalgo.”

The letter comes as Mexico struggles with how to mark the 500th anniversary of the 1519-1521 conquest, which resulted in the death of a large part of the country’s pre-Hispanic population.

In 2019, Mr. Lopez Obrador asked Spain for an apology for the conquest, in which millions of Indigenous people died from violence and disease.

The bomb was found by a fisherman on Elizabeth Reef near Lord Howe Island, about 550 kilometers off New South Wales state. He photographed his discovery and reported it to authorities.

Divers aboard the HMAS Adelaide carefully removed the abandoned explosive by floating it to the surface and towing it farther out to sea where it was dropped into 550-meter deep waters.

“That depth is really safe. It’s not going to ever get washed back up onto the reef,” Senior Marine Parks Officer John Pritchard said.

There’s no deep-sea fishing or trawling allowed out there. It’s a recreational fishing zone only. The chances of that UXO (unexploded ordinance) ever coming back to the surface is negligible.

The origin of the bomb is not known and divers couldn’t estimate its age because of its deterioration, a spokesperson for Environment Minister Sussan Ley said.

Bombs of that size were used as long ago as World War I, sometimes dropped from aircraft to target submarines. There were also bombings off the Australian east coast during World War II.

Ms. Ley said the fisherman and navy divers had potentially saved lives and one of Australia’s most important reefs.

The device was regarded as live by the navy and the consequences could have been quite frightening, Ms. Ley said in a statement on Sunday. “Thankfully the reef’s precious ecosystem is safe and most importantly so are future visitors.”

Elizabeth Reef is about 160 kilometers north of World Heritage-listed Lord Howe Island. Along with nearby Middleton Reef, Mr. Pritchard said it is the southernmost coral reef platform in the world.

There’s been 125 corals identified there and over 300 species of fish, Mr. Pritchard said. It’s quite a unique environment and, because it’s so far from anywhere, it’s relatively untouched.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qyhhzy/article32826197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKAUSTRALIAUNEXPLODEDBOMB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australian-navy-ship-tows-unexploded-45-kg-bomb-out-to-sea/article32826198.ece
51,2020/10/11,"Donald Trump is no longer a COVID-19 ‘transmission risk,’ says White House doctor","The statement follows Mr. Trump’s first public appearance since returning to the White House after being treated for the coronavirus.

President Donald Trump’s doctor said on Saturday the President is no longer at risk of transmitting the coronavirus.

In a memo, Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley says Mr. Trump meets the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for safely discontinuing isolation and that by “currently recognised standards” he is no longer considered a transmission risk.

The memo follows Mr. Trump’s first public appearance since returning to the White House after being treated for the coronavirus. Hundreds of people gathered on Saturday afternoon on the South Lawn for a Trump address on his support for law enforcement from a White House balcony.

Mr. Trump took off a mask moments after he emerged on the balcony to address the crowd on the lawn below, his first step back onto the public stage with just more than three weeks to go until Election Day. He flouted, once more, the safety recommendations of his own government just days after acknowledging that he was on the brink of “bad things” from the virus and claiming that his bout with the illness brought him a better understanding of it.

Though billed as an official event, Mr. Trump offered no policy proposals and instead delivered the usual attacks on Democrat Joe Biden while praising law enforcement to a crowd of several hundred, most of whom wore masks while few adhered to social distancing guidelines.

“I’m feeling great,” said Mr. Trump, who said he was thankful for their good wishes and prayers as he recovered. He then declared that the pandemic, which has killed more than 2,10,000 Americans, was “disappearing” even though he is still recovering from the virus.

The officials organised the crowd just steps from the Rose Garden, where exactly two weeks ago the president held another large gathering to formally announce his nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. That event is now being eyed as a possible COVID-19 superspreader as more than two dozen people in attendance have contracted the virus.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4ogk86/article32825862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-ELECTIONTRUMPTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-is-no-longer-a-covid-19-transmission-risk-says-white-house-doctor/article32825839.ece
52,2020/10/11,"Trump, Trudeau discuss issue of two Canadian citizens detained in China","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed on October 10 the issue of two Canadian citizens who have been detained in China, Mr. Trudeau's office said in a read out statement of the phone call between the two leaders.

Mr. Trudeau thanked Mr. Trump for the United States' support in “seeking the immediate release of the two Canadian citizens arbitrarily detained by China”, the statement read, without giving more details.

The White House had no immediate comment on further details about the call.

China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, in late 2018 and later charged them with espionage, after Canada had arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies , on a U.S. warrant.

The relations between Canada and China have since been tense.

The United States' own tensions with China have also increased recently over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, the ongoing trade war between the two countries, China's imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong and the subsequent end to Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law by Mr. Trump.

53,2020/10/11,"Pull investments from companies not committed to environment, pope says","Pope Francis on October 10 urged people to pull investments from companies that are not committed to protecting the environment, adding his voice to calls for the economic model that emerges from the coronavirus pandemic to be a sustainable one.

Pope Francis spoke in a video message for an online event called “Countdown Global Launch, A Call to Action on Climate Change”.

“Science tells us, every day with more precision, that we need to act urgently... if we are to have any hope of avoiding radical and catastrophic climate change,” he said.

The pope listed three action points: better education about the environment, sustainable agriculture and access to clean water, and a transition away from fossil fuels.

“One way to encourage this change is to lead companies towards the urgent need to commit to the integral care of our common home, excluding from investments companies that do not meet [these] parameters ... and rewarding those that [do],” he said.

He said the pandemic had made the need to address the climate crisis and related social problems even more pressing.

“The current economic system is unsustainable. We are faced with a moral imperative... to rethink many things,” he said, listing means of production, consumerism, waste, indifference to the poor, and harmful energy sources.

In June, a Vatican document urged Catholics to disinvest from the armaments and fossil fuel industries and to monitor companies in sectors such as mining for possible damage to the environment.

Other speakers and activists at the online event included actress Jane Fonda, Britain’s Prince William, former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gol53q/article32825056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-POPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pull-investments-from-companies-not-committed-to-environment-pope-says/article32825057.ece

An ultra-light airplane collided on October 10 with another small plane, killing five people as the two aircraft fell into gardens around a small town in France.

The collision occurred in the skies above Loches, about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Tours, southeast of Paris, according to the Mayor, Marc Angenault, who was quoted by the France Bleu radio station.

According to Nadia Seghier, head of the prefecture, the state authority of the Indre-et-Loire region, the ultra-light plane fell around a home near the town’s centre without injuring people on the ground. The tourism aircraft, reportedly a four-seat single engine plane, fell into an uninhabited sector.

Two of the dead were in the ultra-light plane and the three others in the other small aircraft. There were no reports of survivors.

55,2020/10/11,Judge throws out Trump campaign’s Pennsylvania lawsuit,"The ruling by U.S. District Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan — who was appointed by Mr. Trump — in Pittsburgh also poured cold water on Mr. Trump’s claims that election fraud will work against him.

Trump’s campaign said it would appeal at least one element of the decision, with barely three weeks to go until Election Day in a state hotly contested by Mr. Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

The lawsuit was opposed by the administration of Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, the state Democratic Party, the League of Women Voters, the NAACP’s Pennsylvania office and other allied groups.

“The ruling is a complete rejection of the continued misinformation about voter fraud and corruption, and those who seek to sow chaos and discord ahead of the upcoming election,” Mr. Wolf’s office said in a statement.

The state’s Attorney General, Josh Shapiro, a Democrat whose office fought the Mr. Trump campaign’s claims, called the lawsuit a political stunt designed to sow doubt in the state’s election.

“We told the Trump campaign and the president, ‘put up or shut up’ to his claims of voter fraud in Pennsylvania,” Mr. Shapiro told. “It’s important to note they didn’t even need to prove actual voter fraud, just that it was likely or impending, and they couldn’t even do that.”

Trump’s campaign said in a statement that it looked forward to a quick decision from the appeals court “that will further protect Pennsylvania voters from the Democrats’ radical voting system.”

The lawsuit is one of many partisan battles being fought in the state Legislature and the courts, primarily over mail-in voting in Pennsylvania, amid concerns that a presidential election result will hang in limbo for days on a drawn-out vote count in Pennsylvania.

In this case, Trump’s campaign wanted the court to bar counties from using drop boxes or mobile sites to collect mail-in ballots that are not “staffed, secured, and employed consistently within and across all 67 of Pennsylvania’s counties.” Trump’s campaign said it would appeal the matter of drop boxes.

More than 20 counties — including Philadelphia and most other heavily populated Democratic-leaning counties — have told the state elections office that they plan to use drop boxes and satellite election offices to help collect the massive number of mail-in ballots they expect to receive.

Trump’s campaign also wanted the court to free county election officials to disqualify mail-in ballots where the voter’s signature may not match their signature on file and to remove a county residency requirement in state law for certified poll watchers.

In guidance last month, Wolf’s top elections official told counties that state law does not require or permit them to reject a mail—in ballot solely over a perceived signature inconsistency. Trump’s campaign had asked Mr. Ranjan to declare that guidance unconstitutional and to block counties from following it.

In throwing out the case, Mr. Ranjan wrote that the Trump campaign could not prove their central claim — that Mr. Trump’s fortunes in the Nov. 3 election in Pennsylvania are threatened by election fraud and that adopting changes sought by the campaign will fix that.

Mr. Ranjan wrote Trump’s campaign could not prove that the President has been hurt by election fraud or even that he is likely to be hurt by fraud.

“While plaintiffs may not need to prove actual voter fraud, they must at least prove that such fraud is ‘certainly impending,’” Mr. Ranjan wrote. “They haven’t met that burden. At most, they have pieced together a sequence of uncertain assumptions.”

Mr. Ranjan also cited decisions in recent days by the U.S. Supreme Court and the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in hot-button election cases, saying he should not second-guess reasonable decisions by state lawmakers and election officials.

The decision comes as Mr. Trump claims he can only lose the state if Democrats cheat and, as he did in 2016 campaign, suggests that the Democratic bastion of Philadelphia needs to be watched closely for election fraud.

On Friday, Trump’s campaign lost a bid in a Philadelphia court to force the city to allow campaign representatives to monitor its satellite election offices.

U.S. President Donald Trump on October 10 made his first public address after being discharged from hospital where he was treated for COVID-19 infection, assuring his supporters that he felt great.

Hundreds of Republican supporters sporting light blue t-shirts and the familiar red MAGA (Make America Great Again) caps gathered at the South Lawns of the White House as the President addressed them from his balcony in a campaign-style event.

“I am feeling great. This is the single most important election in the history of our country. Get out and vote, and I love you,” Mr. Trump told his supporters, looking healthy and energetic.

Mr. Trump, 74, and First Lady Melania, 50, tested positive for COVID-19 last week. The President was taken to a military hospital for treatment. After spending four days there, he came back to the White House on Monday.

“We got a great poll in Florida. We got a great poll in North Carolina. We got a great poll in Nevada. Georgia is looking fantastic. Texas is looking fantastic. We got a great poll in Texas and great polls all over the place,” he said in his first public address since returning from hospital.

Mr. Trump mocked Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as left wing politicians.

“Our opponents will crush the comeback [from COVID-19] with unscientific lockdowns,” he said.

“We have a level of support the likes of which nobody has ever seen,” Mr. Trump boasted, as he launched into a riff on ballot fraud.

“I think we’re going to swamp them by so much it’s not going to matter,” he told his supporters, who frequently broke into chants of “four more years”, “we love you!, we love you”.

The White House described the address as an official event where the President delivered remarks to peaceful protesters in support of law and order.

Since taking office, Mr. Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to restoring law and order in the country while working with state and local law enforcement to protect communities and the rights of all Americans, the White House said.

In his address, Mr. Trump highlighted his administration’s monumental achievements for communities of colour, including record employment, historic low poverty rates, criminal justice reform, billions of investment through opportunity zones, and unwavering support to school of choice.

Under Mr. Trump’s leadership, ‘the American dream’ is being restored for citizens all across our great nation and the forgotten men and women of America are no longer forgotten, it said.

Thanking his supporters for the prayers and the well wishes they offered to him and the First Lady this past week, Mr. Trump said through the power of American science and medicine they will eradicate the ‘China Virus’ once and for all.

“Everyone here this afternoon is part of a growing nationwide movement called BLEXIT. Black and Latino Americans are rejecting the radical socialist left and they are embracing our pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-police, and pro-American agenda. You understand that to protect the lives of Black Americans, and all Americans, we must support our police,” he said.

Critical of Mr. Biden, the President said if the left gains power, they will launch a nationwide crusade against law enforcement taking away their funds, their firearms, and their fundamental authorities.

It is time for all Americans to stand up and reject the campaign of slander against our police from left-wing politicians and liberal pundits, he said.

Mr. Trump asserted that where there is evidence of wrongdoing by police, the criminal justice system must investigate and any perpetrators must be held accountable.

But we must never allow mob rule, he said. No one is hurt more by the left-wing war on cops than African-Americans. Last year, in just four Democrat-run cities, over 1,000 African-Americans were murdered as a result of violent crimes. And the riots, looting, and arson disproportionately hurt Black and Latino communities, he said.

Referring to his recently launched ‘Platinum Plan’, Mr. Trump said it envisions 3 million new jobs for black Americans, increased access to capital by $500 billion dollars, and advanced home ownership and wealth building over the next four years.

“We will build up peaceful and safer neighbourhoods with the highest standards of policing. We will create a healthcare system that delivers better care at lower cost, addressing chronic health disparities. And we will deliver school choice to every parent in America,” he said.

“We will support our police, we will restore safety to our streets, we will return our economy to full prosperity, and next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country!” said the President.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qu9xpp/article32823948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/appearing-at-white-house-donald-trump-holds-first-public-event-since-covid-19-diagnosis/article32823949.ece

59,2020/10/11,Andhra CM Jagan Mohan Reddy complains to CJI against Supreme Court judge,"Says recent High Court judgments benefited the TDP

In an unprecedented move, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has urged Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde to ensure that the State’s judicial neutrality is maintained.

In a letter addressed to Chief Justice Bobde, Mr. Jagan alleged that Supreme Court judge Justice N.V. Ramana had been influencing the sittings of the High Court, including the roster of a few judges and cited instances of how matters important to the opposition Telugu Desam Party had been ‘allocated to a few judges’, along with copies of orders passed in a few matters.

He cited the recent order passed by the Chief Justice of the High Court in a writ petition No. 16468 of 2020 filed by former Advocate-General Dammalapati Srinivas, staying investigation in the FIR lodged against Mr. Srinivas and a gag order on the press, against which an SLP was preferred.

“While the Supreme Court of India has been steadfast in ensuring no prior restraint on publication by media, a gag order on the media is passed in the above WP. Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu passed an interim order on October 16, the very next day of the gag order, staying all further proceedings arising from the Cabinet sub committee report, even after being apprised that the matter is before the Union of India,” Mr. Jagan said.

Stating that the beneficiaries of both the judgments of the High Court were clearly the politicians of the TDP, Mr. Jagan said that Justice Ramana was a legal adviser and additional advocate-general in the previous government of the TDP.

The Chief Minister said that the State government formed a sub-committee by GO no. 1411 on June 26, 2019, to examine the allegations of unbridled corruption, ruthless exploitation of natural resources, grabbing of lands from small and marginal farmers.

After the sub-committee submitted its findings, referring to the amassing of wealth by TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu and others by adopting various illegal means to the Assembly, the government forwarded the report to the Union of India urging for a CBI inquiry.

In view of the above, the Chief Minister urged the Chief Justice of India to consider initiating steps to ensure that the State’s judicial neutrality was maintained.

Adviser to the Chief Minister Ajeya Kallam told reporters on Saturday night that the State government had submitted all evidences to the Chief Justice of India pertaining to “interference by a sitting Supreme Court judge in matters dealt by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh”.

“In larger public interest and in order to put to rest the speculations in a section of media concerning these developments, the government deemed it fit to officially speak on the above to ensure the dignity of all the institutions of the State is preserved. The Government of Andhra Pradesh filed Special Leave Petitions against the orders of Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu of the High Court staying all further proceedings of Cabinet Sub-Committee and the order of Chief Justice Jitendra Kumar Maheswari staying investigation and a gag order on the reportage of FIR filed against a former A-G and family members of a sitting SC judge in what is now being referred by Amaravati Land Scam. The government has apprised the recent happenings in the High Court and in particular reference to the intervention of a sitting Supreme Court judge, Justice N.V. Ramana, in the proceedings of the High Court,’’ said Mr. Kallam.

Mr. Kallam said that the State government placed all the evidences along with a covering letter written by the Chief Minister to the Chief Justice of India on October 8.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-assembly/wup3rj/article32825110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJJAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-assembly/jagan-complains-to-cji-against-supreme-court-judge/article32825111.ece

The story so far:Maya’s Nana responds to her Facebook request, but Konica suspects it might be a fake person. So, they decide to investigate further.

“Not so fast, Maya,” Konica interrupted. “Let’s first confirm this. How do you find a ghost?”

“We can only connect with those people who had a Facebook account when they were alive,” explained Maya.

But just then, Maya’s mother called her home. So, they decided to chat with Nana the next day.

“Mummy,” said Maya, as she sat down for breakfast the next day. “Can I go play with Rocky?”

“Why do you suddenly want to chat with Nana?” asked the mother.

“I miss Nana. He was the only person who talked to me. You’re always busy, even when you’re home. Papa’s always on tour. Rocky is so silly,” rued Maya.

“Every child is doing something, so they don’t get bored,” her mother said. “How about joining a computer class? You like computers.”

“Yes, but I already know everything about computers.” If she could figure out how to connect with a ghost through Facebook, she was way ahead of the regular kids.

“There is always something new to discover.”

Maya shrugged. “I don’t mind sharing my knowledge with others. Now can I go play?”

He mother nodded and Maya ran off to Rocky’s house.

Testing the ghost

Konica handed Maya her mobile. “I tried to find some of our relatives, but it appears none of them had a Facebook account.”

“I’m sure Nana can see me,” said Maya.

“How?” asked Konica.

“He knows mummy wants to enrol me in computer classes,” Maya showed them his message: Computer classes are fun. “And, he typed it just now. Nana’s online.”

“Can he see us?” asked Rocky.

“Let’s find out.” Maya typed, ‘Nana, what colour dress am I wearing?’

‘Yellow. My sunshine.’Konica’s face glowed. “Please ask Nana if he can get me Ranbir Kapoor’s mobile number.”

“What?” Maya frowned. “A dodo feather would be more up Nana’s alley.”

“Ask!” screamed Konica, “Or, I’ll take my phone away.”

Maya typed. There was no reply.

“Nana is slow. I used to help Nana with typing,” said Maya.

‘We do not have a telephone directory here in heaven.’

“I think it’s all a hoax!” Konica muttered.

“My Nana’s not a hoax!” Maya’s eyes became slits. “He’s a real ghost!”

Konica snatched her mobile from Maya and typed, ‘If you really are Maya’s Nana, come and meet us.’

61,2020/10/11,Say cheese!,"We’re starting a new column on modern history: origin stories of everyday things that you see around you. This week, we look at an invention that has been reborn several times over the years...

Once upon a time — actually not very long ago — the only way to take a selfie was to use the self-timer on cameras. This was mostly used for group photos and often gave hilarious and awkward memories.

About a decade ago, the selfie stick emerged to become so popular and annoying that it has been banned from many public venues. The selfie stick may seem like a relatively new invention, but it has actually had many avatars for over hundred years!

The first selfie stick could be described as the hands of talented artists who, using a reflection of themselves in a mirror, painted self-portraits. The famous artist Van Gogh was quite obsessed and painted close to 35 portraits of himself.

Ingenuity

The selfie stick in its rod-like form dates back close to 100 years. A journalist, Alan Cleaver, shared a photo of his grandparents taken when his grandfather mounted the camera at the end of a pole and somehow activated the self-timer function to take a post-wedding photo. The pole is visible in his image and serves as evidence.

The selfie stick was further re-invented at least two times more, due to problems experienced on a European family holiday. The idea came to Ueda, a Japanese engineer at Minolta, after a child he had asked to take a photo ran away with his camera. Ueda, working with his colleague Mima, created the “telescopic extender for supporting compact camera”, a patent for which was filed in 1984. The “extender stick” held a camera in place with a screw and also featured a mirror that people used to make sure they looked all right, before snapping the photo.

Unaware of the Japanese work, Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm came up with the Quik Pod in 2005. The idea took root when Fromm couldn’t find someone who spoke English to request to take a picture with his family while on holiday in Europe.

While Ueda still uses his invention, it never took off commercially. He describes it as a “3.00 a.m. invention”, one which arrived too early. But Fromm has sold his invention in the millions.

The next time you see a selfie stick, you can remind yourself that it is one of the few modern inventions to have been reinvented many times over!",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/pgr2ge/article32826374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SELFIE-221,https://www.thehindu.com/children/say-cheese/article32826376.ece
62,2020/10/11,The first crewed Apollo mission,"On October 11, 1968, Apollo 7 – the first crewed Apollo mission – was launched. An engineering success, the mission was the first to successfully demonstrate command and service module with crew performance and also included the first American live broadcast from space. It wasn’t all rosy, however, as it also featured a mini mutiny in space, probably a first for NASA.

The word Apollo comes from the ancient stories and mythology of the Greeks, and corresponds to a god who is connected to many things, including but not limited to music, poetry, medicine and the sun. For most of us, however, the word is synonymous with the Apollo missions, which successfully landed the first human beings on the moon.

While the Apollo 11 mission and its crew of Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins are the most popular among them, most other Apollo missions also receive their due. One among them, Apollo 7, was the first Apollo mission with a human crew on board that went into space.

After a cabin fire had killed the crew of Apollo 1, NASA had not sent astronauts to space for nearly two years. They listened to their astronauts and enhanced the safety measures. Even though the unmanned Apollo missions 4, 5 and 6 (no missions or flights were designated 2 or 3) proved to be a success and proved the hardware was safe enough in space by itself, the stakes were high for Apollo 7.

Wally, Walter and Donn

The three member crew of Apollo 7 was commanded by Wally Schirra, who became the only astronaut to fly in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programmes. Schirra was accompanied by two spaceflight novices, Walter Cunningham and Donn Eisele.

The spacecraft was launched on October 11, 1968 and entered orbit smoothly thereafter. After completing a couple of Earth orbits, Schirra turned the command module and simulated a docking with the third stage of the Saturn IB rocket. This manoeuvre was important as it proved to be a test for future dockings between the command and lunar modules of spacecraft.

Flintstones connect

The engine of the command module was next tested on multiple occasions as this engine was tasked with taking crews to the moon, slowing down while entering lunar orbit, speeding up to exit lunar orbit and also for the safe re-entry to Earth. The crew turned it on and off eight times and NASA termed them as perfect firings.

The crew, however, weren’t sure exactly what to expect on the first occasion when they did fire the engine. Startled while feeling the vibration produced by the powerful jolt given to the spacecraft while starting the engine, Schirra yelled “Yabba Dabba Doo!” – the catchphrase of a popular cartoon character Fred Flintsone from The Flintstones.

The mission achieved a lot of things that it set out to do, including the first live television broadcast from a manned spacecraft in space. It also exposed some of the engineering defects that could be rectified for the upcoming missions. The windows fogged, making visibility a problem for the astronauts, and there were also minor issues pertaining to the electrical and fuel systems. These were noted down, to be sorted for the future. And then, there were the mini mutinies from the space crew during their 11 days in space.

Mucus problem

The Apollo spacecraft was much more spacious than its predecessors, but it certainly wasn’t home. Space food is never a treat and even though the solid waste management system was adequate, it was annoying to say the least. To add to it, the crew members became sick as well.

Just 15 hours into the flight, Schirra came down with a severe head cold. The close confines meant the rest of the crew soon shared this fate of his. While you might think what the big deal is with a head cold, you must remember that this is happening in space. Annoying here on Earth itself, a cold is worse in space as the microgravity environment means that the mucus can’t be drained easily from the head. The crew members made their position clear on a number of occasions, available now in recorded conversations.

The biggest issue, however, came near the end of the mission. The crew decided not to wear the helmets, which had no visor openings, as they were concerned about the pressure of re-entry hurting their ears and wanting to have the chance of blowing their noses to relieve pressure if required. Even though ground control wasn’t happy about this, they went ahead with it, and arrived just fine.

It is worth mentioning that none of the three crew members ever flew again in space. Their move, however, got NASA thinking about the psychological aspects faced by astronauts during their time in space. Improved medicine, flexibility with respect to the work expected and other minor perks to keep crew members happy these days are all possibly a fallout of Apollo 7’s crew members making their displeasure felt.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/evwno5/article32758057.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11istbapollo7crewjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/the-first-crewed-apollo-mission/article32758058.ece
63,2020/10/11,EWS quota: Jipmer increases MBBS intake,"Number of seats raised from 200 to 249; institute scraps separate entrance test in view of NEET

The Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Education and Medical Research (Jipmer) has increased the number of its MBBS seats for 2020-21 academic session on its main campus in Puducherry and at its Karaikal facility following the implementation of the reservation for the economically weaker sections (EWS).

Jipmer had 200 MBBS seats — 150 seats in Puducherry and 50 in Karaikal campus — the aggregate seats available across all quota categories has now been increased with the approval of competent authorities to 249 — a net increase of 49 seats.

The aggregate MBBS seats is now 187 in Puducherry (an increase of 37 seats) and 62 in Karaikal (an increase of 12 seats).

“The increase is across the board for various categories with the statutory reservation for Economically Weaker Sections,” Pankaj Kundra, Dean (Academic), Jipmer, said. The 10% EWS quota has been introduced in compliance with the Centre’s policy of complementing the seats already reserved for the Scheduled Castes (15%), the Scheduled Tribes (7.5%) and the OBCs (27%). “The additional seats have been established after a proportionate strengthening of facilities in both the campuses,” Jipmer spokesman and additional professor N.G. Rajesh said.

There was a certain gestation time before an order of this magnitude was implemented. Since these were notified by the Centre, there was one year window for improve the facilities to a matching level, officials said.

Local candidates

A change was reflected in the seats reserved for students who were Puducherry natives with 48 seats earmarked in this section under various categories. The quota of seats is 22 (21+1 for Persons with Benchmark Disability) in the unreserved segment, four in the EWS, 12 in the OBC (11+one PwBD), seven in the SC and three in the ST categories.

Jipmer has implemented 5% horizontal reservation for PwBD candidates as per the Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, while provisioning eight out of the 187 seats on its Puducherry campus.

According to the revised matrix in a recently released prospectus, two seats for PwBD has been added to the unreserved seat quota at Jipmer Puducherry resulting in 57 seats (55+2) in this category.

The EWS quota is 13 seats (12 + one for PwBD) while an additional seat each under PwBD quota had been provided for OBC (36 - 35+1), SC (19 - 18+1) and ST (9 - 8+1). The NRI/OCI quota remains unchanged at five seats. For Puducherry residents, the seats under P-UR category aggregate 22 (21+1 PwBD), P-EWS 4, P-OBC 12 (11+one PwBD), P-ST 3 and P-SC 7.

Under the seat matrix for the 62 seats at Jipmer Karaikal, the UR quota is 20 (19+1 PwBD), EWS 4, OBC 12, SC 6 (5+1 PwBD) and ST 3.

The NRI/OCI quota has one seat while the distribution of other seats is P-UR 9, P-EWSs 1, P-OBC 3, P-SC 2, P-ST 1.

Admission counselling

Meanwhile, Jipmer has announced that it would no longer be conducting its flagship MBBS entrance test from this year after the Centre mandated National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) as a single medical entrance exam for UG courses in the country, including for admission to Jipmer and AIIMS.

The Dean (Academic) said admissions to MBBS in Jipmer would be based on NEET score from the 2020 academic session.

The counselling would be done only through the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC), Directorate General of Health Services, Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and not by Jipmer, Puducherry, the Dean said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/9rfdiu/article32829255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THJIPMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ews-quota-jipmer-increases-mbbs-intake/article32829256.ece

The public had lined up right from 9 a.m. after the restaurant announced that the offer would only be available for the first 100 customers.

K. M. S. Hakkim Biryani, the restaurant, announced the celebration of World Biryani Day for the first time in the city by selling biryani at 10 paise per plate for the public and ₹ 1 for frontline COVID-19 volunteers.

“We decided to initiate this offer to thank the public for their patronage and to celebrate the dish that made us popular in the city,” said K. M. S. Mydeen, Proprietor.

While over 1,500 people thronged the shop in Thillai Nagar, only 100 were served with the special offer. At the Palakkarai branch, frontline workers were invited to eat at the chain’s popular biryani at a cost of ₹ 1. “ We did not expect the crowd, and were disappointed to turn away so many customers. We intend to increase the numbers next year,” Mr. Mydeen said.

However, some said that the public neglected COVID safety norms while lining up for the biryani. “There were no social distancing norms being maintained, and there was no way to control the crowd,” a resident of Thillai Nagar said.

While the advertisement for the event had been released two days ago, the civic body and the district administration could have taken action to control it, another resident said. “COVID-19 virus is still spreading.

74,2020/10/11,Construction of shopping complex to begin soon,"Tiruchi Corporation brings old fish market at Puthur under its control

TIRUCHI

After a prolonged legal battle and more than a year after floating the tender, the Tiruchi City Corporation has finally brought the old fish market at Puthur under its control, and razed down all shops so as to construct a commercial complex.

The Puthur market was originally established to accommodate vegetable traders. However, a portion of the market was allocated to wholesale and retail fish traders after the closure of a private market at Bheema Nagar about 25 years ago.

Though the market became an instant hit thanks to its prime location, the unhygienic surroundings and emanating stench had led to protests from the residents. Acknowledging the plight of the residents, the Corporation constructed a new market for fish traders at Kasivilangi on the outskirts of the city and decided to build a commercial complex at the Puthur market. The civic body floated the tender in August last year and completed the process three months later.

Though the civic body managed to shift the vegetable traders to a Woraiyur market in June, it could not vacate the fish traders as a section of traders filed cases in the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court seeking allocation of shops to them in the new market. The civic body successfully fought the cases recently. Still, the officials had to hold a number of meetings to convince the traders as some of them who were not sure of getting new shops at the new market, were not in a mood to budge.

At one point of time, the officials warned that if they failed to vacate their shops by Friday, no truck carrying fish from landing centres would be permitted from Saturday. Only after this warning, the traders relented and moved to the new market.

A senior official told The Hindu that all hurdles for constructing a commercial complex at the old market at Puthur had been removed. Though the preliminary work had begun in August, actual civil work would begin in a few days.

The new complex would have a built up area of about 10,250 sq.mt. It would have ground plus three floors. A sum of ₹ 20.20 crore had been allotted for the project. Construction of a parking lot in the basement with a capacity to accommodate 50 cars and 125 two-wheelers is also part of the project.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/sxw06/article32827340.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY12FISHMARKETTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/construction-of-shopping-complex-to-begin-soon/article32827341.ece

Vijayabaskar said on Sunday. The number of those cured of the viral infection in the State has risen to 92 %, the Minister further said.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Vijayabaskar said intensive measures taken by the State government to curb the spread of the viral infection had resulted in bringing down the COVID-19 positivity rate within 10 % in all districts. Instructions had been given to micro, small and large industrial units to carry out COVID-19 tests on their labourers between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. in the respective units, the Minister said adding that medical camps had been started during night hours at Chennai. Fever camps were being conducted continuously in all the districts to detect COVID-19 cases.

Stating that the COVID-19 vaccine trials were currently under way without causing any side-effects, Mr. Vijayabaskar appealed to the general public to compulsorily wear a mask while venturing out and adhering to the safety measures as advocated by the State government.

He said treatment had been provided to 5.97 lakh persons in the State affected by the viral infection so far.

80,2020/10/11,"Concept of ‘three capitals’ thwarts sub-nationalism, makes economic sense, says Ajeya Kallam","Decentralisation was accepted by multiple committees, he said.

The concept of 'three capitals' is meant to thwart sub-nationalism in the future and build cities that make economic sense. It is backed by evidence of failed attempts to transform urban agglomerations into thriving cities at great costs, principal advisor to CM, Ajeya Kallam said.

Addressing a webinar on 'Decentralisation of three capitals' organised by YSR Congress Party Legal Cell on Sunday, Mr. Kallam said that Navi Mumbai, and a city in the Middle East, are the only two among 32 mega cities in the world that have flourished in the modern era due to their natural advantages.

Instead of pouring all resources into Amaravati, the government decided to decentralise capital functions, which was a model accepted by a plethora of committees right from the ones headed by Supreme Court former judge B.N. Srikrishna and ex-bureaucrat K.C. Sivaramakrishnan, observed principal advisor to CM, Ajeya Kallam.

The cost of construction of new buildings and creating related infrastructure in Visakhapatnam, which was planned to be shaped as the 'executive capital', was estimated to be a maximum of ₹5,000 crore, Mr. Kallam said.

The judicial capital (Kurnool) would require not more ₹1,000 crore, whereas Amaravati would gobble up ₹1,00,000 crore if the TDP Government's model was taken forward by its successor amidst a deep financial crisis.

There is abundant government land in Visakhapatnam and Kurnool, which brings down the land cost drastically.

As far as the 'legislative capital' (Amaravati) was concerned, it has been resolved to reduce the scale of projects in a manner that is proportionate to the actual requirement in accordance with the public works and finance codes.

Many projects in Amaravati had no financial closure as the then government acted as per its whims and fancies.

A study by a German think-tank proved that the cost of public services would be optimal only in cities having a population of less than a million.

Taking into account a whole lot of such technical and economic factors, the government conceived three capitals. It has done its homework and no expert in urban planning voted for what Mr. Sivaramakrishnan described as 'honeypot' model, Mr. Kallam added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/uc6yta/article29562739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30VJRAPAJEYAKAGC06H12TB3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/three-capitals-thwarts-sub-nationalism-makes-economic-sense-says-ajeya-kallam/article32826807.ece

A collection of poems by revolutionary activist-poet Varavara Rao, giving a peek into his political beliefs and assertion of the primacy of people’s rights, will be translated into English, announced publishing house Penguin Random House on Saturday.

Titled “Varavara Rao: India’s Revolutionary Poet”, the book edited by N. Venugopal and Meena Kandasamy, will be published under Penguin’s ‘Vintage imprint’ next year, they added.

One of India’s foremost revolutionary poets, Rao, who is presently incarcerated for the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, has picked about “two-thirds of the poems” to-be featured in the book himself before the arrest.

Also read: How Varavara Rao’s poetry captured and ignited the public imagination

“This is like fulfilment of a long-cherished dream, as making Varavara Rao’s work accessible to English readers has been my dream for decades. As a person who has closely watched the making of his poems, as one of the first readers in manuscript form, I believe his poetry is an expression of his complete personality that blended social history, alternative people’s politics, people’s right to self- determination and unceasing urge for freedom,” said Venugopal, co-editor and nephew of the poet.

Rao, 79, has authored 13 collections of poetry and 16 books of prose — including seven books of literary criticism — in Telugu. A collection of his letters from prison, “Captive Imagination”, was also published by Penguin.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

According to the publishers, the book, a commemoration of Rao’s immense talent and passion for poetry, will be a first “authentic, representative collection” of his poems coming out in a single volume also including some poems translated into English exclusively for the edition.

“The image of Varavara Rao, smiling and fist raised, as he was taken into custody is imprinted on our minds. He exuded an aura of optimism, fortitude and strength. Who is Varavara Rao? What does he stand for? Where better to turn for answers than to his own words, the poems that convey with such extraordinary power his emotions, his thoughts and purpose,” Elizabeth Kuruvilla, executive editor, Penguin Random House India.

Rao has been in jail since the end of 2018 for alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rjaakt/article32246376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-varavara-rao,https://www.thehindu.com/books/translated-works-of-activist-poet-varavara-rao-to-release-in-2021/article32825774.ece
91,2020/10/11,Coronavirus | School closure may cost India dear,"Poor productivity will cause a major dent in future earnings: World Bank report.

The extended closure of schools amid the COVID-19 pandemic could dent India’s future earnings by anywhere between $420 billion and $600 billion, as depleted learning levels of students will translate into poorer productivity going forward, the World Bank has said.

Warning that as many as 5.5 million students could drop out of schools across South Asia, the bank has said dropouts, combined with substantial learning losses for those who remain enrolled in schools, would cost South Asia as much as $622 billion in future earnings and gross domestic product.

This figure could climb further to $880 billion, as per a more pessimistic scenario envisaged by the bank on the lifetime impact of school closures on the productivity of this generation of students.

Far-reaching impact

South Asian governments spend only $400 billion a year on primary and secondary education, so the total loss in economic output would be substantially higher, the bank highlighted.

“While the regional loss is largely driven by India, all countries will lose substantial shares of their GDP … The average child in South Asia may lose $4,400 in lifetime earnings once having entered the labour market, equivalent to 5% of total earnings,” the World Bank said in its latest South Asia report titled “Beaten or broken: Informality and COVID-19”.

Also read | Over 154 crore students hit by closure of schools, girls to be worst hit, says UNSECO

The report has flagged “far-reaching consequences” of lockdowns, apart from the obvious damage to businesses, consumption patterns and imposed social hardship on poor and vulnerable households, especially urban migrants and informal workers.

Massive losses

“Education came to a standstill and efforts to teach children during school closures proved challenging. The estimated costs of the school closures in terms of learning and earning losses are substantial … They have kept 391 million students out of school in primary and secondary education, further complicating efforts to resolve the learning crisis,” it said.

Remote learning tough

“Children have been out of school for approximately five months. Being out of school for that long means that children not only stop learning new things, they also forget some of what they have learned,” the bank said.

Also read | 24 million may drop out of school due to COVID-19 impact: U.N.

It added that engaging children through remote learning programmes had been difficult, despite most governments’ best efforts to mitigate the impact of school closures.

The projected learning loss for the region is 0.5 years of learning-adjusted years of schooling at present, and this will already lead to substantial future earning losses, the bank estimated.

Labour productivity will also take a greater hit from COVID-19 than most previous natural disasters, not just due to the disruptions in training and education.

Also read | Why e-learning isn’t a sustainable solution to the COVID-19 education crisis in India

“First, the increased integration of the global economy will amplify the adverse impact of COVID-19. Second, contagion prevention and physical distancing may render some activities, for example the hospitality sector, unviable unless they are radically transformed, which will take time. Even in less directly affected sectors such as manufacturing, banking and business, severe capacity underutilisation lowers total factor productivity while restrictions to stem the spread of the pandemic remain in place. Finally, disruptions to training, schooling and other education in the event of severe income losses, even once restrictions are lifted, will also lower human capital and labour productivity over the long term,” the report concluded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/akmagd/article32829192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SCHOOLCHILDRENjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/school-closure-may-cost-india-dear/article32828676.ece

In a report compiled by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D), the Maharashtra police have cited an incident in Malegaon in April where the police had to persuade doctors to treat all patients equally as the “doctors feared that treating patients from Muslim areas could infect their hospitals”.

The BPR&D, the police think tank of the Union Home Ministry, has published a report, “Indian police response to COVID-19 crisis”, where it sought contributions from the State police and the Central armed police forces (CAPF).

The petition said the “unfortunate incident of the Tablighi Jamaat was used to demonise and blame the entire Muslim community”.

On March 28, the Ministry wrote to all States that around 2,000 Tablighis from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and other countries who entered India on tourist visa appeared to be “potential carriers” of COVID-19.

‘Clinics were shut’

In the BPR&D report, Superintendent of Police, Malegaon, Sunil D. Kadasne said his knowledge of languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Urdu, Arabic, English and Madari Jaban (a local dialect of Malegaon) helped him establish a bridge between the people and the administration. He said that after he took charge in May, a “silent communal divide” was seen with Hindu patients being treated in Mahatma Gandhi Vidya Mandir and Muslim patients in Badi Malegaon High School.

He said Unani doctors were recruited as there was a shortage of allopathic doctors and there was prejudice in the mind of Muslim patients that Hindu doctors were not treating them. “Clinics were closed as the IMA [Indian Medical Association] and doctors feared that admitting COVID-positive patients from Muslim areas would infect their hospitals,” he said, adding that he persuaded the doctors to treat all patients with zeal and compassion, irrespective of religion.

The Chandigarh police said that after the news of spread of COVID infection during religious congregation held in New Delhi came to the fore, “participants of the congregation residing in Chandigarh were identified and subjected to health protocol”.

It said that due to personal connect of the police with Muslim religious leaders, the latter decided not to visit mosques and cemeteries to observe Shab-e-Baraat on April 9 and 10.

Influx of migrants

The Bihar police said an influx of huge number of Bihari migrants from other States created unique problems for Bihar but despite severe resource constraints, the police rose to the occasion.

The report mentioned that till August 21, 76,768 police and CAPF personnel tested positive and 401 personnel died. The highest number of personnel who were infected and died was reported in Maharashtra — 12,760 were infected and 129 died.

The family members of a 19-year-old Dalit woman, who died after allegedly being raped by four men in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh, will appear before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court amid tight security on Monday.

The court will record the version of the victim’s family in the case. It had on October 1 asked the woman’s parents to come to apprise it of their version of the incident.

95,2020/10/11,"At 15, RTI Act crippled by rising backlog","Transparency law hit by depleted panels, paltry penalties on officials

Fifteen years after the Right to Information (RTI) Act came into force, more than 2.2 lakh cases are pending at the Central and State Information Commissions, which are the final courts of appeal under the transparency law.

The increasing backlog is exacerbated by the fact that most Commissions are functioning at reduced capacity, including the Central Information Commission (CIC) which has been headless since August.

A report card brought out by the Satark Nagrik Sangathan and the Centre for Equity Studies to mark the anniversary on Monday found that Maharashtra had the highest number of pending appeals, with over 59,000 cases, followed by Uttar Pradesh (47,923) and the CIC (35,653).

At the current rate of disposal, the Odisha Commission would take more than seven years to dispose of all pending complaints, while the CIC would take more than two years, the report said.

Odisha is functioning with just four commissioners, while Rajasthan has only three. Jharkhand and Tripura have no commissioners at all, and have been defunct for months. The CIC has no chief, and only five commissioners.

Under the law, every commission should have a chief and up to 10 commissioners.

The analysis also found that government officials face hardly any punishment for violating the law. Analysing data from 16 commissions in 2019-20, report found that penalties were imposed in only 2.2% of cases that were disposed of, despite previous analysis showing a rate of about 59% violations which should have triggered the process of penalty imposition.

“Non-imposition of penalties in deserving cases by commissions sends a signal to public authorities that violating the law will not invite any serious consequences. This destroys the basic framework of incentives built into the RTI law and promotes a culture of impunity,” said the report.

Out of almost 90,000 cases disposed of by the 16 commissions between April 2019 to July 2020, show cause notices were issued in more than 15,700 cases, and penalties imposed in 1,995 cases. Gujarat accounted for more than 9,000 show cause notices, but only 163 penalties. Overall, fines imposed amounted to ₹2.53 crore.

“The need to scrutinise the functioning of information commissions now is perhaps greater than ever before, given the unprecedented crisis gripping the nation due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said the report, noting that relief and welfare programmes funded through public money are the sole lifeline for millions who have suddenly lost income-earning opportunities after the lockdown was imposed to contain the spread of the disease.

“If the poor and marginalised affected by the public health emergency are to have any hope of obtaining the benefits of government schemes, they must have access to relevant information,” the report noted.

“At a time when incentives for secrecy are great, and the scope for discretionary actions wide, the role of information commissions is crucial to ensure that people can obtain information on healthcare facilities, social security programs and delivery of essential goods and services meant for those in distress,” the report underlined.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u90scy/article31475744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-rti-logo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/at-15-rti-act-crippled-by-rising-backlog/article32827394.ece
96,2020/10/11,"Widespread use of sanitisers, soaps can worsen antimicrobial resistance: Experts","It needs to be addressed in totality by all sectors including healthcare, veterinary and agricultural domains, they say

Health experts at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) warned that the increased use of antibiotics and the widespread use of hand sanitisers and antimicrobial soaps, which has especially increased multi-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic, can worsen the situation of antimicrobial resistance. Stating this at a webinar on “Antibiotic resistance: Renewed Fight” earlier this week, Rama Chaudhry, Head, Department of Microbiology, AIIMS, Delhi said antibiotic resistant organisms have become rigidly established in our environment with many infections failing to respond to available antimicrobials.

“Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest challenges of modern medicine. This antimicrobial resistance mounts problems beyond the geographical as well as species barriers and can transmit from animals to humans. AMR needs to be addressed in totality by all sectors including healthcare, veterinary and agricultural domains. This is where one health approach comes into place,’’ she said in the webinar jointly organised by AIIMS and the American Society for Microbiology.

Experts said the pandemic has jolted the entire world with its reach and scale and has impacted the local health facilities.

“We are seeing more hospitalisation due to COVID-related complications with all our resources being focused primarily on dealing with it while many other important health issues such as AMR and other health programmes have taken a back seat,” she said. The Health Ministry on Sunday noted that the recoveries have crossed the milestone of 60 lakh (60,77,976).

97,2020/10/11,"Faster, premium trains to have only AC coaches soon","Currently on most routes, speeds of mail/express trains have a ceiling of 110 kilometres per hour or lower.

Trains running on identified routes at a speed of 130 kilometres per hour or above on the railway network will have only air-conditioned coaches in the near future as part of the Railways’ plans to upgrade the network, an official said on Sunday.

Stressing that the ticket prices of such trains will be affordable, railway ministry spokesperson D.J. Narain clarified that it should not be misconstrued that all non-AC coaches will be made into AC coaches.

Currently on most routes, speeds of mail/express trains have a ceiling of 110 kilometres per hour or lower.

Premium trains like Rajdhanis, Shatabdis and Durontos are allowed to operate at 120 kilometres per hour on significant parts of the Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonals. The rakes for such trains are fit to operate at 130 kilometres per hour or above, officials said.

AC coaches have become a technical necessity wherever the speed of the train is going to be above 130 kilometres per hour . Indian Railways is working on a massive plan to upgrade the railway network to high speed potential,” Mr. Narain said.

Tracks on the Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonals are being upgraded to cater to speeds of 130 kilometres per hour to 160 kilometres per hour. The non-AC sleeper coaches would be replaced by AC coaches only for such trains which will be running at 130/160 kilometres per hour .

Non-AC coaches will continue to run in trains running at 110 kilometres per hour,” he said.

“It will be ensured that while the price of tickets of modified AC coaches remains very affordable for the passengers, the comfort and conveniences increase manifold and there is substantial reduction in travel time, Mr. Narain said.

He said that a prototype of such an AC coach is being manufactured at Rail Coach Factory at Kapurthala and should be ready in a few weeks.

Presently, an 83-berth coach is being designed. It is planned to have 100 such coaches this year and 200 next year. The coaches will be evaluated and experience gained from the running of these coaches will lead to further progress, he said. Officials said that the new AC coaches will be economical as their tickets will be priced between AC 3 and Sleeper coaches.

Compared to 72 berths in a sleeper coach, this new AC coach will have 83 berths, but the number of berths in a coupe will remain the same. However, there will be no extra middle berth between side-upper and side-lower berths.

The coaches are being re-designed by moving the electrical units and removing the space reserved for storing blankets and bed sheets, since Railways will stop providing them due to coronavirus.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ipa187/article32499103.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-RAILWAYS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/non-ac-sleeper-coaches-to-be-replaced-by-ac-coaches-for-trains-running-at-130160-kmph-railways/article32826970.ece

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday that his Ministry will soon roll out the FELUDA paper strip test for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. This has been developed by CSIR-IGIB and has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India for a commercial launch. He added that the test showed 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity.

“This compares favourably to the ICMR’s current acceptation criteria of RT-PCR Kit of at least 95% sensitivity and at least 99% specificity,” Dr. Vardhan said, adding however, that “an exact date on the availability cannot be specified yet”.

Speaking about COVID-19 vaccine in his weekly social media interaction Sunday Samvaad, the Minister said it is anticipated that supplies would initially be available in limited quantities.

“In a huge country like India, it is critical to prioritise vaccine delivery based on various factors such as risk of exposure, co-morbidity among various population groups, the mortality rate among COVID cases...,” he said.

The Minister added that India is looking at the availability of several different types of vaccines, of which some may be suitable for a particular age group while others may not be.

Categorically denying rumours of the government prioritising young and working-class for the vaccine for economic reasons, Dr. Vardhan said, “The prioritisation of groups for COVID-19 vaccine shall be based on two key considerations: Occupational hazard and risk of exposure to infection, and the risk of developing severe disease and increased mortality.”

Also read: Coronavirus | Elder care is a priority, says Harsh Vardhan

On the issue of emergency-use authorisation of vaccines, the Minister said the issue is being deliberated at present and “adequate safety and efficacy data is required for approval... Further course of action will depend on the data generated.”

He informed that the COVID-19 vaccines currently in trial in India are 2-dose and 3-dose vaccines. Vaccine by Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech require 2 doses while the Cadila Healthcare vaccine requires 3 doses. For other vaccines in pre-clinical stages, the dosing is being tested, he stated.

On the need to include other novel candidates as COVID vaccine, Dr. Vardhan said, “Considering the large population size of India, one vaccine or vaccine manufacturer will not be able to fulfil the requirements of vaccinating the whole country. Therefore, we are open to assessing the feasibility of introducing several COVID-19 vaccines in the country as per their availability for the Indian population.”

On re-infection, the Minister said though there are sporadic reports of re-infection surfacing in various States, careful analysis of the ICMR database reveals that many of these cases have actually been mis-classified as re-infections.

He added that it is very important to differentiate mislabelled re-infection from actual re-infection. “Actual re-infection would mean a fully recovered person getting infected by a freshly introduced virus in his/her body, belonging to the same or different strain. ICMR is commissioning a study to understand the true burden of re-infected cases. Results will be shared in a couple of weeks,” he said.

Dr. Vardhan noted that the Central Government has so far, in the first phase, released ₹3,000 crore to States and UTs to battle the pandemic.

“Almost all, except three States/UTs, have utilised the complete grant given to them: Maharashtra has only used 42.5% of the grant followed by Chandigarh at 47.8% and Delhi at 75.4%,” he said.

Responding to criticism surrounding the efficacy of AYUSH formulations in the treatment of COVID-19, Dr. Vardhan said, “Guduchi, Ashwagandha, Guduchi & Pippali combination and AYUSH 64 have a substantial number of studies which prove their immunomodulatory [enhancing immune], anti-viral, antipyretic [fever reducing] and anti-inflammatory properties. These interventions have also shown a good binding affinity with COVID-19 virus in in-silico studies.”

He further said scientific studies have been initiated with the aforesaid remedies to assess their impact in the prophylaxis, secondary prevention and management of COVID-19 cases on the recommendations of the Interdisciplinary Task Force set up by the government.

Speaking about the benefits of the Ayurvedic formulation chyawanprash, Dr. Vardhan said the information available through clinical studies have shown that individuals who consume chyawanprash regularly for a definite period of time show improvement in overall health status and immunity and while sugar is an essential component, customers can opt for sugar-free versions in the market.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/20p5sn/article32826641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HarshVardhan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-roll-out-of-feluda-test-expected-in-next-few-weeks-says-harsh-vardhan/article32826642.ece
101,2020/10/11,Narendra Modi slams Opposition for ‘supporting’ middlemen,"The Prime Minister says the Opposition is peddling “lies” about his government’s efforts to introduce lasting reforms in agriculture and rural development.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Sunday attacked the Opposition which he said was advocating the interests of middlemen and peddling “lies” about his government’s efforts to introduce lasting reforms in agriculture and rural development.

He was speaking at a programme to launch the physical distribution of property cards under the ‘SVAMITVA’ (ownership) scheme via videoconferencing. The scheme uses drone and satellite technology to map physical assets in rural areas and aims at digitisation of property records, easing the way for village dwellers to access institutionalised credit against property. Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh Yogi Adityanath and Shivraj Singh Chouhan were present via video link during the programme which saw Mr. Modi interact with beneficiaries.

Stating that government had done more for villages and its residents in the last six years than what was done in the six decades before that, he referred to a number of projects, including opening of bank accounts, building of toilets and houses, cooking gas scheme and electrification.

“Rural India was left to fend for itself by those who ruled the country earlier, I cannot do that,” Mr. Modi said.

“Many people don't want villages, poor, farmers and labourers to be aatmanirbhar’,” he said, adding that his government's measures to empower them, including by directly transferring to farmers and others, had hit the Opposition hard by cutting off their source of illegitimate earning.

Without naming the Opposition, he said it was upset not for farmers but for themselves as it was for long strengthened by the power of middlemen, brokers and commission agents.

The Congress and the BJP’s own former ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal has been opposing the farm laws enacted by the government last month.

Parliament had passed The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 during the monsoon session.

“Those who looted the country are being recognised by people. That is why they are indulging in opposition, bad-mouthing (government) and using foul language. They are not bothered about the poor, villages or the country. They are troubled by all the good work. They want to stop the development march of the country,” Mr. Modi said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vqwi1f/article32749858.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-attacks-rivals-for-opposing-agri-reforms-says-middlemen-powered-their-politics/article32826347.ece

The move will pave the way for villagers to use property as a financial asset for taking loans and other financial benefits.

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has said the launch will enable around one lakh property holders to download their property cards through an SMS link sent on their mobile phones, and this would be followed by the physical distribution of property cards by respective state governments.

These beneficiaries are from 763 villages across six States, including 346 from Uttar Pradesh, 221 from Haryana, 100 from Maharashtra, 44 from Madhya Pradesh, 50 from Uttarakhand and two from Karnataka.

104,2020/10/11,Convict serving life term held three months after jumping parole,"Sharpshooter was involved in attack on Rakesh Roshan in January 2000

A notorious criminal and sharpshooter, who was allegedly involved in the attack on Bollywood director Rakesh Roshan in 2000, has been arrested in Thane city of Maharashtra nearly three months after he jumped parole, a senior official said on Saturday.

The accused, Sunil V. Gaikwad (52), was nabbed from Parsik Circle area in Kalwa around 9 p.m. on Friday, he said. “We had received a tip-off that Gaikwad is coming to Parsik Circle area. Accordingly, we laid a trap and caught him,” senior inspector of the Central Crime Unit Anil Honrao said. “The accused has 11 cases of murder and seven cases of attempt to murder registered against him. One of these includes attempt on Bollywood director Rakesh Roshan’s life in 2000,” Mr. Honrao said.

Roshan was shot at outside his Santacruz office in Mumbai in January 2000. The assailants had fired six rounds, of which two bullets had hit Roshan, according to the police.

“Gaikwad had been sentenced to life imprisonment in a murder case and was lodged at Nashik central jail. However, he came out on a 28-day parole on June 26 this year,” the official said.

“He was expected to return to the jail after completion of the parole period, but he did not do so. He was hiding till his arrest last night,” Mr. Honrao added.

According to the official, the accused was active during 1999 and 2000 and was involved in several crimes. He was associated with the notorious gangs of Ali Budesh and Subhash Singh Thakur. During the same period, he was also involved in a dacoity in Nashik, where he had opened fire on police personnel, he said.

“Gaikwad will be handed over to the Pant Nagar police, where an offence of escape has been registered,” Mr. Honrao said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/convict-serving-life-term-held-three-months-after-jumping-parole/article32825141.ece
105,2020/10/11,Digital forensics: the new normal in crime investigation,"In the backdrop of the multi-agency investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, the role of digital forensics science has come to the fore with digital data being extensively used in the investigation, people familiar with the probes said.

Multiple Central agencies — the Enforcement Directorate, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Narcotics Control Bureau — have been looking at various angles in the case.

Licensed equipment, software and algorithms are being used to investigate digital data when the accused refuse to open up.

Investigators said they had managed to retrieve significant and relevant data (from storage devices and from the cloud), which had been either erased or overwritten or simply hidden.

After retrieving, they analysed, dissected and reconstructed the data to use in the investigations and deciding on the future course of action.

In the fast-paced digital and cyber forensics work undertaken by experts, this is possibly for the first time that latest digital/ cyber forensics tools and techniques from the U.S., Israel and Germany were deployed in India for gathering crucial information while adhering to the Evidence Act and the IT Act, people in the know said.

For the first time ever, sharpest investigative minds familiar with traditional methods and the best-in-class digital forensic sleuths collaborated to reach at conclusions. So one does not hear anything on the money laundering allegations levelled by the late actor’s family these days and rather the probe has moved towards drug consumption and peddling in the Hindi film industry in general.

Investigative bodies said they found evidence from 2017 and beyond. The investigation was not just restricted to mobile devices but also to emails, online drives, hard disk drives, cloud logs.

In today’s digital world when every person or crime leaves a digital trail behind, investigative bodies such as the NCB is believed to have used cyber-digital forensics to prove consumption, possession or peddling because no matter how hard the accused try to erase their trails, the digital trail can never be fully eliminated or erased.

Commenting on the trend, former law enforcement officer & digital fraud investigator Makarand Wagh, managing director, Macans Infotech said, “There is a thin line between accessing evidence and destroying evidence.”

“We always use the best licensed equipment and complex software from the West and Israel to avoid compromising the integrity of the evidence, which happens if one uses unlicensed equipment, tools and software from the open source,” he said,

“We offer the most comprehensive and exhaustive forensics-related certification and safety backups to all customers be it from the private or government sector during the investigations,” Mr. Wagh said.

According to legal experts, forensic digital crime experts can provide circumstantial evidence to the investigative bodies up to the time of the filing of the FIR, but the courts will only rely on primary evidence. Thus the digital data helps in strengthening the case or deciding in closing it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/j0h1op/article32831581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMLalatenduG7N7RN0DK3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/digital-forensics-the-new-normal/article32824516.ece
106,2020/10/11,Protests staged for Amaravati as capital,"Agitation being spearheaded by the JAC to complete 300 days today

Massive protest rallies were taken out at many places across the State on Sunday to express solidarity with the farmers and residents of the villages located in the Amaravati region, who had been agitating for the last 299 days in support of their demand that the government drop its plan to shift the capital out of Amaravati, to Visakhapatnam.

The Amaravati agitation will complete 300 days on Monday.

Leaders of the opposition parties and representatives of various organisations had expressed solidarity for the cause at an all-party meeting organised by leaders of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi Joint Action Committee (JAC) recently.

A large number of farmers and members of the Amaravati Mahila JAC started in a rally from Thullur holding green flags and raising slogans of ‘Jai Amaravati’.

Farmers from Anantavaram, Nekkalu, Rayapudi, Velagapudi, Borupalem, Venkatayapalem and Krishnayapalem participated in the rally.

Amaravati Mahila JAC member and Congress leader Sunkara Padmasri warned Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy against incurring the wrath of women.

She said the Chief Minister’s indifference to the cause of the farmers reflected his arrogance. The farmers of the region had given 33,000 acres to the government to develop a new capital, but Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was hell bent on ruining this region, she alleged.

Mild tension

In Guntur, the JAC leaders staged a dharna at the Shankar Vilas junction. Leaders of the TDP, the BJP and the Left parties participated in the protest. At one point, there was mild tension when the police stopped the leaders from going ahead with a rally that followed the dharna.

Participating in the protest, former Minister Nakka Anand Babu lambasted the government for his “indifference to the aspirations of five-crore people” of the State. He said not just the TDP and other parties but also people of the entire State wanted Amaravati to continue as the single capital.

The leaders said that the YSRCP government was trying to suppress the agitation by giving it a caste colour while the fact was that over 70% of the population in the region comprised Dalits and weaker sections.

An attempt by the city Congress leaders to take out a rally on the BRTS Road in Vijayawada was foiled by the police who placed them under house arrest.

111,2020/10/11,Virtual workshop held on Madhubani painting,"Participants in event include those from reputed foreign universities

A two-day virtual workshop on Madhubani painting was conducted by the Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing, Kurnool.

Shalinee Kumari Jha, faculty of Department of Creative Arts, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, conducted the workshop. Madhubani painting is an ancient cultural art form of Bihar which dates back to the Ramayana. Paintings were first done on Khobar Ghar (nuptial chamber of the newly wed couple) and on the walls, with mud and cow dung. The walls of Mithila’s houses were painted to welcome the wedding procession of Lord Shri Rama.

It was a lost art form until 1934. British colonial officer for Madhubani district, William G. Archer, ‘discovered’ the paintings while inspecting the damage caused by the 1934 earthquake.

The workshop was inaugurated by IIITDM Kurnool director D.V.L.N. Somayajulu and he narrated the importance of learning traditional art forms. “Ms. Shalinee Jha is considered one of the progressive artists of our times and her themes combine traditional methods with contemporary issues which make her art highly successful,” said Mr. Somayajulu.

Besides the students of IIITDM, Kurnool, the workshop had participants from across India, and reputed foreign universities.

‘Source of artistic innovation’

“Mithila painting is deeply rooted in its ancient iconographic traditions, but recently Mithila painting has become a source of artistic innovation with new training systems (provided by Mithila Art Institute) and is focusing on modern and social themes,” said Ms. Shalinee Jha whose painting is displayed at the Asian Art Museum.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/virtual-workshop-held-on-madhubani-painting/article32828074.ece

113,2020/10/11,Roundtable opposes move to privatise MR College,"Leaders of various parties, organisations express concern over developments in MANSAS Trust

Representatives of various opposition parties, civic societies and students’ organisations have asked the government to run itself the MR College instead of privatising the institution as it will deprive many poor and middle class students of an opportunity to pursue higher studies at an affordable fee structure.

At a roundtable organised here on Sunday by Lok Satta Party to discuss the issues related to MR College and alleged irregularities in MANSAS Trust, speakers said the aided college was the lone institution in the district headquarters to offer many courses with 12 major departments. Member of AP Legislative Council Pakalapati Raghuvarama expressed concern over delay in the admission process for the academic year 2020-21. “Future of over 4,000 students hangs in balance due to the ongoing controversy,” he said.

Lok Satta Party State president Bhisetti Babji said that the MR College issue was not an internal matter of Pusapati family members -- Ashok Gajapathi Raju, Sanchaiata Gajapathi Raju and Urmila Gajapathi Raju -- who have been at loggerheads with regard to MANSAS Trust. Forum for a Better Vizianagaram president M. Venkateswara Rao said that the old students of the college were unhappy with the developments in the college which was established in 1879.

‘Staff a worried lot’

Congress Party general secretary Jammu Narayana and Jana Sena leader Tyada Ramakrishna said the teaching and non-teaching staff were at their wits’ end in the wake of the developments in the trust.

Jana Vignana Vedika State president M.V.R. Krishnaji, representatives of teachers’ associations Alluri Siva Varma, Gullipalli Jayapal and others participated in the roundtable.

115,2020/10/11,A farmhand's daughter becomes 'One Day' Collector,"Child Rights and Animal Care are her priorities.

Daughter of a farm labourer, 16-year-old M. Sravani, assumed the office of Anantapur District Collector on Sunday and it was dream-come-true for the Senior Intermediate student of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) Garladinne. She was named ‘One-Day Collector’ as part of the International Day of Girls celebrations.

Wearing a cotton saree, she was nervous till her name was announced through a draw of lots in front of a battery of mediapersons in the District Collector’s office complex on Sunday morning, but once announced she did not blink an eyelid to boldly tell the world about her priorities as ‘One Day Collector’. District Collector Gandham Chandrudu launched the ‘Balike Bhavishyathu’ (Girl Child is the future of society) programme in the district to bring awareness on the rights of adolescent girls in the society and provide them with the respect due and right place in the society.

“We have forgotten to care for the animals and keep our surroundings clean,” said Ms. Sravani. The entire gathering of prominent women from various NGOs at the Collector’s chamber and the district officials were stunned to hear the ‘One-Day Collector’ speak as she was very clear in her mind that she aspired to become a teacher when she grew up and ensure all the school dropouts are educated.

To provide some sanctity to the exercise, she was given a file that sanctioned Rs.25,000 compensation to a woman, who was a victim in an SC/ST Atrocities Case, and Ms. Sravani read the entire file and singed on the dotted lines. The RDT Hospital Director Vishala Ferrer, the REDS president Bhanuja were there to guide the ‘One Day Collector and Ms. Sravani signing a second file explained that working women had other domestic responsibilities to fulfil towards their families, so a decision was taken by the District Administration that none of the woman employees would be contacted for official work between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.

K. Chinmayi, a 10th Standard student of Sarada School, assumed office as ‘One-Day Municipal Commissioner’ and put forth her solution for the adolescent girls’ problems in school. “Menstruating girls sometimes find it difficult to find a sanitary napkin and the right place and atmosphere to dispose of the used one,” she said seeking to set up vending machines for the sanitary napkins at schools.

She along with the ‘One-Day Collector’ inspected the sanitation in the city and working of the Ward Secretariat in ‘First Line’ area of Anantapur, while the Municipal Commissioner PVVS Murthy accompanied them.

Several Dalit families have urged the government to probe into the alleged land grabbing in various villages of Ranasthalam mandal accusing the leaders of the YSRCP of indulging in illegal activities. They alleged that D patta lands worth crores of rupees were grabbed in Bantupalli, Sancham, Kamma Sigadam, Krishnapuram and other villages of the mandal.

They staged demonstrations in the villages and submitted a memorandum to Ranasthalam tahsildar Sudhar Rani, urging her to issue notices to those who allegedly grabbed lands. The Dalits, including T. Chinna Ramudu and T. Appla Suramma, said that the lands were in their possession for the last 50 years with valid documents.

“The then Collector, K. Dhananjya Reddy, conducted an inquiry and protected our lands when the local leaders tried to grab them. But same is being repeated now as they have the support from the ruling YSRCP,"" they alleged.

117,2020/10/11,Private school managements seek aid to tide over financial crisis,"COVID-19 has dealt a severe blow, they lament

Representatives of private educational managements on Saturday said the prolonged lockdown that had necessitated closure of their institutions had resulted in serious financial crisis that could be addressed only if the government extended a few concessions to them.

A Joint Action Committee, formed by the representatives, said the COVID-19 pandemic had dealt a severe blow to their financial status and urged the government to come to their rescue.

Andhra Pradesh Unaided Managements Association State general secretary K. Tulasi Vishnu Prasad said there were some key issues which needed clarity. Seeking immediate release of the academic calendar, he said there was no clarity in the government's online classes policy and reduction of syllabus.

Their other requests included one year moratorium on school renewal norm and extension of Jagananna Vidya Kanuka scheme to children in private schools who were below poverty line.

Andhra Pradesh Private Schools Association honorary president V. Sundar Rao suggested that private schools be divided into corporate, budget and semi-budget school categories and financial assistance be given to budget and semi-budget schools. He said budget schools should be exempted from the fee norms being implemented by the Fee Regulation and Monitoring Committee.

Gajuwaka Independent Private Schools Association leader P. Bhaskar Rao said teachers did not receive their salaries due to the lockdown and were finding it difficult to make both ends meet. He said many of them may even resort to the extreme step in the absence of livelihood.

The Chittoor crime police on Saturday nabbed a notorious burglar and seized half a kg of gold ornaments and a brand new car from him, worth about ₹30 lakh, after intercepting him on the outskirts on the Chittoor-Vellore (T.N.) road.

As per information, the house of a jewelry merchant at a posh locality in Chittoor was subjected to burglary on the night of August 20.

The COVID-19 cases in Chittoor district crossed the 70,000-mark on Saturday, followed by over 700 casualties. In spite of the daily average of cases emerging at 800, the recovery rate at 90% has come as a breather to the officials in the district.

Special medical teams

“The recovery rate is close to 90% in the district in recent days, while the number of cases under institutional admission is around 4,000, and about 2,000 under home isolation.

121,2020/10/11,15 crore people suffering from mental health problems: expert,"‘Of them, only 3 crore have access to proper medical care’

As many as 15 crore people in the country are suffering from mental health problems but only 3 crore have access to proper medical care, leaving nearly 80% of them without medical aid. The available statistics suggest one in every 10 individuals require mental health attention and one in 20 suffer from depressive disorder, says N.N. Raju, a professor of psychiatry, in a statement on the occasion of World Mental Health Day.

A total of 1.34 lakh persons committed suicide in India in 2018 and 3/4th of them could have been saved, if good mental health facilities were made available to them in time. The funds allocated to mental health are a meagre 0.05% of the total health budget, which indicates the sorry state of affairs.

Yoga and meditation

B.P. Lalitha, psychiatrist at KIMS ICON Hospital, suggests allocating time for oneself , doing yoga and meditation, spending time with family and friends and recreation were needed to avoid mental health issues.

One should increase their awareness on mental health issues by reading books, listening to talks by experts and watching videos on the subject.

The speakers, at a meeting, came down heavily on the Central and the State governments for their ‘failure’ to control the growing incidence of violence and attacks on women and Dalits.

The meeting, organised jointly by the Left parties and Dalit and women organisations here on Saturday, called for concerted action plan to deal with the situation. CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy alleged that the attacks on Dalits and rape of women were increasing under the BJP government at the Centre and under the YSR Congress Party government in the State. Decrying the delay in justice to victims and foisting of cases on those who were supporting the victims, he called for united action to oppose such trends. He demanded action against the perpetrators of the crime in the Hathras case.

CPI-ML leader Ganesh Panda called for a change in the attitude of society to end such crimes. The meeting adopted resolutions to take out a rally from Saraswathi Park to the Gandhi statue near GVMC on October 13, to protest against the growing attacks on Dalits and increasing incidence of rapes. It also resolved to create awareness among people on these issues through various forms of protest.

123,2020/10/11,"People should not panic in case of gas leak, says expert","‘Move the cylinder to an open area and ensure there is no spark’

The city experienced two domestic cylinder leaks, with one resulting in blast and the other leading to fire in kitchen on Friday night.

In one case at Sabbavaram, the leak led to a blast, in which six people, including three inmates and the others who had come to their rescue, were injured, with one 45-year-old woman being said to be critical.

In another leak that resulted in a fire in the kitchen at Marripalem, there were no injuries. But there was some property damage. In both the cases, the police and the Fire Department took steps to prevent further damage. But the moot question is how can there be a fire in case of a leak in domestic cylinder.

According to S.P.B. Rangacharyulu, president, Fire and Security Association of India (Vizag chapter), fire can be avoided if the inmates do not panic. “A minor caution is enough,” he said.

Analysing both the cases, he said, “It is clear that there was a leak from the cylinders in both the cases, but there must have been a source of fire in both the cases.”

It is learnt that in the case in Sabbavaram, when gas was leaking from the cylinder, one of the injured had lit a candle. When gas leaks a vapour cloud is formed in the area and a small spark from the friction created while closing a door or switching on the exhaust fan, is enough to cause fire. “And if the fire enters the cylinder, then there can be a blast,” said Mr. Rangacharyulu.

124,2020/10/11,Property tax: MCC to go after habitual defaulters,"The Mysuru City Corporation is facing a severe cash crunch

In a new drive, localities whose residents are known to be defaulting on property tax payment for years now, will be targeted and forced to remit the amount to the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) which is facing a severe cash crunch.

Though there are nearly 1.75 lakh registered properties in the MCC limits, there are areas and localities within the city where the revenue inspectors and assistant commissioners hesitate to approach the owners to pay property tax. There have been instances where the MCC staff have been roughed up or even threatened in the past. In view of the current financial crisis and the imperatives of mopping up additional revenue, the MCC passed a resolution in a council meeting recently to widen the tax net.

Mayor Tasneem said all the elected councillors will join MCC inspectors and officials in the tax collection drive which will commence from Monday (October 12) and continue for a fortnight. The elected representatives will convince the habitual defaulters to pay the tax. Assistant commissioners of different zones of the MCC have made a list of defaulters.

The drive, however, will be led by the zonal ACs who will have the list of defaulters in their respective zones. All residential units, commercial complexes and revenue layouts within the MCC jurisdiction will be covered during the drive that will be held from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m

Property tax is one of the major sources of revenue for the MCC and the target for the current financial year is ₹140 crore. However, the Mayor said the MCC was lagging behind in mopping up the revenue and hence the drive was needed. According to a senior official in the MCC, the city body had collected nearly ₹71.4 crore from 96,475 property owners as on October 3.

This is the second such drive conceived by the MCC in the last 10 days. The earlier drive to make people tax compliant entailed upon the MCC to go to different wards of the city and set up temporary kiosks to enable payment of property tax. This was initiated as many regular tax payers were staying back due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and hesitating to go to the MCC zonal offices for tax remittance.

Though the MCC has already introduced an online system of property tax payment, individuals have to make a one-time visits to collect their unique property ID which has been generated for each property under the MCC limits.

From next year, the entire transaction can be online. But the door-to-door collection drive seem to be the only solution to deal with habitual defaulters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gux266/article32829227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGPROPERTYTAX,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/property-tax-mcc-to-go-after-habitual-defaulters/article32829228.ece

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa held a meeting with senior officials on the precautions to be taken against the spread of COVID-19 during Dasara celebrations in Mysuru.

Apart from Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, the meeting held at the Chief Minister’s Home Office ‘Krishna’ was attended by Chief Secretary T.M. Vijaybhaskar, Additional Chief Secretary Javed Akhtar, Commissioner of Health and Family Welfare Pankaj Kumar Pandey, Tourism Department’s Principal Secretary T.K. Anil Kumar and Mysuru’s Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri.

Mr. Sudhakar tweeted that the meeting discussed the precautions to be taken to ensure the health and safety of the general public and tourists visiting Mysuru for Dasara amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The meeting comes after a COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee visited Mysuru and submitted a report to the government, imposing restrictions during the celebrations of the annual Dasara festival, which is scheduled to begin on October 17.

Among other things, the committee has recommended that the gathering for the inauguration atop Chamundi Hills should not be more than 200 while the number of people gathering inside Mysuru palace for the Vijayadashami procession should be restricted to 300. Also, the committee has made it mandatory for all participants including officials, security personnel, staff, media, artistes and others to undergo RT-PCR tests conducted after October 14.

Meanwhile, Minister for Co-operation S.T. Somashekar, who is also the Minister in-charge of Mysuru district, made a telephonic call to former Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru Abhiram G. Sankar, inviting him to the Dasara festivities.

127,2020/10/11,Associations demand uniformity in midterm holidays for schools,"‘Allow online classes for limited number of hours every day’

The government’s decision to declare midterm holidays for government, aided and unaided schools following the State board syllabus has received mixed reactions from parents, teachers and other stakeholders.

Many schools said they had already planned midterm exams and what portions would be covered for October following the government’s initial decision to cancel midterm holidays, while others argued that online classes for a limited number of hours every day should be allowed to make up for lost time.

Teachers and parents expressed concern over whether portions will be covered in time. A teacher, who did not want to be named, said that there were many institutions that followed the State board and CBSE and/or ICSE under different sections. “This decision will create a lack of uniformity among the boards. Parents may also worry as one set of students will not have any classes while their peers in other boards will continue learning online,” the teacher said.

C.A. Ramesh of Suma Public School in the city, while welcoming the decision said that online classes for two hours a day should have been permitted so that children don’t lose their focus.“Parents can keep their children constructively and productively engaged. More importantly, the government can use this break to improve access to internet connectivity and infrastructure, especially in rural areas,” he said.

Managements have sought more clarity from the government. Shashidhar Dindur, secretary of Recognised Unaided Schools Association, said the government should come up with clear and comprehensive guidelines. “The government should, on a priority basis, issue guidelines and plans for the academic year 2020-21 so that once online classes resume we will know what to do and how to go about it,” he said.

Shashi Kumar D., General Secretary of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, has requested the Department of Primary and Secondary Education to issue clear orders on online classes. “This is discriminatory as only one set of schools get holidays and the others do not,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/associations-demand-uniformity-in-midterm-holidays-for-schools/article32828938.ece
128,2020/10/11,Leopard habitats and wild prey base outside protected areas eroding: Study,"Survey also shows that natural habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops, and presence of large wild prey are extremely important for leopard presence

Gradual erosion of large wild prey outside protected areas (PAs) has forced leopards to switch to livestock adding to human-leopard conflict across the State as also the country.

The loss of prey base is due to poaching, habitat destruction (outside protected areas) and disturbance due to mining, quarrying, linear projects and so on.

A new study shows that natural habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops, and presence of large wild prey (ungulates >20 kg body weight) are extremely important for leopard presence though it is a common belief that they survive and do extremely well in human dominated landscape.

The study was conducted by conservation biologist Sanjay Gubbi and his team from Nature Conservation Foundation. They argued that protecting natural wild prey can be a key factor in reducing human-leopard conflict.

The study is significant as there are at least 2,500 leopards in Karnataka alone and a significant number of them thrive outside protected areas which do not receive conservation priority.

This is leading to depletion of wild prey base such as spotted deer, sambar and other wild animals and forcing leopards to target livestock, according to the authors of a paper titled “Every hill has its leopard: Patterns of space use by leopards (Panthera pardus) in a mixed-use landscape in India” published in the international journal PeerJ.

Mr. Gubbi said many leopard habitats outside the protected areas face severe threat from quarrying, mining, infrastructure development, and loss of wild prey to poaching. “If leopards are to survive outside protected areas, we need scientifically assessed zoning where some areas have to be prioritised for leopard conservation and designate some areas for natural resource extraction,” he added.

Despite leopards being widespread and their numbers being reasonably high in the country, there is severe lack of scientific data on their distribution and population especially outside protected areas.

The researchers carried out occupancy surveys — a scientific methodology to understand where a species occurs and what factors drive their presence — in nearly 24,000 sq. km area, walked 2,768 km and in terms of the geographical area, this is perhaps the largest field study on leopards in the country ever done, said Mr. Gubbi.

To understand where the probability of leopards presence was higher, the researchers compared occupancy of leopards in natural habitats (forests, rocky outcrops), human-dominated areas (agricultural fields such as sugarcane plantations, maize fields and other areas with little or no natural habitats), and intermediate habitats (areas that had a mix of natural habitats and human-dominated areas).

The highest presence of leopards was found in grids that have natural habitats and consisted of large wild prey such as chital, sambar, four-horned antelope, barking deer, wild pig and others.

This is the first of its study that compared leopard presence in different habitats throwing new light about leopards’ habitat and food preferences. This baseline data can be used in the study area for understanding leopard distributional changes in the future. It can also be used to check if leopards have been colonising new areas or if they go locally extinct, Mr. Gubbi said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/o9zv4j/article32828936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGLEOPARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/leopard-habitats-and-wild-prey-base-outside-protected-areas-eroding-study/article32828937.ece
129,2020/10/11,Congress demands resignation of Yediyurappa,"It demands probe into alleged housing scam where Karnataka Chief Minister’s family members are said to be involved

Demanding a time-bound judicial inquiry into an alleged housing scam where Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s family members are said to be involved, the Congress on Sunday asked for the resignation of the Chief Minister.

Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters here, Congress MP and spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi alleged that the BJP government in Karnataka is “engulfed in the clutches of corruption with dented, tainted leaders ruling the roost.”

Mr. Singhvi questioned the “silence” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J.P. Nadda over the reported allegations of corruption and kickbacks against the son, son-in-law, and grandson of Mr. Yediyurappa in a ₹662-crore construction of apartments/housing project in Bengaluru.

The Congress spokesperson said documents available in the “public domain” showed the nature of transactions. He cited a purported communication between a close relative of Mr. Yediyurappa and another person referring to a bribe paid by a contractor to a top Bengaluru Development Authority official.

Mr. Singhvi claimed that an additional bribe was sought and paid through shell companies in Kolkata.

“If the Chief Minister has the slightest sense of shame, he must resign or be sacked,” he said.

“The most remarkable and virtually admitted allegations of unabashed corruption and we don’t even find a criminal investigation ... Appoint a sitting Supreme Court [judge] or a sitting Chief Justice of a High Court as an inquirer for two months,” he added.

Earlier, when Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah made the allegations against the Chief Minister in the Karnataka Assembly last month, Mr. Yediyurappa dismissed them as “baseless” and challenged the opposition leader to prove the charges.

“If you have nothing to fear, why are you not ordering an inquiry? Why an FIR has not been registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act?” asked Mr. Singhvi.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1ae4nb/article32828794.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-LT-YEDIYURAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-demands-resignation-of-yediyurappa/article32828795.ece

Two beaches in the State are among the eight in the country that have bagged the coveted eco-label ‘Blue Flag’ from the international agency Foundation for Environment Education, Denmark. The two are Kasarkod beach near Honnavar in Uttara Kannada and Padubidri beach near Udupi.

Earlier, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change had embarked upon a programme for ‘Blue Flag’ certification for select 13 beaches in the country.

According to the Ministry, a ‘Blue Flag’ beach is an eco-tourism model to provide tourists clean and hygienic bathing water, facilities/amenities, safe and healthy environment and sustainable development of the area. The certification is awarded by the Denmark-based agency based on 33 stringent criteria in four major heads that is environmental education and information, bathing water quality, environment management and conservation and safety and services in the beaches.

A communiqué from Arvind Nautiyal, National Project Director, Society for Integrated Coastal Management (SICOM) under the Ministry to the district administrations of Uttara Kannada and Udupi said on Sunday that the International Jury of the Denmark agency “would like to award the Blue Flag to the very first eight beaches in India”.

Kasarkod and Padubidri beaches have grey water treatment plants, solid waste management plants, disabled-friendly equipment to enable them to enter seawater, seating arrangements, clean drinking water, washroom, changing room, bathing facility, disabled-friendly and general toilets, parking facilities, solar power plant, solar lighting, and the like.

K. Harish Kumar, Deputy Commissioner, Uttara Kannada, who heads the District Tourism Development Committee, told The Hindu that the certification has prompted the Uttara Kannada administration to develop more beaches to attract a large number of tourists for promoting tourism in the district. The district has immense potential for the same. “We have identified three more beaches to develop on the lines of Kasarkod beach,” he said adding that two year’s effort had gone into developing Kasarkod beach.

Purushottam S., Deputy Director, Tourism, Uttara Kannada, said that a 750-m-long safe swimming zone has been created in Kasarkod, which is 2.5-km long. There is facility for sun bath, the beach has a gym, children’s play area, a watch tower. The government has spent about ₹8 crore to develop the beach in the past two years.

Chandrashekar Naik, in-charge Assistant Director (Tourism) and Deputy Director, Agriculture, Udupi, said that 500 m stretch of the Padubidri beach had been developed at an estimated cost of ₹10.68 crore over the past two years.

The Congress party organized a farmers’ meet in Mandya on Saturday, highlighting their fight against the farm bills of the BJP government at the Centre and in the State.

While All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary in-charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala, who addressed the gathering of farmers, accused the BJP government of launching ‘an assault on the farmers’, who he called the ‘soul of India’, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said the Congress will return to power in the State and the Centre and withdraw the anti-farmer laws that threatened to push the farmers into an abyss.

Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief D.K. Shivakumar said the meet had been organised to send the voice of the farmers from Mandya to the national capital. He called upon the farmers to participate in the country-wide signature campaign through which Congress leader Sonia Gandhi plans to highlight the farmers’ woes to President Ram Nath Kovind.

Mr. Surjewala warned that the Narendra Modi-led government’s new farm bills would lead to an eventual dismantling of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) structure in the country, deny the farmers the minimum support price and bring them under the control of a handful capitalists.

During the last three years, the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane had been increased by only ₹10 from the earlier ₹275 to ₹285. When the Manmohan Singh-led Congress government was in power in the Centre, the FRP had been increased from ₹117 to ₹220, he said.

He lashed out at the B.S. Yediyurappa government in Karnataka for amending to the Karnataka State Land Reforms Act, paving the way for agricultural land to be purchased by land sharks.

Mr. Siddaramaiah said he raised the anti-farmer laws brought in by the State government in the Legislative Assembly, but his opposition fell on the deaf ears of the BJP government. He called upon the farmers to mobilise themselves against the Bills and force the government to withdraw them.

Mr. Shivakumar said the ‘anti-farmer and anti-labour’ Bills of the State government had been defeated in the Legislative Council and thanked the members of the Legislative Council for the concern they had shown the farmers and the working class.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9596d0/article32825928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGCONGRESSNEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farm-bills-it-is-an-assault-on-farmers-says-surjewala/article32825929.ece

Excessive rains across most parts of the State during this year’s South West monsoon are now set to retreat. Meanwhile, the pandemic has not affected agricultural activity if the sowing status is any indication, as per the reports of the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC)

The sowing target for kharif was 73 lakh hectares against which the actual coverage as of September 30, 2020, was 77.5 lakh hectares. This is more than the actual area covered during the corresponding period last year when 68.84 hectares was brought under sowing, KSNDMC’s statistics reveal.

The coverage of foodgrains was spread over 53.75 lakh hectares, oil seeds accounted for 10.05 lakh hectares and cash crop was spread over 13.69 lakh hectares. Rice coverage was spread over 10.36 lakh hectares while 6.72 lakh hectares was brought under ragi. Maize accounted for 14.14 lakh hectares and jowar covered an area of 0.73 lakh hectares in the State. Besides, 19.58 lakh hectares was brought under pulses.

South Interior Karnataka comprising 11 districts brought in 20.44 lakh hectares of land under sowing against the target of 22.74 lakh hectares and the area met 90% of the target.

North Interior Karnataka comprising 12 districts brought 50.69 lakh hectares under sowing against a target of 46.81 lakh hectares and achieved 108% of the actual target, as per KSNDMC statistics.

Meanwhile, continuing rains in parts of South Interior Karnataka attributed to the low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, are expected to persist for a few days but will not have any negative impact on standing crops.

Local authorities said paddy was the only major standing crop in the region and the current spell of rains will not affect as it was still in the growth stage.

Paddy cultivation

The Joint Director of Agriculture in Mysuru, Mahanteshappa, said over 1 lakh hectares of land have been brought under paddy cultivation in Mysuru district and the current spell of rains will not affect the crops at this stage. But blast disease or Benki Roga can afflict the crops though it can be managed by the farmers.

Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has accused Telangana and Goa of trying to create new a controversy over the sharing of Krishna and Mahadayi waters and assured that the State government would not allow injustice to be meted out to Karnataka in this regard.

In a press release issued after a telephonic talk with Union Minister of Water Resources Gajendra Singh Shekhavat, Mr. Jarkiholi has said that the State government would present its arguments effectively before the Union government and the Supreme Court.

Mr. Jarkiholi has said that Telangana was trying to make an issue out of Krishna river water sharing on which the tribunal had already given its final verdict in 2013. “Already water share has been allocated to the States of Karnataka, Maharashtra and the earlier united Andhra Pradesh. The Union government too has decided to notify the verdict after the Supreme Court verdict. At this point, Telangana’s plea for setting up new water disputes tribunal is illogical,” he said.

The Minister has said in the release that he had discussed in detail the issue with the Mr. Shekhawat following a plea for new tribunal by Telengana. During the telephonic conversation, he had urged the Union Minister not to bring Karnataka in between the differences between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as already Krishna River Disputes Tribunal had given its final verdict in 2013.

Clear orders

As the water requirements of Telangana had already been considered as it was part of the united Andhra Pradesh, Telangana had to get its share from Andhra Pradesh and various SC orders too were clear in this regard. Considering these facts, the two States should sit together and sort out the differences in water sharing through dialogue. The demand for new tribunal was certainly not a justifiable one, Mr. Jarkiholi had told the Union Minister, the release said.

On Mahadayi

Regarding Mahadayi, Mr. Jarkiholi termed the contempt petition by Goa government ‘ludicrous’.

“Already, Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal has given its final verdict and the Centre too has notified the verdict. It is really funny that Goa government has now filed a contempt of court petition against the Karnataka government,” he has said in the release.

Terming the photographs and videos released by Goa government ‘fabricated documents’, Mr. Jarkiholi said the Karnataka government would face the charges effectively in the SC. He said he had received a factual report on the ground situation from the committee comprising of senior officials of Water Resources Department from both the States.

137,2020/10/11,Karnataka ranks third in attracting investments in Q2,"Besides investments in and around Bengaluru, many industrial areas in north Karnataka are attracting investments: Shettar

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the flow of investments into Karnataka in the second quarter of this financial year stood at ₹19,959 crore, which enabled the State to secure the third place across States in terms of quantum. In terms of number of projects, the State secured first place with 287.

Speaking to The Hindu, Major Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar said the government has cleared investments entailing ₹22,000 crore in August-September. During January-July 2020, total fresh investments in the country stood at ₹2.87 lakh crore and Karnataka alone bagged 1.16 lakh crore investments, constituting 40% of the total investments, Mr. Shettar said.

He attributed it to measures such as amendments to 18-year-old Karnataka Industries (Facilitation) Act, new industrial policy and a host of other policy and administrative measures that made Karnataka ‘one of the attractive destinations’.

The changes in the Karnataka Industries (Facilitation) Act, 2002, provided temporary clearance to the manufacturing industry to establish industry and commence commercial operation, giving a three-year window to obtain all clearances.

Besides investments in and around Bengaluru, many industrial areas in the north Karnataka region have been attracting investments. A recent State High Level Clearance Committee (SHLCC) meeting has cleared ₹3,540 crore investment of Aequs SEZ Private Limited to develop a consumer electronic and durable goods cluster in Dharwad. This would be the first sector-specific investment in line with the Narendra Modi-led government’s Atmanirbhar initiative, Mr. Shettar said.

Balasubramaniam, founder and chairman of GRAAM, Mysuru, as a member of the Technical Group on Social Stock Exchange (SSE). The committee has been formed to develop guidelines for setting up the Social Stock Exchange in India.

The group will also prescribe disclosure requirements relating to performance and highlight the aspects related to social impact and social audit. Dr. Balasubramaniam’s membership is with effect from October 7.

The committee is chaired by Harsh Kumar Bhanwala, former chairman, NABARD. The decision for setting up the technical group was taken following the recommendation of the working group on SSE. Earlier, the working group, chaired by Ishaat Hussain, had submitted its report on June 1, a release from GRAAM said here.

The working group outlined its vision and made high-level recommendations that included participation of non-profit organisations (NPOs) and for-profit enterprises (FPEs) on social stock exchanges, subject to committing to minimum reporting requirements.

“We strongly feel that the induction of Dr. Balasubramaniam, who founded the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM), will strengthen the committee with his vast experience of building, developing and managing organisations working in the not-for-profit sector, besides the development sector experience with studying and teaching at the world’s leading schools of policy and development, including Harvard and Cornell universities. He has also been a special investigator for Karnataka Lokayukta, in addition to holding membership and consulting positions in government bodies and commissions, academic boards and development agencies, including the World Bank,” said GRAAM executive director Basavaraj R.

Bhyrappa was on Saturday conferred the prestigious Dr. Kota Shivaram Karanth Huttoora Prashasti-2020 at a function here. The award has been presented in memory of the late Jnanpith award winner Kota Shivaram Karanth annually since 2005.

Minister in charge of Mysuru S.T. Somashekar, MP for Mysuru Pratap Simha, MLA L. Nagendra, Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, and representatives from Kota, Udupi district, were present.

140,2020/10/11,Over 7.6 lakh COVID-19 tests done over a week in Karnataka,"Karnataka, which has been testing over one lakh samples daily for the past four days, conducted a record 1,12,770 tests in a 24-hour period that ended on Saturday. This included 64,367 RT-PCR tests.

With this, the total number of tests touched 58,52,300 on Saturday. In the past one week alone, Karnataka has done 7,62,570 tests, which is almost equal to the total number of tests done till July.

The State’s COVID-19 tests breached the 50 lakh mark on October 2. From an average of 80 tests a day in March, the daily tests have crossed an average of 90,000 since October 5.

In fact, the State ramped up its testing from May onwards. From 1,587 tests in March, Karnataka conducted 3,21,115 tests till June. This further rose to 7,65,945 in July and more than doubled in August with 15,93,892. The number went up to 20,18,194 in September. The tests per million went up from 44,099 on September 1, and to 72,541 on September 30.

Karnataka started conducting Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) with one sample in June. This number rose to 1,68,472 samples in July, 7,24,469 in August, and 9,13,158 in September.

Scope for improvement

However, despite the high number of samples tested, experts say the State’s testing is yet to match the velocity of the virus. The Test Positivity Rate (TPR) on September 30 marginally increased to 12.3% from 11.8% on September 1. As on Saturday, the TPR stood at 9.32%.

According to epidemiologists, a high TPR indicates that testing is relatively limited to people with high suspicion of COVID-19 and may miss new chains of transmission in the community. “It would have made a big difference if the State had achieved the current rate of testing one or two months ago,” said a senior doctor.

Total cases breach 7 lakh

The total number of cases in the State breached the seven lakh mark on Saturday. Continuing to report over 10,000 cases for the fourth consecutive day, the State witnessed 10,517 new cases. With this, the total number of cases hit 7,00786.

With 102 new deaths, the toll rose to 9,891.This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths.

As many as 8,337 persons were discharged on Saturday, taking the total number of recoveries to 5,69,947. Active cases continued to remain over one lakh at 1,20,929. Bengaluru Urban reported 4,563 cases, taking its tally to 2,76,934.

143,2020/10/11,Council election: ‘JD(S) will seek votes on work done’,"Former Minister and JD(S) leader Basavaraj Horatti has said that it was during the tenure of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy that more steps were taken to help graduates and address issues concerning teachers and youths, and on this basis they would seek votes in the council election.

Addressing presspersons along with JD(S) national general secretary N.H. Konaraddi, other office bearers Gururaj Hunasimarad and Rajanna Koravi, Mr. Horatti said unlike the other candidates in the council election, the JD(S) would be seeking votes on its work and was ready to answer all the queries of the voters.

“We have documents on what we did for teachers and graduates, on the recruitment that we conducted, grants extended to educational institutions, and various agitations for the sake of graduates and teachers. What happened to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of two crore jobs? What has the BJP done for teachers and graduates? Let them come for an open debate, we will participate with all the documents,” he said.

Mr. Horatti admitted that there was a lack of interest among the graduate voters to enrol themselves in the voters’ list because of which there were just over 92,000 voters in the constituency although graduates in the region exceeded four lakh.

On the election plan, he said the party had set up district committees and zone committees to take up canvassing. “Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, the election strategy will be changed and one-to-one contact will be made to appeal for votes. Other modes of communication to reach out to the electorate will also be done,” he said, adding that considering the work done by the party, they were canvassing with the hope of a win.

Mr. Konaraddi said JD(S) had given ticket to party workers and would seek votes based on its work. Although the BJP, the Congress and other parties had made promises, it was only JD(S) which had addressed the problems of teachers and graduates, he said.

JD(S) candidate for Karnataka West Graduates’ Constituency Shivashankar Kallaur said voters were disappointed with present MLC S.V. Sankanur who was seeking re-election. “In the last six years, he has done nothing for the graduates except giving memoranda. He has failed to meet the expectations and that’s the reason the voters have now launched the campaign to oust Prof. Sankanur,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rxhpri/article32823933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGELECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/council-election-jds-will-seek-votes-on-work-done/article32823934.ece
144,2020/10/11,BJP denies irregularities in projects taken up under Smart City Mission,"The BJP on Saturday refuted allegations made by Ivan D’Souza, former MLC, that there was large-scale irregularities in the projects taken up in the city under the Smart City Mission.

Addressing presspersons, general secretary of the BJP Dakshina Kannada unit Sudhir Shetty Kannur denied that there was threefold increase in the estimated cost of the projects.

He said the costs had been estimated as per the scheduled rate fixed by the Public Works Department. He said the Managing Director of Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. enjoyed powers to sanction projects costing up to ₹5 crore. The high-power committee of the government approved projects costing above ₹5 crore and upto ₹50 crore. Projects costing ₹200 crore and above will have to be approved by the Cabinet. All estimates under the mission will have to be approved by the Board of the company.

Mr. Shetty said that 60% estimates of the projects taken up under the mission had been made in the last two-and-half years under the Congress regime when it was leading the city corporation council. The Congress had only decided on the projects to be taken up under area based development in eight wards. As Mr. D’Souza, at a press conference on Thursday, had sought an enquiry by the Anti Corruption Bureau or Lokayukta into the alleged irregularities, the BJP welcomes it as the projects got underway during the Congress regime.

He said the projects were under progress in eight wards.

Premananda Shetty, Whip in the council led by the BJP, said the projects had got a fillip since a year. The detailed project report for river front development is being prepared now. The BJP has not sidelined this project, he said.

Housing project

Referring to the housing project proposed near Shakthi Nagar for the poor, Mr. Shetty said the corporation has taken steps to deposit ₹60 lakh with the Forest Department to remove trees in the project site and compensatory afforestation in 20 acres of land reserved for compensatory afforestation in Tenka Edapadavu village.

The “goof up” done by the Congress by not following the due procedures of a housing project has now forced the present administration to re-invite bids to take up construction of houses under the same project, Mr. Shetty alleged.

BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel has said that the decision on the candidature for byelection to the Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency would be taken after the announcement of the date of polls.

Speaking to presspersons in Belagavi on Saturday, Mr. Kateel said he was touring the State in the wake of forthcoming elections to gram panchayats and bypolls of vacant seats of Legislative Assembly and the Lok Sabha.

“I am touring the State to make organisational preparations for the forthcoming elections.

We are confident that the BJP win all the bypolls,” he said.

Mr. Kateel said that steps were being taken to further strengthen the party and extend its base from the booth level and accordingly, directions had been given to the party workers.

Regarding the reopening of schools and colleges in the State, he said a discussion in this regard had begun and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa too had already clarified that a decision would be taken by the Minister for Primary and Secondary Education in consultation with educationalists, teachers, and parents.

147,2020/10/11,Merge all four State road transport corporations and save public money: Anantha Subba Rao,"President of KSRTC Staff and Workers Federation H.V. Anantha Subba Rrao has said that instead of unnecessarily spending crores on establishment costs through four State road transport corporations, the government should merge them and save public money.

Addressing presspersons here on Saturday, Mr. Rao said over two decades ago the State government carved out four transport corporations out of the existing one corporation, and during this period the decision had only resulted in increasing more establishment cost and cumulative loss.

“From around ₹300 crore from a single transport corporation, the cumulative loss had now mounted to ₹2,317 crore from the four transport corporations. With the creation of new transport corporations, additional posts were created including those of managing directors, chairpersons and others, and money was spent on regional offices. When everything could be done through a single corporation, best solution was to merge the corporations,” he said.

Mr. Rao alleged that the State government was forcing the employees of the State road transport corporations to take the path of agitation by being apathetic towards their demands.

He said that despite its own directions on full payment to workers during the pandemic period, the employees of the State transport corporations were not being paid properly and allowances, incentives and other facilities were being cut.

“Our other main demand is that as the transport corporations are not meant for making profit and are for serving the people, the government should pay the salary grants to these corporations. Initially, the government paid full salaries to employees and now only 70% was being paid till September,” he said.

He alleged that as the government had only paid 70% and asked the transport corporations to mobilise funds for the remaining 30%, the officials were finding new methods to deprive employees of their rightful wages and some were being forced to go on leave. Because of non-availability of funds, the transport corporations were unable to pay even the Provident Fund contributions and gratuity dues, he said.

“We have submitted our list of demands repeatedly and sought appointment to meet the Minister. However, the government is not ready to even listen to us. We are being forced to go for strike and we will go ahead with it, if our demands are not heard,” he said.

General strike

General Secretary of the federation D.A. Vijaya Bhaskar said the present government was trying to snub the trade unions and the voice of the farmers being raised for their rightful demands. The Joint Committee of Trade Unions had given a call for national strike on November 26 to condemn the anti-labour and anti-farmer policies of the Centre and preparations were on, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lxcygj/article32823910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGKSRTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/merge-all-four-state-road-transport-corporations-and-save-public-money-anantha-subba-rao/article32823912.ece

149,2020/10/11,Kudumbashree opens 12 Kerala Chicken outlets,"50 outlets will be opened as part of 100-day action plan

Twelve of the 50 Kerala Chicken outlets targeted by the Kudumbashree as part of the government’s 100-day action plan have been launched in the State.

Ten of these outlets are in Ernakulam, and two in Thrissur district. Agreements have been signed to open six more outlets in Ernakulam. These are expected to become functional in a couple of weeks.

The outlets in the two districts are supplied by 36 farms in Ernakulam district. Farms are set to open soon in Thrissur.

To Kottayam

Once the target of 20 outlets in Ernakulam is achieved and the Thrissur operations start expanding, the Kudumbashree will turn its attention to Kottayam where 10 outlets are scheduled to be opened.

The first outlet of the Kerala Chicken was launched in Ernakulam at the end of June. The Kudumbashree had rolled out the project so that half the chicken sold in the State could be produced here.

How the model works

The Kudumbashree has adopted the integration model for Kerala Chicken. It supplies the chicks, feed, and medicines, while the farmer has to ensure a shed for the birds, electricity and water charges, and labour charges, if any. The space should be enough to accommodate a minimum of 1,000 birds. Most of the farmers are from the Kudumbashree network. Besides individual farmers, joint enterprises can also be launched. More chicks will be supplied to such ventures.

Supervisors visit farms every day to ensure that parameters such as quality of chicks, feed intake, and proper vaccination are met.

The supply of chicks to farms depends on the demand at the outlet, which is ascertained after a study.

After the 40-45 days in which the chicks mature and are taken back by the Kudumbashree, the farms are left vacant for 15 days for cleaning and sanitising before they are allotted the next batch.

Farmers’ income

Payment to the farmers is based on the feed conversion rate (feed consumed divided by weight of the bird). While farmers usually receive ₹7 for a kg of the bird, Kerala Chicken farmers will get up to ₹13 for a kg depending on quality. At ₹10 for a bird, a farmer with 1,000 birds will earn approximately ₹19,000 over these 40 or 45 days, say Kudumbashree officials.

Loans are provided by the Kudumbashree at 4% interest for setting up sheds for the chicks. After these three districts, operations will be expanded to other districts too.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/12-kerala-chicken-outlets-opened/article32829057.ece

152,2020/10/11,"Kathakali shifts to virtual stage, adulation follows","Past three months have seen good response to live performances on social media

The Attavilakku, the lamp used during Kathakali performances, was not lit for six months anywhere in the State.

This was the largest gap in the history of the art form and the repercussions were tragic.

And when it was rekindled by the end of June 2020, it marked a new beginning for the art form that brought name and fame besides tourists to Kerala.

The first ever online live performance of Kathakali was hosted by Kozhikode-based Thodayam Kathakali Yogam.

‘Duryodhana Vadham,’ performed by artistes, including Kottakkal Devadas and Kalamandalam Hari R. Nair, on June 28 was viewed by over 15,000 people on Facebook.

Main performers

It was just a beginning. The path pointed out by Thodayam was later adapted by patrons of Kathakali across the State, as a result of which several online performances were streamed on social media platforms and YouTube over the last three months. These include ‘Kalyana Sougandhikam’ at Paliyekkara, Thrissur; ‘Kirmeeravadham’ by Vazhenkada Kunju Nair Memorial Trust, Karalmanna, ‘Poothanamoksham’ by Gandhi Seva Sadanam, Perur, ‘Purappadu’ at Killikkurissimangalam, all in Palakkad; ‘Seetha Swayamvaram’ at Thiruvalla, Pathanamthitta, and ‘Rugmangada Charitham’ at Cheruthuruthy, Thrissur, and a dozen other performances.

‘Give them stages’

During and soon after the lockdown, the Kathakali artistes, allied performers and backstage artistes were facing loss of livelihood. The patronising organisations tried to support them through financial aid.

“These artistes are very proud and do not want to accept such help. So the best way to support them was to provide them stages and to remunerate them for the performances,” said Sreejith Menon, secretary of Thodayam Kathakali Yogam, which later on organised a seven-hour-long performance of ‘Nalacharitham 2nd Day.’ The Nalacharitham performance was based on the lyrics by veteran artiste Kalamandalam Gopi. It was watched live by over 10,000 enthusiasts. “We are proud that we could revive the Kathakali stages in such a period of crisis. We are exploring newer ways to reach out to our audiences,” Mr. Menon added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2d5b88/article32829013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KALAMANDALAM-GOPI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kathakali-shifts-to-virtual-stage-adulation-follows/article32829014.ece
153,2020/10/11,Managing surge capacity is the new challenge,"As cases mount, not all districts are well-placed to manage patients requiring ICU care or ventilator support

As it is becoming more evident that the State would be fighting the COVID-19 pandemic for many more weeks or months, the entire focus of the health administration is now on managing the surge capacity in districts.

(Surge capacity generally refers to the ability of a health system to maintain a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of the system.)

The number of patients who are critically ill has spiked in all districts. However, not all districts are well-placed to manage the increasing number of patients requiring ICU care or ventilator support.

Though the private health sector has stepped in for COVID-19 management, even now, a clear picture of how many private hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators would be available for COVID-19 management in districts is not available.

A senior Health official said that private hospitals had been told to compulsorily set aside 10% of their beds for COVID-19 patients.

“It is not easy to create more ICU beds because it requires enormous human resources support. We need at least 36 staff nurses to run 10 ICU beds round the clock, which is unthinkable in the current situation,” he said. There are not enough doctors also to put into service.

Category B patients

The focus is shifting to Category B patients now, who have more than mild symptoms, which might aggravate, because of various co-morbidities like diabetes or their immuno compromised state.

“The attempt is to manage Category B patients well so that their condition does not worsen, requiring ICU care/ventilator support. In all districts, district authorities have been asked to take over small and medium hospitals to create COVID-19 second line treatment centres where high flow nasal oxygen facilities to give supplemental oxygen to patients, and physicians would be available round the clock,” he said.

District wise

As for districts, Thiruvananthapuram, which has some 1,200 beds with oxygen support (including 397 ICU beds) and 360 ventilators, is one of the best-equipped districts and is expected to manage COVID-19 very well. Case graph does show signs of plateauing but the high daily caseload of around 900-1,000 cases is extremely worrisome as the hospital stay for every patient is an average of 10 days.

Kozhikode and Ernakulam are expected to do fine because of the strong presence of private hospitals. But Kozhikode already has a high caseload and it will also have to bear part of the load of Malappuram, which is mostly dependent just on Government Medical College Hospital, Manjeri, for critical-care patients.

Similarly, situation in Alappuzha and Kasaragod are also worrisome. Kollam (with 2,163 beds in all, and 246 oxygen supported beds, including 68 ICUs, 108 ventilators) is another problem district, which has been experiencing a surge and is leaning heavily on Thiruvananthapuram for providing critical-care support.

There are District Programme Management Support Units in every district, which are supposed to have a daily dashboard with real-time monitoring of hospital beds/ICU occupancies. However, there are inherent problems of reporting from hospitals and hence the functioning of these control rooms have not exactly been perfect, it is pointed out.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/sn75t7/article32055801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/managing-surge-capacity-is-the-new-challenge/article32829000.ece

Sumit Kumar Singh, the first accused, opened the console in 5Q Ring of the IAC and studied about the hardware available in it and took away the critical components such as 256 GB solid state drives, processors and 4GB RAM from the console for monitory gain, according to prosecution.

She also submitted that the court should consider the young age, backward social circumstances and lack of knowledge regarding the seriousness of the crime they might have committed.

159,2020/10/11,Swapna’s statement galvanise Opposition,"Congress, BJP to resume anti-government protests

The Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have seized on a statement given by UAE gold smuggling case suspect Swapna Suresh to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to target Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and force his resignation on the charge of abetting economic offenders.

United Democratic Front (UDF) convener M.M. Hassan said on Sunday that the Opposition activists would stage protests at 420 centres across the State on Monday to spotlight Mr. Vijayan's ‘support’ for gold smugglers.

Mr. Hassan demanded the resignation of Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel for his alleged link to the international racket.

BJP State secretary K. Surendran said Swapna's deposition was an indictment of Mr. Vijayan. The BJP would intensify its protest for Mr. Vijayan's exit.

Swapna had contentiously claimed that Mr. Vijayan knew her personally and she had met him ""5 to 6 times"" along with former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister M. Sivasankar. She also stated Mr. Vijayan was aware of her ""controversial"" appointment to the State-run Space Park project.

The Congress and the BJP have sought to weaponise Swapna's averments against Mr. Vijayan.

It also seemed not lost on the Opposition parties that Mr. Sivasankar was scheduled to appear before the Customs in Kochi on Tuesday amidst intense speculation that the agency might arrest him. They have sought to use the relentless media coverage of his questioning to put the government on the back foot.

The meandering investigations into the gold smuggling case gave the impression that the probes were edging closer to higher-ups in government each passing day.

The CPI(M) has said the Congress and the BJP had put on a spin on Swapna's statement to target the administration and eclipse its achievements ahead of the local body elections. It felt that a section of the media had amplified the Opposition's propaganda war against the government.

Mr. Vijayan had clarified that he had become aware of Swapna’s appointment to the Space Park via a private consultancy only after the scandal broke. Such postings did not come to him for clearance.

Administration officials had interacted with Swapna in her official capacity as executive secretary to the UAE consulate general. The government was in the clear in the matter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/fb47pb/article32607668.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWAPNASURESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/swapnas-statement-galvanise-oppn/article32828066.ece

The Revenue Department acquired the land in which a resort and a camp under the ownership of Vellukunnel Jimmy Zakaria functioned at Anayirangal, near Munnar, on Sunday.

Devikulam Subcollector S. Prem Krishnan issued an order on October 7 to acquire the resort and land that were in encroached government property. They had found after verification that the title deed was forged. The order issued by the Subcollector directed Udumbanchola tehsildar to acquire the land.

On Sunday, the Devikulam Subcollector, Udumbanchola Land Assignment tehsildar Joseph and tehsildar Niju Kurian led the revenue team to acquire the resort and land. A notice board proclaiming it as government land was also erected there.

Mr Prem Krishnan told The Hindu that nearly five acres of land with tents and camping facilities was attached. The title deed of the land was under the tandaper (revenue record) issued to a land nearly half a km away.

A report by the Subcollector stated that in total, three plots owned by Jimmy Zakkaria in Chinnakkanal, near Munnar, were forged. The other two lands would be acquired after verification by the survey team, said the Revenue officials.

The total acreage of the land would come to around 10 acres. Jimmy Sakaria was listed as a major encroacher as per the information given by the Devikulam Revenue Divisional Office.

161,2020/10/11,Al-Ameen to be revived in online form,"Newspaper was voice of freedom struggle in Malabar

Al-Ameen, a newspaper started by freedom fighter Mohammed Abdur Rahiman Sahib from Malabar in October 1924, is set to reincarnate in digital form. The revived version of the newspaper that had been the voice of the freedom struggle in Malabar will be available for online reading on websites and social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.

Although there were attempts to revive Al-Ameen earlier, financial constraints prevented the newspaper from taking off again. Veekshanam Mohammed, Malappuram district vice president of the Congress, said that the paper would not change or dilute its original editorial policies: that it stood for truth and for freedom. Mr. Mohammed will be the publisher of the newspaper.

Abdur Rahiman Sahib started Al-Ameen in October 1924 after his two-year jail term in the wake of the Malabar Mappila Rebellion, as he found that a newspaper was one of the strongest instruments to fight the tyranny of the British Raj. His paper mirrored the necessity of freedom and, therefore, had to face oppression by the British.

Sahib named his paper Al-Ameen (meaning honest) as he insisted that the content of the publication should be truthful. He took a firm stand against deporting freedom fighters to Andaman cellular jails and the enactment of Mappila Outrages Act.

Al-Ameen spoke against the British when some other newspapers kept silent during the Simon Commission period and Salt Satyagraha. When some detractors branded the paper as pro-Muslim, some others termed it as anti-Muslim. The publication ground to a halt in September 1939.

Sahib was jailed in 1940. Although he tried to revive it after his release in 1945, it did not take off. Sahib died on November 23, 1945.

Although Sahib’s friend Moidu Moulavi tried to revive it in 1946 and 1960, financial constraints burdened the publication. Moulavi’s sons V. Subair and M. Rasheed too tried to revive the paper, but without success.

Young teacher Bayis Kodur has assumed the editor’s post. District Congress secretary Ummer Gurikkal is the managing director.

Film personality P.T. Kunhumohammed and Mohammed Abdur Rahiman Sahib Trust chairman C. Haridas will jointly release the logo of Al-Ameen here on Monday, which will mark the 96th birthday of the newspaper.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4h302m/article32827792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-AL-AMEEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/al-ameen-to-be-revived-in-online-form/article32827793.ece
162,2020/10/11,A library that takes books to neo-literates,"Alappuzha library to foster reading culture among learners of various literacy courses

Eighty-year-old Clara of Mararikulam South in Alappuzha is all smiles after reading a few lines from a poem by Kunjunni Mash delivered to her from the Nava Saksharatha Library (library for the neo-literate).

The octogenarian is undergoing seventh standard equivalency course conducted by the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority (KSLMA). Apart from imbibing limited lessons from study material, neo-literates like Clara can now enrich their knowledge of history and culture by reading short stories, novels, poems and so on. Thanks to a programme launched by the Alappuzha district panchayat, which aims at improving reading skills and fostering the culture of reading among the neo-literates and learners.

2,000 books

As part of the initial phase of the programme, the district panchayat has bought 2,000 books and set up a ‘Nava Saksharatha Library’ at Njanapeedam Library, Kattoor. The books are delivered at the doorstep of the neo-literates and learners of various programmes of the KSLMA.

According to the district panchayat authorities, it is the first-of-its-kind initiative in the State. G. Venugopal, president, Alappuzha district panchayat, says the doorstep delivery of books will introduce hundreds of neo-literates into the world of reading without even travelling to get a book of their choice, especially during the COVID-19 times. “We are implementing this programme with the support of KSLMA to inculcate the culture of reading among neo-literates and those undergoing various equivalency courses and other programmes. It will provide people with the joyous experience of reading. Normally, elderly people are reluctant to go to libraries. Here, preraks and instructors of the KSLMA will reach out to the learners with books every week,” Mr. Venugopal says.

Reviews too

Besides reading books, the learners also need to review the books they read. “Neo-literates have fragile levels of literacy. Apart from textbooks, reading books such as stories will sharpen their reading skills. It will provide them with a whole new experience, which they have not experienced until now,” says an official.

Books from the Nava Saksharatha Library will be delivered in Mararikulam South, Mannancherry, Aryad and Muhamma grama panchayats under the Aryad block. There are more than 700 learners there. District panchayat officials say such libraries will be opened in other blocks in the district in a phased manner.

163,2020/10/11,"Special Bench to monitor trials against MLAs, MPs","Courts will try to complete trial in such cases in a year, HC tells SC

A special Bench of the Kerala High Court headed by the Chief Justice will monitor the progress of the trial of cases involving legislators. Steps for the urgent listing of 12 cases pending before the High Court at appropriate Benches will also be undertaken, the High Court has informed the Supreme Court.

The courts considering cases against law-makers, both present and former, would strive to complete the trial within one year. In the State, 324 such cases are pending in various courts. The principal sessions court and a magistrate court in each district trying such cases would be designated as special courts for the purpose, according to an action plan submitted by the High Court to the Supreme Court recently.

Sole special court

Currently, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate’s Court, Ernakulam, is the only special court in the State exclusively trying cases against MPs and MLAs.

As many as 298 such cases are pending before the magistrate courts in the State with Thiruvananthapuram topping the list (89 cases). Three cases tried by sessions courts were stayed by the High Court. Six cases were booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act against the law-makers. One case was pending before the CBI Court. Directions will be issued to expedite the proceedings and complete the trial by adhering to the apex court guidelines, the High Court submitted.

In two years

In Thiruvananthapuram, one Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court and two Judicial First Class Magistrate Courts may be designated as special courts considering the pendency of cases. A minimum tenure of two years would be sufficient to clear the pendency of cases. It has been estimated that each sessions judge can dispose of 15 cases a year and each magistrate, 50 cases a year.

Barring the cases before the Vigilance and CBI courts, all other pending cases involved offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code. The cases pending in the magistrate courts were not of serious nature, it was submitted.

A full portrait of Raja Kesava Das, pier and lighthouse at Alappuzha Port, scenes from the paddy fields of Kuttanad, coir rope-making, snakeboat race, and Kathakali art form among others now adorn the seven pillars and walls of the school.

According to Jinu George, a drawing teacher at SDV Boys School and the artist behind the paintings, it is an artistic tribute to Raja Kesava Das, the Dewan of Travancore and the founding father of Alappuzha Town.

It took more than 117 days for Mr. Jinu to finish a total of 10 pictures. Acrylic paint and enamel were used and paintings were done with knife and brush. The paintings cover an area of more than 600 sq ft. Besides, quotes from famous personalities like Mahatma Gandhi, Steve Jobs, Gautama Buddha, Kunjunni Mash and so on are also displayed prominently.

Mr. Jinu says he undertook the task to overcome the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and uphold human spirit and hope. Earlier, the inspiration for the work came from S. Ramanand, manager of SDV Schools. A. Sivasubramaniam and other members of the school management supported the idea.

167,2020/10/11,Cashew industry struggling to stay afloat,"Consumption and supply take a massive hit due to COVID-19 pandemic

Usually it is the season when sales skyrocket due to the demand of Navratri and Diwali markets. But with both consumption and supply taking a massive hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the future of cashew industry hangs in the balance.

More than 400 processing units in the State have downed shutters since lockdown, rendering thousands of skilled labourers jobless and their employers under tremendous pressure. While there has been a progressive slowdown in consumption, small and mid-level entrepreneur are finding it increasingly difficult to tide over the revenue dip.

“Both international and domestic markets are down. Export volume has hit an all-time low and domestic sales have plummeted due to the absence of tourists, pilgrims, large-scale festivals and events. Nearly 80% of the factories are not operating and most of the processors have hit rock bottom. The price of most moving items such as splits and grade 320 has also come down,” said Nizamudeen I., president, Federation of Cashew Processors and Exporters.

While the Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation (KSCDC) had a record sale of ₹5.5 crore during last Onam, this year they could not reach anywhere near the figure. “Since COVID-19 cases are expected to peak in the coming days, it is not possible for the market to recover any time soon. If we are not able to sell, there will be product pile up and the labourers will get fewer working days,” said KSCDC chairman S. Jayamohan.

The corporation had procured 2,000 tonnes of best quality RCN from the local farms in Kannur and Kasaragod at a higher price during the lockdown to operate the factories during Onam. The KSCDC is expecting 2,500 MT of RCN from Guinea-Bissau by October 25 so that the government-run factories can continue processing.

“The KSCDC and Capex will continue processing in order to protect the labourers. The situation is very complex and we will incur a loss, but we cannot deny the labourers their livelihood and other benefits,” he said. The procurement of cashew apple was also hit due to the pandemic and resultant protocol, affecting the production of value-added products.

According to private processors, they are in dire straits with most of them facing revenue recovery procedures due to the default in interest payments. With COVID-19 aggravating the crisis in the sector one more processor had ended his life recently.

“In the last couple of years, a total of five processors have committed suicide due to the crisis. Though a revival package was announced, it was sabotaged by the banks. They close the door at us, and both the Centre and State governments have failed to notice our plight,” said Shikar A.M., processor and secretary of Cashew Industry Protection Council.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/yqcq22/article32829074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12tvko-Cashew-Shelling-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cashew-industry-struggling-to-stay-afloat/article32827524.ece
168,2020/10/11,Elephant case: forest officials in the dock,"They connived with the accused to forge documents

After the elephant owners, two forest officials of Kerala are facing legal action for “conniving with the accused” in a case related to “forging of documents, illicit transaction of elephants and contempt of court.”

The Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW), Kerala, has initiated action against the Deputy Conservator of Forests, Social Forestry Division, Thiruvananthapuram, and the Range Officer for the “serious disobedience of the directions from the higher-ups” in the case related to A.V. Prasanth, an elephant owner, who allegedly transported an elephant.

Incidentally, the Principal Secretary (Forest) had stalled the actions against Mr. Prasanth and V. Shaji of Kollam and a few others for illegally transporting and trading captive elephants in violation of the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and Captive Elephants Management Rules.

Besides booking case against them, the department had also seized 15 elephants, who were in the possession of Mr. Shaji and others. The Hindu had reported that the government had asked the CWW to conduct an inquiry into the complaint of the association of elephant owners that the animal owners were harassed by the forest officials.

The two officials, according to a communication issued by the CWW, were asked to report the actions taken in the case within seven days. The Range Forest Officer was summoned to the office and instructed to take action against Mr. Prasanth for the illegal transfer of the elephant, Sankaranayarayan.

After the reminders and repeated oral directions, a case was booked. However, “no further investigation has been made and the accused has not been arrested and produced before the court,” the CWW noted.

The CWW also reported that the action of the officials amounted to “serious disobedience of directions issued by the higher-ups, serious dereliction of duty and their connivance with the accused in the case.”

Responding to the developments, Y.M. Shajikumar, the Deputy Conservator, said he was yet to get any communication in this regard. There were no lapses in the investigation and all possible and legal efforts were made to arrest the accused. Mr. Prasanth could not be arrested as his house was found closed, he said.

He felt that he was being victimised and someone was taking vengeance on him.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/elephant-case-forest-officials-in-the-dock/article32827480.ece
169,2020/10/11,"Tourist destinations, except beaches, to open today","Two-phase opening up of tourism sector adhering to COVID-19 protocols

Enabling the revival of the tourism industry, all tourist destinations in the State, except beaches, will be open for visitors and domestic tourists from Monday after remaining closed for over six months owing to restrictions to contain COVID-19.

Advancing the plan to open up the sector in a staggered manner by three days in the wake of the arrival of visitors to Wayanad and other places, the government has allowed visitors and domestic tourists to the hill stations, adventure tourism centres, Ayurveda centres, and backwater destinations. Houseboats, safari, and speed boats will also be available for tourists from Monday.

The government has issued orders for the two-phase opening up of the tourism sector adhering to COVID-19 protocols. Visitors and domestic tourists will be allowed at beach destinations only in Phase II, beginning on November 1.

Guidelines

All domestic tourists will have to register on www.covid19jagratha.kerala.nic.in and will have to follow the COVID-19 protocols. Those showing symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection should not travel to the State. Domestic tourists will have to wear masks, ensure physical distancing of two metres, and use sanitisers while in the State.

Domestic tourists coming to the State for trips lasting up to seven days need not undergo quarantine. Those planning for holidaying in the State for more than seven days should come with a COVID-19 negative certificate or undergo a test immediately on reaching the State. Those domestic tourists who fail to do so will have to undergo seven days’ quarantine.

Minister for Tourism Kadakampally Surendran said on Sunday that the decision to open up the sector has been taken to alleviate the misery faced by the stakeholders, in line with the steps taken by other States. Besides, tourism did not figure in the sectors banned in the Unlock 4 order of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs and it was assessed to be what was needed for the revival of the industry.

The government has also detailed the steps to be followed at the tourist destinations to check the spread of the pandemic. Thermal scanners will have to be used to check the body temperature and details of the visitors should be recorded. The Deputy Director and Secretaries of the District Tourism Promotion Councils have been asked to ensure that COVID-19 protocols are followed at tourism destinations.

The reservation of rooms and entry in adventure tourism centres should be through online booking, the government has suggested. The Minister hoped that domestic tourists will come forward to the State without fear.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/37nr77/article32817374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvwycamelhumpmountaincomplex,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tourist-destinations-except-beaches-to-open-today/article32827434.ece

171,2020/10/11,NCP and KC(M) tussle over Pala,"KC(M) yet to announce its political stance on LDF entry

The proposed association of the Kerala Congress (M) led by Jose K. Mani with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) appears to have hit a major blockade with the regional party now coming face to face with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) over the Pala Assembly constituency.

Addressing media persons here on Sunday, NCP leader and Pala MLA Mani C. Kappan asserted that the KC(M) held no emotional connections with the seat as was often touted. “If Pala was Mani (K.M. Mani) sir's wife, she has become my heart now. The mandate that its voters has given to me is not for exchange, not even for a Rajya Sabha seat,” Mr. Kappan said.

According to him, the NCP national leadership has decided not to hand over any of its seats, be it Pala, Kuttanad or Elathur, to anyone for anything. Regarding the proposed entry of the KC(M) faction to the LDF, he said the matter was yet to come up for a discussion in the LDF forum.

Mr. Kappan, who had unsuccessfully contested in Pala against K.M. Mani for three times on a trot, rode on his popularity and the raging factional fight within the KC(M) to emerge victorious during the byelection last year. The election had been necessitated by the death of K.M. Mani.

Responding to Mr. Kappan's statement, Jose K. Mani said more than just a name, Pala was a feeling as far as the KC(M) was concerned. He, however, termed the ongoing debates over the seat as hypothetical and said the party would come clean about its plans sooner than later.

“We would like not to respond to such discussions for the time being as the KC(M) is yet to announce its political stance, which can be expected in a matter of days,” Mr. Mani said.

N. Jayaraj, MLA, another leader with the Mani group, had earlier stated that Pala formed the core of the KC(M) politics. “Irrespective of the coalition that we are going to associate with, Pala should be with us. That's a matter of priority,” he told media persons.

Meanwhile, official source said the CPI(M), the lead partner in the LDF, had been working behind the scenes to sort out the issue at the earliest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ncp-and-kcm-tussle-over-pala/article32827391.ece
172,2020/10/11,Govt. scraps 2014 order on inter-State water disputes,"Modified guidelines issued following a HC ruling

The Water Resources Department has scrapped a 2014 order which sought to prevent the release of information regarding inter-State water disputes under the Right to Information Act.

The department has now issued modified guidelines on the matter following a High Court ruling in 2019 which frowned upon the attempt to prevent flow of information under RTI.

Through a July 22, 2014, order, the department had decided not to give out information on inter-State water issues under RTI on the ground that it could adversely impact the State's interests, given the disputes with neighbouring States.

According to the order, such information was to be withheld until the cases pending in the Supreme Court and other courts were settled.

However, the High Court, in a June 25, 2019, ruling observed that the department's decision cannot be allowed to influence state information officers/appellate authorities. These officers should be governed exclusively by the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005, the court noted.

In the light of the court ruling, the Chief Engineer (Inter State Water) of the Irrigation Department had sought suitable directions from the government.

In an October 1 order, the State government cancelled the 2014 order and noted that information officers should handle queries on inter-State water issues as per the provisions of the RTI Act, 2005.

The Chief Ministers of Kerala and Tamil Nadu had met on September 25, 2019, to sort out issues related to inter-State water sharing and the revision of the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project agreement. Subsequently, the two States had formed joint committees to carry forward the discussions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-scraps-2014-order-on-inter-state-water-disputes/article32827208.ece

The recent State government order on reservation for the differently abled in government jobs is facing protests from the hearing impaired as they claim that a large number of them have been excluded from jobs citing technical reasons.

The order dated August 25, 2020, offering 4% reservation for people from various categories of differently abled in common category posts in government offices is being questioned by the All Kerala Association of the Deaf (AKAD) on grounds that it has violated the tenets of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016 by denying jobs to people who are completely deaf.

V.A. Yusuf, State chairman of Deaf Employees Forum and State secretary of AKAD, said people who were 70% to 100% hearing impaired were not qualified for any of the jobs listed under the order. He alleged that the order deemed mandatory for the hearing impaired to be able to function normally with the help of hearing aids or cochlear implants to be found qualified for the jobs. “The completely deaf have not been allotted any jobs, not even that of a sweeper. A lot of completely deaf people are doing several government jobs efficiently at present, while the same jobs are being denied to them through this order,” said Mr. Yusuf.

The RPWD Act had maintained that sign language should be popularised to help the deaf be part of mainstream society.

176,2020/10/11,Call for State law on minimum farm prices,"Opposition to move Supreme Court against new Central farm laws

The State government should bring in legislation to guarantee minimum support price to farmers for their agricultural produce, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said on Saturday.

Addressing a farmers’ meet organised by the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, Mr. Chennithala said the Opposition would move the Supreme Court against the contentious farm laws introduced by the Centre. The opening up of the sector to corporates will adversely impact food production and the future of farmers, he said.

Inaugurating the meet, All India Congress Committee general secretary Tariq Anwar said the Congress would continue its struggle until the farm laws are withdrawn.

The Narendra Modi government passed the Bills in Parliament without taking farmers into confidence. The Prime Minister did not discuss the Bills with farmer organisations or political parties. The Central government was solely concerned about corporate interests in this matter, Mr. Anwar alleged.

In passing the farm laws, the Centre has struck at the very roots of federal principles, KPCC president Mullapally Ramachandran said. In its haste to get the Bills passed, ‘the Centre did not take Parliament into confidence or follow its procedures,’ Mr. Ramachandran said.

Minimum support price would have been guaranteed to farmers if the Centre had implemented the M. S. Swaminathan committee recommendation that the MSP should be fixed at 50% more than the weighted average of the production cost, Mr. Ramachandran said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/7tt6v9/article32824299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kisan2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/call-for-state-law-on-minimum-farm-prices/article32824289.ece

The city Corporation found a place among the local bodies that were accorded the ‘clean’ status on Saturday.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared ‘clean’ status for 501 grama panchayats and 58 municipalities, as part of the 100-day action plan.

Following the declaration through videoconference, Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran presented the award and the citation to Mayor K.Sreekumar at the Corporation office.

Mr.Surendran said that the achievements of the Corporation in implementing a robust decentralised waste management system after the closure of the centralised waste treatment plant at Vilappilsala is a model worth following.

The model has won accolades at the national and international levels.

Earth Day award

The Mayor said that the Corporation had also recently won the Earth Day Network Star Municipal Leadership Award, instituted by the Earth Day Network, a non-profit organisation which organises the annual observance of Earth Day. He said that the recognition from the State government as well as the other awards will spur the civic body for further efforts in this sphere.

The city Corporation, which was dependent on a centralised system till the closure of the Vilappilsala plant in 2011, made a shift to decentralised waste management systems, with the setting up of aerobic bins for community waste composting at the ward levels and by the distribution of kitchen bins for waste treatment at the household level.

Collection points were also opened for non-biodegradable waste.

These are taken to material recovery facilities, from where it is handed over to various agencies for recycling purposes.

The City Corporation also organises periodic collection of non-biodegradable waste. It has also set up a licensing system for septage waste collection and disposal, which has put an end to dumping of septage waste in water bodies and in public spaces.

In the district, 47 grama panchayats, five municipalities and five block panchayats were declared as clean.

Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ has said that students don’t need to spend dollars on education in foreign countries any more as the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) is in line with the global standards.

Addressing a webinar organised by IIT-Kharagpur on Saturday evening, Mr. Pokhriyal said the country has a robust education system and quality research facilities.

“There is no need for some of our students to enroll in foreign universities, spending dollars on admission. We have all the infrastructure and facilities. The National Education Policy 2020 has further taken care of the issue. Our students will stay and study in the country now,” he said.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited foreign universities to set up campuses in India and encouraged Indian universities to build overseas campuses so that students are motivated to stay in India and study India,” he added.

The Minister said the credit bank system in the National Education Policy is in accordance with global education programmes.

“The credit bank system enables students to take a break from academic programmes, thus awarding certificates, diplomas and degrees,” he said.

Mr. Pokhriyal expressed hope that the digital platforms developed under various educational initiatives of the government since 2014 would help strengthen the countrys higher education system in sync with international practices.

180,2020/10/11,"Stamp duty, registration fees collection up in Tamil Nadu","Property sale strong in two months

Tamil Nadu’s revenue from stamp duty and registration fees was ₹1,064.62 crore in September this year, a tad higher than ₹1,056.17 crore in the same month last year.

This is the second straight month of positive growth since the lockdown was imposed to curb COVID-19 in mid-March, indicating a rebound in the demand for property.

In August this year, the revenue from stamp duty and registration fees rose to ₹792.65 crore from ₹786.84 crore in the same period last year, according to the data from the Department of Registration.

In April this year, the revenue from stamp duty and registration fees had tanked almost 97% to ₹23.61 crore from ₹761.81 crore in April 2019, amid the total lockdown.

The declining trend continued in May, June and July. The revenue growth from stamp duty and registration fees is the proxy to real estate demand.

A senior official said the property demand had come back strongly in August and September.

“There was a pent-up demand amid the complete lockdown in April and May, which brought activities to a stand still. With the number of relaxations allowed and more number of auspicious days, the revenue has been positive in August and September [when the e-pass system for inter-district travel was scrapped],” officials of the Department of Registration said.

The number of documents registered increased to 2,98,956 in September this year from 2,38,978 in the same period last year. In August this year, the number of documents registered rose to 2,17,070 from 2,00,649 in the same period last year.

Sanjay Chugh, city head-Chennai, Anarock Property Consultants, said the reduction in interest rates for home loans and incentives offered by builders had helped to revive the property demand. “The pent-up demand is getting reflected now. With interest rates being lower and incentives from some quality builders in the market, it may be the right time to buy a house,” he said.

Sridharan, chairman of CREDAI, Tamil Nadu, said the demand had come back strongly. “The lockdown relaxations, especially the opening up on Sundays, have increased site visits. People who were waiting on the sidelines are now actively considering buying a house, and the inquiries have gone up significantly,” he said.

But he called for a reduction in the registration fee and stamp duty, which is at 11%.

CREDAI has made a representation to Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam (who holds the Housing portfolio) to bring down the registration fee and stamp duty to 6%, without any further change in the guideline value, which has already been reduced by 33%.

Mr. Sridharan pointed out that the reduction in the stamp duty had a positive impact in Maharashtra. “The reduction in the stamp duty will boost home-buying, as the benefit directly goes to the consumers. This will improve the volume of registration, which in turn will increase revenue to the government.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/6iqbwr/article32829990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STAMPDUTYjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stamp-duty-registration-fees-collection-up-in-tamil-nadu/article32829111.ece

Amarnath of Lalgudi said certain political parties claiming to be representatives of Pallar community made a strange request to the State government to alter the Presidential Order and to de-list Pallar, Kudumban, Devendrakulathan, Kadaiyan, Pannadi and Kalladi sub-sects from the Presidential Order and declare them Scheduled communities.

Acting on the request, the State government issued the GO, appointing the committee to study the demand. However, the move of the State was unconstitutional since Article 341 read with Article 162 of the Constitution clearly prohibited the State from exercising its executive power to alter or consider a plea for exclusion of the listed entries in the Presidential Order.

It was also a settled canon of constitutional jurisprudence that no person, who was entitled to a constitutional right or benefit, had the competence to waive or give away the benefit or status voluntarily, the petitioner said.

The GO sought to entrench into the exclusive legislative field occupied by Parliament and as such the action of the State was in violation of the federal system of constitutional governance, the petitioner argued.

The case will come up for hearing on Monday when the State will file its reply.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stay-go-on-studying-demand-for-grouping-de-listing-communities-madurai/article32827855.ece

Member of Parliament D. Ravikumar on Sunday alleged that the ruling AIADMK had no bona fide intentions to retrieve Panchami lands in the State and transfer it to Adi-dravidars as was evident in the lack of efforts over the years.

In a statement, Mr. Ravikumar said that the previous DMK government had constituted a committee headed by former Madras High Court Judge Maruthamuthu in 2011 to examine the various issues related to Panchami lands.

However, when the AIADMK government came into existence, the commission was dissolved.

However, on a subsequent writ petition filed in the Madras High Court, the AIADMK government formed a high-level committee in 2015 and it was anyone’s guess to know what happened to that committee also, Mr. Ravikumar said.

“The constitution of the high-level committee was thus only an ‘eyewash’ and this only showed that the AIADMK government was not interested in retrieving Panchami lands, which would be transferred to Dalits”, he said.

Raju that the AIADMK government was interested in the welfare of Dalits lacked truth and if it was true why were no steps taken to retrieve the lands, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rq4yyw/article31086187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THRAVIKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-govt-not-interested-in-retrieving-panchami-lands-says-villupuram-mp/article32826253.ece

187,2020/10/11,High Court issues guidelines for conducting property survey,"‘Officials should be held accountable for failure in their duty’

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has laid down guidelines for the authorities to follow while conducting property surveys. It also wanted government officials held accountable for failure in their duty while conducting these surveys.

Justice S. Vaidyanathan observed, “We are now in the era of global digitalisation and by use of advanced technology/machinery, the survey could be easily done so as to bring the issue to a logical conclusion to the satisfaction of both parties.”

The court said a survey or resurvey should be conducted within 30 days of receipt of charges, and the entire process should be photographed and videographed. In case of failure on the part of an official to conduct a survey, the cost of application should be returned to the parties, a sum of ₹2,500 should be recovered from the salary of the official and departmental proceedings should be initiated against him/her.

A register should be maintained with details such as the name of the person who has gone for the survey, the area of survey, the date of survey, the completion of survey, and the reason for not surveying the property. The facts should be verified by a superior officer.

Constant vigil

The judge said the details should be made available to the parties concerned or any person under the Right to Information Act. A constant vigil of officials of the Revenue Department was necessary to regulate revenue-related works, he said.

The district administration should use drone technology to conduct an accurate survey of properties, which would help to bring out encroachments on government land, the court said. Pendency of litigation would not bar the authorities from conducting a survey or resurvey in the absence of any stay or an interim order or an interim injunction, the judge said.

The judge said it was unfortunate that officials were demanding bribes even for doing their duties, and directed the State to issue a circular within a month, incorporating these guidelines.

The court was hearing a petition filed by Asaithambi of Madurai. Taking into account the delay in the conduct of a survey of the property involved, the court passed the guidelines.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gybhkn/article32824452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11MADURAIHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-issues-guidelines-for-conducting-property-survey/article32824453.ece

A 42-year-old man slipped while climbing the hill in Tiruvannamalai and died after hitting a rock on Saturday.

According to police, Anandraj, 42, from Villupuram, was a cashier in a nationalised bank in Tiruvannamalai and also a regular trekker.

On Saturday, he and 15 others climbed the hill through the path behind Ramana Ashramam.

“It is suspected that he collapsed half-way. The information was passed on to the police by the members [of the trekking group],” the police said.

The Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services personnel and Forest Department officials, along with the police, went up the hill and tried to take Anandraj to a hospital but in vain.

The body was sent to the government hospital for post-mortem examination.

Climbing not allowed

“We are in the process of registering a case against those who climbed the hill with him,” said a senior police officer.

Forest officers and the police said that climbing the hill was not allowed.

“We have installed caution boards everywhere, warning people not to climb the hill. Despite the warning, many continue to do so.

190,2020/10/11,"Panchayat secretary, ward member arrested in Cuddalore for forcing Dalit president to sit on floor","The Bhuvanagiri police on Saturday arrested Sinduja, secretary of the Therku Thittai panchayat in the Mel Bhuvanagiri block in Cuddalore, after it emerged that panchayat president Rajeshwari Saravana Kumar, from a Scheduled Caste, was forced to sit on the floor at panchayat meetings.

The police also arrested Sugumar, a caste Hindu and member of ward number 6.

Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav said Sugumar was arrested after an inquiry. He had also threatened Ms. Saravana Kumar at the panchayat meetings, he said.

Ms. Sinduja was earlier suspended by Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri following an inquiry.

A case was booked against Ms. Sinduja and panchayat vice-president Mohan Raj under Section 3 (1) (m) and (r) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Mohan Raj is at large, and the police have launched a search. Ms. Saravana Kumar spoke about the harassment and discrimination she had faced from caste Hindus, including Mohan Raj, after a photo of her sitting on the ground while other members were seated on chairs at a panchayat meeting went viral. The meeting was held in July.

Mr. Sakhamuri told The Hindu that the matter was brought to the notice of the administration on Friday. He said he would visit the panchayat, along with Mr. Sree Abhinav, for an inquiry.

The Therku Thittai panchayat has six ward members, including two belonging to the Adi Dravidar community, while the others are caste Hindus.

Alleging that she had been a victim of caste discrimination ever since she was elected as the president in January, Ms. Saravana Kumar said Mr. Mohan Raj and three other ward members did not allow her to function independently. “I was not allowed to hoist the national flag during the Republic Day in January. The panchayat vice-president said his father would hoist the flag instead. He and three other ward members, all caste Hindus, insulted me and forced me and the other Dalit ward member, Suganthi, to sit on the floor at meetings, while the rest sat on chairs,” she said.

Ms. Saravana Kumar alleged that she had not been allowed to occupy her seat at the panchayat office. This had happened at the last three meetings, and the reason they had cited was that an adequate number of chairs was not available, she said. In the larger interest of serving the people, she had been bearing with the insult and disrespect. “The situation has now reached a point where continued silence would only strengthen their attitude, and hence I have decided to speak out,” she said.

The panchayat meetings were convened only by the vice-president, who maintained that that “I am a woman and know nothing and should remain quiet,” she said. She said he had dared her to lodge a complaint with any authority, including the Collector. “He said the officials would be the least bothered,” she added.

A senior official said caste-based discrimination had been prevailing in the panchayat for some time. But he rejected her charge that she was not allowed to hoist the national flag on Republic Day. “The incident [in which she was forced to sit on the floor] happened a few months ago and the photo surfaced now... We directed the Assistant Director, Panchayats, to conduct an inquiry and lodged a complaint with the police to take action under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3smdvv/article32824243.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CUDDALORE-PANCHAYAT-DALIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dalit-panchayat-president-force-to-sit-on-floor-in-tamil-nadu-panchayat-secretary-ward-member-arrested/article32824244.ece
191,2020/10/11,Allies must accept CM candidate to remain in front: AIADMK,"Murugan had evaded questions on whether NDA would endorse Palaniswami’s candidature

Days after the AIADMK formalised Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its electoral face for 2021, its senior leaders on Saturday made it clear that only alliance parties who accept him as the Chief Ministerial candidate could be part of their front.

On Friday, BJP State president L. Murugan sidestepped questions on whether Mr. Palaniswami’s candidature would have the NDA’s endorsement as well.

AIADMK deputy coordinator K.P. Munusamy said the decision to project Mr. Palaniswami as the CM candidate was taken by party functionaries after consultations, and it was the party’s policy decision. “Only when political parties accept this, they can be in the alliance,” he told The Hindu.

When it was pointed out that some of AIADMK’s alliance parties had not welcomed the decision or had remained ambiguous in endorsing the decision, the Rajya Sabha MP said, “It is not important for us whether they welcome it or not.”

Citing the case of Bihar, where the BJP, despite being a national party, was supporting Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar as the alliance’s CM candidate for the Assembly poll, Mr. Munusamy reasoned, “When the alliance is headed by us, it is natural that the CM candidate will be from our party.”

Senior AIADMK leader and former MP A. Anwhar Raajhaa said one must understand what an alliance means in politics. “It is an electoral alliance formed to face an election and it is only for that election. The last agreement with the BJP was for the Parliamentary election and we did not formally seek their support for the bypolls in Nanguneri and Vikravandi constituencies but we won,” he pointed out.

Though the Central and State governments had been maintaining cordial ties, the alliance would be finalised only closer to the election.

Mr. Raajhaa said he had insisted that the party leadership not go for what he called a “minus alliance”. “Every party in an electoral alliance should help secure votes for the front and if the vote bank erodes because of an ally in the front, that is what I call a minus alliance,” he said. He said when the AIADMK lost in 1996, it had about 28% votes and it was about 33% in 2006 but the party bagged only about 18% votes in the 2019 Parliamentary election.

Asked if the AIADMK subscribed to the BJP’s plan to organise padayatras to the abodes of Lord Murugan, Mr. Raajhaa said: “The AIADMK government will protect the people’s right to practise religion but if there are law and order issues, the law will take its course.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/m0v0t6/article32824194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/allies-must-accept-cm-candidate-to-remain-in-front-aiadmk/article32824195.ece
192,2020/10/11,"Families return to settlement in STR, take up MGNREGS works","The residents had relocated 10 years ago in search of jobs

The Kembanur tribal settlement in the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) earlier had just three inhabitants. Now, 18 families, which have taken up farming and other works under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), reside here.

The settlement, located about 12 km from the Athani–Sathyamangalam Road, falls under the Kongarpalayam panchayat in the T.N. Palayam Panchayat Union in Gobichettipalayam Taluk. Some 10 years ago, over 50 families, all belonging to the Urali community, left for Kembanur Colony, located outside the forest area in Vinoba Nagar. They went in search of jobs and better education opportunities. But three residents stayed put, all through these years, cultivating millets in their small holdings.

Hit by lockdown

With the COVID-19 lockdown in place, most relocated families could not find jobs, even as the closure of schools were an added burden. Eighteen families — over 55 persons — returned to the settlement and constructed huts and took up farming.

“We were given conditional pattas for the land and we cultivated maize, groundnut, ragi, other millets and a variety of paddy that can grow without water,” said Maniyal, 37.

As many as 23 people were provided jobs to construct stone bunds in the fields, under the MGNREGS, and were assured of an income in the last two months. “It is our only income and we purchase essentials and other things with the money,” she said.

Though the daily wage was fixed at ₹256, workers were unaware of the amount they would be paid. “For 15 days’ work, we recently withdrew ₹1,000,” said Ammasai, 45. This is the first time that works under the scheme have been carried out in the settlement, providing income to the families, she said.

M. Srirangan, 71, the oldest person in the settlement, said since more families had returned to their native place, the government should establish a school, improve the roads and provide essentials through a mobile ration shop regularly. “Elephants, wild boar, buffaloes and bear stray onto our fields, damaging crops, and, hence, we need trenches to be dug,” he added.

There are over 40 children in the hamlet, and the presence of wild animals on the 6-km non-motorable route to Vilankombai or Vinoba Nagar will make it difficult for them to pursue studies. “We have been living here for over two centuries and a school will ensure that we produce graduates in the coming years,” said Mr. Srirangan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5jw1io/article32824191.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THAGRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/families-return-to-settlement-in-str-take-up-mgnregs-works/article32824192.ece
193,2020/10/11,"Housing policy: noble intentions, but improvements needed","The new policy expands housing possibilities, but falls short of addressing some fundamental issues

After staying long in the making, the first Tamil Nadu Affordable Urban Housing and Habitat Policy has been finally notified and it has been in the public realm for a few weeks now. Coming as it does, at a time when housing prices are steeply increasing, and owning or renting a house is possible only in far peripheries, the policy is a significant step. It has noble intentions and expands housing possibilities, including transit and rental housing for migrant workers. While this is a plus, in the absence of any reliable stock-taking, a clear statement of the problem and reassuring solutions, there are serious questions about the policy’s effectiveness.

Avowed objectives of the policy are three — first, the government will henceforth provide housing only for the very poor and ease its financial burden; second, it will nudge the private sector to provide affordable housing for the low and middle-income groups, particularly rental units; and third, using a shelter fund as a critical financial tool, it will support private developers to provide affordable housing and create a viable market for them. The policy rightly identifies that, besides building units, affordable housing, economically, requires the provision of social amenities, built sustainably and designed for climate resilience.

The ideas appear significant, but the problem is that they flounder on the fundamentals. A policy on affordable housing would usually first define affordability, estimate the demand and supply, work out the shortage, and spell out strategies to bridge them. However, the Tamil Nadu policy fails on this count. In the absence of a factual basis, a quantification of the problem and empirical measures to review the policy outcomes, good intentions could remain mere platitudes.

The fundamentals

Housing studies show that four factors affect affordability — the price of the house and income of the buyer; unit size; location; and availability of serviced land. The price-to-income ratio, in case of ownership, and rent-to-income in case of rental housing indicates how much an income group can pay for housing. When the ratio exceeds four in case of purchase or 30% of monthly income in case of renting, the house becomes unaffordable for lower-income groups. Over the last five years, in Chennai, as the previous year’s RBI study shows, this ratio has been increasing, making housing less and less affordable.

How does the new policy address this fundamental problem? It is silent. Not that the State is unaware of it. A draft housing policy study note in 2018 listed affordability housing prices for many districts. For example, in Chennai and Tiruvannamalai, where the median annual income of a household is ₹3.5 lakh and ₹2.25 lakh respectively, the affordable housing price is about ₹14 lakh and ₹9 lakh. Secondly, it ignores the vast differences between cities, and appears to view the entire State through the lens of Chennai.

A related issue is the scale of the housing problem. For instance, at ₹14 lakh as the affordability price in Chennai, about 56% of households or 7.55 lakh households are below the mark. Hence, it becomes imperative to estimate the housing demand and supply, against each income group, and work out strategies accordingly.

On the face of it, the three policy objectives appear meaningful. However, they seem to overlook ground realities. The State has decided to limit its direct provisions only to the economically-weaker sections (EWS), leaving out the lower-income groups (LIG). It will become evident, when the income figures are considered, that LIG also deserves equal attention. A study by MIDS in 2019, to which the author contributed, shows that the affordable housing price for LIG is about ₹16 lakh. Even if we assume personal savings could be mobilised, prices above ₹18 lakh-₹20 lakh, or rent beyond ₹10,000 would be unaffordable. For the rest of Tamil Nadu, the figures would be a lot lower.

The MIDS study also shows that in Chennai, private builders find ₹30 lakh-₹50 lakh as the lowest financially viable price segment to build, that too at a distance. Rentals within the city and close to job markets are steep. The policy seems to think that through financial incentives and higher FSI, it can convince private developers to supply houses at around ₹20 lakh, and that will lead to lower rents. This is going to be difficult, as the study mentioned above points out, as the FSI increase from 1.5 to 2 has had a marginal impact. Relatively low interest rates also will have a limited influence on price. A thriving, high-priced housing market requires more efforts.

Shelter fund

The policy holds the creation of a shelter fund as one of its flagship ideas. The government proposes tier I, a government-controlled fund, and tier II, an alternate investment fund, made up of contributions from the State and potential investors. Both are meant to enhance investment in affordable housing.

The tier-I fund is not entirely a new proposal. Since 2017, the government has provided an option for paying shelter charges for private projects exceeding 3,000 sq m, in place of reserving housing units for low-income groups. So far, it has collected about ₹181 crore. Not much has happened with this fund. When it comes to tier-II fund, meant to support private builders to take up mixed-income housing, there are no details about utilisation, selection of developers for funding and guarantees that the housing produced will be sold at affordable prices.

To make the policy useful and practical, first, data on housing demand and supply must be compiled, affordability has to be defined and shortage estimated. In the process, besides price, parameters such as location, unit size and job markets are to be factored in. Apart from supply-side incentives, demand-side support, particularly to LIG is necessary.

Land is central to addressing the affordable housing problem, and, hence, extensive investment in peri-urban areas to enhance the supply of serviced land is critical. To begin with, vast improvements can be made to transparency and public consultations, since as much as an acceptable policy, one also needs credible processes leading to it.

194,2020/10/11,‘Ensure equitable representation of Dalits in Catholic hierarchy’,"‘Only one of the 18 dioceses in Chennai has a Dalit as bishop’

With the office of bishops in five Catholic dioceses and one arch-diocese going vacant in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, Dalit Christian bodies have reiterated their demand for appointing Dalits to the posts to ensure their equitable representation in the Catholic hierarchy.

At a virtual meeting on Wednesday with the president of the Tamil Nadu Bishops’ Council and Archbishop of Madurai Antony Pappusamy, the bodies pointed out the lack of representation of Dalits in the hierarchy, particularly among bishops. M. Mary John, president, Dalit Christian Liberation Movement, said though Dalits constituted more than 50% of the Catholic population in T.N. and Puducherry, only one of the 18 dioceses of the Latin Catholic rite in Chennai had a Dalit as bishop.

Arguing that the first appointment of a Dalit as bishop happened only in 1993, to the Vellore diocese after considerable pressure from Dalit Christian movements, he said three more were appointed and one was elevated as Archbishop in the next 12 years.

“However, even this marginal progress towards equitable representation has been reversed in the last 15 years as there has not been even a single Dalit among at least eight bishops and archbishops appointed during the period,” he said.

He said the situation was similar across the country. “Though Dalits are a majority among the Catholic community throughout India, only 11 of the roughly 170 bishops are Dalits,” he said. The organisations demanded that Dalits be appointed to all five vacancies in the State and Puducherry.

At a media interaction, when asked whether the smaller parties in the DMK-led alliance would contest on the latter’s ‘Rising Sun’ symbol, Mr. Vaiko said, “There is no scope for such talks. The MDMK will contest with its individuality. MDMK will get its own symbol and contest on that symbol.” In the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, MDMK candidate C. Ganesamoorthy was elected on the DMK’s symbol from Erode.

Mr. Vaiko felt the DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu remained strong and continued to remain together in its goals and was determined that the ruling AIADMK should be removed from power. “There is no doubt that the DMK will get a majority in the upcoming Assembly elections and form the government.

197,2020/10/11,Stalin urges CM to release White Paper on investments and jobs,"‘Disclose details of procurements made to tackle COVID-19’

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday challenged Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to release a White Paper on the number of investments attracted and jobs created under the AIADMK government.

“If the Chief Minister really has the guts, let him release the White Paper on the number of investments and jobs created. I also request him to release another White Paper on the procurements made for tackling COVID-19,” he said in a statement.

Only when the White Papers is released would the corruption committed by the government come to light. He termed as “mere eyewash” the Chief Minister’s statement that the government had made Tamil Nadu one of the top investment destinations in India.

Rise in COVID-19 cases

The status of memoranda of understanding signed at the two Global Investors Meet was not known, he said, adding that the number of COVID-19 cases was increasing in the State.

The State’s debt had touched ₹4.56 lakh crore and reports said the government had so far borrowed ₹50,000 crore this year, he said.

In addition, the government had said it would go with option 1 on GST compensation, which meant it had agreed to borrow from the market and had surrendered the State’s rights to the GST Council, he said.

The State did not have data on the death of healthcare workers and doctors, and the district-wise breakdown of the number of tests was also not shared, he said.

Mr. Stalin alleged that the Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues were flouting physical distancing norms in the name of meetings, including the one to announce the AIADMK’s candidate for Chief Minister.

He said the Chief Minister did not have the guts to make public the report submitted by a high-level committee, headed by former Reserve Bank of India Governor C. Rangarajan, to revive the State’s economy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/i0k58f/article32824088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stalin-urges-cm-to-release-white-paper-on-investments-and-jobs/article32824089.ece

200,2020/10/11,"337 new COVID-19 cases, one death recorded in Union Territory","Cabinet meeting on Monday will discuss the pandemic situation in detail

The Union Territory recorded 337 new COVID-19 cases and one death on Saturday.

In a virtual media briefing, Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao said a 62-year-old resident of Vanarapet succumbed to the infection while undergoing treatment at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Research Institute.

The death of one more person has taken the toll to 559.

With the latest admissions, active cases have increased to 4,719. Of the total active cases, 2,983 persons are under home isolation and the remaining 1,736 at various healthcare centres.

As on Saturday, a total of 31,233 persons got infected with the novel coronavirus and 25,955 persons have recovered, he said.

In the last 24 hours, 4,829 persons had been tested for the virus, he added.

Mr. Rao told The Hindu that 17 per cent of the population had been tested for COVID-19.

So far, 2,30,024 people had been tested, he said adding that the Cabinet meeting scheduled to be held on Monday would discuss the COVID-19 situation in detail.

“We have deployed all our manpower and financial resources for COVID-19 works. While continuing to maintain the momentum in containing the spread of COVID-19 and treatment, the government also wanted to focus on non-COVID patients who needed treatment at government health centres,” he said.

The number of non-COVID patients coming to Government General Hospital and Medical College had come down drastically due to redeployment of healthcare workers, he said.

“The Health Department is of the view that even regular patients at government hospitals are dependent on private clinics. This will be a drain on their resources,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7vfvcq/article32824035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THTESTPY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/337-new-covid-19-cases-one-death-recorded-in-union-territory/article32824036.ece
201,2020/10/11,‘DBT is the legitimate mode for implementing welfare schemes’,"The mode has democratised the delivery of welfare benefits, says L-G

Stating that her decision to press for the direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode for implementing welfare schemes in the Union Territory was upheld by the judiciary and the Union Government, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi on Saturday said DBT has democratised the receiving of welfare benefits as it empowers the people to use the fund as per their needs.

Responding to Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy’s criticism for overlooking the elected government’s decision to distribute rice and materials instead of transferring money, Ms. Bedi in a message to reporters said since the policy decision on DBT was taken, crores of rupees had been transferred and deposited in the accounts of beneficiaries.

“Not a single complaint has come concerning this measure from any of the beneficiaries. The Lt. Governor’s office has supported all legitimate needs whenever forwarded by the Secretariat after examination by the Chief Secretary and the Finance Department,” she said.

The Chief Minister, instead of expressing satisfaction and happiness over the benefits of DBT mode to the people, was “lamenting for reasons best known to him,” the Lt. Governor said.

‘No corruption’

The Chief Minister should be most relieved that lakhs of people were receiving everything without any financial loss, she said. “The DBT is the approved and legitimate mode now. It has no leakages. No corruption. No loss of revenue in transmission at all. The benefits are going straight into the bank accounts of the poor,” she said.

Ms. Bedi urged the Chief Minister to stop misinforming the people about the Union Government and the Lt. Governor.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aa3uqi/article32824015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THL-G,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dbt-is-the-legitimate-mode-for-implementing-welfare-schemes/article32824016.ece
202,2020/10/11,Government targets procurement of 1.65 crore tonnes of paddy,"The State government has targeted procurement of 1.65 crore tonnes of paddy from farmers at the back of a record production in the current year.

Of this massive quantity, procurement in the Vaanakalam (kharif) is expected to be around 90 lakh metric tonnes and balance 75 lakh metric tonnes during Yasangi (rabi season). The government has already announced a minimum support price of ₹1,888 a quintal for A-grade variety and ₹1,868 a quintal for the B-grade or common variety.

The significant improvement in the procurement target is attributed to the projected rise in the area under agriculture with the operationalisation of major projects like Kaleshwaram. Procurement of 1.65 crore tonnes of paddy would set a record for the State as the procurement was 1.12 crore MT in 2019-20 and 77.41 lakh MT in the year before that. Paddy procurement for the entire crop year hovered around 50 to 60 lakh MT during the previous years.

The Civil Supplies department has released the paddy procurement policy for the current year after the State Cabinet, which met under the chairmanship of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, finalized the action plan for the purpose at the village level itself. As the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the government has decided to open 5,690 procurement centres in villages so that overcrowding at agricultural market committees is avoided and the process is taken up at the farmers’ doorstep.

Paddy procured from farmers should be custom milled and the resultant raw rice delivered by millers would be utilised for Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) and other welfare measures. The annual requirement of raw rice for TPDS and other welfare schemes, including open market sales scheme with two months buffer, is pegged at approximately 28.8 lakh metric tonnes.

The policy mentioned in detail the specifications of paddy, including the presence of foreign matter, both organic and inorganic, discolouration, moisture content and immature, shrunken or shrivelled grains. The Civil Supplies Corporation, IKP (women self-help groups), agriculture cooperative societies and other agencies would make paddy purchases at procurement centres. The allotment of procurement centres to these groups would, however, be made after taking into consideration their previous performance.

The policy contained clear guidelines pertaining to custom milling of paddy to be undertaken by rice millers and they were directed to deliver the custom milled rice within 15 days of receipt of paddy. “The collectors shall take action to blacklist the rice millers who divert paddy stocks delivered for custom milling or indulge in purchase of PDS rice”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/fv674i/article32831385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Telangana1RegGSE4EQGO64jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/govt-targets-procurement-of-165-crore-tonnes-of-paddy/article32828875.ece
203,2020/10/11,Heavy rain forecast in next two days in Telangana,"Portion of an old house damaged by rain collapses in old city killing two

The State government has sounded high alert to the public and official machinery in the wake of forecast of heavy to very heavy rain in the next two days due to deep depression in Bay of Bengal.

Mr. Somesh Kumar, in turn alerted the officers, quoting met department’s warning about massive flooding and waterlogging in low-lying areas. Falling of trees and electric poles can happen leading to disruption of normal activity. Reservoirs, tanks and streams could overflow causing inundation of low-lying areas. Low-level causeways could dip in water flow, posing threat to traffic and public. Traffic and pedestrian movement on the causeways should be prohibited.

Earlier, the met department issued a release that “heavy to very heavy rain was very likely to occur at isolated places” in the erstwhile districts of Adilabad, Karimnagar, Nizamabad, Warangal, Khammam and Nalgonda. Thunderstorm accompanied by lightning was very likely at isolated places over Telangana.

Meanwhile, rain led to the collapse of a portion of an old house at Hussaini Alam in the old city which resulted in the killing of two young women, including a teenager. Hussaini Alam inspector Ramesh Kotwal said that the incident took place at around 12 noon when the victims were in the house. “Soon, they were rescued and rushed to nearby hospitals, where the two women Farah Begum (24) and Anees Begum (18) died while undergoing treatment,” he said.

The injured are Haji Mohammed Khan (54), Parveen Begum (42), Azmath Khan (28), Master Hussain Khan (one-year-and-six-months) and Hussain Khan (four months).

Mr. Rao succumbed to the stab wounds on the way to hospital a short while later. He is survived by wife and three children.

An elderly man was buried alive in Meghalaya on October 7 for allegedly practising witchcraft, more than a week after two people were lynched and cremated in adjoining Assam for the same reason.

208,2020/10/11,Congress to probe ‘assault’ charge by U.P. woman worker,"Party gave ticket to a rapist, she says; two leaders expelled

The Congress on Sunday launched an internal inquiry after a woman party member was allegedly manhandled during an event in Deoria district in Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) after she opposed the nomination of a leader as the party candidate in the upcoming Assembly byelection.

Tara Yadav alleged that the person nominated by the Congress, Mukund Bhaskar Mani Tripathi, was a rape accused. However, Congress sources said there were no formal charges against him and Ms. Yadav was unhappy over being denied ticket.

The ruckus at the local Congress office was caught on camera. In the video, which was circulated widely on social media platforms, Ms. Yadav was seen confronting Congress secretary Sachin Naik during an event on Saturday.

She then allegedly throws a bouquet at him, following which, others present in the hall push and shove Ms. Yadav, while some charge at her. A couple of them also hit her amid the chaos. Ms. Yadav tries to retaliate before others step in to escort her out of the hall.

‘Hurts party’s image’

Ms. Yadav later told presspersons that she was confronting Mr. Naik over the choice of the candidate for the Deoria seat when she was attacked.

“You have given ticket to a rapist. This hurts the Congress’s image in public. You could give it to someone else whose character is clean. As soon as I had said this, somebody there pushed me from behind and started assaulting me,” Ms. Yadav told presspersons. She also said that she received bruises and cuts on her lip, ear and back.

Talking to a news channel, Ms. Yadav said that while the top leadership of the Congress, including general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, were “seeking justice for the daughter of Hathras”, the local leadership in Deoria had handed ticket to a “rapist”.

Congress leaders Deen Dayal Yadav and Ajay Kumar Sainthwar were expelled from the party for “indiscipline” during the meeting, said Kaushal Kumar Tripathi, secretary, U.P. Congress.

210,2020/10/11,Kashmir tourism takes baby steps to normalcy as visitors return,"While domestic footfalls have picked up, the UT has also won the bid to host the Skal tourism congress next year

The tide is finally turning for Kashmir’s beleaguered tourism industry, a key contributor to the Union Territory's economy, which has witnessed a 13-month hiatus due to the double whammy of the revocation of special status last year followed by the COVID-19 pandemic this year.

International competition

The silver lining has come with the UT winning the bid to host the 50th annual Skal International Asia Area (SIAA) Congress in 2021 during the annual general meeting recently against four other cities. Skål International is a an organisation of tourism leaders around the world, promoting global tourism and friendship. The Congress is likely to be held between April 8 and 11 next year at Srinagar’s Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC).

“Kashmir has witnessed the darkest phase in the tourism sector ever. The August 5 decision last year kept tourists away due to the official bar for many, many months. The COVID-19 pandemic only prolonged the grim period, witnessing highest ever job losses of around 75,000 in the sector. The SIAA Congress has come as a good omen,” Nasir Shah, secretary of Skal Club of Srinagar, told The Hindu.

Winning the bid was not easy though

.

“The Skal is a Spain-based tourism body with 15,000 members and 150 chapters across the world. Kashmir won the spot against four top cities of Europe and Asia. This event will pave way for international tourism players to visit Kashmir and flip the international tourist footfall,” Mr. Shah said.

Mr. Shah, whose group has already started preparations for the event, said the J&K administration needs to further streamline COVID 19-related measures to ensure hassle free movement.

Group tours return

With the pandemic situation improving, domestic tourists have also started planning their visits to Kashmir. In the last week of September, the Kashmir Valley hosted the biggest group of 70 doctors from Delhi in 13 months at the Royal Hilton hotel.

“We can't stop the cycle of life. A group of doctors decided to come to Kashmir to bring positivity in our team, after spending months inside their homes from March. We chose Pahalgam for being the country’s best hill station,” said Dr. Archana, a doctor who was part of the group, said.

According to official figures, the Kashmir Valley has a total of 40,753 hotel rooms in around 1,500 hotels. “The occupancy has been around 1% in the last one year,” an official said.

Welcome at Gulmarg

Buoyed by the growing tourist footfalls, the J&K Cable Car Corporation on Saturday restarted Asia’s highest cable car, Gondola, in north Kashmir’s ski attraction Gulmarg.

“The second phase of the Gulmarg Gondola from Kongdoori to Apharwat opened for commercial operation October 10. It will be operational only on weekends for the time being. But the operation of Gondola for the first phase, from Gulmarg to Kongdoori, will continue to remain functional on a daily basis,” an official spokesman of the Cable Car Corporation said.

The Corporation has put in place COVID-19 protocols and standard operating procedures after boarding and deboarding of passengers.

From an income of ₹6.69 crore from tourism in 2018, revenue plummeted to just around ₹45 lakh in the past two years, an official said.

211,2020/10/11,Trouble knocking on Tripura Chief Minister’s door?,"A Tripura BJP MLA told The Hindu that he and six other MLAs are in Delhi to share some issues with regard to Biplab Deb with national president J.P. Nadda, who is in Bihar.

Seven Tripura BJP MLAs in New Delhi have been awaiting an audience with the national leadership since Saturday, with mid-term trouble knocking on Chief Minister Biplab Deb’s door.

One BJP MLA from the State told The Hindu that he and six other MLAs are in Delhi to share some issues with regard to Mr. Deb with national president J.P. Nadda, who is in Bihar.

“We have no issues with the party but feel that Chief Minister Biplab Deb is not delivering on the promises made to the people of Tripura who had elected the BJP with great hopes. We are halfway through the term of this government and nowhere close to the promises made. I and several others left the Congress party to join the BJP as it was the only way to overthrow the CPI(M) government. We feel that the disappointment with the government needs to be addressed,” said the MLA. The team is being led by MLA Sudip Roy Barman and includes Ashish Saha, Ashish Das, Diwan Chandra Rankhal, Burb Mohan Tripura and Parimal Deb Burman.

Incidentally, most of these MLAs had moved to the BJP just before the polls. Sources close to Mr. Deb said Mr. Choudhary and others were resentful at their place within the government rather than any genuine grievance against the government. But dissident MLAs, also considered close to BJP national secretary Sunil Deodhar, assert that they are not without support.

Sources in the BJP say the lack of a general secretary in charge of Tripura, after the exit of Ram Madhav from the national team, is telling on the handling of the State. While sources said general secretary in-charge of the organisation B.L. Santosh had met the group, he did not give them any assurance of a change in leadership.

State BJP president Manik Saha told The Hindu that the team was not acting according to the discipline required to be a member of a political party. “These issues needn’t be aired in public and need to be told within the party forum. I, as president, have not been informed about their trip to Delhi. I’m observing these events and will act soon,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/f2nch1/article32827748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI372018000027B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mid-term-trouble-knocking-on-tripura-chief-ministers-door/article32827749.ece
212,2020/10/11,Coronavirus | Odisha to review COVID-19 deaths at district level,"Amid doubts over the actual number, govt. says quality of care remains its priority

After doubts were cast over the actual number of COVID-19 deaths, the Odisha government has constituted district level committees to review the issue.

Odisha has so far reported 1,022 deaths accounting for 0.95% of the national toll. Its case load is 2,52,239. The government claims that the fatality rate at 0.405% is one of the lowest in the country.

For the last few weeks, relatives of the deceased have been openly expressing dissatisfaction in social media over under-reporting of deaths. They alleged that the government had not mentioned the deaths of the relatives of the deceased in the daily bulletins.

Some had even video-recorded cremation of people at designated pandemic crematorium in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack to show that the number was clearly more than that put out daily by the Health and Family Welfare (HFW) department in the bulletin.

The HFW issued a notification on Saturday saying the government had constituted district-level committees to audit the quality of care and death review to be headed by an officer authorised by either the Collector or the Municipal Commissioner.

The government said prevention of deaths by providing timely and quality care remained the utmost priority while it was found necessary to have an oversight over both.

“These committees will audit the quality of care at the facilities and review deaths of positive or suspect patients in government and private hospitals in the district or the corporation area,” says the notification.

The committee will examine the full medical records of the patients to strengthen the system and improve response to save lives.

While the district-level information pointed out the toll had already crossed 20 in Nuapada, the State dashboard showed the western Odisha district had only one death. Similarly, there were over 25 deaths in Kalahandi, but the State level information continued to stick to 15.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gdpl73/article32827731.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUSAWARENESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-odisha-to-review-covid-19-deaths-at-district-level/article32827732.ece
213,2020/10/11,BJP-JJP govt. will fall sooner than expected: Bhupinder Singh Hooda,"Congress has a responsibility to raise its voice against anti-people policy of government, says the former Haryana CM

Ahead of the by-poll for the Baroda Assembly seat in Haryana, Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said given the farmers’ anger after the enactment of new agriculture sector laws and the Centre’s indifference to the farmers’ issue, the ruling BJP-Jannayak Janta Party coalition government will fall sooner than expected.

Do you think the Centre’s new agriculture sector laws will be a key issue in the by-poll? How do you plan to continue your fight against laws?

Yes, it's definitely going to be a major election issue among other issues. The Congress party, being the opposition party, has a responsibility to raise its voice against any injustice or anti-people policy of the government. We strongly feel that the new agriculture laws are tilted in favour of corporates at the cost of farmers.

First, these laws do not even mention the Minimum Support Price, leave alone talk of guaranteeing it. There is no denying the fact that MSP, though not remunerative price of the farmers’ produce, has provided the farmers security and stability of income over the last six decades.

The BJP government is trying to project these laws as ‘historic’ and ‘reforms’, but the timing, the undemocratic method and manner and the unwarranted haste with which these laws have been passed give rise to valid apprehensions in the minds of the farmers about the abolition of ‘mandis’ and the MSP in due course. We will continue the fight for the rights of the farmers with more vigour in the coming days and there are historic reasons for that.

In 2007, the Congress government in Haryana framed laws on contract farming which clearly stipulated that no agreement with the farmers would be done below the MSP. In 2010, the committee constituted by the Government of India for increasing productivity under my chairmanship recommended that the MSP be increased to C2 formula of Swaminathan Commission’s report and it should not be dispensed with for the protection of the farmers. Moreover, the constitutionality of these new laws have been challenged in the Supreme Court as these are in contravention of federal structure of our Constitution.

Why has the Congress has been demanding that the JJP pull out from BJP-led coalition government? Do you think the alliance will complete its 5-year term?

It is a matter of principled politics. It is a fact that the JJP fought and was elected against the misrule and anti-farmer policies of the BJP government in Haryana. Now, it is in a Catch-22 situation. They are blowing hot and cold. They are criticising the recent lathi-charge on farmers at ‘Kurukshetra rally’ on the one hand while their second hand is tightly catching the chair.

It is time for the JJP to choose between the interest of farmers and their own interests. It is a Hobson’s choice for them but in order to atone for the sin of betrayal of the farmers, they should resign forthwith. They cannot fool the people any longer.

Also read: ‘BJP-JJP govt. has been rocked by scandals’

This government will fall sooner than expected because of the inherent contradictions and lack of cohesion. The increasing crime, the rampant corruption, the swelling debt, the increasing unemployment makes this government a monumental failure. The sooner it goes, it is better for the State.

What does the Baroda Assembly by-poll mean for Congress and State politics?

Any election is a referendum on the functioning of the incumbent government. The Baroda by-election is crucial and it will determine the direction of politics in Haryana in the coming years. The Congress party is set to win this election and the people are eager to punish BJP-JJP government for crime, corruption, communalism, debt, unemployment, new farmer laws, contradictions, scams and scandals, drug menace, inefficiency, inflation, fear and falsehood. The BJP-JJP combine is afraid of entering into the poll fray and has conceded the Congress victory.

The Congress has suffered politically in Haryana on account of not having either block or district committees... When is an organisational overhaul expected?

It is, of course, a fact that the Congress party has not made organisational appointments at the district and block level for the last few years. Hopefully, the organisation will be reorganised and revitalised at the earliest. We are in the process of reconstituting the block-level Congress committees and district Congress committees and other bodies of Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee soon.

How do you assess the performance of ruling BJP-JJP alliance government?

As I said earlier, the performance of BJP-JJP alliance government is dismal and disappointing. They have failed to give any hope to the people of the State. The people of the State are disillusioned and disgruntled with this government as there is no semblance of governance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8c91c8/article32827621.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHUPINDERSINGHHOODACHANDIGARH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-jjp-govt-will-fall-sooner-than-expected-bhupinder-singh-hooda/article32827622.ece
214,2020/10/11,Recent chain of events in Bengal call for imposition of President’s Rule: Babul Supriyo,"Countering the Union Minister’s narrative, Trinamool MP Sougata Roy said Supriyo was a “novice” and had no idea of the circumstances under which the President’s rule is imposed

Union Minister Babul Supriyo on Sunday said the recent chain of events in West Bengal -- from the arrest of al-Qaeda linkmen to the controversy involving a Sikh man and his turban show that it was a “fit case” for imposition of President’s Rule on the State.

The Asansol MP also said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is “oppressing” opposition parties in Bengal, must have forgotten her struggles at the grassroots level.

Mr. Supriyo, while talking to reporters, claimed that the police had, in a “planned manner”, isolated a member of the Sikh community, assaulted him and pulled his turban, during the BJP’s protest rally on Thursday.

“The recent chain of events -- ranging from the attack on a Sikh community member, the arrest of al-Qaeda operatives to brazen murder of Manish Shukla and other political opponents -- show that it is a fit case for imposition of Article 365 in West Bengal,” he said.

Controversy erupted after visuals of the police beating up a Sikh man during BJP’s protest on Thursday went viral on social media, with a section of Netizens claiming that the police had pulled his turban during the scuffle. The police, however, said that the person was carrying a firearm and his headgear “had fallen off automatically in the scuffle”

Countering the Union minister’s narrative, veteran Trinamool MP Sougata Roy said Supriyo was a “novice” and had no idea of the circumstances under which the President’s rule is imposed.

“Babul is a newcomer in politics, having joined BJP only a few years back. He has no idea about what he says. He doesn’t know that before imposing Article 365, an advisory under Article 355 has to be issued by the Centre,” Mr. Roy said.

Asserting the situation in West Bengal doesn’t warrant any such step, he said Shukla’s murder was a fallout of the saffron camp’s internal feud.

Mr. Roy further said that the minister of state for environment, forest and climate change was making “absurd claims to hog attention”, as he was not getting any prominence in his party.

“Supriyo is referring to some stray incidents, such as the murder of a muscle man like Shukla due to BJP’s internal feud and police action to quell violent protest by the party.

“As far as arrests of al-Qaeda linkmen were concerned, such things can happen anywhere. In that case, what does he have to say about the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh?” he added.

BJP leader Manish Shukla was shot dead by gun-toting assailants in Titagarh earlier this month, with the saffron party accusing the ruling TMC of orchestrating the murder.

In September, six al-Qaeda linkmen were arrested by the NIA in Murshidabad district.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/9uwa27/article30475205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nd03-spatGQP6UGS36UF6G73jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/recent-chain-of-events-in-bengal-call-for-imposition-of-presidents-rule-babul-supriyo/article32827388.ece

A BJP delegation led by its national vice-president Mukul Roy met West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday and demanded a CBI investigation into the “politically targeted killing” of saffron party leader Manish Shukla in North 24 Parganas district a week ago.

The delegation alleged the state CID, which is investigating the case, is misdirecting the probe to falsely implicate political opponents in the BJP, Dhankhar said in a Twitter post.

Mr. Shukla, who was a close aide of Barrackpore’s BJP MP Arjun Singh, was shot dead in front of the party’s office in Titagarh on October 4.

The State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has so far arrested three persons in connection with the killing.

The delegation, also comprising BJP leaders Jaiprakash Majumdar and Sabyasachi Dutta, handed over a letter to the governor at Raj Bhavan demanding a CBI probe into the case.

“BJP delegation led by National Vice President Mukul Roy demanded CBI investigation in the politically targeted killing of Manish Shukla. The delegation alleged CID was misdirecting investigation to falsely implicate political opponents in BJP,” Mr. Dhankhar tweeted.

BJP lawmaker Arjun Singh had on Saturday alleged that the CID was “plotting” to frame him in the murder case.

Mr. Dhankhar, who has had frequent face-offs with the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal, has often raised questions on law and order in the state and claimed that political opponents were not being given space for democratic movements.

A PIL has also been filed before the Calcutta High Court seeking a CBI investigation into the killing, claiming that a free and fair probe is only possible if a central and independent agency is in charge of it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8s3b7w/article32374045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAGDEEPDHANKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-leaders-meet-bengal-guv-demand-cbi-probe-into-manish-shukla-murder-case/article32827151.ece

“The campaign will be through virtual mode on October 12 and 13. From October 14, he is likely to fly to different parts to address election meetings while remaining physically present,” Mr. Jha said.

He said the virtual campaign will commence on Monday evening, connecting the CM to 11 assembly segments of six districts. This will be followed by addresses to 11 assembly segments of five districts on Tuesday morning and another 13 constituencies of four districts in the evening.

Replying to a query, Mr. Jha, also a state minister, said, “The BJP is finalising the election campaign programme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We do not have details but it is certain that he and the chief minister will be sharing the stage on a number of occasions.”

218,2020/10/11,Gujarat bypolls | BJP fields five ex-Congress MLAs,"Helped by the resignation of these five MLAs, the BJP had managed to win three out of four Rajya Sabha seats for which elections were held in June

Five Congress legislators who had defected to the BJP earlier this year during the Rajya Sabha polls figured among the seven candidates the BJP has named for eight by-elections scheduled for next month.

The BJP is yet to announce its candidate for the Limbadi seat. A total of eight Congress legislators had resigned from the party as well as their membership from the Legislative Assembly to join the BJP. Their resignations from the House necessitated the by-elections in their respective constituencies.

The five defected leaders who have now been fielded by the ruling party are: J.V. Kakadia from Dhari, Brijesh Merja from Morbi, Jitu Chaudhary from the tribal-reserved seat Kaprada, Akshay Patel from Karajan and Pradhyumansinh Jadeja from Abdasa.

From another tribal reserved seat, Dangs, the BJP has fielded its ex-legislator Vijay Patel instead of Congress defector Mangal Gavit, while from SC-reserved Gadhada, former Minister Atmaram Parmar has been fielded instead of former Congress leader Pravin Maru.

In Limbadi, the party is likely to field former Minister Kiritsinh Rana, but Congress defector Somabhai Patel has announced that he would contest the polls irrespective of whether the BJP fields him or not.

The eight legislators had switched over from the Congress in the run up to the Rajya Sabha polls. The BJP’s third candidate had won despite small numbers as the effective strength of the House came down after the resignations of the eight members.

On the Opposition front, State Congress leaders, along with All India Congress Committee in-charge of the State, Rajeev Satav, held a review meeting to screen potential candidates for the eight seats. Party leaders have reportedly prepared a panel of 3 to 4 potential candidates for each seat, and names will be finalised after deliberations with local leaders and cadres.

Both parties have already appointed seat-wise observers and in-charge leaders.

Meanwhile, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there would not be any large scale campaigning through rallies and large meetings. Both parties are going for digital campaigning using social media platforms and holding group meetings of 100-200 people.

The Election Commission and the State government have issued detailed SOPs for campaigning, under which not more than 200 people can gather in a rally or a meeting, while on stage, only seven persons can be seated.

There are 172 members in the 182-member House, of which 103 are from the BJP, 65 from Congress, two from the Bharatiya Tribal Party, one from the NCP and one Independent member. The elections for two other vacant seats of Dwarka and Morva Hadaf have not been announced as matters related to them are sub-judice and pending before the Supreme Court.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rouphh/article31074264.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GUJARATASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-fields-five-ex-cong-mlas-in-gujarat-bypolls/article32827100.ece

Punjab’s farmers’ organisations, who have been protesting against the new farm laws, on Sunday said the Centre has once again invited them for talks on the issue on October 14.

A decision on whether to accept the invitation will be taken at a meeting in Jalandhar on October 13, they said.

The farmers’ organisations, whose agitation against the farm laws has disrupted rail traffic and severely impacted coal supply for thermal power plants in Punjab, had last week rejected the Union Agriculture Department’s invitation to participate in a “conference to address their concerns” on October 8.

“We have received an invitation for a meeting on October 14,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).

“Though the invite has come from the agriculture secretary, it mentions that the central government wants to talk to farmers,” he said.

“All farmers’ organisations will decide whether to go to Delhi for talks in a meeting slated for October 13 in Jalandhar,” he added.

Farmers in Punjab have been demanding that these three laws be repealed.

They have been holding a ‘rail roko’ agitation against the “anti-farmer” laws, with protesters squatting on railway tracks at various places in the State since September 24.

Farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws will destroy the minimum support price mechanism, end Agricultural Produce Market Committees and allow corporates to arm-twist them.

The government, however, has been saying that these laws, which were passed by Parliament recently amid a vociferous Opposition protest, will raise farmers’ income, free them from the clutches of the middleman and usher in new technology in farming.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bnfnlq/article32798840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NorthIndia1NoGK37R8Q8M3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/invited-again-for-talks-on-farm-laws-by-centre-says-punjab-farmer-bodies/article32826629.ece

As the coronavirus cases continue to rise in Maharashtra, School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad has said schools will not reopen in the State before Diwali.

Maharashtra has till now reported 15,17,434 COVID-19 cases and 40,040 deaths due to the disease.

The Centre, on March 16, announced closure of all educational institutions, including schools, colleges and universities, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

It has now allowed graded reopening of schools from October 15.

Ms. Gaikwad, who recently recovered from COVID-19, said schools have been conducting virtual classes and teachers have been taking special classes for students in some areas.

However, the challenge is to find a way to end the academic year and assess students, she said.

“While we are exploring various options, it is clear that schools will not open before Diwali,” Ms. Gaikwad said.

According to senior officials in the State education department, reopening schools under the current circumstances is out of question, as there is no sign of the pandemic abating.

State Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant also said his department does not intend to reopen colleges until the COVID-19 situation is under control.

“The situation is grim for students who wish to pursue higher studies abroad, as their future depends on our decision,” he added.

Even as the State Government and bureaucracy mull over solutions, children and parents are worried as they seem to be caught in a quagmire.

“I have taken an education loan and my parents are repaying it. If I don’t get good grades in exams, how will I get a good job?” said Raviraj Humbe, an engineering student from Pune.

There must be some technical solution for conducting exams and tests, he said.

Meanwhile, education expert Kishore Darak suggested that the State Government can club two or three educational years so that concerns of parents about academic loss can be addressed.

While the safety of students is imperative, it is high time that the State comes up with a bipartisan approach towards education, he said.

“The government must come up with a solution where local officials are authorised to take context-specific decisions like full or partial reopening of schools or alternate day scheduling of classes, among others,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/82xwx/article31570054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMVARSHAGAIKWAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-schools-not-to-reopen-in-maharashtra-before-diwali/article32826219.ece

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered an FIR and taken over the investigation into the alleged gang rape and assault on a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras on September 14, leading to her death.

The agency has constituted a team to pursue various leads. Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code has also been invoked.

The case was initially registered at the Chandpa police station in Hathras. The complainant, brother of the victim, had alleged that on September 14, accused Sandeep tried to strangulate his sister in the millet field.

The woman succumbed to her injuries at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi on September 29. She was earlier admitted to a hospital in Aligarh

225,2020/10/11,"Hathras victim ‘no one’ to Uttar Pradesh CM, police: Rahul Gandhi","The shameful truth is many Indians don’t consider Dalits, Muslims and tribals to be human, tweets former Congress president

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the State police were denying that the 19-year-old victim in the Hathras gang rape and murder case had been raped as “she was no one” to them.

Mr. Gandhi was responding to a news report about the Uttar Pradesh police denying that the victim had been raped. He tweeted: “The shameful truth is many Indians don’t consider Dalits, Muslims and Tribals to be human. The CM & his police say no one was raped because for them, and many other Indians, she was NO ONE. (sic).”

The young Dalit woman was allegedly sexually assaulted by four men in her village last month. She succumbed to her injuries two weeks later at a hospital in Delhi.

Following a national outrage over the manner in which the Uttar Pradesh police and the local administration had cremated her body without the consent of her family, top Congress leaders including Mr. Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited Hathras on October 3.

Terming the Yogi Adityanath government as insensitive and anti-Dalit, the Congress has been demanding a judicial inquiry into the incident.

“According to the family of the victim, the district Magistrate meted out the worst treatment to them. So, who is protecting him? He should be dismissed without any delay and his role should be investigated. When the family is demanding a judicial inquiry, why is the Special Investigation Team probing and that too after a CBI inquiry was announced,” asked Ms. Vadra on twitter last week after meeting the family.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jienta/article32808420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THRAHUL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hathras-victim-was-no-one-to-uttar-pradesh-cm-police-says-rahul-gandhi/article32826050.ece

227,2020/10/11,Embarking on an exciting journey,"Anagha will be among the youngest players in the WT20

At 16, Anagha Murali is among the youngest players picked for the upcoming Women's T20 Challenge. Anagha will represent the Velocity side, alongside big names like Mithali Raj, Shafali Verma and Englishwoman Danielle Wyatt.

Anagha’s rise through the ranks has been dramatically quick. She took up the sport at 11, under the guidance of K. Muralidhara at Herons CC.

Just two weeks into her formal training, Anagha got picked for the Karnataka Under-16 team. A year later, the left-arm spinner made it to the Karnataka U-19 team.

She soon transitioned to the U-23 level, the women’s Karnataka Premier League exhibition matches, the senior KSCA club league and the senior Karnataka probables list.

Anagha won the 'Best Bowler' award in the women's under-16 and under-19 categories in the KSCA awards function last year.

Her father Murali recalls the start of her cricket journey. “Muralidhara spotted her talent early. When he said that Anagha should try out for the Karnataka U-16 side, we were surprised. She had only started her formal cricket training two weeks earlier. But Muralidhara was confident, and he was proved right,” Murali says.

Anagha, a 1st PUC student at Transcend PUC, is understandably excited and nervous about competing with the stars in the Women's T20 Challenge. The teenager cites Ravindra Jadeja as her idol.

229,2020/10/11,Indian Premier League 2020 | Our batting has lacked power: Dhoni,"The playoff dream is getting further away, says coach Fleming

Captain M.S. Dhoni and coach Stephen Fleming minced no words about the lack of intent shown by Chennai Super Kings after it lost its fifth game (in seven matches) to Royal Challengers Bangalore on Saturday.

Chasing a moderate target of 170, CSK’s batting failed miserably once again, especially the middle-order which did not even make an earnest attempt to increase the scoring rate.

Play the big shots

Speaking after the match, Dhoni said, “I think we are better off playing the other way round, playing the bigger shots even if you get out. That is something we can do in the coming games.

“Our batting has lacked a bit of power from the sixth over onwards. In the coming games, we will try to be more expressive. You rather get out in the 16th or 17th over.”

Fleming too echoed similar views: “What I would like is more intensity through the middle overs. We have plenty of batting. While we are recovering well (when we lose early wickets), we are leaving ourselves too much to do at the end.

“We have to release the shackles and give the hitters towards the end a little bit more freedom.”

Absence of youth

When the team was assembled in 2018, it was mocked as ‘Dad’s army’ considering most players were on the wrong side of their 30s. While CSK finished runner-up last year, the lack of youth is starting to hurt this time.

“The playoff dream is getting further away if we keep playing like this,” the former New Zealand skipper cautioned.

“We have an ageing team and the legs are getting a bit more tired.

“The conditions are a factor too. When we put this team together at the last auction, it was done to win five or six games at Chepauk.

“Spinners at this stage are playing a small role. The situation is a bit foreign for us and the results are showing that,” said Fleming.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cvu62o/article32828801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12BRAVO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/our-batting-has-lacked-power-dhoni/article32828802.ece
230,2020/10/11,Indian Premier League 2020 | Suryakumar and de Kock deliver for Mumbai Indians,"Capitals falter as Dhawan’s maiden fifty of the season goes in vain

Suryakumar Yadav played a second match-winning knock of the week to help Mumbai Indians cruise to a comfortable victory against Delhi Capitals and emerge as clear leader in the Indian Premier League points table.

Suryakumar’s 53 (32b, 6x4, 1x6) ensured that Quinton de Kock’s quickfire fifty (53, 36b, 4x4, 3x6) didn’t go waste as Mumbai Indians hunted down the target of 163 with five wickets and two balls to spare at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.

Easing the pressure

When de Kock mistimed a sweep to Prithvi Shaw at deep square in the 10th over, the winning mark was still 86 runs away. But, on a slowish pitch, Suryakumar and Ishan Kishan kept hitting the boundaries to ease the pressure.

Suryakumar used the crease effectively to sent Kagiso Rabada through third-man for a four followed by a whip over long-leg for a six that fetched him his fifty.

However, he perished in the last ball of the 15th over and the Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer pouched a skier. By then, however, the target was well in sight with 33 runs required off five overs. Despite a bit of a stutter, Kieron Pollard and Krunal Pandya saw their team through in the last over.

Capitals handed debut caps to Ajinkya Rahane and Alex Carey. Shikhar Dhawan (69 n.o., 52b, 6x4, 1x6) took the onus of batting through the innings after Prithvi Shaw and Rahane succumbed in the PowerPlay.

But Shreyas holing out in the deep in the 15th over after a partnership of 84 runs with Dhawan gave MI a chance to put the brakes. And a needless run out of Marcus Stoinis in the 17th over meant MI tightened the screws, conceding only 35 runs in the last four overs.

231,2020/10/11,Indian Premier League 2020 | Tewatia and Parag pull off a thriller,"Royals defeat Sunrisers with a ball to spare to end a four-match losing streak.

Rahul Tewatia and Riyan Parag stole a sensational win from right under the nose of Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday. The five-wicket victory, with a ball to spare, at the Dubai International Stadium finally brought an end to the terrible run for Rajasthan Royals, which had come into the match after losing its last four.

Ploy fails

On a surface where stroke-making didn’t seem easy, the target of 159 set by Sunrisers, after opting to bat, looked distant for Royals when its top-order crumbled again. The ploy to promote Ben Stokes — playing his first IPL game of the season — didn’t work as he chopped Khaleel Ahmed on to the stumps.

Skipper Steve Smith’s hesitation while going for a second run for Jos Buttler ended in his run-out. A couple of balls later, Buttler followed Smith to the dug-out, edging Khaleel behind.

In dire straits

Then Rashid Khan sent back Sanju Samson (26) and Robin Uthappa. At 78 for five, Royals was in dire straits. Another 81 was needed off eight overs when Tewatia (45 not out, 28b, 4x4, 2x6) joined Parag (42 not out, 26b, 2x4, 2x6). They were not separated till the winning shot came — a six by the teenager over cover off Khaleel.

It was splendid batting from Tewatia — whose stunning knock against KXIP had given Royals their first win a fortnight ago — and Parag, who has such a mature head on his young shoulders.

Earlier, Sunrisers was restricted by another excellent spell from Jofra Archer. But it was young seamer Kartik Tyagi who broke the opening partnership between Warner and Jonny Bairstow.

The Englishman’s attempt to hit a second straight six failed as Samson came up with a brilliant diving catch, timing his run towards his left from deep square-leg to perfection.

Warner then added 73 for the second wicket with Manish Pandey (54, 44b, 2x4, 3x6) before Archer cleaned up the opener with a fast, fuller, straighter delivery.

Kane Williams and Priyam Garg scored 35 off the last two overs to lend respectability to the SRH total. However, Parag and Tewatia had other ideas.

Scoreboard

Sunrisers Hyderabad Innings: David Warner b Archer 48; Jonny Bairstow c Samson b Kartik Tyagi 16; Manish Pandey c Tewatia b Unadkat 54; Kane Williamson not out 22; Priyam Garg run out (Archer/Buttler) 15. Extras: (NB-1, W-2) 3

232,2020/10/11,Indian Premier League 2020 | Kolkata takes on resurgent Bangalore,"Kolkata Knight Riders are third in the points table while Royal Challengers Bangalore are fourth.

Their campaign might be back on track with back-to-back victories but Kolkata Knight Riders will have little margin for error when they take on Virat Kohli’s resurgent Royal Challengers Bangalore in an Indian Premier League game here on Monday.

The two sides have won four of their six games with KKR ahead of RCB on net run rate but inconsistency in batting has been an issue for both the teams.

KKR are placed third in the standings and the two-time champions will be going all out for a victory at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium after registering two back-to-back wins against Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab.

RCB, on the other hand, are coming into the game following a 37-run morale boosting victory against CSK and will fancy their chances.

For KKR, the biggest cause of concern will be the availability of big-hitter Andre Russell, who hurt his knee when he dived into the advertisement boards after missing a catch on Saturday.

Skipper Dinesh Karthik did not reveal the extent of the injury after the match against KXIP.

“Whenever Russell gets injured, you know it is hard. He is a very special player, he is a very special person. We need to go and look at him,” he said.

KKR have battled batting inconsistencies this year. Shubman Gill has been fabulous at the top with two half centuries so far.

Rahul Tripathi, who replaced Sunil Narine as opener, scored 81 against CSK but failed against KXIP. Nitish Rana has looked good in patches while Eoin Morgan has also been erratic.

Skipper Karthik, who copped up a lot of criticism for his batting, was back among runs with a vital 29-ball 58 against KXIP.

KKR’s bowling unit, however, has been sensational in the last two games, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat and the bowlers will be high on confidence when they take on a star-studded RCB line up.

On the other hand, the biggest positive for RCB is that captain Kohli has finally got his touch back after ordinary performances at the beginning of the season.

The 31-year-old was the lone batsman to put up a fight with a 39-ball 43 in the RCB’s 53-run loss to Delhi Capitals on Monday. He followed it up with a match-winning 90-run knock against CSK when other RCB batsmen, save opener Devdutt Padikkal, failed to put runs on the board.

Padikkal has been in good touch, but AB de Villiers, who played some exquisite knocks at the beginning of the tournament, has looked off colour in recent outings.

The big-hitting Aaron Finch has also struggled, failing to capitalise on his starts.

RCB bowling department, led by Yuzvendra Chahal, got a major boost with South African Chris Morris coming in to the side. The all-rounder was brilliant in his first appearance, bowling tight lines with a hint of away movement from right-handers.

Teams (from):

Kolkata Knight Riders: Dinesh Karthik (c/wk), Eoin Morgan, Shubman Gill, Tom Banton, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Nitish Rana, Rahul Tripathi, Kuldeep Yadav, Pat Cummins, Prasidh Krishna, Lockie Ferguson, Rinku Singh, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Shivam Mavi, Nikhil Naik, Chris Green, M Siddharth, Sandeep Warrier, Varun Chakravarthy and Siddhesh Lad.

Royal Challengers Bangalore: Virat Kohli (captain), AB de Villiers, Parthiv Patel, Aaron Finch, Josh Philippe, Chris Morris, Moeen Ali, Mohammed Siraj, Shahbaz Ahmed, Devdutt Padikkal, Yuzvendra Chahal, Navdeep Saini, Dale Steyn, Pawan Negi, Isuru Udana, Shivam Dube, Umesh Yadav, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Washington Sundar, Pavan Deshpande, Adam Zampa.

233,2020/10/11,"Complete performance, says Virat Kohli after win over CSK","RCB beat CSK by 37 runs in an IPL game which took them to eight points from six games.

Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Virat Kohli said the 37-run victory over Chennai Super Kings on a tricky pitch was one of their most complete performances in this IPL.

RCB beat CSK by 37 runs in an IPL game which took them to eight points from six games.

“It was one of our most complete performances. We got into a bit of a tricky position in the first half,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

“From there on, we pushed forward. We spoke during the second timeout (with the bat) that 140-150 would be good. Ended up getting more than that. It was a tricky pitch,” Kohli further added.

The skipper spoke about the need to build on the momentum as they have some back-to-back games coming up.

“Really pleased to get two points. We have back-to-back games coming up, so important to build momentum,” he said.

“It’s about understanding the conditions and respecting the game. Instead of trying to hit every ball into the second tier of the stadium. Having played so much cricket, especially T20 cricket, I have learnt that if you are set at the death, you can capitalize,” Kohli said.

Washington Sundar, who took two wickets in this three overs, said: “Glad to be given this role, I am very happy bowling in the powerplay especially against two great batsmen, that too against a team like CSK, to be able to perform well, I feel confident.

“So far it’s been going good. Everything has been working to the plan. I have also been planning a lot for different batsmen. Hopefully it works going deep into the tournament as well.”

Sundar praised pacer Chris Morris, who returned with three wickets in his first game this season.

“Morris was brilliant in his first game, Isuru bowled very well, Chahal took the crucial wicket of Mahi bhai. Everything went well today for us and I’m very happy.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/56vgm/article32825966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI10-10-2020000234BTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/complete-performance-says-virat-kohli-after-win-over-csk/article32825967.ece
234,2020/10/11,Sunil Narine reported for suspect action at IPL,"Kolkata Knight Riders’ West Indian spinner Sunil Narine has been reported for a suspect action during his team’s IPL clash against Kings XI Punjab here and another such instance could lead him to being barred from bowling in the league.

The 32-year-old picked up two wickets in his four overs during the match on Saturday, which KKR won by two runs defending 165.

“The report was made by the on-field umpires according to the IPL’s Suspected Illegal Bowling Action Policy. Mr Narine will be placed on the Warning List and is permitted to continue to bowl in the tournament,” read a statement from the IPL.

“Another report will result in Mr. Narine being suspended from bowling in the Dream11 IPL 2020 until cleared by the BCCI Suspect Bowling Action Committee,” it added.

In 2015, Narine served suspension from bowling in international cricket after his action was declared illegal by the ICC. But he was cleared to bowl in all formats in 2016 after undergoing corrective measures.

“After action correction, he has lost much of his sting as a bowler. Who knows may be it was desperation that he chucked in the last two games where KKR virtually won from nowhere. If he is smart enough, he won’t bowl those deliveries,” an IPL source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

His action was also reported during the 2018 Pakistan Super League but was cleared eventually.

Narine sharpened his batting skills after being reported multiple times.

However, in the last two IPL games, he has been very difficult to pick as Prabh Simran Singh and Nicholas Pooran found out at the death.

237,2020/10/11,"Footfall increases in Yercaud, hotel bookings yet to pick up","Yercaud, popularly known as ‘poor man’s Ooty’, is slowly returning to normalcy following relaxations in lockdown enforced to contain COVID-19. Though footfall to parks has improved, hotel owners say that bookings have not improved much yet.

Though tourists to the hill station must get an e-pass from the district administration and boating in Yercaud lake is restricted, visitors have started coming to the six parks that were reopened recently.

A rise in footfall to the parks under the Horticulture Department was noticed during the long weekend in first week of October. From October 2 to 4, cumulatively, the Anna Park collected ₹ 23,225, Lake Park ₹ 4,070, Rose garden ₹ 35,515, the two government botanical gardens ₹ 3,625 and the genetic heritage garden collected ₹ 24,470.

Taxi operators here said use of tourist vehicles was minimal as most of them came in personal vehicles and that too for a day. They said an increase in use of tourist vehicles could be expected only when bus services resumed.

Stating that hotel booking were minimal, Kalpanna Sivaraj, joint secretary, Tamil Nadu Tour Travel and Hospitality Association, expected the businesses to improve only when the e-pass restrictions were relaxed as majority of tourists to the hill station came from Bengaluru during weekends. She said occupancy was low at the moment and many hotels were forced to reduce their tariffs to attract customers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/cro1ea/article32829005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA12YERCAUD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/footfall-increases-in-yercaud-hotel-bookings-yet-to-pick-up/article32829006.ece
238,2020/10/11,Coimbatore district sees further decline in positivity rate,"As per current estimation, the case load is expected to decline further

Coimbatore district has registered a further decline in the positivity rate of COVID-19. Health Department officials said on Sunday that the district's positivity rate stood at 7.5 % as against 9 % - 9.5 % a week ago.

However, according to the Health Department, people should exercise caution and continue to follow safety guidelines in public places, public transportation facilities and workplaces among others.

The daily case load has also decreased in the district which was less than 400 for the third consecutive day on Sunday, they pointed out. As per their current estimation, the case load is expected to decline further.

“People should strictly follow the standard safety guidelines such as wearing mask and maintaining physical distancing in public places. Though COVID-19 case load in Tamil Nadu has seen a decline, the numbers remain high in neighbouring States such as Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. With inter-State travel restrictions relaxed, people should continue to exercise caution. People aged above 60 and those with co-morbidities should be more careful,” said a senior Health official to The Hindu.

The official added that early testing, upon sensing the symptoms of the COVID-19, was very important for early detection of the disease. This would help early initiation of Government protocol-based treatment.

The Health Department, district administration and the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation are also concerned about further possible spread of the disease through public transportation facilities and from busy places such as markets and bus stands. Officials said that the civic body has set up swab sample collection centres at selected bus stands considering this risk factor.

Urban areas of the Coimbatore district continue to dominate the daily case load. As per the estimation by the Health Department, 70 % of the new cases were from urban areas of the district that fall within the limits of Coimbatore Corporation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/c8qsa5/article32830032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB12PUBLIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-district-sees-further-decline-in-positivity-rate/article32828999.ece

240,2020/10/11,Nilgiris district administration takes stock of measures to tackle NE monsoon,"The Nilgiris district administration has begun preparing for any eventualities that might result due to rain brought by the Northeast monsoon.

Areas that are prone to landslips as well as flooding in previous years have already been identified and measures already in place to prevent loss of life and damage to property in these areas. A total of 283 areas have already been identified as being prone to landslips. Awareness campaigns are being conducted targeting communities in these areas so that they are aware of protocols that need to be followed in case of any emergencies.

The district administration stated that teams comprising staff from various departments have been formed to deal with emergencies due to the monsoon. These teams will be tasked with monitoring low-lying areas prone to flooding.

Moreover, 456 relief shelters have already been identified, where people who need to be evacuated from their homes can be sheltered. Officials will conduct inspections in each of these relief shelters to ensure that they have toilets, drinking water facilities and electricity.

In order to inform the authorities about any emergencies, a total of 2,529 people have been identified across the district to provide information about any emergencies.

241,2020/10/11,Udhagamandalam Municipality urged to desilt Kodappamund channel,"Residents living around the Kodappamund channel have demanded that the Udhagamandalam Municipality (UMC) carry out desilting work on the channel to prevent flooding of the low-lying areas around town.

Residents said that due to the channel not being desilted regularly before the monsoon, they face the threat of flooding their homes each year. R. Sumanth, a resident who lives near the ATC bus stand, said that sewage being let into the channel leads to many sections of the Kodappamund channel getting blocked, leading to a higher chance of flooding when it rain.

“Due to the channel being extremely polluted with the town’s sewage, the water when it enters our homes poses a health risk to residents. We have also seen these flooding events more commonly over the last few years due to more intense showers,” he added.

G. Janardhanan, president of the Ooty Public Awareness Association, said that the municipality should expedite work on overhauling the Underground Drainage (UGD) line work which was announced earlier this year. “Unless the sewage line is established, so that the town’s sewage is separated from the channel, these issues will keep arising every few months,” said Mr. Janardhanan.

He also said that stiff penalties should be imposed on businesses and residences that illegally divert their sewage into the channel. “There are certain choke points along the channel where due to garbage getting collected, are prone to water overflowing, like near the railway station. These places should be regularly desilted till a more permanent solution is found,” said Mr. Janardhanan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/o52h1j/article32828978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB12CHANNEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/udhagamandalam-municipality-urged-to-desilt-kodappamund-channel/article32828979.ece
242,2020/10/11,Delay in issuance of PDS smart cards troubles beneficiaries,"The imposition of lockdown has been cited as one of the reasons for the delay

The number of persons awaiting public distribution system (PDS) smart card and those who had applied for duplicate cards in the district has almost touched 4,000.

Sources in the district supply office said on condition of anonymity that the administration was yet to issue cards since January-February for both categories – those who had applied for new and duplicate card.

Though the imposition of lockdown was cited as a reason for the delay in the smart card distribution, there were other reasons as well, the sources said and pointed to the delay in getting the printer toner from the office of the Commissioner, Civil Supplies, to print the smart cards to underscore their point.

The sources said in printing the cards too there were problems in that a recent change in the software to print the cards had made it impossible to print addresses with more characters. This has forced the data entry operators to randomly cut parts of the addresses to accommodate the address in the smart card.

The other reason for the delay in the smart cards reaching the applicants was that the latter were unaware the change the State government had brought in to get duplicate cards – that the applicants would have to pay ₹ 20 towards a card.

The sources said the applicants, even if they had applied online for duplicate card, would have go to the taluk office concerned to pay the smart card fee. From the taluk offices across the district, the officials concerned send to the district supply office the list of applicants who had paid the fee so that the latter could print smart cards. And once the taluk offices get the smart cards the applicants would have to go once more to collect the cards.

Coimbatore Consumer Cause Secretary K. Kathirmathiyon said the administrative issues had made it difficult to get smart cards, particularly for those applying for duplicate cards. The State government should take steps to decentralise the purchase of printer toners to avoid delay in printing and disbursing smart cards.

Second, it should restrict the number of characters in the address columns so that the applicants typed the correct address and it was not left to data entry operators to randomly cut portions of address. This was more important as ration card served as an important address proof document.

Third, the government should introduce a system where applicants paid online the fee for getting duplicate cards. Besides, it could also add postage charges so that the smart cards reached the applicant’s door step.

Mr. Kathirmathiyon also wanted the district administration to represent the issues to the State government.

The District Collector could not be reached for his comments.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/i06s0x/article32830042.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB12SMARTCARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/delay-in-issuance-of-pds-smart-cards-troubles-beneficiaries/article32828970.ece
243,2020/10/11,Private ambulance driver helps Odisha couple take newborn to hospital,"A private ambulance driver on Saturday offered free ride to a migrant worker to take his critically ill new-born from Government Hospital, Annur, to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH).

A. Chiranjeevi of Annur, the private ambulance driver, said that the couple from Odisha approached him at Annur GH saying they wanted to rush the baby to CMCH. They told him that 108 ambulance might come late.

“I initially told them the charge for the trip. But seeing that the baby was ill, I offered them a free ride,” he said.

The ambulance left the GH at 12.45 p.m. and reached CMCH at 1.12 p.m. Mr. Chiranjeevi had also informed the police control room due to which the traffic signals were kept open accordingly.

Though the private ambulance driver managed to take the four-day-old male baby from Annur GH to CMCH covering 30 km in 27 minutes with the help of the police, the newborn died without responding to treatment late on Saturday. It died around 11 p.m.

S. Selvamuthukumar, GVK EMRI's programme manager for Coimbatore, the Nilgiris and Tiruppur, said that the baby’s parent had called 108 control room but he cut the call, reportedly in a state of panic, stating that he would call again. The parent then approached the private ambulance.

Mr. Selvamuthukumar said that the baby was born at Nambiyampalaym primary health centre in Tiruppur district on October 7. It was shifted to the neonatal ICU of the Tiruppur Medical College Hospital after delivery due to complications of umbilical cord having wrapped around the baby's neck in the womb.

“The mother and baby were reported missing from the neonatal ICU after three days. They reportedly went home and took the baby to Annur GH on Saturday after its condition deteriorated,” said Mr. Selvamuthukumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/private-ambulance-driver-helps-odisha-couple-take-newborn-to-hospital/article32827513.ece
244,2020/10/11,COVID-19 pandemic hits college admissions in Coimbatore,"Self-financing arts and science colleges in Coimbatore have approached the Bharathiar University seeking an extension of the deadline to admit students to graduate programmes.

The reason that the colleges have sought extension of the October 10 deadline is that they have been unable to fill seats, says a college secretary and adds that the demand is keeping open the admissions till the month end.

The colleges are citing the Madras University, which has October 30 as the deadline.

The reason for the colleges finding it difficult to fill seats is the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Plus Two result, admission process and the need for maintenance of physical distance and avoiding travel.

The restriction on travel means parents who accompany prospective students are unable to visit campus, interact with the faculty and have a look at hostel if they want one. And, when parents are forced to do all this online, they think it is better to admit students to a nearby institution, the secretary explains.

Echoing similar thoughts, a principal of a government-aided college says her college has not got the usual number of inquiries that it gets from parents from Madurai, Theni, and Ramanathapuram districts who want to admit their children in Coimbatore.

As a consequence, there has been a reduction from over 10 applications for a seat to five.

Another impact of the COVID-19 induced travel restriction is that parents from rural areas who usually prefer to meet face to face with faculty have their doubts cleared and seek suggestion on the right course for their children are unable to do so and feel uncomfortable doing the same over phone.

This is not withstanding the fact that the colleges have helpline on phone, social media platforms, etc.

A principal of a well-known self-financing college says even those colleges that are over 30 years old have taken a hit as only seats in popular courses like commerce and computer science are filled. Seats in physics and mathematics have taken a hit.

A reason for this is the sudden announcement of Plus Two result, forcing colleges to make last-minute arrangements for online admission.

As for colleges that are dependent on students from other districts in the State and Kerala, the problem is that they have been unable to engage agents or open admission offices, given the travel restriction that the governments imposed and the need for e-pass for travel.

This has resulted in at least 20 – 30% seats remaining vacant.

Another college secretary says the opening of government colleges in Thondamuthur, Mettupalayam and Valparai has also had an impact. If the Bharathiar University extends the deadline, the colleges hope to at least 10 to 20 seats more, he adds.

Vice-Chancellor P. Kaliraj says that the colleges are finding it difficult to fill seats and have asked for extension is true. The University will take a call on extension of admission deadline soon, he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/covid-19-pandemic-hits-college-admissions-in-coimbatore/article32827437.ece

The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) has been fined ₹50 lakh for not taking dust-control measures at a construction site here, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said Sunday. The minister, who was on a visit to inspect demolition sites at Netaji Nagar and Kasturba Nagar, noticed uncovered mounds of dust at the NCRTC site near Vikas Sadan.

The NCRTC is constructing a building of the rapid metro.

Mr. Rai said they have brazenly flouted dust-control norms despite strict directions from the government.

“I have issued directions to impose a fine of ₹50 lakh on NCRTC. Such disregard to air pollution will not be tolerated,” he said.

On Saturday, the Delhi government had imposed a fine of ₹20 lakh on the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) for violating dust control norms at a demolition site on Tansen Marg in New Delhi.

Directions were also issued not to carry out or restart any demolition activity without installing an anti-smog gun and taking other measures to prevent dust pollution at the project site.

The Delhi Pollution Control Committee had earlier asked FICCI and other bodies to stop work at six demolition and construction sites for not taking adequate steps to control dust pollution.

It is mandatory to install anti-smog guns at construction and demolition sites larger than 20,000 square meters, according to government guidelines.

The government has also imposed fines ranging between ₹20,000 and ₹5 lakh on 31 RMC plants for not taking measures to prevent dust pollution.

Eleven of these plants where violations were of serious nature have been told to stop work.

251,2020/10/11,Graveyard workers pay for infected man’s burial,"They spent ₹2,000 on arrangements after no one came forward to claim body

In a heart-warming gesture, an unidentified man who was found in a semi-conscious state in Okhla in September and later died of COVID-19 was given a burial at a graveyard by its two staffers.

Mohammed Shamim, a third-generation gravedigger at Delhi Gate’s Jadid Qabristan Ahle Islam, said he got a call from an AIIMS doctor seeking help to bury an unidentified man who had died of the deadly disease.

“The deceased was a Muslim. If we had not agreed, then he would have been cremated. The man deserved a respectable burial,” said Mr. Shamim, who spent around ₹2,000 on the arrangements.

On the afternoon of October 8, the body was brought to the graveyard by a police official and laid to rest.

A senior police officer said that on September 15, information was received at Okhla Industrial Area about a person, identified as Ajgar, being admitted at AIIMS Trauma Centre. “In his medicolegal certificate, the doctor mentioned that he was suffering from Tuberculosis,” the officer said.

On September 20, the man was shifted to Rajan Babu TB Hospital at Kingsway Camp for treatment. “At the hospital, he was in a semi-conscious state and said his name was Ajgar and he was a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Bijoli village,” the officer said.

A police official contacted counterparts in Bijoli and shared the man’s photograph, but he was allegedly told that no such person resides there.

On September 25, Ajgar passed away and his body was shifted back to AIIMS for postmortem. A COVID-19 test was conducted and he was found positive for the virus. “The body was not handed over to the police as he was infected,” the officer added.

Finally, 13 days after his death, the unidentified man was buried at the graveyard.

Probe initiated

The police said that inquest proceedings have been initiated and personnel are being sent to Bijoli for physical verification to gather information about the deceased.

Mr. Shamim said that since the outbreak of COVID-19, they had buried six-seven persons whose families were never traced.

252,2020/10/11,Sisodia reviews content of ‘Deshbhakti’ curriculum,"Work in final stages of preparation: govt.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia reviewed the content of the ‘Deshbhakti’ curriculum and chaired the third joint review meeting of a new board in addition to the new curriculum committee to take stock of the progress so far here on Saturday.

The work on introducing the Deshbhakti curriculum started last year after an announcement by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and it is in the final stages of preparation, the government said in a statement.

According to the government, the Curriculum and Board committees were constituted this July to recommend new curriculum for children up to the age of 14 and setting up of Delhi Examination Board. Both the committees are likely to submit their recommendations by mid-November.

“Assessment would be the basis of Deshbhakti curriculum. Understanding of the teacher as to where a child stands today and subsequently issues like inclusiveness, gender, different forms of discrimination, integrity, care for public property and natural resources, etc., would be the key to enable a child to become a true Deshbhakt,” Mr. Sisodia stated.

The new curriculum committee, which is mandated to recommend new curriculum for children below 14 years, presented the curricular design for enabling children in the age group of 3-8 with diversity of knowledge, competencies, values and attitudes. Along the similar lines, the committee will recommend curriculum for children in the age group of 8-11 and 11-14 as well.

“During the parent-teacher meetings, I have often seen teachers and parents talking only about the subjects and marks obtained by the students. Through our new curriculum and assessment practice, the conversation between the parents and teachers should shift to overall growth of the child,” he also said.

Similarly, the board committee, which is working on creating a new-age assessment system also gave an update on the progress so far. It proposed the structure of the new board along with its functions.

Mr. Sisodia asked the committee members to create tools for parents also, by which they can see the progress of their child. He said the era of one-time assessment, through a one-sitting exam is over now.

“We require a system where we are able to track the entire journey of a child, a 360° view, capturing different aspects of learning and it is possible to implement such system through effective use of technology,” he also said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sisodia-reviews-content-of-deshbhakti-curriculum/article32824288.ece

When the police reached the spot, they were told that one Manoj had already been taken out and rushed to a hospital. “The fire brigade reached the spot and pulled out the other two from the tank and they were rushed to a private hospital where they were declared brought dead,” Mr. Meena said.

“On Saturday, Mr. Manoj, a contracter, arrived with Devender to clean the tank. Devender went inside and felt uneasy and collapsed. Mr. Manoj followed him and fell inside too. Mr. Chawla went inside to save the two but met the same fate,” Mr. Meena said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/two-die-after-falling-into-septic-tank/article32824196.ece
254,2020/10/11,DU student murder: kin of accused a witness now,"She names uncle, brother as ‘killers’

A 20-year-old woman, whose friend was allegedly murdered by her family as they objected to their friendship, has become a witness in the case, the police said on Saturday.

A senior police officer said that the woman named her brother and her uncle as the killers of her friend Rahul Rajput (18), a resident of north-west Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar who was pursuing graduation from DU’s School of Open Learning and also tutored students.

“The girl is a witness in the case. She has not asked for protection so far, but if she moves an application, action will be taken,” said an officer privy to probe.

Meanwhile, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday met Rahul’s family and announced an ex-gratia of ₹10 lakh.

He added that the Delhi government will ensure that the culprits get strict punishment at the earliest by appointing prominent lawyers in the case.

The BJP, meanwhile, attacked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for remaining silent about the murder. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta met the family of the victim and appealed to the CM to provide ₹1 crore compensation to the family.

He also demanded that the matter be heard in a fast track court so the culprits are punished at the earliest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/du-student-murder-kin-of-accused-a-witness-now/article32824187.ece
255,2020/10/11,AAP to ‘gherao’ Haryana CM’s house today,"The AAP will ‘gherao’ Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s Karnal residence at 11 a.m. on Sunday, as a protest against “anti-farmer” laws passed by the BJP, the party said on Saturday.

“AAP is fighting against the anti-farmer and anti-labour laws passed by the BJP-ruled Central government. We are fighting on the streets and also against these Bills inside the Parliament. In the Haryana, BJP Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar always takes anti-farmer stands when the time of harvesting comes,” said AAP MP Sushil Gupta.

The AAP leader said that farmers are facing difficulties in selling paddy crops. In Haryana, 1,500-2,000 kg millet is produced on one acre of land, but farmers are not getting more than ₹850 per kg due to the “anti-farmer” policies of the BJP, said the MP.

“Farmers are constantly being harassed in the name of portal, e-payment, registration, gate pass of mandi and others. In the last 15 days, farmers had to take to the streets. AAP has decided that the farmers’ cell of the party will hold a ‘gherao’ of Haryana Chief Minister Shri Manohar Lal Khattar’s Karnal residence tomorrow [Sunday] at 11 a.m. All the volunteers are reaching Haryana to participate in this protest,” Mr. Gupta said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-to-gherao-haryana-cms-house-today/article32824173.ece
256,2020/10/11,Virus dampens festive cheer,"While the oldest and most popular Ramlilas stand cancelled, smaller idols, slashed budgets, restricted entry and live-streaming of rituals comprise the modest bouquet of muted Durga Puja celebrations across the Capital

The upcoming festive season will be a shadow of its usually glorious self because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the oldest, largest and most popular Ramlilas in Delhi have been cancelled, smaller idols, restricted entry, live- streaming of rituals, slashed budgets and abandoned cultural events will culminate in muted Durga Puja celebrations across the Capital.

Both renowned as much for the pomp as well as the traditional hues which draw thousands to sprawling venues each day when on display, Ramlilas and Durga Puja intersect on shashti or the sixth day of the Navratras. The Puja commences on this day and the combined festivities conclude together around Dussehra.

Ramlilas are scheduled to commence on October 17 and Durga Puja on October 22. While the former will conclude with Dussehra on October 25, Durga Puja will end a day later.

This October, however, both organisers and visitors are caught between the health scare due to the COVID-19 pandemic on one hand and lack of precise guidelines regarding organisational matters related to them to be issued by the Delhi government on the other.

So, Ramlila and Durga Puja organisers have decided to knock on the doors of local temples with larger-than-usual compounds, banquet halls and homes with reasonable room in their surface-level stilt parking for smaller renditions of what were, till last year, larger-than-life galas.

A file photo of Dussehra celebrations at Ramlila grounds in the Capital.

Big cancellations

“Ours is the oldest Ramlila in Delhi. This will be the fourth time that it is being cancelled in our 170-year history after 1948 due to the Partition, 1962 war [with China] and 1965 war [with Pakistan]. This [COVID-19] is a global problem and even the Olympics had to be deferred,” said Rajesh Khanna, general secretary of the Shri Ramlila Committee.

The SRC stages the event, which has its origins in Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar’s decision to patronise it during his reign, at the Ramlila Maidan near Delhi Gate followed by a parade of all the characters of the Ramayana through the bylanes of Old Delhi.

“Given the economic condition due to the pandemic, we did not even seek donations from patrons this year. We are still in the process of figuring out what to do and will probably telecast previous episodes from our programmes,” Mr. Khanna said.

Dheeraj Dhar Gupta, general secretary of the Shri Dharmic Lila, which has been organising the event at the Madhavdas Park in the Red Fort grounds since 1924, making it slightly younger than the Shri Ramlila Committee but the second oldest in the Capital, said that his committee too was mulling a similar alternative. “There seems to be no other choice than cancelling the event this year. We will exhibit episodes of the Ramayana instead,” he said.

Waiting for directives

While some Durga Puja committees are still waiting for government directives, most have already chalked out guidelines to be followed. The Delhi Durga Puja Samiti at Kashmere Gate, which is also the oldest in the city, will not be worshipping an idol this time — a first since 1911.

The organiser, Som Prakash Mitra said, “We are literally going back a hundred years this time considering this is the first time since 1911 that instead of worshipping the idol a “ghot puja” will be done. It has only happened for the first two years since this puja’s inception in 1910.”

“Even our practice of getting theatre artists and bands will be discontinued this year. Due to the current situation, we are also not forcing people for a donation. Everything will depend on the voluntary donations made by the members,” said Mr. Mitra.

The Matri Mandir in Safdarjung Enclave will also be dependent on voluntary donations and online streaming of rituals this year, said committee member Debasish Saha.

“While all rituals will be followed to the core there will be no idol this time. It will be a low-key affair and all rituals will be streamed online. This time, we are entirely dependent on voluntary donations and have also decided to donate the money among the needy, including the dhaakis and our regular cooks who are out of work this time,” said Mr. Saha.

The little fix

Ashok Goel Devraha, general secretary of the Delhi Dharmik Sangh which is an umbrella body that facilitates the organisers of Ramlilas, said traditional patrons were as certain of the fact that “something, no matter how small” needed to be organised as they were of the cap of 100 persons per religious gathering prescribed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, subject to the go-ahead of respective State governments, not being amenable to the staging of traditional celebrations.

“It is more or less clear that the Ramlila will not be able to manifest itself at the usual scale; so, we will either shift the venue of the celebrations from larger ones to temple courtyards, banquet halls and even large houses with stilt parking if required,” Mr. Devraha said.

“The consensus among organisers, so far, is that those who can make arrangements for small performances in such settings with volunteer actors should go ahead and do so. Gatherings revolving around the recitation of the Shri Ram Katha can be organised,” he said.

Rajesh Gehlot, chief patron of the Dwarka Sri Ram Leela Society which has been a traditional crowd-puller to its venue in Sector 10 for decades and saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi in attendance last year, said a cap of 100 people on an event which used to accommodate as many as 150 artistes on stage per se and provide employment to 1,000 people in total every year was just not feasible enough to work around.

“Ramlilas are not just about the stage and the performance but also the traditional mela [carnival] around them. Since the number of people permitted is even less than the artistes we are used to seeing on stage, we are thinking of organising a televised exhibition of the Ramayana at a banquet hall,” Mr. Gehlot said.

Not more than 12 people

The Purbanchal Bangiyo Samiti, an umbrella organisation of 38 Durga Puja samitis located across East Delhi has also decided to not allow more than 12 people at any given point during the day.

“The entire day will be divided into slots which people can pre-book. In each slot not more than 10-12 people will be allowed for darshan. Even those who visit the site will not be allowed to go up to the idol. Provisions will be made in a such a way that they can view the idol from the gate. Those below 16 years and above 65 years will not be allowed,” said Mrinal Kanti Biswas, general secretary of the Samiti. Mr. Biswas added that of the 38 pujas, only 12 were having idols made this time.

“On an average, each puja committee collects around ₹12-₹15 lakh each. This time for most it has been slashed to ₹1-₹1.5 lakh each. At the Milani Durga Puja in Mayur Vihar, whatever money is collected from our regular members will be utilised in contributing towards the weaker sections of society by distributing ration, sanitisers and masks,” said Mr. Biswas.

Budgets have also been slashed at the C.R. Park Kali Mandir as opposed to previous years. While last year it collected an estimated ₹1 crore, this year it has been brought down to ₹5-₹6 lakh.

Stating that several crowd-control measures will also be undertaken, Prodip Ganguly, a managing committee member said, “In regular times, the daily footfall would range between 1.5-2 lakh daily. It will become very difficult to restrict some and allow others. So it has been decided that no one will be allowed. Approximately, 100 people who are directly involved with the rituals will be present within the temple premises.”

“We have also decided that unlike other years, general bhog will not be distributed. It will be delivered to those who pre-book it in sanitised tiffin boxes. While all rituals will be followed and it will be live-streamed,” said Mr. Ganguly. The Arambagh Puja Samiti which usually rents a CPWD land will be relocating this year to a private hall.

Shanker Chakravarty, president of the Samiti said, “Considering the fact that celebrations have been scaled down, we have decided to book a private hall. Usually, the footfall used to be around 20,000 per day, but this time the responsibility is on us. Hence we decided to impose restrictions on the number of people who can attend. Only members and their families will be allowed. The priest will be kept in isolation and no devotee will have direct contact with him.”

Mr. Gehlot pointed out that while the most that visitors would confront due to the reduced scale of celebrations this year was disappointment, for innumerable others it would mean irrevocable economic hardship.

Actors, idol makers affected

“At least a thousand people are involved in every big Ramlila: the actors and stage artistes, those who make the three effigies, those involved in the arrangements and the ones who set up stalls for visitors. Smaller celebrations due to the pandemic will, unfortunately, mean no business for them this festive season,” he said.

Nitin Chauhan, now 34, has been playing the character of Demon King Ravana since he was 18 years old. A builder, director and talent manager by profession, Mr. Chauhan jovially said he comes from “a family of Ravanas”.

“My father, Santosh Chauhan has played Ravana in several Ramlilas followed by my elder brother Naveen. Having a family meal together these days ends up in disappointment and tears for us because we feel empty since we won’t be able to perform this year,” he said.

“While we can do with the fact that we will not be able to get contracts for performing this year because we are economically stable, I have had to send junior artistes from my group to events all over the country so that they can make ends meet. Some of them have gone to Ayodhya to participate in small Ramlilas to get by,” Mr. Chauhan said.

Idol makers, among others, are the ones critically affected by the curtailed celebrations. Gobindo Nath, a third-generation idol maker has received an order of eight idols as opposed to the 50-60 orders he received in previous years.

For Niranjan Chitrokar, an annual visitor to the Capital from West Bengal, the situation has been similar. “I used to bring a team of 12-13 people three months in advance due to the number of idols we had to make. This time only my son is accompanying me. Usually the earnings we made from this season helped us survive the entire year. With the condition this bad I don’t know how we will survive,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/90pggb/article32824145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DURGAIDOLSCRPARK1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/virus-dampens-festive-cheer/article32824155.ece

Delhi’s air quality continued to be in the ‘poor’ category on Saturday after it dropped to such level on Wednesday for the first time in over three months. However, it is expected to marginally improve to the reach the ‘moderate’ category on Sunday, said government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).

“The air quality index [AQI] is forecast to marginally improve to ‘moderate’ category for tomorrow. It is exepcted to further improve by Monday, but will remain in the ‘moderate’ category,” SAFAR said.

The agency also said that a shift in surface wind direction is forecast in Delhi from northwesterly to southeasterly by Monday and this could have a positive influence on the air quality during the week. Northwesterly winds bring in pollution from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana to the city.

The AQI in Delhi was 221 on Saturday, slightly up from 202 on Friday, as per Central Pollution Control Board data.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee on Saturday imposed a fine of ₹20 lakh on a demolition site of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Tansen Marg for violating dust pollution control norms, as per an official order.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vzt71q/article32824727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE11AQILEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhis-air-quality-likely-to-improve-today-safar/article32824101.ece
258,2020/10/11,Hindu Rao shifts 20 COVID patients to 2 govt. hospitals,"Doctors of civic hospital have given strike notice over salary

The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Saturday shifted 20 COVID-19 patients from its Hindu Rao Hospital to two Delhi government hospitals, said officials.

Earlier in the day, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said that officials had been directed to shift 20 COVID-19 patients admitted at Hindu Rao Hospital to any Delhi government hospital, as doctors and staff of the municipal-run hospital have given a notice for a strike because their salaries have not being paid for many months.

DDMA directives

Meanwhile, the North Corporation spokesperson said that the shifting was done on directions of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which is headed by L-G Anil Baijal, who is appointed by the Central government. The North Corporation is ruled by the BJP.

“The North Corporation shifted 20 patients to Delhi Govt hospitals — 17 to Lok Nayak Hospital and three to Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital. Three COVID patients are in the ICU and we have not shifted them as they are critical,” the north body spokesperson said.

“We were informed by the DDMA over the phone that there are few patients in our hospital and to shift them to Delhi government hospitals, so that Hindu Rao Hospital can provide other services,” the spokesperson said.

The Delhi government PRO did not respond to queries on whether the government had issued an order to shift the patients to Delhi government hospitals.

Earlier in the day, the Health Minister had said, “Hindu Rao Hospital is run by municipal corporation and doctors and staff have given notice for a strike. We have directed to shift COVID patients in the hospital to Delhi government hospital.”

He added that the corporation is not paying salaries of employees, despite having funds. “The BJP is doing politics, we have told them now that if you cannot run the hospital, then give the hospital to us. There is no deficiency of funds [in corporations]. They collect a lot of money in taxes, but there is no account of where it goes,” the Minister said during the press conference.

2,866 fresh cases

Meanwhile, the city reported 2,866 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 3,06,559, according to a health bulletin released on Saturday.

260,2020/10/11,Who were the Pandavas?,"Who were the Pandavas, and why were they so devoted to Krishna? The story begins with Indra’s visit to Kailasa, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. There he says Siva has not treated him with due respect, considering that he is chief of the celestials. Siva then shows him an underground chamber. In the chamber are the four previous Indras. Siva says that they were pushed there as punishment for their arrogance. Indra apologises to Siva, who says it is time for the five Indras to go to the earth. Siva says, “The five of you will be responsible for the death of many, and will thus reduce the pressure on the earth.” He then takes the five Indras to meet Vishnu. Once a person goes to Sri Vaikuntha, he cannot come back. So how could the five Indras go there and then come to the earth? Siva takes them not to Sri Vaikuntha, but to what is known as Karya Vaikuntha.

Siva requests Vishnu to take His next avatara, to relieve the earth’s burden. Siva says that during this avatara, the five Indras will serve Him with devotion. Vishnu sheds two hairs from his body — one white in colour and the other black. The black hair becomes Krishna, the son of Devaki. The white hair becomes Balarama, son of Rohini. The five Indras are born as the Pandavas. They had already seen Vishnu when Siva took them to Karya Vaikuntha, but now when they are born on the earth, they are further taught of His greatness by sages, and this makes them more attached to Him. Krishna tells Duryodhana, that He will not eat what Duryodhana offers, because the latter is the enemy of the Pandavas, Every person has five praanas — prana, apana, samana, udana and vyana, and all five have to be in equilibrium, for a person’s good health.

261,2020/10/11,Crop withers after sowing,"Farmers suspect spurious seed to be the reason

Paturi Mallesh is a farmer from Kasala village in Hatnoora mandal. He is a tenant farmer who took about as much as 22 acres on lease. He is paying a lease amount of ₹12,000 per acre.

In June, Mallesh purchased paddy seed of 22 bags by paying ₹900 a bag. Not only he, but several farmers from Kasala, Reddykhanapur, Chickmadur and Nandipet purchased the seed and cultivated the crop. Thoughcrop seemed to be healthy, there was no yield. It withered for reasons unknown to farmers.

Mallesh alone spent about ₹6 lakh on the 22 acres so far in addition to the lease amount which comes to a total of ₹2.64 lalk.

It was stated that in about 50 acres of land the paddy variety of 1010 was sown and all the farmers were at the receiving end. A few days ago, they reached the district headquarters and submitted a memorandum at the Collectorate. They also attached the copies of bills of seed purchased. As expected, the response from officials was ‘we will look into the matter.’

Ch. Manik Reddy, another farmer from Reddykhanapur, purchased for bags of the same variety seed and he had also lost crop on about four acres. “There is no response from officials or politicians. We have made a representation to MLA Ch. Madan Reddy, who promised to look into the matter. ‘Looking into the matter’ means keeping it aside. Can we get justice?” asked a farmer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/p1c3ny/article32828882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12HYMEDAKCROPONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/crop-withers-after-sowing/article32828883.ece
262,2020/10/11,Engineering web options postponed,"Programme to begin on October 18 as new courses are yet to be ratified

Engineering admission procedure cycle has been changed with the web options that were to start on Monday (October 12) getting postponed to October 18.

The decision has been taken as the officials are yet to finalise the number of seats to be displayed as universities are yet to ratify the permission for some new courses apart from ambiguity on the extension of fee reimbursement scheme to emerging technology courses that will be offered from this year.

New seats

About 19,000 new seats have been created at the B.Tech level in emerging streams of technology like Cyber Security (CS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and a few others.

A majority of them are from the three subjects that were earlier used to be offered at the postgraduate level.

The growing demand for these professionals in the job market has led to creation of these courses at the B.Tech level itself from this year. But universities are yet to give permission to various colleges that opted to offer these courses this year.

Officials expected that the process of permissions and affiliations would be completed by October 12 when they initially decided the dates.

Another issue was bringing them under the fee reimbursement scheme officially and officials were waiting for permission from the higher authorities.

A meeting of senior officials held with Special Chief Secretary Chitra Ramachandran decided to extend the date of web options as clarity lacked on the final number of seats to be included for the benefit of students. “Since we didn’t want to inconvenience the students we decided to extend the date for web options to October 18. The final list may be approved by October 16,” an official revealed.

Around 1.2 lakh seats have been approved by the AICTE for Telangana this year but the universities may give affiliation to 96,000 to 97,000 seats going by the indication from the higher authorities.

Revised schedule

As per the revised schedule, window for exercising the web options will be open from October 18 to 22. Options will be frozen on October 22 and the seats will be allotted on October 24.

Certificate verification for candidates who have already booked the slots online will start from October 12 and end on October 20. The online filing of basic information, payment of processing fee and slot booking for selection of helpline centres started on October 9 and will continue till October 19. Payment of tuition fee and self-reporting through website has to be done from October 24 to 28.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/engg-web-options-postponed/article32828863.ece
263,2020/10/11,Is Bheemeshwar Rao’s murder by Maoists a fresh challenge to Telangana police?,"Recently, DGP flew to Asifabad to motivate officials

The killing of Bheemeshwar Rao, who was said to be closely associated with the ruling TRS, by CPI (Maoist) in Mulugu district, is the first formidable challenge thrown by them to police forces in recent times.

A few months ago, police enhanced combing operations following inputs about movement of Maoist squads in northern Telangana districts abutting Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. In fact, the Telangana Intelligence department and local police are continuously keeping tabs on Maoists.

It it not an exaggeration to say that police had the upper hand in the ongoing battle with the outlawed Maoists for the past few years. Police had to step up their operations after movements of Maoists squads were noticed in Asifabad district.

During the searches, three or four exchanges of fire took place.

Bhaskar alias Adellu, Maoist State Committee member, was believed to have escaped from police during these exchanges of fire.

Following this, DGP M. Mahender Reddy flew to Asifabad and had a series of meetings with the field-level officers, apparently to motivate them and plan operations to check intrusion of Maoists.

Within last few weeks, eight Maoists were neutralised by police forces in ‘exchanges of fire’ reported in Asifabad, Bhadradri Kothagudem and Mulugu districts.

But the killing of Bheemeshwar Rao by Maoists in Venkatapuram mandal came as a jolt to the police forces who stepped up combing operations with their elite commando forces like Greyhounds.

The victim was not a top leader of the TRS or an influential person locally.

Yet the murder by Maoists in Venkatapura mandal assumed significance since top police officials of Telangana State and Central Reserve Police Force met recently in Venkatpur to formulate strategy to check Maoists.

Police sources said the killing was executed by Bhadradri Kothagudem East Godavari (BKEG) area committee secretary M. Jogulu alias Sudhakar.

It is yet to be ascertained if Sudhakar was physically present when the plot was executed.

However, it is believed that a group of six militia members from Chattisgarh participated in the killing.

The victim’s family members told the police that ‘Maoists in plain clothes’ came to their house in the dead of night.

One of the family members said that though a couple of Maoists were carrying firearms, one of them carrying a knife stabbed Rao to death. It is suspected that by the time the local police learnt about the killing, the Maoists would have crossed Telangana border and disappeared into Chattisgarh forests.

In the past one year, presence of the Maoists in northern Telangana districts was confined to their movements now and then.

The major violence perpetrated by them was the alleged killing of an MPTC member Srinivasa Rao in mid-Sileru area of Charla mandal.

Barring that, no violent incident involving them was reported in the area.

Recently, they blew up land mines on the roads at a couple of places near mid-Sileru project area.

TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy alleged that Telangana has turned worse than Uttar Pradesh in terms of atrocities against Dalits and warned the State government not to remain a mute spectator to the rising attacks on them.

Mr. Reddy and a team of Congress leaders met Dalit families who were target of attacks in the State at Gandhi Bhavan on Sunday and distributed ₹50,000 each, donated by former Medchal MLA Kichennagari Lakshma Reddy. The programme was organised by TPCC SC Department chairman Preetam.

Family members of a farmer, Narasimha, from Gajwel constituency, who committed suicide, explained how the government officials forcibly took away their land that allegedly drove him to suicide. Similarly, family members of Rajababu of Mallaram in Bhupalpally district, claimed that some TRS leaders were behind his brutal murder.

The TPCC chief also spoke to the father of a 13-year-old Dalit girl who was set ablaze after she resisted a rape attempt. “A total of eight Dalit families who had faced atrocities like attempt to rape, murder, abetment to suicide, grabbing of land or houses, shared their grievances. And we heard them,” Mr. Reddy said.

‘Discriminations galore’

He alleged that Dalits were being subjected to discrimination, torture and other kind of atrocities. He also accused the TRS government of taking away the land of poor Dalits forcibly. Poor Dalits girls are being raped and the government was not taking any action to stop such incidents, he charged.

The TPCC chief promised that the Congress would fight to get justice for them. AICC secretary A. Sampath Kumar, TPCC vice-president and ex-MP Dr. Mallu Ravi and other leaders were also present.

He reminded that KCR had promised to make a Dalit CM if voted to power but ignored the promise after coming to power in 2014. He did not even induct a single Dalit minister then but had inducted several ministers from his own community into his cabinet and other top positions in the government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/1cgkcc/article32828785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-CONG-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-worse-than-up-in-dalit-horror-cong/article32828782.ece

Mellifluous singing, energetic folk dances, and soulful music uplifted the mood of the audience. Over 400 officer trainees from across the State, and senior officers, faculty, and staff of the institute witnessed the virtual event.

In his remarks, director general of MCR HRD Institute B.P.

He applauded them for mobilising and donating an amount of over ₹1 lakh to five folk artistes of Telangana.

Additional DG of the institute Harpreet Singh said, “Continuous development of careers, till retirement and beyond, should be their ultimate aim, rather than succumbing to a sense of complacency.”

267,2020/10/11,Trump fan dies of cardiac arrest,"Went into depression soon after the US President tested COVID positive

An ardent fan of US President Donald J. Trump died of a massive cardiac arrest at Toopran in Medak district on Sunday.

Bussa Krishna (32), a native of Konne village in Bacchannapet mandal of Jangaon district, was worried over Trump’s health as soon as he heard that the US President tested COVID positive.

Four years ago, Krishna turned his modest house in the village into a shrine for Mr. Trump. He installed a life-size statue of Mr. Trump and started worshipping it, after the former appeared in his ‘early morning’ dream.

“Every year on June 14 (Trump’s birthday), Krishna used to perform special poojas and Annadanam in his temple. He used to distribute fruits, sweets and chocolates as well,” a villager told The Hindu.

Krishna, a small-time businessman, lost his wife during child birth.

Recently, he went to Toopran, which is his maternal grandmother’s house. Ever since Mr. Trump tested positive, Krishna went into depression and was not eating and sleeping properly.

Despite his family members counselling him that there was nothing to worry about the President and he would recover soon, he did not change.

“He was not having food or proper sleep,” Krishna’s uncle B. Ashok said.

He said that the ‘superfan’ spent about ₹14 lakh to construct the temple and another ₹80,000 to see Mr. Trump in Ahmedabad during his India visit in February.

“His only dream was to meet Trump, but he left the world without fulfilling it,” another villager said.

Though villagers used to make fun of him for building the Trump temple, Krishna never took their comments seriously and worshipped and admired the President as his god.

On several occasions, he had arguments with villagers and made a point that like others pray to Lord Rama, Krishna and Shiva, he offered his prayers to the President of a superpower.

The devotee, who was popular as ‘Trump Krishna’ always used to carry Mr. Trump’s photograph in his bag, and wore a ‘Trump T-shirt’.

Days before his death, Krishna released an ‘emotional video’ in which he stated that he was praying to other gods for the good health of Mr. Trump.

“He (Mr. Trump) is my god and I love him so much. He must recover very soon,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/trump-fan-dies-of-cardiac-arrest/article32828771.ece
268,2020/10/11,"CWC advises for pre-depletion of Krishna Basin dams in TS, AP","Heavy inflow expected following intense rainfall in the catchment areas

The Central Water Commission (CWC) has issued an advisory to several reservoirs in the Krishna Basin in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for pre-depletion of water with the forecast of heavy inflow following intense rainfall in the catchment areas.

Accordingly, the authorities of Srisailam dam resumed release of water through the spillway by lifting two crest gates for 10-foot height each to allow about 56,000 cusecs of water. In addition, another 27,000 cusecs of water was also being let into the river after power generation in the right bank power house of AP.

The spillway discharge at Srisailam was stopped in the early hours of October 6 after the inflows depleted. The reservoir was getting nearly 73,000 cusecs of inflows from Krishna, Tungabhadra and Handri rivers as of Sunday night (8 p.m.).

“The CWC issued an advisory for Narayanpur, Jurala, Srisailam, Musi and Pulichintala projects and also for Prakasam Barrage to take up necessary pre-depletion “in order to flooding in the downstream”, irrigation authorities said. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is forecast for north interior Karnataka, Telangana and AP for the next four days and the intensity of rainfall in the catchment areas is expected to get good inflows into the dams starting from Monday, the CWC indicated.

Water storage in all the dams is being maintained at full reservoir level or little below the FRL for the last few days although spillway discharge of flood has been stopped in the early hours of October 4 at Nagarjunasagar and on the night of October 4 at Jurala.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cwc-advises-for-pre-depletion-of-krishna-basin-dams-in-ts-ap/article32828590.ece
269,2020/10/11,Panther which prowled around Himayatsagar caught,"Its appearance under the Katedan bridge in May this year created a commotion, from where it had escaped

A male panther, which has kept the forest officials on tenterhooks and residents in fear by making the semi-urban environs of Himayatsagar reservoir its home, has been successfully trapped on Saturday night.

The cat has been prowling the Rajendranagar area for the last five months, making occasional appearances and leaving its trail behind. In May this year, its appearance under the Katedan bridge created a commotion, from where it had escaped into a private farm in Shamshabad pursued by the Forest officials and the police, and disappeared from there.

A fortnight later, its image was caught in a CCTV camera of the Greyhounds training centre in Rajendranagar limits, while the feline was crossing into the Gaganpahad forest area. While the villagers around Himayatsagar have been vouching occasional panther sightings later too, foresters have not confirmed it. Any number of cages set up with bait went futile.

On Friday, upon receiving information about killing of two calves in a private land at Premavathipet village of Rajendranagar, officials rushed to the spot and confirmed the pug marks of the panther. They arranged two cage traps using the carcasses of the very kills as baits, and installed 10 camera traps too at the location by Saturday evening.

On Sunday morning, they checked the location to find the panther growling inside one of the two trap cages. The animal has since been shifted to the Nehru Zoological Park, where it is being treated for minor bruises incurred during its attempt to escape from the metal cage, officials informed. The six-year-old panther will be kept under observation for two days, after which it will be released into the wild, they informed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2td5qc/article32827379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy11Panther,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/panther-which-prowled-around-himayatsagar-caught/article32827380.ece
270,2020/10/11,More eyes on Hyderabad: Government to step up CCTV surveillance,"With 3L cameras, Hyderabad is 16th most surveilled city in the world

The sixteenth most snooped city in the world, Hyderabad is in the process of climbing up a few more notches, with the Telangana government issuing express orders to install CCTV cameras at several more locations and vantage points in the metropolis.

In a recent survey conducted by a UK firm Comparitech, Hyderabad with its three lakh public CCTV cameras has bagged the dubious distinction of being the only Indian city in the top 20 most surveilled cities in the world. In fact, it is one of the two cities outside China, the other one being London. The survey mentioned in its report that little correlation was found between the number of public CCTV cameras and crime or safety aspect.

Unmindful of the observation and stressing that there have been studies establishing clear, direct correlation between CCTV surveillance and reduction in crime, the government has gone ahead with its mission of installation of more such third eyes.

Municipal Administration & Urban Development (MA&UD) Principal Secretary Arvind Kumar has issued the orders on Wednesday, directing GHMC and other urban local bodies (ULBs) within ORR, HMDA, HMRL, South Central Railway, TSRTC, TSIIC, HGCL, and several other departments, to install CCTV cameras at various locations. A blanket deadline of one month has been issued to all the departments for fulfilment of the orders.

While it has been stipulated that the cameras should be installed only in consultation with the Police department and integrated with the existing network of the Police, the responsibility of installation, operation and maintenance rests with the respective departments only. The Town Planning wing of the GHMC, and the Directorate of Country and Town Planning (DTCP) have been asked to insert mandatory provision for installation of surveillance cameras in the building permission rules under the TS-bPASS.

Accordingly, installation of the cameras will be made mandatory for all structures built in over 600 square yards of land, and all apartment complexes, shops though they are within the 600 square yards limit, besides all layouts.

Instructions have been issued to bring in all the proposed Integrated Township Projects too in the ambit immediately.

The exhaustive list of locations where camera surveillance has been made a norm include all notified slums, all 2BHK colonies, Basti Dawakhanas/UPHCs/government hospitals, metro rail stations and select pillars on metro routes, MMTS stations, railway stations, buses, bus depots, bus bays, bus shelters, entry points of all religious places, lakes and parks, vehicular underpasses, select locations on several roads, all IT parks, and institutional buildings within IT parks, comprehensive garbage transfer stations, all shelter homes, night shelters, orphanages, social welfare hostels, all paying guest accommodations, hostels, and educational institutions, all IALAs, petrol pumps, ORR interchanges, logistic parks, all wholesale markets, Rythu Bazars, and other retail outlets of the Marketing department, street vending zones, colony level offices of TSSPDCL, Mee Seva centres, all shop fronts, cabs run by cab aggregators, and even facades of public toilets by the road.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/d68e0q/article32824418.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10-CCTVCAMERAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/more-eyes-on-hyderabad-government-to-step-up-cctv-surveillance/article32824406.ece
271,2020/10/11,Hyderabad flash flood leaves behind a sandy trail,"Motorists struggle to navigate slippery roads; GHMC staff clear the mess with small hand tools

The heavy downpour on Friday that dumped 15 centimetres of rain in parts of Hyderabad also left behind tonnes of sand on the roads in its wake. Motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, had a tough time balancing their vehicles the following morning as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation workers raced to remove the heaps of sand from the roads.

At Toli Chowki, Shaikpet Nala, Jyothi Nagar, Filmnagar, Banjara Hills Road no. 10, Khairatabad, Gudimalkapur, Nampally and many other areas of the city, civic workers and contractors had to deal with piles of sand in the daytime.

Areas of the city which reported water inundation on Friday evening were the worst-affected. “Kindly send your team to Toli Chowki Main Road,Meraj Colony,Galaxy Theatre,Nadeem Colony. Please also send at Ahmad Nagar Road and Habib Nagar,” Hyderabad Member of Parliament Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted on Friday evening. These areas had piles of sand after the water was drained.

“This is the third vehicle we are using for moving the sand,” said a worker filling up a small cargo vehicle near Shaikpet Nala. Even after moving a large quantity of sand, the road remained dangerously slippery.

At Khairatabad, a photo blogger captured three GHMC sanitation workers using small hand tools to push the sand into piles. “GHMC staff at work -They need better tools,” wrote Sanjay Borra about the workers.

By evening, though the sand was removed, commuters had to deal with dry dust particles floating in the air.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2gd06w/article32824393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10-RAIN-PTI09-10-2020000242B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabad-flash-flood-leaves-behind-a-sandy-trail/article32824384.ece

274,2020/10/11,Buzz back on streets as citizens reclaim public spaces,"Tourist spots slowly witnessing rise in footfall; crowds return to the Charminar

It looks like business as usual near Charminar as throngs of people mill around the monument, haggle with the vendors, drink tea and click photographs of the monument.

“Earlier thousands of people would come. Now, we have about 200 people visiting everyday. On October 2, we had approximately 300 people visiting the monument,” says an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) official at the site.

It is not just Charminar and its surrounding areas that make it appear as the worst of COVID pandemic is behind us. Indira Park, Lumbini Park, Necklace Road, Durgam Cheruvu park, the cable stayed bridge, malls and other public places, are seeing large number of people thronging them. The park abutting Osman Sagar lake has been closed for the past few months, but that has not stopped people from driving to the edge of the lake and inquiring about the park, according to officials at the reservoir.

The crowd at Durgam Cheruvu bridge shows how citizens are trying to embrace the outdoors. The walkway on one side of the bridge is perpetually jammed through the day and even evening. “The numbers go up as it gets darker. Those nearest the bridge do more business than us,” says the owner of a tiffin centre that has popped up a month back on the stretch near the bridge. The sidewalk is now a buzzing business centre where snacks, tea and coffee vendors have appeared out of nowhere and are patronised by the visitors to the bridge.

Even the Golconda Fort has seen higher footfalls from the time it reopened a few weeks back. “We used to have a few thousand visitors per day. Now, the numbers are in hundreds. On October 2 holiday, we had 1,200 visitors,” said an ASI official.

Part of the reason for low number of visitors at these national sites is due to the zero-contact ticketing process. Visitors can either book online or scan the QR code at the site, pay digitally and flash the coded ticket for entry. At Chowmahalla Palace, which re-opened on October 3, the number of visitors is low. “We are getting under 100 per day in comparison to 600-1,200 visitors before the lockdown,” said a staffer at the palace.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/abeb4x/article32824310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10-PTI02-10-2020000204B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/buzz-back-on-streets-as-citizens-reclaim-public-spaces/article32824295.ece

Kishan Reddy said on Saturday.

The present facility built on a 50-acre land, earlier designated by the State government for Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), would be further expanded by 150 acres to house a range of professional and patient-centric services. The State had made the land allocation recently, he said.

Mr. Reddy, who was here on a surprise visit, took stock of the hospital development, its services in the wake of COVID-19, academic progress and reviewed hospital expansion plans with officials from AIIMS and the district.

According to the plan, Mr. Reddy said 10 acres would be earmarked for rural health centre, a separate AYUSH department would be set up, and adequate staff and advanced equipment appropriate for the centre would be provided.

A native of Narayanganj district in Bangladesh, she illegally entered India 14 years ago and married Anjaneyulu, who hails from Miryalaguda of Nalgonda district.

279,2020/10/11,"Hamilton wins Eifel Grand Prix, equals Schumacher's record of 91 victories","The six-time champion put his troubles in Russia last time out behind him with a controlled win on F1's return to the Nurburgring circuit for the first time since 2013

Lewis Hamilton equalled Michael Schumacher's all-time record 91 Formula One wins on Sunday with an Eifel Grand Prix victory that catapulted the Mercedes driver closer to a seventh world championship.

While the Briton triumphed at the Nuerburgring, the German circuit where Ferrari great Schumacher won five times, team mate Valtteri Bottas suffered a huge hit to his title hopes with a first retirement of the season.

Hamilton, celebrating his seventh win of the season, is now 69 points clear of the Finn in the standings with six rounds remaining.

Red Bull's Max Versteppen finished second, and took a bonus point for fastest lap, with Australian Daniel Ricciardo third for Renault in his first podium since 2018 when he was at Red Bull.

Schumacher's son Mick, the Formula Two leader who could be racing against Hamilton next season, presented the Briton with one of his father's red helmets from his second stint in F1 with Mercedes.

“Congratulations and this is on behalf of all of us. A great achievement, really,” said Mick, whose father suffered serious head injuries in a 2013 skiing accident and has not been seen in public since.

“Thank you so much, it's such an honour,” said Hamilton before stepping up onto the podium at the circuit closest to Schumacher's boyhood home in Kerpen. “I don't even know what to say.

280,2020/10/11,"No let-up in COVID-19 cases in Ernakulam as 1,228 more test positive","1,036 people recover from disease

For the second day in a row, over a thousand people in the district have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Of the 1,228 newly infected persons, the source of infection of 160 people remains untraced. A total of 1,032 people have contracted the infection through local contact. Eight health workers have been infected.

The number of recoveries also crossed the 1,000-mark on Sunday, with 1,036 people testing negative on the day.

Around 30,844 people remain in quarantine in the district. The total active caseload stands at 12,804. At the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery, which has the capacity to treat about 300 patients, 246 patients are currently admitted. At PVS Hospital, another COVID-19 facility, 48 patients are being treated. At private hospitals in the district, 695 patients are being treated, while 9,041 people remain in isolation at home. Around 1,470 people are at first-line treatment centres in the district.

For testing, 2,747 samples were collected from government and private facilities. The figure has dipped from over 7,900 samples collected on Saturday and 5,511 samples sent for testing on Friday.

About 55 people have tested positive from Thrikkakara, 53 people from Fort Kochi, 38 from Mattancherry, 31 from Thripunithura, 34 from Chengamanad and 41 from Cheranalloor. Perumbavoor, Muvattupuzha, Rayamangalam, Palluruthy and Kumbalangi recorded over 20 new cases each on Sunday.

Private hospitals

At all private hospitals in the district, 10% of the beds set aside for COVID-19 patients would be brought under the Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padhathi (KASP), the government’s healthcare scheme, said Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. The rates for COVID-19 treatment have been capped for hospitals empanelled as part of the scheme. While a few hospitals had already been empanelled for COVID-19 treatment, at present all private hospitals had been directed to offer at least a few beds under government rates, said Dr. Numpeli. If the KASP beds were set aside, about 200 ICU beds and 50 ventilators would be available at private hospitals at government-fixed rates, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/no-let-up-in-covid-19-cases-in-ernakulam-as-1228-more-test-positive/article32828562.ece
281,2020/10/11,Lottery vendors being taken for a ride,"Tampering of tickets rampant in Ernakulam

In his 30 years as a lottery vendor, N.S. Simon, 56, from Nileeshwaram, was never cheated till a man successfully sold him four dummies as prize-winning lotteries last month.

After a hiatus of a year when he took a break for cancer treatment, Simon was back selling lottery tickets when a man on a two-wheeler stopped him on the tracks like a long-lost acquaintance on September 22.

“He wanted to know why I was not around and then asked me whether I could encash four tickets for which he had won ₹1,000 each. Since he acted like an acquaintance, I did not suspect any foul play and paid ₹3,600 in cash and issued tickets worth ₹400,” he said.

But he was in for a shock when the District Lottery Office returned the tickets, saying that the ticket numbers were tampered with. “Who would have thought that people would even cheat a cancer patient,” bemoaned Simon. Since then, he had paid the money back to the dealer in small lots.

Cheating of unsuspecting lottery vendors, especially the aged and the sick, using the facade of tickets having won small prize money seems to be quite rampant in the district. Twin ploys have emerged as the popular routes for such cheating — tampering to match the number of winning tickets as published in the media and outright forgery of making colour photocopies of such tickets.

“These fraudsters never directly approach agencies, knowing fully well that they are likely to be caught. So, they cunningly choose poor vendors who can be easily fooled,” said A.V. Prakashan who runs a lottery agency at Kalady from whom Simon bought the tickets.

Tampering of tickets is so skilfully done that it is hard to detect with the naked eye, while forged tickets rival even the original ones in appearance, and in some cases, even pass the vetting using scanners.

Meanwhile, Lottery Traders Union said it was seized of the matter and had raised it with the Lottery Department. “Bar codes have been issued as an additional security feature, while vendors have been given lens to closely verify the tickets. We have held awareness classes and asked vendors to avoid such payments as far as possible and instead direct such people to agents,” said Shaji Edappally, district president of the union.

Senior Lottery Department sources said such complaints come up at the monthly monitoring cell meetings convened in the presence of the District Collector, and the District Lottery Officers concerned lodge police complaints.

However, poor vendors end up losing what little of their hard-earned money.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/lottery-vendors-being-taken-for-a-ride/article32824633.ece
282,2020/10/11,Neighbourhood groups help the elderly enjoy the joys of comraderie,"NHG holds Google meets for members in the wake of the pandemic

For 63-year-old Pushpavally from Maneedu panchayat, her retired life assumed a new meaning after joining a neighbourhood group (NHG) for the elderly three years ago.

Among the youngest in a group of 16, she was made the president, and since then she has been busy holding monthly meetings and taking care of three different micro-enterprises of her NHG till the pandemic put brakes on them.

“Corona has hit the market for our products a bit, but that is manageable, since we have local demand. What we miss the most are interactions during our meetings held twice a month. The meetings were always a lot of fun with singing and dancing and often overshot the supposedly two-hour duration,” said Ms. Pushpavally.

The meetings have remained suspended since February, and M.V. Yakub, a 66-year-old retired postman, looks back at them with so much longing. “At a time when neighbourly relations were not once they used to be, the meetings were occasions for people of our age to sit and reminisce about our past and share joyful moments by celebrating birthdays and wedding anniversaries,” he said.

It was on realising the significance of meetings for the elderly that the Kudumbashree started weekly Google meets around a fortnight ago, and they were received with great enthusiasm.

“We are accommodating as many members as possible in the meetings, though those without smartphones cannot join. We are also urging participants to educate fellow members on how to join the meets considering that they may be able to better communicate among themselves,” said Ponni Kannan, Kudumbashree district programme manager.

Google meets are among a slew of services organised by the Kudumbashree for the elderly in the wake of the pandemic.

Under the Grand Care project, being implemented in association with the Department of Women and Child Development, the Kudumbashree has been reaching out to the elderly to enquire after their well-being and offer psychological support. A mobile application-driven project was facilitated by local body-specific data on the elderly.

“We have deployed at least one resource person for a panchayat who, among other things, create awareness about the need for proper quarantine and reverse quarantine and ensure delivery of essentials, especially medicines. In individual cases beyond the capabilities of resource persons, our community counsellors take over,” said Arathy Aravind, district programme manager, Startup Village Entrepreneurship Programme.

So effective and frequent has been the communication that many elderly now personally contact the resource persons when faced with problems.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/e5omr3/article32824702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/zoomki09,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/where-the-elderly-enjoy-the-joys-of-comraderie/article32824703.ece
283,2020/10/11,NHGs run by the elderly thrive in district,"2,977 groups formed across 101 local bodies in five years

Five years after they were set up on an experimental basis in a single block panchayat in the district, the neighbourhood groups (NHGs) exclusively for the elderly have turned out to be a resounding success with their number soaring to 2,977 across 101 local bodies in the district.

Initially, the Kudumbashree formed 441 NHGs on a pilot basis in just five panchayats in the Mulanthuruthy block panchayat — Edakkattuvayal, Maneedu, Mulanthuruthy, Amballoor and Udayamperoor — under the Elderly Inclusion project of the National Rural Livelihood Mission in November 2015.

Unlike other Kudumbashree NHGs, which are the preserve of women alone, NHGs for the elderly were open to both men and women aged 60 and above. In due course, the number of beneficiaries under the project rose to 6,548 and they collectively set up 206 micro enterprises.

The main goal of the project was to provide a better social security net for vulnerable elders in the rural areas through health care, social protection, psycho-social care, livelihood support and other age-appropriate services in order to ensure an active, healthy, and dignified life.

“The success of the project encouraged the formation of such elderly NHGs across the district cutting across rural and urban divides. We were in the process of scaling up their activities and forming micro enterprises and joint liability groups for group farming when the pandemic set in and disrupted the activities,” said Ponni Kannan, district programme manager who is also in charge of the NHGs.

The NHGs attracted men and women from all walks of life, except a small relatively affluent section of people. Notwithstanding the fact that positions in these groups are reserved for women, men were happy to be part of the collective.

The groups set up at Mulanthuruthy have been regular with the repayment of funds allocated for various initiatives till the pandemic played havoc with their disciplined functioning and their regular weekly meetings.

They have also been very effective with the mobilisation of thrift funds and their utilisation for their own activities like pleasure trips and helping out the needy among their own members with interest-free loans.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/nhgs-run-by-the-elderly-thrive-in-district/article32824694.ece
284,2020/10/11,Local bodies in Ernakulam to segregate non-biodegradable waste,"Clean Kerala Company not to receive unsegregated waste owing to logistical issues

Local bodies in Ernakulam will have to step up segregation of non-biodegradable waste, as Clean Kerala Company has decided not to collect unsegregated waste from Saturday.

The government agency has informed the Haritha Kerala Mission (HKM) that it will enter into agreements with local bodies for collection of segregated waste. Civic bodies that passed the government test on solid waste management will sign the agreement with the company in the first phase, according to officials.

Clean Kerala Company decided not to receive unsegregated waste, as it had been causing logistical and financial strain on the already burdened waste collection and transportation mechanism amid the pandemic crisis. The government had asked local bodies to hand over non-biodegradable waste to the company after material collection facilities in panchayats were filled up with piles of unsegregated waste from March-end.

The Environment Department had permitted Clean Kerala Company to transport waste to the hazardous waste treatment facility of Kerala Enviro Infrastructure Ltd. at Ambalamedu as a temporary measure. But the Central Pollution Control Board had warned against dumping solid waste at landfill sites earmarked for hazardous waste.

The government wanted local bodies to reap the advantages of increasing their earnings through sale of segregated waste. The authorities had published rates per kg of each non-biodegradable item. Haritha Karma Sena members are now being encouraged to cash in on the demand for segregated materials among vendors involved in recycling.

Civic bodies can bring down the expenditure for transporting unsegregated waste, as Clean Kerala Company will impose additional charge for such waste. Local bodies will also have to pay up for handing over waste that cannot be recycled to the company. A list of such waste materials will be published in advance by the company.

Local bodies will get money from the company for segregated waste stored at the material collection facilities. It will be transferred to the bank account mentioned by civic bodies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/b41pz/article32824683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11-KI-WASTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/local-bodies-to-segregate-non-biodegradable-waste/article32824684.ece
285,2020/10/11,Handbook comes in handy for green volunteers,"It elaborates on the role and opportunities available for green volunteers

A handbook published by the Suchitwa Mission has come in handy for members of the Haritha Karma Sena involved in collection and segregation of non-biodegradable waste.

The book elaborates on the role and opportunities available for green volunteers. The Local Self-Government Department has rolled out training programmes for them in various districts to explore the various avenues available for income generation. In Ernakulam, the lead members of the various Haritha Karma Sena units had attended the first phase of the training programme.

“Besides highlighting the role played by them in ensuring proper collection of non-biodegradable waste, the handbook has included detailed information on their potential to create a culture of sorting and segregating such waste at source itself. The training programme had focused on the importance of segregation of non-biodegradable waste, as it enhanced the income generation capabilities of Haritha Karma Sena members,” said Sujith Karun, district co-ordinator, Haritha Keralam Mission.

The handbook has included the estimated prices of recyclable waste, besides pointing out the value-addition ventures that could be undertaken by green volunteers. They get user fee for collecting waste from households and commercial establishments. The members also get money after the sale of recyclable waste to agencies like Clean Kerala Company.

Haritha Karma Sena volunteers can also take up production of cloth bags and masks. They can assist families who wish to set up biogas plants, to treat biodegradable waste at source. Sena members have been trained in repairing such units. The marketing of manure from these systems can also be undertaken by green volunteers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/handbook-comes-in-handy-for-green-volunteers/article32824652.ece
286,2020/10/11,Survey over for water transport system,"Six major canals in the city to be revived under IURWTS project

Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has completed all major surveys for the ₹1,400-crore Integrated Urban Regeneration and Water Transport System (IURWTS) project, which aims to regenerate canals in Kochi.

The metro agency undertook the project in 2019, on the orders of the State government and awarded the work to Antea Nederland BV (Netherlands) for the development of concept, master planning, and detailed design. The six major canals in the city that will be revived under the initiative are Edappally canal, Chilavannoor canal, Thevara-Perandoor canal, Thevara canal, Market canal, and Konthuruthy canal.

“The surveys were completed within a short span of time. A detailed project report has been prepared and submitted for approval to the State government. We have lined up the course of action, including cleaning of canals, rehabilitation of people affected by the project, shore protection, and canal-oriented developments, thus bringing life back to these canals,” said Alkesh Kumar Sharma, managing director, KMRL.

“Through this project, we will bring these canals back to their erstwhile glory when they were navigable [and used to move people and cargo]. We are also looking forward to developing more lung spaces along the banks of these canals,” said Mr. Sharma, who is also the Additional Chief Secretary for Special Projects.

The metro agency completed the advanced LIDAR survey, for getting topographic details and to map sub-drains from which water enters the canals. It also completed the mandatory Social Impact Assessment (SIA), water quality studies, and Bathymetric Survey. Geotechnical bore-hole investigation at 56 identified locations, for understanding soil characteristics and lithology along the canals is nearing completion. A major portion of floodplain analysis and water-balancing studies is being done in the Netherlands and are expected to be completed by the end of this month, KMRL said in a press release.

The metro agency had submitted an application before the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and the Ministry has sanctioned the terms of reference for various mandatory clearances to be obtained, since the project area falls under the CRZ zone. The Kerala State Pollution Control Board has approved the Consent to Establish (CTE), while wildlife clearance is expected shortly from the Forest Department. The application for wetland clearance has been submitted to the Kochi Corporation.

Land identification and acquisition proposals too are progressing fast. As part of the social upliftment aspects of the project, people residing along the canal banks will be resettled in a full-fledged housing complex that will be built at Kakkanad to accommodate them.

As part of urban regeneration, KMRL has plans to implement Canal Oriented Development (COD) projects. The activities included are initial cleaning, widening, deepening to maintain the cross-section for flood mitigation and navigation, and bank protection. While striving to make the canals navigable to the possible extent, there will be inter-modal connectivity with the Kochi metro, Water Metro, and the road network. The development of water sports facilities and sports complexes too is on the anvil.

Special focus will be given to the development of sewage systems and their management. Sewage management will be addressed by laying primary sewer networks along the canals and secondary networks to individual households, KMRL informed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/survey-over-for-water-transport-system/article32824641.ece
287,2020/10/11,Excise forms special squad to stop ganja influx,"Rajahmundry in AP remains biggest source of the drug reaching Kerala

The sudden influx of ganja in huge quantities from across the border has prompted the Excise Department to form a six-member special squad in the district.

The squad under the direct supervision of the Deputy Excise Commissioner is being led by an Excise Inspector and is entrusted with intelligence gathering and field operations.

“Huge hauls of ganja were reported from across the State recently, exposing the inter-State network for smuggling from across the border, especially Andhra Pradesh. None of those big consignments reached Ernakulam, as they were seized shortly after crossing the check-posts thanks to an alert Excise force in the districts concerned. However, the fact that the potential for a lucrative trade to thrive in the district remains real in the event of some of these consignments reaching here is the reason why we formed the squad preemptively,” said T.A. Ashok Kumar, Deputy Excise Commissioner, Ernakulam.

Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh has emerged as the single biggest source of ganja flowing into the State, especially in the months post-lockdown. Mr. Kumar even suspects that the snuggling networks have been able to sell the drug to a large number of youngsters and jobless people in the wake of the economic distress spawned by the pandemic.

An Excise official with a wide ground-level intelligence network said a situation had evolved where the supply of ganja had overshot the demand, leading to piling up of the drug in Rajahmundry. “Our sources say it has reached a point where youngsters with not much money to buy large stocks and going there for small quantities like 1 to 2 kg end up being bundled with many folds more, as suppliers desperate to clear the stock are willing to take huge cuts in price,” he said. This, he claimed, was the case in which 100 kg of ganja was seized by the Excise squad in Thiruvananthapuram a few days ago.

Mr. Kumar said the huge price cut had left carriers with the potential to make a big profit, if they managed to somehow dodge enforcement and reach the consignments to the distribution networks who even otherwise made a fortune by splitting even a 1 kg consignment into numerous satchels of small quantities.

The district has a well-oiled distribution network comprising youngsters aged below 22, said the official.

Ganja seems to have recaptured its pole position among popular drugs owing to a slew of reasons from easy availability to diminished purchasing capacity of potential buyers. “Large-scale smuggling in of synthetic drugs to the district is no longer feasible, since parties and large gatherings where they were in demand are no longer taking place owing to physical distancing norms,” said Mr. Kumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/excise-forms-special-squad-to-stop-ganja-influx/article32824634.ece
288,2020/10/11,Three more arrested in Kuzhupilly murder case,"A special investigation squad of the Ernakulam Rural police arrested three more persons in connection with the alleged murder of a youngster at Munambam last month.

The arrested are Manu Naveen, 24, of Kuzhupilly, Kevin Krishna, 19, of Cherai, and Vivek, 24, of Ayyampilly. The police had earlier arrested four persons, taking the total number of arrested to seven.

The special squad was formed by District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik shortly after the incident.

Pranav, 22, of Cherai, was found beaten to death on Pallathankulangara Beach Road on September 22 around 4.30 a.m.

According to the police, tension was simmering between the victim and the accused for some time over the alleged stalking of the lover of one of the accused by the victim. The accused tailed the victim in the early hours and beat him with wooden planks on an isolated stretch near the Kuzhupilly beach.

289,2020/10/11,Third traffic police station in city may come up at Thripunithura,"It is in view of difficulty in attending to issues in the town from the Edappally station

Aimed at localised traffic management and rushing help in a prompt and efficient manner in the fast-developing eastern sides of the district, Thripunithura might get the third dedicated traffic police station in Kochi.

The whole of Thripunithura and its surroundings are currently being served by the City Traffic Police - East, based at Edappally. “Police personnel from here often find it difficult to attend to traffic hold-ups and accidents in Thripunithura and nearby areas. Their jurisdiction thus extends to around 20 km from the traffic station. Locales in the city need swift response from the police,” said G. Poonguzhali, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic, Law and Order), who is slated to join her new stint shortly as SP of Wayanad district.

“Moreover, personnel from Edappally have to manage traffic on the busy NH and other stretches in the city hub like Edappally, Palarivattom, and Kaloor. Under these circumstances, we have sent a proposal to the police headquarters, seeking bifurcation of areas under the Traffic Police - East,” she added.

While city traffic - east and west is headed by officers in the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Thripunithura might be headed by an ACP or a Circle Inspector, it is learnt.

Specialist wings

The east wing of the traffic police has, in the meantime, deputed its personnel under three wings, to make optimal use of manpower. Each wing is taking care of road engineering, traffic regulation, and rule-enforcement aspects.

Personnel of the engineering wing thus keep tab of manpower deployment, based on road and traffic conditions. They also track accident spots and suggest new infra like medians, pedestrian-crossing lines, signal systems, or modifications to existing infra like unscientifically-located U-turns. They also monitor CCTV footage, to keep tab of rule violations and to ascertain the cause of accidents.

Traffic police have also been introducing reforms, based on first-hand observation of how personnel of the Hyderabad City police function. For this, a 10-member team led by Francis Shelby, ACP of Edappally Traffic Police, spent 10 days in Hyderabad earlier this year, getting to know how innovative traffic management measures are introduced in keeping with changes in traffic pattern and density. Small changes that were introduced in traffic regulation, including on the NH Bypass, thus yielded substantial results, Ms. Poonguzhali said.

Over the past year-and-a-half, the police identified 38 bottlenecks that hindered free flow of vehicles, based on a study conducted across the city and its immediate suburbs. Steps were taken to overcome most of these hurdles, she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/third-traffic-police-station-in-city-may-come-up-at-thripunithura/article32824626.ece
290,2020/10/11,Intelligent traffic management system in city soon,"The CSML-funded initiative to be launched on October 19

A ₹26-crore Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) to streamline traffic movement and to aid in rule enforcement in Kochi will be inaugurated on October 19 by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan through videoconferencing.

The funding is from Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML), while Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation (Keltron) set up the necessary infrastructure. ITMS will also enable pedestrians to easily cross the road at a few busy areas in the city.

The key technology-based initiatives include vehicle-actuated signals, pedestrian-operated pelican signal system which will help them safely cross the road, area-traffic management in three modes, a surveillance-camera network capable of taking high-resolution images even at night and in rainy weather, a system at 35 junctions to track vehicles which jump the red signal, and a control room at the Revenue Tower to monitor and coordinate vehicle movement.

Actuated signals installed at 21 locales in Kochi will prevent the need for vehicles to wait unnecessarily at signal points. The system will automatically give preference to vehicles coming from the direction where traffic is more. The radar-based signal system will thus ensure optimal use of road space. Pelican signals have been placed on Shamugham Road, Menaka Junction, Kaloor, and Edappally.

The data thus generated will help in planning traffic management measures, if need be, with the help of agencies like NATPAC. Other key advantages include collection of traffic data like average speed, vehicle flow, and queue length, which will help in urban and traffic planning. An automated e-challan system and signages capable of displaying variable messages — from ambient air quality to police announcements for motorists — too are part of the project.

Keltron will maintain the infrastructure for a five-year period. It has already trained police personnel in managing the system.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/intelligent-traffic-management-system-in-city-soon/article32824619.ece
291,2020/10/11,Thripunithura-Poothotta road widening on the anvil,"The 15-km road to be developed as 22-metre-wide, four-lane corridor at a cost of ₹300 crore

With the Kochi metro slated to be extended to Thripunithura SN Junction by 2021 and up to the terminal station proposed near the railway station, preparatory work to widen the narrow SN Junction-Poothotta stretch is under way.

The proposed development of the 15-km road as a 22-metre-wide, four-lane corridor will end the perennial traffic hold-ups on the busy Thripunithura-Vaikom road. A sum of ₹300 crore had been allotted for the project in the 2019 Budget. The final alignment is ready, official sources said.

Thripunithura Rajanagari Union of Residents’ Associations (TRURA) has sought tangible measures to realise the long-overdue road development project and resurfacing of the entire corridor. “The government must also allot funds to complete missing links on Seaport-Airport Road and widen it,” said V.C. Jayendran, convenor, TRURA.

Narrow roads, mostly owned by the PWD, abound in the town, which was the headquarters of the erstwhile Kochi Kingdom. The government must allot funds to ensure their widening. Decades of indecision has resulted in the 8-km Thripunithura bypass project being a non-starter, said sources in PWD.

The project ran into trouble in 2019 when survey stones were reportedly laid beyond the areas that were frozen for land acquisition, following which there were instances of landowners allegedly manhandling workers engaged in the work. The Thripunithura Municipality had frozen construction activity or sale of land located within 16.5 metres from the centre of the SN Junction-Poothotta road.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/8e8oye/article32824597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11-KI-ROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/thripunithura-poothotta-road-widening-on-the-anvil/article32824598.ece
292,2020/10/11,Gehlot may call Assembly meet on farm laws,"House to discuss States’ rights to legislate, says CM

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday hinted at convening a special session of the Assembly soon to discuss the impact of farm Acts and protect the interests of farmers by examining the laws for amendments. He said the House would deliberate on the constitutional power of States to legislate on agriculture.

“We will hold a debate on the Centre’s interference in the legislative domain of States and see what rights the Assembly has. We are examining all possibilities after the Presidential assent... Every possible action will be taken to extend relief to farmers,” Mr. Gehlot said at a convention organised by the Congress against the farm laws here.

‘Black legislations’

Mr. Gehlot questioned the intent of the BJP government at the Centre behind bringing the “black legislations” during the pandemic. The bills were tabled without any discussion with the State governments and other stakeholders and passed in a “questionable manner”, he said.

He said Rajasthan had a robust network of Krishi Upaj Mandis for supporting the small and marginal farmers, which would be demolished by the new statutes. The contract farming at small land holdings and the absence of minimum support prices would destroy agriculturists and deprive all the connected people of their livelihood, he added.

A large number of representatives of farmers’ organisations, which have a launched a campaign against these Acts, attended the convention. Agriculture Minister Lal Chand Kataria, Minister of State for Technical Education Subhash Garg and Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra also addressed the gathering.

Mr. Dotasra said the farmers in the State would expose the designs of the Centre and the Congress workers would carry out a signature campaign against the farm laws.

293,2020/10/11,Surveillance project for Kunnamangalam,"Model police station to house hi-tech control room

A city surveillance project with an exclusive control room to monitor visuals from closed circuit television cameras will be implemented at Kunnamangalam along with the opening of the new Kunnamangalam model police station building. Administrative sanction has already been accorded to the ₹63.5-lakh surveillance project.

The police say the construction of the station building, which will also house the hi-tech control room, is in the final phase and they will be able to shift to the new space within six months. Only the construction of a road to the place and a few finishing works are remaining, they add.

Night surveillance cameras connected to the police control room have been one of the long-pending demands of traders in Kunnamangalam town. Recurring incidents of thefts and anti-social activities had forced many shop owners in the area to install their own surveillance systems. Some of them had also appointed security guards. According to Kunnamangalam MLA P.T.A. Rahim, the new surveillance project will help the police exercise better control over traffic management. They will be able to introduce effective night surveillance measures and track miscreants, he adds.

For the completion of the model station building, the State government will spend about ₹3 crore. On completion of the shifting process, the Kunnamangalam court building will be renovated. Administrative sanction has already been accorded to the project, which will be completed at a cost of ₹1 crore. For several decades, both the Kunnamangalam station and the court have been functioning in the same building.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/surveillance-project-for-kunnamangalam/article32829182.ece
294,2020/10/11,Wetland along Canolly Canal service road turns rubbish dump,"Corpn. turning a blind eye to issue, say residents

The wetland along the Canolly Canal service road between Eranhikkal and Kunduparamba is turning into a dumping ground of non-biodegradable and hazardous waste materials from urban households and shops. Bundles of used diapers, masks, loads of plastic bottles and disposable materials have been piling up at the spot since lockdown days.

The dense growth of shrubs and grass along the road is offering a cover for miscreants to dump waste, say residents. Though surveillance cameras were installed, they are now dysfunctional because of the lack of periodical maintenance and regular monitoring. “The lackadaisical attitude by the corporation authorities towards the place is evident as a public crematorium and a nearby multi-storey building for industrial promotion activities along the canal service road are now remaining useless. Cleaning workers never come to this abandoned spot,” said Sekharan, a casual labourer from the area.

‘Huge potential’

According to members of local residents’ associations, the Eranhikkal stretch of the Canolly Canal has huge potential to grow as an eco-tourism destination with its scenic surrounding and waterbodies. The unpolluted area was earlier home to many species of migratory birds. The Kaippurathupalam Lake nestled against the Canolly Canal was once a popular destination for hosting canoeing championships.

Though the Tourism Department authorities had plan to explore the possibility of launching pedal boat service in the area, it did not materialise. The demand to renovate the service road, which is now riddled with gaping potholes, has been pending for years. Because of the alleged lack of support from the authorities, local residents’ collective too has given up promotional activities for the area.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/wetland-along-canolly-canal-service-road-turns-rubbish-dump/article32829175.ece
295,2020/10/11,Kozhikode among districts with highest COVID tally,"1,121 people contract disease through local transmission

Kozhikode figures among the three districts that reported over 1,000 fresh COVID-19 cases in the State on Sunday as 1,219 more were found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 here.

According to the Health Department, the other two districts are Malappuram and Ernakulam.

As many as 1,121 people were infected in Kozhikode through local transmission while the source was unknown in 76 people. Within Kozhikode Corporation, there were 364 cases of locally acquired infections. There were 28 health workers among the newly infected persons. The number of active cases in the district reached 11,573, with 954 more recovering from the infection. As many as 6,929 people are under home isolation.

MP’s warning

Meanwhile, M.K. Raghavan, MP, has called for beefing up scientific containment measures in the wake of rise in COVID-19 cases in the district. In a release, he pointed out that the shortage of beds, ventilators, and ambulances was a sign of things to come. He claimed that the State might have to face a situation similar to Italy if its approach was not scientific and rationalistic. Health workers were getting tired and Kozhikode was figuring in the list of districts with a high tally of COVID cases. The highest number of restrictions too were in Kozhikode. Mr. Raghavan said that instead of ‘unscientific containment zones and lockdowns’, time-bound and scientific steps should be taken.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/pcj2j2/article32634514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvkzcovid,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kozhikode-among-districts-with-highest-covid-tally/article32827878.ece
296,2020/10/11,Lack of transparency alleged in recruitment of faculty at Calicut varsity,"Shortlists of candidates with only application numbers trigger row

Calicut University publishing the shortlist of candidates for the interview to pick faculty members for its various departments has reportedly snowballed into a controversy with allegations of nepotism and lack of transparency doing the rounds.

The university is recruiting faculty members after a gap of a decade and 116 posts are to be filled now. There had already been allegations about the notification for the appointment not specifying community-wise reservation norms. The authorities, however, had claimed that they were complying with a directive of the Kerala High Court. It was pointed out that the details would be given during the time of appointment.

The first shortlist of candidates for the recruitment of Assistant Professors to the Department of Arabic was released by the university on September 28. The list had application numbers and the candidates’ names. However, when another one for the recruitment of Assistant Professors to the departments of Russian and Comparative Literature, Philosophy, English and Hindi was out on October 7, the names of candidates were hidden. It only had the application numbers.

It has been pointed out that this smacked of lack of transparency as a large majority of candidates might have forgotten the application numbers by now. The process of recruitment had begun around a year ago. The university has reportedly not issued any order about the indexing criteria and details about the cut-off marks on the shortlist so far. The index marks of each of the applicants too had not been published. Candidates are yet to figure out if their application has been accepted or rejected as the status of their application had not been acknowledged, it is learnt.

In this context, members of the university syndicate owing allegiance to the United Democratic Front have raised the suspicion that efforts were on to recruit candidates who had been illegitimately included on the list. People related to powerful politicians in the ruling Left Democratic Front had found their names in it, they added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/644gv6/article31903653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/new-campus-sougGHV6JEJ783jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/lack-of-transparency-alleged-in-recruitment-of-faculty-at-calicut-varsity/article32827802.ece
297,2020/10/11,Plot identified for MDR-TB patients’ care centre,"19 persons undergoing treatment for the disease in Kozhikode

A one-acre plot near the Institute of Palliative Medicine on the campus of the Government Medical College, Kozhikode, has been identified for the proposed rescue and rehabilitation home for patients diagnosed with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in the district.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), those with MDR TB do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the most powerful anti-TB drugs, because the bacteria that causes TB could develop resistance to these anti-microbial drugs.

P.P. Pramod Kumar, District TB Officer, told The Hindu on Saturday that 19 persons were undergoing treatment for the disease in Kozhikode now. Dr. Pramod, who is also the officer in charge of AIDS control, said the centre would also be used for those who need in-patient treatment for AIDS. The facility for AIDS patients is coming up with the help of the Snehasparsham project of the Kozhikode District Panchayat. A project on MDR-TB patients had been submitted to the National Health Mission, Dr. Pramod said.

The WHO points out that mismanagement of treatment and person-to-person transmission are the two main reasons for the emergence and spread of MDR TB. Most people get cured by a strict six-month drug regime, along with support and supervision. “Inappropriate or incorrect use of antimicrobial drugs, or use of ineffective formulations of drugs [such as use of single drugs, poor quality medicines or bad storage conditions], and premature treatment interruption can cause drug resistance, which can then be transmitted, especially in crowded settings such as prisons and hospitals,” says the WHO.

Dr. Pramod said those under treatment include both senior citizens and youngsters. Last year, there were 33 patients, and 14 of them had completed treatment, he added. People with MDR TB could transmit the disease to hundreds, if they travel in public places. Dr. Pramod said some patients were spotted during the house survey held as part of the State government’s TB elimination mission.

Official sources said earlier that the centre would help those patients who could not earn a living by doing a job. Some were bed-ridden whose families look at them as a burden. There are others who need long-term treatment. The proposed rescue shelter could have facilities for their treatment and some occupational therapy, the source said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/plot-identified-for-mdr-tb-patients-care-centre/article32824630.ece

Local bodies in Kozhikode district have maintained hygiene and sanitation well as prescribed by the Haritha Keralam Mission (HKM). As a result, 45 of them received the ‘Hygiene Status’ from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday.

Hygiene Status is conferred on local bodies scoring at least 60% marks in sanitation, based on HKM norms.

Three municipalities and 39 grama panchayats, besides the Kozhikode Corporation, have achieved Hygiene Status in the district. Vadakara, Mukkom, and Koyilandy are the municipalities, while all grama panchayats under the Vadakara and Kunnummal blocks have achieved the feat. The grama panchayats in the Vadakara block are Eramala, Azhiyur, Onchiyam, and Chorode, while those in the Kunnummal block are Kuttiadi, Kunnummal, Maruthonkara, Kavilumpara, Velam, Kayakkodi, and Narippatta.

Besides, Ulliyeri, Naduvannur, Balussery, Kottoor, and Panangad in Balussery block; Perambra, Cheruvannur, Changaroth, and Chakkittapara in Perambra block; Madavoor, Thiruvambady, and Koodaranhi in Koduvally block; Karasseri, Chathamangalam, Kuruvattur, Mavoor, Perumanna, and Peruvayal in Kunnamangalam block; Meppayur in Meladi block; Valayam in Thooneri block; Vilyappalli and Maniyur in Thodannur block; Atholi, Arikkulam, and Chemancheri in Panthalayani block; Kakkodi in Chelannur block, and Kadalundi and Olavanna in Kozhikode block have achieved the status.

Fully functional material recovery facility, material collection facilities, source-level waste management system in every home, functional public toilets, adherence to the green protocol during public events, implementation of solid waste management rules, and plastic ban are some factors behind selection for Hygiene Status.

299,2020/10/11,Tipper lorry owners go on flash strike,"Torture alleged in the name of illegal transportation of quarry products

A section of tipper lorry owners and drivers on Saturday began a flash strike in Kozhikode district, alleging that the recent series of inspections by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) squad in the name of exposing illegal transportation of quarry products were meant to torture them.

The strike was called in the wake of the alleged suicide attempt by a driver from Mukkom who was caught for overloading on Thursday. Following the VACB report, the Geology Department had reportedly asked him to remit a fine of ₹50,000 to compound the offence. He allegedly attempted to end his life on Friday by consuming poison.

A lorry owner from Mukkom, which is known for the presence of a large number of granite quarries, said there were no accurate weighing mechanisms available in any of the large-scale quarry units. The operators concerned should be held accountable in case of overloading, as drivers cannot be held responsible for it in the absence of proper weighing and measuring facilities, he added.

The protesters also alleged that the VACB inspection did not hold any quarry operators accountable for alleged overloading. Drivers are going through acute financial crisis with containment zone regulations, and the VACB team had compounded their crisis, they claimed.

Meanwhile, expressing solidarity with tipper lorry owners and drivers, Muslim Youth League (MYL) workers from Mukkom Municipality and Karassery panchayats staged a protest, seeking legal action against the VACB squad.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/tipper-lorry-owners-go-on-flash-strike/article32824471.ece
300,2020/10/11,Test positivity rate continues to be high in Kozhikode,"District records 1,324 fresh COVID-19 cases

Test positivity rate, or the number of people being tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 per a given sample size, continues to be higher in Kozhikode, even as the district recorded 1,324 fresh COVID-19 cases on Saturday.

According to the District Medical Officer, the test positivity on Saturday was 17.36%. It is desirable to keep it at below 5%. As many as 7,626 samples were sent for lab tests in the past 24 hours. Among the newly infected persons, 1,256 people acquired it through local transmission. The source of infection of 48 people was not known. There are 30 health workers among the newly infected persons, 20 of whom are reportedly from the Kuttiadi government hospital. The functioning of the hospital has been temporarily stalled in view of this and will be restored only after two days.

At 441, Kozhikode Corporation has the highest number of people who were infected through local contacts. As many as 965 people were cured of the infection too. The number of active cases in the district now is 11,303.

Six deaths were reported from the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, on Friday and Saturday. A 23-year-old man from Valavayal in Wayanad and a 62-year-old man from Puthur in Kozhikode died on Saturday. A 63-year-old woman from Mavoor and a 78-year-old man from Thuneri in Kozhikode, and a 58-year-old man from Valiyaparamba and a 70-year-old woman from Chandappadi in Malappuram died on the previous day.

Guidelines for containment zones

Meanwhile, District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao said that if a division within the Kozhikode Corporation limits reports over 30 active COVID-19 cases, it would be declared a containment zone and restrictions would be imposed within its limits for two weeks. If the number of active cases was less than 30, the division would be declared a micro-containment zone. For municipalities and grama panchayats, any ward with 15 cases will be a containment zone. Places where below 15 cases are reported will be termed micro-containment zones.

Small and medium size business and commercial units will be allowed to function in containment zones across the district.

302,2020/10/11,"Hand-washing points, sanitiser dispensing units in Kozhikode fall into disuse","Lack of maintenance and poor patronage cited as reasons

Without proper maintenance, hand-washing points and sanitiser dispenser units set up in various places in the city to promote the government’s ‘Break the Chain’ campaign have almost disappeared. Public taps and soap dispensers that were common and fully functional during the national lockdown period have been rendered unusable.

Though a number of residents’ associations, local clubs and citizens’ forums were active in setting up water taps across the city, the practice is on the decline even within Kozhikode Corporation limits, where COVID-19 cases are on the rise. At present, usable taps and soap dispensers are not available even near bus shelters.

The efforts of some autorickshaw drivers to set up portable hand-washing units in their vehicles too have come to an end. Though such initiatives were highlighted as models in fighting COVID-19, they lost steam midway. Merchants and autorickshaw drivers in the city said people were disinclined to use public taps since hand sanitisers had gained popularity and were easy to use. Sanitiser dispensers are now available in front of all shops in the city.

Office-bearers of a youth club said they tried to set up public taps and soap dispensers during the lockdown days mainly to spread awareness about the need for personal hygiene.

The Corporation authorities, meanwhile, said they would encourage the proper maintenance and continuation of all such existing units as they would be useful for many in the absence of other sanitising options. They claimed that many non-functional public taps were recently repaired and soap dispensers were being refilled regularly.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/ze6rse/article32824430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11-KI-HANDWASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/hand-washing-points-sanitiser-dispensing-units-in-kozhikode-fall-into-disuse/article32824431.ece
303,2020/10/11,‘Perception of para sports and disability should change in India’: Manasi Joshi,"Para-athlete Manasi Joshi discusses being a part of Barbie’s Sheroes, and her hopes of influencing discourse around inclusion and diversity amongst the younger demography

Philosophy or otherwise, life is momentary in the larger scheme of things; not so much for 31-year-old para-athlete Manasi Joshi who took a momentous event that turned her world upside down, and made it her life’s biggest positive.

Until that fateful day in December 2011, Manasi was your average software engineer. “It is difficult to deal with a life turning situation when you are young. I didn’t know how to look forward from that situation,” says Manasi, of the accident that left her needing a prosthetic limb to walk.

Today, she is the world para-badminton champion in the SL3 category, having beaten fellow Indian Parul Parmar for the gold in the 2019 BWF Para-Badminton World Championships, Basel.

Blade runner

The outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent lockdown measures have inconvenienced people from all walks of life, and the impact has been doubly significant on people with disabilities. Mansi remarks that it has not been properly studied during or after lockdown.

While it afforded her more time to spend with her family, Manasi also used lockdown to get herself a blade prosthetic.

“I have been using it for a few days now, and started running with it. Most prosthetic limbs can only be used for a single task. The one I play badminton with cannot be used to run, and the one I use to walk around can only be used for that task. A blade prosthetic allows me to move freely and be quicker on my feet,” she says, adding, “For my fitness, it is important for me to be able to run. Unlike able-bodied people who take running for granted, I need to learn to run as a skill and slowly get better at it. I feel excited because it is after many years since my accident that I now have this opportunity to run.”

Role model figure

There is something else that Manasi is equally excited about. She is now a part of Barbie Sheroes; a one-of-a-kind Barbie doll in her likeness has been created by Mattel Inc., the American toy company that owns the Barbie brand.

Manasi’s inclusion in Sheroes follows the likes of filmmaker Patty Jenkins, the current women’s US Open tennis champion Naomi Osaka, and Bindi Irwin, the daughter of late Australian conservationist Steve Irwin among others, to have had dolls made to their likeness.

For Manasi, the first Indian para-athlete to be included in the list, it is “an incredible feeling”.

“I believe education around diversity and inclusion should start at a very early age, and having dolls modelled after individuals from all walks of life will help young girls look up to these role models and believe that they can be anything they want to be on and off the field,” she says, adding, “I hope this changes how people perceive para sports or disability in India.”

While the badminton champion believes India has “huge potential” to excel as a sporting nation on account of its younger demography, she notes that policies made by political leadership need to be implemented to ensure accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities.

“There are areas that require improvement, and we could do with a different approach to how we look at disability in this country... from education to job opportunities,” she adds.

At the moment, Manasi has her sights set on the upcoming Summer Paralympics in Tokyo. The sporting spectacle, along with Summer Olympics, was postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19. The Paralympics is now scheduled to begin in August 2021.

“I hope to qualify for it and win a medal,” she adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/hnv7mc/article32826549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Barbie-Sheroes-Manasi-Joshi-4-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/perception-of-para-sports-and-disability-should-change-in-india-manasi-joshi/article32826551.ece

306,2020/10/11,COVID-19 scare keeps kolu doll shoppers away form Vilachery,"This time of the year, ahead of Navarathri, the whole village used to be filled with people looking for dolls to adorn their kolu stand

A week ahead of Navarathri festival, Vilachery, a village located on the southern fringes of the city, used to be bustling as a large number of customers shop for kolu dolls here.

But, this Sunday, the whole of Vilachery wore a deserted look as there were hardly few customers there, mainly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has financially affected the artisans who make kolu dolls for a living.

This small village is home to about 200 families of artisans who have been making clay, plaster of paris and papier-mache dolls for so many decades.

P.K. Arumugam, an artisan, says till date they have sold only 30% of what they usually sell every year. “Every year, people inquire about new models of dolls that have been made for the Navaratri festival. But this year no such inquiries had been made and the footfall of shoppers has drastically reduced,” he says.

The doll makers say only a limited number of dolls were made this year as all production activities remained suspended for around four months during the initial months of lockdown. “But even this limited number of dolls remain unsold. Due to uncertainty over sale, I have stopped painting the dolls,” says A. Kalairani, another artisan.

People are still scared to come out and buy kolu dolls, says Gundha Devi, a doll seller. “Even regular customers have shied away as they say they are going to invite home only a few guests due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” she says.

The closure of educational institutions and restrictions in place at temples are also a reason for lower sales of dolls, says S. Girija, another seller. “Most of the traders, who used to buy dolls in bulk from us and sell it to the shops, have also not placed any orders this year,” she says.

The pandemic has also robbed the buying capacity of people, she says.

The poor sales has financially affected those of us who have borrowed heavily for making the dolls, says Ms. Devi. “All the artisans make a livelihood by selling dolls for Vinayaka Chathurthi, Navarathri and Christmas. The sales during Vinayaka Chathurthi was extremely poor and the sales have not picked up for Navarathri too. This will only force many artisans to look for other jobs by next year,” she says.

But not all are unhappy. P. Hari Krishnan, a seller, says sales in his shop was marginally better as he took orders through messaging platforms and sent the parcels by courier to the customers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/g77l1e/article32828638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12MACITY-KOLU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/covid-19-scare-keeps-kolu-doll-shoppers-away-form-vilachery/article32828639.ece

310,2020/10/11,Target to get 6.56 tonnes of vegetable seeds on 17.85 ha,"For the first time, the Horticulture department is providing various subsidies to motivate farmers to produce vegetable seeds.

According to a press release from the department, Madurai district has a target to cover 17.85 hectares to produce 6.56 tonnes of ‘truthful label seeds’ of various vegetables. An official said this initiative had been taken to promote entrepreneurship in seed production.

The main aim was to ensure that sufficient quantities of vegetables were produced to cater to the growing population. “To achieve this, there is a need to produce more certified vegetable seeds. But, presently farmers are dependent on private companies for seeds. Hence, this scheme was formulated by the State government to encourage more farmers to produce seeds,” the official said.

In Madurai, ‘truthful label seed’ production is promoted for cow pea, onion, drumstick, cluster bean, bitter gourd, snake gourd, pumpkin and leafy vegetables.

Farmers with irrigation facilities to cultivate vegetables can apply for the scheme. They will get a 30% subsidy for a maximum of ₹1,200 for integrated nutrient management and integrated pesticide management. A 50% subsidy will be given for construction of ‘pack house’ for up to ₹2 lakh. A 50% subsidy will be given for setting up shade nets.

“After harvest, the farmers can sell the seeds to either private companies or to the Horticulture department,” the official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/target-to-get-656-tonnes-of-vegetable-seeds-on-1785-ha/article32828192.ece

Badri Narayan.

Vellimalai in Madurai is one area where such a project can be set up, he said at a webinar on ‘Restoration of natural heritage of Madurai’ organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Young Indians, its wing, here on Saturday. Dr. Badri Narayan said that if the native trees were to be protected, they should be identified first. A board with the name of the species should be placed to show the identityof the tree. People who take care of native trees should be honoured and encouraged to continue the practice, he said.

A law on tree preservation should be enacted in Tamil Nadu on the lines of the one in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, he said.

313,2020/10/11,City police dispose of 351 petitions at camps,"Madurai City police on Sunday disposed of 351 petitions and community service register-issue complaints at special petition enquiry camps held at various places across the city.

Out of about 500 pending petitions, 351 were disposed of. “This initiiative was taken to clear backlog of petitions submitted to the Commissioner of Police and Deputy Commissioners of Police and at police stations,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) R. Shiva Prasad said.

“On working days, the officials are busy with various types of works. Besides, often when petitioners are asked to come to police station to conduct enquiry on their petitions, they find it difficult to come as they are busy with their work. Sometimes, the petition enquiry could not be conducted as the opposite party fails to turn up,” he said.

Stating that since Sunday being a holiday, all police officials - right from Inspector of Police, Sub-Inspector of Police and Special SIs - were present. The camps were conducted in marriage halls across the city so that there will be ample space for providing seating arrangements even while ensuring social distancing due to the COVID-19 threat.

Most of the petitions pertained to domestic issues, discord between neighbours and money transactions. “In those cases where the complainant and the opposite party agree for a mutual settlement, the police allow them to withdraw their petitions after giving them advice. But, if the complainant insisted on filing first information report, the police officials register the case,” Mr. Shiva Prasad.

He said this initiative would be repeated at periodical intervals to win over the confidence of the petitioners.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/x3alx3/article32828696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12MACITY-CAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/city-police-dispose-of-351-petitions-at-camps/article32827955.ece
314,2020/10/11,Thoothukudi Medical College gets state-of-the-art cancer block,"Chief Minister to inaugurate facility on October 13

Cancer patients in the district no longer have to travel long distances any more. The Government Medical College Hospital here has all facilities that will be dedicated to the people by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who is expected to arrive here on Tuesday.

The Chief Minister is visiting the district to review the COVID-19 situation and take stock of the requirements. During his stay, he will inaugurate new projects and lay foundation for development works, officials said here on Sunday.

The cancer outpatient ward at the hospital here was started in 2002. Over the years, under the National Health Mission Project, ₹16 crore was earmarked for establishing the cancer block. The State government, for its part, sanctioned ₹2.60 crore for construction of new buildings.

The works that started in 2016 ended a year later and equipment required for the cancer department was ordered and installed. Two months ago, authorities issued licence for operational purposes.

On an average, doctors say, at least 30 to 50 patients from Thoothukudi and surrounding pockets travel to other cities for treatment. With the launch of the cancer block here, the patients no longer need to travel.

Officials say eligible patients will get treatment under the Chief Minister’s Insurance Scheme too. The state-of-the-art equipment can diagnose the tumour precisely and treatment can be planned accurately. The maximum dose to the tumour will not affect normal tissues. Radiation can be effective and the normal tissues will remain intact. Radiation oncologists, medical physicist and technicians have been appointed and trained.

Minister Kadambur Raju and Collector Sandeep Nanduri, among others, inspected the new facility on Sunday and supervised the arrangements.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/xrjv70/article32827647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA12-CANCER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/thoothukudi-medical-college-gets-state-of-the-art-cancer-block/article32827648.ece

316,2020/10/11,Nagercoil Corporation not to allow digging of borewells,"Driven by the goal to prevent depletion of groundwater table, the Nagercoil Municipal Corporation has decided not to entertain requests for digging of borewells both for public and private use.

“The need for allowing borewells does not arise as the drinking water supplied by the Corporation on a daily basis is meeting the requirement. Nanjil Nadu in Kanyakumari district is blessed with water resources and sufficient ground water and it is our duty to preserve them for the future generation,” said Asha Ajith, the first IAS officer to become the Commissioner after Nagercoil became a Muncipal Corporation.

At present, the Corporation has 400 borewells for public consumption and there are innumerable borewells in private use.

Pointing out that borewells elsewhere in the state had depleted the ground water table, resulting in water scarcity, she said supply of water from Puthen Dam would fully take care of the drinking water need in the Corporation area. The scheme is expected to be complete in eight months.

N. Suresh Rajan, representing Nagercoil Assembly constituency, said he recommended a few borewells for the public use, but the Corporation had expressed its inability to entertain the request on technical grounds.

“I also agree that there is no need for digging borewells once the water from Puthen Dam will be available for the people of Nagercoil,” he said.

Asked whether the old borewells would be closed after the completion of the Puthen Dam scheme, she said a decision on the issue would be taken after studying the situation in the future.

Ms. Asha Ajith also agreed with Mr Suresh Rajan that untreated sewage entering the water bodies was a major cause of concern. According to Mr Suresh Rajan sewage from 52 wards are entering Palayar, referred to as the Pakruli river in the Sangam period, and polluting it and other water bodies receiving supply from it.

“The underground sewage system got delayed because of a few cases before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Completion of the sewage treatment plant will put an end to the problem of linking sewages directly to the water bodies,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/nagercoil-corporation-not-to-allow-digging-of-borewells/article32827527.ece
317,2020/10/11,Five persons arrested in Sullia murder case,"The Sullia Police on Sunday arrested five persons said to be involved in the October 8 murder in Sullia of Sampath Kumar (40), an accused in the murder of Kodagu district BJP secretary Balachandra Kalagi.

A special team of the district police was tipped off about the accused leaving from Munglipade near Kukke Subrahmanya in a car. The team intercepted the vehicle in Bilse Ghat and arrested the accused persons.

Two arrested persons are aged 35 and the others are aged 26, 27 and 32. Four accused persons are from Kallagundi Sampaje village, while the accused aged 32 is from Jalsoor village. The names of the accused have not been given as their test identification parade has to be held by an Executive Magistrate, the police said in a press note.

Superintendent of Police B.M. Laxmiprasad said that the arrested persons, who worked for Balachandra Kalagi, had a grudge against Sampath Kumar for the latter’s alleged involvement in Kalagi’s murder. There were also differences between supporters of Kalagi and Sampath Kumar over sand mining in which the two groups were involved.

On October 8, four persons attacked Sampath Kumar soon after he got into his car near his house in Kallagundi of Sampaje on October 8. They shot at him and attacked him with machetes. As he tried to flee, the accused chased him and shot at him once more before assaulting him with the machetes again. Sampath Kumar died on the spot, while his neighbour Thimappa, who tried to intervene, was injured.

Sampath Kumar was among the three accused arrested in connection with the murder of Balachandra Kalagi in Madikeri in March last year.

319,2020/10/11,GST Council to discuss compensation issue for third time in a row on October 12,"In its previous meeting last week, the Council had decided to extend the surcharge on taxes on luxury goods such as cars and tobacco products beyond June 2022

The GST Council in its meeting on Monday is likely to discuss the suggestion of non-BJP ruled States of setting up a ministerial panel to develop consensus on the issue of compensation, sources said.

The Council, chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising of State Finance Ministers, will for the third time in a row discuss the issue of funding the shortfall of Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue of States.

While some Opposition ruled States are demanding that a Group of Ministers be set up to arrive at a decision on the mechanism for funding compensation shortfall, BJP ruled States, which have already opted for the borrowing option given by the Centre, are of the view that they should be given a go ahead so that they can get money quickly.

In its previous meeting last week, the Council had decided to extend the surcharge on taxes on luxury goods such as cars and tobacco products beyond June 2022, but failed to reach a consensus on ways to compensate States for loss of tax revenue.

The projected total compensation shortfall in current fiscal stands at ₹2.35 lakh crore.

The Centre in August gave two options to the States to borrow either ₹97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or ₹2.35 lakh crore from market and had also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.

Following demand by some States, the amount of ₹97,000 crore was increased to ₹1.10 lakh crore.

As many as 21 States — which are BJP ruled or have supported it on various issues — have opted to borrow ₹1.10 lakh crore to meet the compensation shortfall.

The Centre has released ₹20,000 crore to the States towards compensation shortfall so far in the current fiscal.

Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% slabs.

On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/dyj4xy/article32680255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THBUGST,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/gst-council-to-discuss-compensation-issue-for-third-time-in-a-row-on-october-12/article32826388.ece

321,2020/10/11,Oldest monkey fossils outside of Africa found,"The scientists believe these monkeys were probably “jacks of all trades” able to navigate in the trees and on land, and their teeth indicated they could eat a wide variety of plants, fruits and flowers.

Scientists have found that the fossil samples unearthed in a lignite mine in China belong to a monkey species that lived about 6.4 million years ago, a discovery which indicates that they existed in Asia at the same time as apes, and are probably the ancestors of some of the modern primates in the area.

According to the researchers, including Nina G. Jablonski from the Pennsylvania State University in the US, the samples collected from a mine in southeastern Yunan Province in China are “some of the very oldest fossils of monkeys outside of Africa.”

“It is close to or actually the ancestor of many of the living monkeys of East Asia. One of the interesting things from the perspective of paleontology is that this monkey occurs at the same place and same time as ancient apes in Asia,” Jablonski noted.

The study, published in the Journal of Human Evolution, noted that the unearthed jaw and thigh bones were found in close proximity, “and are probably of the same individual.”

The scientists also uncovered a left calcaneus — heel bone — that belongs to the same species of monkey, Mesopithecus pentelicus.

“The significance of the calcaneus is that it reveals the monkey was well adapted for moving nimbly and powerfully both on the ground and in the trees,” Jablonski said. “This locomotor versatility no doubt contributed to the success of the species in dispersing across woodland corridors from Europe to Asia.”

According to the researchers, the lower jawbone and upper portion of the leg bone indicate that the individual was female.

The scientists believe these monkeys were probably “jacks of all trades” able to navigate in the trees and on land, and their teeth indicated they could eat a wide variety of plants, fruits and flowers, while apes eat mostly fruit.

“The thing that is fascinating about this monkey, that we know from molecular anthropology, is that, like other colobines (Old World monkeys), it had the ability to ferment cellulose. It had a gut similar to that of a cow,” said Jablonski.

The monkeys were successful, according to the scientists, since they could eat low-quality food high in cellulose and obtain sufficient energy by fermenting the food and using the subsequent fatty acids then available from the bacteria.

They said a similar pathway is used by animals like cows, deer, and goats.

“Monkeys and apes would have been eating fundamentally different things. Apes eat fruits, flowers, things easy to digest, while monkeys eat leaves, seeds, and even more mature leaves if they have to,” Jablonski said. “Because of this different digestion, they don’t need to drink free water, getting all their water from vegetation.”

The study noted that these monkeys are the same as those found in Greece during the same time period.

Based on the evidence obtained so far, the researchers believe these monkeys did not have to live near bodies of water, and could survive periods of dramatic climatic change.

“Suggesting they spread out from a center somewhere in central Europe and they did it fairly quickly. That is impressive when you think of how long it takes for an animal to disperse tens of thousands of kilometres through forest and woodlands.”

While there is evidence that the species began in Eastern Europe and moved out from there, Jablonski and her team noted that the exact patterns are unknown.

However, they said the dispersal of the species was rapid.

“It shows that once a highly adaptable form sets out, it is successful and can become the ancestral stock of many other species,” Jablonski said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/qzisbb/article32826412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ShuitangbaMesopithecusFig12,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/oldest-monkey-fossils-outside-of-africa-found/article32826418.ece
322,2020/10/11,Sunspots help understand life around other stars,"Studying stellar activity could also help explain the beginning of life on Earth four billion years ago.

A new study published in The Astrophysical Journal has shown how sunspots - which are relatively cooler and darker patches on the Sun - can help us understand more about conditions for life on exoplanets, planets that are outside the solar system.

As sunspots are precursors to solar flares, monitoring them can help decode how and why flares occur. On young stars, superflares happen almost daily, whereas, on more mature ones like our Sun, they may occur once in 1,000 years. A few flares may help in building RNA and DNA on planets whereas too many strong flares can damage the atmosphere, thus turning the planet uninhabitable.

High-resolution data of the Sun from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory and JAXA/NASA’s Hinode mission was used for the study.

The team studied the different layers of the Sun using 14 different wavelengths including visible, ultraviolet (UV), and X-rays.

“We wanted to know what a sunspot region would look like if we couldn’t resolve it in an image,” said Shin Toriumi, lead author on the study and scientist at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science at Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in a release. “So, we used the solar data as if it came from a distant star to have a better connection between solar physics and stellar physics.”

Putting all these data together, the team created a plot which they named light curves which showed how the light changed as the sunspot passed across the Sun’s rotating face. This also shows what a passing sunspot would look like if it were many light-years away.

“The Sun is our closest star. Using solar observing satellites, we can resolve signatures on the surface 100 miles wide,” said Vladimir Airapetian, a co-author of the study and astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “On other stars, you might only get one pixel showing the entire surface, so we wanted to create a template to decode activity on other stars.”

Studying stellar activity could also help explain the beginning of life on Earth four billion years ago. Many scientists have suggested that intense solar activity may have been a trigger.

“So far we’ve done the best-case scenarios, where there’s only one sunspot visible,” Toriumi said. “Next we are planning on doing some numerical modeling to understand what happens if we have multiple sunspots.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/9vacw7/article32826360.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/sunspots-help-understand-life-around-other-stars/article32826361.ece
323,2020/10/11,The Hindu Explains | How did the 2020 Medicine Nobel winners identify Hepatitis C infectious agent?,"Will the Nobel recognition impact the ongoing research on COVID-19?

The story so far: This year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice for their discovery of the Hepatitis C virus. The Nobel announcement said the Prize had been given to “three scientists who have made a decisive contribution to the fight against blood-borne hepatitis, a major global health problem that causes cirrhosis and liver cancer in people around the world”.

Why is the finding crucial?

Hepatitis (Greek for liver inflammation) is a disease characterised by ‘poor appetite, vomiting, fatigue and jaundice, including yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes. Chronic hepatitis leads to liver damage, which may progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer’. The Nobel release elaborately explains that “viral infection is the leading cause of hepatitis, with some forms persisting without symptoms for many years before life-threatening complications develop”.

It is said the first description of hepatitis was recorded around 400 BC by the Greek physician Hippocrates. “Infectious hepatitis may be caused by five different types of RNA or DNA viruses that are the most common cause of hepatitis worldwide,” notes the Nobel communique.

Hepatitis A spreads through contaminated food and water, and through direct contact with an infected person, including some sexual activity. Until the 1960s, exposure to blood from infected individuals was a major health hazard, with up to 30% risk of contracting chronic hepatitis following surgery or multiple blood transfusions. It was Nobel laureate Baruch Blumberg, a geneticist working at the United States’ National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, who discovered the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and made way for almost everything that followed in the hepatic virology field. This year’s laureate, Harvey Alter, worked with Blumberg in the lab during this phase. But even the identification and classification of the HBV, and the eventual elimination of HBV-contaminated blood through testing, only partially reduced the risk of getting hepatitis from blood. Clearly, the HBV was only a part of the riddle. Efforts were renewed to identify the missing pieces.

It was also imperative that efforts be channelled in this direction as the different types of viral hepatitis contribute substantially to the global burden of hepatic diseases. According to the WHO Global Hepatitis Report, 2017, “Viral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015, a number comparable to deaths caused by tuberculosis, and higher than those caused by the HIV.” However, the number of deaths due to viral hepatitis is increasing over time, while mortality caused by tuberculosis and HIV is declining.

“Most viral hepatitis deaths in 2015 were due to chronic liver disease (720,000 deaths due to cirrhosis) and primary liver cancer (470,000 deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma). Globally, in 2015, an estimated 257 million people were living with chronic HBV infection, and 71 million people with chronic HCV [Hepatitis C virus] infection … The epidemic caused by the HCV affects all regions, with major differences between and within countries. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region and the European Region have the highest-reported prevalence of HCV,” the report states.

How was the unknown factor traced?

Back at the lab, a working name was assigned to this still unknown causative factor, “non-A, non-B hepatitis” (NANBH). As the Nobel backgrounder explained, it was clear that the agent causing NANBH was responsible for an alarming number of post-transfusion hepatitis cases, and the situation was frightening, because most infected carriers showed no clinical symptoms.

The work of Dr. Alter and Dr. Houghton established a critical link between the NANBH and the HCV infection. Thereafter, the work of Charles Rice provided conclusive evidence that HCV alone could cause transfusion-mediated hepatitis, persist for a long time, and stimulate a specific antibody response — all features of the human infection.

Why is this award important?

The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet lauded the discovery of the Hepatitis C virus as a “landmark achievement in the ongoing battle against viral diseases”. The significance of choosing the work done by virologists and geneticists, at a time when others are sweating it out trying to decode the SARS-CoV-2 virus, cannot be missed. The Nobel’s recognition of pioneering work in this field is likely to be a boost to researchers whose battle with the COVID-19 virus has probably been as challenging as the decoding of the causative factors for hepatitis.

Editorial | Vanquishing viruses

Interestingly, Science, an academic journal, notes that till 2015, 106 Nobel prizes in Physiology or Medicine had been awarded to 210 laureates, and only 33 of these prizes were related to the realm of infectious diseases, clinical microbiology, and immunology.

What more needs to be done in the field?

Once the puzzle was cracked, screening methods were developed that have now dramatically reduced the risk of acquiring hepatitis from contaminated blood. Effective antiviral drugs have also become available, the Nobel acknwoledgement states.

In 2016, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) on viral hepatitis 2016–2021, calling for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. Ensuring access to affordable testing and to viral therapeutics that will improve the quality of life and reduce deaths due to hepatitis should be the priority of governments, the WHO Global Hepatitis Report advises.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ne052c/article32824001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10NOBEL,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/the-hindu-explains-how-did-the-2020-medicine-nobel-winners-identify-hepatitis-c-infectious-agent/article32824002.ece
324,2020/10/11,The Hindu Explains | How does a genome editing tool developed by two women scientists help in tackling diseases?,"How is the tool different from other editing systems? Is there a possibility of the tool being misused?

The story so far: The 2020 Nobel Prizes for sciences announced this week made history of sorts when one of it was exclusively shared by two women. Scientists Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier bagged the Nobel Prize for Chemistry “for the development of a method for genome editing”. The discovery of “one of gene technology’s sharpest tools: the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors” will lead to the emergence of novel biological applications by making it easier to edit genes, and “may make the dream of curing inherited diseases come true”.

What is CRISPR/Cas9?

Much like what Microsoft (MS) Word does for writing, the CRISPR/Cas9 system allows for adding, altering and deleting the genomic code in living beings. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) are pieces of DNA that bacteria snip off from viruses that once attacked them, much like file names used to store various documents we write in MS Word.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the importance of ‘memory cells’, which can quickly produce relevant antibodies to neutralise a repeat infection by a virus. Similarly, the CRISPR are a part of bacteria’s immunological systems that help them in recognising threatening viruses. When they sense a lurking virus, the bacteria produce customised RNA, which is necessary to translate DNA into protein, gleaned from the CRISPR libraries. This also contains Cas (CRISPR-associated) genes that are used to produce enzymes such as Cas-9. These enzymes — the Cas-9 being a particularly popular one — can be used to chop the DNA of the virus and destroy them.

How can this be used to edit genomes?

Using the tool, researchers can change the DNA of animals, plants and microorganisms with precision. Emmanuelle Charpentier, who is now director, Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, had studied Streptococcus pyogenes, a species of bacteria known to be associated with a range of illnesses such as pharyngitis, tonsillitis and scarlet fever. While studying this, she discovered a previously unknown molecule, tracrRNA. Her work showed that tracrRNA is part of bacteria’s ancient immune system, CRISPR/Cas, that disarms viruses by cleaving their DNA, the Nobel release explains. Dr. Charpentier published her discovery in 2011. The same year, she initiated a collaboration with biochemist Jennifer Doudna, now a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Together, they succeeded in recreating the bacteria’s genetic scissors in a test tube and simplifying the scissors’ molecular components so they were easier to use,” says an explainer on the Nobel Prizes website on their work. In a significant experiment, they reprogrammed the genetic scissors. “In their natural form, the scissors recognise DNA from viruses, but Charpentier and Doudna proved that they could be controlled so that they can cut any DNA molecule at a predetermined site. Where the DNA is cut it is then easy to rewrite the code of life,” the note adds.

How is the tool different from other editing systems?

Other genome editing systems like TALENs and Zinc-Finger Nucleases can do similar jobs, but several users consider the Charpentier-Doudna tool more adaptable and easier to use.

It is less than a decade since this system gained wide research and commercial interest, but in the past few years, scientists have been able to make precise single-base-pair changes or larger insertions. Coupled with the availability of genome sequences for a growing number of organisms, the technology allows researchers to find out what genes do, move mutations that are identified and associated with disease into systems where they can be studied and tested for treatment, or where they can be tested in combinations with other mutations.

Editorial | Scissoring the DNA

The commercial potential of the system is so compelling that within years of its development, there was a battle over the ownership of the intellectual property rights of the CRISPR/Cas9 involving the University of California and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Broad Institute. The essence of this was that Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute had discovered a way to deploy the system in eukaryotic cells (that make up animal cells), whereas Dr. Doudna’s patent application covered the process more generally. Dr. Zhang’s patent was granted before Dr. Doudna’s application. The patent dispute is still ongoing, and both sides claim victory in terms of the commercial application of the patents.

The prize to CRISPR/Cas9 may be unusual as it is rare for a method to be announced and conferred a Nobel within a decade of its discovery, but it underlines its game-changing potential. In the last five years, both Dr. Doudna and Dr. Charpentier have been recipients of several important prizes in sciences.

To what uses has the CRISPR/Cas9 been deployed so far?

Earlier this year, a person with hereditary blindness became the first to have a CRISPR/Cas-9-based therapy directly injected into her body. Gene-editing company CRISPR Therapeutics announced in June that two patients with beta thalassemia and one with sickle cell disease would no longer require blood transfusions after their bone marrow stem cells were edited using CRISPR techniques.

Earlier this week, according to a report in Chemistry World, Dr. Doudna launched a new company, Scribe Therapeutics, to begin work on treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Reuters reported that Dr. Doudna is already employing CRISPR in the battle against the COVID-19 as a co-founder of biotech startup Mammoth, which has tied up with GlaxoSmithKline to develop a test to detect infections.

This year, the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) in Delhi developed a COVID-19 testing kit, nicknamed ‘Feluda’, after the fictional Bengali detective, based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system. There are commercial CRISPR-based home kits that allow amateur researchers to develop their own biotechnology applications, triggering a sub-culture called ‘bio-hacking’.

Research is already underway for using proteins that are smaller and more efficient than Cas-9, though the system purportedly holds promise for treating more complex diseases, such as cancer, heart diseases, mental illnesses, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Is there a possibility of the tool being misused?

The most controversial application of CRISPR/Cas9 was in 2018, when Chinese researcher He Jiankui announced that he had used it to create ‘gene-edited twins’ Lula and Nana via in-vitro fertilisation. He used the gene scissors on the children when they were embryos to edit a gene, CCR5, that in its modified form would ostensibly protect the babies from HIV. The HIV uses the CCR5 to infect cells and the modified gene would shut the door against such an entry. He was widely condemned and sentenced to three years in jail, and stripped of his position at Shenzhen University, where he worked.

While he broke a number of medical rules, what is particularly controversial is that the specific mutations that would supposedly protect the children from HIV were not achieved. There were a host of other unintended mutations too. It is not known how these mutations are going to play out over the children's lifetimes and whether they will spread to humanity more widely in due course. Thus, even though the CRISPR/Cas-9 system allows a democratic usage in labs across the world to tinker with genomes, it still has not reached the level of precision required to be sure that it does not cause unintentional side effects.

How often have women been awarded Nobel Prizes?

This year has seen a remarkable representation of women. Four women have been named Nobel Laureates in 2020 against five men so far. The Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s national bank) Prize for economics, or the 'economics Nobel', will be announced next week. The 2001-2019 interval has seen the maximum number of women Laureates — 24 — compared to just 11 from 1981 to 2000 and 7 from 1961 to 1980. There were only 12 women Laureates from 1901 to 1960. Only one woman, Marie Curie, has been honoured twice, with the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics and the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

“Many women think that no matter what they do, their work will never be recognized the way it would be if they were a man,” Al Jazeera quoted Dr. Doudna as saying. “And I think (this prize) refutes that. It makes a strong statement that women can do science, women can do chemistry, and that great science is recognised and honoured.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/c5fwh0/article32823953.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10GERMANYNOBELPRIZE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/the-hindu-explains-how-does-a-genome-editing-tool-developed-by-two-women-scientists-help-in-tackling-diseases/article32823954.ece
325,2020/10/11,Sun Pharma recalls 747 bottles of generic diabetes drug in U.S. market,"It is suspected to contain a cancer-causing component.

Leading drug maker Sun Pharma is recalling 747 bottles of generic diabetes drug in the U.S. due to possibility of the affected lot containing cancer causing nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) above the acceptable intake limit, the U.S. health regulator has said.

As per the latest Enforcement Report of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is recalling the bottles of RIOMET ER (metformin hydrochloride for extended-release oral suspension) in the American market.

As per the USFDA, the company is recalling the product due to deviation from the current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) — detection of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) impurity in finished drug product.

The product has been manufactured at Sun Pharma’s Mohali-based manufacturing plant and is being recalled by its U.S.-based subsidiary.

The company initiated the recall on September 23, the USFDA said.

The U.S. health regulator has classified it as a Class-II recall, which is initiated in a “situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.”

Metformin Hydrochloride extended-release suspension is a prescription oral medication indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood glucose control in adults with type-2 diabetes mellitus.

Various companies across the globe have announced similar recalls for the product after the USFDA pointed out presence of NDMA above permissible limits.

In July this year, Lupin and Granules India had also recalled close to 9.71 lakh bottles of generic diabetes drug in the U.S. for the similar reason.

FDA’s testing has shown elevated levels of NDMA in some extended release (ER) metformin formulation, but not in the immediate release (IR) formulation or in the active pharmaceutical ingredient.

NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen based on results from laboratory tests. It is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and food, including meats, dairy products and vegetables.

In a separate note, the USFDA said Strides Pharma Inc, a unit of Bengaluru-based Strides Pharma Science Ltd, is recalling 11,280 bottles of Potassium Chloride extended-release rablets due to “failed dissolution specifications“.

The Class II recall was initiated by the company on August 24.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/1wayfs/article32267782.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THSUNPHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sun-pharma-recalls-many-bottles-of-generic-diabetes-drug-in-us-market/article32826102.ece
326,2020/10/11,Freight-rate surge stirs call for shipping regulator,"Several trade bodies have urged the Centre to set up a regulator to deal with the rising freight charges, amid the problem of container shortages that exporters are facing.

Engineering Export Promotion Council of India claimed that shipping lines are demanding high freight charges as inward traffic from different countries, particularly from China, has declined for which the exporters are required to pay a higher amount for outbound consignments.

“Imports from China have fallen and the liners have increased freight rates. No shipping company likes to sail empty after delivery of export consignments,” Sanjay Budhia, chairman of CII national committee on exports and imports, told PTI.

He said all the exporters across the country are facing this problem.

“This is leading to a situation where cargo is lying at ports. We urged the government to set up a shipping regulator to control the freight rates,” Mr. Budhia said, adding exports have started to pick up despite the coronavirus crisis.

After contracting for six months in a row, exports grew by 5.27% to $27.4 billion in September.

The shipping companies have raised freight rates due to falling imports from China as liners do not have much cargo while they are returning, an official of the engineering exporters’ body said. “This is making Indian exports uncompetitive in the global markets,” an EEPC official said.

After witnessing a sharp fall, engineering exports have somewhat steadied, though the contraction continues, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/itfxqc/article29443093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17CONTAINERLORRIES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/freight-rate-surge-stirs-call-for-shipping-regulator/article32823620.ece

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

Patience is key in any endeavour. Sure, take a second to laugh at how lame and elderly that sounds.

Here’s the thing, though. Most likely, you had NO IDEA what the clue meant at first glance. See, A clue isn’t like an Instagram post, where you can tell immediately whether Sharon is flexing or BEING awesome.

To understand a cryptic clue, you’ve got to spend some time with it and understand it better. Try it. It’s actually WAY MORE FUN than scrolling and scrolling and scrolling till you find some post that you want to press ‘like’ on. And in the end, the feeling of success will make you feel so good!

The Hindu Cryptic #13064 | Dr. X| 13 Across CLUE: Old boy babbles about nursing a little silly infatuation (9) Clue types : Abbreviation, reversal, containment Definition : infatuation Answer : OBSESSION Clue explained: We need a 9-letter word here that means ‘infatuation’. And here’s how you could solve it. ‘Old’ and ‘boy’ are outright candidates for abbreviations. O is a shortened way to say ‘old’. And B is a common way to abbreviate the word ‘boy’. In fact, ‘old boy’ is a conventional way that male alumni of British universities are referred to, often abbreviated as OB. Another word for ‘babble’ is NOISE. So, ‘babbles’ would be NOISES. So, from ‘babbles about’ we should infer a reversal of NOISES; i.e. SESION. SESION will be ‘nursing’ or containing within itself ‘a little silly’. Now, ‘a little silly’ is just another way of saying we need just a little bit of the word ‘silly’, which is S. So, if OB and SESION contain S, the newly birthed word for ‘infatuation’ is OBSESSION! (Though the word may be newly birthed here, the idea of infatuation itself is as old as Romeo and Juliet’s ancient ancestors. So don’t mock elders when they are being hella obsessive about all the really old things they love. They’re just being themselves. You will too most likely. So be nice to your future self, OB and OG).
