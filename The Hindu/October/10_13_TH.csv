1,2020/10/13,"SAI, NRAI make elaborate arrangements for camp","Foreign coaches Smirnov, Mikhailov will join in due course

The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) and the Sports Authority of India (SAI) have made elaborate arrangements for the safety of the core group of shooters for the training camp, scheduled at the Dr. Karni Singh Range from October 15 to December 17.

As per the plan, the shooters are scheduled to assemble at the hotel on Oct. 15 and there will be a COVID-19 test the next day.

The shooters, coaches and support staff will stay in quarantine at the hotel for a week and undergo the test once again before moving to the range for training.

Adherence to SOP

NRAI and SAI will share the responsibility of ensuring the strict adherence to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).

“The responsibility for maintaining the shooting range lies with the Administrator of the range. To maintain safety, zoning of premises by nature of risk category to minimise the contact between campers and range personnel has been planned into green, orange, yellow and red zones,” SAI said in a media release.

It was also further stressed that NRAI would make arrangements for stay for all the campers and SAI would provide support “as per existing norms”.

The responsibility of the campers at the range will be with SAI, while NRAI will be responsible when they are out of the range.

Alternate option

For the campers in the Delhi NCR, there is an option to self-isolate at home for quarantine.

However, it is understood that the coaches prefer their shooters to stay in the hotel even during the quarantine period.

Rifle coach Deepali Deshpande said there would be a healthy routine during the quarantine week, with zoom sessions, so that the shooters are ready for training.

“Steps are in place for the shooters to perform in a safe and comfortable environment,” NRAI secretary Rajiv Bhatia said in the statement.

Foreign coaches Pavel Smirnov and Oleg Mikhailov would also be joining the camp in due course.

Meanwhile, there was doubt about the availability of some of the shooters selected for the core group training, owing to college examinations other commitments and concerns.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/sai-nrai-make-elaborate-arrangements-for-camp/article32847564.ece
2,2020/10/13,LeBron James has reinforced his credentials as the greatest of this generation,"The Los Angeles Lakers point forward’s pin-point passing and playmaking reached a peak this season as he won a fourth NBA title with a third team

After winning his fourth ring in his tenth attempt in the NBA finals, Los Angeles Lakers’ LeBron James has begged the question — is he finally in the conversation with Michael Jordan for the title “Greatest of All Time”?

The soon-to-be 36-year-old point forward was dominant in the 2020 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, averaging 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, 8.5 assists, 1.2 steals.

His physicality — a key attribute that has allowed him to dominate the league since making his debut in 2003 — has remained undiminished, allowing him to muscle his way to the rim, taking knocks and multiple defenders on him. His defining skill — pin-point passing and playmaking reached a peak this season as he averaged a career-high 10.2 assists per game in the regular season (8.8 in the playoffs).

Elevated defence

In the past, James would focus on the defensive end mostly on pivotal possessions, but this season, under the tutelage of the defensive-minded coach Frank Vogel, he elevated his play on that end. Fivethiryyeight.com’s advanced metric, RAPTOR (based on both per minute and box-score statistics), rated James among the top 10 defenders in the 2020 playoffs and second only to teammate Anthony Davis.

All said, it was a dominant performance by James, well aided by his superstar teammate Davis, and some robust contributions from other key role players that led the Lakers to a 16-5 run en route to their record 17th championship (jointly held with the Boston Celtics).

In elite company

Only three other players have made it to 10 or more NBA Finals — Celtics great Bill Russell (who won in 11 of the 12 finals in 13 remarkable seasons), Russell’s teammate Sam Jones (11 Finals, 10 rings), and former Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (10 Finals, six rings — including one with the Milwaukee Bucks).

The Celtics were a dominant team in the 1960s in an era where there were only 10 NBA teams and Russell willed them to 11 titles through his overwhelming defensive presence.

James, with his versatility and achievements during a much more skilled and competitive era of basketball, can be considered as having surpassed Russell and Abdul-Jabbar in terms of individual accolades that takes into account team success.

His closest comparison in terms of skill, Magic Johnson, had an equally dominant career — five titles, nine Finals, three-time Finals and NBA MVP titles — and a similar role on offence as a point forward like James. But James has been a much more dominant scorer, third overall in total points scored in the regular season and second overall (behind Abdul-Jabbar) in total points in regular season and playoffs combined.

Comparison with Jordan

The only hurdle that James seemingly stares ahead is arguably Michael Jordan’s career performance — six wins in six Finals with MVPs in all of them, two “three-peats”, five MVPs, and one-time defensive player of the year title.

Jordan was ruthless after reaching his peak in terms of skills and performance, winning his titles by his peerless scoring powers and strong perimeter defence.

Jordan’s relentlessness and the Chicago Bulls’ dominance of the 1990s — he never lost an NBA final and the Bulls never had a Finals series that went to seven games — set him apart from other NBA superstars and his popularity and competitiveness made the NBA what it is today.

James has already played more years than Jordan and still has a lot left in this tank. And he won his four titles with three different teams — Miami Heat (that was constructed with three all-NBA team stars), hometown Cleveland Cavaliers and now the LA Lakers.

Chequered run

Unlike Jordan, who endured pain and defeat in his initial years with the Bulls, and then went to lead an indomitable machine, James reached the NBA finals much early in his Cavaliers stint, moved on to a more competitive Heat squad that won two titles, before reaching a pinnacle by returning to the Cavaliers and willing a less-talented squad to overcome the NBA regular season-winning, record-breaking Golden State Warriors in 2016.

He lost three of the four Cavaliers-Warriors finals but the Durant-Curry-Green-Thompson-Iguodala-led Warriors team was much superior in talent than the James-led teams.

James’ Heat also lost to a well-oiled San Antonio Spurs team in 2014, which paved the way for James’ return to the Cavaliers but his most painful NBA Finals loss was to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011 as a Heat player and which featured his poorest performance (by his standards) in the Finals.

Yet, James’ longevity, ability to mould his strengths to multiple squads and playing under multiple coaches, constant improvement on offence and defence even while playing to his other-worldly strengths and the sheer statistical volume of production on the court, should, finally place him on the same pedestal as Jordan, albeit of this generation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/bo0acd/article32846511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14NBA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/lebron-james-has-reinforced-his-credentials-as-the-greatest-of-this-generation/article32846512.ece
3,2020/10/13,No national competitions unless all States allow reopening of pools: Swimming Federation of India,"Last month, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had announced the reopening of pools used for training of sports persons across the country from October 15.

Swimming Federation of India (SFI) on Tuesday ruled out the possibility of conducting any competition in the country unless the pools are reopened for training in all the States following the coronavirus-induced break.

Last month, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had announced the reopening of pools used for training of sports persons across the country from October 15.

The restriction on swimming pools were in place since March 24 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“On October 15, not all swimming pools will open, may be one or two. Pools are maintained by clubs, State governments etc. So it would not be possible to conduct national competitions if all States do not allow reopening of pools,” Virendra Nanavati, SFI Executive Director, said during a virtual press conference.

“So we have to wait for 4-5 months and see if it is possible to have competitions,” he added.

The governing body also said that strict action will be taken against swimmers, who violate the SOPs laid down by the sports ministry to ensure a safe return for the sport following the coronavirus-induced break.

“The swimming pools will open with strict SOPs in place and we cannot deviate from the SOPs by even 1 %. Already our swimmers have been affected by the six months break due to COVID-19,” said RN Jayaprakash, President, SFI.

“So we can’t take the SOPs for granted. We can’t falter in any way. We will speak to State units to implement the SOPs strictly. We will recommend strict action who deviates from the SOPs.”

The SFI also announced its partnership with Australian Sports Education and Consultancy Company, MoreGold led by Wayne Goldsmith for Coach Education and Certification.

“The talent in India is unquestioable and I don’t see any reason why we can’t have great swimmers like you have great cricketers such as Gavaskar and Tendulkar in this country,” said Goldsmith, Managing Director, Moregold Sports.

“Research and development will be the first phase, where we listen to coaches to know their technique and strength to understand their speciific needs. We would design specific courses for coaches to create swimmers.

“My ambition is to find that unique quality to train coaches to produce outstanding performances. What we create will be unique and effective in India.”

The partnership is part of the long-term strategic road map launched by SFI, aiming to create success stories at the 2022 Asian Games, Commonwealth Games leading up to the 2024 & 2028 Olympic Games.

“We need to address early burn outs, injuries and attrition in the sport. We need to focus on these attributes from the start if we have to win medals,” said Monal Chokshi, Secretary General, SFI after launching “Development strategy for competitive swimming in India Mission 2028”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ls7n1z/article32843437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POOLKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/no-national-competitions-unless-all-states-allow-reopening-of-pools-swimming-federation-of-india/article32843438.ece
4,2020/10/13,Denmark Open badminton | Lakshya Sen enters second round,"Denmark Open Super 750 event is the only event happening this year with BWF forced to cancel multiple events.

Fast-rising Indian shuttler Lakshya Sen made a successful return to competitive badminton, beating Christo Popov in straight games in the opening round of the $750,000 Denmark Open, which marked the resumption of the international calender after a coronavirus-forced break of seven months.

The 19-year-old Indian, who claimed five titles including two Super 100 tournaments last year, produced a clinical performance to outwit Popov 21-9 21-15 to reach the second round.

He will take on the winner of the match between Denmark’s Hans-Kristian Solberg Vittinghus and Belgium’s Maxime Moreels.

“I moved quite well, that was the key. In the second game he had a lead but I had made a few mistakes. I was able to cut down on them and find my rhythm,” Lakshya, who is currently ranked world no.27, was quoted as saying by Badminton World Federation (BWF).

“I’m very happy to be playing again after seven months and it felt very normal on the court.”

Lakshya looked in good touch as he moved well on the court and found his touch from the word go.

The Indian jumped to a 11-8 lead at the break in the opening game and didn’t allow his opponent to make a comeback, reeling off three points to move to 14-8.

He then pocketed the remaining seven points on the trot as Popov could only watch helplessly.

The second game was a more competitive affair as both the players fought tooth and nail, moving neck-and-neck till 12-12.

After that, Lakshya once again broke off and moved to 15-12 and 16-14 before closing the match comfortably.

Jeff Bezos’ aerospace company, Blue Origin, has announced the launch of its 13th New Shepard mission which will set a reusability record for its New Shepard rocket as it tests key NASA technologies.

This mission will be a record 7th consecutive flight for this particular vehicle, and is slated to launch on October 13 at 1:35 PM UTC (7:05 PM IST) after being postponed twice last month due to technical issues. It will carry a total of 12 payloads to space and back, Blue Origin noted in a statement.

The latest mission will demonstrate NASA’s Deorbit, Descent, and Landing Sensor including testing the precision landing technologies that have been designed for future missions to the Moon including the Artemis program.

“This is the first payload to fly mounted on the exterior of a New Shepard booster rather than inside the capsule, opening the door to a wide range of future high-altitude sensing, sampling, and exposure payloads,” the aerospace company said.

The tests will determine how the sensors, computers, and algorithms are functioning to help a spacecraft land on the Moon. They are expected to provide a spacecraft’s location and speed as it moves towards the lunar surface to help it land autonomously within 100 meters of a chosen point.

7,2020/10/13,SpaceX launches its 13th Starlink mission. What does the company plan to achieve?,"Aboard the Falcon 9 rocket, the latest Starlink mission carried 60 satellites that will join over 700 already in the orbit. The Starlink satellites were deployed about an hour after lift-off.

Last week, Elon Musk-founded aerospace company, SpaceX, successfully launched its 13th Starlink mission after aborting the mission four times due to bad weather. Aboard the Falcon 9 rocket, the latest Starlink mission carried 60 satellites that will join over 700 already in the orbit. The Starlink satellites were deployed about an hour after lift-off, SpaceX said.

What is Starlink?

Starlink is a network of satellites that provide internet. Each satellite is compactly designed, weighs about 260kg, and is equipped with four-phased array antennas, single solar array, ion propulsion system, navigation sensors, and debris tracking system.

The satellite network operates at 550km above the Earth’s surface in low Earth orbit (LEO), unlike conventional internet satellites that are positioned much higher, at over 35,000km.

SpaceX’s first Starlink mission was launched on May 24, 2019, which carried 60 satellites. The company has approval to launch 12,000 Starlink satellites, and it has requested the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to approve launch of another 30,000 satellites.

How does it work?

When an internet signal is sent from the Earth, one of the Starlink satellites receives it and then communicates with other satellites in the network. Once signal reaches the most ideally located satellite, it is relayed to a ground receiver.

Starlink satellites communicate with each other using laser light, and at any given time, a Starlink satellite is connected to four other satellites in the mega-constellation.

The phased array antennas allow satellites to transfer huge amount of data in a short period of time. The in-built navigation sensors provide altitude information to the satellites for precision internet data transfer.

As the Starlink satellites orbit in LEO, they are much closer to the ground receivers, which significantly reduces latency during data transfer process.

On the down-side, more number of satellites are required to have an extensive coverage, as they are positioned much closer to Earth, and can only cover a limited area.

The ion thrusters, help the satellites move to orbit, manoeuvre in space, and de-orbit at the end of their life. And the inputs from the debris tracking system helps them perform manoeuvres to avoid collisions with space debris and other spacecraft.

How will it be useful?

The network of LEO satellites will deliver high speed, low latency internet in remote areas where connectivity is limited or completely unavailable, including on aeroplanes and ships.

So, people living in areas where traditional internet is inaccessible, will be able to benefit the most from Starlink internet service, depending on its availability.

After the latest mission’s launch, Musk tweeted, “Once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US & hopefully southern Canada. Other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval.”

SpaceX Engineer, Kate Tice had earlier confirmed that Starlink internet private beta testing speeds are over 100 Mbps.

Companies like Amazon, Telesat, and OneWeb are also considering to operate LEO-based internet service. Amazon’s Project Kuiper has been approved by the FCC, with a constellation of 3,236 satellites in the LEO.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/qiwi8s/article32844120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SpaceX-Starlink,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/spacex-launches-its-13th-starlink-mission-what-does-the-company-plan-to-achieve/article32844230.ece

Google’s parent Alphabet and Soft Bank successfully tested the world’s first LTE internet connectivity from a solar-powered unmanned aircraft flying above 62,000 feet.

""This technology holds great promise for the future of connectivity, especially as part of efforts to expand internet access to places that don’t yet have it,"" said Vint Cerf, VP and Chief Internet Evangelist, Google.

SoftBank's HAPSMobile and Alphabet’s Loon LLC jointly conducted the test on High Altitude Platform Station’s (HAPS) autonomous aircraft.

It enabled LTE connectivity for about 15 hours during the test flight, despite demanding conditions in the stratosphere, where wind speed crossed 30 meters per second and temperature was as low as negative 73 degree Celsius.

Smooth operations and connection speeds during the test flight enabled high-definition low-latency video calls. Participants in the video call were in New Mexico, Tokyo, Mountain View, California and Washington, DC. The calls were successful both indoors and outdoors.

The teams could participate in the video call using regular smartphones, as the radio waves transmitted and received by the aircraft operated on the same frequencies as existing smartphones.

The test provided insight into how HAPS could be used in disaster management and lifesaving technologies.

“HAPS technology is greatly needed by all of us for natural disaster recovery and Internet inclusion,"" said Jun Murai, HAPSMobile External Director.

The companies also plan to use the data collected during the test flight in their working with the regulators and telcos to complete the work on HAPS.

A surge in the number of fake websites that use Amazon's brand and logo may make millions of shoppers prone to phishing attacks and data theft, online fraud detection firm Bolster said in a statement.

This comes ahead of Amazon's highly anticipated Prime Day that is said to attract more than 150 million Prime members. In 2019, Amazon had sold more than 175 million items.

This year, the online retailer is offering more than a million deals for a period of 48 hours, starting October 13 in 19 countries including the U.S., UK, China, Germany and Singapore.

The number of malicious domains containing the words 'Amazon' and 'Prime' doubled in the past month, compared to the previous month, according to Check Point, another security research firm. These domains are easy ways for hackers to lure customers into keying-in their most sensitive data, such as credit card information, names, birthday, email and physical addresses, and other details, into the hacker’s malicious site.

One campaign targets 'returns' or 'order cancellations' related to Prime Day. The URL 'www.amazoncustomersupport[.]net' is designed to mimic an authentic Amazon site, and the webpage could easily fool an unsuspecting shopper.

Signs of a fraudulent website include availability of a customer support number, when in reality Amazon encourages the use of support through its website. Other signs include debit and credit card information requests for refund and log-ins without passwords.

They win by default and are required to enter credit card information for a $1 to receive the iPhone 11 Pro.

The site claims the phone will be delivered by courier in 5-7 days. The $999 phone will never arrive, and the shopper begin to see strange charges on the credit card number provided, the statement said.

11,2020/10/13,Walt Disney restructures entertainment businesses to boost streaming,"The move came days after activist investor Daniel Loeb of hedge fund Third Point urged Disney to forgo a dividend payment and double its programming investment in streaming.

Walt Disney Co said on Monday it had restructured its media and entertainment businesses to accelerate growth of Disney+ and other streaming services as consumers increasingly gravitate to digital viewing.

Under the reorganization, Disney will separate the development and production of programming from distribution to be more responsive to consumer demands.

The move came days after activist investor Daniel Loeb of hedge fund Third Point urged Disney to forgo a dividend payment and double its programming investment in streaming.

Disney shares rose nearly 5% in after-hours trading to $130.76.

The media and theme parks company launched the Disney+ streaming service in November 2019. It has exceeded its own targets by drawing more than 100 million streaming customers worldwide to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.

Streaming pioneer Netflix Inc boasts 193 million, but has built that customer base over the 13 years.

Loeb had argued that Disney needed to cut its dividend to increase spending on new TV shows and movies to sign up new customers more quickly.

Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek, in an interview with CNBC, said the company is planning to increase investments in content but he did not say if it was prepared to cut its dividend to finance the strategy.

“Managing content creation distinct from distribution will allow us to be more effective and nimble in making the content consumers want most, delivered in the way they prefer to consume it,” Chapek, who took the company's top job in February, said in a separate statement.

In a statement on Monday, Loeb welcomed Disney's revamp of its media and entertainment structure.

“We are pleased to see that Disney is focused on the same opportunity that makes us such enthusiastic shareholders: investing heavily in the (direct-to-consumer) business, positioning Disney to thrive in the next era of entertainment,” Loeb said.

Under the changes, Disney's studios, general entertainment and sports business would come under one division while distribution and commercialization would fall under a separate global unit.

Disney said its creative teams would develop and produce programming for streaming and traditional platforms, and the distribution group would decide where customers would see it.

Chapek told CNBC there would be layoffs as a result of ”centralization” of functions but did not say how many.

Kareem Daniel, formerly president of consumer products, games and publishing, will oversee Disney's new media and entertainment distribution group, the company said.

Alan Horn and Alan Bergman will continue to head Disney's studio operations, which will manage programming from big franchises including Marvel, Star Wars, Disney animation and Pixar. Peter Rice will run general entertainment programming and Jimmy Pitaro will oversee sports.

AT&T, which debuted the HBO Max streaming service in May, reorganized in August to combine its film and TV operations under one studio head to better compete in the streaming media wars.

Disney said it would hold an investor day on Dec. 10 to provide more information about its strategy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/5pkrk9/article32841752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WaltDisneyrestructuring,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/walt-disney-restructures-entertainment-businesses-to-boost-streaming/article32841612.ece

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Facebook Inc said on Monday it was updating its hate speech policy to ban any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust.

The move comes two years after Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a 2018 interview with tech website Recode said that while he found Holocaust denial deeply offensive, he did not think Facebook should delete such content.

“I've struggled with the tension between standing for free expression and the harm caused by minimizing or denying the horror of the Holocaust,” said Zuckerberg, who is Jewish, in a Facebook post on Monday.

“My own thinking has evolved as I've seen data showing an increase in anti-Semitic violence, as have our wider policies on hate speech,” he said.

The social media company said that, starting later this year, it would also direct people searching for terms associated with the Holocaust or its denial to credible information off Facebook.

The World Jewish Congress and the American Jewish Committee praised the move.

“For several years, the World Jewish Congress has advocated for Facebook to remove Holocaust denial content from its platform,” that group said in a statement.

This summer, civil rights groups organized a widespread Facebook advertising boycott to try to pressure social media companies to act against hate speech on their platforms.

“This has been years in the making. Having personally engaged with @Facebook on the issue, I can attest the ban on Holocaust Denial is a big deal,” tweeted Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, one of the boycott's organizers. “Glad it finally happened,” he added.

The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany has also pushed for Facebook to ban Holocaust denial content and has called for Zuckerberg to meet with survivors through its #NoDenyingIt social media campaign.

In August, Facebook banned certain anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and stereotypes.

In its blog post, the company cited a recent survey that found almost a quarter of adults in the U.S. aged 18-39 said they believed the Holocaust was a myth, that it had been exaggerated or they were not sure.

The company said that enforcement of its new policies would not “happen overnight.”

“There is a range of content that can violate these policies, and it will take some time to train our reviewers and systems on enforcement,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/rlyeg7/article32841357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/fb-reutersjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-to-ban-content-that-denies-or-distorts-the-holocaust/article32841342.ece
13,2020/10/13,Global watchdogs agree rules for stablecoins like Facebook's Libra,"Regulators for bank capital and anti-money laundering will report by December 2021 on whether rule changes are needed.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Central banks set out to regulate cross-border stablecoins like Facebook's planned Libra with a common approach on Tuesday, saying more rules may later be needed to ensure stability.

The prospect of a currency-backed stablecoin being used by billions of people on Facebook has galvanised central banks into putting together rules and into considering how they could launch their own digital currency.

Existing national rules do not fully cover stablecoins the Financial Stability Board (FSB) said in a statement, adding that regulators should ensure that global stablecoins are fully accountable, keep data safely, have effective safeguards against cyber attacks and money laundering.

The FSB said it will take “appropriate actions” to ensure implementation of the guidance to avoid regulatory gaps that could undermine financial stability, by adhering to all applicable regulatory standards, addressing risks to financial stability before commencing operation, and adapting to new regulatory requirements as necessary.

The FSB, which groups central banks and financial regulators from the Group of 20 Economies (G20) and put a draft version of its recommendations to public consultation in April, said stablecoins could bring efficiencies to cross-border retail payments, which tend to be slow and expensive.

“A widely adopted stablecoin with a potential reach and use across multiple jurisdictions could become systemically important,” the FSB said in a report to G20 finance ministers.

“Authorities agree on the need to apply supervisory and oversight capabilities and practices under the 'same business, same risk, same rules' principle,” it said.

Regulators for bank capital and anti-money laundering will report by December 2021 on whether rule changes are needed. A review of how stablecoins are being regulated will be completed by July 2023, the FSB added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/dnb2dk/article32841210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/libra-reutersjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/global-watchdogs-agree-rules-for-stablecoins-like-facebooks-libra/article32841198.ece
14,2020/10/13,Microsoft attempts takedown of global criminal botnet,"Microsoft argued that the crime network is abusing its trademark

Microsoft announced legal action on October 12 seeking to disrupt a major cybercrime digital network that uses more than 1 million zombie computers to loot bank accounts and spread ransomware, which experts consider a major threat to the U.S. presidential election.

The operation to knock offline command-and-control servers for a global botnet that uses an infrastructure known as Trickbot to infect computers with malware was initiated with an order that Microsoft obtained in Virginia federal court on Oct. 6. Microsoft argued that the crime network is abusing its trademark.

“It is very hard to tell how effective it will be but we are confident it will have a very long-lasting effect,” said Jean-Ian Boutin, head of threat research at ESET, one of several cybersecurity firms that partnered with Microsoft to map the command-and-control servers. “We’re sure that they are going to notice and it will be hard for them to get back to the state that the botnet was in.”

Cybersecurity experts said that Microsoft’s use of a U.S. court order to persuade internet providers to take down the botnet servers is laudable. But they add that it’s not apt to be successful because too many won’t comply and because Trickbot’s operators have a decentralized fall-back system and employ encrypted routing.

Paul Vixie of Farsight Security said via email “experience tells me it won’t scale - there are too many IP’s behind uncooperative national borders.” And the cybersecurity firm Intel 471 reported no significant hit on Trickbot operations Monday and predicted “little medium- to long-term impact” in a report shared with.

But ransomware expert Brett Callow of the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft said that a temporary Trickbot disruption could, at least during the election, limit attacks and prevent the activation of ransomware on systems already infected.

The announcement follows a Washington Post report on Friday of a major — but ultimately unsuccessful — effort by the U.S. military’s Cyber Command to dismantle Trickbot beginning last month with direct attacks rather than asking providers to deny hosting to domains used by command-and-control servers.

A U.S. policy called “persistent engagement” authorizes U.S. cyberwarriors to engage hostile hackers in cyberspace and disrupt their operations with code, something Cybercom did against Russian misinformation jockeys during U.S. midterm elections in 2018.

Created in 2016 and used by a loose consortium of Russian-speaking cybercriminals, Trickbot is a digital superstructure for sowing malware in the computers of unwitting individuals and websites. In recent months, its operators have been increasingly renting it out to other criminals who have used it to sow ransomware, which encrypts data on target networks, crippling them until the victims pay up.

One of the biggest reported victims of a ransomware variety sowed by Trickbot called Ryuk was the hospital chain Universal Health Services, which said all 250 of its U.S. facilities were hobbled in an attack last month that forced doctors and nurses to resort to paper and pencil.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials list ransomware as a major threat to the Nov. 3 presidential election. They fear an attack could freeze up state or local voter registration systems, disrupting voting, or knock out result-reporting websites.

While cybersecurity experts say the operators of Trickbot and affiliated digital crime syndicates are Russian speakers mostly based in eastern Europe, they caution that they are motivated by profit, not politics. They do, however, operate with impunity with no interference from the Kremlin as long as their targets are abroad.

Trickbot is a particularly robust internet nuisance. Called “malware-as-a-service,” its modular architecture lets it be used as a delivery mechanism for a wide array of criminal activity. It began mostly as a so-called banking Trojan that attempts to steal credentials from online bank account so criminals can fraudulently transfer cash.

But recently, researchers have noted a rise in Trickbot’s use in ransomware attacks targeting everything from municipal and state governments to school districts and hospitals. Ryuk and another type of ransomware called Conti — also distributed via Trickbot — dominated attacks on the U.S. public sector in September, said Callow of Emsisoft.

Alex Holden, founder of Milwaukee-based Hold Security, tracks Trickbot’s operators closely and said the reported Cybercom disruption — involving efforts to confuse its configuration through code injections - succeeded in temporarily breaking down communications between command-and-control servers and most of the bots.

“But that’s hardly a decisive victory,” he said, adding that the botnet rebounded with new victims and ransomware.

The disruption — in two waves that began Sept. 22 — was first reported by cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs.

The AP could not immediately confirm the reported Cybercom involvement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/6mld2p/article32721292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19NETMICROSOFT,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microsoft-attempts-takedown-of-global-criminal-botnet/article32839552.ece

18,2020/10/13,Taiwan dismisses latest China spying accusations,"Taiwan on Tuesday dismissed new spying allegations by China as a further attempt to smear the government of the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its own territory.

The remarks follow a report Monday night by Chinese broadcaster CCTV featuring a taped confession from a man identified as Cheng Yu-chin, the second such report in as many days.

On Sunday, CCTV broadcast a confession by a man identified as Li Mengju, whose name is also spelled Lee Meng-chu, who like Cheng said he had been working to destabilize China and harm the ruling Communist Party’s reputation.

In the same report, CCTV said security personnel had solved more than 100 spying cases as part of an initiative dubbed Operation Thunder 2020.

Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang called the accusations an attempt by Beijing to “defame and create fear,” while the foreign ministry’s head of European affairs, Johnson Chiang, called the allegations “pure defamation and calumny.”

CCTV’s airing of videoed confessions have prompted lawsuits abroad amid accusations that the accounts were coerced and that the broadcaster is merely a propaganda arm of the Communist Party.

The latest reports come amid increasing Chinese diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan aimed at compelling the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen to recognize Beijing’s claim that the island is a part of Chinese territory. While the sides share strong cultural and economic links, a strong majority of Taiwanese reject any moves toward political union with China, and Tsai was overwhelmingly reelected to a second term this year.

In its report Monday night, CCTV said Cheng had been detained by China’s state security agency, which accused him of using his academic post in the Czech Republic as a cover to collect intelligence, recruit mainland personnel and sow discord between China and other European countries.

19,2020/10/13,Pakistani dissidents blame military for country’s crises,"At key summit, participants call Imran a ‘military puppet’

Terming Prime Minister Imran Khan as a “military puppet,” prominent Pakistani dissidents, including former and current members of Parliament, have blamed the powerful army for the country’s fragility, insecurity and inability to get along with its neighbours.

“Pakistan is under unannounced martial law,” Pashtun leader and former Senator Afrasiab Khattak told the fifth annual conference of South Asians Against Terrorism and for Human Rights (SAATH).

SAATH is a group of pro-democracy Pakistanis co-founded by former Pakistan Ambassador the U.S. Husain Haqqani and U.S.-based columnist Dr. Mohammad Taqi. Previous annual conferences of SAATH have been held in London and Washington but this year participants met virtually, according to a statement.

The participants termed Prime Minister Khan as a military puppet”, it said.

Members of the group include politicians, journalists, bloggers, social media activists, and members of civil society, many of whom have been forced to live in exile in various countries.

Pakistan’s security services have tried to disrupt SAATH meetings in the past and banned its members living in Pakistan from travelling abroad, but this year, the virtual format enabled several prominent dissidents still in the country to participate, the statement said.

‘Minorities are oppressed’

“This is the most dangerous martial law in Pakistan because it has vulgarised and distorted constitutional institutions,” Mr. Khattak said.

Greece will not hold talks with Turkey on defusing tension in the eastern Mediterranean unless Ankara withdraws an energy research ship from contested areas, a senior Minister said on Tuesday.

A dispute over gas exploration saw the two NATO countries stage rival military drills in August in strategic waters between Cyprus and the Greek island of Crete.

21,2020/10/13,"Pakistan likely to remain on FATF greylist, say sources","In latest review, Islamabad cleared only 21 of 27 action points on terror financing

Pakistan is unlikely to exit the Financial Action Task Force (FATF’s) greylist next week, when the plenary session of the Paris-based global terror-financing watchdog is held, after its latest evaluation saw it clear 21 of 27 action points, with six key areas outstanding where Pakistan has yet to show progress.

According to sources, there is still no consensus amongst the 39-member FATF, which includes the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia, to blacklist Pakistan, despite its failure to meet its original deadline in September 2019, which would mean the group would maintain status quo and continue Pakistan on the greylist until February 2021.

On Tuesday, the International Co-operation Review Group (ICRG) of the FATF held a meeting to discuss the final recommendation to the watchdog’plenary session on October 21-23.

“Much will depend on the approach adopted to review the performance. Rather than going by mere statistics, if the member nations take cognisance of the inaction in cases like 26/11 Mumbai attacks, Pulwama attack and the Daniel Pearl murder case, an explanation may be sought from Pakistan,” a government official told The Hindu. He added that the decision by U.S. and European countries would be key.

At the plenary next week, Pakistan needs at least 3 of 39 members to keep it off the blacklist, and the support of 12 of 39 members to exit the “greylist”.

Last week Pakistani media reported that Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had telephoned his counterparts in several countries including Turkey, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, in an effort to “apprise” them of steps taken by Pakistan to comply with the FATF’s demands. On Sunday, Mr. Qureshi even claimed that Pakistan would be off the FATF greylist “soon”.

In the past two months, the Imran Khan government has brought eight new laws to parliament in an effort to enhance its rating with the FATF.

However, it is the support of the United States, considered crucial, that has not yet swung in favour of Pakistan, despite some hopes in Islamabad that cooperation in pushing talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government would help its chances at the FATF.

The six points of failure in the FATF’s 27-point action list include Pakistan’s lack of action against charitable organisations or NPOs (Non-profit organisations) connected to terror groups banned by the UN Security Council, and delays in prosecution of banned individuals and entities like Lashkar e Toiba chief Hafiz Saeed and LeT operations chief Zaki Ur Rahman Lakhvi, as well as Jaish-e- Mohammad chief Masood Azhar.

While Saeed was sentenced in February this year to 11 years in prison for terror financing, and remains behind bars, the Pakistan government claims the others are “untraceable”.

There have been few convictions of terror commanders of UN-designated entities affiliated to the Al Qaeda and the Haqqani network, and Pakistan has been found non-compliant in cracking down on terror financing through narcotics and smuggling of mining products including precious stones.

The FATF process has also shown concern about 4,000 names that were on Pakistan’s Schedule-IV list under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) being dropped in 2019.

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s chances at exiting the greylist suffered another blow as the APG released its evaluation of Islamabad’s actions in complying with the FATF, clearing it on only about 11 of 40 parameters. The APG review, that only takes into account actions taken until February 2020, decided to recommend Pakistan be kept in “expedited (enhanced) Follow Up (EEFU), which means more regular scrutiny of its government’s progress, in addition to its FATF greylist commitments.

The greylist refers to countries that are “monitored jurisdictions”, while the blacklist refers to countries facing a “call to action” or severe banking strictures, sanctions and difficulties in accessing loans. In February this year, the FATF had threatened Pakistan with a potential blacklist in a sternly worded note that said, “All deadlines in the action plan have expired.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sha6db/article32607564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FATF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pak-likely-to-remain-on-fatf-greylist-say-sources/article32845713.ece
22,2020/10/13,Coronavirus | Europe eyes new restrictions as virus cases hit record high,"The increasing case numbers are partly the result of more testing, but the U.N. health agency noted that deaths were also up 16% in the region last week compared to the previous week.

Governments across Europe are ratcheting up restrictions in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus as the continent recorded its highest weekly number of new infections since the start of the pandemic.

The World Health Organization said on Tuesday there were more than 700,000 new COVID-19 cases reported in Europe last week, a jump of 34% compared to the previous week, with Britain, France, Russia and Spain accounting for more than half of new infections recorded in the region.

The increasing case numbers are partly the result of more testing, but the U.N. health agency noted that deaths were also up 16% in the region last week compared to the previous week.

Doctors are also warning that while many new cases are currently in younger people, who tend to have milder symptoms, the virus could again start spreading widely in older populations, likely resulting in more serious illnesses.

In response to the latest numbers, Italy and France are restricting parties and putting limits on restaurants and bars, while Slovenia is considering similar measures. Britain unveiled a new three-tiered system for deciding what restrictions to impose based on how severe the outbreak is in certain areas.

Those moves reflect a new approach to containing the virus among governments wary of hurting already fragile economies. Even as infections surge, officials are eager to avoid the total lockdowns they imposed in the spring that resulted in massive job losses.

Instead, they are relying on a patchwork of regional or targeted restrictions that have sometimes caused confusion and frustration by those affected.

The U.N. health agency appeared support the new approach, with WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic telling reporters on Tuesday in Geneva that lockdowns should be a last resort.

Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte ordered bans on pickup sports games among friends and parties in closed spaces. Private gatherings at homes with more than six people who don’t live together are also discouraged.

Like other European countries, Italy is also limiting nightlife, with bars and restaurants having to close at midnight, and drinking while standing at a bar banned after 9 p.m.

The annual Giro d’Italia was thrown into chaos Tuesday after several top riders withdrew from the cycling race following a series of positive tests for the coronavirus.

Italy made wearing masks mandatory outdoors last week, a requirement already in place in Spain, Turkey, India and a handful of other Asian countries. Elsewhere in Europe, such mandates are in effect in many places in Poland and hot spot cities like Paris, Brussels and Pristina, Kosovo, and are being introduced in several German cities.

French President Emmanuel Macron held a meeting on Tuesday with his national defense council focusing on the virus. The latest figures have shown a rapid increase of infections especially in big cities.

Paris, Marseille and seven other large cities have been placed under maximum virus alert, resulting in the closure of bars, gyms and swimming pools. Public parties are banned and restaurants have to ensure a minimum 1-meter (3-foot) distance between tables, with groups of diners limited to six people.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki urged the country’s citizens to observe social distancing, wear masks and disinfect hands and spaces used as he himself went into quarantine following contact with someone who later tested positive for COVID-19.

Mr Morawiecki said in a video message that his government was working as usual and that he didn’t have any symptoms.

Poland, a nation of about 38 million, has seen a sharp spike in new daily registered infections, with 5,068 cases and 63 deaths reported Tuesday. In the summer, the new daily cases were around 600, but the numbers started rising quickly after the end of vacation.

Some doctors are warning that the chronically underfunded health care system may give in if the current rate of new cases continues.

Officials in Slovenia said they are also eyeing closures of bars, restaurants and gyms, months after becoming one of the first European countries to declare the outbreak over. Now, as case numbers rise, government spokesman Jelko Kacin said Slovenian authorities are also considering banning religious ceremonies and weddings.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has summoned the governors of Germany’s 16 States to meet in person Wednesday for the first time since mid-June.

In Britain, which has suffered the deadliest outbreak in Europe, officials defended their new system as striking the right balance. Under the plan unveiled Monday night, the northern city of Liverpool is in the highest-risk category and its pubs, gyms and betting shops have been shut.

“The prime minister has to balance protecting people’s lives and the NHS (National Health Service) from the virus while also prioritizing things that matter to us as a society, like education and keeping as many people in employment as possible, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC on Tuesday Britain’s number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has more than tripled in the last three weeks, with infection rates rising across all age groups and regions.

Germany’s Europe minister, Michael Roth, stressed that as the deadline to have an outline deal on a basic trade relationship has whittled down to days and weeks instead of months, key priorities still need to be addressed by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Frankly speaking, we are at a very critical stage in the negotiations,” Mr. Roth said. Time is running out. That’s why we expect substantial progress” in key areas centering on rules to ensure fair economic competition, legal oversight of any deal and fisheries.

Mr. Roth’s French counterpart, Clement Beaune, said that particularly on access of U.K. companies to the E.U. market, the bloc had to be very strict in making sure British firms would not be able to undercut their continental rivals because of minimal regulation and excessive State subsidies.

“Otherwise we would have unfair competition which is not backed by our citizens, companies and workers,” Mr. Beaune said.

Mr. Johnson has long billed the two-day E.U. summit that starts Thursday as an ultimate deadline, while the 27-nation E.U. is willing to negotiate until early November to craft a deal, however basic.

Since last month, the member States have also become ardent in demanding legal guarantees on governance of any deal since Mr. Johnson in September introduced legislation that breaches the Brexit withdrawal agreement he himself signed with the E.U. only last year.

The E.U. has said that any agreement will take about two months for legal ratification, translation into the many E.U. languages and for approval from the E.U. parliament, making for an effective cutoff date around Nov. 1.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rkxaut/article31958660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EUFLAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/germany-france-call-for-uk-concessions-in-eu-uk-trade-talks/article32845029.ece
24,2020/10/13,Bangladesh President signs ordinance on capital punishment in rape cases,"The Law Ministry in a statement said that from now on the “death penalty” instead of “lifetime rigorous imprisonment” would be the maximum punishment for rape.

Bangladesh President Md Abdul Hamid on Tuesday signed an ordinance approving the death penalty for rapists, amid nationwide protests after a series of recent sexual assaults in the country.

“The President assented the Cabinet decision and issued an ordinance on Women and Children Repression Prevention Act,” a presidential palace spokesman told PTI.

On Monday, the Cabinet approved an increase in the maximum punishment in rape cases to death from life imprisonment.

The Law Ministry in a statement said that from now on the “death penalty” instead of “lifetime rigorous imprisonment” would be the maximum punishment for rape.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said that the government has introduced capital punishment in rape cases in an effort to prevent the “brutality” of rapists.

“A man when he is a rapist turns into an animal. They become so brutal; that is why women suffer so much these days. Hence we amended the law,” she said while speaking at an event here on Tuesday.

“Besides the life-term imprisonment, we have elevated the maximum punishment for rape to death and approved it in the cabinet. As the parliament is not in session right now, we’re issuing an ordinance,” she said.

Bangladesh was rocked over the weekend by an unprecedented level of protest after footage of a brutal gang assault on a woman went viral on social media. Demonstrators carried signs reading “Hang the rapists” and “No mercy to rapists”.

The changes to the law were demanded by thousands of demonstrators across the Muslim-majority nation calling for more stringent punishments for the perpetrators of sexual assaults.

Police arrested eight suspects after the video of the assault went viral more than a month after the attack occurred at the victim’s home in Noakhali.

In a separate case, another woman was allegedly gang-raped last week in a hostel in the northern district of Sylhet, leading to the arrest of several members of the student wing of the ruling party.

Protesters in the capital Dhaka and elsewhere have demanded stiffer punishments for rape, faster trials for rapists and an end to what they see as a culture of impunity.

According to rights group Ain O Salish Kendra or ASK, at least 889 women have been raped in Bangladesh between January and August 2020.

Rights activists believe the numbers are much higher because many of the victims do not complain to the police.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/66pal3/article32844807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BANGLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bangladesh-president-signs-ordinance-on-capital-punishment-in-rape-cases/article32844808.ece
25,2020/10/13,"Race hate crimes spike in England, religious crimes down","There were 105,090 hate crimes recorded in the past year, which marks an increase of 8% on the previous year, according to the data released by U.K. Home Office

Racially aggravated attacks registered a spike in hate crimes recorded in England and Wales in 2019-2020 even as religious hate crimes showed a downward trend, according to official U.K. Home Office statistics released on Tuesday.

There were 105,090 hate crimes recorded in the past year, which marks an increase of 8% on the previous year, with race hate crimes rising by around 4,000.

As in previous years, the majority of hate crimes were race hate crimes, accounting for around three-quarters of offences (72% or 76,070 offences). These increased by 6% between 2018/19 and 2019/20, notes the Home Office report.

Religious hate crimes fell by 5% (to 6,822 offences), down from a peak of 7,203 in the previous year. This was the first fall in religious hate crimes since 2012-13, it said.

In 2019-20, where the perceived religion of the victim was recorded, 50% of religious hate crime offences were targeted against Muslims (3,089 offences), with the next most commonly targeted group being Jewish people, who were targeted in 19 per cent of religious hate crimes (1,205 offences).

Sikh Federation U.K. claimed that while reported religious hate crimes in the last 12 months fell for other religions, for Sikhs it has increased by 7.3%, and related it to raised awareness within the Sikh community of the importance of reporting hate crimes.

The Home Office analysis also shows that racially aggravated hate crime jumped significantly during the Black Lives Matter protests. During the coronavirus lockdown in March, April and early May hate crime offences showed a drop, but in June and July the number of racially or religiously-aggravated offences was up a third on the previous year.

The increases seen in June and July 2020 were likely to be related to the Black Lives Matters protests and far-right groups counter-protests in England and Wales following the death of George Floyd on the 25 May in the United States of America, the report said.

Statistics show a sharp increase in offences of causing fear, alarm or distress, which commonly arise out of demonstrations. Hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation increased by the largest percentage, by 19 per cent to 15,800, followed by transgender identity by 16 per cent to 2,500.

Around half of hate crimes were public order offences, such as stirring up racial hatred, threatening violence and causing harassment. More than a third were violence against the person offences and 5% were criminal damage and arson.

The Home Office said increases in hate crime figures over the past five years had been mainly driven by improvements in the way police record hate crime but also highlighted that spikes in such incidents do occur following certain events, such as the Brexit referendum in 2016 and terrorist attacks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/70clla/article32844433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ukjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/race-hate-crimes-spike-in-england-religious-crimes-down/article32844434.ece
26,2020/10/13,China’s Foreign Minister says U.S. using Quad to build ‘Indo-Pacific NATO’,"Chinese officials describe it as part of a broader American effort in the region to “contain” Beijing

In China’s most high-profile criticism so far on the Quad, its Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday said Washington was aiming to build an “Indo-Pacific NATO” that would be founded on the U.S., India, Japan and Australia grouping

Mr. Wang’s remarks, during a visit to Malaysia, underline how Chinese officials, who once sought to downplay the Quad as an overhyped idea are now highlighting it prominently, describing it as part of a broader American effort in the region to “contain” China, as ties continue to worsen between Beijing and Washington.

In 2018, Mr. Wang dismissed the then recently-revived Quad and the Indo-Pacific concept as a “headline-grabbing idea” that would “dissipate like sea foam”

Mr. Wang’s visit to Malaysia is the second stop of his five-nation tour to southeast Asia. He arrived there following a visit to Cambodia, and will later travel to Laos and Thailand, and stop in Singapore.

“In essence, [the Indo-Pacific strategy] aims to build a so-called Indo-Pacific NATO underpinned by the quadrilateral mechanism involving the United States, Japan, India and Australia,” he said, reported the South China Morning Post.

“What it pursues is to trumpet the Cold War mentality and to stir up confrontation among different groups and blocs and to stoke geopolitical competition. What it maintains is the dominance and hegemonic system of the United States,” he observed.

“In this sense, this strategy is itself a big underlying security risk. If it is forced forward, it will wind back the clock of history,” he added.

The Tokyo meeting

Last week, following the October 6 Quad ministerial meeting in Tokyo, China said it was opposed to “organising closed and exclusive cliques”.

At the Tokyo meet, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo singled out China as a threat to the region, although the three other foreign ministers, including External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, did not directly mention China. They did, however, express broad concerns about maintaining a rules-based order, freedom of navigation and the peaceful resolution of disputes in the region.

“As partners in this Quad, it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the Chinese Communist Party’s exploitation, corruption, and coercion,” Mr. Pompeo said. “We’ve seen it in the South China Sea, in the East China Sea, the Mekong, the Himalayas, the Taiwan Straits. These are just a few examples.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/91z075/article32844083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WANGYI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-fm-calls-us-indo-pacific-strategy-a-huge-security-risk/article32844084.ece

It gave no details about the content of the report.

The judge investigating a massive blast in Beirut that killed and wounded many people two months ago has received a report from the FBI about their own probe of the blast, state-run National News Agency reported on Tuesday.

The news agency said Judge Fadi Sawwan received the FBI report on Monday, adding that he is still waiting for similar reports from French and British explosives experts. It gave no details about the content of the report.

Watch | Massive explosion in Beirut

The August 4 blast at Beirut’s port killed nearly 200 people, injured about 6,500 and caused damage worth billions of dollars. Nearly 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilizers, exploded at Beirut’s port. The material had been stored at the facility for six years.

It is still not known what ignited the nitrate but more than two dozen people, many of them port and customs officials have been detained since. Mr. Sawwan, the judge in charge of the investigation, has questioned top security officials, former cabinet ministers and port employees.

NNA said the reports by foreign investigation teams will specify the cause behind the explosion of the nitrates and the nature of the explosion and whether there was an intentional act of sabotage, or whether the blast was the result of a mistake or misestimation about the dangers of the material that exploded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yuarka/article32273789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001WA36Ujpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/judge-probing-lebanons-beirut-blast-receives-report-from-fbi-investigation/article32843754.ece
28,2020/10/13,Assad makes rare visit to areas hit by fires in west Syria,"Mr. Assad’s public visits to areas around Syria have been rare since the country’s conflict began in March 2011.

Syrian President Bashar Assad has made a rare public visit to the coastal province of Latakia where he toured areas that suffered heavy damage in last week’s wildfires that killed three people, state media reported on Tuesday.

Mr. Assad’s public visits to areas around Syria have been rare since the country’s conflict began in March 2011. The conflict has killed nearly 400,000 and displaced half of Syria’s population including more than five million who became refugees, mostly in neighbouring countries.

State news agency SANA said Mr. Assad visited the village of Ballouran to inspect the damage and met the local population during a tour to some areas that were affected by the fires, which were brought under control on Sunday.

SANA did not say whether the visit took place on Tuesday or earlier.

SANA said Mr. Assad was accompanied by the ministers of local administration and agriculture and vowed to help residents replant the burnt areas.

Wildfires broke out in several Middle Eastern countries last week amid a heat wave that is unusual for this time of the year, leaving Syria particularly hard-hit. Three people were killed in the wildfires that also burned wide areas of forests, mostly in Latakia and the central province of Homs.

On Saturday, special prayers for rain were held in mosques around different parts of Syria, in hopes that rain would ease the drought and stop the fires.

29,2020/10/13,U.N. climate report urges governments to put more money into early-warning systems,"“While COVID-19 generated a large international health and economic crisis from which it will take years to recover, it is crucial to remember that climate change will continue to pose an on-going and increasing threat,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.

In the wake of heat waves, global warming, forest fires, storms, droughts and a rising number of hurricanes, the U.N. weather agency is warning that the number of people who need international humanitarian help could rise 50% by 2030 compared to the 108 million who needed it worldwide in 2018.

In a new report released with partners on Tuesday, the World Meteorological Agency says more disasters attributed to weather are taking place each year.

It said over 11,000 disasters have been attributed to weather, climate and phenomena like tsunamis that are related to water over the last 50 years - causing 2 million deaths and racking up $3.6 trillion worth of economic costs.

In one hopeful development over that period, the average number of deaths from each separate weather disaster per year has dropped by one-third, even as the number of such events and the economic costs from them have both surged.

The 2020 State of Climate Services report, compiled by 16 international agencies and financing institutions, calls on governments to put more money into early-warning systems that can improve countries’ ability to prepare for, respond to and mitigate the impact of such natural disasters.

“While COVID-19 generated a large international health and economic crisis from which it will take years to recover, it is crucial to remember that climate change will continue to pose an on-going and increasing threat to human lives, ecosystems, economies and societies for centuries to come,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.

30,2020/10/13,"Belarus ramps up crackdown on protests, detains over 700","Despite the detentions, protests in Belarus continued on Monday.

Authorities in Belarus said Monday they detained 713 people during mass protests a day earlier against the reelection of the country’s authoritarian leader in a disputed election — the harshest crackdown in weeks on demonstrators.

The Interior Ministry reported that out of those detained Sunday, 570 of them were still in custody awaiting a court hearing. In a separate statement, the ministry threatened to “use firearms against the protesters if need be,” saying that the rallies have become organized and extremely radical.

Despite the detentions, protests in Belarus continued Monday, with the elderly taking to the streets in several Belarusian cities, demanding Lukashenko’s resignation. More than 2,000 people marched through Minsk, chanting ‘Go away!’ and carrying signs saying ‘Grandmothers (stand) with the people and our souls are scarred with terror’. Several people were detained.

The protests demanding the resignation of President Alexander Lukashenko spanned several cities on Sunday, with the largest crowds gathering in the capital, Minsk. The Viasna human rights center estimated that around 100,000 people took part in the Minsk rally. Police quickly moved to disperse the protest with water cannons, stun grenades and truncheons, preventing groups of people in different parts of the city from merging into one large gathering.

Dozens of people sustained injuries in what human rights advocates said was the harshest dispersal of a Sunday demonstration since August.

Mass protests have rocked Belarus since August 9, when the results of the presidential election handed Lukashenko a victory with 80% of the vote and his main challenger Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya only 10%. Tsikhanouskaya and her supporters refused to recognise the results of the vote, saying it was riddled with fraud, and some poll workers have backed up that claim.

Both the European Union and the United States have said that presidential election was neither free nor fair.

In the first days of the protests, Belarusian authorities cracked down brutally on protesters, with police detaining thousands and beating scores.

The violent response to the rallies prompted international outrage. The EU and the United States slapped dozens of Belarusian officials with sanctions for their roles in the alleged vote-rigging and the crackdown on protesters, but didn’t target Lukashenko, who has run the country for 26 years with an iron fist.

The government has since scaled back on the violence but has maintained the pressure, detaining hundreds of protesters and prosecuting top activists. Prominent members of the opposition’s Coordination Council, which was formed to push for a transition of power, have been arrested or forced to leave the country.

Over 40 journalists were detained over the weekend, 25 of them in Minsk, the Belarusian Association of Journalists said. Fifteen Belarusian journalists in Minsk face up to 15 days of administrative arrest for disobeying police officers. Many had their equipment seized.

The authorities are trying to prevent coverage of the protests by beating up and detaining journalists, withdrawing their accreditation and creating catastrophic working conditions, Andrei Bastunets, head of the journalists’ association, told The Associated Press.

Earlier this month Belarusian authorities rescinded the accreditation of all journalists working for foreign news outlets and said they must apply for new credentials, which some foreign outlets received last week. In September, the authorities also suspended the media credentials of the most popular independent Belarusian news site that has been extensively covering the protests.

Tsikhanouskaya, who is currently in exile in Lithuania after leaving Belarus under pressure from authorities, urged the EU to expand sanctions against Lukashenko and his allies.

“Yesterday we have seen the escalation of violence on the part of the authorities. Once again, hundreds of people are detained, beaten up, injured and crippled. Despite the peaceful nature of the protests, repressions are intensifying,” Tsikhanouskaya told the AP on Monday.

“Lukashenko and his associates need to be added to the sanctions list along with law enforcement officers who take part in crackdowns on protesters,” she added.

“I call on our European partners to act quickly and decisively,” Tsikhanouskaya said.

EU officials on Monday said they saw no improvement in Belarus and were ready to impose further sanctions on top Belarus officials, including Lukashenko.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a meeting of foreign ministers of the bloc that there has been a complete lack of will from Lukashenko’s side to engage in negotiations, contacts on anything that could bring a democratic, a peaceful solution to the situation in Belarus.

The ministers warned that the EU stands ready to take further restrictive measures, including against entities and high-ranking officials, including A. Lukashenko. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, meanwhile, was concerned by some of the violence that we’ve seen and has said on a number of occasions it’s very important that there be an inclusive democratic dialogue involving all stakeholders in Belarus to try to get out of this crisis, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cao77f/article32841355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BELARUS-ELECTIONPROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/belarus-ramps-up-crackdown-on-protests-detains-over-700/article32841356.ece
31,2020/10/13,"Vatican putting 2 priests on trial accused of abuse, coverup","The trial, confirmed Monday by the Holy See press office, marks the first known time that the Vatican has criminally prosecuted a case of sexual abuse that allegedly occurred within its walls

Two priests are going on trial in the Vatican’s criminal tribunal this week, one accused of sexually abusing an altar boy who served at papal Masses in St. Peter’s Basilica, and the other accused of covering it up.

The trial, confirmed Monday by the Holy See press office, marks the first known time that the Vatican has criminally prosecuted a case of sexual abuse that allegedly occurred within its walls.

The proceedings starting Thursday were forced on the Holy See after victims and a whistleblower went public in 2017. Their stories undermined Pope Francis’ pledges of zero tolerance for abuse because the alleged crimes occurred in his own backyard and had gone unpunished for years.

The case concerns the closed world of the St. Pius X youth seminary, a palazzo inside the Vatican walls just across the street from where Francis lives. The seminary serves as a residence for about a dozen boys, aged 12 to 18, who serve as altar boys at papal Masses.

A onetime seminarian, the Rev. Gabriele Martinelli, is accused of molesting a younger seminarian when he himself was a senior altar boy at St. Pius X. The Rev. Enrico Radice was the rector of the seminary at the time, and is accused of aiding and abetting the crime.

Neither Martinelli nor Radice has responded publicly to the accusations. The order that runs the seminary, the Opera Don Folchi, has said the allegations were mud and calumny,” though the diocese of Como where both men are now priests has removed them from ministry with minors pending an outcome of the case.

The scandal is particularly grave because the allegations of abuse were known since at least 2012 but were covered up for years by the Vatican and the diocese of Como, until they were exposed by Italian journalists Gaetano Pecoraro and Gianluigi Nuzzi in 2017.

Eyewitness

They relied on the eyewitness testimony of the victim’s roommate, Kamil Jarzembowski, who was kicked out of the seminary after first reporting the abuse privately to church authorities in 2012.

Jarzembowski has said he saw his roommate repeatedly molested by Martinelli at night when Martinelli would enter their dorm room. He has said the molestation began when both were minors and continued after Martinelli turned 18.

Speaking Monday to The Associated Press, Jarzembowski said he was hopeful justice would finally be served.

“I hope it’s a just trial, in front of impartial judges,” he said. I want to go into the tribunal and look them in the eye.” Jarzembowski has been called as a witness for the prosecution.

Usually if it investigates sexual abuse at all, the Catholic Church prosecutes accused priests according to the canon law, the church’s in-house legal system that can impose a maximum penalty of defrocking.

In this case, because the alleged crimes occurred within the confines of Vatican City, the city state’s criminal prosecutors also have jurisdiction and decided to charge the two priests and bring the case to trial.

The first hearing Thursday is expected to be largely technical in nature. The Vatican is allowing a small pool of two reporters to attend, limiting the number because of COVID-19 restrictions.

The diocese of Como, which ordained Martinelli a priest after initially clearing him of the allegations, now insists that it restricted his ministry after new elements emerged in 2017. The diocese says it was committed to finding the truth even recognizing possible delays or omissions committed in the past.”

A series of bishops, including Cardinal Angelo Comastri, the archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica, said they investigated the allegations, but no one ever interviewed Jarzembowski’s roommate.

The case is emblematic of the inherent conflicts of interest in the canon law system and the church’s refusal to require abuse be reported to impartial police. Bishops are tasked with investigating allegations of abuse, but they also invest time and money for training the accused priests and need them to fill Mass schedules and perform pastoral work.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/r9nkkm/article32841022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDVATICANPOPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vatican-putting-2-priests-on-trial-accused-of-abuse-coverup/article32841023.ece

Drugmaker Pfizer has again modified the protocol for its late-stage study of its vaccine against the novel coronavirus, this time to include more young participants.

The company said Monday that it’s received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to include adolescents aged 12 through 15 in its global COVID-19 vaccine study.

New York-based Pfizer originally planned for 30,000 participants, but in September expanded that to 44,000 people. That increase was made to boost diversity in the trial population, specifically by including 16- and 17-year-old teens, as well as stable patients with some common chronic infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.

Pfizer’s trial also includes significant numbers of Hispanic, African-American, Asian and Native American participants, plus many people aged 56 through 85.

33,2020/10/13,WHO warns against pursuing herd immunity to stop coronavirus,"Tedros said that WHO estimates less than 10% of the population has any immunity to the coronavirus, meaning the vast majority of the world remains susceptible.

The head of the World Health Organization warned against the idea that herd immunity might be a realistic strategy to stop the coronavirus pandemic, calling such proposals “unethical.”

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press briefing on Monday that health officials typically aim to achieve herd immunity — where the entire population is protected from a virus when the majority are immune — by vaccination. Tedros noted that to obtain herd immunity from measles, for example, about 95% of the population must be vaccinated.

""Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it,” he said. “Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak,” he said, calling the strategy “scientifically and ethically problematic.”

Tedros said that WHO estimates less than 10% of the population has any immunity to the coronavirus, meaning the vast majority of the world remains susceptible.

34,2020/10/13,Malaysia's Anwar meets king in bid to form new government,"The opposition leader spent about an hour at the palace before leaving

Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was to meet the nation’s king Tuesday in a bid to form a new government after claiming he had secured a majority in Parliament.

Mr. Anwar said last week that he would present the monarch with “strong and convincing” documentary evidence of the support he has from lawmakers, which would allow him to unseat Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.

Mr. Anwar spent about an hour at the palace before leaving. He did not speak to reporters gathered at the gate.

Mr. Muhyiddin, who took power in March after securing enough support in Parliament to unseat Mr. Anwar’s reformist alliance, has dismissed Mr. Anwar’s claim to a majority. Mr. Muhyiddin currently boasts a slim two-seat majority and has been grappling to maintain support amid infighting in his coalition.

Allies inMr. Muhyiddin’s ruling coalition have denied supporting Mr. Anwar, and branded Mr. Anwar a “desperado” for seeking to wrest power as the country struggles with the coronavirus.

The audience with the king was slated three weeks ago, but postponed as the king was hospitalised. Mr. Anwar has been tight-lipped and said he would only reveal details after meeting the king.

""I frankly do not think it will be a smooth and easy ride for Mr. Anwar. For one, even if the king is convinced of Mr. Anwar’s command of parliamentary majority, the king still has the alternative constitutional option of dissolving the parliament,” said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.

Oh, a Malaysian, said support for Mr. Anwar could also have waned as Mr. Muhyiddin’s camp may have lured back defectors in the past three weeks.

Before leaving home Tuesday morning, Mr. Anwar tweeted a picture of himself and his wife. “Hopefully it will be a smooth affair today,” he wrote.

Mr. Anwar’s Alliance of Hope was elected in 2018 but collapsed after Muhyiddin withdrew his party and tied up with opposition parties to form a Malay-centric government in March. Then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned in protest, saying he wouldn’t work with parties accused of corruption that he ousted in the 2018 polls.

If Mr. Anwar succeeds, it will mark a dramatic comeback after his roller-coaster political journey since the 1990s.

Once a high flyer in the ruling party, Mr. Anwar was convicted of homosexual sodomy and corruption after a power struggle with Mahathir in 1998. He was imprisoned for a second time for sodomy in 2014.

Mr. Anwar and his supporters have long denied the sodomy allegations, saying they were concocted to destroy his political career.

Rather than give up, Mr. Anwar ended his feud with Mr. Mahathir from his prison cell to forge a the Alliance of Hope, which in the 2018 polls defeated the coalition that had led Malaysia for 61 years.

Mr. Mahathir became premier a second time.

Johnson & Johnson has paused clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate due to an unexplained illness in a study participant, delaying one of the highest profile efforts to contain the global pandemic.

The Hindu Explains | Why is Phase-3 of COVID-19 vaccine trial complicated?

The move comes around a month after AstraZeneca also suspended trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine — which uses a similar technology — due to a participant falling ill.

J&J said on Monday the illness was being reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring board as well as the U.S. group’s clinical and safety physicians

The company, which reports quarterly financial results on Tuesday morning, said such pauses are normal in big trials, which can include tens of thousands of people. It added the voluntary “study pause” in giving doses of the vaccine candidate was different from a “regulatory hold” imposed by health authorities.

AstraZeneca last month paused late-stage trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine developed with the University of Oxford due to an unexplained illness in a British study participant.

While AstraZeneca’s trials in Britain, Brazil, South Africa and India have since resumed, its U.S. trial is still on hold, pending a regulatory review.

The J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines are both based on a so-called adenovirus, a harmless modified virus that instructs human cells to produce vaccine proteins.

Safety concerns

They are both also part of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed programme to support vaccine development.

“This could be a second case of adenoviral vaccine to spur safety concerns,” said Bryan Garnier analyst Olga Smolentseva.

Companies are required to investigate any serious or unexpected reaction that occurs during drug testing. Given that such tests are done on tens of thousands of people, some medical problems are a coincidence. In fact, one of the first steps the company said it will take is to determine if the person received the vaccine or a placebo.

The halt was first reported by the health news site STAT.

Final-stage testing of a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University remains on hold in the US as officials examine whether an illness in its trial poses a safety risk. That trial was stopped when a woman developed severe neurological symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis, a rare inflammation of the spinal cord, the company has said. That company’s testing has restarted elsewhere.

36,2020/10/13,U.K. unveils 3-level COVID-19 lockdown plan,"While the measures curb social interactions and the leisure industry, shops, schools and universities will remain open in all areas.

The British government carved England into three tiers of coronavirus risk on Monday in a bid to slow a resurgent outbreak, putting the northern city of Liverpool into the highest-risk category and shutting its pubs, gyms and betting shops.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the three-level national system was designed to “simplify and standardise” a confusing patchwork of local rules, as the country enters a “crucial phase.” Mr. Johnson said hospitals are now filling up with more COVID-19 patients than in March, when he ordered a national lockdown.

Watch | Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine shows positive results

""These figures are flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet, and we must act now,” he said during a televised news conference.

Mr. Johnson told lawmakers that the goal of the new system was to save lives without “shuttering our lives and our society” through a new national lockdown. While the measures curb social interactions and the leisure industry, Mr. Johnson said shops, schools and universities will remain open in all areas.

Some scientists questioned whether the restrictions went far enough. Minutes published Monday from meetings of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies showed the body recommended three weeks ago that the government consider stricter measures including a short “circuit-breaker” lockdown.

Watch | The immune system's response to a coronavirus attack

The government rejected the idea.

""I and other people who were advocating for quite stringent severe local interventions where necessary three to four weeks ago, our fear is that we’re in another place now,” said Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool and a member of the the advisory committee.

After falling during the summer, coronavirus cases are rising in the U.K. as winter approaches, with northwest and northeast England seeing the steepest increases. Liverpool has one of the country’s most severe outbreaks, with about 600 cases per 100,000 people, even more than the hard-hit European cities of Madrid and Brussels.

Under the new measures, areas in England are classified at medium, high or very high risk, and placed under restrictions of varying severity.

Areas in the lowest tier will follow existing national restrictions, including a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants and a ban on more than six people gathering. In areas at high risk, members of different households are barred from meeting indoors.

The “very high” risk tier will face restrictions including closing pubs - apart from those that serve meals - and, if local authorities want, other venues such as gyms and casinos.

Liverpool was the only area put into the top category Monday, but Mr. Johnson said authorities were still talking with other local leaders across the north of England.

Pubs, gyms, leisure centers, betting shops and casinos in Liverpool will close beginning Wednesday.

Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said local authorities supported tougher restrictions as long as they were accompanied by improved test-and-trace measures to suppress clusters of infections - something he said the government had agreed to.

""As well as protecting lives and doing things to tackle the virus, we also need to protect livelihoods, so we argued really strongly for a stronger financial package,” said Anderson, a member of the opposition Labour Party. “Unfortunately, that wasn’t listened to.”

The government has announced a support package to pay two-thirds of the salaries of employees of companies that are told to close, but many in the pub and restaurant sector say that is not enough to save already struggling businesses.

Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said he doubted the new measures would go far enough to “get control of this virus, to protect jobs or retain public trust.”

The U.K. has experienced Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with an official death toll of 42,875. Health officials say Britain is at a tipping point in the outbreak, with strong action needed to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed at a time when they are already at their busiest with flu and other winter illnesses.

Stephen Powis, medical director of the National Health Service in England, said three temporary COVID-19 hospitals in northern England that were mothballed when the outbreak receded over the summer are being readied to admit patients once again in the coming weeks.

England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said Monday that while northern England has the highest infection rates, cases are on the rise across the country. Infections have risen most rapidly among older teenagers and young adults, who generally suffer mild symptoms, but are spreading to older and more at-risk groups.

""This is a nationwide phenomenon now,” Mr. Van-Tam said.

Bar and restaurant owners pushed back against the new restrictions, saying the government has not shared any evidence backing up the claim that they are the major transmission sources of the virus.

Manchester City Council leader Richard Leese said data from the city’s public health officials “seems to demonstrate that there is not a particular connection between bars and restaurants and the transmission of COVID.”

But Semple, the government scientific adviser, said “most of the outbreaks are happening within and between households, and then after that, it’s in the retail and hospitality sector.”

The measures announced Monday apply to England. The rest of the U.K. is under similar, and sometimes tougher, restrictions. In Scotland’s two biggest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, pubs have been closed for 16 days to suppress the outbreak.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v3s40j/article32840091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDBORISJOHNSON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-unveils-3-level-covid-19-lockdown-plan/article32840092.ece
37,2020/10/13,Kyrgyzstan President declares new state of emergency,"The confusion reflected the chaos that has engulfed the country after a disputed Parliamentary election triggered mass protests.

Kyrgyzstan’s President Sooronbai Jeenbekov on Monday ordered a new, week-long state of emergency in the country’s capital after Parliament failed to consider and approve his previous order within the legally required three days.

The confusion reflected the chaos that has engulfed the country after a disputed Parliamentary election triggered mass protests.

According to the office of President Sooronbai Jeenbekov, the state of emergency in Bishkek is to last from 8 p.m. Monday to 7 a.m. on Oct. 19 and implies a curfew, a ban on rallies and other public events, and travel restrictions. The new decree also reiterates the order to deploy troops to the capital to enforce the measure.

Mr. Jeenbekov’s previous decree declaring a state of emergency in Bishkek was signed Friday, when a protest in the city turned violent and gunshots were fired at several political leaders. It became void Monday, as lawmakers didn’t consider it within three days.

Kyrgyzstan, a country of 6.5 million located on the border with China, plunged into chaos last week after mass protests erupted the day after a parliamentary election appeared to show parties connected to the ruling elite winning. Protesters stormed and seized government buildings, looting some offices, and the Central Election Commission responded by nullifying Sunday’s balloting.

Members of some opposition parties announced plans to oust Mr. Jeenbekov and form a new government. An emergency Parliament session on Oct. 6 named former lawmaker Sadyr Zhaparov as a new prime minister, but the move was immediately contested by other opposition groups.

Lawmakers voted on Saturday to seal Mr. Zhaparov’s appointment, but Mr. Jeenbekov, who said he may consider stepping down only after the political situation in the country stabilizes, is yet to sign a decree confirming it.

Protests in Bishkek continued most of last week, with supporters of rival factions occasionally clashing with each other.

Jeenbekov declared a nearly two-week state of emergency in Bishkek on Friday and ordered the military to send troops to the capital in a bid to end the turmoil. Convoys of military trucks were seen driving into the city, but it wasn’t immediately clear whether police and the military would comply with the Presidential order.

A curfew in Bishkek was announced on Saturday and amended Monday, following Mr. Jeenbekov’s new decree, to last from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nfgxl1/article32840021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDKYRGY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kyrgyzstan-president-declares-new-state-of-emergency/article32840022.ece
38,2020/10/13,U.S. presidential election 2020 | President Trump back on campaign trail with a roar,"‘They say I am immune. I feel so powerful,’ he boasts at rally

“Here we are!” President Donald Trump announced with a triumphant roar — made slightly hoarse by his bout with COVID-19 — at the opening of a rally in Sanford, Florida, on Monday.

Just a week after getting out of hospital with the coronavirus, Mr. Trump strode onto the stage, tossing out face masks, like a rock star handing out autographs.

Defying the pandemic

But he wasn’t wearing a mask himself. And neither was anyone else, barring a small minority, in the crowd of several thousand, who were jammed cheek by jowl to witness the Republican’s return to the campaign trail.

Which was the whole point.

Mr. Trump wanted to show he can defy the pandemic and his seemingly plummeting chances of beating Democratic candidate Joe Biden alike.

Loud, coarse at times, diving into his well-worn jokes, and freely insulting opponents and journalists, Mr. Trump didn’t sound like a clinically obese man of 74 who only a few days ago was being administered oxygen by doctors.

“They say I’m immune,” he boasted. “I feel so powerful.”

From ditching his mask to parking the iconic Air Force One jumbo right behind the podium, this was a rally stage-managed to push Mr. Trump’s image as freak of nature unbound by the laws governing ordinary folks.

Maybe he wasn’t wearing a Superman shirt under his suit, as The New York Times reported he considered doing on being discharged from hospital October 5, but the crowd wouldn’t have been fazed had he done so.

“We love you, we love you,” they cheered.

Mr. Trump talks of enjoying a “protective glow” after getting over COVID-19.

The way Mr. Trump tells it, his special powers make him invincible against Mr. Biden too. Since reemerging from heavy treatment for the coronavirus he has mocked the Democrat’s travel schedule, his mask wearing and coughing.

39,2020/10/13,Bangladesh’s Cabinet approves death penalty in rape cases,"Previously, the maximum punishment for rape was life imprisonment.

Bangladesh introduced the death penalty for rape on Monday after days of protests sparked by a string of sexual assaults, the government said.

Demonstrations have broken out across the country after harrowing footage of a group of men stripping and attacking a woman went viral on social media. The clip sparked outrage in the South Asian country, where activists say only a tiny percentage of sexual assault victims see justice.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was also facing an internal outcry within the ruling party's ranks over her perceived inaction, before her government approved the capital punishment proposal at a meeting in Dhaka.

Justice minister Anisul Huq told AFP the law would be put into effect by the President on Tuesday.

Previously, the maximum punishment for rape was life imprisonment.

National anger over the issue has been simmering since last month, when members of the ruling party's student wing were arrested and charged in a separate gang rape case.

Protesters in the capital Dhaka and elsewhere have demanded stiffer punishments for rape, faster trials for rapists and an end to what they see as a culture of impunity.

Some have also called for Hasina's resignation, an unusual show of public defiance in a country where open criticism of the Premier has become increasingly rare.

Rallies continued on Monday in central Dhaka despite heavy monsoon rains, with hundreds of people condemning the recent arrest of student leaders by authorities attempting to suppress the protests.

40,2020/10/13,"Protesters knock down Roosevelt, Lincoln statues in Portland","After toppling the statues, the crowd smashed windows at the Oregon Historical Society and later moved onto the Portland State University Campus Public Safety office.

Protesters in Portland overturned statues of former Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln and vandalised the Oregon Historical Society in a declaration of rage toward Columbus Day.

Protest organisers dubbed the event “Indigenous Peoples Day of Rage, in response to Monday’s federal holiday named after 15th-century Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, a polarising figure who Native American advocates have said spurred centuries of genocide against indigenous populations in the Americas.

The group on Sunday night threw chains around Roosevelt’s statue, officially titled “Theodore Roosevelt, Rough Rider.” They splashed red paint on the monument and used a blowtorch on the statue’s base, news outlets reported.

The statue was pulled down by the crowd just before 9 p.m. The group later turned their attention toward Lincoln’s statue, pulling it down about eight minutes later.

Historians have said Roosevelt expressed hostility toward Native Americans, once saying: I don’t go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every 10 are...

Protesters spray-painted Dakota 38 on the base of Lincoln’s statue, referencing the 38 Dakota men Lincoln approved to have hanged after the men were involved in a violent conflict with white settlers in Minnesota.

After toppling the statues, the crowd smashed windows at the Oregon Historical Society and later moved onto the Portland State University Campus Public Safety office.

A quilt sewn by 15 Black women from Portland in the mid-1970s was among the items damaged, Oregon Historical Society executive director Kerry Tymchuk said on Monday in a statement.

Each square of the Afro-American Heritage Bicentennial Commemorative Quilt honours a Black individual or moment in history. The quilt that had been given to the museum for safekeeping was found a few blocks away and will be assessed for damage, Mr. Tymchuk said.

“As we clean up broken glass, scrub paint, and make plans to ensure safety in our building, we also, as always, welcome critique of our work,” Mr. Tymchuk wrote. “We would be grateful to have constructive feedback from all those who are willing and able to aid OHS in fulfilling our vision of an Oregon story that is meaningful to all Oregonians.” Three people were arrested by police who said in a statement that multiple businesses were damaged, including a restaurant that had at least two bullets fired through its front windows.

41,2020/10/13,Donald Trump tests negative for COVID-19 as he resumes campaigning in Florida,"Democratic rival Joe Biden also tested negative for COVID-19 on October 12, his campaign said in a statement

President Donald Trump has tested negative for COVID-19 on consecutive days and is not infectious to others, the White House physician said on October 12, as Mr. Trump headed to Florida for his first campaign rally since he disclosed he contracted the virus.

“I can share with you that he tested negative, on consecutive days, using the Abbot BinaxNOW antigen card,” White House physician Sean Conley said.

The doctor said the negative determination had taken into account a number of measurements, and not just the rapid test alone.

Antigen tests are less sensitive than the more traditional PCR diagnostic test to low levels of virus.

Dr. Conley, who does not specify the days on which the tests were performed, nevertheless added that the data allowed the medical team to conclude “that the President is not infectious to others.”

Mr. Trump's evening rally at an airport in Sanford, Florida, will kick off a three-week sprint to Election Day as new polls show him losing more ground to Democratic rival Joe Biden in two battleground states that could decide the Nov. 3 contest.

The President's negative COVID-19 tests were the first announced by the White House since Mr. Trump, who spent three days in a military hospital, said on Oct. 2 that he contracted the virus. In a memo, Dr. Sean Conley said the tests and other clinical and laboratory data “indicate a lack of detectable viral replication”.

Mr. Biden also tested negative for COVID-19 on October 12, his campaign said in a statement. The former Vice-President has tested negative a number of times since Mr. Trump announced his positive test.

Mr. Trump, 74, is seeking to change the dynamics of a race that national opinion polls and some state polls show he is losing to Mr. Biden, who is 77.

Mr. Biden pulled further ahead in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, building momentum in two states that Mr. Trump carried in the 2016 presidential election, Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls showed on October 12.

The polls, conducted on Tuesday through Sunday, showed Mr. Biden now leading Mr. Trump by 7 percentage points in both states.

Taking advantage of his momentum and growing advantage in the polls, Mr. Biden on October 12 campaigned in Ohio, where he was once considered a long shot, as he tries to expand his reach into Republican-leaning states.

Also read: Brawling in Cleveland: On Trump-Biden debate

Speaking to unionized auto workers in Toledo, Mr. Biden said he and former President Barack Obama played a key role in keeping the U.S. auto industry afloat during the financial crisis and recession more than a decade ago.

“Barack and I bet on you and the American worker and it paid off,” said Mr. Biden, who is hoping to undermine what polls show is Mr. Trump's greatest strength, the view among some voters that the former real estate entrepreneur is better at handling the economy.

Mr. Biden also appeared at a get-out-the-vote event in Cincinnati. It was Mr. Biden's second campaign trip in as many weeks to Ohio, which was once thought out of reach but where polls now show a competitive race.

Mr. Trump won the state by 8 percentage points four years ago and almost certainly must carry it again to win re-election. No Republican has won the White House without carrying Ohio.

For months, Mr. Trump had worked furiously to shift public attention away from the virus and his handling of the pandemic, which has infected more than 7.8 million people in the United States, killed more than 214,000 and put millions out of work.

His own illness has put the spotlight squarely on his coronavirus response during the closing stretch of the race, with the Mr. Biden campaign scaling up its attacks and stretching its campaign into states that normally lean Republican.

Florida up for grabs

Mr. Trump's rally in Florida, and planned rallies in Pennsylvania on October 13, Iowa on October 14 and North Carolina on October 15, will be watched closely to see whether the President has reshaped his campaign approach since contracting the virus.

“He has been like a racehorse who has been kept in a starting gate for too long,” Mr. Trump campaign senior adviser Steve Cortes told Fox News. “That horse is ready to gallop.”

Most recent polls in Florida, where a Mr. Trump loss would dramatically narrow his path to re-election, show Mr. Biden with a small lead. Mr. Trump won Florida in 2016 by just 1.2 percentage points.

Critics fault Mr. Trump for failing to encourage supporters at campaign events, and even White House staff, to wear protective masks and abide by social-distancing guidelines. At least 11 close Mr. Trump aides have tested positive for the coronavirus.

Mr. Trump told Fox News on October 11 he felt good and, without producing evidence, that he was now immune, an assertion that drew a flag from Twitter for violating the social media platform's rules about misleading information related to COVID-19.

The scientific research has been inconclusive on how long people who have recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies and are protected from a second infection.

Reliance Jio continues to remain the fastest mobile network with an average download speed of 19.3 megabit per second (mbps), while Vodafone recorded the highest speed in terms of upload in September, according to the latest data from telecom regulator Trai.

Idea Cellular network (now Vodafone Idea) followed Jio with a download speed of 8.6 mbps, Vodafone 7.9 mbps and Bharti Airtel 7.5 mbps, according to the Trai data updated on October 10.

Though Vodafone and Idea have merged their mobile businesses, Trai measured their performance separately as the integration of networks of both the companies is currently on.

The report comes following a study, across 49 cities, released by private firm OpenSignal in September declaring Bharti Airtel to have the fastest download speed in India.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) computed average network speed from data collected at pan-India level with the help of its MySpeed application on a real-time basis.

The average speed of all private telecom operators increased in September compared to the data recorded in August, according to the Trai chart.

Download speed on the Reliance Jio network increased by 21% in September to 19.3 mbps from 15.9 mbps in August, 7% on Airtel network to 7.5 mbps from 7 mbps, and 1-3% on the network of Vodafone and Idea.

The download speed helps in accessing content from various applications, while upload speed helps in sharing of content like photos and videos by subscribers.

A day after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) expelled as many as nine party leaders for contesting on a Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) ticket against official National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidates in the upcoming Bihar Assembly poll, State president Basistha Narayan Singh of the ruling alliance partner Janata Dal-United (JD-U) expelled 15 leaders from the party for six years for their “anti-party activities”.

The expelled JD(U) leaders are: Dadan Singh Pehalwan, Rameshwar Paswan, Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha, Ranvijay Singh, Sumit Kumar Singh, Kanchan Kumari Gupta, Pramod Singh Chandravanshi, Arun Kumar, Tajmul Khan, Amaresh Chaudhury, Shiv Shankar Chaudhury, Sindhu Paswan, Rakesh Ranjan, Mungeri Paswan and Kartar Singh Yadav.

“The party has acted upon them for their anti-party activities...some of them are also in the fray to contest the Assembly election against official NDA candidates,” said a JD(U) leader.

On Monday, the BJP expelled nine of its party leaders for six years for contesting the Assembly poll on an LJP ticket against JD(U) candidates. The BJP had also threatened its former leaders to not use Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pictures in their poll campaign. “We would request Election Commission to take action against them if they would be using PM Modi’s pictures in their poll campaign,” State BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal said.

Some of the expelled BJP and JD(U) leaders are said to be in strong position to win in their respective constituencies.

44,2020/10/13,"Bihar Assembly elections | Snubbed by RJD-Congress, NCP to go it alone in Bihar polls","The RJD and the Congress have not ceded a single seat to us this time despite talks, says NCP leader Praful Patel

The NCP will contest the Bihar Assembly polls independently after it was not allotted any seat by the RJD-Congress alliance with which it wanted to tie- up in the State, senior party leader Praful Patel said on Tuesday.

Mr. Patel said the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) was ready to go with the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ (mega alliance) of the RJD-Congress in the eastern state, but it was not ceded a single seat by the opposition combine.

He said it is not possible for the NCP to join forces with its ally in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena, for the October-November polls as its workers from Bihar are for contesting the election independently.

Besides the Shiv Sena, the Sharad Pawar-led party is also an ally of the Congress in Maharashtra.

We had been with them (RJD-Congress) previously too.

Yet, the RJD and the Congress have not ceded a single seat to us this time despite talks.

“Hence, the NCP will contest the polls independently, the former Union minister said.

Mr. Patel said he had discussed the tie-up issue with Congress leaders Ahmed Patel, Shaktisinh Gohil and RJDs Tejashwi Yadav, who is the face of the opposition alliance.

Yet, the Congress did not find it right to leave some seats for the NCP, he said.

The former Union minister said the NCP had demanded only five seats, out of the total 243, as part of the possible understanding among the parties.

On one hand, they say all should come together to face the BJP-JD(U) (in Bihar). But on the other, they do not give importance to other parties.

“This position of theirs is very unfortunate, Mr. Patel said, hitting out at the opposition alliance.

The NCP leader said ‘Mahagathbandhan’ parties should not blame others if they suffer losses in the polls.

He said it is not possible for the NCP to join forces with the Shiv Sena for the Bihar polls.

Our local workers are of the view of contesting the polls independently. Hence, we will not reach any understanding with the Shiv Sena in Bihar, Patel added.

The NCP has not yet announced how many Assembly seats it will contest in Bihar.

However, the party has already announced a list of 40 star campaigners for the three-phase Bihar polls to be held on October 28, November 3 and November 7.

45,2020/10/13,Bihar Assembly elections | Former Bihar BJP leaders blame senior State party leaders for rebellion,"The matter has further complicated an already complicated caste pitch in the State, and may lead to a face-off the party did not ask for

Rebel Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidates fighting on a Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) ticket in the Bihar Assembly polls blame senior leaders in the BJP for their rebellion and their seeking of tickets from other parties to contest, stating that the BJP in the State was being “pawned” to the Janata Dal-United (JD-U).

The expulsion had been threatened by senior leaders once it had become clear that the LJP would be fighting separately from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and was being approached by BJP candidates whose Assembly seats had gone to the JD(U) in the NDA seat distribution. Senior BJP leaders like Rajendra Singh, Usha Vidyarthi and Rameshwar Chaurasia moved to the LJP and on Monday, they along with six others, were expelled from the party.

Speaking to The Hindu over the telephone, Mr. Chaurasia, who is fighting from Sasaram on an LJP ticket, said that he doesn’t hold a grudge against the party as such but only towards certain leaders. “It is an open secret that there are certain leaders in the BJP who have pawned the party (party ‘ko girwi rakha ha’) to Nitish Kumar as it suits them. All the people who have sought tickets from the LJP have done so as those seats, despite being our traditional stronghold, were given away to the JD(U) in the seat distribution,” he said. While Mr. Chaurasia said he was referring to Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi as one such leader, “there are others who are with him,” he added. He also said that the BJP’s threat to go to the Election Commission (EC) if the LJP candidates used the image of Prime Minister Modi in their posters was “silly”. “We will follow EC guidelines on all these issues. Besides, Prime Minister Modi belongs to all,” he said.

Mr. Chaurasia and Mr. Rajendra Singh were surprise rebels as both have been rooted in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-BJP organisation in the State for years, with the former also being given charge of the Kashi and Kanpur sambhag (division) during the 2014 general elections, reporting directly to then BJP general secretary in charge of U.P., Amit Shah. Mr. Chaurasia, along with Union Minister Giriraj Singh, were also among those who regularly celebrated the birthday of then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi in Patna, in defiance of Nitish Kumar, who had managed to persuade the BJP to not allow Mr. Modi to campaign in successive Assembly polls in Bihar while in alliance with the party.

The expulsion, indeed the seeking of LJP tickets, once more focuses attention on the two streams of thought within Bihar BJP — one, which is comfortable with the alliance with the JD(U), where despite the BJP having a better strike rate in terms of electoral victories vis a vis seats fought, the JD(U) is given a larger share of tickets; and the second stream that has protested this ‘big brother attitude’ of the JD(U). Despite the fact that both the parties are more or less fighting on an equal number of seats this time around, ceding of specific seats has led to this rebellion, with the rebels stating that their less than cosy equations with certain Bihar BJP leaders has led to the deliberate ceding of these seats.

The LJP’s decision to part ways with the NDA while remaining friendly with the BJP and fighting polls only in seats where the JD(U) is contesting was expected to help the BJP. The anger of the JD(U) at this supposed ploy, and the BJP’s determination to pacify its ally, has meant disciplinary action against the rebels. The matter has further complicated an already complicated caste pitch in the State. Senior BJP leaders admit that while Mr. Chaurasia may yet lose the polls, while others, like Mr. Singh and Anil Kumar fighting on an LJP ticket from Vikram, may win. Post-poll, the BJP may have to pay attention to whoever is left standing in this, a wholly unasked for face-off.",,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/9rldty/article32797510.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIHAR-campaign,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/former-bihar-bjp-leaders-blame-senior-state-party-leaders-for-rebellion/article32844122.ece
46,2020/10/13,"Bihar Assembly elections | Only goal to serve people, says Nitish Kumar","JD(U) chief slams rule by Lalu Prasad at virtual rally

While addressing a virtual rally for the second consecutive day for 13 Assembly constituencies in four districts, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday said he has no other interests in life except “service to people” and sought support from voters for yet another chance to “serve them”.

Making an oblique reference to RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi, Mr Kumar also took dig at the previous 15-years regime of pati-patni (husband-wife) and appealed people to “judge who did what for the development of the State when given a chance to swerve them”.

“I’ve no personal desire but to serve people…However, for some people their family is priority…for me whole Bihar is my family…service to people is my religion,” said Mr. Kumar while addressing a virtual rally for 13 constituencies in four districts. On Monday too, he had addressed a similar virtual rally for 11 constituencies and had said the same thing which he repeated on Tuesday

“If given a chance now I want to make saksham Bihar, swawlambi Bihar (capable Bihar, self-reliant Bihar) and along with NDA again we’ll work for the development of Bihar. But some people keep criticising me on their advisors for publicity but I don’t seek any publicity for my work,” said Mr. Kumar in nearly an hour address of his virtual rally.

However, from Wednesday Mr Kumar will be addressing physical rallies too while, addressing a virtual rally in the evenings. On Wednesday he would be addressing physical rallies at Amarpur, Sultanganj, Tarapur and Mokama while, returning back to Patna to address another virtual rally in the evening. From Mokama, the JD(U) has fielded a farmer Rajeev Lochan Narayan Singh against RJD candidate and bahubali (strongman)-turned-politician Anant Singh. Mr Singh is currently in jail.

Mr. Kumar also reiterated his focus on part-2 of his ambitious Saat Nischay (seven resolves) programme and said if people of the State gave him another chance to serve them, he would the programme not only for development but also to review the work done by his government.

“I will also construct multi-storied buildings in cities for poor people and shelter homes for old persons,” the Chief Minister promised.

Talking about his government’s work for the welfare of migrant workers who returned to the State during the prolonged lockdown, Mr Kumar said, “Nearly 22 lakh people had come to the State by train only and over 15 lakh of them were put in the quarantine centres set-up by the government…We spent ₹5,300 on each of them,” he claimed.

Mr Kumar also said that on national crime index Bihar today is placed at number 23 among the States. “But what was the condition when the pati-patni government was in power? People were apprehensive about coming out of their home after dusk.”

The JD(U) chief urged older people to “tell people of this generation about all this…Even those who have benefited from several welfare schemes of this government should come forward and apprise people about the difference.”

Highlighting the marked improvement in the government hospitals, Mr Kumar said, “Earlier only 39 people were visiting Primary Health Centers (PHC) in a month but now over 10,000 people are visiting them for medical assistance... If this is not development, then what it is?”

Meanwhile, RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav, older son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, filed his nomination papers from Hasanpur while his younger brother Tejashwi Yadav addressed a rally in support. Tej Pratap Yadav has switched from Mahua in Vaishali to Hasanpur in neighbouring Samastipur district.

47,2020/10/13,Bihar Assemblt elections | Congress denies dropping key Bihar leaders from poll list,"It follows a news alert, now deleted by AIR, said BPCC chief, CLP leader and an ex-Union Minister were dropped from screening panel due to charges of irregularities.

The Congress on Tuesday issued a strong denial that senior leaders from Bihar have been dropped from a panel that is selecting candidates for the coming Assembly polls after complaints of ‘irregularities’ in ticket distribution.

The episode, however, brought into focus the Congress’s Bihar fault lines out in the open, prompting former party chief Rahul Gandhi to intervene.

There was a news alert on twitter (now deleted) by the All India Radio (AIR) that Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha, Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Sadanand Singh and former Union Minister Akhilesh Prasad Singh have been dropped from the party's Screening Committee following charges of irregularities.

“@INCIndia party is in complete denial of the news. It is very unfortunate that, a credible and responsible organization like @airnewsalerts have given out this misguiding information without even verifying with the authorities at AICC”, Avinash Pande, chairman of the Congress Screening Committee, tweeted.

He said the leaders mentioned in this post by @airnewsalerts were respectable and active members, who were seriously involved in the proceedings of screening for #BiharElections”.

Irrespective of such claims, last Sunday, party chief Sonia Gandhi ‘s announcement of key election panels to oversee the party’s election campaign, right in the middle of the poll campaign, was a clear indication that of the State unit being sidelined.

Party general secretary Randeep Surjewala, a close aide of Mr. Gandhi, has being made in-charge of the Election Management and Coordination Committee that includes prominent leaders like Meira Kumar, Shakeel Ahmed, Tariq Anwar, Kirti Azad, Shatrughan Sinha and Nikhil Kumar.

Neither Mr. Jha, , Mr. Sadanand Singh and Mr. Akhilesh Prasad Singh were made part of any of these panels.

‘Irregularities’ charges

Following the first list that included several new comers from the Janata Dal (United) (JD-U) and the BJP, there were allegations of “irregularities” by party old-timers. There were also objections about certain candidates having serious charges, including crimes against women.

Of the 70 seats that the Congress is contesting in alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the party has managed to declare only 21 seats.

To add to the confusion, the party's central election committee, headed by Ms. Gandhi, postponed its Monday meeting to Wednesday to clear the list for the remaining 49 seats.

A senior leader, however, said the delay was because of last minute differences that have cropped up between the RJD and the Congress over 7-9 seats.

“The central election committee is meeting tomorrow and we are hopeful of clearing most of the pending seats,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/408uvl/article32848194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INCjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/congress-denies-dropping-key-bihar-leaders-from-poll-list/article32842388.ece
48,2020/10/13,Bihar Assembly elections | BJP expels 9 party leaders contesting polls on LJP ticket,"They were all ticket hopefuls to contest the election under NDA

The Bharatiya Janata Party late on Monday night expelled nine of its party leaders who have filed their nominations for the Assembly elections on the Lok Janshakti Party ticket, on disciplinary grounds.

State president Sanjay Jaiswal expelled them for six years for their anti-party activities.

“You all are contesting the elections against NDA candidates and it tarnishes not only NDA’s impression but of party as well and this is against party’s discipline…so, for anti-party activities you all are expelled from the party for six years,” said the letter issued by Mr. Jaiswal.

The leaders are Rajendra Singh , Usha Vidyarthi, Rameshwar Chaurasia, Mrinal Shekhar, Ravindra Yadav, Shweta Singh, Indu Kashyap, Anil Kumar and Ajay Pratap. They were ticket hopefuls to contest the poll but under NDA coalition.

Mr. Rajendra Singh, who was associated with the RSS for a long time, even had contested the 2015 Assembly elections on the BJP ticket from Dinara in Rohtas but had lost to JD(U)’s Jai Kumar Singh by a thin margin. Later, Mr. Jai Kumar Singh was made Minister in Nitish Kumar’s cabinet.

At that time, Mr. Rajendra Singh’s name was also doing the rounds in political circles as BJP’s chief ministerial candidate. But this time the constituency seat fell into JD(U) quota and Mr. Singh decided to contest the poll on the LJP ticket.

The LJP had declared that it would contest the polls against the JD(U) but not the BJP. Names of all these nine BJP leaders had figured in the list of the LJP.

The BJP was apparently embarrassed. The JD(U) is an alliance partner of the BJP for long and they are contesting the polls jointly.

Earlier, the BJP leaders had categorically announced that those who would contest the poll against the NDA candidates would not be part of it and they could not use Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pictures in poll campaign.

“We would also request the Election Commission to take action against those using PM Modi’s pictures except NDA candidates,” Mr. Jaiswal said.

Under the NDA coalition, the JD(U) is contesting 122 and the BJP 121 seats. The JD(U) has accommodated former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi led-Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) by giving seven seats and the BJP has spared 11 seats to another alliance partner Mukesh Sahni-led Vikasheel Insaan Party.

The three-phase elections for the 243 seats will be held on October 28, November 3 and 7. The counting will take place on November 10.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ryblqr/article32839039.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-LT-SANJAYJAISWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bjp-expels-9-party-leaders-contesting-bihar-polls-on-ljp-ticket/article32839040.ece
49,2020/10/13,"Bihar Assembly election: 52,000 opt for postal ballot in phase 1 polls: EC","More than 52,000 voters, either senior citizens above 80 or people with disabilities, have opted for postal ballot in the first phase of Bihar elections to be held on October 28, the Election Commission said on Monday.

Booth Level Officers (BLO) in 71 constituencies spread across 16 districts had approached over four lakh voters of the two categories. More than 52,000 opted for postal ballots in phase one, the EC said in a statement.

They will be given postal ballots on a pre-informed date by the returning officers concerned. Security and videography arrangements will be made to ensure secrecy, safety, and transparency.

The exercise will continue in the subsequent two phases and in by-elections in other States, so that the electoral process becomes more accessible, inclusive and safe for these categories of voters against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the poll panel said.

An official explained that this postal ballot facility is different from the one extended to service voters. Here, those willing to use the facility have to fill up a form. Officials then carry the ballot to the residence of such voters and videograph the voting to ensure transparency.

50,2020/10/13,Hari Kondabolu : ‘Politically Re-Active’ will not be short on material this US election!,"Co-creator Hari Kondabolu delves into the revival of their in-demand podcast after three years, why Donald Trump is ‘not a typical candidate’, and how being a new parent has affected his world view

The last time Hari Kondabolu was in Hyderabad, he fell in love with Irani chai. “They were some of the most delicious drinks I had in my life,” he laughs, “Especially the ones at the iconic older places in the city.” From a time of constant travel, the actor-comedian-podcaster is now creating content in a house-bound setting.

Over a video call from California, the 37-year-old says he and long-time friend W Kamau Bell are closely watching the US political landscape as the 2020 Presidential election campaigns and debates roll on.

Hari is co-creating content for the third season of Politically Re-Active (Topic Studios). The new season comes three years after the previous one, and for both Kamau and Hari, the timing and urgency called for a revival. The three-year absence did not go unnoticed; many fans of Hari and Kamau continually asked when they would return. Hari mentions that Kamau, who has won an Emmy for United Shades of America, was asked more about the podcast than about his television show, so “it’s clear people resonated with the podcast.”

The podcast, which kicked off in 2016, is not just another political science satire show. The second season’s episode on gerrymandering has been implemented in many US schools’ curriculum for its relevance and easy-to-understand approach to a complex topic. Hari looks back, “On a level, maybe we didn’t anticipate the ratings to be really good and that was cool.”

The early episodes certainly have stick, in that people are still listening to them, three years on, given they feature personalities such as Hasan Minhaj, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Van Jones, Lewis Black, Akilah Hughes and more.

The reason we went off the air, to begin with was, it was a well-done podcast; but that takes time and effort, tons of research, preparation and editing. Even with producers, we were doing some heavy lifting.” So season two came to a close, but Hari and Kamau stayed in touch: Kamau started United Shades of America and Hari released The Problem With Apu in November 2017, a documentary about Apu from The Simpsons.

Newfound urgencies

Then in 2020, COVID-19 struck; the world came to a stand-still and Kamau and Hari found their schedules to be more free. The third season was based “on a gradual acceptance that this was a popular thing that people loved, and on finding time to do it during an important election year.”

According to Hari, Trump is “not a typical candidate.” He elaborates, “Trump has been able to exploit cracks in the Constitution and the system. We can talk about what he’s done with immigration but we have a system that allows him to make choices; and we’re supposed to have a system of checks and balances but the fact that this man was not checked, tells you about that system.”

The third season launched with the first official episode on October 8. Episodes of Politically Re-Active are hot-off-the-mic, with Hari and Kamau recording weekly from their respective homes. Hari recalls recording the first episode, “Trump had just been tested positive for COVID-19 — so the chaos we are in now is certainly different than the chaos of pre-election. It is extreme now.” Certainly, this is like no other process largely due to the pandemic, explaining the way people are voting is changing, and how the debates look.

Seasoned guests for season 3 include: Jon Lovett, former Obama speechwriter and co-host of Pod Save America

Cori Bush, a nurse and Black Lives Matter activist poised to be Missouri’s first black Congresswoman

Alexandra Rojas of Justice Democrats

Desmond Meade, who led the movement to get the vote for disenfranchised ex-felons in Florida

Actor-comedian-filmmaker Ilana Glazer (Broad City) who is working to empower young voters to participate in elections

To add value to the third season, Hari and Kamau will bring in a variety of political experts and activists, with whom they had engaged through their years in the industry. “It was a multi-fold process; we thought about who we would like to talk to in general — somebody with personality, is interesting and is engaged in political thinking or work.”

The newfound timeliness also comes from Hari becoming a new parent over the last month, and Kamau being a father of three.“There’s a degree of thinking about where this [country] is going, and what we have to look forward to. We think about systems and larger institutional things and we always have more than whatever the topic of the week is, so it’s important to keep the eyes on the prize.”

Though Hari’s new son is only a month old, parenthood has given him some new perspective. “In my most cynical times, when I think about the end of the world through environmental disaster or nuclear annihilation [laughs] there is this really dark part of me that thinks to myself ‘well, at least it’s done, human suffering is over because humanity’s over — it’ll be over with.’ [laughs]. I can’t have that thinking with a kid, right? I’m certainly thinking more about the future in that we must salvage things to create a future that’s livable. Optimism is valuable when you have a kid; you’re working towards their growth and for that to work, you have to value said future.”

Pulling it together

The episodes are meaty, each about an hour-long and there have been some challenges, he admits, chief among them being the global lockdown. “There is a general disconnect from people this year,” he says. “ Earlier when we did the podcast, the guest would be with me or Kamau, but this year, that is not there. I hate that everything is so distant, there isn’t a human connection!”

One of the most remarkable differences within the house-bound settings is that Hari and Kamau may not be as out and about; for the time being, their portal to the elections is largely screen-oriented. The Vice Presidential Debate on October 8 saw Hari and Kamau live-tweeting real-time responses and observations as a form of communication, and also, interestingly, some zen, “Both of us, being comedians, the instinct with these live events is to tweet, to find perspectives and jokes as a way to deal with the absurdity of it. We’re not going to short on material this election!”

But podcasts possess an inherent intimacy for both listener and creator, agrees Hari. “I love that we are learning with the listener, it’s more genuine when the audience knows it, too, because they seem themselves in you. I would rather be in that position than in a position of ‘preachiness’.”

54,2020/10/13,"Wipro net dips 3%, to buy back ₹9,500-cr of shares","Higher tax, lower income nips profit

IT services firm Wipro Ltd. on Tuesday announced a share buy-back proposal worth ₹9,500 crore even as the second-quarter net profit dipped 3% to ₹2,484 crore on higher taxation and lower other income.

The company has fixed the buy-back price at ₹400 an equity share, Wipro said.

This is the firm’s fourth buy-back exercise, the previous occasions being 2019 ($1.7 billion), 2017 (₹11,000 crore) and 2016 (₹2,500 crore).

“The net profit is lower owing to a higher effective tax rate and lower other income as we completed a large buy-back in September,’’ said CFO Jatin Dalal.

Meanwhile, consolidated revenue dipped 0.1% to ₹15,115 crore from the year-earlier period. The consolidated IT services revenue stood at ₹14,768 crore.

“Wipro had a good quarter with growth [q-o-q] in revenue, expansion of margins, lower employee turnover and solid growth of operating cash flows,” said CEO Thierry Delaporte.

The revenue growth of 3.7% in reported terms and 2% in constant currency terms was broad-based and led by a robust pick up in volumes, he added.

‘IOT, 5G to drive wave’

He further said, “The context for our customers has changed enormously through the pandemic.

“While the traditional IT services will continue to be essential, the next big wave of opportunity will be driven by next generation services of cloud, digital transformation, IOT and 5G.’’

Wipro has set its priorities as gowth, sales, offerings, talent and simplification of operating model.

Wipro expects revenue from its IT services business to be in the range of $2,022 million to $2,062 million. This would mean a sequential growth of 1.5% to 3.5%.

Wipro also said it would hand out promotions to high performers in December. Some 80% of the staff would be covered under this year’s promotion plan.

Firm to buy Eximius

Wipro has also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire U.S.-based Eximius Design, an engineering services company with expertise in semiconductor, software and systems design, for $80 million.

Wipro has made three small acquisitions after Mr. Delaporte took over in July. “We want to play a key role in M&As. We will be active and do acquisitions in areas that we consider as strategic and size will not be a limit for us,” he said.

“Wipro’s revenue, though not stellar, are strong given the present circumstances,” said Hansa Iyengar, senior analyst, Ovum, a U.K.-based research firm. “Wipro needs to continue sharpening its focus on the services and technologies that can carry it through the next decade and beyond namely IoT, 5G/Edge, AI/ML and cybersecurity,” she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/kwh27l/article32847430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBUWIPRO,https://www.thehindu.com/business/wipro-net-dips-3-to-buy-back-9500-cr-of-shares/article32847433.ece

56,2020/10/13,Centre allows additional borrowing by 20 States,"States can together raise ₹68,825 cr.

A day after the GST Council failed to arrive at a consensus on the mode of borrowings to meet compensation shortfalls facing the States, the Finance Ministry permitted 20 States, including Maharashtra, to raise ₹68,825 crore through open market borrowings.

These 20 States, the expenditure department said, had conveyed their acceptance of the first borrowing option offered by the Centre to meet GST compensation shortfalls.

Under this, States could borrow ₹1.1 lakh crore from the market with principal and interest payments to be paid out of GST cess collections whose levy has been extended beyond 2022.

While all BJP-ruled States had acceded to this option, several opposition-ruled States had sought that the Centre borrow from the market and pay them.

57,2020/10/13,COVID-19-specific health policies to get longer run,"IRDAI permits their renewal, migration and portability

Insurance regulator IRDAI has allowed renewal, migration and portability of standard COVID-19 specific health policies Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak.

Giving insurers, and by extension policyholders, the choice to renew, migrate and port the policies, the regulator said Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak of any tenure can be renewed for further terms of 3.5 months, 6.5 months or 9.5 months. The policies can be renewed till March 31 and the renewal has to be done before expiry of the existing contract for ensuring coverage is continued seamlessly. The regulator also advised insurers against imposing additional waiting period of 15 days on renewal.

At the time of renewal, policyholders can change the sum insured, but there will be a waiting period for the enhanced portion.

IRDAI said insurers can migrate Corona Kavach individual policies to any other indemnity based health insurance product as desired by the policyholder. In case of Corona Kavach Group policies, it gave insurers a choice to provide migration to any other individual indemnity based health policy at the point of exit from the group policy or cessation of coverage of the underlying group policy.

The waiting period served in the existing Corona Kavach policy (individual/group) has to be protected in respect of coverage for COVID-19 in the migrated policy by the insurers, the regulator said in a circular.

The regulator also said general and health Insurers are permitted to allow portability of Corona Kavach (individual) policy from one insurer to another.

The decision of the IRDAI is not completely unexpected as its senior officials had hinted at such a move in the wake of the raging pandemic and initial popularity of the product. In a little over month of the launch, on July 10, around 7.5 lakh Corona Kavach policies were sold, about 12.86 lakh people covered and ₹215 crore premium was collected, IRDAI Member (Non-Life) T. L. Alamelu had told a meeting.

Gurdeep Singh Batra, head, Retail Underwriting at Bajaj Allianz General Insurance said the norms on renewal, portability and migration of the COVID-19 specific policies were “a welcome move as the COVID-19 vaccine is yet to come out.”

“With this development, as insurers we will work towards safeguarding policyholders against the COVID-19 health risks. However, at the same time we would prefer that such insuring population eventually opts for comprehensive health insurance policies,” he said.

Health Business Head of Policybazaar.com Amit Chhabra said with the norms, those who were not able to buy a plan with a higher sum insured initially can now enhance the sum insured in case they feel the treatment cost might go up.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fljkww/article32847365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBUVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/covid-19-specific-health-policies-to-get-longer-run/article32847366.ece
58,2020/10/13,‘Centre may provide further stimulus’,"Indications are there could be more, over and above Monday’s mini-stimulus package from the FM

The government could announce more relief and stimulus measures to pump-prime the economy in the months to come, with senior government sources stressing that the mini-stimulus package announced on Monday did not mean that the Centre had closed the option for more steps going forward.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a package on Monday to spur consumer demand and capital spending, with estimated benefits in the range of ₹73,000 crore to ₹1 lakh crore. The package, estimated to have a fiscal cost of 0.2% of GDP, includes incentives for government employees and formal sector employees to buy consumer goods and other services by using cash vouchers linked to their leave travel allowances.

“We are not saying that this is the last stimulus package that we are offering to counter the pandemic’s effects on the economy,” a senior government source said, in response to queries if any further measures could be expected to boost consumer demand in the upcoming festive season.

“All options are still open… we have several ideas on the table from the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, the NITI Aayog, corporate India. We are open to ideas from anybody,” the official said.

‘Vodafone appeal’

The government is yet to take a final call on moving an appeal against Vodafone’s victory in an arbitration over a long-pending tax dispute that involved a retrospective amendment to the country’s tax laws.

“We are not in favour of retrospective taxation amendments, but we also don’t believe that a tax claim can be invoked under a bilateral investment protection pact (BIPA),” another senior government source said.

“How can the sovereign right of a country to raise taxes be part of a bilateral investment pact… Those are only supposed to protect investments made by either country's firms into each other’s markets. BIPAs are about protecting investments, not avoiding taxes,” the person said, requesting anonymity owing to the sensitivity of the matter.

The merits and demerits of filing an appeal against last month’s arbitration award to Vodafone are still being evaluated, the source said. One option being considered is that no appeal may be filed in this particular case, but India’s right to tax will be asserted in an appropriate manner to pre-empt such incidences in the future.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/dktz06/article32847324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBUMOF,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-may-provide-further-stimulus/article32847325.ece

63,2020/10/13,Supreme Court dismisses plea for re-test of ICSE classes nine and 11 exams,"Cannot direct Board to follow norms specified by CBSE, it says

The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a plea to direct the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE) to conduct a re-test for students who have failed their classes nine and 11 exams.

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar dismissed the petition filed by Ojas Achyut Gupta, represented by advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, to immediately “adopt, formulate and implement” norms similar to the one issued for school-level re-test in these two classes by the (CBSE) on May 13.

The court agreed with the ICSE that its regulations do not allow re-examination or awarding grace marks.

“The question of issuing directions to the contrary does not arise,” the court said.

The court said it cannot direct the ICSE to follow the norms specified by the CBSE.

“The respondent-Board (ICSE) is free and independent to adopt its own modalities for ensuring academic standards,” the order held.

“Suffice it to observe that at this distance of time, if any direction is issued to the respondent-Board it may give rise to more students similarly placed setting up their claim for similar indulgence.

Kerala’s case graph for coronavirus (COVID-19) rose by another 8,764 cases on Tuesday, with testing covering 48,253 samples. The test positivity rate shot up to 18.16%.

Kerala’s cumulative case burden first crossed the one lakh mark on September 11, cases building up with the third wave of the epidemic from mid-May.

However, the next one lakh cases were added to cumulative cases in 21 days and on October 1, the two lakh mark was crossed, while the next one lakh cases were added in just 12 days.

The COVID-19 toll touched 1,046, with 21 more deaths added to the official list. Kozhikode counted eight deaths, while four each took place in Alapuzha and Ernakulam, three in Malappuram and one each in Kannur and Kasaragod.

Of the new cases, 8,643 (98.6%) were locally acquired infections, including among 76 healthcare workers.

65,2020/10/13,Another ‘sly’ attempt to dazzle people with exaggerated numbers: P. Chidambaram,"A candid confession that the earlier so-called ₹20-lakh cr. package was a massive failure, says ex-Finance Minister

Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Tuesday said the Narendra Modi government’s latest stimulus package was another “sly attempt” to dazzle the people with exaggerated numbers.

Using a Hindi idiom, at a virtual press conference, Mr. Chidambaram said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcements on Monday were like “digging a mountain to find a mouse” and asserted that the announcements were an admission that the ₹20-lakh crore Atma Nirbhar package was a ‘hoax’.

“The grand announcement on Monday was no stimulus package to push economic growth. It was another sly attempt to dazzle the people with exaggerated numbers and lead them to believe that the government is hands-on and responsive to their needs and the economy. It is also a candid confession that the earlier so-called ₹20-lakh crore package was a massive failure. It was a failure because it was a hoax.”

He also accused the BJP of adopting a “Maa-Baap” attitude by telling government employees how they should spend their money and on what goods and by when.

Also read: Finance Minister’s stimulus concedes failure of ₹20 lakh crore Atma Nirbhar package: Congress

“Just as the BJP has been telling people what to eat, what to wear, what language to speak, who to love, who to marry etc., it is now trying to control people on their spending preferences. This is another piece of retrograde interference in people’s lives,” he alleged.

On Monday, Ms. Sitharaman had announced cash in lieu of LTC and an advance payment of a part of wages to the Central government employees to generate consumer demand and claimed that the measures are likely to create an additional demand of ₹73,000 crore.

“The numbers claimed this time too are a hoax. The stimulus is not of a value of ₹73,000 crore. Nor is it of the value of ₹1,00,000 crore — another number that has been thrown at us. The fiscal impact of these announcements is estimated by analysts to be a mere 0.1% of the GDP,” said Mr. Chidambaram.

Reiterating the Congress demand of paying direct cash incentive to the people at the bottom of the income pyramid, he accused the Modi government of “stubbornly refusing” to listen.

“The most deserving people who need the money desperately have again been left in the cold. They are the bottom half of the families in India….I am sure they are watching the government’s pitiful efforts to revive the economy that will register a de-growth of 10% in 2020-21,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lzi9fm/article32847215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14CHIDAMBARAMNEWS3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/another-sly-attempt-to-dazzle-people-with-exaggerated-numbers-p-chidambaram/article32847239.ece
66,2020/10/13,Congress leaders hit out at trolls forcing withdrawal of Tanishq advertisement,"Congress leaders on Tuesday lashed out at trolls that stirred a controversy over a Tanishq advertisement promoting inter-faith unity and forced its withdrawal, with party leader Shashi Tharoor asking why the “bigots” do not boycott India, which has been a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity.

“So Hindutva bigots have called for a boycott of Tanishq Jewelry for highlighting Hindu-Muslim unity through this beautiful ad. If Hindu-Muslim ‘ekatvam’ irks them so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world -- India,” the MP from Thiruvananthapuram asked on Twitter.

His party colleague Anand Sharma expressed shock at the controversy triggered by the advertisement and called for protecting the country’s multi-religious and multi-ethnic cultural mosaic from hate mongers.

By creating a controversy over the advertisement, bigots have taken hatred to the extreme, he said.

“Shocked at the controversy triggered by a beautiful #tanishq ad in which a mother in law’s acceptance and love for her daughter in law has been attacked, is most distressing. The bigots have taken hate ludicrous extreme,” the former Union Minister wrote on Twitter. “Our multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-lingual cultural mosaic is the beauty and strength of India and that must be upheld and protected from hate mongers,” he added.

Congress deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi said the hate campaign against Tanishq is precisely the reason why the country needs more symbols of Hindu-Muslim unity. “We need to celebrate India and her youth who are transcending barriers of religion, gender, caste and colour. Tanishq might have given up, proud Indians will not,” he wrote on Twitter.

Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said, “Come on Tanishq. Why must you succumb to bigots? Your ad is beautiful, it celebrates diversity and love. Only a sick mind sees anything besides that. Disappointed you gave in to hate.”

Another party spokesperson, Shama Mohamed, said India Inc needs to raise its voice against the tsunami of hate unleashed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and not succumb under pressure like the Tatas did on the Tanishq advertisement.

“Our freedom fighters gave their lives for the idea of a pluralistic India. The BJP has polarised this country to the point that even the mere portrayal of Hindu-Muslim unity in the #tanishq ad has trolls up in arms. India’s pluralistic ethos is its soul, & #BJP is out to kill it,” she said in a tweet.

The Tanishq commercial on interfaith love triggered a furious backlash on social media with some accusing the jewellery brand of promoting “love jihad”, prompting the company to withdraw the film on October 13, citing hurt sentiments and the well-being of its staff.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yxxhfg/article32354723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANANDSHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-leaders-hit-out-at-trolls-forcing-withdrawal-of-tanishq-advertisement/article32847216.ece

Ms. Mufti is among the top regional leaders of J&K who advocates a joint struggle for restoration of J&K’s special status under the Gupkar Declaration, which is supported by seven regional parties, including the NC, the Peoples Conference and the Congress.

After hearing for two years, a court of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on Tuesday asked the District Judge to transfer the criminal defamation complaint of former union minister MJ Akbar against journalist Priya Ramani to another judge on the ground that the court was designated to hear cases filed against lawmakers.

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Vishal Pahuja, who had started the final arguments in the case on February 7 this year, said the case in hand is not filed against against an MP or MLA and needs to be transferred to the “Competent Court of Jurisdiction”.

Mr Pahuja said his court (court of ACMM) was designated to try the cases filed against the lawmakers by a circular passed on February 23, 2018 and since this case was not filed against MP/MLA , he was marking the matter to Principal District and Sessions Judge to consider re-assigning the case to another Metropolitan Magistrate.

Mr Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ms Ramani in March 2018.

During a hearing before a city court on Monday in connection with the corruption charges against Mr. Kumar, prosecutor Sunil Kumar Verma alleged that the official, Raghavendra Vats, punched and strangulated him on October 9. The court has summoned Mr. Vats on the next date of hearing on October 19. Mr. Verma has also filed a complaint at Lodhi Road police station.

“A fact-finding inquiry has been initiated to verify the allegation made by the public prosecutor. Preliminary findings have revealed that the DIG in question, well before October 9 when the purported incident took place, had complained against the prosecutor to the officials concerned about his behaviour,” said an agency official.

In December 2016, the CBI filed a charge sheet against Mr. Kumar, a 1989-batch Indian Administrative Service official, and nine others, alleging a loss of ₹12 crore to the exchequer in the award of contracts from 2007 to 2015.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yeaxgi/article32845657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rajendra-Kumar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-to-probe-assault-complaint-against-official/article32845638.ece
71,2020/10/13,Court remands Deepak Kochhar to ED custody till Oct. 17,"The case pertains to the deals between Videocon Group and the ICICI Bank

The Prevention Of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Tuesday remanded businessman Deepak Kochhar, husband of former Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the ICICI Bank Chanda Kochhar, to the custody of Enforcement Directorate (ED) till October 17.

Mr. Kochhar was arrested by ED on September 7 late evening on charges of money laundering. ED’s counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that on September 8, Mr. Kochhar was remanded to ED custody till September 19. However, on September 14 he tested COVID-19 positive and therefore the application of his ED custody was transmitted to judicial custody during treatment period.

Advocate Vijay Agarwal representing Mr. Kochhar argued that the court can grant police custody within 15 days from his production before the court and after expiry of said period cannot grant police custody and the only custody which can be granted is judicial custody. He said Mr. Kochhar’s police custody got over on September 23. So now the court cannot grant police custody.

Mr. Agarwal also contended that as per medical advice after testing negative and discharge from hospital, a patient requires 14 days rest. So the accused may be allowed to take such rest in private hospital in Mumbai.

Special judge Milind V Kurtadikar said, “The ED was granted custody till September 19. Meanwhile, Mr. Kochhar tested COVID positive. That time priority was given to his health issue and therefore the ED custody was suspended. While considering rights and liberty of accused, we cannot ignore that the investigation agency also gets fair opportunity for investigation. Here, he is the prime accused. In such circumstances, fair chance of investigation has to be given” and remanded Mr. Kochhar to ED custody till October 17.

The case pertains to the deals between Videocon Group and the Bank. The ED has relied upon a FIR registered by the CBI in 2019.

The FIR charged Mr. Kochhar with cheating and criminal conspiracy and for causing loss to the ICICI Bank by sanctioning loans to the Videocon Group of companies in contravention of the rules and policies of the Bank during the relevant period. These loans given to the Videocon Group of companies have turned non-performing assets and thus resulted in wrongful loss to the Bank and wrongful gain to the borrowers and accused persons.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vhf314/article32845374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEEPAKKOCHHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/court-remands-deepak-kochhar-to-ed-custody-till-oct-17/article32845375.ece
72,2020/10/13,Coronavirus | eVIN network to handle COVID-19 vaccine supply,"Meet takes stock of identification of frontline workers

The eVIN network, which can track the latest vaccine stock position; temperature at storage facility; geo-tag health centres; and maintain facility-level dashboard, is being repurposed for the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, said the Union Health Ministry in a release issued on Tuesday.

Vinod K. Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, in his presentation at the 21st meeting of the high-level Group of Ministers (GoM) on COVID-19 on Tuesday, chaired by Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, added that the listing of healthcare workers would also be complete by the end of October or early November, while the task of identifying frontline workers, recalibration of the digital platform, the logistics of non-vaccine supplies, and cold chain augmentation, are being carried out as per the detailed implementation plan.

During the meeting, he presented a comprehensive study on the priority sections of the population that would have initial access to the vaccine, drawing upon the recommendations of the Centre for Disease Control, U.S.A., and the World Health Organization, said a release issued by the Health Ministry.

Noting that the key States of Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have recently exhibited a surge in cases, the Ministry said that there is a need to closely monitor the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic here.

Speaking at the GoM meeting, Dr. Vardhan stated that India now needs to be “mindful of COVID appropriate behaviour during the forthcoming festival season and the winter months”.

“With 62,27,295 recovered cases, India has the highest recovery rate of 86.78% in the world. Fatality Rate of 1.53% is the lowest in the world. A total of 1,927 labs at present have led to an upsurge in testing. India’s testing capacity has been hiked to 1.5 million tests per day. Close to 11 lakh samples were tested in the last 24 hours,” he added.

During the meeting, Sujeet K. Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control, presented a detailed report on pandemic control in India, and said that the overall recovery rate for India is 86.36%. “Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu have the highest recovery rate of 96.25% in India, followed by Andaman & Nicobar Islands (93.98%) and Bihar (93.89%). Kerala has the lowest recovery rate of 66.31% because of the huge surge in the number of cases in recent days,” he said.

Pointing to the pattern in influenza and vector-borne diseases that peak during this season, Dr. Singh noted that the fall in cases of influenza across the country may be due under-reporting because of the ongoing pandemic. He also apprised Ministers of the advisories issued for improving testing and surveillance activities for seasonal influenza to simultaneously detect it with COVID-19 in view of the upcoming influenza season in the country.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nj4xcp/article32681464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WESTBENGAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/surge-in-cases-in-kerala-karnataka-bengal-rajasthan-chhattisgarh-health-ministry/article32845350.ece
73,2020/10/13,"Coronavirus | 70% of COVID-19 fatalities in men, says Health Ministry","Nearly 14% of COVID-19 fatalities have been reported from the 45-60 age group with co-morbidities and 1.5% without co-morbidities.

The Union Health Ministry on Tuesday cautioned those below 60-plus of age to not be reckless about COVID-19 prevention. It said that nearly 14 % of COVID-19 fatalities have been reported from the 45-60 age group with co-morbidities and 1.5% without co-morbidities.

Presenting the data at a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said 70% of COVID-19 fatalities had been reported in men and the rest in women. “We have 1% fatalities reported from the below-17 age group and the 18-25 age group.”

Across the country, the number of fatalities due to COVID-19 had been lower than 1,000 mark for 10 successive days. Seven hundred and six case fatalities have been reported in the past 24 hours. Of these, nearly 79% were concentrated in 10 States/UTs. More than 23% of new fatalities reported were from Maharashtra (165 deaths), he stated.

‘Use social vaccine’

Speaking at the press meet, Vinod K. Paul, member, NITI Aayog, urged the general public to use social vaccine against the virus till a vaccine is developed.

“The vaccine will come when it will come and till then it is essential that we maintain precautions. The pandemic is stabilising but winters are known to be conducive for the spread of viruses. Many countries are now seeing a second peak, which is worse than the first one. So we have to prevent this by wearing a mask, keeping hygiene and avoiding crowding. If we are not careful large gatherings for festivals could turn into super spreading events. Till we have a vaccine this is our only way out,’’ said Dr. Paul.

Two indigenous vaccines were in the final stage of the phase-2 trial and the results would be out soon. “On the basis of which further strategy will be devised. The third vaccine candidate [Oxford] involving the Serum Institute is undergoing the third-phase clinical trial. Results are expected in November end or so,’’ he added.

Mr. Bhushan said pricing, storage and distribution modalities for the vaccine were being worked out.

India currently had one of the lowest cases per million and reported deaths per million. While the global figure for cases/million was 4,794, India was clocking 5,199. The U.K., Russia, South Africa, the U.S. and Brazil were reporting higher numbers. The deaths/million in India were 79, while the world average was 138, he observed.

“It would be unfair to compare India with high income countries such as the U.S., the U.K., Russia, France etc. as they are not on an equal footing. This is primarily because of its population dynamics which results in a lopsided distribution of resources,’’ he pointed out.

On parameters such as of availability of doctors and nurses per million, as also the percentage of GDP spent on health, India’s comparison with the other high-income countries would present a skewed analysis. Given the larger context, India’s targeted strategies in COVID-19 management and the public health response over the last several months have resulted in encouraging outcomes, he asserted.

Consistent slide

Data released by the Ministry noted that India was reporting a consistent slide in the new confirmed cases. New cases numbering 55,342 were registered in the last 24 hours. “From the last five weeks, there is a continuous decline in the average daily new cases. The weekly average of daily new cases fell from 92,830 cases in the 2nd week of September to 70,114 cases in 2nd week of October,’’ noted the data.

It said India continued to report a trend of steadily decreasing active cases. “Presently, the active cases comprise merely 11.69% of the total positive cases of the country standing at 8,38,729. The active cases have been below the 9 lakh mark for the fifth consecutive day. Seventy six per cent of the new confirmed cases are from 10 States and UTs,’’ it stated.

Karnataka had overtaken Maharashtra with the highest number of new reported cases. “Both still are contributing more than 7,000 new cases. The States which are reporting spurt in cases are Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. New recoveries numbering 77,760 were added in the last 24 hours. With this, the total number of recoveries has crossed 62 lakh [62,27,295]. Higher number of single day recoveries is also reflected in the continuous increase in the national recovery rate, which is at present 86.78%,’’ said the Ministry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ndfyp1/article32845247.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-70-of-covid-19-fatalities-in-men-says-health-ministry/article32845248.ece
74,2020/10/13,"Ladakh standoff | After talks fail to break impasse, China blames India for tensions","Beijing points the finger at infra development, deployments by India along LAC.

A day after the marathon talks between Corps Commanders, held at Chushul in eastern Ladakh, failed to reach an agreement on disengagement, China on Tuesday said the “root cause” of the recent tensions was India’s infrastructure development and military deployments along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

China’s claim, which Indian officials have rejected previously pointing to the People’s Liberation Army's (PLA) build-up of troops, multiple transgressions and attempt to unilaterally redraw the LAC since May, underlines the difficulty that the seven rounds of military talks have faced in taking forward the stalled disengagement process and achieving a return to status quo that India has demanded.

Following the sixth round on September 21, both sides, in a joint statement, agreed to “stop sending more troops to the front line”. The build-up of troops, however, remains, and Indian officials believe the Chinese side may be preparing for the long-haul and the harsh winter to come.

The joint press release on Tuesday shed no clarity on any possible timetable for disengagement. It said both sides had at the seventh round of talks on Monday held ""a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the Line of Actual Control in the Western Sector of India-China border areas.”

“They were of the view that these discussions were positive, constructive and had enhanced understanding of each other’s positions,” the release said. “Both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement as early as possible. Both sides agreed to earnestly implement the important understandings reached by the leaders of the two countries, not to turn differences into disputes, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas.”

The release did not mention a return to status quo prior to May’s transgressions by China, a prospect that appears unlikely in light of the PLA’s entrenching of its positions in areas such as the north bank of the Pangong Tso (lake).

The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, in response to a question at a daily briefing on India unveiling new bridges as part of upgrading the border infrastructure in Ladakh and in Arunachal Pradesh, blamed India for the LAC situation, and said Beijing did not recognise the legality of Ladakh, a position Beijing took last year as it opposed the creation of the Union Territory because it included within its borders Aksai Chin, currently occupied by China.

“First, I want to make it clear that China does not recognise the Ladakh Union Territory illegally set up by the Indian side and [does not recognise] Arunachal Pradesh,” said the spokesperson, Zhao Lijian. “We stand against the development of infrastructure facilities aimed at military contention along the border area. Based on the two sides consensus, neither should take actions along the border that might escalate the situation to avoid undermining the two sides efforts to ease the situation.”

He stated, “For some time, the Indian side has been ramping up infrastructure development along the border and stepping up military deployment, which is the root cause for the tensions between the two sides. We urge the Indian side to earnestly implement our consensus and refrain from actions that might escalate the situation and take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquillity along the border.”

Extension of railway network from Tibet

China has already upgraded its border infrastructure in Tibet and Xinjiang, and enjoys an asymmetry in its favour. It is also in the process of extending its railway network in Tibet up to the border. India has been moving to speed up the construction of roads and bridges to reduce the gap.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday inaugurated 44 permanent bridges across seven States and Union Territories built by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO). He said the bridges provide improved connectivity and would meet the transport and logistics requirements of the armed forces throughout the year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dyq5yn/article32845014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LAC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ladakh-standoff-after-talks-fail-to-break-impasse-china-blames-india-for-tensions/article32845015.ece
75,2020/10/13,Permanent commission | Supreme Court annoyed at roadblocks faced by women officers,"‘Difference in thinking’ by Army bureaucracy has to be bridged, Bench observes orally

The Supreme Court expressed annoyance at the roadblocks faced by women officers on the way to permanent commission, promotion and consequential benefits, saying it showed a “difference in thinking” between the highest levels of leadership in the country and the Army bureaucracy.

“There is a different thinking that permeates the highest levels of leadership in the country and a different thinking in the bureaucracy of the Army. Bureaucracy is thinking how can these women protect the nation?... We have to bridge the gap,” Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, heading a Bench, observed orally on Tuesday.

The court was exasperated with a medical criterion by which women officers with 10 to over 20 years of service and in the age bracket of 35 to 50 years had to compete with gentlemen officers aged between 25-30 years for permanent commission.

“All these women have served the nation and are still serving. They are in saddle today. Army cannot be oblivious of the fact that after 26 years of service, they are only saying that at 52, don’t expect us to compete with men at the age of 25 and 30... If you apply the medical standards of a 25-year-old man to a woman officer who has gone through childbirth, how do we protect the rights of these officers?” Justice Chandrachud addressed Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain.

The court asked the government and the Army to take a considered decision to provide these women officers with a different standard.

“You will have to ensure that criteria that you apply for 25 and 30 year old men should not be applied to these women officers,” Justice Chandrachud told Mr. Jain.

Mr. Jain however said that a dilution of medical and physical standards for permanent commission may become a cause for disgruntlement.

But the court made it a point to observe that these women officers would have been necessarily fit had the authorities not dragged on this case for nine years in court. The Delhi High Court had allowed permanent commission to women officers way back in 2011, but the Army had come to the apex court in appeal.

The hearing was based on a batch of petitions led by Lt. Ashu Yadav, represented by advocate Chitrangda Rastravara, against the “arbitrary norms” and “inequality” faced by women officers for permanent commission.

On February 17, the Supreme Court had declared that women officers in the Short Service Commission (SSC) should be provided an equal opportunity with their male counterparts for a shot at permanent commission and promotions. The apex court verdict had dismissed views that women were physiologically weaker than men as a “sex stereotype”.

“Women officers of the Indian Army have brought laurels to the force… Their track record of service to the nation is beyond reproach. To cast aspersion on their abilities on the ground of gender is an affront not only to their dignity as women but to the dignity of the members of the Indian Army,” Justice Chandrachud had observed in that judgment. The verdict was the result of a 15-year battle by women officers for equality at workplace.

However, problems continue to plague the implementation of the judgment even after the passing of eight months.

Mr. Jain said over 600 SSC women officers were under scrutiny for grant of permanent commission.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rzuefz/article32642437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-remarks-on-roadblocks-faced-by-women-officers-en-route-permanent-commission/article32844871.ece
76,2020/10/13,"Tabassum Mansoor, the Gorakhpur-born school principal who negotiated with militants to free Indians in Libya","Head of the Indian school in Benghazi, Ms. Mansoor, led the negotiations with militants in Libya.

A team of seven Indians employed with Al Shola Al Mudea energy company in Libya got into an SUV to catch a flight from the Tripoli airport on September 13. The 800-km distance between Brega and Tripoli was risky because of the threat posed by militants. Despite precautions, the team was abducted at Asswerif and ended up as captive for almost a month and was released on October 11. A source with knowledge of the operation said the rescue would have been impossible but for Tabassum Mansoor, principal of the Indian School of Benghazi, who carried out the negotiations with the militants through various sections of Libyan authorities and tribal elders to secure the release of the men.

Also read: India welcomes release of abducted citizens in Libya

On that fateful day, Omaid, one of the seven, had called his brother-in-law Feroze Moltani in Gujarat and informed that they were all set to leave. After that there were no more calls. As Feroze and other family members of the seven Indians spent anxious days, Al Shola Al Mudea received calls from the abductors who demanded ransom to free the men. A rescue operation was tough in such a case as the conflict in Libya made normal diplomatic operations impossible. India does not have a resident Ambassador or representative in capital Tripoli and Libya is at present divided between two different governments in the east and the west.

“I can’t explain the terrible time we have been through. We had initially given up hope of seeing Omaid again. I pray to God that no one should experience so much pain as we had to endure in those first few days. But it was at that time that we found strength and support from Tabassumji. The Indian embassy in Tunis provided excellent diplomatic support but Tabassum madam handled the local negotiations to free our people,” said Feroze breaking down repeatedly over an online interview with The Hindu.

Ms. Mansoor has been in the Libyan city for more than three decades. Originally from Gorakhpur, Ms. Mansoor first came to spotlight during the 2011 evacuation of Indians from Benghazi when the city witnessed intense fighting between the forces of Muammar Qadhafi and the rebels who wanted to bring down the government. While evacuation of Indians in the west of the country was relatively easy as the facilities were still functioning in capital Tripoli, the same was not possible for Benghazi which is located in the eastern part of Libya. She mobilised the local authorities and tribal elders and around 3,000 Indians were evacuated on ships and aircraft via Malta. The energetic school teacher has seen Libya change before her and the country, despite the civil war, has treated her with great respect. Recognition also came from the Libyan government in Tripoli which made her a member of the National Education Council of Libya.

This time too Ms. Mansoor swung into action once she was entrusted with the task of coordinating the important local operatives to ensure smooth release of the seven Indians. While the Indian embassy in neighbouring Tunisia under the leadership of Ambassador Puneet Roy Kundal maintained diplomatic pressure on Tripoli by writing to the officials almost daily, Ms. Mansoor reached out to the local elders and worked her social network in and around Benghazi, 1200 km east from Tripoli. She had set up the Indian school three decades ago and over the years the school has emerged as the only English-medium educational centre in Benghazi. Apart from the main school, the Indian School network has two other branches in Benghazi that offer school education to the strife torn city. The local recognition helped the 59-year old principal as she campaigned for the safe release of the seven Indians.

Ms. Mansoor declined to speak about her role in securing the safe release of the Indians when The Hindu reached out to her. But a source who has been part of the entire process said the negotiations with the militants were highly risky as they are known to be unpredictable. As the negotiations with the kidnappers proceeded successfully, Ms. Mansoor went personally to Brega where the captors handed over the Indians. “It was a risky move as anything could go wrong with armed militants. But the Libyan authorities gave a convoy of security guards to her which boosted our confidence,” said the source from Libya.

The Libyan support to Ms. Mansoor drew appreciation from the Ministry of External Affairs which expressed “sincere thanks to the Libyan authorities and the tribal elders from the region” for the support they extended to secure the release of the men. Mr. Kundal in a social media message has announced the freed Indians will be repatriated soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/321d7/article32844227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TabassumMansoor1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tabassum-mansoor-gorakhpur-born-school-principal-who-negotiated-with-militants-to-free-indians-in-libya/article32844228.ece

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has asked all NGOs seeking foreign donations to open a designated FCRA account at the State Bank of India’s New Delhi branch by March 31, 2021.

The MHA order reiterated that NGOs registered under FCRA shall not receive any foreign donations in any other bank account from April 1, 2021.

In September, the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2020 was amended by Parliament and a new provision that makes it mandatory for all non-government organisations and associations to receive foreign funds in a designated bank account at SBI’s New Delhi branch was inserted.

An order specifying the process of opening the FCRA bank account was issued by the MHA on Tuesday. As of now there are 22,434 such NGOs and associations active under the FCRA.

The Hindu Explains | What is Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, and how does it control donations?

The order said an NGO will have to report the amount and source of foreign remittance received to the authorities.

The order said the Centre has notified the New Delhi Main Branch (NDMB) of SBI, 11 Sansad Marg, New Delhi-110001 for the purposes of opening the “FCRA account” to receive foreign contribution.

MHA said to open the account, the applicant need not visit the NDMB in Delhi and they might approach the nearest SBI branch or their SBI branch of choice.

It said that all persons/associations/NGOs who are already registered under FCRA will get sufficient time to transition to the new system and can open accounts at NDMB till March 31, 2021.

“However, all fresh applicants for certificate of registration or prior permission under the FCRA, 2010, shall have to first open the FCRA account in the NDMB to receive any foreign contribution…,” the order said.

“It is further clarified that the applicant person/NGO/ association has complete liberty to retain its present FCRA account as the another FCRA account in any branch of a scheduled bank of its choice. They can link this account with the designated FCRA account opened in NDMB, Delhi,” MHA said adding that NDMB will not levy any fee to transfer the foreign funds to the designated FCRA account.

After the Lok Sabha passed the The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020 on September 21, Opposition raised concerns that the legislation may be used to target political opponents and religious minorities.

India has the highest coronavirus (COVID-19) recovery rate of 86.78% globally with 62,27,295 recovered cases and the lowest fatality rate at 1.53%, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday.

Mr. Vardhan, who chaired the 21st meeting of the high-level Group of Ministers (GoM) on COVID-19 via video-conference in New Delhi, appealed to everyone regarding observance of COVID-19-appropriate behaviour during the forthcoming festival season and the winter months, “when the likelihood of an increase in the disease is high”, the Health Ministry said in a statement.

Coronavirus | India continues to be among countries with lowest per million COVID-19 cases, deaths

At the outset, Mr. Vardhan expressed deep gratitude and offered salutations to all the COVID-19 warriors who have been steadfastly fighting against the pandemic since many months, the Ministry said.

He continued to inform his colleagues of the sturdy public health response mounted by India in its fight against the pandemic and the encouraging results so far, it said in the statement.

With 62,27,295 recovered cases, India has the highest recovery rate of 86.78% in the world. Fatality Rate of 1.53% is the lowest in the world and the doubling time has been successfully raised to 74.9 days in the last three days, he said.

“A total of 1,927 labs at present have led to an upsurge in testing. India’s testing capacity has been hiked to 1.5 million tests per day. Close to 11 lakh samples were tested in the last 24 hours, he was quoted as saying in the statement.

“The Prime Minister has launched the countrywide Jan Andolan to encourage people to adopt and encourage COVID-appropriate behaviours to curb spread of the diseases while celebrating the festivals,” he stated.

Dr. Sujeet K Singh, Director of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), presented a detailed report on how the data-driven, graded government policies have helped India achieve significant control over the pandemic.

He showed figures related to number of cases, number of deaths, their growth rate and how they compared favourably to the world due to the aforesaid policy interventions, the statement said.

While the overall recovery rate for India is 86.36%, he informed that Dadar and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu have the highest recovery rate of 96.25% in India, followed by Andaman and Nicobar Islands (93.98%) and Bihar (93.89%).

Kerala has the lowest recovery rate of 66.31% because of the huge surge in number of cases in the recent days, the statement said.

“Pointing out the pattern of influenza and vector-borne diseases which peak during this season, he noted with concern the less reporting of cases of Influenza due to the COVID-19 pandemic across the country,” it said.

He also apprised the Ministers of the advisories issued for improving the testing and surveillance activities for seasonal influenza to simultaneously detect it with COVID-19 in view of the upcoming influenza season in the country.

Reiterating Mr. Vardhan’s concern on the fresh challenge to the containment efforts in view of the upcoming winters and festive season, he stressed on the gradual transition to mitigation in affected cities over the next few weeks and a sustained campaign to instil COVID appropriate behaviour among the people.

Through a detailed presentation, Vinod K Paul of NITI Aayog apprised the GoM of the process of COVID-19 vaccine development in India and around the world.

He presented a comprehensive study on the priority sections of the population that would have initial access to the vaccine drawing upon recommendations of Centre for Disease Control (CDC), USA and the WHO.

He also presented an age-group wise gender composition of COVID death, the percent composition of the vulnerable age-groups in the Indian population and the overlap of known COVID comorbidities amongst these age-groups, the Ministry said in the statement.

“The eVIN network which can track the latest vaccine stock position, temperature at storage facility, geo-tag health centres, and maintain facility level dashboard is being repurposed for the delivery of COVID vaccine.

Reaching out to stakeholders to allay apprehensions about the recently passed farm bills, Union Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday met policy experts, industry leaders and academicians associated with the agriculture sector, who were all praise for the new legislation.

Mr. Singh along with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has so far held a series of meetings with farmers and many others associated with the farm sector to deliberate upon the three agriculture-related bills recently passed by Parliament.

Chairman of Global Food and Retail Council Rakesh Gambhir, who was part of the delegation that met both Union Ministers, said it was a good interaction and praised the government for bringing these three bills.

“In a way these three farm bills will usher a new era of reforms in the agriculture sector and will give farmers’ independence from the clutches of the middle men and help in getting them better prices for their produce,” Mr. Gambhir told reporters after the meeting.

Echoing similar sentiments, Chairman of Punjab-based Green Valley Farms, RPS Gandhi said there are enormous benefits of the new farm-related legislation but the farmers need to be made aware and educated about it.

He said talking to the farmers in their own language is important so that there is no confusion about these three bills.

Last week, Mr. Singh had a long meeting with a delegation of award winning farmers including a Padma Shri awardee to deliberate on the government’s farm legislations.

80,2020/10/13,NGT notice to Centre on plea for quashing notification on groundwater extraction,"There was no effective mechanism to check violation by recovery of adequate compensation which was laid down by this tribunal based on expert studies, it said

The National Green Tribunal Tuesday issued notice to the Centre and the CPCB on a plea seeking quashing of a notification on groundwater extraction on the grounds that its commercial use was adversely affecting the flow of rivers and availability of drinking water in the country.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) was repeatedly issuing notification liberalising ground water extraction in water scarcity areas in spite of the need for stringent action, contrary to the very purpose for which it was setup.

There was no effective mechanism to check violation by recovery of adequate compensation which was laid down by this tribunal based on expert studies, it said.

We find that the impugned order is statutorily appealable under Section 16 (g) of the NGT Act, 2010. Thus, instead of an application, proper remedy of the appellant is an appeal. We direct conversion of the application to Appeal.

The Registry may accordingly register the matter as Appeal. We are of the view that there are arguable points which are raised in the appeal which will require reconsideration. The appeal is admitted. Issue notice to the Ministry of Jal Shakti, the bench said.

The tribunal also issued notice to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and said water is a scarce resource on which life is dependent and its extraction has to be duly regulated.

In areas where there is water scarcity, extraction can be allowed on stringent conditions of ensuring recharge, it said.

The appellant may serve notices with complete set of papers and file an affidavit of service within one week. The response may be filed within six weeks, the bench said.

The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by environmentalist Devi Das Khatri challenging the notification issued by CGWA which issued guidelines to regulate and control the ground water extraction in the country under Section 3 (3) read with Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The plea said that extraction in scarce water areas for commercial purposes was against the principle of ‘Sustainable Development’.

The applicant has pointed out that without any study of carrying capacity, the policy allows concession to micro and small enterprises drawing ground water less than 10 cubic metre per day as well as for bulk water supply.

There is no uniform policy for monitoring ground water recharge mechanism and to check the depleting ground water levels in the country, the petitioner said.

Extraction for commercial purposes was adversely affecting not only the river flow but also availability of water for drinking purposes, the plea said, adding that no effective regulatory mechanism had been set up.

According to the applicant, the impugned Notification, instead of complying with the directions of the tribunal, is in reverse direction and destructive of concept of ‘Sustainable Development’.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/8i53vt/article32798005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07DELPRIYANGT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ngt-notice-to-centre-on-plea-for-quashing-notification-on-groundwater-extraction/article32843296.ece
81,2020/10/13,"Coronavirus | India continues to be among countries with lowest per million COVID-19 cases, deaths","From the last five weeks, there has been a continuous decline in the average daily new cases.

With focussed strategies and calibrated measures, India has sustained its global position of being the country with one of the lowest COVID-19 cases per million and reported deaths per million, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday.

From the last five weeks, there has been a continuous decline in the average daily new cases.

Also read: Coronavirus | Steady surge of new cases in Maharashtra, Karnataka

“The weekly average of daily new cases fell from 92,830 cases in the 2nd week of September to 70,114 cases in the second week of October,” the ministry said.

India is reporting a consistent slide in the new confirmed cases with 55,342 fresh infections being registered in a span of 24 hours in the country.

Also read: Coronavirus India lockdown Day 201 updates | October 13, 2020

The new low in daily cases is the result of collaborative action by states and UTs under the Centre’s strategy of comprehensive and aggressive testing, prompt tracking and surveillance, hospitalization and adherence to the Standard Treatment Protocol which has ensured a standardised quality of medical care across the public and private hospitals and for home isolation, the ministry said.

While the global figure for COVID-19 cases per million is 4,794, India is clocking 5,199 infections.

The UK (8,893), Russia (8,992), South Africa (11,675), USA (23,072) and Brazil (23,911) are reporting higher numbers of cases per million, the ministry said.

The deaths/million in India are 79, while the world average is 138.

“As far tests for detection of COVID-19 are concerned, India is one of the topmost countries,” the ministry highlighted.

“With 10,73,014 tests being conducted on Monday, the cumulative number of tests done so far stand at 8.89 crore (8,89,45,107).

Higher numbers of testing on a sustained basis have aided the early identification and timely treatment which leads to higher recoveries and lower fatality rate, the ministry underlined.

“It would be unfair to compare India with high income countries such as USA, UK, Russia, France etc. as they are not on an equal footing. This is primarily because of its population dynamics which results in a lopsided distribution of resources.

“On parameters such as on the availability of doctors and nurses per million, as also the percentage of GDP spent on health, India’s comparison with the other high income countries would present a skewed analysis. Given the larger context, India’s targeted strategies in COVID-19 management and the public health response over the last several months have resulted in encouraging outcomes,” the ministry said.

India continues to report a trend of steadily decreasing active cases, the ministry underscored. Presently the active cases comprise merely 11.69% of the total COVID-19 caseload of the country standing at 8,38,729.

The active cases have been below the 9 lakh mark for the fifth consecutive day, the ministry said.

The ministry said that 76% of new cases are from 10 states and UTs. Karnataka has overtaken Maharashtra with the highest number of new reported cases. Both still are contributing more than 7,000 new cases. The States which are reporting spurt in cases are Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh.

Also, 77,760 new recoveries were added in a span of 24 hours, according to data updated at 8 am.

With this, the total number of recoveries has surged to 62,27,295.

“Higher number of single-day recoveries is also reflected in the continuous increase in the national recovery rate, which is at present 86.78 per cent,” the ministry said.

Besides, 78% of the new recovered cases are in 10 States and UTs.

Maharashtra contributes more than 15,000 to the single-day recovery followed by Karnataka with more than 12,000 recoveries.

The number of fatalities due to COVID-19 has been lower than 1000 mark for the successive days. A total 706 case fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours. Of these, nearly 79 per cent are concentrated in ten states and UTs, the ministry said.

More than 23 per cent of new fatalities reported are from Maharashtra (165 deaths).

Maharashtra contributes more than 15,000 to the single-day recovery followed by Karnataka with more than 12,000 recoveries.

India’s total COVID-19 caseload mounted to 71,75,880, with 55,342 infections being reported in a day, while death toll climbed to 1,09,856 as the virus claimed 706 lives in a span of 24 hours, the data updated at 8 am showed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sek8hj/article32842810.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-india-continues-to-be-among-countries-with-lowest-per-million-covid-19-cases-deaths/article32842811.ece

83,2020/10/13,Prashant Bhushan contempt case: Attorney General asks SC to look into media publishing material pivotal to sub judice cases,"Sensitive details of cases pending in court make their way to the media and are published on penultimate days of court hearings, threatening to injure the rights of parties, says K.K. Venugopal

Attorney General K.K. Venugopal asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to examine how sensitive details of sub judice cases (cases pending in court) made their way to the media and were published on penultimate days of court hearings, threatening to injure the rights of parties.

“When a bail application is coming up, there are conversations on TV very damaging to the accused... On the day Rafale [case] is argued, an article with documents is published. The issue of sub judice has to be contended,” Mr. Venugopal told a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar.

The submission was made while hearing a contempt case against civil rights lawyer Prashant Bhushan for comments he made about Supreme Court judges in an interview to Tehelka magazine in 2009.

But senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, for Mr. Bhushan, mildly quoted his Shakespeare at Mr. Venugopal’s views.

“When Shylock’s case is going on, can we tell the Press not to talk about it?” Mr. Dhavan said.

“If we get into the sub judice issue, we will get into Sahara judgment, which does not ban comment. Other thing is this is an extremely wide area,” Mr. Dhavan submitted.

Case shifted to Nov.

The court asked the senior lawyers to coordinate and “refine” the issues which needed to be examined. The case was shifted to November.

In September, the case came to Justice Khanwilkar’s Bench after the retirement of Justice Arun Mishra, who had headed the Bench. Justice Khanwilkar invited the Attorney General to assist the court as amicus curiae.

The contempt case against Mr. Bhushan has brought to focus pertinent questions of law, including whether a person who expresses a bona fide opinion about judicial corruption was obliged to prove it or “whether it is enough to show that he bona fide held that opinion”.

This case also involved the issue whether the suo motu powers of the Supreme Court to initiate contempt under Article 129 of the Constitution to curtail free speech and expression is restrained by the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.

Mr. Dhavan has strongly pitched for these questions to be referred to a Constitution Bench.

Also read: Contempt case statement by Prashant Bhushan issued on August 20, 2020

One of the questions also deals with the violation of due process as suo motu contempt proceedings in the Supreme Court has no provision for appeal. The court also wanted to hear arguments on laying down a procedure to be adopted if statements of judicial corruption are made in public against sitting as well as retired judges.

“Allegation of corruption per se cannot be contempt because the same pertains to criticism of a judge for a biased dispensation of justice and would in all cases require further investigation before such allegations are brushed aside at the threshold,” Mr. Bhushan had explained in his written submissions in the case.

He had said truth was a defence under Section 13 (b) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.

Mr. Bhushan said he had used the word ‘corruption’ in the interview in a wider sense to include any act of impropriety other than merely financial corruption.

“Corruption in public life has a wide and expansive definition. Corruption is not restricted to pecuniary gratification alone but various instruments identify its particular forms such as bribery, embezzlement, theft, fraud, extortion, abuse of discretion, favouritism, nepotism, clientelism, conduct creating or exploiting conflicting interests,” his written submissions had pointed out.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/h41g2y/article32842051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRASHANTBHUSHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prashant-bhushan-contempt-case-attorney-general-asks-sc-to-look-into-media-publishing-material-pivotal-to-sub-judice-cases/article32842052.ece

The provision of Aadhaar is not mandatory for the registration of births and deaths, the Registrar General of India (RGI) has clarified in a recent reply to an RTI request. If Aadhaar is provided voluntarily, it must not be printed on any document or stored in any database of births and deaths in full form, according to an RGI circular cited in the RTI response.

Visakhapatnam-based advocate M.V.S. Anil Kumar Rajagiri had filed an RTI request asking whether Aadhaar was mandatory for the registration of death or not. In its reply last week, posted on Twitter by LiveLaw, the RGI referred to an April 2019 circular to clarify that “the requirement of Aadhaar number is not mandatory for the registration of birth and death.”

It noted that registration of births and deaths was done under the Registration of Births and Deaths (RBD) Act, 1969, which was a Central law. “However, the implementation of the provisions of the said Act lies with the State/UT governments,” it added.

Supreme Court judgment

In 2017, the RGI had decreed that Aadhaar number would be required for the purpose of establishing the identity of the deceased for the purpose of death registration. However, a 2018 Supreme Court judgment changed the situation.

In its 2019 circular, the RGI noted that “the portion of Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act which enables body corporate and individual to seek authentication was held to be unconstitutional” by the Supreme Court. The RBD Act also had no provision “which permits the use of Aadhaar for establishing the identity of an individual for the purpose of registration of birth and death”, it said.

The circular was sent to the Chief Registrars of births and deaths of all States directing them to ensure that local registering authorities did not demand Aadhaar as a mandatory requirement. They could accept Aadhaar as one of the acceptable documents, if provided on a voluntary basis. However, the first eight digits of the Aadhaar number were to be masked with black ink. The full number was not to be stored in any database of births and deaths or printed on any document, added the circular.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jtquhd/article30332460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UIDAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aadhaar-not-mandatory-for-birth-death-registration-clarifies-registrar-general-of-india/article32841915.ece

Mr. Modi was speaking after releasing the autobiography of former Union Minister Balasaheb Vikhe Patil and renaming the Pravara Rural Education Society in Ahmednagar district after the Padma Bhushan recipient, via video conferencing.

Terming the farm reforms as historic, the Prime Minister said, “Today opportunities are being created to take farming and farmers from the role of annadata (food provider) to entrepreneurship.”

Referring to high milk, sugar, and wheat production in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana and Punjab, Mr. Modi said such models of local enterprise will take the country forward.

“But governments and policies did not pay attention towards profitability of farmers while being concerned about increasing productivity.

86,2020/10/13,Tanishq withdraws advertisement on inter-faith marriage following social media criticism,"Move to pull down ad draws criticism for ‘caving in’ to the ‘trolls’

Following the uproar on social media over its latest advertisement, Tanishq, the Tata Group’s jewellery brand, on Tuesday said it withdrew the advertisement “keeping in mind the hurt sentiments and well-being of our employees, partners and store staff”.

The advertisement, released ahead of the festive season, shows a baby shower being thrown by a Muslim family for their daughter-in-law, who is a Hindu. Towards the end of the video, the young woman points out to her mother-in-law that baby showers are not a tradition in their household. To which the mother-in-law replies: “Isn’t it a tradition for every home to keep daughters happy?”

The ad drew severe criticism from a section of social media users who alleged that it promoted ‘love jihad’ — a derogatory term used by fringe groups to describe interfaith relationships. The hashtag #BoycottTanishq has been trending across social media sites such as Twitter since Monday. Buckling under the pressure, Tanishq pulled down the ad. However, the brand was criticised for “bowing down” to the “trolls”.

“The idea behind the Ekatvam campaign is to celebrate the coming together of people from different walks of life, local communities and families during these challenging times and celebrate the beauty of oneness. This film has stimulated divergent and severe reactions, contrary to its very objective,” a company spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added, “We are deeply saddened with the inadvertent stirring of emotions and withdraw this film keeping in mind the hurt sentiments and well-being of our employees, partners and store staff.”

Amid the controversy, shares of Titan Company Limited, which owns the Tanishq brand, fell 2.18% or ₹27.35 per share on the BSE, to close at ₹1,229.75 per share.

Reacting on the issue, Congress MP Shahi Tharoor had tweeted, “So Hindutva bigots have called for a boycott of @TanishqJewelry for highlighting Hindu-Muslim unity through this beautiful ad. If Hindu-Muslim ‘ekatvam’ irks them so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India?”

Likewise, author Shobhaa De had said, “Good for you @TanishqJewelry. If only we had more ads like this sensitive and brilliant one promoting love between different communities, India would be a far better place for all. Shame on trolls #downwithbigotry.”

Agreeing to Ms. De’s tweet the RPG Group’s Harsh Goenka had tweeted, “What a lovely ad is being trolled. What’s happening to us?”

Author Chetan Bhagat also tweeted, “As a TATA group company, expected #Tanishq to be fairer and braver. If you have done nothing wrong, if you have shown something beautiful about our country, don’t get bullied. Be Indian. Be strong.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nowq1j/article32841431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tanishqpng,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tanishq-withdraws-advertisement-on-inter-faith-marriage-following-social-media-criticism/article32841428.ece

The Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog is targeting production of 33 crore eco-friendly earthen lamps (diyas) made from cow dung during Diwali next month, in order to counter Chinese products, its Chairman Vallabhbhai Kathiria said on Monday.

The Aayog, set up in 2019 for the protection, promotion and conservation of indigenous cattle in the country, has started a nation-wide campaign to encourage use of cow dung-based products during the forthcoming festival.

“Rejecting China-made diyas, the campaign will boost ‘Make in India’ concept of the Prime Minister and swadeshi movement,” Mr. Kathiria said in a press conference here.

More than 15 states have agreed to be part of the campaign. About 3 lakh diyas will be lit in the holy city of Ayodhya, while 1 lakh diyas in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, he said.

“The manufacturing has started. We are targeting 33 crore diyas before Diwali,” he said.

“About 192 crore kilo of cow dung per day is produced in India at present. There is huge untapped potential in cow dung-based products,” he said.

The Aayog said though it is not directly involved in production of cow dung-based products, it is facilitating and offering training to self help groups and entreprenuers seeking to set up business.

Besides diyas, the Aayog is promoting production of other products made from dung, urine and milk such as

anti-radiation chip,

paper weights,

Ganesha and Lakshmi idols,

incense sticks,

candles among others.

Mr. Kathiria said this initiative will help cow shelters (Gaushals), which are currently in financial trouble due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to become self-reliant besides creating job opportunities in rural India.

“The trend needs to be reversed and popular perception about cow and cow-based agriculture and cow-based industry need to be corrected immediately for social and economic rejuvenation of society particularly poor in rural areas,” he added.

A series of webinars are being organised with stakeholders like farmers, cow shelter operators, entreprenuers to be part of this campaign, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z64fjz/article32841060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VALLABHBHAIKATHIRIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cow-dung-based-anti-radiation-chip-diyas-idols-incense-sticks-on-the-anvil/article32841061.ece

Several renowned personalities from J&K have asked Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Manoj Sinha on Monday to intervene and stop any move to set up government offices in two protected monuments, Mubarak Mandi in Jammu and Shergarhi complex in Srinagar.

A joint letter signed by 22 dignitaries from different walks of life pointed out the Shergahi complex, Srinagar, an 18th century structure, was declared a State Protected Monument in July 2017. “We have received disturbing information that the Union Territory (UT) administration is proposing to shift some government departments to the complex. This will irreversibly tamper with its historic character. It is requested that no action should be taken to dilute the integrity of the complex, like locating government offices in protected monuments,” the signatories said.

The joint petition underlined that “any inappropriate use of these buildings will go against the letter and spirit of their status as State protected monuments.”

“We also demand that the process of their preservation initiated in the previous years be speeded up and taken to its logical conclusion,” it said.

It said the two monuments stand out for their architectural style and decorative elements, which are also a testimony to the inclusive and composite character of J&K.

90,2020/10/13,Local elections postponed for three months in Gujarat,"The entire machinery is involved in handling the pandemic, says State government

The Gujarat Election Commission has postponed the municipal and panchayat elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The elections for local bodies of self-governance including six municipal corporations, 55 municipalities, 31 district and 231 taluka panchayats were scheduled to be held in November.

After taking stock of the pandemic situation, the Commission has announced that the polls would be postponed for three months.

Now, the elections for civic bodies of Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar and the district panchayats will be held in 2021.

91,2020/10/13,Courts cannot meddle in food habits of people: SC,"Apex court dismisses petition for ban on halal form of slaughter

The Supreme Court on Monday said courts cannot meddle in the food habits of people.

A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul was hearing a petition filed by Akhand Bharat Morcha for ban on halal form of slaughter.

“Court cannot determine who can be a vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Those who want to eat halal meat can eat halal meat. Those who want to eat jhatka meat can eat jhatka meat,” the court said orally.

The petition raised a challenge against Section 28 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act which allows slaughter of animals in a manner consonant to one’s religion.

The petition argued that halal manner of slaughter is painful and amounts to cruelty. Whereas jhatka — which is a single fatal blow — is painless.

The court said the petition was filed with ‘mischievous’ intention and dismissed it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/courts-cannot-meddle-in-food-habits-of-people-sc/article32839047.ece

93,2020/10/13,Punjab BJP president’s vehicle attacked in Hoshiarpur,"Party blames Congress. CM dismisses it and orders probe

Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma’s vehicle was allegedly attacked by a group of people on Monday near the Cholang toll plaza in Hoshiarpur district.

Mr. Sharma, who was on his way back to Pathankot from Jalandhar, said the group attacked the vehicle he was travelling in with stones and sticks, in which the windowpanes of his car were damaged. He said his security guards helped him escape safely.

Station House Officer (Tanda) Bikram Singh told reporters that the incident took place when the vehicle was close to the Cholang toll plaza near Tanda area. Several farmers have laid siege at the toll plaza in protest against the Centre’s agriculture sector laws for the past few days.

Mr. Sharma said those who attacked his vehicle were not farmers and it was an attempt to defame the farmers’ agitation.

Senior party leader Manoranjan Kalia said the incident was the handiwork of the Congress to extract political gains.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh condemned the incident but rubbished the allegations of party’s involvement.

“Strongly condemn attack on @BJP4Punjab chief @AshwaniSBJP and have asked @DGPPunjabPolice to identify culprits and take immediate action. Won’t let anyone disturb State’s peace or take law into their hands,” he said as quoted by his media adviser Raveen Thukral on twitter.

“There is no question of @INCPunjab involvement in attack on @BJP4Punjab chief @AshwaniSBJP and @BJP4India should refrain from making frivolous and politically motivated allegations. This is highly irresponsible as @PunjabPoliceInd are investigating the case,” said the tweet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/punjab-bjp-presidents-vehicle-attacked-in-hoshiarpur/article32839035.ece

102,2020/10/13,TTD drops processions in mada streets during Brahmotsavams,"Plans changed as per Centre’s fresh norms on religious events

Adopting a pragmatic approach towards the dreaded COVID-19 which is yet to come under control, the TTD on Tuesday announced that it was confining the celebrations related to the Navaratri Brahmotsavams to the inner portals of the temple of Lord Venkateswara here.

All the vahana sevas will be observed at the Kalyanotsava Mandapam inside the temple in ‘ekantham’ (without presence of devotees).

TTD’s Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel (SVBC) will telecast live all the proceedings of the nine-day festival commencing on October 16.

On October 1, the TTD announced that the daily processions of various vahanams would be taken out in the mada streets encircling the shrine and also allow a limited number of devotees to witness the festivities from the open galleries. To ensure sufficient physical distance among devotees, markings were also painted at the galleries.

However, the new TTD Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy, who till recently closely monitored the COVID-19 situation as the Special Chief Secretary, Health, Medical and Family Welfare, before the current posting, is said to be averse to taking any risk with pilgrim safety and resolved to confine the festivities to the temple in adherence to the health guidelines issued by both the State and Central governments.

Deliberations

Mr. Reddy had detailed talks with DIG Kranti Rana Tata, Collector Bharat Narayana Gupta, Additional EO A.V. Dharma Reddy, CVSO Gopinath Jatti and health and medical experts and is believed to have apprised Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and TTD Chairman Y.V. Subbareddy before taking the final call.

The fresh health guidelines issued by the Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry that none of the religious or cultural events conducted outdoor should exceed a congregation of 200 persons is believed to be the major reason for arriving at the decision, besides the fact that there is no significant reduction in infections during the past 20 days since the completion of the first Brahmotsavams.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ttd-drops-processions-in-mada-streets-during-brahmotsavams/article32844815.ece

The Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams (TTD on Tuesday decided to confine the celebrations relating to Navaratri Brahmotsavams to the inner portals of the temple of Lord Venkateswara in keeping with the COVID-19 situation.

On October 1, TTD had announced daily processions on various vahanams around the mada streets encircling the shrine and had also allowed a limited number of devotees.

To ensure sufficient physical distance among the devotees markings were painted at the open top galleries around the mada streets – the place where pilgrims congregate to witness daily processions.

The new TTD Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy, however, decided to confine the festivities in the temple with strict adherence to health guidelines issued by both the State and central governments. All the vahana sevas will be observed at Kalyanotsava mandapam inside the hill temple.

Mr. Reddy held marathon meetings with DIG Kranti Rana Tata, Collector Bharat Narayana Gupta, Additional EO A.V. Dharma reddy, CVSO Gopinath Jatti, health and medical experts and is believed to have apprised Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Chairman Y.V. Subbareddy before taking the final call.

The rider imposed in the fresh health guidelines issued recently by Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry that none of the religious or cultural extravaganzas conducted outdoor should exceed a congregation of more than 200 persons is believed to have formed the crux of the decision.

The fact that there has been no significant reduction in COVID-19 infections during the last twenty days, since the completion of the first Brahmotsavams, is also believed to have influenced the decision.

Mr. Singh asked the apex court to issue an order to bar Mr. Reddy from making such public statements against the judiciary and holding press conferences to malign the judicial institution.

“What is at stake is the confidence that courts inspire in the public in a democracy ... Discussions can go wild in the media within hours or days and affect the image of the judiciary,” the petition said.

The right places to bring allegations against the higher judiciary are Parliament or the State Legislature and not press conferences.

The petition said the constitutional immunity granted to the judiciary was to allow them to function fearlessly.

“Today criticism is levelled against the judiciary with more readiness and less deference than in the past. The respondent [Mr. Reddy] is duty-bound to respect the judiciary,” the petition said.

It said Mr. Reddy “totally failed to understand and appreciate” that “irresponsible statements” would destabilise public faith in the judiciary.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/r65joo/article30478563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1hyabh08CBI-couGLS6LH7OC3-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/petition-in-sc-seeks-notice-against-jagan/article32838083.ece
108,2020/10/13,"Country staring at starvation, job loss: Chinta","‘NDA govt. has thrown Indian economy into peril’

Former Union Minister and Congress Working Committee (CWC) special invitee Chinta Mohan on Monday alleged that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre had thrown the country’s economy into peril, leading to growing levels of starvation, job losses and plummeting of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Staging a protest at his residence in Tirupati, the former MP said that going by the latest trends, as many as 10 crore people in the country were under starvation, with just a single meal in a day, while food grain crisis had gripped a population of over 30 crore population, and 12 crore were rendered jobless, besides devastating the lives of small traders and daily wagers.

Fall in industrial production

Chinta Mohan maintained that the industrial production had come down to 25% after the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. Production at most MSMEs came to a grinding halt due to lack of working capital and support from banks. “The banking sector operations are the worst hit, providing no loans and receiving no deposits. The banks are now depending on the RBI to avail reserve funds,” he said. The middle class sections in the country were in jeopardy too, unable to clear their EMIs and various loans as the moratorium parameters lacked clarity, he said.

The Congress leader said that the exports had slipped to 35%, which led to the wiping out of the GDP regime and pushing the economy into depression.

Demanding the scrapping of the three farm Bills recently passed in the Parliament, Dr Chinta Mohan felt that they would be detrimental to the marginal and small farmers, and destabilize the MSP (minimum support price), introduced by Indira Gandhi.

He alleged that during the NDA regime, the atrocities against women had touched its peak, besides imperiling the safety of the SC/ST and OBC communities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/country-staring-at-starvation-job-loss-chinta/article32838750.ece
109,2020/10/13,"YSRCP is belittling emotion and resolve of people, says CPI","Narayana dares Jagan to go for polls over three capitals

The Communist Party of India (CPI) has said that it would lend support in the next elections to the party which will retain Amaravati as the State capital and fight for Special Category Status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh.

The party cadre staged a demonstration at the Sub-Collector’s office here on Monday to commemorate the 300th day of the Amaravati agitation. Speaking on the occasion, CPI national Secretary K. Narayana said the party had taken a firm stand on the capital issue and would not accept the ‘three capitals’ proposal at any cost.

Dig at Botcha

Condemning the remarks made by Minister Botcha Satyanarayana that Amaravati agitators are ‘paid artistes’, the CPI leader said, “It is a matter of shame that the ruling party leaders are belittling the emotions and resolve of those who are fighting for their rights. The protest is a battle for their survival. No government has the right to take a decision without the people’s approval.”

He also dared Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to go for polls on the ‘three capitals’ issue.

Taking a dig at the YSRCP, he said that the government had achieving nothing except for selling sand and encroaching upon land belonging to the Dalits.

“People of the State will teach the YSRCP and its leaders a lesson, if they do not shed their adamant stand on derailing the development of a region on the pretext of decentralisation,” Mr. Narayana said.CPI State secretariat member P. Harinatha Reddy flayed the proposal to shift the Chief Minister’s camp office to Visakhapatnam. He recalled that the ruling party, in its first meeting after bifurcation, had proposed Vijayawada as the State capital, and it should adhere to it.

110,2020/10/13,JAC members continue stir for Amaravati as capital,"‘Govt. that is indifferent to farmers’ plight has no right to be in power’

Members of the the Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti Joint Action Committee (APS-JAC) in the district staged a demonstration in front of the Prakasam Bhavan here on Monday demanding retention of Amaravati as the one and only capital of Andhra Pradesh.

The JAC members came in a big procession to the Church Centre raising slogans against the Jagan Mohan Reddy Government and demanding that they drop its three capital move.

Speaking on the occasion, All India Kisan Sabha national vice-president Ravula Venkaiah said it was unfortunate that the YSR Congress Party Government did not take into consideration the sacrifice made by farmers who had parted with their precious land, for building a capital for the State divided in an unscientific manner without a capital.

TDP Ongole Lok Sabha constituency unit president N.Balaji questioned the need for three capitals for a small Sate which was now struggling to overcome bifurcation blues including huge un-bridged revenue deficit.

Andhra Pradesh Rationalists Association president N.Venkata Subbaiah felt that a government that was indifferent to farmers who have been agitating for the last 300 days had no moral right to be in power.

Activists of the Communist Party of India(CPI), CPI(M), CPI(ML) also expressed solidarity with the agitating farmers and civil society organisations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/q507y5/article32838739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13VJJACONG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jac-members-continue-stir-for-amaravati-as-capital/article32838740.ece

Refuting the allegations over the illegal sand mining at Oleru in Bhattirprolu mandal, Vemuru MLA Meruga Nagarjuna has said that he has no role in it. On Monday, the MLA submitted a letter to Collector I. Samuel Ananda Kumar, urging him to take action against those involved in the illegal mining. He sought information whether any permission was given to mine sand from the land belonging to Aadi Andhra Cooperative Society at Oleru. He also sought to know about the survey number and the extent of mining done in case permission was accorded.

“A malicious campaign has been launched against me. I have been working under the leadership of Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy for the betterment of lives of Dalits,” he said.

112,2020/10/13,Heavy rain under influence of depression brings back horrific memories of cyclones,"North Andhra region has endured three cyclones in last seven years, all on Oct. 11 and 12

With heavy rains and gales lashing Visakhapatnam on Monday amid the forecast of a deep depression crossing the north Andhra coast by Tuesday morning, the memories of cyclones in previous years came flooding to the denizens.

It was on October 11 and 12 when the city and the north coastal districts endured the wrath of three very severe cyclonic storms, equivalent to category IV and V hurricane. All these cyclones either struck or left their destructive impact on the city, when they made landfalls in the neighbouring coastal districts in the last seven years.

On October 2013, the north coastal districts were rattled when very severe cyclonic storm Phailin crossed the A.P. coast and made landfall in Gopalpur in Odisha on October 12. This was followed by very severe cyclonic storm Hudhud that made a landfall in the city on October 12, 2014. It left a trail of destruction and the normal life remained out of gear for over a month.

“The memories of Hudhud is still vivid in our minds. We experienced wind over 200 km per hour. Today’s rain really brought back those memories as it happened on the same day,” said D. Narayana Rao, a Central government employee.

Apart from extensive damage to properties and rendering thousands homeless, at least 124 people had died in the three coastal districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam.

On October 11, 2018, Visakhapatnam experienced the fury of very severe cyclonic storm Titli which made a landfall near Palasa in Srikakulam district. At least 77 people had died in Odisha and eight in Andhra Pradesh.

‘Ideal season for cyclones’

However, Prof. S.S.V.S. Ramakrishna from the Department of Meteorology and Oceanography of Andhra University, called it a coincidence.

“Usually, October and November see cyclones. At times, it extends to December. This is the period when the south-west monsoon retreats and the north-east monsoon sets in. It is the transition period and the possibilities of formation of depressions over the Bay of Bengal is high. But luckily, the present weather system is only a depression and it is likely to pass off as a deep depression, without turning into a cyclone,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jjdb60/article32840311.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VisakhapatnamCTH13PAGE1CYCLONEjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/heavy-rain-under-influence-of-depression-brings-back-horrific-memories-of-cyclones/article32838727.ece
113,2020/10/13,Digital teaching will ensure wider reach: Minister,"Ramesh Pokhriyal stresses on need for newer avenues in Sanskrit research

Union Minister for Education Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank has suggested that innovation and digital teaching will go a long way in reaching out to the target audience.

Participating virtually in the national symposium on ‘Sanskrit teaching – with special reference to National Education Policy 2020’ organised by the National Sanskrit University here on Monday, he spoke on the new educational policy unveiled early this year and its implications on various streams of education. Mr. Pokhriyal also stressed the need for newer avenues in Sanskrit research, which he called the ‘need of the hour’.

Books released

Dwelling on the NEP-20, the Minister explained Sanskrit as a knowledge system and the application of simple standard Sanskrit in teaching and learning. Laying emphasis on preparing textbooks accordingly, the Minister also suggested integration of Sanskrit with other modern subjects. He later released two electronic books viz., ‘National Educational Policy 2020’ and ‘New trends in psychology’, both in the Sanskrit medium.

Vice-Chancellor V. Muralidhara Sharma, in his presidential address, said that the varsity was striving hard to implement the new education policy, besides reaching out to newer sections of students through online mediums and digital teaching. Symposium coordinator R. Chandrasekhar, Dean (Faculty of Education) Prahlad Joshi, head P. Venkata Rao spoke, while S.L. Seetharama Sharma acted as the additional coordinator.

Mr. Lokesh was accompanied by Member of Parliament, Guntur, Galla Jayadev and former Tadikonda MLA Tenali Sravan Kumar, as he joined the protests at Venkatapalem and Penumaka villages.

Alleging that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had been trying to kill the “baby capital” of Andhra Pradesh in utter disregard for the rights and sacrifices of farmers who gave away 34,000 acres in response to a call given by the then Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, Mr. Lokesh said the Amaravati region was selected in tune with the wishes of all people of the State.

“Even Mr. Jagan spoke in favour of Amaravati selection on the floor of the Assembly in his capacity as Opposition Leader at that time,” he said.

Addressing protesters at Penumaka, Mr. Lokesh said it was Mr. Jagan, who, in fact, demanded an equidistant new Capital to North Andhra and Rayalaseema in over 30,000 acres where there would be no water shortage, and Amaravati had met all these parameters.

“Mr. Jagan, who approved Amaravati while in Opposition and even made people believe in that stand, completely changed his stance and started shifting Capital after coming to power,’’ allegedMr. Lokesh.

Stating that Mr. Jagan was incapable of bringing development, Mr. Lokesh pointed out that not even a single industry had come up in Visakhapatnam and North Andhra, and the rest of the State in the past 17 months. What more, the port city had become witness to unchecked land grabs and private settlements with law and order problems, he alleged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bcniqv/article32838714.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13VJLOKESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-trying-to-kill-baby-capital-of-state-says-lokesh/article32838715.ece

Though the incident took place on Saturday night, it came to light on Monday when the girls along with their parents lodged a complaint against the accused in the police station.

According to the police, a man aged around 24 years befriended a 14-year-old girl from Gajuwaka area, sometime ago. Recently, he introduced her and another friend of the girl who is around 15 years, to his friend.

On Saturday, both the men took the girls on their bikes to a beach and later to an empty shed in Duvvada area where they allegedly sexually assaulted them.

Based on the complaint from the girls, the Duvvada police registered a case against the duo and the case has been transferred to Disha police station for further investigation.

The police shifted the girls to King George Hospital for medical examination and launched a manhunt for the accused.

It may be recalled that a few days ago, a pastor was arrested on charges of attempt to rape a 16-year-old girl at Gajuwaka here.

Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan has asked the State government officials to expedite the works to ensure drinking water supply to schools and Anganwadi centres through pipelines under the Jal Jeevan Mission, a campaign launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 2.

The initiative is aimed at providing safe and adequate drinking water supply to all households in rural India through individual tap connections by 2024.

Mr. Harichandan reviewed the implementation of the mission with Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney through video link on Monday.

“The initiative will have a positive impact on children’s health and holistic growth. Children are more prone to water-borne diseases such as dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera and etc. All the schools and Anganwadi centres should be covered under the scheme and the works should be undertaken on a mission mode by involving all the departments concerned,” said Mr. Harichandan.

Target set

Mr. Nilam Sawhney said that of the 95,66,332 rural households in the State, only 33% had water tap connections and a target had been set to cover all the households by 2024. “Already 45% of the total 44,782 schools and 35% of the 55,607 Anganwadi centres in the State have water supply through pipelines under the Nadu Nedu scheme and the rest will have the facility by the end of December,” said Ms. Sawhney.

The student and youth wing activists of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) painted a grim picture of the State without Amaravati as the capital.

In a mock protest conducted on Monday, members of the Telugu Nadu Students Federation (TNSF) dressed up as construction workers and staged a demonstration in front of a building under construction. Their protest was to throw light on the possible rampant unemployment in future that could reduce engineers and technocrats to daily wagers.

‘Decentralisation will derail development’

Accusing the State government of putting spokes in development by creating confusion on the capital issue, the protesting members, led by TNSF national coordinator A. Ravi Naidu and its Chittoor district president R. Anand Goud, said the government should withdraw the decentralisation move.

The students recalled that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had, as the Opposition leader, acknowledged on the floor of the house the need for developing 30,000 acres in Amaravati as the capital, and questioned how he could go back on his word now. “No investor has come up with fresh proposals in the State. This bears testimony to the doubts persistent in their minds,” Mr. Ravi Naidu said.

Tirumala Tiruptai Devasthanms Additional Executive officer A.V. Dharma Reddy on Monday exhorted donors of vegetables to supply more varieties for the benefit of the visiting pilgrims.

Acclaiming their diligent contributions since 2004, he said it was owing to their generous service that the TTD was able to provide tasty and quality food to the devout under its pet Nitya Annadanam scheme.

The TTD received a whopping 1,857 tonnes of vegetables during 2019-20 as against a paltry 165 tonnes during the year till September, and attributed the dip in the receipts to coronavirus pandemic as well as the closure of the temple for public for over 80 days during the peak summer.

Heeding the request of Mr. Reddy, the donors reacted positively for the supply of more varieties of vegetables during the Brahmotsavams scheduled to commence from October 16.

119,2020/10/13,Swashakthi helps members achieve financial freedom,"Society also promotes social awareness among its women

Dominance of money-lenders and micro finance institutions has come to an end in many villages of Vajrapukotturu mandal of Srikakulam district, thanks to the collective efforts of women who could become self-reliant financially with their own planning and hard work.

Money-lenders used to collect up to 5% interest per month from women who were forced to borrow money for their petty business activities such as running a tailoring shop, sale of coconuts or investment on agriculture. They used to pay ₹800 to ₹1,000 as interest per month if they were given ₹20,000 loan.

As many as 6,120 women became members of the Swashakthi Mutually-aided Cooperative Society and were able to create ₹80 lakh fund on their own. The society gives soft loans at nominal interest rates for income generation activities. The maximum interest rate is 12% per annum and a concession is given if loans are taken for three and six months. The interest is hardly ₹200 per month if ₹20,000 loan is taken from the society. The loan facility is extended only to group members.

Moved by the pathetic situation of women of interior villages, the Bapuji Rural Enlightenment and Development Society (BREDS) has helped them form small self-help groups in 1995 itself, says its chief executive officer A. Ramakrishna Raju.

Training

The self-employment training programmes, government schemes of the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) were explained to the distressed women, who then established the Swashakti organisation.

“Swashakthi is going to be the biggest women’s organisation in Andhra Pradesh with 10,000 members within a couple of years,” Mr. Raju tells The Hindu.

The society president Akku Dhana Lakshmi and secretary K. Saraswathi say that financial independence helped the women members lead a comfortable life even during the COVID-19 crisis. “Every member is encouraged to involve in society administrative activities also. It develops leadership qualities among them,” says Mrs. Dhana Lakshmi.

The society members are also involved in social awareness programmes. They have to get their children married only after completion of intermediate education. They are aware of the Domestic Violence Act, consumer rights and other laws. “The society members serve as an inspiration to many others in Palasa, Mandasa and other mandals,” says BREDS secretary V.

120,2020/10/13,Palm jaggery traders make hay on Chittoor highways,"It is in demand for its therapeutic qualities and affordable price

Motorists driving along the national highways through Chittoor district towards Tamil Nadu and Karnataka will be greeted to the spectacle of roadside vendors selling palm jaggery arranged neatly in large piles, shouting ‘Karuppati vellam’ to attract buyers.

Dozens of palm jaggery traders have arrived from Tirunelveli and Ramanathapuram districts of Tamil Nadu to set up stalls along the highways, carrying with them truckloads of jaggery. Due to the ongong COVID-19 pandemic, palm jaggery is now in demand as it is considered good for building immunity. As such, the traders are looking to reap profits by selling high-quality palm jaggery at competitive prices.

Palm jaggery is also used as an ingredient in ‘halwa’ and ‘nippatlu’, and thus is highly sought after.

The traders have adopted an aggresive marketing strategy to entice motorists. They have began announcing through hand-held megaphones about the therapeutic effects of palm jaggery and its efficacy in keeping infections at bay, and assure that the jaggery is free of chemicals. They reiterate that they are from Tirunelveli, as the district is known for its high-quality palm jaggery.

With prices hovering around ₹140 a kg, motorists too find it affordable and buy some jaggery to give it a try. The jaggery lumps are displayed in an eye-catching way, by being stacked like a wall of bricks.

“This is the right time for us to do business in other States. The pandemic has come as a boon to us. We perceived that the majority of the people are now taking immunity seriously. As palm jaggery is considerably costly in the hinterland, far away from coastal belts, we are able to attract customers with our low prices. Carrying bulk stocks and disposing them of quickly is ensuring us decent profits,” said Prakash, a young seller from Tirunelveli, who has set up a stall at Narayanavanam crossroads on the Chennai highway.

Parthibhan, another trader camping at Pichatur on the same highway, said that apart from residents of surrounding villages, a number of motorists from Tamil Nadu, mostly from Chennai, on their return journey are giving them major patronage. “People from Tamil Nadu are aware about the importance of palm jaggery, particularly at a time like this. Moreover, palm jaggery is a regular ingredient for a number of traditional families of Tamil Nadu. As our price is somewhat lesser than in Chennai, naturally they buy from us in large quantities here,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/7ejg7c/article32838369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05-VJ-PALMJAGGERY1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/palm-jaggery-traders-make-hay-on-chittoor-highways/article32838370.ece
121,2020/10/13,Exotic dragon fruit gets added to Anantapur basket,"It is ready for harvest after painstakingly raised by a progressive farmer

The first-ever commercial crop of the exotic dragon fruit is being harvested at the farm of Gutty Narayana Reddy, a progressive farmer from Kuragani Palli in Narpala mandal of Anantapur district. This will be yet another prestigious addition to the fruit bowl of Andhra Pradesh with the best quality of bananas, sweet lime, papaya, mangoes, pomegranates, grapes, watermelon, musk melon and fig (anjeer), already getting exported from the district.

Not many know about the fruit due to its lack of availability in the market and have developed a resistance towards it going by its appearance. A bright pink fruit of the size of a medium papaya, dragon fruit grows on a climbing cactus called hylocereus in tropical regions. It takes 50 days for an attractive flower to convert into a fruit with soft pink outside shell and ripen for plucking. There are two variants with white juicy flesh and small black seeds or pink flesh with black seeds and a slight variation in the sweetness.

Initial failure

It is grown in small pockets of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab and many other States. Mr. Narayana Reddy, a sweet lime farmer, makes regular visits to Aurangabad in Maharashtra to sell his produce and happened to see this fruit in a farm in 2017 November. The following year, he brought some saplings from there and planted them in a 3-acre farm in the village in 2018. As the crop failed, he approached the horticulture scientists of Acharya NG Ranga University’s Research Centre at Rekulakunta. The advice provided by P. Deepthi and Vimala Bathineni transformed the growth of plants in his farm and today Mr. Narayana Reddy is a happy man expecting at least some returns from the huge investment he made.

“I have invested ₹14.5 lakh on the farm and expect to harvest at least 6 tonnes in the first season,” Mr. Narayana Reddy told The Hindu. He might not recover his investment in the near future but is buoyant about the fact that he was successful in producing the fruit, which mostly comes from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and China.

Sold at ₹200 a kg in the retail market, Mr. Narayana Reddy expects to sell the fruit that has one month of shelf life, in the wholesale market at ₹100 to ₹150 a kg.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vwpu0o/article32838363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13VJDRAGONFRUIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/exotic-dragon-fruit-gets-added-to-anantapur-basket/article32838364.ece
122,2020/10/13,"Do not let your guard down post COVID-19, say doctors","People are reporting various symptoms even after recovery

With one in four recovered patients turning up at hospitals with post COVID-19 infections, doctors say it is important that patients do not let their guard down even after recovery.

Doctors are seeing people reporting various symptoms ranging from recurrence of fever and cough to breathlessness due to fibrosis or scarring in the lungs, cardiac issues and stroke due to blood clotting.

While some patients are reporting psychological distress, others have minor issues that can be treated with just a little counselling, said doctors.

Sudarshan Ballal, Chairman of Manipal Hospitals, who is also part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said apart from these symptoms, most are complaining about fatigue.

“We have seen nearly 25% of recovered patients coming back with complaints. We have also seen two patients, who developed a reinfection. They had recovered in July and had tested negative before discharge. But they came back recently with a RT-PCR positive report,” he said.

Advising patients to strictly follow their doctor’s advice post recovery, Dr. Ballal said it is important that they do not compromise on precautions such as mask wearing and maintaining social distancing.

“Oxygen saturation levels must be monitored regularly and CT scan of the lungs should be repeated for those who return with breathlessness. Those with comorbid conditions should take extra care,” he said.

Pulmonologist K.S. Satish, who is also part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said every recovered patient can have one or the other post COVID-19 issue even up to 90 days. “Minor issues do not need any medication and can be treated through counselling. Those who return with mild lung issues can be treated just through pulmonary rehabilitation (physiotherapy). People are unnecessarily getting hysterical,” he said.

Stating that only around 10% of patients, who would have required ventilator support (during the first infection), are returning with fibrosis, Dr. Satish who is also the president of Karnataka Pulmonologists Association said: “That can also be treated over a period of time and people need not panic.”

“If this is done for appropriate patients, we could free up almost 50% of hospital beds at any given time by bringing down the average length of stay for COVID-19 patients.

The police arrested three people in connection with the murder of a beggar, whose identity is yet to be ascertained.

Hassan Superintendent of Police R. Srinivasa Gowda, in a press conference in Hassan on Tuesday, shared information about the investigation with the media. A half-burnt dead body was found near Arekere near Banavara on January 6 this year.

The investigation did not proceed until S. Siddarameshwara, Belur CPI, received a call from the informant from Lakya village in Chikkamagaluru taluk recently. The caller said that a group of three persons had killed a beggar in the village over a petty issue. The officer and his team took three suspects — Srikanth, 26, Mohan, 29, and Chetan, 29 — into custody.

Mr. Gowda said the three, who were in an inebriated condition, picked up a quarrel with the beggar at Lakya. They assaulted him. In retaliation, the beggar bit Srikanth’s hand and ran away. Later, the three caught the beggar and killed him by hitting him with sticks. To avoid getting caught, they threw the body near Arakere after burning it.

The Mysuru railway station was adjudged the ‘best maintained station’ for 2019-20 under the category of “major” stations of the South Western Railway.

This was announced during the 65th Railway Week Celebrations at Hubballi on Tuesday, during which the Mysuru Divisional Railway also bagged other honours.

Mysuru station underwent a major transportation under the Comprehensive Station Redevelopment Plan undertaken during the year, according to local authorities. A release said that the station saw the addition of many passenger-friendly initiatives with care taken to retain the heritage value of the building. “The redevelopment of the station has brought appreciation from different forums,” the release added.

Recent upgrade

The Signal & Telecommunication Department (S&T) of the Mysuru division won the Zonal Efficiency Shield for the year 2019-20. The department recently upgraded signalling technology in the Sakleshpur-Subramanya Ghat section in record time, paving the way for enhanced safety and sectional capacity despite facing hurdles in the hostile territory as also battling COVID-19.

As a result of the new installation, the Railways can now explore the possibility of introducing additional passenger services in the ghat section, a demand remaining unfulfilled as the Commissioner of Railway Safety had imposed restrictions in operations of passenger services owing to safety reasons. The freight trains can now run at higher speeds leading to higher productivity, according to the release.

The Security Department of Mysuru division also bagged the efficiency shield for 2019-20.

130,2020/10/13,INTACH begins groundwork eyeing UNESCO world heritage tag for Mysuru,"The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) has begun the groundwork to pitch Mysuru as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Both Jaipur and Ahmedabad have been certified as world heritage sites and INTACH is confident that Mysuru will qualify for the UNESCO certification as it has a history of art, culture, and architecture that have evolved over the last few centuries.

However, the process is elaborate and could take years to even reach the nomination stage as the number of monuments from India under the ‘tentative list’ is long. “But the preliminary ground work pertaining to collection of documents to establish the historicity of Mysuru, apart from highlighting its claim as a centre for culture has commenced,” said N.S. Rangaraju, convener, Mysuru chapter of INTACH.

He said this is one of the long-term objectives of INTACH, Mysuru chapter, as it shares lot of similarities with Jaipur which was certified by UNESCO as a world heritage city last year.

Jaipur was recognised for its history of city planning and construction. The same is true of Mysuru which took the lead in establishing an urban planning body in the City Improvement Trust Board in 1904.

Amalgam of styles

Besides, art historians have described Mysuru as an amalgam of different architectural styles as evident in the presence of nearly 250 buildings that have been identified as heritage structures and many of them have been converted to public offices.

If successful, it will help conserve heritage buildings which are on the verge of being dismantled and demolished by realtors, said Prof. Rangaraju. Structures apart, the city continues to be synonymous with culture and traditions and this is also one of the criteria prescribed for recognition as a world heritage centre.

Mysuru satisfies the UNESCO criteria that a city or a region should be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance.

“It is not the wealth of built structures of different styles alone but traditions and practices of which Dasara is just one example,” Prof. Rangaraju added.

The city and the region has an unbroken history of encouraging art and culture since historical times and these traditions including folk arts continue to be a part of the live heritage of the people of the region, he said.

INTACH Mysuru will rope in subject experts, including specialists who have worked for the Ahmedabad project, to prepare the documentation. “We would have covered sufficient grounds if not for the pandemic and will take up work once there is a semblance of normalcy,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dz4m5d/article32847034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGINTACH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/intach-begins-groundwork-eyeing-unesco-world-heritage-tag-for-mysuru/article32847036.ece

137,2020/10/13,"After meeting CM, Sriramulu says he is happy with the new portfolio","CM holds consultations with both Sriramulu and Sudhakar

Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa was able to convince senior Minister B. Sriramulu to accept the new portfolio given to him on Tuesday after holding a meeting with him and Medical Education Minister Dr. K. Sudhakar at his official residence.

Mr. Sriramulu, who was upset over the manner in which he was stripped of the Health portfolio that was given to Mr. Sudhakar, told reporters after meeting Mr. Yediyurappa that he had accepted the new responsibility of social welfare portfolio with happiness.

“In fact, I had requested the chief minister to give me social welfare portfolio when I was made minister. But I had then been allocated health department,” Mr. Sriramulu told reporters.

Stating that the health portfolio had been taken away from him due to technical reasons as it would be better for Mr. Sudhakar, who is a doctor, to handle the COVID-19 situation, he said, “Let us work together to provide relief to people of the state from COVID-19.""

He claimed that it was his opinion too for a long time that both health and medical education departments should be handled by one minister instead of the present system of bifurcating them.

The reshuffling had been made in the wake of constant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Karnataka at a time when other states have managed to reduce the number of cases.

To make-up for the stripping of Health Department, Mr. Sriramulu had been given social welfare portfolio which was taken away from Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol. But in the process, the chief minister had also taken away the backward classes portfolio from Mr. Sriramulu.

Mr. Sriramulu was said to be of the view that the manner in which the health portfolio was taken away from him would project him as inefficient. The chief minister reportedly advised Mr. Sriramulu, who has set his eyes on the deputy chief minister’s post, to be patient and to ensure that his dissatisfaction did not impact the party’s image during the run-up to the by-polls to two assembly seats.

Meanwhile, Mr. Sudhakar too tried to placate Mr. Sriramulu by describing him as an important leader who has been given the prominent portfolio of social welfare department. “In fact, his new department comes next only to Major Irrigation and PWD in terms of prominence,” he said.

“Sriramulu is not demoted as being projected by media. In fact, it is a promotion for him,” Mr. Sudhakar said, while maintaining that health portfolio had changed hands only for better co-ordination. “So far there was no proper co-ordination between the two departments at the ground-level as they were being headed by two ministers,” he said.

Though Mr. Sriramulu tried to project that he was happy with the new portfolio, he made an indirect mention that the COVID-19 cases had increased after Mr. Sudhakar took over the responsibility of handling the pandemic. “Earlier Mr. Sudhakar used to monitor the situation only in Bengaluru. When I left the responsibility [of monitoring the entire State], there used to be around 1,000 cases (per day in Bengaluru). Now we are seeing about 5,000 cases a day. It does not mean that Mr. Sudhakar is inefficient,” Mr. Sriramulu said, in an apparent attack against those who accused him of failure to handle the situation properly.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qn82y8/article32841368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sriramulu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/after-meeting-cm-sriramulu-says-he-is-happy-with-the-new-portfolio/article32841369.ece

140,2020/10/13,Well-known composer Rajan passes away,"The score of Rajan-Nagendra in the film music world is noteworthy; the brothers gave hits after hits for close to three decades

Acclaimed music composer Rajan, of Rajan-Nagendra fame, passed away at his residence in Bengaluru on Sunday night. Some of the best-remembered Kannada film songs of the 60s, 70s, and 80s were composed by the brothers.

“My father was healthy and took music classes online even the day before his death,” said the 85-year-old composer’s son R. Ananth Kumar. Rajan’s brother Nagendra had passed away in 2000, ending possibly one of the longest music collaborations in the film industry.

How it began

Hailing from Mysuru, the brothers were surrounded by music, as their father Rajappa worked as a musician for silent era films. The duo went to Chennai (then Madras), to learn music. While Rajan trained as a violinist, Nagendra learnt the harmonium. They were barely out of their teens when they debuted as music directors for the film Soubhagya Lakshmi in 1952.

“The then reigning singer Ghantasala reportedly refused to sing as the music was composed by children. But he eventually sang the songs and was all praise for the brothers after he listened to the compositions,” recalled senior film journalist N.S. Sridhar Murthy. The duo never looked back and went on to score music for 380 films - 212 Kannada, 45 Telugu, and the rest in Tamil, Malayalam, Tulu, and one Sinhala film.

70s and 80s

Rajan-Nagendra peaked in their popularity during the 1970s and 1980s. They composed music for most of Dr. Rajkumar, Vishnuvardhan, Anant Nag’s films and those of other stars of that era, including Eradu Kanasu, Bayalu Daari, Gandhada Gudi, Sri Srinivasa Kalyana, Avala Hejje, and Gaali Maatu. Endendu Ninnanu Maretu, Aakashave Beelali Mele, Hosa Baalige Nee Jotheyade, Mamaravello...Kogileyallo, Naliva Gulabi Hoove, are some of the superhits of Rajan-Nagendra. They are also credited with bringing Kishore Kumar to sing a Kannada song Adu adu aata Adu for Kulla Agent 000, produced by Dwarakish. They were particularly known for their duets, many rendered by S.P. Balasubrahmanyam and S. Janaki.

S.K. Bhagavan, veteran filmmaker, said that works of Rajan-Nagendra were marked by melody and elaborate string sections. He recalled how they divided tasks between each other and worked together excellently. “They quarrelled over tunes and background scores, but never allowed it to affect their relationship,” Mr. Bhagavan said.

“They used to ask for the film’s story, discuss song situations and compose music with the larger picture in mind. They used to give three tunes for every situation. Rarely did we have to ask for another,” he recalled.

‘Man of few words’

Mr. Bhagavan remembers Rajan as a man of few words with an almost inaudible voice. Rajan was very particular about the tune, and would not allow lyricists to write out of tune and he never changed his tune,” Mr. Bhagavan recalled. Known for their lilting duets, they were adamant that only S.P. Balasubrahmanyam and S. Janaki sing them, he said.

The brothers had slowly started retreating from the field as Hamsalekha and other new-age music composers entered the scene in the 90s. Nagendra’s death in 2000 ended their run decisively. In later years, Rajan composed music for devotional songs with his son R. Ananth Kumar, as Rajan-Ananth.

KSRTC chairman and MLA M. Chandrappa on Monday said the State corporation suffered a loss of ₹1,600 crore during the COVID-19-induced lockdown, and the Mysuru KSRTC division alone lost nearly ₹70 crore as the buses were off the roads for a long time.

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with the officials of KSRTC Mysuru urban and rural divisions here, he said the corporation was planning to provide free buses passes to labourers. Officials from the Department of Labour would be consulted on the plan as the step was expected to help them to overcome distress caused by the pandemic.

In view of the pandemic, the Mysuru Dasara festivities had been scaled down and therefore the KSRTC has decided to provide services as per the demand with the rural division running 70 buses and the urban division running 20 buses during the annual festivities, he added. He also spoke on extending relief to the KSRTC staff who died of COVID-19 after discussions with the government and said the merger of urban and rural KSRTC divisions in Mysuru would be explored.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ennopz/article32604169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGACBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ksrtc-lost-1600-crore-during-lockdown-mla/article32839023.ece
142,2020/10/13,"Sriramulu loses Health and Backward Classes Welfare, gets Social Welfare","Yediyurappa to meet ‘upset’ Minister today to convince him about decision

As anticipated, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday effected a minor reshuffle of portfolios, by taking away Health and Family Welfare from senior leader B. Sriramulu and handing it over to Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar for better handling of the COVID-19 situation.

In a bid to mollify the now upset BJP leader from Ballari, who was also stripped of the Backward Classes Welfare portfolio, the Chief Minister is set to meet Mr. Sriramulu on Tuesday morning in a bid to convince him of the decision taken.

While Health and Family Welfare was allocated to Dr. Sudhakar, the Chief Minister took back the Backward Classes Welfare portfolio.

Mr. Sriramulu has been given the Social Welfare portfolio, a notification from Raj Bhavan said.

Thanking the Chief Minister for having reposed faith in him and giving him an additional responsibility, Dr. Sudhakar said that controlling the pandemic and reducing the mortality rate were his priorities.

He added that it was easy for one Minister to coordinate between the Health and Family Welfare and the Medical Education departments.

Brief meeting

Earlier in the day, though Mr. Sriramulu met the Chief Minister a couple of hours before the notification came in to the public domain, the talks remained brief and inconclusive.

Timing questioned

It is learnt that Mr. Sriramulu questioned the timing of his removal in the midst of COVID-19 management efforts and expressed unhappiness over the decision.

“Before the decision to replace him, he was neither consulted nor informed. Mr. Sriramulu was told about the decision over the phone, which has upset him,” a source close to the Minister said.

As the decision became official, it is learnt that several party leaders called and advised him not to take any decision in haste.

By Monday evening, the Chief Minister also spoke to him over the phone, inviting him for a meeting on Tuesday morning to thrash out the differences.

The Chief Minister, it is learnt, told Mr. Sriramulu that he had been given Social Welfare, an important portfolio, and that the minor reshuffle should not be “taken to heart, and that he was with him.”

However, a source close to the Minister said: “He believes that the timing of his replacement was not right when an anticipated Cabinet expansion or reshuffle is being planned right after the byelections. Being replaced in the middle of COVID-19 management sends a wrong signal too. Taking away the Backward Classes Welfare portfolio has hurt him because it was given to him citing that he was a Backward Classes leader.”

Already, Mr. Sriramulu is learnt to be upset at being denied the post of Deputy Chief Minister and he was also not made Minister in charge of Ballari.

“The justification about Medical Education and Health and Family Welfare has also not cut any ice with him as he feels that if that was the case, it should have been done long ago,” the source added.

KPCC response

Meanwhile, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar has said that their charge of the State government’s incompetency has now come true.

“The Cabinet reshuffle is proof of this government’s miserable failure in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that the Health Minister has been changed adds credence to our charge that this government’s incompetency has led to massive loss of lives and livelihood,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qn2y87/article32838710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGOctRamuluREcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sriramulu-loses-health-and-backward-classes-welfare-gets-social-welfare/article32838711.ece

As the last date for filing nominations — October 16 — nears and the party is yet to announce tickets, and as a strong faction within the party is lobbying hard to deny him ticket, speculation is rife that he may even end up losing the race for nomination.

Mr. Munirathna held a meeting with his supporters in the constituency on Monday, where it is learnt that he expressed his wish to contest as an Independent candidate if denied ticket by the BJP. He reportedly took stock of the situation and sought suggestions. The idea of seeking ticket from the JD(S), which is yet to announce its candidate for R.R. Nagar, was also discussed, sources said.

144,2020/10/13,"Yediyurappa consulted Sriramulu and me before Cabinet rejig, says K. Sudhakar","Minister for Medical Education K. Sudhakar, who has been allocated the Health and Family Welfare portfolio, on Monday said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had discussed the issue last week with him and B. Sriramulu, who was handling the Health Department.

“Mr. Sriramulu, who was also looking after Backward Classes Welfare along with Health, was given an important portfolio of Social Welfare on his request,” said Dr. Sudhakar, who will now be handling both the Medical Education and Health Departments for containing the spread of COVID-19. The Social Welfare portfolio was with Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Sudhakar said the Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education Departments in the State have independent Ministers, but the departments at the Centre and in most States have one Minister. When there was no upper limit for the Cabinet, the portfolios were bifurcated to accommodate more ministerial aspirants. But for technical and administrative reasons, both should be handled by one Minister, he said.

While thanking the Chief Minister for “trusting” him with the Health portfolio, Dr. Sudhakar said he would strive to improve the public healthcare system in the State. “Healthcare management is a challenge. I wish to establish something like the Kerala model of healthcare in the State or even a better one for making our State a leader in public medical care,” he said.

On his meeting with the Chief Minister on the Dasara celebrations, the Minister said that Mr. Yediyurappa had said that the festivities should not become a reason for the spread of COVID-19. The emphasis was on simple celebrations adhering to traditional aspects, he said. “He [the CM] has told us to tackle the pandemic in Mysuru, where the positivity rate and death rate have gone up.”

Earlier, Dr. Sudhakar, who chaired a meeting with officials and doctors from his departments, said efforts were being made to increase the beds in government hospitals here from 600 to 800 and to address the matter of staff scarcity. Private hospitals have been strictly told to set aside 50% of their beds for COVID-19 management. The focus is now on bringing the death rate to less than 1%, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappa-consulted-sriramulu-and-me-before-cabinet-rejig-says-k-sudhakar/article32838544.ece
145,2020/10/13,Tobacco farmers in Karnataka seek reduction in penalty for excess cultivation,"With tobacco crop in Karnataka expected to cross the ceiling fixed by the Tobacco Board this year, farmers have urged the Centre to reduce the penalty imposed on them for cultivating excess.

Anticipating a production of close to 100 million kg, as against the ceiling of 88 million kg, because of favourable weather conditions, the tobacco farmers, wary of coughing up large sums in penalties, have urged the Centre to reduce the penalty for excess cultivation from the existing 15% on the proceeds of the sale to 5%.

Earlier this year, the Tobacco Board fixed 99 million kg as the crop size for Karnataka, but weeks later revised it to 88 million kg, fearing a dip in the global demand for the commodity because of COVID-19. It reduced the quantum for each of the 56,000 licensed growers from 1,700 kg to 1,552 kg.

However, Javare Gowda, president of Virginia Flue Cured (VFC) Tobacco Growers’ Federation of Karnataka, argued that the farmers had completed sowing operations by the time the board revised the crop size. “As tobacco in Mysuru region grows under rain-fed conditions, productivity varies depending on the weather. Ideal weather conditions and good agricultural practices by the growers have resulted in improved productivity per unit area,” he said. Questioning the rationale behind penalising farmers when nature is benevolent to them, Mr. Gowda expressed fear that growers would have to pay a penalty to the tune of ₹30 crore for excess production.

An estimated 90,000 farmers are believed to cultivate tobacco on more than 85,000 hectares in Periyapatna, Hunsur, K.R. Nagar, and H.D. Kote taluks in Mysuru district, besides in Arkalgud and Holenarsipur in the neighbouring Hassan district.

Meanwhile, auction of tobacco for the year 2020-21 have begun across all 11 platforms in the State, with the board taking the necessary precautions against the spread of COVID-19. While auctions at the large platforms in Periyapatna and Chilkunda began on September 30, operations at the remaining nine platforms began on October 7.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tobacco-farmers-in-karnataka-seek-reduction-in-penalty-for-excess-cultivation/article32838526.ece

K.R. Venugopal, Vice-Chancellor of the university, told The Hindu that nearly 40,000 final-year students were scheduled to appear for the examination that was scheduled at 2 p.m. “Our confidential section received a message on a social networking platform which had pictures of the question paper. After we verified them, we found that the paper was the same set that students were to answer. We immediately told colleges not to conduct the examination,” he said. He also said that the fresh date of the examination will be intimated to the students shortly.

A communication to all principals of the affiliated colleges on Monday said that Paper 6.2 -Principles and Practice of Auditing stands postponed. However, many colleges found it difficult to communicate the message to students as it came post noon. “Many students turned up at the examination centres and we had to ask them to leave,” the principal of a city-based college said.

147,2020/10/13,"Unhappy with manner of change in portfolio, Sriramulu likely to meet BJP high command","Senior Minister B. Sriramulu is said to be deeply upset with how the Health and Family Welfare Department has been wrested from him. As he is learnt to have decided to approach the BJP high command over the “injustice meted out to him”, the Cabinet reshuffle fiasco Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has carried out without consulting with the central leadership now threatens to backfire against him, sources in the party said. Mr. Yediyurappa is said to have reached out to Mr. Sriramulu and the duo are likely to meet over breakfast on Tuesday.

Mr. Sriramulu is upset with the timing of the change in portfolio though he is not averse to the Social Welfare Department, sources close to him said. In fact, he had sought the department over Health and Family Welfare in 2019, but the Chief Minister was insistent. Ever since COVID-19 became an issue from March, he has been deeply upset with how he has been sidelined. “By stripping him of COVID-19 responsibilities and now the ministry itself, the Chief Minister seems to have expressed his lack of confidence in Mr. Sriramulu’s efficiency, which no political leader will accept,” a source close to the leader said.

The Minister, when he met Mr. Yediyurappa on Monday morning, is said to have protested the portfolio of Backward Classes Welfare, related to Social Welfare, being wrested from him. “Social Welfare and Backward Classes Welfare are essentially one ministry, divided only recently on an ad-hoc basis. The move doesn’t make sense,” he is learnt to have argued. Mr. Sriramulu is also apprehensive that he may be trapped in a quagmire of competing claims and interests that have emerged for reservation recently — the increase of reservation to Scheduled Tribe, of which he is also a part, internal reservation for Scheduled Caste, and Kurubas demanding ST tag, sources close to him said.

Mr. Yediyurappa had almost signalled that he would choose Mr. Sriramulu as a Deputy Chief Minister during the 2018 Assembly polls. While Mr. Sriramulu has repeatedly expressed his wish to get the title, his tenure in the government has only been seen as a series of demotions — not being made Deputy CM, being divested of COVID-19 responsibilities during the pandemic, and now being divested of the Health portfolio.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/unhappy-with-manner-of-change-in-portfolio-sriramulu-likely-to-meet-bjp-high-command/article32838518.ece
148,2020/10/13,The ‘new normal’ in places of worship,"Precautionary measures that are in place to contain the spread of the virus have pushed places of worships to temporarily part from various familiar religious practices.

Amid a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in the city, temples, churches, mosques, and other places of worship have adopted various ‘new normal practices’, though devotees are still adjusting to them. Precautionary measures that are in place to contain the spread of the virus have pushed places of worships to temporarily part from various familiar religious practices.

Departing from the tradition during the Holy Communion, the consecrated bread or wafer is now being dropped into the hands of the communicants. “The Communion is received on the tongue. But due to these unprecedented circumstances, it is now received in the hands with safe distance maintained,” said J.A. Kantharaj, spokesperson of the Archdiocese of Bangalore. He said that earlier, those who could not come to churches, especially the sick, were given Communion in their homes once a week. “That practice has now been temporarily stopped,” he said.

Kuldeep Singh, secretary, Sri Guru Singh Sabha, said the karah prasad at gurudwaras that were distributed by hands were now being given through spoons. “Devotees are just getting used to it and some demand that it be distributed by hands,” he said. Maqsood Imran, Imam of Jamia Masjid at K.R. Market, said those attending prayers were asked to bring their own ‘janamaz’ (prayer mats). “Standing shoulder to shoulder was a must during congregational prayers. However, we are now maintaining social distancing and will continue till normalcy is restored,” he said.

Govindraj V. of the ancient Someshwara temple in Halasuru, said teertha and prasada were not being distributed at the temple. “Every Monday, we used to distribute milk. This has not resumed ever since we have opened the temple,” he said, adding them they get enquiries about distribution of prasada.

Meanwhile, ISKCON, which recently reopened for the public, is serving prasada. “Kichdi is generally served in leaf cups as prasada.

We are maintaining the temperature of the prasada above 70 degree Celsius, keeping them in hot cases at the place where it is served,” said a representative from ISKCON. He added that those who serve the prasada maintain distance, wear masks and gloves, and frequently sanitise their hands.

Gearing up for the festivals

With Dasara and Deepavali around the corner, temples are making elaborate arrangements to maintain and manage crowds. The Dodda Basavanagudi Managing Committee has written to the Muzarai Department seeking information on celebrating the famous Kadlekai Parishe, which falls on December 13-14.

Ravishankar G.N. of the committee said: “We do not know whether we will be allowed to publicly celebrate the Parishe which falls on the last Monday of Kartika Masa, which will begin in mid November.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi made the observations during the hearing of PIL petitions, seeking directions for timely holding of elections to the BBMP.

Earlier, the State Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi brought to the notice of the Bench that the State Legislature had recently amended the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act to increase the number of wards to 225 pending an exhaustive enactment of a separate law for the administration of the BBMP during the pendency of the petitions.

He also told the Bench that the State government has written to the Election Commission of India seeking permission to notify the increase in number of wards in view of the model code of conduct in force for the upcoming bylections to the State Legislative Assembly.

However, Senior Advocate K.N. Phanindra, appearing for SEC pointed out to the Bench that it may not be possible to hold elections to the BBMP for one year, as the process of delimitation to carve out 225 new wards will take six months and thereafter, it will take 2 to 3 months to fix reservation, and another 2 to 3 months to prepare new voters’ list.

Mr. Phanindra also told the Bench that the voters’ list of many wards are already prepared based on the recent delimitation process and voters’ list had been printed for publication.

Meanwhile, senior advocate Ravivarma Kumar, appearing for a petitioner, said that as outcome of Census 2021 would be available when by the time the processes of creating new 225 wards, fixing reservation and voters’ list are completed, the government may further postpone election to carry out delimitation of wards as per the census. If allowed, the BBMP would remain under the direct control of the State government for about two years in violation of the constitutional provisions, Mr. Kumar said. Further hearing has been adjourned.

In another PIL related to holding of elections to 5,800 gram panchayats, the Bench asked SEC to take appropriate decision by Friday on the letter by the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj requesting postponement of elections to panchayats citing increasing COVID-19 cases.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-to-examine-implications-of-increasing-wards-on-civic-polls/article32838475.ece

While the State government has announced holiday till October 30 for schools affiliated to the State board, schools affiliated to central boards continue to hold online classes and examinations. What is however irking some parents is that some of the schools are asking them to submit the physical copy of answer scripts.

A parent, whose child is in class eight in a North Bengaluru school affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, said the online examination began on Monday. “We have to send photos of the answer papers once the child finishes the examination. However, we have been told to submit physical copies of the answer scripts as well as it makes it easy for teachers to evaluate. Many teachers complained that the photos were not clear, making it difficult to correct the papers,” the parent added.

Another parent, whose son studies in a school in South Bengaluru affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination, said the school had asked the parents to click pictures of the answer scripts, convert the files into PDF, and mail it to the subject teacher as soon as they complete the test. “They also asked us to drop the papers in a carton box kept at the school, so that it would help teachers evaluate,” a parent said. However, after several parents protested and refused to come to school to drop off the papers, the management relented and said there was no need to bring a copy to school.

151,2020/10/13,JD(S) has a peculiar problem with candidates in R.R. Nagar,"Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituency, which is going to the polls next month, has thrown up a peculiar problem for the Janata Dal (Secular) in terms of candidates ever since it was carved out.

For, candidates fielded by the party since the first election in the constituency in 2008 have been “outsiders” who have deserted the party soon after electoral losses, and in one instance a party man who simply went “missing” before the polls.

In 2008, Hanumantharayappa (whose daughter H. Kusuma is the Congress nominee now in R.R. Nagar), was the JD(S) candidate after he was denied ticket by the Congress. A known supporter of the current KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, he went back to the Congress after the electoral loss.

In 2013, Thimmananjaiah, the party councillor, was given ticket, and according to former Chief Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy, he was “not seen by party workers four days before the elections”. In 2018, it was Ramachandra, a local BJP leader, who contested on the JD(S) symbol, only to later go back to the saffron party.

“Mr. Hanumantharayappa was never really our party leader. After the elections, he came and informed me of his inclination to go back to the Congress. In 2013, though we asked Mr. Thaimmananjaiah, whose brother-in-law Andanappa was our party candidate in Dasarahalli, to desist from contesting, he was adamant. I was told he was not seen by party workers four days before the polls,” he said. He added that Mr. Ramachandra came to the JD(S) because the BJP had denied him ticket.

“Hence, we are looking for leaders from our party who can contest in R.R. Nagar and not those who will go away before or after the polls,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said. “Despite the problem with candidates, the party secured nearly 40,000 votes in 2008, only to increase it to 52,000 votes in 2013 and about 60,000 in 2018. Why should we not contest?”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jds-has-a-peculiar-problem-with-contestants-in-rr-nagar/article32838468.ece

Considering the extent of damage caused to river Vrishabhavathi, the State government must appoint an expert agency like the CSIR National Environmental Engineering Research Institute for taking steps to protect and rejuvenate the waterbody, the Karnataka High Court said on Monday.

If the State government doesn’t show willingness to appoint the agency, the court would issue a direction for appointing an expert agency, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi said. The expert agency should supervise steps to be taken by all the authorities for protecting and rejuvenating the river, the court observed, while directing the State government to inform whether it will appoint such an agency.

Despite the State government, on Sunday, announcing holiday for all schools affiliated to the State board till October 30, several private schools on Monday continued to conduct online classes, violating the Government Order.

The school managements stated that they had not received any order in writing from the Department of Primary and Secondary Education to stop online classes, and added they cannot discontinue online classes because they have already lost out on several academic days due to COVID-19. The managements defended their decision saying many of them began online classes in July end, and are finding it difficult to complete the portions.

School management members also point out that many are insisting that they conduct online classes so that their children are engaged and are not idle.

Suma S., parent of a class six student in a State syllabus school in Rajajinagar, said her son continued to have online classes for three hours on Monday. “We have no problem if the classes are continued as the teachers take longer to complete the portions during online classes than physical classes,” she said.

Although the department had announced a revised syllabus where 30% of the portions were cut, it was withdrawn due to controversies and the new revised syllabus is yet to be announced. This, teachers say, has forced them to teach all the chapters.

Shashi Kumar D., general secretary of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said they were waiting for the department to issue an official order. He said they would instruct the school managements to stop synchronous classes, but said that schools wanted to continue pre-recorded classes. “Students and parents can view these classes at any time of the day. These classes will be revision of the lessons taught by the teachers before and not new lessons,” he said.

Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said they continued to hold online classes on Monday as the teachers had planned academic activities for the week, which included oral tests. He said barring about a dozen parents, the rest wanted online classes to be continued on Monday. He said the school had decided to give students a one-week break during Dasara. He also pointed out that many parents would refuse to pay the second term fees if online classes were not conducted during October.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6fdd0q/article32838434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGONLINECLASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/many-pvt-schools-affiliated-to-state-syllabus-continue-to-hold-online-classes/article32838435.ece
154,2020/10/13,Flying schools to help better utilise well-equipped North Karnataka airports,"The recent announcement by the Airports Authority of India on setting up flying schools in six underutilised airports across India, including two in Kalaburagi and Belagavi in the State, to meet the growing demand for pilots in the country has triggered new hopes of better use of the two well-equipped airports. The new proposal is also expected to contribute to the development of the North Karnataka region.

Built on 742 acres near Srinivas Saradagi village, about 12 km from Kalaburagi, the Kalaburagi airport is one of the biggest in India, having the 10th longest runway (3,175x45 metres) and the second longest in the State after Bengaluru. The total length of the airfield is 7.5 km and its terminal building is spread on 2,173 sq.m.

Sambra airport in Belagavi too is well-equipped to house a flying school, say officials. It is spread over 730 acres and at 2.5 km, its runway is one of the biggest in the country. This enables not only civilian flights, but also large cargo aircraft to take off and land. The airport is equipped with state-of-the-art navigation and communication equipment. Work on installing a localiser and setting up a glide-path is in progress.

Minor tweaks

Kalaburagi airport director S. Gnaneswara Rao said the airport can operate bigger flights and house a flying school as well. “Some minor arrangements, such as the construction of hangers for parking and maintaining the aircraft, are to be made. These things are normally taken care of by the flying schools themselves,” he said.

Though administrative approval was given in March 2007 for Kalaburagi and the foundation stone was laid only next year, it took 10 years for this to be completed in 2018 after crossing many deadlines. Formally inaugurated on November 22 last year, the airport has remained underutilised with only two flights operating between Kalaburagi and Bengaluru.

Officials at Sambra hope to address some pending issues in quick time. For instance, the instrument-landing facility has been installed but not commissioned yet. That is because there are two thoroughfare roads on the airport premises that are used by residents of Honnihal and Mavinakatti.

Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath said the district administration would provide an alternative road to the kutcha roads. “The government has acquired around six acres of land to build new roads for the residents. That work will be sped up,” he said.

“Setting up a flying school has been a long-pending demand. Once the flying school is opened here, it will boost economic activity and thus contribute to the development of our region. It will also positively influence and encourage our local students to become pilots,” Umesh Jadhav, Lok Sabha member from Kalaburagi, said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wkqe1l/article32838412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGSAMBRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/flying-schools-to-help-better-utilise-well-equipped-north-karnataka-airports/article32838413.ece
155,2020/10/13,A COVID-proof plan for Malleswaram’s festivities,"Come festive season, thousands throng the commercial areas in Malleswaram, especially 8th Cross. However, this poses a huge risk in spread of COVID-19.

To ensure this does not happen, Malleswaram Urban Living Lab (MULL), a collaborative effort between Malleswaram Social, a citizens’ group, and Sensing Local, a do-tank with focus on improving the state of environment and public health, has come out with a “Malleswaram 8th Cross Festival Plan”.

According to a representative, who worked on the initiative, volunteers surveyed the commercial hub and mapped different kinds of establishments, between September 30 and October 2. While there were nearly 200 street vendors, there were 77 shops. “We conducted surveys and spoke to vendors and shop owners/keepers about the challenges they faced and whether they were able to follow protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” the representative said, adding that while there seemed to be a high level of concern among shop owners, it was lower, among street vendors.

While social distancing regulating number of people, displaying awareness material, temperature checks, and hand sanitation were challenges faced by shop owners, for street vendors, contactless payment took precedence. However, the biggest concern for owners was customers not complying with safety measures, especially wearing masks. On the other hand, the biggest concern for street vendors was financial, given that the number of customers had dropped.

“We realised that interventions were necessary to fill the gaps in safety measures – regulating people, temperature checks, markings/ barriers to ensure social distancing, hand sanitation facilities and display of awareness material,” the representative said, adding that the need of the hour was to prepare for the inevitable and prevent the dangers of overcrowding, given that it will be impossible to prevent the influx of vendors and customers.

MULL worked out two options – demarcating pedestrian-only zones, clearing pavements to allow free movement, moving vendors to a location where they can space out, and creating vending zones for the festival. Under the first option, apart from pedestrianising 8th Cross, smaller pedestrian zones could be created at East Park Road and West Park Road. Traffic could be restricted in the conservancies. This would help accommodate existing and additional vendors. Under the second option, vendors could be relocated to East and West Park Roads, and conservancies.

“An overwhelming majority of vendors and shop owners we spoke to said they were willing to support such initiatives,” the representative told The Hindu. They had data to demonstrate that these options could be implemented on ground, even if temporarily, during the festival season. “We have submitted our report to Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who is also Malleswaram MLA. We plan on sharing it with the BBMP Commissioner and Administrator as well,” the representative said, pointing out that the same blueprint could be applied to other traditional markets areas in the city such as Gandhi Bazaar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2v5t5a/article32838339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGMARKETP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-covid-proof-plan-for-malleswarams-festivities/article32838340.ece
156,2020/10/13,High Court order a respite for govt.,"Congress, BJP say no clean chit

The State government appeared to have received a respite from a season of unfavourable news on Tuesday with the Kerala High Court slapping a two-month stay on the CBI inquiry into the contentious Life Mission-UAE Red Crescent contract to build and deliver 140 dwellings for low-income families at Wadakkanchery in Thrissur.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the interim order vindicated the government’s position that Life Mission had no role in the award of the contract to any particular builder.

He dismissed the contention of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that the High Court had refused to grant the government a clean chit.

The High Court had upheld the government’s argument that the CBI had “erred” in registering a case against “anonymous” Life Mission officials under the provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010. The court also saw merit in the government’s averment that Life Mission did not accept foreign aid from the sponsor.

Mr. Vijayan said the Congress and the BJP were birds of the same feather. They had in tandem attempted to lay down a smokescreen of lies to discredit the government’s flagship programme to provide free housing for the poor.

The government had soaked up a seemingly relentless cycle of adverse publicity after court documents revealed that the UAE consulate linked gold smuggling case accused had profited hugely from the Life Mission project.

The Opposition parties had repeatedly accused Mr. Vijayan of using the heft of his office to aid the economic offenders. Left Democratic Front (LDF) covener A Vijayaraghavan welcomed the verdict and hoped it would shut the mouth of the Opposition and their enablers in the mainstream media.

However, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Mr. Vijayan’s sense of victory was misplaced and fleeting. The High Court had rejected the government’s plea to quash the FIR filed by the CBI. The judge had given a reprieve to the government merely for technical reasons.

BJP State president K. Surendran said the court had allowed the CBI to forge ahead with its probe into the FCRA violation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4pkyzi/article32412177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KERALAHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/high-court-order-a-respite-for-govt/article32848082.ece
157,2020/10/13,Islamic scholars turn to wayside vending,"Many lost jobs after mosques, madrasas shut down following the pandemic outnreak

Dozens of Islamic scholars who lost jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic in the wake of the shutting down of mosques and madrasas have turned to roadside vending.

Turbaned men in milky white dhoti and full-sleeved shirts are the latest to join the roadside vendor bandwagon across the State. Several of them have been seen selling fried banana chips in solitary corners of State and national highways.

“I cannot let my family starve any longer. Somehow I managed for three months after I lost my madrasa teaching job in a Palakkad village in June. I started selling chips on the roadside a week ago, and I’m happy I can make a living with this,” said Mohammed Jamsheed Saqafi.

Like him, dozens of young Saqafis, Ahsanis, Faizis, Hudavis, and Wafis (scholars carrying surnames linking with their alma mater) have turned to roadside selling for a living. Some are selling baked and fried items, some vegetables and fruits, some floor carpets, some pickles and papad, and some biriyani. And all of them turned to roadside vending as a desperate measure to survive.

Some madrasa teachers joined hands and started making banana chips near Kizhisseri. Mr. Jamsheed said he would collect the chips supplied by the teacher group and sell it at a convenient place. He was found near Puzhakkattiri on Tuesday.

“I could sell nearly 16 kg chips a day. Alhamdu Lillah (meaning thank God), I’m happy,” he said.

Motorists passing by often find curiosity in these white-clad men. “I’m sure I will get quality stuff. And in a way helping them to make a living as well,” said Mohammed Ali, a businessman who stopped to procure five kg tapioca from a madrasa teacher at Malappuram.

According to Jamal Karulai, a social worker and district leader of Sunni Yuvajana Sangham, the economic crisis has opened up new vistas of livelihood for young religious scholars. “There’s Izzat (pride) in doing any job,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cgo026/article32848042.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmpm-Madrasa-teacher,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/islamic-scholars-turn-to-wayside-vending/article32848036.ece

160,2020/10/13,Blue alert as water crosses rule curve level,"KSEB decides to increase power generation in Idukki to reduce water level

The district administration issued a blue alert in the wake of the water level in the Idukki reservoir crossing 2,390.85 ft on Tuesday. With an increased spell of rainfall in the catchment areas, the water level was near to the blue alert level for the past two days.

The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) sounded the blue alert with the water level reaching 2,391.18 ft in the morning. It was 86.41% of the storage level.

The blue alert level for the day as per the new rule curve level fixed by the Central Water Commission (CWC) was 2,390.85 ft. An orange alert will be issued before October 20 if the water level reaches 2,396.85 ft and a red alert at 2397.85 ft. The full reservoir level is 2,403 ft.

The present water level is higher than the level recorded on the same day in the previous two years. The change in monsoon pattern is also evident as the catchment area recorded above normal rainfall in the first and second week of October.

A power position meeting of the KSEB on Tuesday decided to increase generation from 5 mu to 10 mu at the Moolamattom powerhouse to reduce the water level in the reservoir.

The Idukki reservoir is mainly reserved for power generation when the demand in the State escalates during summer season. The generation which remained below normal was raised to 5 mu from 3.2 mu on Monday.

The KSEB wants to avoid a situation of opening the dam shutters as in the case of the 2018 floods and keep the water level below the new rule curve level. With the increased power generation, water level will fall in the coming days. The Dam Monitoring and Research Station is monitoring the situation, an official said.

The power position meeting also decided to surrender power from the Central pool and instead use the power generated at Moolamattom. The present situation does not warrant opening of the dam shutters as the water level remained over 10 ft short of the FRL level. The shutters need to be raised only if there is extremely high rainfall in the coming days, the possibility of which is remote considering the weather predictions, the official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/blue-alert-as-water-crosses-rule-curve-level/article32847831.ece

Volunteers will be monitoring the patients shifted to the centres due to the lack of home care facilities and local bodies will ensure that they are provided medicine, food and tele consultation. The Minister also instructed the district administration not to close any FLTCs currently operating in Kollam.

Since shop owners, merchants and autorickshaw drivers are increasingly contracting the infection, special groups will be formed for them as part of containment. “Sector officers and ward-level committees should monitor the groups and if necessary, doctors should be assigned at panchayat level. Sector officers should be given the responsibility of keeping a tab on ward-level activities and volunteers,” she said. The Minister also urged the public to cooperate with the officials and ensured that more FLTCs will be opened in panchayats that report high number of cases. “Joint efforts of people’s representatives, volunteers, and sector officers will help us to enforce containment activities in a more efficient manner and prevent further spread,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/surge-in-kollam-caseload-at-907/article32846479.ece

The court directed the Special Government Pleader and the Standing Counsel for the University Grants Commission to inform the court whether the open university had obtained the necessary recognition from the UGC for the educational programmes.

On a question from the court whether the government had approached the UGC for necessary recognition for the university to start functioning, the Special Prosecutor sought time to file the reply.

The UGC provisions stipulates that that no higher educational institutions shall offer distance learning programme or other online programmes and admit leaders without obtaining the commission recognition. The UGC also stipulates that admissions shall not be made by educational institutions in anticipation of the recognition.

Referring to these provisions, the court noted that unless the recognition was granted to the open university, the transfer of students and staff from other universities to the new one could prejudicial to them, if the recognition was refused in future.

Shinos Rahman, one of the directors of Vasanthi, which won the best film award at the Kerala State Film Awards this year, was probably taken by surprise by the declaration. He was one of the three petitioners who had recently filed a writ petition at the Kerala High Court accusing the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy of nepotism. They also alleged that the academy had rushed through the screening process for the awards.

Plea dismissed

169,2020/10/13,Lijo’s remarkable talent to the fore in Jallikkattu,"The best director award was almost a foregone conclusion

Lijo Jose Pellissery has come a long way since making his debut with Nayakan in 2010. During the last one decade, not many Malayalam directors have made as much an impact nationally and internationally.

He has deserved all the laurels that have come his way. His latest triumph came on Tuesday when he won the State Award for the best director.

It was almost a foregone conclusion. For, Jallikkattu is not just an exceptional film. it is totally a director’s film. It has a promising premise and a fine script yes, but in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, it wouldn’t have become such a stunning visual experience.

The film – it is basically about a buffalo getting away from the slaughter house and how it is hunted down by the villagers but is also about the beast inside man – earned praise from a global audience. Few Indian films of late have been made with such vision and craft.

Wide acclaim

It was his previous film, Ee.Ma.Yau, that earned him respect from people outside Malayalam cinema. The dark film about a funeral had won Lijo the Silver Peacock Award for the best director at the International Film Festival of India in 2018. Remarkably, he won the honours again for Jallikkattu at last year’s festival, too.

Lijo’s talent had been noticed by the Malayali viewer long ago. Amen (2013), a critical and commercial success, established him as a director to watch out for. It didn’t take him long to be recognised as one of the finest directors of his generation in Indian cinema.

“Lijo’s growth as a director after Amen has been amazing,” said Pradeep Nair, a National Award-winning director who follows world cinema closely. “I don’t think no other director has brought him as much global attention to Malalayalam cinema.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ciegri/article32849923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TVLIJO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lijos-remarkable-talent-to-the-fore-in-jallikkattu/article32845701.ece
170,2020/10/13,Land being acquired for bridge across Pampa,"Bridge to connect Kavalam and Thattassery in Kuttanad

Authorities have expedited the process of acquiring land for constructing a bridge across the Pampa river connecting Kavalam and Thattassery in Kuttanad.

A survey to fix the boundary of the land to be acquired for the project has begun. According to officials, around 1.45 acre of land in 51 survey numbers in Kavalam and Kunnumma villages will have to be acquired for the project.

Earlier this year, the process of acquiring land for the bridge came to a halt after an inspection found that some of the land needed for the project was missing from the notification issued. However, a meeting chaired by District Collector A. Alexander in September decided to initiate immediate steps to acquire the land. Further, a fresh notification was issued.

In 2016, the State government allocated ₹30 crore for the construction of the bridge and approach road. The estimate was later revised to ₹51.5 crore following changes made in the design. The original plan was to acquire the land through direct negotiated purchase. However, some landowners demanded a change in the alignment.

As the alignment was fixed by the Inland Waterways Authority, officials rejected their demand. Later, the Revenue Department ended the move to acquire land through negotiated purchase.

Following this, in November 2018 the department announced that the Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act would be invoked to acquire land for the construction of the bridge and the landowners were given time till December 1, 2018, to hand over the consent letters. However, the authorities failed to take follow-up action until the turn of this year.

The bridge will connect the Alappuzha-Changanassery (AC) road and Main Central (MC) road. It will help reduce the distance between Alappuzha and Kottayam by around 9 km along with opening the doors of development to the remote areas of Kuttanad. Once constructed, the bridge and approach road will be 396.21-metres-long. The bridge and walkway together will have a width of 11 metres.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/land-being-acquired-for-bridge-across-pampa/article32845694.ece
171,2020/10/13,"Kani has proved her mettle, time and again","Kani Kusruti adds State best actor award to her bag of achievements

Kani Kusruti has been a presence, on stage and on screen, for around two decades now. Even then, it is in Sajin Baabu’s Biriyani, which fetched her the best actor (female) award at this year’s Kerala State Film Awards, that she is playing a full-length lead role in film for the first time. Yet, she has been very much active in the acting circuit, performing with acclaimed theatre groups abroad or playing notable roles in films and short films.

One of those short films The Discreet Charm of the Savarnas, which has garnered much praise when it began streaming in YouTube last week, has her playing the role of a privileged independent filmmaker, who along with two other filmmakers, is looking for an actor who “looks like a Dalit.” Last week, she also won the best actress award at the fifth BRICS festival, which was held along with the 42nd Moscow International Film Festival (MIFF).

Dedicated to P.K. Rosy

“I would like to dedicate these awards to P.K. Rosy, the Dalit actor who was driven away from the industry for playing the role of an upper caste woman. I still see the same issues around me, of how several brilliant actors are facing discrimination and do not get any offers due to their colour or caste. I am also dedicating this award to the actor who had to face sexual assault and against whom insensitive comments are being made. I have much respect for the likes of Parvathy for standing up for her,” says Kani in an interview to The Hindu.

In Biriyani, she plays a woman struggling hard to survive in a deeply religious, patriarchal society.

“When Sajin finished viewing the edits, he had told me that it is a performance which could win awards. But I did not take that seriously, as the past year had so many great performances in Malayalam cinema,” she says.

Beginnings in theatre

Beginning her acting career right from her school days, she began her stint in theatre with Thiruvananthapuram-based Abhinaya. After attending the theatre arts programme at the Drama School in Thrissur, she pursued physical theatre at L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in Paris. She has acted in several Malayalam films, including Kerala Cafe, Cocktail, Shikkar and North 24 Kaatham.

She recently won the second best actress at the Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and was also nominated for the best actor award at the Tribeca Festival in New York for her performance in Prashant Nair’s Tryst with Destiny.

“A television series that I acted in Hindi, Ok Computer, will start streaming soon.

172,2020/10/13,"Jail superintendent, two others suspended","Death of an accused at quarantine centre

District jail superintendent and two other prison officers were placed under suspension pending inquiry in connection with the death of an accused in the ganja case at Ambilikala hostel, the quarantine centre of the jail department.

Superintendent Raju Abraham has been placed under suspension as he should have been more vigilant in avoiding such malpractices in the quarantine centre of the department, according to Jail DGP Rishiraj Singh.

Two prison officers A.R. Ramesh and M.S. Arun, who were allegedly involved in the torture of Shemeer, an accused in a ganja case; and a 17-year-old boy, arrested for vehicle theft; were placed under suspension. Shemeer later died at the Thrissur Medical College Hospital,

Two other jail officers, who were on duty on the day Shemeer died, were transferred earlier. The two officers, who have been placed under suspension, were involved in both cases. The DGP has asked to close down Ambilikala, the quarantine centre. Now onwards three blocks in the district jail, which lay vacant, will be used as quarantine centre for prisoners.

The disciplinary action was taken on the basis of DGP’s visit to Ambilikkala COVID care centre, Viyyur sub jail and Juvenile home at Ramavarmapuram, where the minor boy, who was alleged torture, was shifted. Mr. Singh collected statements from the other complainants too.

Further action in Shemeer’s case will be taken after receiving the post-mortem report, the DGP said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hu7n35/article32850106.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20201013163001,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jail-superintendent-two-others-suspended/article32845591.ece
173,2020/10/13,HC stays CBI probe into LIFE Mission project,"Case for FCRA violation on a complaint by Anil Akkara

The CBI probe into the alleged Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) violation in the acceptance of funds from the UAE-based Red Crescent for the Wadakkanchery LIFE Mission housing project was stayed by the Kerala High Court for two months.

The order was passed on a petition moved by U. V. Jose, the Chief Executive Officer of the Mission.

In his judgment, Justice V.G. Arun noted that the provisions of the FCRA and the materials on record did not justify arraying the petitioner as the accused in the case.

The CBI had booked the case for FCRA violation on a complaint by Anil Akkara, the Congress MLA representing Wadakkanchery Assembly Constituency.

Petitioner’s contention

The counsel for the petitioner had contended that the complaint in the case did not make out even a prima facie case and the hasty manner in which the crime was registered indicated a deliberate attempt to malign the State government.

He also contended that the allegations in the complaint, even if accepted in their entirety, were inadequate to implicate the petitioner or other officials of the Mission.

The order

In his order, the judge noted that “undisputedly, LIFE Mission has not received any foreign contribution directly from the sponsor. The amount received by Unitac Builders and Developers and Sane Ventures LLP, in terms of the agreement entered between them and the foreign source being towards the cost in lieu of goods or services rendered in the ordinary course of business, is exempted” from the Section 3 of the Act, which deals with prohibition from accepting foreign contribution.

A careful perusal of the Section shows that the prohibition against acceptance of foreign contribution is applicable only to the categorises specification under the Sub Section (1) of the Section 3 of the Act. The contention that Life Mission would fall under Section 3 (1) (c) is liable to be rejected on a plain reading of the Section and by applying the ejusdem generis (of the same kind) rule, the judge noted.

Hence LIFE Mission or the builders do not fall under any of the categories enumerated on Section 3 (1), the court ordered.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-stays-cbi-probe-into-life-mission-project/article32845440.ece
174,2020/10/13,Chemists’ forum to roll out drugs from Nov. 1,"Nearly 90% of the drugs being sold in Kerala are being brought from outside the State. Most of the few pharmaceutical units left here are sinking too.

The All-Kerala Chemists and Druggists Association (AKCDA), the largest network of medicine distributors in the State, is planning to tap this market by launching its own drug manufacturing facility.

AKCDA president A.N. Mohanan said on Tuesday that high raw material costs and the steps taken to ensure quality, among other things, were affecting the prospects of drug manufacturing units here. “We hope that we can tackle these issues using our industry experience and good will,” he said.

Ten products, including hand sanitizer, disinfectant, and essential drugs such as paracetamol tablets are expected to be rolled out on November 1 on the occasion of Keralappiravi Day (State Formation Day). In the second year, the company would start manufacturing drugs for lifestyle diseases, he said.

The facility

The manufacturing facility of the company titled Kaino Pharm Ltd. has been set up on the campus of a pharmacy college run by the AKCDA in Ernakulam district.

Ravi S. Menon, former State Drugs Controller, is one of the directors of the company, which has tied up with a Thrissur-based pharmaceutical unit for the production of drugs.

“The drug sales in the State a year are worth around ₹12,000 crore. In the initial year, our target is to have business for ₹100 crore,” Mr. Mohanan said.

The drugs could be made available at cheap rates as the AKCDA itself was manufacturing and distributing them without the involvement of middlemen, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chemists-forum-to-roll-out-drugs-from-nov-1/article32845371.ece
175,2020/10/13,Rift in JD(S) and NCP flusters LDF,"Pala Assembly seat to be bone of contention if KC(M) joins front

The tug of war between the Malabar and Central Travancrore lobbies of the Janata Dal (Secular) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) appears to be giving a headache for the ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front ( LDF) during the fag end of its term in Kerala.

At least two recent developments have emerged within these constituents of the LDF even foreshadowing a split in these small parties. The dissolution of the State unit of the JD(S) and the subsequent replacement of its president C. K. Nanu, MLA, by Mathew T. Thomas, MLA, with an ad hoc committee by party president H.D. Deva Gowda has not gone well with the Malabar faction.

In the fierce rivalry between the factions last year, Mr. Thomas was forced to quit his ministerial berth and K. Krishnankutty occupied that post and the octogenarian Mr. Nanu became president of the party which has three legislators.

Now Mr. Krishnankutty has his own preferences though he visibly shows allegiance to the Nanu faction, sources said.

Another trouble is the noticeable crisis brewing in the NCP with a section led by Mani C. Kappan, MLA, opposing the electoral understanding the LDF plans to have with Kerala Congress(M)-led by Jose K. Mani and offer the Pala segment to Mr. Mani. Mr. Kappan is representing the segment now. At present, the NCP has only two legislators, including Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran, after the demise of Thomas Chandy from Kuttanad in December last.

Both the JD(S) and the NCP, though have no big stakes in the State's polity, the LDF has offered Assembly seats and accommodated with a ministerial berth each, considering their influence in some pocket boroughs. The ruling CPI(M) would not want to shed its proposed political association with Mr. Mani even if it is at the cost of a split in the NCP as a section led by Mr. Saseendran enjoys the support of the Chief Minister, the sources said.

At the same time, the LDF will have to accommodate its nascent partner, the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), which has solid grassroots support despite having no legislators. Incidentally a section of the LJD led by its State president M. V. Shreyams Kumar is strongly in favour of the proposed merger with the JDS). But many fear that the merger would be disastrous if the JD(S) in Karnataka aligns with the BJP as the secret talks held between JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa last month already assumed political colours.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rift-in-jds-and-ncp-flusters-ldf/article32845259.ece

Union Minister for Surface Transport Nithin Gadkari inaugurated the construction work of the Cheruthoni bridge across the Periyar on the downstream of Idukki reservoir on Tuesday.

The unveiling of the plaque was done through a video conference, attended by Governor Arif Muhammed Khan and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

Speaking at the function Mr. Gadkari applauded the initiatives taken by the State government for the construction of national highways. He said the State was facing problems with regard to acquiring land for national highway development.

However, the government took special interest in such projects and was succeeding in it. He also noted that Mr. Vijayan and Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran had met him many times to discuss the problems related to land acquisition. The new bridge at Cheruthoni is constructed as part of the national highway.

Mr. Vijayan said the bridge constructed at a cost of ₹24 crore would withstand the floods. It was expected that the construction would be completed in 18 months. He said that national highways were required for the development of the State and the Central government was giving full support to the initiatives.

The new bridge will connect Puliyanmala-Thodupuzha State highway with the Neryamaganlam road. In the 2018 floods, the water overflowed through the low-lying bridge (chappathu) constructed as part of the Idukki dam project at Cheriuthoni town.

The traffic was allowed through it only after verification by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) engineers on the extent of the damage.

The low-lying bridge withstood the heavy flow of water from the Cheruthoni dam and a large stock of the rocks were deposited on its upstream areas in the floods.. Only one-way traffic is possible through the bridge.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cheruthoni-bridge-work-begins/article32845097.ece
177,2020/10/13,AICTE constitutes panel for engineers Bill,"Union Minister writes to MP who had raised the issue in Parliament

Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal has informed K. Somaprasad, MP, that the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has constituted a committee for preparing the Professional Engineers Bill.

The committee will function under the chairmanship of M.S. Ananth, former director, IIT Mardas, he said in a letter sent to the MP who had raised the matter in Rajya Sabha during a special mention demanding a professional regulatory mechanism in engineering field.

Mr. Somaprasad had pointed out that though there were 10,396 engineering institutes in India approved by the AICTE at present, only few were imparting quality education.

“Others are mere factories producing unemployable engineers. The AICTE is the only statutory body for the promotion of quality in technical education and the maintenance of norms and standards in technical education in India. There is no professional or statutory council to check and measure the professional ethics of engineers,” he said in his appeal.

Observing that several statutory councils such as the Medical Council of India (MCI), Indian Nursing Council (INC), Pharmacy Council of India (PCI) and Dental Council of India (DCI) in India were there, he said that establishing a statutory and professional Engineering Council of India was necessary.

“Engineering is by far the largest segment of Indian industry. India’s engineering industry accounts for 27% of the total factories in the industrial sector. The engineering sector gets around 63% of share through foreign collaborations. Apart from this, India has a huge opportunity within engineering services also. Among developing countries, India offers the best combination of low cost, availability of skills and manpower for the engineering sector. Engineers working in any sector or as entrepreneurs have to play a great role in developing India,” he said.

He said that subject about the lack of regulatory mechanism in the field was raised after consulting experts such as Principal Advisor to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation E. Sreedharan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/aicte-constitutes-panel-for-engineers-bill/article32844887.ece

Kerala Karshaka Sangham (KKS) State secretary K.N. Balagopal inaugurated the district-level harvesting of various crops cultivated by the farmer’s body.

KKS had started farming in more than 2,000 acres of fallow land in the district and the harvest festival was held at the Kummil polder in Kadakkal. The farmers had cultivated paddy in 900 acres of land under the supervision of KKS area and village committees.

Majority of the farmers from the district participated in the extensive drive launched by the sangham as part of Subhiksha Keralam, an initiative of the government to make the State self -reliant in food production. Banana was cultivated in 310 acres of land while various intermediary crops including tapioca were planted in 47 acres. Around 25,000 KSS members now have kitchen gardens at their homes and they have also been promoting vegetable and fish farming in the district.

In connection with Subhiksha Keralam, various local bodies and department had also started cultivation of paddy and vegetables in the district. Animal Husbandry Department, Dairy Development Department and Fisheries department had announced different projects that includes fodder grass cultivation, pearl spot farming, and biofloc units.

The district had 3,393 hectares of fallow land and the project aims to convert the maximum area into farm land. KSS district president Biju K.

Highway projects worth ₹50,000 crore are being developed in Kerala as part of the Mumbai-Kanyakumari economic corridor under Bharatmala Pariyojana, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Tuesday.

He was speaking at a virtual ceremony for the laying of foundation stones for seven highway projects worth ₹11,571 crore for Kerala and inauguration of a 27-kilometre highway project from Kazhakoottam to Mukkola, built at a cost of ₹1,121 crore.

The Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs minister said that in line with the Prime Minister’s vision for a New India, development of world-class transport infrastructure has been prioritised through initiatives such as the Bharatmala Pariyojana, the country’s largest ever infrastructure development programme.

In addition, there are plans to upgrade 119 kilometres of port connectivity roads under Bharatmala/ Sagarmala Scheme, he said.

Flagship corridors such as Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, Delhi-Amritsar Katra Expressway, Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway are also being developed as part of the Bharatmala Pariyojana, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said in a statement.

“Mumbai—Kanyakumari Economic Corridor with a length of 1,760 kilometres is one such corridor being developed as a part of the Bharatmala Pariyojana,” he said.

He noted that the corridor improving connectivity to the entire western coast of the country from Mumbai till Kanyakumari will greatly enable the economic prosperity of the region.

“As a part of the Mumbai—Kanyakumari Economic Corridor, 23 projects with a length of 650 kilometres are being developed in the State of Kerala at an investment of ₹50,000 crore,” the Minister said.

He also said that the corridor traversing the entire length of Kerala from North to South is expected to be the lifeline of Kerala. The corridor improves connectivity to major cities/ towns such as Kasargod, Thalassery, Kannur, Kozhikode, Ernakulam, Kochi, Alappuzha, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram.

According to the Minister, works have been sanctioned and construction is being initiated in another seven projects of length 177 kilometres at an investment of ₹11,571 crore.

It includes construction of high level bridge at Cheruthoni River, which was damaged/ approaches completely washed off due to natural calamities during southwest monsoon season during June 1 to August 19 ,2018.

He said the government is committed to ensure expedited completion of these projects to enable economic prosperity of the State and that the projects will change the face of Kerala.

Bharatmala Pariyojana was conceptualised through a scientific study of freight traffic movement between key origin-destination pairs to enable efficient freight and passenger movement.

Mr. Gadkari said that 35,000 kilometres of national highways are being developed as a part of it in the country and out of this, 1,234 kilometres are being developed in Kerala.

Presently, he said that Kerala has national highways of 1,782-kilometre length and 488-kilometre length of national highways have been constructed during 2014-20 period, which is an increase of 569 per cent over 2009-14 period.

The expenditure on construction of national highway from 2014-2020 is ₹3,820 crore while another ₹671 crore was spent on maintenance of national highways in the State.

Mr. Gadkari also said that works costing ₹19,800 crore are targeted for completion by 2024 while 30 projects of an aggregate length of 549 kilometres for an amount of ₹5,327 crore are under implementation.

He asked Chief Minister Pinarai Vijayan to consider PPP (Public Private Partnership) model for road development which will bring more capital in building infrastructure.

Mentioning about very high land acquisition cost for roads in Kerala, Mr. Gadkari called for making aggregates and sand royalty free and for exempting other road materials like iron/ steel, cement from State GST that will be very helpful to Kerala for reducing the cost of oad construction.

Mr. Gadkari also invited the chief minister for a detailed discussion on these issues.

Further, Mr. Gadkari asked the State to identify black spots on highways and offered help in rectifying the same. He reiterated that safer roads are important to reduce accidents and save lives.

Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways V.K. Singh said Mumbai-Kanyakumari project will improve connectivity to some of the major cities like Kozhikode, Ernakulam and Kollam.

180,2020/10/13,Swapna gets default bail in money laundering case,"Her bail application in UAPA case booked by NIA will come up for hearing on October 15.

Swapna Suresh, an accused in a case booked by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act , was allowed default bail as the agency could not file the chargesheet within 60 days of arresting her.

She had earlier secured bail in a case booked by the Customs.

Her bail application in a case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), booked by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), will come up for hearing on October 15.

Thought the ED contended that she was not entitled to default bail, the Special Court concerned refused to accept the argument.

Upholding the right of the accused for default bail, Kauser Edappagath, Principal Sessions Judge, Ernakulam, held that it was an indefeasible right.

The petitioner had exercised her right on time and had satisfied all the requirements for obtaining default bail, the judge noted.

On the first day of the hearing of the bail application, her counsel Geo Paul orally submitted that he was seeking default bail. The objection filed by the ED to the bail application showed that it had also treated the application as one for default bail, the court noted.

Personal liberty, which deprived when bail is refused, is too precious. The court has to zealously guard the fundamental rights of personal liberty as guaranteed by the Constitution. The significance and sweep of Article 21 of the Constitution makes deprivation of liberty a matter of grave concern, the judge noted.

Personal liberty

Personal liberty of an accused or convict can be deprived only by procedure established by law.

The court has to see whether the deprivation of personal liberty has the sanction of procedure established by law, if there is legal justification for the detention, the judge noted.

The court owes a duty to the accused and is commanded by Article 21 of the Constitution and provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure to release an accused on bail if he is prepared to and furnishes bail in a case where the investigation is not completed and final report not filed within the specified period, the order said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/e1juu5/article32798555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th07-devesh-ED-G5V7R8AQG3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/swapana-gets-bail-in-ed-case/article32841313.ece

182,2020/10/13,Denial of treatment to pregnant women to invite stringent action,"Kannur District Collector T.V. Subhash has warned private hospitals of stringent action, if they deny treatment to pregnant women affected by COVID-19.

The Collector, who is also the Chairman of the District Disaster Management Authority, pointed out that there had been an increasing tendency among private hospitals to refer pregnant woman testing positive for the virus to government hospitals.

The system cannot accommodate such cases in the event of a surge, and there is a possibility of the public health-care system finding it difficult to handle them. In such situations, it will be tough to treat COVID-19 patients in serious condition, he observed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/denial-of-treatment-to-pregnant-women-to-invite-stringent-action/article32838939.ece
183,2020/10/13,GST compensation: States mulling legal remedy,"Kerala argues that recompense disbursal cannot be postponed

Kerala and eight other States will jointly approach the Supreme Court if the Centre goes ahead and allow States to borrow up to ₹1.1 lakh crore from a special window facilitated by the Reserve Bank of India as mooted by Centre for paying out this year’s compensation on account of the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

Responding to the GST Council’s failure to reach a consensus over the issue of how States will be compensated for their revenue shortfall, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said the Centre was stubborn on its stance and the council meeting held online dispersed without taking a decision.

The States were told that they can borrow ₹1.1 lakh crore loan of the ₹2.3 lakh crore GST compensation this year. At least ₹50,000 crore will be received from the compensation cess this year and the balance later. Dr. Isaac said nine of the 10 States that had been opposing the two options mooted by Centre for GST compensation were against this move. “Maharashtra seems to have switched sides as their Finance Minister did not turn up,” he said.

The Finance Minister said the Centre availing itself of the loan to disburse GST compensation was practical and easy and Kerala strongly argued that the disbursal of the GST compensation could not be postponed. “Why cannot the Centre that agreed to increase the loan to be borrowed from ₹97,000 crore to ₹1.1 lakh crore enhance it further. What prevents them?” he asked.

If the Centre did not want voting, Dr. Isaac said they could constitute a subcommittee of State Finance Ministers and decide. The States that stood with Kerala were ready to discuss the new options of the subcommittee and reach a decision.

But, Dr. Isaac said the Centre did not agree to these suggestions and the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was for arriving at a consensus. West Bengal and Chhattisgarh strongly opposed the Centre’s move while Assam and Goa wanted permission to avail themselves of the loan without the GST Council taking a decision.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/bxhm9k/article32831056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI12212017000228B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gst-compensation-states-mulling-legal-remedy/article32838812.ece
184,2020/10/13,Row over Charachira pond work,"Eco-activists say water sources cut off and walkway encroaches on the pond

The city Corporation's ongoing pond renovation work at Charachira has not gone down well with environmentalist groups, who are of the opinion that works will only lead to the eventual destruction of the pond. But the Corporation authorities maintain that it is part of the civic body’s initiatives at protecting water bodies that are facing destruction.

The Corporation has taken up a ₹3.25 crore project as part of the People’s Plan programme to renovate the pond with a walkway, boating facilities, fish farming and swimming facilities. One of the major bones of contention is the walkway around the pond. The work on the walkway along three sides of the pond has been completed. Environmentalists say that the construction has reduced the area of the pond as well as cut off the water sources to it.

“The walkway has been constructed by encroaching into the pond for a few metres. Two water sources used to drain into the pond, from the Nanthencode side and from the Raj Bhavan side. Both these have now been cut off, because of which the pond has not filled up much even after so much rain. Also, a lot of construction waste and soil has been dumped to one side of the pond. The question now is whether the Corporation can reverse this or open the water sources into the pond to maintain the health of the water body and retain it as an ecological-friendly area by planting enough trees by the side. Water bodies can be protected as they are without any construction activities,” says Veena Maruthoor, an environmentalist.

Good intentions

But the city Corporation authorities point at the pond revival works that the civic body has taken up in different wards to say that it has only good intentions in taking up the work at Charachira.

“The pond had fallen into disuse over the years, and was filled with a carpet of water hyacinth. Parts of the pond on some side were encroached upon by people too, which has reduced its area considerably over the decades.

The only area which we have filled up is a water tank adjacent to the pond which was once used by dhobis and was no longer in use. This area was levelled off to be used for other purposes. The pond has been preserved as it is. We had expected to complete the work by this year, but due to the successive floods and COVID-19, there has been some delay. We are getting all the blame when we are trying to revive a pond which was no longer in use.

A pond is similarly being revived in Chanthavila now. We also have protected ponds in PTP Nagar, Muttada and other places,” says Palayam Rajan, Chairman of the Corporation's Town Planning Standing Committee.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/680v2a/article32838577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20201012131343,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/row-over-charachira-pond-work/article32838561.ece
185,2020/10/13,"Digital classrooms in 1,270 govt. schools in district","31,130 digital equipment installed

When Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday declared Kerala as the first State to have digital classrooms in all its public schools, the district had much to cheer for too.

High-tech classrooms became a reality in as many as 1,270 public schools in the district.

MLAs join in

Legislators from five constituencies in the district too joined in the inaugural session to make declarations for their specific regions. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran, who is the Minister in charge of the district, made the declaration in his constituency Kazhakkuttam.

Mr.Vijayan, in his inaugural speech, said that it is necessary for the progress of the society that the best educational facilities are affordable to all sections.

The Public Education Rejuvenation Mission has led to public schools with international standards in all constituencies, consequently reversing the trend of students dropping out of public schools and leading to a flow from the private to public sector.

As part of the initiative, 31,130 digital equipment were installed in 1,270 schools in the district.

Aided schools

In the Government-aided schools, the installation of digital equipment has been completed in 868 schools from Classes I to VII and in 402 schools from Classes VIII to XII.

A total of 9,507 laptops, 5,775 multimedia projectors, 7,970 USB speakers, 3,694 mounting accessories, 2,613 screens, 379 DSLR cameras, 399 multifunction printers, 401 High Definition web cameras and 392 43"" televisions were installed.

Broadband

High speed broadband facility is now available in 1,032 schools.

The most number of digital equipment were installed in the St.Mary's Higher Secondary School in Pattom, where 691 digital equipment were installed, sources aid.

Special IT training has been imparted to 15,194 teachers.

The High-tech school project was implemented by the Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) as part of the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission.

₹56.17 crore spent

As part of the project, a total of ₹56.17 crore was spent in the district, out of which the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) spent ₹48.61 crore and the local bodies pitched in with ₹7.56 crore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/digital-classrooms-in-1270-govt-schools-in-district/article32838535.ece
186,2020/10/13,Customary Navaratri procession to go on,"The State government on Monday said the Navaratri procession would take place with traditional piety and within the bounds of the COVID-19 protocol.

Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran had called a meeting of stakeholders to arrive at a consensus about the conduct of the festival.

Some Hindu groups had organised a belligerent street protest last week, accusing the government of attempting to thwart the age-old tradition of escorting Navaratri idols to the iconic Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple.

Members of the former ruling family of erstwhile Travancore, chief priest of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple and representatives of the Kerala Brahmana Sabha attended the meeting chaired by Mr. Surendran.

The conference decided to abandon the customary reception accorded to idols along the procession route.

The meeting also agreed to transport the three idols on palanquins carried by four bearers instead of the usual parade on elephant back and the silver equestrian idol.

The procession will start from Suchindram and reach Padmanabhapuram on October 13. The procession would reach Kuzhithura on October 14 and Kaliyakkavila on October 15. The police would accord a guard of honour.

The procession would rest at the historic Sree Krishna Swamy temple in Neyyattinkara and reach Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple locality at 4 p.m. on October 16.

Mayor K. Sreekumar, Shashi Tharoor, MP, V.S. Sivakumar and I.B. Satheesh, both MLAs, were among those who attended the conference.

BJP charge

BJP State president K. Surendran on Monday said Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran’s bid to thwart the customary Navaratri procession was misplaced and unacceptable.

He said Mr. Surendran’s move to transport Navaratri idols on trucks was an affront to tradition and custom.

Ideally, the government should allow the procession by observing the COVID-19 protocol.

The Minister had attempted to ban the customary offering of ghee in Sabarimala in the name of pandemic control, he said.

Mr. Surendran should realise that he was not the chief priest of the temple to arbitrate on religious observances.

Arbitrary

The Minister had arbitrarily decided Devaswom matters and displayed an unwillingness to consult other stakeholders, including representatives of devotees.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/customary-navaratri-procession-to-go-on/article32838520.ece

190,2020/10/13,IFFM reveals its film line-up for 2020 edition,"Special tributes are also planned for late Bollywood stars Irrfan Khan, Rishi Kapoor and Sushant Singh Rajput

191,2020/10/13,‘I can’t understand why I’m not cast in negative roles’: Aftab Shivdasani,"‘Grand Masti’ actor Aftab Shivdasani discusses his upcoming web series ‘Poison 2’ and his desire to play characters that have more than a few shades of grey

The arrival of a newborn into a family is not a task without challenges. Aftab Shivdasani, who welcomed a daughter in August is learning a thing or two about the job at hand.

“[Fatherhood] is an amazing feeling. It makes a big difference. My wife [Nin Dusanj] and I look at her, and then we look at each other and wonder if this is real. Her innocence brings us closer. Of course, everything now revolves around her... even these interviews,” the 42-year-old actor says, over phone from London, UK.

He describes himself as a “hands-on father”. “We share responsibilities... from changing nappies, to entertaining her, rocking her and putting her to bed. Except for feeding, of course,” he laughs.

The actor is set to make his digital streaming debut with the upcoming ZEE5 show Poison 2. Consisting of 11 episodes, Poison 2 streams from October 16; it is a revenge thriller web series directed by Vishal Pandya and produced by Panorama Entertainment and Bombay Media Works. Alongside Aftab, the show also stars Raai Laxmi, Zain Imam, Pooja Chopra, Rahul Dev and Vin Rana among others.

Aftab plays Aditya, a character with grey shades and who is out for revenge. The plot revolves around two camps’ attempt to take control of a racecourse by winning an auction. Of his character, Aftab says, “Aditya is a guy who people know little about. He is out to exact revenge on people who had wronged him in the past. There is that mystery about him; he is charming but also ruthless. As the show progresses, the audience learns more about what he has set out to do.”

Influential antagonist

It is easy to associate Aftab with the many romantic and comedy ventures, like the Masti franchise of films, that he has been part of in Bollywood. He is rueful of this fact because the actor believes that it has robbed him of opportunities to play more characters that have shades of grey; something he admittedly prefers experimenting with on screen.

“I’ve been trying to understand why people didn’t think of me in more such roles after Kasoor,” he says, referencing his second feature film as an adult since making the transition from a child actor. A Mukesh Bhatt production, Kasoor (2001) had Aftab play the role of a murderer, a performance for which he was lauded.

“It is almost as if people had forgotten about the film,” he continues. “They [filmmakers] kind of put me in a box... that of comedy. But I prefer playing the grey-ish characters because these are challenging to portray as an actor and there is something inherently entertaining about taking up such a role. I hope people notice me in Poison 2 and get me to do different stuff again,” he adds.

Poison 2 was scheduled for an April release, but a production delay caused by the COVID-19 lockdown pushed the show to October. It was one of the first productions to resume shooting once restrictions were relaxed. As he completed a schedule of filming post restart, Aftab contracted the virus.

“I was in the midst of catching a flight back to London to be with my wife and daughter. So, of course, the test returning positive threw me off guard. I missed them a lot,” he says, of the time he had to spend in isolation after contracting the virus. Aftab tested negative for COVID-19 early this month, and he left for London to be with his family soon after being cleared for travel.

In July this year, Aftab and his wife Nin launched their own production house, Mount Zen Media, with an aim to produce feature films, online shows and documentaries. The duo also announced its first project, a feature film starring Aftab titled Dhundh. However, the actor updates that the project is now in the backburner. “We are changing a couple of things with Dhundh, but we are also planning to do two more scripts. Once things are in place, we will make an announcement,” he adds.

The biggest challenge for the crew is to keep the movie 'Halal' (Halal - a term as per Quran which means ""lawful"" or ""allowed to do"" under Islamic believes).

196,2020/10/13,Netflix film ‘Light Up The Sky’ tracks BLACKPINK’s rise,"Fans will see a softer side to the K-pop girl power group in the documentary in which its members open up about their journey from teenage trainees to global superstars

BLACKPINK fans will see a softer side to the K-pop girl power group in a Netflix documentary in which its members open up about their journey from teenage trainees to global superstars.

BLACKPINK have become a global phenomenon since their debut in South Korea four years ago.

Some of their songs including “Kill This Love” have over one billion hits on YouTube and they have collaborated with stars such as Lady Gaga and Cardi B. In 2018 they worked with Dua Lipa on the single “Kiss and Make up”.

The foursome —Jisoo, Jennie, Rose and Lisa — are known for their catchy tunes mixing Korean and English and slick dance routines, but in “BLACKPINK: Light Up The Sky”, which premieres on Oct. 14, they wanted to dig deeper, said filmmaker Caroline Suh.

Suh combined home videos, behind the scenes footage and candid interviews to tell the life stories of the four women, aged 23 to 25, of whom only Jisoo grew up in Korea.

Lisa is Thai, Rose grew up in Australia and New Zealand and Jennie moved to New Zealand on her own as an 8-year-old, living with a home-stay family.

“I hope that the film humanises the BLACKPINK members so they are seen as more three dimensional and not as kind of one dimensional K-pop stars and idols,” said Suh. “I hope that people are empathetic toward them and cheer them on.”

As she gained the members’ trust, they started to share their experiences, including hardships they endured as trainees, Suh said.

Youngsters hoping to make it in the world of K-pop join training programmes consisting of hours of daily dance lessons, voice training and school work, alongside weekly auditions. They are not always successful.

YG Entertainment, which formed the group, did not set any conditions for the film crew, Suh said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vlsa02/article32841609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUSICBLACKPINK,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/netflix-film-light-up-the-sky-tracks-blackpinks-rise/article32841610.ece
197,2020/10/13,"‘The Haunting of Bly Manor’ review: Less scares, more heart","The follow-up to the successful ‘Hill House’ series is a more emotional affair, serving as a comment on the human condition and the tragedy of it

The Haunting of Bly Manor is quite obviously a sister story to The Haunting of the Hill House, but far more ambitious, less scary and with quite a bit more heart. The series, an adaptation of Henry James’ novella The Turn of the Screw, is a comment on the human condition and the tragedy of it. The new series on Netflix, unlike its predecessor, is sure to leave the viewer more sad than scared.

Bly Manor is the proverbial memory palace writ small, and like in Hill House, the ghosts here are rooted in cerebral horror. The discomfort which was created by the Hill House spectre is eerier and much more unsettling, but Bly Manor wins out when it comes to the human drama. There are surprising little nods at issues of gender and sexuality which one might scarce expect in a horror show, and they’re treated without being pretentious. There are monologues that melt into poetry, and a kiss hidden by flowers, almost like old-school Bollywood, only actually successful at implying something fragile and beautiful.

The season, over nine episodes, creates a world made convincing by the ensemble cast more than set design or even ambience. The real haunting plays out on the faces of the actors, many of them familiar from Hill House, but now entirely new. Victoria Pedretti, playing the protagonist, steals every frame she in in. There is something inherently melancholic in her face and at many points, she listens wordlessly to the stories of others, but their emotions play out on her eyes. The supporting cast who play the gardener, the housekeeper, the cook and the two children that Pedretti’s au pair is responsible for, carry the show as much as she does.

The Haunting of Bly Manor Director: Mike Flanagan

Cast: Victoria Pedretti, Amelie Bea Smith, Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, T’nia Miller, Amelia Eve, Rahul Kohli, Tahirah Sharif, Oliver Jackson-Cohen

No. of episodes: 9

Storyline: A governess, after going to Bly Manor to take care of two orphaned children, runs into multiple hauntings and her own past

The story fetches you in with alternating lulls of children speaking in creepily adult tongues, and then comfortable, friendly domesticity. It draws attention to the inner lives of the characters in a way that the ghosts are reduced truly to spectres fleeting in the background. They appear rather infrequently; the focus of the show remains on the origin stories. These, while enjoyable, don’t necessarily add to the point of the show in any novel way. There is however one entire episode dedicated to the malevolent ghost of the manor, set in a different century, that snags the narrative pace. It detracts from the atmospherics in that it fails to evoke feeling, unlike the rest of the characters and time-frames.

There is a narrative voice, too, that intervenes conveniently, leaving very little to the imagination. It’s poetic, but one wonders if the scenes might not have been sharper and more authentic without someone explaining away all of the motives and content. The narration feels more like reading than viewing, and remains one of the weaker aspects of the story. It is also what makes the events rather unmysterious.

The hero of The Haunting of Bly Manor, however, is theme. While Hill House showed that it is we who haunt us, Bly Manor believes our lovers and loved ones do so. The pervading ghost is the memory, which the characters sometimes inhabit and sometimes visit endlessly. It is also a look at the afterlife, with hell embodied in relentless reliving of painful memories: an eternal purgatory.

In the show, the lines blur between who is a ghost and who is a figment of the past

The characters speak to what haunts them and sometimes even live with it. There is no way that an outsider can know if Bly Manor is truly haunted by ghosts, or if the characters are blighted only by their past. The show is also existentialist as it sets up Bly Manor as a “glue-trap” for mice, with its own “gravity” that binds the characters to it. The show executes with perfection the idea of existence as a realm of endless return and inescapability. In a metaphorical scene, we are shown the dogged refusal of a ghost to look down the well — a rendition of the void — wherein lies the tawdry truth of existence: death.

Memories haunt and human beings “dream-hop” through time like ghosts. The lines blur between who is a ghost and who is a figment of the past. Both, through time, degenerate into literal facelessness and yet, the haunting continues.

Each ghost is different too, like the memories that birth them: some restful, some raging, and some others, resting a loving hand on the shoulder of the sleeping beloved. The phantasmagoric Bly Manor encapsulates the past as a home that one lives in, and only forgetfulness affords reprieve. Perhaps that is why it is revealed that no real place may be found by the name of Bly.

The love stories are the highest points of the series, tender in a way that leaves your heart warm and aching. The show creators in the voice of the narrator confess that a love story is the same as a ghost story; in the concluding montage, a character is shown leaving the door a crack open and a light dimly on in hopes of catching a glimpse of a lost lover, because “dead doesn’t mean gone”.

In the end, The Haunting of Bly Manor is only as haunting as our regular lives are, its phantoms only lovers from the past. Watch this one, if you will, for its human beings rather than its ghosts, and you might find plenty worth remembering.

A 31-year-old software professional crowd sourced funds through social media to set up a smart classroom in the Government Adi Dravidar Welfare Primary School in Vellore.

Vellore Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram inaugurated the facility on Tuesday.

Dinesh Saravanan from Rangapuram, Vellore, has been working in the IT industry since 2013. Every week he would visit this home town, do some social activity and then publish it on his social media account. Seeing his posts, many people sent him money to continue different social work and help others.

“I came to know that the Government Adi Dravidar Welfare Primary School at Nadaiparai, Vellore, did not have a smart class. I waited till I collected ₹1.15 lakh and then installed a projector, screen, soundproof ceiling, speakers, woofer and other facilities in a classroom. The room was painted with cartoon characters,” said Mr. Dinesh.

The school was started in 1947 and has 102 students and four teachers. “Children will be able to grasp things quickly if it is conveyed visually. Hence, the smart class will be of great help to us once school reopens,” said T. Anbazhagan, headmaster of the school.

Mr. Dinesh said he started social work in 2014 after his brother died. “He used to help others a lot,” he recalled.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/p1lfg3/article32844881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THVELLORESCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/it-professional-helps-set-up-smart-class-in-adi-dravidar-welfare-school/article32844882.ece

Congress is a party which has no thinking capacity and no mental development, former Congress spokesperson, Kushboo Sundar, who joined the BJP said on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters at the Chennai airport, Ms. Kushboo hit out at TNCC president K.S. Alagiri for his statement that the Congress had seen her only as an actress and that she did not have thinking capability.

“One leader [L. Murugan] is trying to build a party convincing people that BJP alone can do good for the country. Another leader [Alagiri] says I don’t have intelligence. So they came to know after six years of my hard work for the Congress that I don’t have intelligence?,” Ms. Kushboo asked.

She also said no one could criticise anything within the Congress party. “That’s a party where no one can even make criticisms internally. How can such a party be good for the country?,” she asked. When reporters asked if she would be able to make internal criticisms in the BJP, she said she believed that was possible. “I have confidence that BJP will not be like that [Congress]. I will answer when that sort a situation [where internal criticism is not allowed] arises,” she said.

Ms. Kushboo also said that her job as opposition spokesperson was to criticise the government and its schemes as politically and democratically having an opposition is good for the country. “But I supported NEP, abolition of triple talaq. You cannot criticise everything just for the sake of being the opposition,” she said.

She further added that she had carried out her job as opposition spokesperson to the best of her abilities when she was with the Congress. “I was loyal to that party till the last day I was there,” she said. She also added that the Congress was trying to find various faults with everything despite many of the schemes such as the GST, NEP, Farm Acts being started by the Congress itself.

On Mr. Alagiri’s criticism that she joined the BJP at the behest of her husband, director Sundar. C. reportedly facing financial problems, she asked whether people had ever seen him at any of the events with her/ “There is no such issue. “The fact that they are making all these allegations show how terrible they are,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/np2fzf/article32844462.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kush,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/congress-a-party-sans-mental-growth-kushboo/article32844463.ece

A case was filed against Mannampandal panchayat vice-president and her husband after president Priya Periyasamy, 23, belonging to a Scheduled Caste, staged a dharna for three hours in front of the Mayiladuthurai panchayat union office on Monday, alleging caste discrimination at workplace.

Amala and her husband Rajagopal were booked at the Mayiladuthurai station under the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and under the Indian Penal Code for causing annoyance with an obscene act at a public place and criminal intimidation.

Sources said the flashpoint came when Ms. Amala and Mr. Rajagopal sneered at Ms. Priya for having bought a revolving chair for her use in the office, in compliance with the procedures.

The Left parties and the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi members backed Ms. Priya, who withdrew the protest after Block Development Officer Saravanan assured her of action.

Discrimination alleged

Meanwhile, Erugaiyur panchayat president in the T. Palur block of Ariyalur district, also belonging to a Scheduled Caste, staged a dharna in front of the panchayat union office on Tuesday, alleging discrimination by the vice-president and ward members.

Dakshinamoorthy, 50, and his supporters alleged that he was ill-treated by vice-president Kanimozhi, her husband Sekar and a few ward members.

Mr. Dakshinamoorthy told journalists that he had undergone treatment at the Jayankondam Government General Hospital for the mental agony brought on by their ill-treatment.

He said the vice-president was bypassing authority, and he had already conveyed the matter to the Block Development Officer (BDO) through an advocate. BDO Sridevi met Mr. Dakshinamoorthy and assured him that his grievance would be redressed. Then, he withdrew the protest, sources said.

Official sources, however, said the interference in the administrative matters by Mr. Dakshinamoorthy’s son, a government employee, did not go down well with the ward members. Since the discord between the president and the ward members had been persisting for long, officials cautioned Mr. Dakshinamoorthy against allowing his son to interfere in the administration. Mr. Dakshinamoorthy had reasoned that he was uneducated, so he required his son’s assistance.

In a government order, S. Madhumathi, secretary, Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme Department said that the Commissioner of Social defence had sent a proposal for the creation of such a fund as instructed by the Chief Secretary, in the law and order meeting held in August this year. The Commissioner had requested the issuing of orders to establish a separate fund by making an initial allocation of ₹14.96 crore as a recurring expenditure.

From the fund which has been created, an interim compensation of ₹20,000 to the victim can be awarded. An annexure to the government order further details the quantum of compensation to victims under the POCSO Act -- from a minimum of ₹50,000 to a maximum of ₹10 lakh corresponding to the offence.

The order further said that the rules governing the composition and administration of the fund would be issued separately. A sum of ₹2 crore has been sanctioned by the government as an initial contribution to the fund.

An interim compensation is awarded by a special court, either on its own or based on an application filed on behalf of or by the child, to meet the needs of the child for relief or rehabilitation at any stage, after an FIR is registered. The creation of a separate fund to disburse compensation has been a long-standing demand of many activists, who have especially highlighted the need for timely interim compensation.

“While we are happy to see a sizeable allocation made for the fund, there is no clarity on whether this is in furtherance to the amount awarded by the court under the POCSO rules,” said Deepika Murali, an advocate practising at the Madras High Court. She further pointed out that the annexure, which has been given with the government order detailing the quantum of compensation to be given under each offence, has redundancies that need to be addressed.

“This should not create confusion which can lead to the funds stagnating and not reaching the victims on time,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-government-creates-fund-for-compensation-under-pocso-act/article32841039.ece

A senior official said the Strengthening Guidance (Tamil Nadu’s nodal agency for investment promotion and single window facilitation) team has helped the State bring in more investments. “The CM has been personally viewing each project or firm that evinces interest to invest in Tamil Nadu. These two formulas have worked out well,” he said. According to Neeraj Mittal, MD and CEO of Guidance, “The teams (Guidance, Industries Department and Sipcot) have been working 24/7 and we have broadened the scope of picking up leads. The CM is also reviewing all investment proposals that come in. And this has helped bring in more investment.”

Tamil Nadu’s excellent industrial ecosystem, trained manpower, connectivity, connected supply chains and pragmatic policies allows investors to take advantage of global realignment of value chains, he said.

212,2020/10/13,Ramadoss seeks quota for Vanniyars,"PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Monday wrote to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami seeking separate reservations for Vanniyar community and de-notified communities besides commissioning of a caste-wise population census.

He said that Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has agreed to conduct a census of denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes across India. Members of denotified communities live across Tamil Nadu and census should be conducted across all households to account for these communities.

“When the State does this exercise, a caste-wise census can be easily done. There won’t be any additional expenditure incurred as the Central government is funding it. The caste-wise census can be conducted through this,” said Dr. Ramadoss.

He pointed out that the Central government’s list of denotified communities, nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and the communities listed as per Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institution and of Appointments or Posts in the Services under the State) Act, 1993) 3 (A) are different.

“In majority of States, the denotified communities and nomadic communities were added to the SC list while in Tamil Nadu, they have been added to the most backward classes category. There are communities which are considered as denotified communities in some regions and Backward Classes in other regions. Some members of the backward communities obtain false certificates by providing wrong information as Most Backward Classes and enjoying the benefits of reservation,” he said. “Therefore, reservations of de-notified communities, Vanniyars and most backward classes are systematically denied.”

He said that denotified communities should be provided reservations as a separate category and 20% separate reservations should be provided to Vanniyar community.

“Other MBC communities can be given reservations based on their population,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ramadoss-seeks-quota-for-vanniyars/article32838948.ece

TVMCH dean M. Ravichandran said the patient had recorded two donor lungs in a transplant three to four years ago in Chennai and was on immunosuppressants. “Ten days ago, he came in with breathlessness and the CT scan showed changes in the lungs. There was blood in the sputum due to cough.

He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and also required oxygen support”, he said.

With treatment, his condition improved well, he said, adding: “He is now asymptomatic and is waiting to be discharged. He is now managing well on room air. We will discharge him after a final assessment.”

214,2020/10/13,HC directs Chief Secretary to appear through video conference,"Seeks assistance in disposing of pleas for disabled friendly buses

The Madras High Court on Monday directed the Chief Secretary and Transport Secretary to appear through video conference on December 10 and assist the court in disposing of writ petitions filed in 2005 and 2007 for operating disabled friendly buses and ensuring a barrier free environment for the physically challenged in public places.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha summoned the officials after senior counsel E. Omprakash, representing one of the petitioners and amicus curiae T. Mohan reported to the court that the transport corporations had not been purchasing disabled friendly buses despite a specific order passed by the court on April 6, 2016.

The then Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul (now a Supreme Court judge) and Justice M.M. Sundresh had disapproved of the practice of purchasing buses dedicated for the use of the physically challenged and operating them in select routes.

The judges had ordered that buses operated in all routes should be made disabled friendly.

“Steps to be taken for the benefit of the persons with special needs have to be inclusive in character. The idea cannot be to have separate buses but buses which are used daily by passengers meeting the requirement of persons with special needs… We thus direct that any new bus must meet the requirement of people with special needs,” the judges had ordered.

After this order was passed, the State government had procured more than 4,300 buses and around 800 buses had been purchased for the Metropolitan Transport Corporation which operates buses within Chennai city. However, not all of those buses were disabled friendly, Mr. Mohan complained to the court and sought appropriate orders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-directs-chief-secretary-to-appear-through-video-conference/article32838915.ece
215,2020/10/13,HC comes down heavily on lawyer for maligning reputation of judiciary,"Judges impose costs of ₹5 lakh, initiate criminal contempt and bar him from practice

The Madras High Court on Monday came down heavily on an advocate for filing a case to dislodge its Registrar (Vigilance) R. Poornima from the post on the basis of a false claim that she had not passed higher secondary examinations.

The court pulled him up also for getting details of his case published in sections of the media even before it could be listed for hearing.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed the litigant B. Sathishkumar of Chennai to pay ₹5 lakh in costs to Ms. Poornima in six weeks or end up facing revenue recovery proceedings by the jurisdictional Collector. They also initiated suo motu criminal contempt of court proceedings against him.

The first Division Bench barred the petitioner from practising before any judicial forum until the conclusion of the contempt proceedings. It directed him to appear before it on October 20 for framing of charges and proceeding further with the matter. The judges said they intend to take some serious steps regarding the role played by the media too.

The petitioner had claimed that Ms. Poornima had completed her Class X examinations in 1982 and then obtained graduation from University of Madras and a law degree from Mysore before getting appointed as a District Judge in December 2010. He claimed she had not pursued higher secondary course.

However, on verification of her service records, the judges found she had completed Class XII from Bethlehem Girls Higher Secondary School in Ooty in 1984.

When the Chief Justice asked the litigant’s counsel on what basis did his client make such a “patently false” statement on affidavit before the court and also got it published in some newspapers causing irreparable damage to the reputation of a judicial officer, the lawyer had no convincing reply. The CJ pointed out that the news was circulated widely on social media too.

He said it was evident that the petitioner had motivated reasons behind filing the case and he had deliberately presented false facts to make defamatory statements as if Ms. Poornima had usurped the office of a judicial officer. This was clearly an irresponsible act on the part of the petitioner and it amounted to perjury as well as criminal contempt, the CJ added.

He recalled that the petitioner also had a past history of filing frivolous petitions and it clearly tells upon his professional misconduct which deserved to be dealt with severely. Advocate C.K. Chandrasekhar, representing Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, said the council was also in possession of copies of educational certificates of Ms. Poornima.

When he said the media should be restrained from reporting about cases even before they could be listed for hearing, Chief Justice Sahi said the court would not gag the media since it enjoys the freedom of speech and expression. However, stating that the “press is also involved” in the present case, he said his Bench intends to take some serious steps in this regard.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-comes-down-heavily-on-lawyer-for-maligning-reputation-of-judiciary/article32838904.ece
216,2020/10/13,Northeast monsoon likely to set in after Oct. 25: IMD,"Conditions in Pacific Ocean will lead to a delayed onset, says weather agency

The northeast monsoon, which contributes the major share of annual rainfall in the region, is likely to set in over Tamil Nadu after October 25, according to the Meteorological Department.

Officials of the Meteorological Department said the southwest monsoon continued over the south Indian region due to La Niña conditions prevailing over the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, weather systems that are forming over the Bay of Bengal and moving north off south Indian coastal areas would also influence westerlies to prevail in the region, including Tamil Nadu, till October 22.

S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said La Niña was a global weather pattern that caused the ocean surface temperature in the equatorial Pacific Ocean to drop and influenced changes in global wind patterns, affecting weather conditions in regions, including India.

Exceptions

“It is often considered unfavourable for the northeast monsoon over Tamil Nadu. But, we have had exceptions as in 2005 when the State had a good monsoon. This year, we expect a late onset,” he said. Normally, the northeast monsoon sets in around October 20.

Earlier, the department had forecast that the prevailing global weather phenomenon would cause the northeast monsoon to bring below normal rain over southern Tamil Nadu and near normal rainfall over the northern parts.

The Meteorological Department also predicted light to moderate rain over some districts, including Vellore, Krishnagiri, Dindigul, Chennai, Kancheepuram, Coimbatore and Theni on Tuesday. The deep depression over Bay of Bengal which is likely to cross the north Andhra Pradesh coast close to Kakinada on Tuesday morning triggered rains over parts of Tamil Nadu, said officials.

On Monday evening, sharp showers lashed various parts of the city, including T. Nagar, Ennore, Meenambakkam, Vyasarpadi and Perambur. The weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded 2cm and 1cm of rainfall respectively till 7 p.m. The same weather trend is expected to continue in the city on Tuesday and light rains will occur in a few areas. The department warned fishermen not to venture into sea as strong winds, reaching speeds of up to 55 km per hour, were likely over the Comorin area and the Gulf of Munnar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7o2wky/article32838861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THRAINCITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/monsoon-likely-to-set-in-after-oct-25-imd/article32838862.ece

The judges also directed Thevoor police to take note of the video message that was circulated widely on the social media, conduct a qualitative investigation into the issue and file a final report before the jurisdictional court as early as possible.

218,2020/10/13,‘Congress tried to retain her’,"‘She was brainwashed to join a direct ideological opponent’

In the run up to Kushboo Sundar quitting the Congress, senior party leaders, including AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal and TNCC president K.S. Alagiri, had tried convincing her to stay put.

The two leaders separately held talks with her last week, when she had reportedly assured them that she wanted to work for the party, multiple top-level sources in the Congress told The Hindu.

The assurance had led the Congress to believe that the rumours of her moving to the BJP, which had grown stronger last week, were just speculation. By Sunday morning, however, a few State leaders knew that she was jumping ship.

After her resignation letter was made public on Monday, an angry Mr. Alagiri hit out at Ms. Sundar, claiming that the party cadre had only seen her as an actor and not a politician.

Mr. Alagiri charged that she only got publicity by speaking at events organised by the Congress and had not been very involved in the party’s activities during the recent months.

He said she was brainwashed to join a “direct ideological opponent” as her husband, director Sundar C., was reportedly facing financial difficulties. “She has pawned her ideology to the BJP,” he said.

This will be the third party that Ms. Sundar has joined in the last 10 years. Her first stint of four years was with the DMK, from 2010. In 2014, she quit the party, citing a lack of recognition, and saying that her work for the DMK continued to remain “a one-way road”. A few months later, she joined the Congress, terming it “a homecoming” and was made the Congress national spokesperson.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jvfgko/article32838837.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THALAGIRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/congress-tried-to-retain-her/article32838838.ece

220,2020/10/13,"GST dues: T.N. had no option but to borrow, says Minister","‘Govt. was conscious on reaching common meeting ground’

The Tamil Nadu government, which recently chose to borrow money under Option 1 of the two choices laid out by the Centre in lieu of the GST compensation dues, on Monday said it did so as it had no other option.

Speaking at the 42nd Goods and Services Tax Council meeting held through a video conference as a continuation of the meeting on October 5, Minister D. Jayakumar recalled the efforts the government had taken to insist the Centre to borrow money and give them to the States. He recalled the Chief Minister had written to the Prime Minister expressing this.

“Since Government of India appeared unwilling to borrow, we had no option but to choose from among the two options offered,” Mr. Jayakumar (specially deputed to look after GST issues by the State government) said.

A copy of his speech copy was released to the media.

The Tamil Nadu government was “conscious that reaching a common meeting ground is the need of the hour” in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and it was in that spirit that we had already in the previous meeting agreed to Option 1, he contended.

Early resolution

The Minister said he looked forward to an early resolution of the issue so that the States get the funds that they so urgently need for reviving the economy during the COVID-19 crisis.

“During a normal puja season, I am showered with orders from Kerala, the United States and other places, as jewellery for Bharatanatyam is a part of the salangai pooja conducted by the dancers. I would struggle to complete the orders in time. Now, however, I am left with no work,” lamented M. Muthusivam, a winner of the State government’s award. His father Manikkam is a national-award winner.

As many as 40 families in Vadasery are traditionally involved in making temple and Bharatanatyam jewellery. They have been given the Geographical-Indication (GI) mark by the Geographical Indications Registry.

Hit by lockdown

Known as Vadasery maalai, the products are in demand across the country and abroad. Non-resident Indians who visit Chennai for the arangetram of their daughters during the December season buy jewellery from them.

But the lockdown has forced many of them to eke out a livelihood by taking up menial jobs.

“In the first two months [of the lockdown] I was able to pay salaries to the workers from my pocket. Diminishing orders made it impossible for me to pay them and they have taken up jobs such as white washing and carpentry,” said S. Muthusamy, another craftsman.

He has, in the past, made jewellery for the ISKCON temple in Bengaluru and Devanathaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram.

Making temple jewellery is a unique craft. The jewellery is made of 75% silver and 25% gold. First, they make moulds in silver, and fill it with wax for fixing semi-precious stones and small leaves made of gold. Precious stones are used for the ornaments. One side of the jewellery is gold-plated to give them a finishing touch.

“A gram of gold costs ₹3,800. Since we get gold in the form of small leaves, the price goes up to ₹5,500. People who enquire about the jewellery do not place orders since the price has gone up,” said Mr. Muthusivam.

S. Ramachandran, who has made jewellery for dancers like Padma Subramaniam and Chitra Visweswaran, said he had not received even a single order in the current season.

“A set of ornaments for a Bharatanatyam dancer costs ₹1.20 lakh. Many of them opt for imitations as they can buy a set for ₹20,000. If the situation continues, it will be difficult for us to sustain work,” said Mr. Ramachandran, requesting the government to procure their products through Poompuhar.

Faced with uncertainty, Mr. Muthusivam has asked his two sons — both engineering graduates — not to enter the family profession. “How can I encourage them to take up my profession? I do not want them to suffer like me,” he said.

Mr. Muthsamy said he was planning to ask his cousin Thangavel to focus on a different job. “I do not want a loan or money; just a market for my products. Let the government arrange it through Poompuhar,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/adntxs/article32838818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jewellery,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pandemic-takes-the-shine-off-temple-and-bharatanatyam-jewellery-for-vadasery-craftsmen/article32838819.ece
222,2020/10/13,Teachers’ body backs Anna varsity Vice-Chancellor,"The Anna University Teachers’ Association has come out in support of Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa, demanding that the government allow the university to retain its name. The members, in a release, said he was working towards getting the institution the Institute-of-Eminence status.

The association said, “The AUTA reposes full faith in our honourable Vice-Chancellor and has confidence in his leadership. The eminent academic has made hectic efforts in the right direction to retain the name of Anna University for its prestigious main campuses — CEG, MIT, ACT and SAP — and to implement the Institute of Eminence status.”

It issued the release in the wake of the controversy generated by a report that the V-C had written to the Central government seeking funds. The AUTA said the letter was written four months ago. “The [news] report portraying the issue [on renaming the parent university] as a tug of war between the Centre and the State, and the State and the Vice-Chancellor, is far from truth,” the association said.

The issue is whether the “powerful players” are willing to allow Anna University, comprising its four prestigious campuses, to survive with the same name and grow, the members said. “IoE is just an added credit to Anna University, whereas the Tamil Nadu government’s reservation policy is bound to continue,” the members said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/teachers-body-backs-anna-varsity-vice-chancellor/article32838811.ece
223,2020/10/13,No need for debates on seat-sharing: DMK,"‘Some forces trying to cause confusion’

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday alleged that some forces and a few media organisations were trying to sow confusion in the minds of the DMK’s alliance partners by projecting various seat-sharing arrangements for the 2021 Assembly election.

“Some forces are trying to cause confusion in the DMK alliance with an ulterior motive. One or two media houses have joined them and are holding debates to put out such baseless arguments. This is not going to give them any electoral dividends,” Mr. Stalin said.

He said the debates were held on the presumption that DMK will contest 200 seats. “Only after the elections are notified, alliance parties will meet once, twice, or thrice to finalise the constituencies they will contest in. That is the general process. I cannot understand why these forces are being so hasty. These are not topics of debates at all,” Mr. Stalin said.

“These forces cannot shake up the existing DMK alliance. The path of the alliance is very clear,” he added.

In a separate statement, Mr. Stalin said he will chair the first meeting of the DMK’s manifesto committee on October 14 at Anna Arivalayam.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/whzlh2/article32838799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/no-need-for-debates-on-seat-sharing-dmk/article32838800.ece
224,2020/10/13,Shai Evra bags Ramanujan award,"‘His work will have implications even outside mathematics’

The 2020 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize will be awarded to Shai Evra of Princeton University, U.S., and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.

According to a press release, the annual prize is given for outstanding contributions by individuals not exceeding the age of 32, in areas of mathematics, influenced by Ramanujan in a broad sense.

Mr. Evra’s research concerns locally symmetric spaces of arithmetic groups and their combinatoric, geometric and topological structure.

The prize is awarded annually at an international conference in Number Theory, during December 21-22, at SASTRA University in Kumbakonam. Since the conference will not take place this year, Mr. Evra will receive the prize in 2021, in Kumbakonam.

According to the citation, the award is for his outstanding work on high dimensional expanders in the area of combinatorial and geometric topology and on “Golden Gates” for three dimensional unitary groups.

He employed “deep results from representation theory and number theory, pertaining to the Generalised Ramanujan Conjectures. The prize recognises his fundamental paper in the Journal of Topology and Analysis, in which he extends both the combinatorics and automorphic form theory to generalise the construction of Gromox and others on expander graphs”.

His fundamental work will have major implications even outside mathematics, extending into theoretical computer science, according to the citation.

The 2020 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize Committee comprised Krishnaswami Alladi- chair (University of Florida); William Duke (University of California, Los Angeles); Kevin Ford (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign); Anne Schilling (University of California, Davis); Robert Tijdeman (Leiden University); Maryna Viazovska (Ecole Polytechnique, Lausanne) and Shouwu Zhang (Princeton University).",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/shai-evra-bags-ramanujan-award/article32838766.ece
225,2020/10/13,Modi will take nation forward: Kushboo,"Actor-politician accuses leaders in the Congress of suppressing people like her

Actor-politician Kushboo Sundar, who has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP and its policies, joined the ruling party on Monday afternoon after tendering her resignation to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, accusing some leaders in the Congress of pushing and suppressing people like her.

Speculation was rife in the past few months that the BJP was wooing her. Even last week, Ms. Sundar had launched a scathing attack on the BJP and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at a rally to condemn the Hathras gangrape and the events that unfolded following the death of the girl.

Terming her joining the BJP as “taking a step forward”, she said on Monday: “I have come to understand that if a nation has to move forward, we need someone like our honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji to take the nation in its right direction and to its glory. I am completely at service to the BJP and I will do my best to make sure that my State Tamil Nadu [BJP] sees victory in the upcoming elections”.

“I have done today what I should have done long back. I had to be loyal to the place I was in, before I submitted my resignation,” she told reporters. She refused to name who in the Congress had suppressed her.

‘Duty to criticise’

“Change is constant in people’s lives. Yes, I have spoken against the PM and the BJP very harshly. But now I am able to see what is good for the country. When a party [Congress] is not able to control its own organisation, how will it run the country?” she asked.

She pointed out that as the spokesperson of the Opposition, she had to criticise the ruling party. She said she had also praised some of its initiatives.

She said there were no corruption charges against anyone in the BJP and that the Congress did not have a majority in the Parliament because people did not have confidence in the party.

Ms. Sundar further added that her ideology would remain the same, although she had changed her party. “I am more of an activist than a politician,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9w363e/article32833299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kushboo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/modi-will-take-nation-forward-kushboo/article32838764.ece

Daylong heavy to very heavy rains pounded erstwhile Nalgonda district on Tuesday, and the three districts remained engulfed in grey and dark clouds.

Several colonies, markets and bridges in low-lying areas, including several towns, were inundated in the heavy flood forcing normal life to a grinding halt. Most gates of the three projects — Nagarjunasagar, Musi and Pulichintala — were kept open to let out water as they continued to receive heavy inflows.

With constant increase in the inflows, the discharge of flood at Srisailam dam crossed 4 lakh cusecs on Tuesday evening and it is expected continue through Wednesday forenoon with heavy inflows likely to continue further with the impact of rains in the catchment areas of Krishna and many of its tributaries.

According to an advisory of the Central Water Commission (CWC) for the entire Krishna Basin and the Bhima sub-basin, heavy inflows are expected to continue further due to heavy rainfall warning for central Maharashtra and heavy to very heavy rainfall for north interior Karnataka, Marathwada, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

Due to the forecast rainfall, inflows into all dams in Krishna Basin are likely to increase rapidly, including Narayanpur and Tungabhadra dams. In the lower Krishna basin, very heavy rainfall in the catchment area of the rivers Paleru, Munneru and Wyra was leading rise the flood levels. Besides, flood level to Musi and its tributaries is also likely to rise rapidly.

As the inflows into crossed 3.8 lakh cusecs from 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the dam authorities have increased the discharge of flood to nearly 3.8 lakh cusecs from the spillway by lifting 10 crest gates for 15 feet height each. Another 26,000 cusecs water was also being let into the river after power generation in the right bank hydel station of A.P.

Very high rainfall, up to 19.6 cm, was recorded in the during the 24-hour period up to 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday and the intensity continued throughout the day on Tuesday across Telangana due to the impact of deep depression over Bay of Bengal, that made landfall near Kakinada in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday morninng, combined with the southwest monsoon which has been vigorous over the State and north interior Karnataka.

According to the Disaster Management Department of the State government, very heavy rainfall was recorded at a few places in Khammam and Bhadradri-Kothagudem districts and heavy rainfall occurred at some places in Khammam, Bhadradri, Mahabubabad, Suryapet, Nagarkurnool and Wanaparthy districts. A highest rainfall of over 19.6 cm rain was recorded at Vemsoor in Khammam district during the 24-hour period till 8.30 am on Tuesday.

The heavy rainfall flooded vast swathes of fields under cotton and other crops and disrupted normal life in both Khammam and Bhadradri-Kothagudem districts. The incessant rains have triggered flash floods in Wyra, Munneru, Pedda Cheruvu, Rathoni Cheruvu, and various other rivulets and streams across Khammam district, cutting off road link to several villages and swamping low-lying areas in Madhira, Penuballi and several other mandals on Tuesday.

The rain fury was at its worst in Thallada mandal as a wall of the government high school building in Kurnavalli village collapsed due to overnight heavy rainfall in the small hours of Tuesday. About 20 quintals of PDS rice and several “Bathukamma sarees” stocked inside a room in the same building got soaked as rainwater gushed into the premises, sources added.

In Penuballi mandal, a middle aged farmer was feared drowned after he was washed away by swirling waters of Rathoni Cheruvu near the mandal headquarters town on Tuesday morning. The farmer’s son narrowly escaped from getting swept away by strong undercurrent in the stream. Efforts by the police and local youth to trace the farmer proved futile till late in the evening.

In Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, road connectivity to several border villages in Aswaraopeta mandal, adjoining Andhra Pradesh, was disrupted for several hours on Tuesday morning due to overflowing of streams across the low-level road points at various stretches of Aswaraopeta-Vagoddugudem and other main roads.

The Met Department has forecast that enhanced rainfall activity is expected over the State up to Wednesday morning due to the impact of deep depression over the west-central Bay of Bengal which has crossed over the land and would gradually recede. According to the forecast, very heavy to extreme rain is expected at a few places in Rangareddy, Mahabubnagar, Vikarabad, Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri and Nalgonda districts till Wednesday morning.

232,2020/10/13,Time slot booking made mandatory for registering property in Telangana,"Discretionary powers of registering officers to be removed to streamline stamp duty collection

The State government has decided to reduce discrepancies in the collection of stamp duty charges by removing discretionary powers of the officials concerned.

The Legislative Assembly passed the Bill — the Indian Stamp (Telangana Amendment) Act, 2020 — during its special session on Tuesday. The Bill envisages making time-slot booking for registration of documents by the sub-registrar mandatory. “Time slots will be allotted after payment of full amount of stamp duty,” the Bill said.

Introducing the Bill on behalf of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, Legislative Affairs Minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy said the recently passed Telangana Rights in Land and Pattadar Passbooks Act made it mandatory for the citizens to apply for registration through Dharani portal and select a time-slot after paying full stamp duty. It was accordingly decided to make time slot booking mandatory for the non-agricultural properties too.

Section 47-A of Indian Stamp Act in its present form gave discretion to the registering officer and option to the citizen to pay lesser duty disputing the market value fixed by the committee. Documents were being referred to the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps for determination of market value and the process gve discretionary powers to the registering officers.

This provision of the law was not completely consonant with the new system of time-slot booking through Dharani portal and there was also need to remove the discretionary powers of the registering officers. It was therefore decided to amend Section 47-A of the Indian Stamp Act suitably so as to bring it in conformity with the legal framework under the recently passed Act.

“The Bill is aimed at preventing under-valuation of properties and in turn causing a loss to the government,” Mr. Prashanth Reddy said. Replying to queries, he said citizens could make an appeal to the committee headed by the district collector comprising the district registering officer and others as members in case of grievances. “The committee rather than individuals will look into the grievances,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/time-slot-booking-made-mandatory-for-registering-property-in-telangana/article32845052.ece
233,2020/10/13,Harish challenges BJP on pensions,"Ready for open debate on the shares of Centre and State in social welfare pensions, says Telangana Minister for Finance

Minister for Finance T. Harish Rao dared BJP to an open debate on pensions being distributed to the beneficiaries. He said that the amount being released by the Centre is peanuts compared to what is being paid by the State government.

“We are spending about ₹ 11,720 crore on pension every year while the Centre releases only ₹ 210 crore. The BJP leaders are saying that pensions are being distributed by the Centre. We are ready for an open debate on the subject,” he said at a function where BJP district secretary Bal Lakshmi and her associates joined the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi here on Tuesday. BJP Indupriyal village president Suresh also joined the party. He alleged that the BJP leaders have been trying to take the total credit for pensions and demanded that the actual figures of the Central and State government share be made public. He said that the new laws on deregulation of agricultural markets, introduced by the Centre, would harm the interests of farmers.

“Think about the leaders coming in large cars from Hyderabad to Dubbak for election campaign and they will be here only till elections are over. After the elections none of them will be seen here. Vote for TRS candidate Ms. Sujatha. I will be here and it is my responsibility to develop Dubbak assembly constituency,” Mr. Harish Rao said.

He claimed that both Congress and TDP did nothing while it was only Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao who came to the rescue of people who suffered during lockdown.

This was announced at a media conference by CPI, CPI(M), Socialist Unity Centre of India (C), Revolutionary Socialist Party and Forward Bloc. Their leaders held elaborate discussions on the choice of candidates before coming to the conclusion.

CPI (M) State secretary T. Veerabhadram and his CPI counterpart Chada Venkat Reddy said the parties tried to evolve consensus among the opposition parties, including the TDP and the TJS, for fielding a common candidate, but in vain.

The detailed discussions held on Sunday in this regard failed to yield any result and hence, a decision was taken to field the candidate of their choice in the ensuing elections. It was accordingly decided to field Mr. Jayasaradhi Reddy, who is with the CPI since his student days. The parties decided to extend their support to Prof. Nageshwar as he could effectively raise the issues of immediate public importance in the Elders’ House in his earlier stint as MLC.

Tokyo will host an international gymnastics tournament on Nov. 8, the Japan Gymnastics Association (JGA) has said, an event which could serve as a trial run for next year's rearranged Olympic Games.

238,2020/10/13,"‘Shocked’ by Maharashtra Governor’s language, Sharad Pawar tells Narendra Modi","NCP chief’s letter to PM backs Thackeray’s reply.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar on Tuesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi backing Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in his verbal spat with Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on the decision not to reopen temples in the State.

Mr. Pawar said he was pained at the erosion of standards of conduct by the high constitutional office of the Governor. “I was shocked and surprised to see the letter of the Governor released to the media and the kind of language used,” he wrote.

“In the very Preamble of our Constitution the word ‘Secular’ is added that equates and shields all religions and hence the Chair of the Chief Minister must uphold such tenets of the Constitution. Unfortunately Hon. Governor’s letter to Chief Minister invokes the connotation as if written to the leader of a political party,” said Mr. Pawar.

Mr Koshyari had asked Mr. Thackeray “have you suddenly turned ‘secular’ ”, questioning the continued closure of temples.

Mr Koshiyari said, “I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of the places of worships times and again or have you suddenly turned ‘secular’ yourselves, the term you hated?”

“Do you consider opening temples as Hindutva and not opening them as secularism? Then what about the Constitution on which you were sworn in as Governor? Secularism is a core of Constitution. Don't you follow Constitution?” Mr Thackeray had replied.

The NCP chief in his letter to the PM said he ‘too would have noticed the intemperate language that has been used’ by Mr Koshyari.

“The tone and tenor used must always be in keeping with the stature of the constitutional post occupied by individuals. Looking at the turn of events, the Chief Minister, in fact, was left with no option but to release his reply in the press,” said Mr Pawar, adding that he does not oppose free exchange of views between both the individuals in a democracy.

The Maharashtra Congress also said the Governor’s statement was against the Constitution. “Governor has touched the foundation of Constitution and basic principles on which it is based. I will not personally attack him, but he should be careful while using the language,” said State Congress president and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/976xkh/article32846702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THRDSHARAD1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shocked-by-maharashtra-governors-language-pawar-tells-modi/article32846703.ece
239,2020/10/13,Punjab farmer groups to hold talks with Centre on agriculture laws,"But we will also continue our protests, they say and list some demands

At least 28 farmer unions in Punjab, which have been protesting the controversial new farm marketing laws, have agreed to hold discussions on the issue with the Central Agriculture Ministry in Delhi on Wednesday, after rejecting a previous invitation just days ago. However, they emphasised that protests will also continue.

Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal’s invitation to the unions to hold talks in Delhi was the trigger for much debate and argument among farmer leaders at a coordination meeting in Chandigarh on Tuesday evening. Some groups wanted to attend to showcase their willingness to talk to the government while others demanded that the Centre depute representatives authorised to negotiate the repeal of the laws and discuss a new law guaranteeing MSPs.

At the end of the day, most unions agreed to participate with the caveat that they will not lift their agitation — blocking roads and rail lines. The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and the Punjab unit of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait) were among the few hold-outs who said they will not attend the meeting.

“The government of India has always been serious about agriculture. Therefore, the Central government is eager to talk to you,” said Mr. Agarwal’s invitation, which noted that the Punjab farmers have been agitating for days.

“We have accepted the invitation extended by the Agriculture Secretary for the meeting. We don’t want to give the government an excuse that we are not willing to talk on the issue, and hence we have decided to participate,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).

Mr. Singh said farmer outfits have also decided to continue their ‘rail-roko’ agitation across the State. “It was also decided that if the Punjab government did not convene an Assembly session by October 15 to repeal the laws, we will start boycotting Congress leaders, the same way as the BJP leaders are being boycotted,” he said.

The Jai Kisan Andolan went into Tuesday’s meeting opposed to accepting the Agriculture Secretary’s invitation. “The Secretary had first invited the farmer groups for a meeting on October 8 to educate us about the benefits of the new laws, and that was unanimously rejected by all the unions. This second invite has omitted that language and simply invites us for discussions,” said national convenor Avik Saha.

“But we have three demands: we will come only if you are willing to discuss scrapping the laws and enacting a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Prices (MSP), and we want to talk to someone who is actually authorised to negotiate by the Cabinet.” However, by the end of the day, JKA’s Punjab unit had agreed to meet Mr. Agarwal along with the other unions, though it reiterated its demands.

The Agriculture Secretary’s letter was sent to 29 groups, of which eight call themselves a faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, the group originally founded by iconic farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh. The faction named after the western Uttar Pradesh leader Mahendra Singh Tikait claims it is the only registered BKU and insists it will not take part in the talk.

“This is only an eyewash by the Central government. After the laws have been passed and signed by the President, what is the point of calling farmers for discussion when you did not listen to us before? In our opinion, it is meaningless and we will not take part,” said Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of the BKU (Tikait). “We will continue to protest not only in Punjab and Haryana but also across the country and demand a law to ensure MSP and improvements to the existing mandi system.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uuzrh6/article32846696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PUNJABFARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-farmer-groups-to-hold-talks-with-centre-on-agriculture-laws/article32846697.ece
240,2020/10/13,"MLAs in Haryana can now use ‘flag’ on official, personal vehicles","The basic idea behind the decision is to give due recognition to them, says Speaker

Legislators in the BJP-ruled Haryana can now use ‘flag’ on their official, private or even hired vehicles — a decision taken so that they can get “due recognition”.

Speaker Gian Chand Gupta on Tuesday said the sitting MLAs authorised by the Vidhan Sabha shall use the flag on his or her vehicle, which is registered in his or her name.

“In case, the sitting MLA does not have any vehicle registered in his or her name, then the flag can be used on the private or hired vehicles,” he said.

Mr. Gupta told The Hindu that the decision was taken so that the MLAs can get “due recognition” in public. “The basic idea behind the decision is to give due recognition to MLAs. They had to face humiliation at toll plazas. On many occasions, there had been instances when they were asked to prove their identity. So, now alongwith the flag, we have decided to give authorisation letters to MLAs. It’s a recognition of an elected representative,” he said.

“As per protocol, MLA is equal or above the rank of Chief Secretary. When bureaucrats are using flags, then there’s no reason why MLAs can’t use it. It’s not promoting VIP culture,” he said, adding that the MLA is an elected representative and the flag, which we are giving, just mentions Haryana Vidhan Sabha MLA and nothing else.

Mr. Gupta said in case the vehicle is not carrying a sitting MLA, then the flag shall remain covered by a white cover. “The MLAs have to apply for the flag to the Haryana Vidhan Sabha and the authorisation for the use of flag by sitting MLA will be issued by the transport commissioner in a prescribed form.”

The authorisation will remain valid till the completion of the tenure of the Vidhan Sabha or till the MLAs have the membership of the Assembly.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/w9pypk/article32846121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARYANASPEAKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mlas-in-haryana-can-now-use-flag-on-official-personal-vehicles/article32846122.ece
241,2020/10/13,Amit Shah on Gujarat visit ahead of by-polls,"Private visit to home State is Minister’s first since March 2020

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday arrived in Ahmedabad ahead of the crucial eight-seat Assembly by-polls in the State. This is his first visit to his home State since March 2020. His last visit to Ahmedabad was during U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit in the last week of February.

Gujarat Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president C.R. Paatil and other party workers were at the airport to receive him.

Sources said Mr. Shah is expected to be in the State till October 17 on a private visit, and hence there was no official word on it.

Accompanied by his family, Mr. Shah is expected to pay a ritual visit his family deity’s temple in their native town of Mansa in north Gujarat on the first day of Navratri.

The Home Minister is also likely to hold meetings with party leaders, workers and key figures, including Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, and new party president Mr. Paatil.

By-elections for eight Assembly seats are scheduled for next month. An organisational revamp of the State BJP unit after Mr. Paatil took over is also on the cards.

The eight Assembly seats going for by-polls are — Abdasa, Limbdi, Gadhada, Dangs, Dhari, Morbi, Kaprada and Karjan. The by-polls were necessitated after resignations by Congress MLAs who switched sides. Five Congress MLAs had resigned in March and three in June this year in the run-up to the Rajya Sabha polls.

The ruling party has so far declared seven candidates for the polls, of which five were previously with the Congress.

242,2020/10/13,Kolkata’s iconic double-decker buses return to city streets to boost tourism,"They will tour the heritage and landmark places highlighting the culture and tradition, says Mamata

To boost tourism in the city during the Durga Puja, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday launched two double-decker buses.

“Such buses are usually seen in London. They will tour the heritage and landmark places in the city and highlight the culture and tradition,” Ms. Banerjee said flagging off the buses. The buses, considered part of Kolkata’s colonial transport legacy, were introduced in the city during the 1920s and were phased out in the first decade of the 21st century. Attempts made to reintroduce them as a mode of transport in the city, which has one of the lowest road areas compared to other metropolises, could not fructify.

A statement by the State government on the launch said “special sightseeing services of the double decker” have the objective of “boosting heritage and cultural trails of Kolkata”. A ride can be booked online from October 23. The landmarks the buses will cover include Victoria Memorial, Fort William, St. John’s Church, Old Currency Building, Dalhousie Square, GOP, Great Eastern Hotel, Eden Gardens and Princep Ghat among others.

The Chief Minister said more routes can be added after considering the response. A few days ago, the Transport department started a cruise on river Hooghly touching upon the heritage ghats of the city.

Ms. Banerjee said her government will ask the Ministry of Civil Aviation to restore direct flights from Kolkata to European cities including London.

“We will request the Ministry of Civil Aviation because Kolkata is the gateway of the northeastern region. A lot of people want to travel to Europe from Kolkata. We want the flights to be restored and the direct flights from Kolkata should be a permanent basis,” she said. The Chief Minister said the flights operating out of the city to Europe are connecting flights via Mumbai or Delhi. She said letters were sent to the Ministry by the earlier Chief Secretary and has asked the present Chief Secretary to write again to the Ministry.

She said her government is ready to facilitate COVID-19 tests at the Kolkata airport and help the passengers returning from abroad if that is an issue with resuming direct flights to the city. “We have been pursuing this for 10 to 12 years and are ready to extend different facilities for the same.” Incoming flights to Kolkata not only from foreign destinations but six cities in the country were suspended till August 31 as per the requests by the State government to contain the spread of the pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/y99y5h/article32845753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DOUBLEDECKERBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kolkatas-iconic-double-decker-buses-return-to-city-streets-to-boost-tourism/article32845754.ece
243,2020/10/13,Jabalpur doctor calls out fake news over Hathras visit,"To take legal action against media for reports over her visit to victim’s family

A doctor at the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Medical College, Jabalpur, has said she was moving the courts against an attempt by some sections of the media to defame her and hurt her dignity after she visited the family of the Hathras victim.

A Demonstrator in the Pharmacology Department, Rajkumari Bansal earlier this month visited the family of a 19-year-old Dalit girl, who died at a Delhi hospital while undergoing treatment after being allegedly raped last month.

Unsubstantiated claims

Later, sections of the media levelled unsubstantiated allegations against the doctor — that she had Maoist links; that she falsely claimed to be the victim’s sister-in-law; and that she was part of an international conspiracy to defame and destabilise the Yogi Adityanath government. Dr. Bansal has denied all these charges.

Claiming a “big conspiracy” was being scripted against her, that she reportedly went to Hathras provoke the family and incite riots, Dr. Bansal told The Hindu, “I am being framed. Those making such baseless allegations have to supply the proof backing them.”

Denying she ever pretended to be the victim’s sister-in-law, Dr. Bansal, who said she worked for the poor and for women’s empowerment in addition to her official duties, “In no video clip can you see the family claiming me to be a member or the other way round. I don’t know how this narrative was built, whose plan it was.”

Personal initiative

Stating that she had taken leave from the department to visit Hathras, she added, “I didn’t go there just because it was a rape case. She [the victim] was abruptly cremated and no one was allowed to meet her family. There is no one to fix responsibility. Being a common person, I thought of visiting a fellow citizen’s place on a humanitarian ground.”

Meanwhile, college Dean P.K. Kasar said they had not served a notice on Dr. Bansal as claimed by the media. “We haven’t received any communication from the government or elsewhere directing it. As for a departmental inquiry, how can we initiate it without a formal complaint?”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jabalpur-doctor-calls-out-fake-news-over-hathras-visit/article32845442.ece

246,2020/10/13,New project in Odisha to provide tap water fit for consumption in urban areas,"The initiative aims to benefit more than 15 lakh people in the cities, says Minister Pratap Jena

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday virtually launched the ‘Sujal- Drink from Tap Mission’ here, making Odisha “the first State in the country to provide quality drinking water, fit for direct consumption, in urban areas”, a Minister said.

The initiative aims to benefit more than 15 lakh people in the cities, state Housing and Urban Development Minister Pratap Jena said.

The project, in its first phase, will supply drinking water to Bhubaneswar and Puri.

“Odisha is the first state in India, where people in urban areas will be able to drink water directly from taps, under the government’s new initiative,” Mr. Jena stated.

Mr. Patnaik, on the occasion, said the initiative, for which the state is spending ₹1,300 crore, will be extended in a phased-manner to other districts.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra Tuesday slammed the Yogi Adityanath dispensation over alleged pouring of a chemical on three sisters in Gonda, saying the Uttar Pradesh government’s politically motivated narrative of “protecting” and justifying perpetrators of crimes against women has emboldened them.

Three sisters suffered burn injuries when someone allegedly poured a chemical on them while they were sleeping on the roof of their house in Paksa village of Gonda, police said on Tuesday.

The three are undergoing treatment at the district hospital and they are out of danger, according to doctors.

Tagging a video in which the father of the girls is narrating the incident to media persons, Priyanka Gandhi tweeted, “This man’s three daughters aged 17, 10 & 8 were asleep in their home when someone entered and threw acid on them.”

“The U.P. government’s politically motivated narrative of justifying and protecting perpetrators of crimes against women has only emboldened criminals across the state,” she said.

Superintendent of Police Shailesh Kumar Pandey said the incident took place on Monday night when the girls were sleeping on the roof of their house.

An unidentified person poured a chemical on the eldest girl and some of it fell on her younger sisters as well who were also sleeping with her.

Asked if it was an acid attack, the SP said, “The chemical used in the attack is yet to be ascertained. It will be clear after a probe by experts.”

The Congress has also been attacking the Uttar Pradesh government over the Hathras incident in which a 19-year-old Dalit woman from the district was allegedly raped and attacked by four men. She later succumbed to injuries at a Delhi hospital.

The Yogi Adityanath government is fighting severe criticism for its handling of the Hathras case, particularly after the local police cremated the woman’s body at night allegedly without the family’s approval.

However, officials said the cremation was done “as per the wishes of the family“.

The Assam government has issued a set of guidelines for a subdued Durga Puja celebration with a view to minimising infection by the novel coronavirus.

According to the guidelines, puja pavilions will have to be open with entry and exit gates and all members of the puja committees as well as priests and visitors will have to undergo COVID-19 tests before and after the puja.

Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday said a maximum of 50 people would be allowed at a pavilion at a time and wearing a mask is mandatory for everyone from committee members to devotees. No pavilion would be allowed to be open beyond 10 p.m.

“The pandemic has started flattening in Assam. The positivity rate, which was once near the 9% mark, is now just above 3%. We will achieve more success if we remain alert for the next few days,” Dr. Sarma told journalists.

Positivity rate

The positivity rate had been dipping consistently since October 6. More than 10% of the State’s population of 3.3 crore have been tested and 1,521 of some 1.08 lakh people tested on Monday were found to be positive.

“Altogether 826 people died of the disease so far in Assam. Around 1,000 others died due to various other diseases. Even if we attribute all these deaths to the pandemic, our mortality rate will be less than 1%. The recovery rate is 85%,” he noted.

Dr Sarma, however, advised people not to let their guard down.

“There are worries about a possible wave during winter. So, we have to be careful. Flattening or no flattening, we have to continue conducting the tests,” he said.

249,2020/10/13,‘Acid’ attack on three minor girls in Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda district,"Police are yet to identify the chemical and have launched a forensic examination.

Three minor girls were attacked with some chemical on their faces while they were sleeping in their house in a village in Gonda district, police said on Tuesday.

While the family said the girls had acid thrown on their faces, police are yet to identify the chemical and have launched a forensic examination.

The incident took place in Parsapur area of the district.

Father of the girls Gurhai said it took place at 1:30 am on Tuesday. He was sleeping on the verandah on the ground floor while the three girls were sleeping on the first floor, he said.

He said he had no clue about who attacked the girls and suspects that the suspects used a ladder to climb up to the room from the other side.

“When my daughters screamed, I immediately opened the door and grabbed one of them. When my vest burned, I got to know that somebody had thrown acid at them”, he told a local news channel.

Shailesh Kumar Pandey, SP Gonda, said the eldest daughter suffered 30% burns, while the other two suffered 20% and 5-7% burn injuries.

Out of danger

All the three girls were out of danger and receiving treatment at a hospital, said police.

The Arunachal Pradesh State Commission for Women (APSCW) has slammed the reported assault on a woman in the State’s Changlang district for allegedly eloping with a married man to escape an abusive marriage.

APSCW chairperson Radhilu Chai Techi said on October 12 that the district authorities and the police had been asked to conduct a free and fair investigation and book the culprits involved in the incident.

The commission had acted on the basis of a written complaint from the local Women Welfare Association of Narcotic Cell.

“The district police said 15 people have been arrested so far and efforts were on to arrest the others as soon as possible,” Ms. Techi said.

She added that the victim would be filing a separate case of domestic violence under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, against her husband and his family in consultation with the APSCW.

According to reports, villagers had pulled the victim out of a vehicle on September 25, ripped her clothes apart, shoved and abused her. She ran away to escape the humiliation but a video on her assault was later uploaded on social media platforms.

The victim was quoted as saying that she had eloped with a married man in the hope of a better life after staying in an abusive marriage for five years.

After the foundation stone plaque laid by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi at the ‘Atal Tunnel’ in Himachal Pradesh’s Rohtang allegedly went ‘missing’, the Congress has threatened State-wide agitation.

Terming it as an ‘insult to democracy’, Mr. Rathore said the Congress had also decided to register an FIR in the matter. “The State government and police are responsible for the foundation stone plaque going missing,” he said.

On Monday morning, residents blocked the tracks in Chinsurah in Hooghly district resulting in some violence at Liluah station. Railway Protection Force personnel tried to detain some passengers who had boarded a special train meant for those on emergency duty services.

270,2020/10/13,9th Century grinding stones discovered at Bhavani taluk,"The archaeology team also found a 13th Century hero stone

Three grinding stones and a hero stone belonging to the ninth and 13th Century respectively were identified by a team of archaeology enthusiasts at Sanarpalayam village in Bhavani Taluk recently.

Based on information from Jambai Palaniappan, a team comprising Ponnusamy, Sudhakar Nalliappan and Kumaravel Ramasamy, found the grinding stones, each measuring 90 cm in diameter and 40 cm in depth. They were placed for common usage of the people. In one stone, a three-line inscription was found and the readable form of the word carries the name Valavaraya.

Inscriptions identified in Kongu region until the period of 10th Century do not carry the names of any rules or kings. “Only regional leaders were involved in such social work and he could be the person who created the stone”, said the members.

The hero stone, measuring 135 cm height and 115 cm breath, has a fully carved with embossed feature of a hero in which the inscriptions were deciphered. “The hero holds a long sword in his right hand and a flat shield in his left hand readily facing the enemy while his clothes look like fluttering in wind”, they added.

Inscription speaks about a hero who lost his life to protect his people from quarrel. The word Oorali meaning, 'person who rules', is seen in another hero stone inscription from the same area and is used to denote the head of a society. “The hero stones do not carry the name of the hero and are created to praise his sacrifice”, they said and added that of the 500 hero stones identified in the Kongu region, 90% of the stones do not carry any inscription. “Hero stones with inscriptions are highly significant”, they said.

Team members said that cultural values of Kongu region, along Amaravathi river bank at the southern Kongu region and Bhavani river bank at the northern Kongu region, are unspoken. “Currently very few historical monuments and traces can be seen where most others are gradually destroyed by day-to-day activities of people in these region”, they said and wanted more excavations to be done to unearth more history of the region.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ry2jiq/article32847375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB14GRINDSTONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/9th-century-grinding-stones-discovered-at-bhavani-taluk/article32847377.ece

With one month left for Deepavali, the shops at E.K.M. Abdul Gani Textile Market (Gani Market) in the city witnessed brisk sales on Tuesday.

The weekly market with 740 shops began on Monday night and went on till late Tuesday, as traders from across the State thronged the market and made bulk purchases.

“About 80% of the regular traders arrived at the market and the business was good,” said S. Sakthivel, secretary, Erode Gani Market Weekly Textile Trader’s Association. He told The Hindu that due to COVID-19 pandemic, traders from Karnataka did not turn up. “Merchants from various districts in the State visited the market and purchased materials for Deepavali,” he said.

While traders prefer Mumbai and Kolkata for readymade garments and Surat for saris, they buy dhotis from Erode, Salem and Namakkal districts and towels from Uttukuli in Tiruppur district. Other garments are from Tiruppur, he said.

Due to the return of workforce to North India, hike in price of yarn and closure of dyeing units, there is a 30% drop in overall production, he added. Mr. Selvaraj said that they expected good business for the next three weeks.

277,2020/10/13,‘Safety guidelines in place for drivers of free hearse service’,"Strict safety guidelines are in place for the drivers of the Government-operated free hearse service as they are at high risk of COVID-19 infection due to continuous exposure to hospital environment and mortuary.

The Government has supplied personal safety kits, N95 masks, disinfectant sprayer and PPEs to the drivers for their safety as they work in the forefront of COVID-19 management.

“Two out of the 12 mortuary vans operating in Coimbatore district are only used to transport people who died of COVID-19 to crematoriums and burial grounds. The vehicles are disinfected after every trip, while drivers who wear PPE during duty take bath after every trip. A geyser has been set up in their rest room at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) for their convenience. All the drivers are tested for the disease once in a week,” said P. Navinprabhu, district programme manager of free hearse service.

The 12 mortuary van drivers used to transport around 800 dead bodies from the hospital to the houses of the deceased a month before the spread of COVID-19. In September, they transported 1,300 dead bodies.

Drivers of the free hearse service and vans operated for mother and child under the Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) were given new mobile phones with dedicated numbers.

With Tiruppur district crossing the 10,000 mark in the total number of COVID-19 cases on Sunday, analysis of the data revealed that the district added over 1,000 fresh cases within a span of four to seven days since early September.

According to the data released by the State Government in the daily media bulletin, the district crossed the 3,000 mark on September 3, and 4,000 mark a week later on September 10. In another five days, the district crossed the 5,000-mark and on September 20 reached the 6,000 mark. It took only four more days for the district to cross the 7,000 mark, as the tally on September 24 was 7,024 cases. By month-end, it crossed the 8,000-mark. The 9,000-mark was crossed on October 6.

In contrast, the crossing of the 1,000 mark on August 5 took 136 days, given that the first COVID-19 case was reported in the district on March 23. The 2,000 mark was crossed on August 23, after a gap of 18 days.

279,2020/10/13,Coimbatore Corporation plans to open more MCCs to strengthen solid waste management,"Coimbatore Corporation will soon commission five more micro compost centres (MCCs) to strengthen solid waste management in the city.

The Corporation, as per Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian’s instruction, will start using the compost centres in Kavundampalayam dump yard, MGR wholesale vegetable market, Bharathi Park Road and two more to take the total number of compost centres in use to eight.

The Corporation had planned 69 MCCs across the city to decentralise waste collection – the plan was to take to the centres the wet, organic waste that conservancy workers collected from each centre’s neighbourhood to turn those to compost.

This, the Corporation said, would help it reduce the quantity of waste taken to the dump yard in Vellalore, save money on vehicles and fuel and force workers and people to strictly comply with segregated waste management.

But the Corporation could not complete construction of many of the MCCs. It had told the State Level Monitoring Committee of the National Green Tribunal for Solid Waste Management in Tamil Nadu in January this year that it would commission at least 12 MCCs by March 31.

The Corporation failed to stick to the deadline because of the COVID-19 induced lockdown, said sources, adding that now the plan was to open the five centres and ensure that in each of the five centres’ neighbourhood the civic body strengthened door-to-door segregated waste collection.

As a part of this strengthening drive, the Corporation had planned to buy more push carts, take early delivery of the small vehicles used for door-to-door collection and train conservancy workers.

Commissioner Mr. Pandian said the Corporation would train workers on the importance of segregated waste collection and how they could effectively enforce segregated collection from households.

As for the rest of the MCCs that were under various stages of construction, the sources said the Commissioner had instructed engineers to ensure early completion of work.

The Corporation’s move comes at a time when the Swachh Sarvekshan survey is only three months away.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/62pqm2/article32838235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB13SOLIDWASTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-corporation-plans-to-open-more-mccs-to-strengthen-solid-waste-management/article32838236.ece
280,2020/10/13,"Private hospitals, labs should support government’s efforts in containing COVID-19: Velumani","Laboratories told to alert the administration about persons testing positive

Private hospitals treating COVID-19 patients and laboratories testing samples should support the State Government’s efforts in containing the infection spread, Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani said here on Monday.

A release quoting from his speech at a review meeting he held at the Coimbatore Collectorate said he wanted the private hospitals to provide quality care to COVID-19 patients at the fee fixed by the Government.

As for laboratories authorised to test samples, he said they should do the tests at the rate fixed by the government and also report the results without delay.

If a person turned positive, the laboratories should report it to the administration and also ensure that the patient reached a hospital.

The district administration lifted 7,000 samples a day and this had helped contain the COVID-19 spread. The fever clinics and the door-to-door survey to identify persons with symptoms also helped in checking the spread.

Thus far, the administration had conducted 13,747 fever clinics and screened 15.36 lakh persons.

Of the 4.40 lakh samples lifted to check for COVID-19, 37,117 had tested positive. And, of these cases, 31,709 persons had returned home after treatment, the release said.

The Minister urged the officials concerned to be prepared for the north-east Monsoon by taking steps to mitigate the impact of floods, inundation and spread of water-borne diseases. And, if they conducted disaster management drill, he wanted the officials to ensure adherence to the physical distancing norm.

The release said the Minister asked the Coimbatore Corporation officials to keep ready motors to flush out water from underpasses and low-lying areas.

283,2020/10/13,"Indian Premier League 2020 | I am very sure about my role when playing for Australia, it changes frequently in IPL: Maxwell","The 31-year-old Kings XI Punjab batsman came to the IPL on the back of a successful tour of England

Australian big-hitter Glenn Maxwell has attributed his inconsistent run in the IPL over eight seasons to frequent changes in his role, something that is very clear to him when playing for his country.

The 31-year-old Kings XI Punjab batsman came to the IPL on the back of a successful tour of England, where he smashed a 90-ball 108 batting at number seven to script a memorable series-winning run chase alongside Alex Carey.

Speaking to PTI from Dubai, the Victorian explained why he has realised his potential while playing for Australia and the reason for his inconsistent run in the IPL.

“I probably would not (compare IPL and Australia career). The way I have played international cricket, it has been more of a clearer role. I know exactly how the guys will bat around me,” he said.

Having overcome mental health issues last year, it seems Maxwell is back to his best in international cricket. However, the same can’t be said about his IPL performances -- he has scored 58 runs at 14.50 in seven games so far.

Due to his exploits for Australia, Maxwell has always been sought after in the IPL and most recently KXIP bought him back by paying a whopping Rs 10.75 crore at the auction.

“My role in IPL changes probably for most games. In IPL, a lot of teams change their sides a lot. In the Australian set-up we have the same eleven for most of the games, we all know our roles really well,” said Maxwell.

He is batting at five for KXIP this season and said his role is to support the top-four.

“When you are only together for two months in the year with IPL, there is going to be chopping and changing. You are always looking for that right team balance. The team you pick at the start of the tournament might not have the balance you think as you progress.

“We feel we are getting closer to that (team balance). I have have had different experiences (in the IPL) where I have not quite performed to the level people expect but there has been no lack of trying, (or) putting the effort in training.”

Though Maxwell’s 552 runs in the 2014 edition helped KXIP reach their only final appearance till date, he enjoyed the most in the 2017 season when he was captain.

“Despite the fact I did well in 2014, I actually thought my performance in 2017 was my best season. Being captain, man of the match multiple times and I bowled a lot more.

“I thought that was my best season in the IPL. I was able to combine some match-winning knocks with some mature knocks,” he said referring to the year when he scored 310 runs at a strike-rate of 173 and took seven wickets at an impressive economy rate of 6.57.

The following season, he played for Delhi and did not do anything noteworthy. He did not take part in last year’s IPL.

With the top-four facing most of the balls, Maxwell feels he has not got enough time in the middle to make an impact. On the bowling front, he has got the opportunity to roll his arm over only thrice in seven games

“This year has been a different role (batting at five) and I am trying to get used to it. I would like to think that I have tried to do my role as well as I can.

“We have got Nicky (Nicholas Pooran) batting unbelievably well at four. With his power-hitting, my job has been to get him on strike and be there to help finish off games.

“I have been not out four times (three actually) in seven games which is probably never happened to me in the history of my career. So, it has been a strange transition for me batting at five and one that I feel, I have started to become more accustomed to.”

Would he want to bat higher up the order?

“With they way the team is set up there is no position there for me. As I said, my role at the moment is to put the icing on the cake and help our guys in the top four. There have been limited opportunities for me to bat.

“It has been a learning experience for sure...it is nice to be able to challenge myself with something different. I certainly have not been too hard on myself for my result in this tournament,” Maxwell added.

He has also been surprised by the slow nature of pitches in the UAE, having played here for Australia as well as the IPL back in 2014.

“The wickets have probably surprised me a little bit in terms of the way they have played. I have had a lot of success here in international cricket and even last the IPL.

“The wickets have been a little bit slower. The spin has not been as consistent. It has been probably easier for guys to bat at the top of the order than someone to come out and hit from ball one.

“It has not been easy and we have seen that consistently through the tournament.”

With six losses in seven games, every game is a must-win for KXIP from here on.

“It has been a tough campaign for us as a team. I would say we were ahead in a lot of those close games but unfortunately came short.

Chennai Super Kings successfully defended a target of 168 to record its third win of the season, beating Sunrisers Hyderabad by 20 runs at the Dubai International Stadium on Tuesday.

In a throwback to its tried and tested formula when playing in Chepauk, CSK used a decent total and the skills of its spinners to apply pressure in the middle overs and script a crucial win that gives its campaign a new lease of life.

For SRH, Kane Williamson waged a lonely battle with 57 off 39 balls (7x4).

CSK struck in the fourth over when Sam Curran removed David Warner cheaply, caught and bowled, before Dwayne Bravo’s direct hit found Manish Pandey short of his crease three balls later.

From 40 for two at the end of the PowerPlay, Ravindra Jadeja and Karn Sharma kept things tight without conceding a boundary till the last two deliveries of the 12th over. The left-arm spinner also removed Jonny Bairstow in this phase.

Dhoni took a gamble in bowling Karn in the 18th over, when he went for 19 but he removed Williamson which proved vital in the end.

Earlier, electing to bat for the first time this year, CSK made 167 for six thanks to an 81-run stand between Shane Watson (42) and Ambati Rayudu (41) for the third wicket.

CSK had Curran open the innings and the move paid dividends as the England all-rounder sparkled with a 21-ball 31 (2x4, 3x6).

After the departure of the openers, Watson and Rayudu rebuilt the innings, being circumspect against Rashid Khan and Shahbaz Nadeem initially. The two batsmen were lucky too as they were dropped when on nine and 20 respectively.

Watson and Rayudu looked like they would make SRH pay for the lapses as they waded into Rashid in his final two overs striking three sixes against the leggie.

However, both Rayudu and Watson mistimed full tosses and exited. But Dhoni’s 13-ball 21 (2x4, 1x6) and Jadeja’s unbeaten 25 (10b, 3x4, 1x6) helped CSK regain the momentum, as the last five overs produced 51.

However, Super Kings would rue the fact that their key batsmen, including Dhoni, fell tamely to full tosses and fell a little short of what they would have liked to finish with. The Chennai side would be happy with the fact that it chose an extra bowler Piyush Chawla instead of batsman N. Jagadeesan.

285,2020/10/13,Hearing into Salim Malik’s request for cricketing return concludes; decision in 15 days,"Malik and his lawyer, Saood Cheema told the media after the hearing that they were confident their request would be accepted.

The hearing into tainted former Pakistan cricket captain Salim Malik’s appeal seeking permission to become a coach has been completed by a PCB-appointed independent adjudicator, who will announce his judgement in 15 days’ time.

Malik and his lawyer, Saood Cheema told the media after the hearing that they were confident their request would be accepted.

Malik is being heard by Justice (read) Fazal Miran Chohan, who was appointed by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

He has stated that since the match-fixing life ban imposed on him by the board in 2000 has been revoked by a lower court, he should be allowed to get involved in cricket again as he wants to become a coach.

The board has not given Malik permission as yet and asked him to respond to questions regarding a meeting he held with some people in London in 2000 in which allegedly fixing of matches and players was discussed.

“For the first time the PCB today produced the original ICC letter on the basis of which this case against my client of having a negative role in the transcript of the meeting which was recorded in 2000 was made,” Cheema said.

He claimed the ICC itself had not verified the transcript.

But sources said that the PCB got the tapes verified and on Monday, the board’s legal counsel, Tafazzul Rizvi submitted them with original cassettes to the adjudicator.

“I had not accepted the transcript as it is a pack of lies. And now the ICC letter, which was presented by the PCB for the first time before the adjudicator, also mentions that it (transcript) has no authenticity,” Malik said.

But he said he was happy that an in-depth discussion was held during the hearing and hoped that a decision will come in his favour in the next 15 days.

Malik, who played 103 Tests and 283 ODIs, was banned for life for match-fixing on the recommendations of the Justice Malik Qayyum judicial commission.

It was in 2011 that the PCB first got hold of the transcript and cassettes from the ICC about the meeting in London and by that time Malik claimed a lower court had cleared his life ban in 2008.

“For the last 20 years I have been fighting for my right but they (PCB) are pushing me from one side to another...I hope by now many things have been cleared and the decision will come in my favour,” Malik said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i2lojc/article32843171.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SALIMMALIK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/hearing-into-salim-maliks-request-for-cricketing-return-concludes-decision-in-15-days/article32843172.ece
286,2020/10/13,Indian Premier League 2020 | Rajasthan eyes revenge against Delhi in return clash,"Delhi Capitals had beaten Rajasthan Royals by 46 runs last week.

Bolstered by the arrival of Ben Stokes, Rajasthan Royals will hope for a stronger show from its slightly off-colour top order when the side tries to settle scores against second-placed Delhi Capitals in their return leg IPL match in Dubai on Wednesday.

The Capitals had beaten RR by 46 runs last week and Steve Smith’s men will look to return the compliment when they meet for the second time in the tournament.

The last time the two teams clashed, RR didn’t have Stokes in the ranks and even though the England all-rounder didn’t set the stage on fire in his first game but his presence inspired the former champions to snap a four-match losing streak with a five-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad.

“With Stokesy back, it brings a nice balance to us. He just bowled one over as he just got out of a lockdown and is just working back into things,” Smith had said.

While Stokes will be an important cog in the RR wheel, the team will also have to fix its top order which has been short of runs in the last five games, leaving too much for the lower-order to get.

Skipper Smith and Sanju Samson have failed to make any significant contribution with the bat since setting the Sharjah ground on fire in their first two matches.

Jos Buttler produced a superb 44-ball 70 against Mumbai Indians but didn’t capitalise on the starts in the last two matches.

In fact, if it wasn’t for Rahul Tewatia, the Royals would still be in the dumps. The all-rounder, who had blasted five sixes against Kings XI Punjab, once again rescued RR with a 28-ball 45 in their last game against Sunrisers.

Delhi, on the other hand, were brought down by Mumbai Indians in their last game and Shreyas Iyer’s men will look to shrug off the odd defeat and get back to the top with a professional display.

The Capitals possess an explosive batting department as well as a formidable bowling unit with Kagiso Rabada emerging as the best bowler this season, snaring 17 wickets so far.

He has been supported well by fellow South African pacer Anrich Nortje (8 wickets) and Harshal Patel.

Ravichandran Ashwin too has bowled well in the power-play and along with Axar Patel, has done well to suffocate the opposition teams.

However, it was Marcus Stoinis, whose all-round show floored RR in their last face-off and Smith would hope that his side has his match in Stokes.

In bowling, Jofra Archer has led the charge for RR. He, along with the spin duo of Tewatia and Shreyas Gopal, have consistently figured in the XI, which has gone through a lot of chopping and changing.

For DC, Shikhar Dhawan’s return to form further boosts their batting order, featuring Prithvi Shaw and Iyer in the top four.

However, with wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant ruled out for a week due to a hamstring injury, DC have been forced to drop Shimron Hetmyer and include Australian Alex Carey.

It also gave Ajinkya Rahane his first match of this IPL.

Teams:

Rajasthan Royals: Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes, Sanju Samson, Andrew Tye, Kartik Tyagi, Steven Smith (c), Ankit Rajpoot, Shreyas Gopal, Rahul Tewatia, Jaydev Unadkat, Mayank Markande, Mahipal Lomror, Oshane Thomas, Riyan Parag, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Anuj Rawat, Akash Singh, David Miller, Manan Vohra, Shashank Singh, Varun Aaron, Tom Curran, Robin Uthappa, Aniruddha Joshi, Jofra Archer.

287,2020/10/13,Indian Premier League | Keeping it simple has made Washington a difficult bowler,"He grabbed two wickets in two overs against KKR on Monday.

Washington Sundar has stifled batsmen at this IPL. He has an economy rate of 4.9, after sending down 22 overs of off-spin in seven matches.

He may have taken only five wickets so far, but he has done his bit in Royal Challengers Bangalore’s rise to the third spot at the half-way mark.

In the 82-run victory against Kolkata Knight Riders on Monday, he took two wickets, including that of the dangerous Eoin Morgan.

After the match, the 21-year-old revealed the reason why he had been so good. “I have just wanted to keep things simple and hit the hard length,” he said. “That is something that has worked for me this season. I didn’t want to try too many things because we were playing in Sharjah.”

Washington said the team management felt the spinners would get assistance from the wickets in the UAE. About Sharjah, he said: “The wicket slowed down a bit. We felt it would before the start of the game.”

Stunning knock

He added that the stunning knock of A.B. de Villiers made all the difference against KKR, when RCB was thinking a score of 160 would be very good. But the South African’s 73 not out (33b) gave the team much more.

“The way he batted any (bigger) ground would not have made the difference,” said Washington.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/302vbk/article32841803.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WASHINGTONSUNDAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/getting-rewarded-for-keeping-things-simple-sundar/article32841804.ece

Senior Kings XI Punjab batsman Chris Gayle is likely to play his first game in the ongoing on Thursday after recovering from a bout of food poisoning.

Head coach Anil Kumble had said that the team could not play Gayle against Sunrisers Hyderabad last week because he was down with food poisoning. The 41-year-old also missed the following game against KKR on Saturday.

The ‘Universe Boss’ had even posted a photo on social media from his hospital bed.

KXIP posted photos of Gayle returning to the nets on Monday.

“He is fine now and it is likely that he will be playing the game against RCB (on Thursday),” a team source told PTI.

The game is at Sharjah, the smallest among the three venues and ideal for someone like Gayle to go on a six-hitting spree.

With the team having a set opening pairing in Mayank Agarwal and K L Rahul, Gayle has sat on the sidelines so far.

289,2020/10/13,"IPL 2020 | De Villiers made it look easier, says Dinesh Karthik","The South African veteran changed gears in the last five overs, smashing six sixes and five fours in an unbeaten 73 off 33 balls to set up an 82-run win for Royal Challengers Bangalore

Dinesh Karthik said that seasoned Royal Challengers Bangalore batsman AB de Villers’ belligerent unbeaten knock of 73 from just 33 balls took the match away from Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League at Sharjah on Monday.

The KKR skipper was gracious enough to praise de Villiers after his team lost by 82 runs, chasing 195 on a slower track. “Sometimes he (AB) is a really hard batsman to bowl to because of the way he moves around the crease. But today he stood still and made sure that he cleared his left leg and got a lot of balls outside the ground. It was not that easy to bowl to him, but kudos to him for the way he batted,” said Karthik in the post-match press conference.

“We had opportunities to create a little bit of inroads but they got away with a few shots…AB de Villiers showed why he is a very good player. Time and again to come out and score 80 runs off the (last) five overs is not easy, but he made it look much easier than what it was.”

RCB scored 83 runs in the last five overs.

Karthik defended the decision to field Englishman Tom Banton as an opener, replacing a ‘versatile’ batsman Rahul Tripathi. “Once you play Banton, you’ve got to make sure that he opens because that's where he is best at… He has opened in international cricket and has done well,” said Karthik.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/vzxtkg/article32841242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEVILLLIERS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-de-villiers-made-it-look-easier-says-dinesh-karthik/article32841196.ece
290,2020/10/13,Indian Premier League 2020 | Virat Kohli describes ABD’s knock as “superhuman” effort,"The guile of the spin duo of Yuzvendra Chahal (1/12) and Washington Sundar (2/20) were instrumental in stifling KKR.

Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli on Monday described team-mate AB de Villiers’ 33-ball 73 not out which set up a comprehensive win against Kolkata Knight Riders as “superhuman” effort, saying every other batsmen had struggled on the dry Sharjah pitch.

RCB registered a massive 82-run win on the back of de Villiers’ batting pyrotechnics and the guile of the spin duo of Yuzvendra Chahal (1/12) and Washington Sundar (2/20) who were instrumental in stifling KKR to 112 for 9 while chasing a target of 195.

“This pitch was drier. And the day was pleasant so we thought there would be no dew. Barring one superhuman, every batsman struggled on the pitch. The talk was around getting 165, but we got 194 you know exactly why. It was unbelievable,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.

“I thought I had a few balls under my belt, and I might start striking. He (de Villiers) just came in and struck the third ball, and said he felt good. You might see a lot of people do what is done in other games, but only AB can did what he did. It was a fabulous knock.”

Kohli, who remained not out on 33 from 28 balls, said it was only thanks to the genius of de Villiers that his side got to 194 for 2.

“I was happy we could string together a partnership (of 100 runs), and mine was the best seat to watch from.”

Talking about the win, Kohli said, “It is a tremendous win against a very strong side. Heading into a busy week for us, it was important to start off well. The bowling unit looks that much more potent with Chris Morris coming back.”

De Villiers, who was adjudged man of the match, said he surprised himself with the stupendous knock.

“I got a duck last game, that is a terrible feeling. I am very happy that I contributed. I surprised myself today to be honest. We were headed towards 140-150, and I thought I might try for 160-165, but I was surprised we reached 194,” said the star South African batsman.

“The margins are very small when Cummins and Russell are running in, and you need to use every bit of energy in you to keep the momentum going. I felt that energy in the bus already.”

Asked about keeping wickets, he said, “Keeping is a different skill. I am working really really hard so that I am up to the mark. I want to be the best that there is.”

KKR skipper Dinesh Karthik admitted that de Villiers’ knock made all the difference in the match.

“AB is a world-class player. He is hard to stop. He was the difference between the two teams. We tried everything. The only ball was the perfect inswinging yorker. Anything else was going.

“We need to sit down. There are a few things we need to do better. Even if we had restricted them to 175, there are a few things we need to do better. Let’s be honest. Every captain has a day when things don’t go right. But there are a lot of good days I can remember as well, and I will stick on to them.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/z9hbk1/article32838616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABD-KOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-virat-kohli-describes-abds-knock-as-superhuman-effort/article32838617.ece

292,2020/10/13,"Centre should play ‘crucial role’ in curbing air pollution in north India, stubble burning: Manish Sisodia","The national capital’s air quality was in the “very poor” category in the morning, the first time this season, with calm winds and low temperatures allowing accumulation of pollutants

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday appealed to the Centre to play a “crucial role” in controlling pollution in north India and curb stubble burning.

The national capital’s air quality was in the “very poor” category in the morning, the first time this season, with calm winds and low temperatures allowing accumulation of pollutants.

“Stubble burning has started in neighbouring states and smoke has started reaching Delhi. The Delhi government has taken several measures to reduce pollution throughout the year but why is that suddenly when stubble burning begins everybody is concerned about pollution and nothing is done throughout the year,” Mr. Sisodia told reporters.

“We say it again and again that it is not just Delhi which is affected by pollution but whole of north India,” he said.

By the time smoke from crop residue burning reaches Delhi, its “intensity is somewhat reduced but imagine how badly it will be affecting people living in Punjab and Haryana where stubble burning is actually taking place”, the Deputy Chief Minister said.

Stubble burning is a contributor to air pollution and governments of various states, including Punjab and Haryana, have taken several steps like implementing stringent measures and providing farmers with machinery to process crop residue, to stop the practice.

The Centre should take responsibility, Mr. Sisodia said and appealed to “the (central) government to play a crucial role in controlling pollution in north India and also curb stubble burning“.

Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had also said that state governments should stop blaming each other and work together to find a solution to the issue of stubble burning, one of the major reasons for the yearly problem of poor air in Delhi-NCR during winters.

Mr. Kejriwal said while farmers of neighbouring states and people of Delhi are bearing the brunt of stubble burning, governments have shut their eyes .

The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi has said that an increase in farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions of Pakistan is also going to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR.

The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 304 at 9:30 am, which falls in the very poor category. The 24-hour average AQI was 261 on Monday, the worst since February. It was 216 on Sunday and 221 on Saturday.

Wazirpur (AQI 380), Vivek Vihar (AQI 355) and Jahangirpuri (AQI 349) recorded the highest pollution levels.

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’

A senior scientist at the Delhi Pollution Control Committee said the dip in the air quality can be attributed to low wind speed and temperatures which allowed accumulation of pollutants.

“Stubble burning has also increased in neighbouring states. Also, the ventilation index is low, he said.

Ventilation index is the speed at which pollutants can get dispersed. A ventilation index lower than 6000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aye9j2/article32602640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANISHKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/centre-should-play-crucial-role-in-curbing-air-pollution-in-north-india-stubble-burning-sisodia/article32843654.ece

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said state governments should stop blaming each other and work together to find a solution to the issue of stubble burning, one of the major reasons for the yearly problem of poor air in Delhi-NCR during winters.

Mr. Kejriwal said while farmers of neighbouring States and people of Delhi are bearing the brunt of stubble burning, governments have shut their eyes .

State governments should stop blaming each other. We have to work together to find a solution to the issue All agencies and governments need to take it seriously now, he told reporters in Hiranki village in Narela where the spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer solution started on Tuesday.

The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and, therefore, can prevent stubble burning.

Mr. Kejriwal said that if the Delhi government can make efforts to prevent stubble burning, so can other state governments.

When the process was in its initial phase, I made attempts to contact the Central government and if they wanted, they could have worked with us to address the issue, he said.

We got to know about the technology developed by the Pusa Institute in September, and so did they. We have to work together with sincerity, he said.

The Pusa bio-decompose’ is being sprayed free of cost in around 800 hectares of land in Delhi where non-basmati rice is grown.

The Chief Minister said he was worried about farm fires in neighbouring states.

“The smoke has started affecting Delhi’s air quality Air pollution was under control for the last 10 months, but it has started increasing again, he said.

Imagine the impact of stubble burning on the families of farmers who have no option but to burn the crop residue. Farmers don’t burn it willfully, he said.

While the farmers of neighbouring states and the people of Delhi are bearing the brunt of stubble burning, governments have shut their eyes. I hope that they take concrete steps so that the entire north India gets rid of high levels of air pollution, he said.

The national capital’s air quality hit the very poor category on Tuesday morning, the first time since February, with calm winds and low temperatures allowing accumulation of pollutants.

According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, an increase in farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions of Pakistan is also going to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR.

NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of fires near Amritsar and Firozpur in Punjab and Patiala, Ambala and Kaithal in Haryana.

294,2020/10/13,"Granted bail, still in jail","Family of Noor Mohammed unable to furnish surety for his release

Noor Mohammed, a 30-year-old resident of Sonia Vihar, has been granted bail in all the nine cases registered against him in connection with the north-east Delhi riots, but he is still lodged in jail because his family is unable to furnish the surety for his release.

On October 5, a Delhi court granted bail to Mr. Mohammed in three cases of rioting, vandalisation and causing mischief by fire among other charges, stating that “he cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity just on the ground that the investigations of the cases are going on”.

However, seven days after the order, the accused is lodged in jail because his family is unable to arrange a surety of approximately ₹1.75 lakh — ₹20,000 each for eight cases and ₹15,000 for one.

Arrested on March 31

Mr. Mohammed’s advocate Akhtar Shamim said his client was first arrested in a case of robbery, arsoning and damage to public property on March 31 and later “implicated in eight other cases on the basis of his own disclosure statement”.

Mr. Mohammed’s wife Fatima Begum, 22, claimed she has no collateral to produce. “I don’t own anything that’s worth this amount and Noor’s parents are not in a position to help. His brothers are also not helping. At the moment, I don’t know whom to ask for collateral amounting to ₹1.75 lakh,” she said.

295,2020/10/13,Day 1 of DU online admission process sees 19K applications,"Most colleges happy with DU portal, some faced glitches viewing marksheets

On the first day of admissions for merit-based undergraduate courses, Delhi University (DU) received over 19,000 applications to various colleges. University officials said around 1,628 students were approved while 920 have paid the fees.

Keeping in mind the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the admission process is entirely online, including verification of documents, and students have been advised to not visit college campuses.

The portal opened at 10 a.m. on Monday and will remain available to applicants till 5 p.m. on Wednesday. Due to the rolling process, college-specific data regarding applications and admissions were not available.

Hindu College principal Anju Srivastava said, “We got quite a number of applications but cannot give exact data as it is a continuous process. We are processing applications, but we cannot give an exact number at the moment.”

At Lady Shri Ram College, which has set 100% cut-off for psychology, economics and political science, principal Suman Sharma said that several applications had been received for the courses. “We have received quite a few applications for the three courses, especially political science. It is difficult for us to give data as we are still processing. We have approved some applicants already, while things are being clarified for others. All that I can say is that the rush at LSR is the usual,” she said.

Smooth process

Stating that the online admission process has remained largely smooth apart from a few glitches, Ms. Sharma added: “We were worried about the procedure but it was quite smooth. There were some minor glitches but we coordinated with DU. They had given us a comprehensive list of people who we could contact.”

Meanwhile, approximately 600 applications were processed at Gargi College till 6 p.m. while around 126 admissions took place at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College. Ramjas College processed around 155 applications at the department level while 25 applications were approved by the principal till 6.30 p.m.

Regarding verification of documents, Ramjas College principal Manoj Khanna said: “There were some issues with viewing the CBSE marksheet as it was not visible for some applications. Hence, it was becoming difficult to verify the marksheets uploaded by students. We have raised the issue with the university.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vlbm7b/article32838695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12DELPRIYADU1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/day-1-of-du-online-admission-process-sees-19k-applications/article32838696.ece

After managing to evade the long arm of the law for over 30 years, three proclaimed offenders in a dacoity case were finally arrested by the police on Monday.

In the case that became infamous in the late 1980s, over a dozen armed men had laid siege to the house of a prominent moneylender, Swami Ram, in Punhana, and decamped with 1 kg of gold, 150 kg of silver and some cash. They also shot his neighbour Jagdish Patel.

Nuh police arrested three of those accused from U.P.’s Bulandshahar on Monday. The moneylender, Swami Ram’s, neighbour Jagdish Patel was shot in the neck during the dacoity.

As part of its special campaign against proclaimed offenders and those who have jumped bail, the police stumbled upon the records of the three accused in the 33-year-old dacoity case in Pinangwan village.

“The accused — Yaseen, Babu and Manjoor Ahmed — were declared proclaimed offenders in 1988 and were leading normal lives in their respective villages. Two of the accused were held soon after the dacoity in 1987. The other 10 accused are now dead,” said Superintendent of Police (Nuh) Narendra Bijarniya.

Recounting the horror, Naresh Singla, one of the sons of Mr. Ram, told The Hindu that around 30 armed dacoits had laid siege to their house at 10 p.m.

“Some construction work was going on in our housea few of the dacoits climbed up the terrace via the scaffolding. They then opened the door to allow their accomplices inside. When the villagers tried to raise an alarm, the dacoits opened fire at them. One of our neighbours was killed and many sustained bullet and shrapnel injuries,” said Mr. Singla, 53.

An undergraduate then, Mr. Singla recalled how there were no means of communication and the police reached only in the morning. The police station, he said, was around 10 km from their house. “Two men were arrested, but the rest managed to flee. Though the dacoits came from Uttar Pradesh, we suspected that someone known to us was involved. The entire conspiracy was never unravelled though,” The police recovered only six kg of silver then.

The family was pushed into huge financial distress, said Mr. Singh, adding that they had to sell sold their landholdings. to overcome the crisis.

298,2020/10/13,Adarsh Nagar murder witness claims police damaged her SIM,"She has accused police of inaction in the case; DCP denies all allegations

Delhi Police personnel allegedly damaged the SIM card of the 21-year-old woman who has accused the police of inaction in the October 7 murder case of Rahul Rajput in Adarsh Nagar.

The woman, who has become a witness in the case, made a video call from her phone on Sunday and alleged police inaction when she approached them after Rahul was attacked by her brother and cousins.

The second-year student at Delhi University’s School of Open Learning was allegedly beaten to death by the woman’s relatives.

On Sunday afternoon, the woman had called up a police personnel related to the case and requested that she be allowed to meet Rahul’s parents otherwise she would go to the media for help.

Around 8 p.m., three police personnel, including a woman in civvies, reached the shelter home where the woman is staying.

“On pretext of getting some details in the case, they took my phone. Two other policemen engaged me in some paperwork and the woman somehow damaged my SIM card. When I found there was no network in my phone and confronted the police personnel, they left the shelter home,” said the woman on a video call to a friend.

‘Forced to write’

She alleged that the policemen asked her to write on paper that she is getting full support from the police.

She allegedly followed their instructions in the hope that she would get help in the investigation of the case.

The police personnel left after allegedly promising her a new SIM card, but she has allegedly not received anything yet. She managed a call up a friend with the help of the shelter home’s warden.

DCP (North West) Vijayanta Arya has denied the allegations made by the woman about the conduct of the police personnel.

Rahul and the woman are said to have known each other for three months. The woman’s brother was against their relationship as they belonged to different faiths.

Meanwhile, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday said that the party would launch a protest if action is not taken against police personnel for allegedly not saving Rahul. The party added that the police destroyed the woman’s SIM card so that they and the BJP would not be “exposed”.

300,2020/10/13,"Hand over any hospitals that you are unable to run, govt. tells civic bodies","Municipalities told to submit report to Satyendar Jain

Delhi’s Urban Development (UD) Department on Monday wrote a letter to the three municipal corporations asking them to consider handing over their hospitals to the Delhi government if they are unable to pay salaries of staff or are facing difficulties in running the institutes.

The Department, in a letter addressing the Commissioners of the civic bodies, raised concerns regarding the non-payment of salaries, wages and other dues to the doctors, medical, paramedical and other staff working in the Hindu Rao and Kasturba Hospital under the North body.

The letter said civic bodies should “expeditiously” clear the salaries of the medical staff and in case they are unable to do so, they must consider handing over their hospitals to the Delhi government.

“Resident doctors’ association of the above-mentioned hospitals have threatened to go on strike if their dues are not cleared on time. The civic bodies have failed to meet the deadlines. The situation has led to inconvenience and improper treatment to COVID-19 patients,” said UD Minister Satyendar Jain.

“It is evident that the civic bodies are finding difficulty in proper running management of their hospitals, which has led anguish among doctors and paramedical staff and inconvenience to patients' relatives/citizens of Delhi during ongoing pandemic and treatment of non-COVID-19 ailments,” he added.

The letter also stated: “Serious concerns have been raised regarding non-payment of salaries/wages/other dues to the medical, paramedical and other staff working in Hindu Rao Hospital, Kasturba Hospital and other hospitals of civic bodies. It has been mentioned that inability to pay the salaries and other dues in time has led to a situation where proper treatment to COVID-19 patients is not being given and they are forced to shift from Hindu Rao Hospital to Lok Nayak Hospital of GNCTD for a continuum of medical care.”

Under the recommendations of the 5th Delhi Finance Commission, the letter stated, the first and second installments of Basic Tax Assignment (BTA) by the UD Department and Grant-in-aid (GIA) by Health and Education Departments have already been released to the DMCs by Delhi Government for Financial Year 2020-21.

Apart from these released amounts, it also stated, the DMCs have their own sources of revenue generation and thus have to ensure sufficient provisioning of funds to pay the salaries for the frontline health workers in DMC hospitals during the pandemic.

Following a plea challenging an order passed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) which imposed an environmental compensation of ₹3 lakh for violation of environmental norms by a MSME unit, the National Green Tribunal observed that the compensation assessed by the DPCC was “disproportionate” and reduced it to ₹25,000.

A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “We are of the view that having regard to the fact that the unit is a small one and violation was marginal which was later rectified to the satisfaction of the DPCC, we are of the view that compensation assessed is disproportionate... having regard to the entirety of the matter, we reduced the compensation to ₹25,000”.

The protests, held by the Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS) and Students’ Federation of India (SFI), termed the cut-offs as “discriminatory” and “exclusionary” and demanded scrapping of the same.

“This cut-off is nothing but a policy of educational apartheid meant to keep public-funded higher education beyond the reach of students from government schools, an overwhelming number of whom hail from socio-economically deprived backgrounds,” the KYS said in a statement.

The students’ group further said, “Students from marginalised and vulnerable sections find their access to quality education barred due to paucity of seats and consequent high cut-offs. The KYS demands more seats, low cut-offs and enabling policies such as deprivation points.”

305,2020/10/13,Owner of app-based taxi aggregator firm arrested for duping investors,"Accused lured over 900 people by promising high returns

A 47-year-old woman was arrested from south Goa for allegedly duping people by inducing them to invest in her app-based taxi aggregator company on the pretext of assured high returns, the police said on Monday.

Others involved

The police said one Dharmender, along with other victims, accused a company called SMP Impex Pvt. Ltd. (Hello Taxi) and its office-bearers Saroj Mahapatra, Rajesh Mahto, Sunder Bhati, Harish Bhati, and the woman director of cheating them by inducing them to invest in their company Hello Taxi and promised to pay higher rate of interest, up to 200%, on a monthly basis.

However, they neither paid the interest nor returned the money. There were more than 900 investors so far and the amount involved is around ₹250 crore, said the police.

“During investigation, it was found that the directors of the company actively induced the victims to part with their money on the pretext of high returns by investing in Hello Taxi company,” Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW) O.P. Mishra said.

The company accepted bookings from the investors without taking approval from the authorities concerned like RBI or SEBI, the police said.

They initially paid returns to the investors to win their confidence, but later stopped the payments after collecting huge amounts, and escaped, the police said.

The locations of the company also changed frequently to trap new victims.

Initially, the company started its operation from Ghaziabad. After a couple of months, they shifted to Patparganj Industrial Area and then Sector 16 in Rohini, Mr. Mishra said.

The firm’s bank accounts were frozen after scrutiny of statements. Over ₹3.27 crore of cheated money was found. Sixty new cars worth ₹3.5 crore purchased from the cheated amount were seized at Noida, the police said. Rajesh Mahto was arrested on August 23, the police said.

Several teams were constituted to trace and nab the accused persons. On the basis of secret information, the police apprehended the woman from south Goa, Mr. Mishra said.

The university, which has been established through an Act of the Delhi Assembly, will impart skills and training to ensure that students easily get a job as soon as they pass out or can pursue a business.

“We have appointed a Vice-Chancellor and Board members. I spoke to all members and told them that the only objective and ideology of this university will be ensuring jobs for every student passing out from this institute, or they should be able to pursue business,” he said at a virtual briefing.

First Vice-Chancellor

Prof. Neharika Vohra has been appointed the Vice-Chancellor. She was the chairperson of the Centre for Innovation and Incubation at IIM Ahmedabad. Dr. Pramath Raj Sinha, who started Indian School of Business and Ashoka University, Pramod Bhasin who started Genpact in 1997, he started his skill centre and is a board member of many big companies in the country, he was the chairman of NASSCOM and was awarded as the IT Man of the Year.

First are those who do not receive education, and second are those who are unemployed even after being educated,” he said.

307,2020/10/13,Assembly panel continues its proceedings against Facebook,"Witnesses stress need for grievance redressal mechanism

The Delhi Assembly’s Committee on Peace and Harmony continued proceedings related to grave allegations against social media platform Facebook here on Monday.

Prabir Purkaystha, editor of NewsClick and Pratik Sinha, co-founder of non- profit fact-checking website ‘Alt News’ were examined by the committee.

In a statement, the committee said, Mr. Purkaystha categorically deposed that there is “a direct correlation” between Facebook’s business model, which “purportedly thrives on hate for maximising its engagement thus leading to disturbing the peace and harmony.”

‘Thrives on virality’

The committee also stated that he also deposed that Facebook, through its business model allegedly thrives on “virality of hate as it catches more eyeballs” and curbing hateful content “does not incentivise them” on their platform.

He also deposed that there should be more effective measures undertaken by Facebook with respect to grievance redressal mechanism as persons sending their grievances must be entitled to know as to what fate their complaint met, the committee said.

Calls for transparency

According to the committee, Mr. Sinha stated that there is “a total opacity in the functioning and structure of Facebook” as there is “no transparency” in their operations.

He also cited various posts which were widely shared during recent Delhi riots but despite being declared as fake, still exist on the platform without any requisite mark of caution, indicating Facebook’s alleged “incompetency in eliminating fake content off its platform.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/assembly-panel-continues-its-proceedings-against-facebook/article32838451.ece
308,2020/10/13,HC advises Lt. Colonel to let his son choose his life path,"Court says father’s ambition doesn’t define standards for selection as Commissioned Officer in Army

Observing that it is not a father’s ambition that defines the standards for selection as a Commissioned Officer in the Indian Army, the Delhi High Court has rejected the plea of a young aspirant seeking to take him back in the training at the Indian Military Academy (IMA).

The aspirant’s father, a Lieutenant Colonel himself, had made a fervent plea to consider the case of his son leniently, as the commissioning of his son as an Officer of the Indian Army meant a lot to him as it would be the fourth generation from his family to join the Indian Army.

However, a Bench of Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Justice Asha Menon said that while it may be possible for them to sympathise with the Lieutenant Colonel, but the records reveal that the aspirant Dhruv Jakhar was finding it difficult to settle into the regimented and highly disciplined lifestyle at the IMA.

Absenteeism, lying

Mr. Jakhar used to absent himself from training and special and critical events by malingering or reporting sick. “It was this absenteeism and lying about the reasons for such actions that led to several of the punishments as also the Honour Code Committee being constituted against him,” the court noted.

“He was punished for misbehaviour too. Repeatedly he was found disregarding the chain of command and punishments did not seem to bring about the desired result,” the court said.

“Right from the first term till the third relegation, the petitioner [Mr. Jakhar] continued committing the same kind of offences which were in the areas most crucial to the Armed Forces, namely, building physical and mental strength and developing utmost and unquestioned discipline in following the orders of the superiors,” it added.

Non-disciplined lifestyle

The Bench said it was amply clear to them that Mr. Jakhar was not suited to a military lifestyle and possibly the desires of his father pushed him into this direction. “The father would be well advised to allow his son the freedom to choose his life path and allow him to blossom forth in whatever he so chooses, which is certainly not the Indian Army,” it added.

The High Court’s decision came on Mr. Jakhar’s plea seeking to quash the order to withdraw him from the IMA.

Mr. Jakhar had contended that the Honour Code Committee instituted against him was illegally constituted with members of the same battalion where he was training. He argued that as per the rules, they were supposed to be from different battalions to ensure transparency and prevent miscarriage of justice.

The Delhi High Court on Monday sought response from BJP leader Rajeev Babbar on a plea by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP leaders challenging summons issued to them in a defamation case for their alleged remarks over deletion of names from the voters’ list of the Capital.

The court has posted the case for further hearing on November 23. It had on February 28, this year stayed the defamation proceedings in the trial court.

The court said the issue has to be heard expeditiously in terms of a recent directions of the Supreme Court asking the chief justices of all High Courts to list before an appropriate Bench all pending criminal cases involving sitting and former lawmakers where stay was granted.

The Chief Minister and three others — AAP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Gupta and party leaders Manoj Kumar and Atishi Marlena — have sought quashing of a sessions court order, which upheld a magisterial court’s decision to summon them as accused in the complaint.

Mr. Babbar, on behalf of the Delhi unit of the party, sought the prosecution of AAP leaders for harming the reputation of the outfit by blaming it for the deletion of names from the voters’ list.

AAP leaders in their plea before the High Court have claimed that the trial court failed to appreciate that they did not make or publish any statement against Mr. Babbar or his party as alleged by him.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/70mqq2/article32838401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL13-CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/court-seeks-response-of-bjp-leader-on-plea-by-cm-3-others/article32838402.ece
310,2020/10/13,Activists blame Golconda bastion collapse on ‘unscientific’ upkeep,"Cracks were first noticed last month and a report sent to ASI chief, says official

The collapse of Golconda Fort’s Majnu Burj has triggered a wave of anger among civic activists and citizens. “This is a result of unscientific, unsystematic and ignorant upkeep of monuments. Who is supervising the structure that is classified as a national monument? What action will the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) now take,” asked Anuradha Reddy of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage.

The collapsed portion of the bastion fell on the golf course, pointed out Lubna Sarwath of Save Our Urban Lakes. “Why was the norm of 100-metre buffer zone ignored? This is a result of criminal negligence which will affect Hyderabad’s case for a World Heritage Site status,” she said. “Earlier when I visited the site, there was no access to the cannon. Later, the steps of the bastion were cleared of thorny bushes and a cement plastering was done on the steps leading to the top,” she informed putting into focus the nature of conservation effort at the monument that dates back to 1656.

The Majnu Burj and other structures were built after the Mughal attack on Golconda Fort in 1656. The raised rocky surface overlooking a lake was turned into a walled in bastion by the Golconda regime of Abdullah Qutb Shah.

The collapsed portion was cordoned off by the ASI officials on Tuesday. “We noticed the cracks in the bastion in the last week of September; there was a site inspection and a report was sent to Director-General office on October 7. Meanwhile, this happened,” said an ASI official.

The cracks were noticed by ASI officials as part of routine inspection following heavy rainfall in September. “We will have to first stabilise the structure before taking up repair work. It will be complicated as a part of the cannon has no support now. We have to consider the safety of the workers too,” said the ASI official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/70fkpk/article32850098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13-MAJNU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/activists-blame-golconda-bastion-collapse-on-unscientific-upkeep/article32847824.ece
311,2020/10/13,Incessant rain throws traffic out of gear in Hyderabad,"Several parts of Hyderabad waterlogged; potholes, cracked manholes and sand bars add to commuters’ woes

Traffic flow was disrupted due to incessant rain in the city on Tuesday, both during the morning and evening rush hour. Waterlogging, sand bars on roads, potholes and cracked manhole covers added to the chaos.

The road stretch near Ravindra Bharathi was closed during morning hours affecting traffic flow from Tank Bund to Nampally area. In many places including Masab Tank, Mehdipatnam, and Attapur, concrete manhole covers were damaged, forcing commuters to take evasive measures affecting traffic flow.

While a number of flyovers that dot the city provided temporary rain shelter to two-wheeler riders, it didn’t help moving traffic. “Notice the rainwater discharge pipes on the flyover? None of new SRDP flyovers built by MVR have good quality drains. Don’t even know how they keep getting contracts for all new flyovers,” posted one user on Twitter as others shared images of heavy outflow of water from the flyovers onto the roads.

Gachibowli in western Hyderabad received heavy rain since evening, resulting in waterlogging on roads and many pockets plunging into darkness as power supply was disrupted. Tall trees in some areas swayed dangerously as vendors packed up early for the day.

For most part of the day, however, the rain, often a steady drizzle, ensured people went about work as usual. With many IT campuses shut and the bustle missing at many commercial establishments, traffic remained nowhere near the pre-COVID levels, thus posing limited trouble to road users. Making it easier for the residents were also some of the new infrastructure developments such as the flyover and underground drains.

Tree falls

Parts of Secunderabad Cantonment areas were under a sheet of water. Traffic was disrupted from New Bowenpally to Tarbund Cross Roads as rain water overflowed near the Muslim graveyard.

Bumper to bumper traffic was witnessed from New Bowenpally to Tarbund. A tree got uprooted near Tarbund throwing traffic out of gear. Similarly, rainwater was overflowing near Old Bowenpally checkpost. Traffic police personnel were deployed to clear the traffic snarl.

Similar scenes were witnessed on the Suchitra Cross Roads to Old Alwal. An overflowing nala near Father Balaiah Nagar made it difficult for the motorists to drive on the flooded road. A big tree fell on the road in front of Begumpet traffic police station bringing traffic on the Begumpet to Paradise road to a grinding halt.

Padma Colony behind Shanker Mutt was completely under water. Kothi, Kachiguda and Narayanguda areas went without power from 7.30 p.m. Several colonies in Gachibowli were without power while gated community dependence on diesel generator backup was high.

Traffic police on toes

Traffic police stayed on their toes for most part of the day, clearing waterlogging points and sending out information about affected areas: “Slow movement of traffic from CTO Junction, Paradise Junction, Rocha Bazar, Ranigunj towards Karbala Maidan Road”; “Slow movement of traffic from Rasoolpura, Chutneys Begumpet, Fire Station towards Paradise X Road,” and “Waterlogged at Chitra Dargah Mahankali commuters kindly note and take alternate routes to reach destinations.”

The struggle with blocked drains didn’t stop even in the evening as Bahadurpura police pitched in to help DRF and GHMC teams to clear water pathways in the Puranapul area.

Twitter user Gulam Amer posted: “The Traffic Police in Hyderabad always help people. In rainy season I feel that they do more than GHMC.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/upiqs9/article32847797.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-RAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/incessant-rain-throws-traffic-out-of-gear/article32847778.ece
312,2020/10/13,Homeless struggle to find safe spaces,"Social workers call for more shelter homes

As rain continued to batter the city, people who could afford the luxury of being cooped up at home thanked their stars. However, for those who had to venture out, it was a nightmarish experience. The worst-affected were the homeless who huddled together under trees or in peripheries of buildings as the rain beat down throughout Monday night.

Social workers, who work for the welfare of the homeless, feared that they might suffer the same fate on Tuesday night too.

“Many people live on footpaths in Nampally and Secunderabad. They search for work at ‘addas’ there. Since it rained incessantly, three to four of them huddled together under trees, and the others scouted for locations wherever they thought would be dry and safe. They could not sleep throughout the night as it got cold and the direction of rain kept changing,” said a social worker seeking anonymity.

He said though shelter homes exist in some parts of the city, more such are needed in other localities such as Secunderabad, and Nampally.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/homeless-struggle-to-find-safe-spaces/article32847718.ece
313,2020/10/13,Restore alternate week quarantine: junior doctors,"‘Without it, cross-infection and re-infection among doctors may lead to sudden shutdown of all hospital departments’

Following an order revoking alternate week quarantine for healthcare professionals in government hospitals where non-COVID services are provided, members of the Telangana Junior Doctors Association-Osmania Medical College (TJUDA-OMC) have requested Health Minister Eatala Rajender for restoration of the provision.

In the past few months, healthcare staff were allowed to quarantine for a week followed by one week of work. The current staff was divided into batches to work on alternate weeks.

As non-COVID services too were resumed at government hospitals, Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy issued orders on October 9 stating that the quarantine provision had been withdrawn. However, the provision continues at Gandhi Hospital, District Hospital in King Koti, and Tata Institute of Medical Sciences, Gachibowli.

TJUDA-OMC members said COVID-19 cases among them are continuing to rise and that around 294 Post Graduate students and resident doctors had tested positive until Monday. They stated that if the alternate week of quarantine is not provided, there is a greater chance of cross infection and reinfection of all post graduates which may lead to sudden shutdown of all departments of the hospital.

“We have worked hard in this pandemic by risking our lives and managed all the cases while having alternate week quarantine. We request you to consider risk to our health and allow continuation of alternate week quarantine for all doctors till this pandemic ends,” the junior doctors requested.

Besides, OMC junior doctors requested provision of permanent operation theatres (OT) for General Medicine department. Though temporary OTs were provided, the department is able to perform only four to five surgeries a day. “We usually perform 10-12 surgeries a day. If a permanent OT is provided, it will reduce inconvenience to patients in need of surgery,” a junior doctor said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/restore-alternate-week-quarantine-junior-doctors/article32847692.ece
314,2020/10/13,Rain pours misery on Hyderabad residents; twin cities on high alert,"Several areas in city receive 10-20 cm rainfall

Nature’s fury doubled its wrath upon the city on Tuesday, the third day of unremitting spell of rain, keeping the city and civic authorities on high alert.

Torrential downpour, roads resembling ocean fronts, vehicles stranded on water logged stretches, menacing rush of water into low lying colonies, and imminent alarm bells for areas abutting the Musi river were common concerns across the metropolis, which received over 10 centimetres of rain at minimum across various localities. The thunderstorm which continued from the previous day, only intensified towards the evening, after a deceptive respite for a brief while in the morning hours.

As per information from the automatic weather stations installed in the city, by 9 p.m. on Tuesday, South Hastinapuram area of LB Nagar received the highest rainfall at 22.5 centimetre, followed by Hayatnagar and Rajiv Nagar in Kapra at 21 centimetre.

The stations at Dammaiguda, Peerzadiguda, Kushaiguda, Lingojiguda, Tarnaka, Kandikal Gate, Macha Bolarum, Ramanthapur, Cherlapally, Malkajgiri, Madhusudan Nagar, Rein Bazar, Habsiguda, Neredmet, Sardarmahal, West Marredpally, Monda Market, Mettuguda, among others received between 15 and 19 centimetre of rainfall. Very few localities remained where the rainfall was less than 10 centimetres, which in isolation indicates very heavy rain by city standards. Insufficient storm water drainage drove the water surge onto the roads and colonies, while officials were kept on tenterhooks with rising levels of lakes. With the threat imminent of rising water in Ramanthapur Pedda Cheruvu, and the spectre of inundation looming large, GHMC officials used pumps to de-water the lake on Monday night itself. Still, by Tuesday evening, the lake was back to the brim. Saroornagar lake too has started inching towards FTL, and with several encroachments on its surplus nala, officials have evacuated a few colonies and sheltered the residents in community halls.

Officials informed that with two minor water bodies Kappala Cheruvu and Bathula Cheruvu showing signs of overflowing, evacuations are in full force there. Disaster Response Force from the Disaster Management wing of GHMC had to use boats to evacuate citizens from inundated areas of Nadeem Colony in Tolichowki. Miyapur Metro station too was inundated, where the DRF teams have been pushed into service, apart from Rajbhavan stretch.Cars were washed away in Nadeem Colony, Tolichowki, while in Kalapather, a car was drowned completely, with the driver rescued by passersby.

Collapse of walls and structures was reported from multiple locations, including Shankar Nagar in Amberpet, Jhatpat Nagar in Chanchalguda, Adikmet and Dhoolpet areas. GHMC’s Town Planning wing has gone on an active demolition spree, bringing down structures in areas such as Moosa Bowli, Charminar, Lal Darwaza and other areas.

Still surplus water from Hussainsagar entered homes at several localities including the ever prone Padmanagar colony behind Shanker Mutt, Adikmet and Ashoknagar area. At Himayatsagar, the water level hovered about 1762.303 feet, against the FTL of 1763.5 feet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/7qoftu/article32849958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14HEAVYRAINS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rain-pours-misery-on-hyderabad/article32847128.ece
315,2020/10/13,Incessant rain disrupts power supply,"Restoration of supply done within a couple of hours in many cases, say officials

Incessant rain almost across the State throughout the day on Tuesday has caused disruptions in power supply mostly due to minor problems and it was restored within one to three hours in many cases. However, no major problems have been reported till the evening.

According to officials of the two power distribution companies, major reasons for interruptions in power supply were insulation bursting/damage, loose contact of service cables, rust and dust in conductor joints and fall of tree branches on the transmission and distribution conductor.

“As there was no heavy wind for most part of the day, the problems were fewer,” a senior official said adding that supply at feeder level was stopped as a precautionary measures at a few places when there was good wind velocity but was resumed after checking of transmission lines at key points.

In Hyderabad, there were instances of tree falls on transmission lines and bending of electrical poles in Mehdipatnam, Indira Park and Begumpet sections but the power supply was restored within hours either by restoring the affected lines or through alternative lines. Chairman and Managing Director of Southern Discom G. Raghuma Reddy stated that teams of 25 skilled personnel were kept on emergency duty in every section for attending to any emergencies in power supply.

Power supply interruptions due to minor reasons such as fusing at distribution transformers, insulation bursting and others were attended from time to time to restore the supply within a couple of hours of interruption at several places in the City, Southern Discom officials said. There were no instance of feeder failures in the Metro Zone but the Cyber City and Rajendranagar feeders were affected for a few hours in the Rangareddy Circle.

Mr. Raghuma Reddy asked people to contact phone numbers 1912, 100, local fuse call office, 7382072104, 7382072106 or 7382071574 for any power supply related issues including fluctuation in voltage, electrical poles and distribution transformers in pool of rainwater, snapped electrical conductor or any other problem. Residents of apartments with cellars have been told be cautious about rainwater storming of cellars.

Meanwhile, the power demand has slipped to less than 4,500 MW during the day on Tuesday from nearly 9,800 MW a week ago. Chairman and Managing Director of Transco/Genco D. Prabhakar Rao has instructed the engineers at load despatch centre to keep tab on demand fluctuation round the clock to maintain the grid frequency.

He explained that generation at all thermal units was backed down and only hydel generation was going on at major hydel stations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/9aaj9g/article32850075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13HYBCS02-RAIN-GOO7RU96Q3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/incessant-rain-disrupts-power-supply/article32845602.ece

318,2020/10/13,Rains prompt discharge of flood at all major dams,"Heavy rains likely to continue for next 2-3 days

Flood level in the river Krishna and many of its tributaries in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana has started rising owing to heavy to very heavy rains in their catchment areas and the discharge of flood at all major dams in the Basin has resumed after it was stopped about 10 days back.

While it resumed at some projects including Almatti, Narayanpur, Tungabhadra, Srisailam, Jurala, Pulichintala, Ujjani and few others on Sunday, it commenced at Nagarajunasagar and other dams on Monday.

The discharge of flood at Nagarjunasagar started at around 4 p.m. on Monday when the dam authorities lifted two crest gates for 10 feet height each to allow release of about 30,000 cusecs from the spillway.

By 8 p.m., the discharge of flood at Nagarjunasagar was increased to nearly 1.2 lakh cusecs as the number of spillway gates lifted increased to 8.

At 8.30 pm the discharge of flood from the spillway of Srisailam was nearly 1.68 lakh cusecs from six gates lifted for 10 ft height each as the inflows realised at the dam increased to nearly 1.88 lakh cusecs although the discharge of flood at Sunkesula, Jurala and from Handri was over 2.01 lakh cusecs.

An advisory issued by the Central Water Commission (CWC), citing the IMD forecast, stated that extremely heavy rainfall of over 20 cm per day is expected to occur at isolated places over north-central Maharashtra and heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places over south-central Maharashtra and Marathawada.

“Due to forecast rainfall, inflows into all dams in the Krishna Basin are likely to increase rapidly. River Krishna and its tributaries such as Bhima, Tungabhadra have started rising at many locations in the middle reaches. Inflows into Narayanpur and Tungabhadra dams have also started increasing,” CWC officials stated adding that the river Tungabhadra at Melaganur in Karnataka and Mantralayam in Andhra has also started rising.

Besides, the river Kagna, a tributary of Bhima, is rising at Malkhed in Kalaburagi district of Karnataka and it is expected to increase the inflows significantly into Jurala project in Telangana and Srisailam dam in AP-Talangana, it is stated in the CWC advisory.

“Since the rainfall is going to increase further all along the Krishna Basin for next the 2-3 days, and as all the dams in Krishna, Bhima and Tungabhadra sub-basins in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and AP are likely to discharge flood as storage in all the reservoirs is near full reservoir level (FRL)”, the CWC advisory stated.

Godavari Basin

As rainfall is expected all along the Godavari Basin for the next 2-3 days all the major reservoirs are likely to get good inflows in Maharashtra and Telangana.

As of Monday evening, the inflows into Sriramsagar were over 52,000 cusecs and that into Lower Manair dam were over 42,600 cusecs.

Inflows into Kaddam, Singur, Nizamsagar and Yellampally have also started rising on Monday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rains-prompt-discharge-of-flood-at-all-major-dams/article32838874.ece
319,2020/10/13,Telugu song ‘Ye Angadi Poyedi’ raises its voice against the new Farm Bill 2020,"Written by Anand Gurram, the folk style rendition is composed and sung by Shamanth Nag

A new Telugu song Ye angadi poyedi, ye retu ku ammedi supports farmers agitating against the new Farm Bill 2020. The folk rendition has words penned by Anand Gurram and is composed and sung by Shamanth Nag.

Compelling lyrics

“The song’s significance is its remarkable and hard-hitting lyrics depicting reality; I give credit to Anand for such powerful words,” says Shamanth. With compelling lines Yeddu gudda podisi nenu, yevasam edho chesthunte, gittu baatu nattivirigi, yaparam cheyamante, ye angadi poyedi, ye retuku ammedi (I am cultivating my land by kicking the back of my oxen, but if I am compelled to do business by not giving even the production cost, how can I survive? Where can I go and sell my produce for what rates can I sell my produce), the video has photographs of farmers toiling in the fields.

Shamanth Nag | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

This qualified lawyer-turned-musician keeps himself updated with legal news and the bills passed in Parliament. “Since I have studied law I could understand terms that regular people cannot see and felt a few points in the Farm Bill were not in favour of farmers,” he points out adding SK Srinivas of ChowRaasta band (Shamanth’s brother Yashwanth Nag is a singer and keyboard player in the ChowRaasta band) approached him with a song.

Calling it a ‘call and response’ composition, Shamanth explains, “This is a folk compositional structure where a person sings the first line and others respond to it in a chorus.” Instead of using only dappu — a traditional accompanying instrument used by folk performers — Shamanth blended modern instruments and included sounds from drums and taiko, a Japanese percussion instrument too.

Although the song’s composition took only four hours (project done in two days), the team couldn’t finalise a singer whose voice suited the folk style rendition. Shamanth was not keen but those who heard him sing, felt his rustic voice suited the best.

In his 14 years with the music industry, he has composed for Tamil movies including Revelations, Andhadhi and Sethum Ayiram Pon and Unardhal (worked in the music department) and Nirvana Inn (Hindi). In Telugu, he was a sound engineer for C/o Kancharapalem and Spyder. His new release as a composer is yet-to-be-released children’s film Selfie Mummy Google Daddy (Kannada).

321,2020/10/13,Burning of hospital waste leaves residents worried,"Municipality seeks explanation from Thripunithura taluk hospital

Hospital waste is being burnt on Thripunithura taluk hospital premises, despite a waste collection facility being in place, according to residents in the area and municipality officials.

“While the hospital has been burning waste within its compound for a few years now, irresponsible disposal of waste in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic is worrying,” said Karthik G. Menon, a resident who lives about 50 m away from the hospital. Last week, Karthik shared a video on Facebook that shows hospital waste being burnt in a pile within the hospital compound. “Masks, gloves, IV kits, sponges and syringes are all just burnt. The stench from it has been a nuisance to residents here,” he said.

“The hospital authorities have been warned but repeated entreaties have fallen on deaf ears,” said Radhika Varma, councillor representing ward 38, the area where the hospital lies. “Even masks are being burnt and residents in the area have been complaining repeatedly. The hospital Superintendent has not been monitoring the issue strictly. The municipality chairperson has sent the hospital a letter asking for an explanation,” she said.

The hospital is registered with the Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-Friendly (IMAGE) biomedical waste collection system, said Chandrika Devi, Thripunithura municipality chairperson. “The hospital is burning the waste that is meant to be collected and disposed of safely. The municipality has warned them a few times and has recently sent them a notice asking the hospital to explain their stance,” she said.

“Five years ago, the municipality set up a kiosk for composting of biodegradable waste at the hospital. Hospital staff was even trained to use it. But the kiosk remains abandoned now,” Ms. Chandrika said.

However, hospital Superintendent Dr. Catherine Peter answered in the negative when asked if they were burning waste and refused to respond further.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/burning-of-hospital-waste-leaves-residents-worried/article32846184.ece
322,2020/10/13,MGU’s practical exam schedule leaves students worried,"It is difficult to maintain physical distance inside laboratories, say teachers

The decision by Mahatma Gandhi University to conduct the fourth semester undergraduate practical exams from Wednesday onwards has left a section of the students and teachers worried.

With the pandemic crisis escalating, they suggest that a change in the schedule would help avert the possibilities of getting exposed to the health crisis. The government had already declared that the pandemic curve would worsen in the October-November period. The practical exams were being scheduled till November 14, they said.

Teachers said that it would be difficult to adhere to physical-distancing rules inside laboratories. “We can ensure adequate distancing between candidates inside halls where theory exams are held. But it will not be possible inside labs considering space and other constraints,” they said. The labs will have to be sanitised before the start of practical exams as per the standard operating procedure prescribed by the health authorities. The process will have to be repeated after each session to avoid any potential risks of infection.

Managements clueless

Students residing in other districts pointed out that they would have to travel all the way to their colleges to attend the practical examinations. “We are not sure whether the college authorities will provide us with hostel accommodation. Hostels and canteen facilities had been closed after the nationwide locked down from March-end onwards,” they said.

Many students would have to stay back as they have to appear for the practical for subsidiary papers too. College managements remain clueless on how to open up hostels even as the number of positive cases was going up across the State.

‘No other option’

323,2020/10/13,Pandemic crisis adds to exam woes of CA students,"Candidates from containment zones not allowed to write examinations

The worsening pandemic crisis has increased the anxiety of candidates appearing for the chartered accountancy examinations starting November 1.

With the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) deciding to stick to the declared schedule for exams concluding on November 18, aspirants remain worried about whether the health crisis will affect their chances of appearing for the exam. Some of the provisions in the standard operating procedures to be implemented at exam centres have also added to their woes.

Candidates having temperature above the limit prescribed by the health authorities will not be permitted to the enter the exam centre. Aspirants recalled that separate rooms had been provided for candidates who had appeared for national and State-level entrance exams held recently. “We may lose the chance to write the exam in such a scenario. The next chance will come only in May next year,” they said. The guideline will be applicable for students residing in containment zones too.

A section of the students pointed out that candidates who opted for exam centres in Bihar would enjoy the advantage of additional days for exam preparation as the ICAI had postponed the exams scheduled on November 2, 3, 6 and 7 to November 19, 21, 23 and 25 in view of the Assembly election.

Babu Abraham Kallivayalil, member of the ICAI’s central council, said that students having above normal temperature would be permitted to appear for the exam if they submitted a COVID-19 negative certificate issued the day before the exam. “They will be seated separately,” he said.

On candidates residing in containment zones, Mr. Babu Abraham said that the government rules stated that they were not permitted to come out of containment zones. The ICAI had increased the number of exam centres across the country in view of the additional precautionary measures taken amidst the pandemic. There would be different zones (accommodating only 100 candidates) within an exam centre, he said.

Mr. Abraham pointed out that the postponement of the schedule in Bihar was taken in view of the Assembly election. “We had postponed exams on previous occasions too in view of local situations like a natural calamity or an emergency,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pandemic-crisis-adds-to-exam-woes-of-ca-students/article32844829.ece
324,2020/10/13,Police warn job aspirants against falling prey to online fraud,"21 cases reported in Ernakulam Rural so far this year

A young IT professional lured by the prospects of making a lucrative career in the United States has ended up losing over ₹11 lakh after being ensnared in an online job fraud.

It started with the youngster striking a friendship over Facebook with someone claiming to be a U.S. woman military officer posted in Iraq. As days went by, the imposter dangled the carrot of setting up an IT business in the U.S. along with requests for financial help for her sick son’s impending surgery.

The victim fell for it and transferred ₹11.50 lakh in over 20-odd transactions to around 14 different bank branches across the country. Doubts over why a U.S. citizen stationed in Iraq wanted deposits in Indian banks were swept aside by the reasoning that such transfers would raise suspicions in the U.S. and that her friends here would help her.

This was among the 21 online job fraud cases reported in Ernakulam Rural so far this year. District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik has warned job aspirants from falling for such online job frauds. The numbers, though, could be misleading since many victims either choose not to report cases or camouflage job frauds as online cheating, said sources.

Data entry has emerged as the preferred job fraud whereby targets are required to submit work for predetermined rates. Their identity documents and even signatures are collected as part of the deal. “Once the works are submitted, they are rejected on one pretext or the other and are then threatened with legal repercussions, using job agreements fabricated using victims’ signatures unless damages are paid. Scared, many of them pay and the incidents go unreported,” said sources.

Fabricating portals of foreign healthcare institutions with vacancies is another common ploy. The portals feature original contact numbers to convince potential victims likely to verify vacancies but the payments made go to accounts of fraudsters. A similar ploy of fabricated portals is used for visa frauds and vacancies published in genuine job portals. This remains the preferred route for cheating, using original vacancies in automobile companies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/police-warn-job-aspirants-against-falling-prey-to-online-fraud/article32839022.ece
325,2020/10/13,Eco-sensitive zone of Thattekad Bird Sanctuary notified,"Parts of Kuttampuzha, Keerampara villages to fall within zone

An extent of one kilometre around the boundary of Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary has been notified as its eco-sensitive zone (EZ).

The EZ, according to the draft notification published by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, will cover an area of 28.444 sq.km. Some parts of the Kuttampuzha and Keerampara villages will fall within the EZ of the sanctuary, according to the notification.

An area of 25.16 sq. km, lying on the northern bank of River Periyar, was declared as the bird sanctuary by the Government of Kerala in 1983, considering its ecological, faunal, floral, natural and zoological significance. The Thattekkad sanctuary is also the first bird sanctuary in Kerala and is considered a haven for nature lovers and birdwatchers with a wide variety of flora and fauna. The sanctuary is also considered as one of the richest bird sanctuaries of the State, with the presence of 284 bird species recorded from there.

The area was previously part of the Kuttampuzha section of Kuttampuzha Forest Range under Malayattoor Forest Division. Currently, it is under the administrative jurisdiction of Idukki Wildlife Division.

Rare bird species such as three-toed forest Kingfisher, Ceylon frogmouth, crimson-throated Barbet, bee-eater, sunbird, and Malabar grey hornbill are seen in the sanctuary.

Thattekkad is on the foothills of the Western Ghats and is part of a large ecological unit comprising Malayattoor, Sholayar, Parambikulam hill ranges on the one side and Munnar, Eravikulam and Chinnar on the other side, which support diverse vegetation types from evergreen to scrub forests that enables birds in their seasonal migration, according to the notification.

The draft notification, which was published on September, 29, will be taken up for consideration after a period of 60 days. The public may send in comments and suggestions on the draft proposals within 60 days of the publication to the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Indira Paryavaran Bhawan, Jorbagh Road, Aliganj, New Delhi-110 003, or to the e-mail address esz-mef@nic.in.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/k0bhvp/article32840201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12KITHATTEKKAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/eco-sensitive-zone-of-thattekad-bird-sanctuary-notified/article32839021.ece
326,2020/10/13,ANERT plans electric vehicle charging stations every 50 km,"Entire network of stations to be switched to solar power within a year

The Agency for New and Renewable Energy Research and Technology (ANERT) has plans to equip Kerala with an electric vehicle charging station every 50 km or 25 stations in each district and to switch the entire network of stations within a year to solar power as the State’s e-mobility projects move forward.

The agency had firmed up plans to rope in private investors to set up charging stations along the State’s road network, with priority being given to national highways and M.C. Road, said ANERT sources on Monday.

They said private persons with a suitable piece of land for a charging station could come forward, and ANERT would help provide the equipment and technical backup. In other cases, if an investor is willing to put in money for setting up a charging station, ANERT will help find a suitable location for the station.

Agency sources said electric vehicles were expected to catch up in a big way within a couple of years and charging stations would be good investments as more people shifted from conventional to electric vehicles. ANERT has now completed 135 site surveys across the State for setting up charging stations.

ANERT with support from Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), an agency under the Union Ministry of Power, commissioned an electric vehicle charging station in Kochi on Sunday, where cars are now being allowed to recharge free of cost for three months. The facility will be officially inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in November.

ANERT’s initial plan is to set up a charging station in each district, with Thiruvananthapuram having three stations as part of the e-mobility programme in which government departments will not be allowed to hire non-electric vehicles on long-term rent from next April.

By the end of March, the agency expects to supply 300 vehicles to various government departments, including local bodies, and to raise the number of e-vehicle supply to a thousand by next year. One of the key reasons for people’s reluctance to go in for electric vehicles was the lack of sufficient charging stations, said an ANERT official.

ANERT will buy the electric vehicles through EESL and enter into a contract with the respective government department, which needs vehicles on rent. The rentals rates are different based on the vehicle models, but ANERT bears the cost of insurance and maintenance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/anert-plans-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-every-50-km/article32838994.ece

328,2020/10/13,Fort Kochi police face public ire,"Alleged assault on youngsters near Customs Jetty

Discontent is brewing against the Fort Kochi police for the alleged assault on a group of youngsters in a ground near Customs Jetty on Sunday evening.

Five youngsters were injured in the alleged assault, and they are undergoing treatment at two different hospitals.

While the victims alleged that they were mercilessly beaten up by a five-member police team for having assembled for playing cricket, the police termed it an unlawful assembly and said that the youths might have sustained injuries while attempting to flee.

“The youngsters had assembled in violation of Section 144 and could have been charged accordingly but were instead brutally assaulted using wooden planks,” alleged Aneesh Mattancherry, a social activist who warned of further protests unless action was taken against the guilty.

Shameer K.S., a local resident whose younger brother was injured in the incident, said the youngsters had no history of anti-social activities, and that the police had beaten them up with little warning. He added that one of them was seriously injured above his eye and accused Sunil Kumar, a civil police officer, of being particularly nasty.

Fort Kochi Station House Officer G.B. Manuraj said the place was a hub of anti-social elements. He added that the youngsters had sustained injuries while trying to flee the police, though two cops armed with bamboo canes had charged them beneath their knees while they were on the run. “The seriously injured person had admitted in the hospital to have suffered injuries on jumping off a high wall in his attempt to flee. They also damaged the police vehicle,” said Mr. Manuraj, who also defended Sunil Kumar as a no-nonsense cop attached to the special operations group who, despite being a local resident, acted impartially against fellow residents engaged in drug deals and was hence disliked.

The police have registered two separate cases against those who assembled at the ground and then laid siege to the station later, invoking charges of unlawful assembly, rioting, violation of 144, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, and Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/fort-kochi-police-face-public-ire/article32838969.ece
329,2020/10/13,High drama as accused escapes police custody,"The 19-year-old had been arrested over complaints of nuisance

High drama prevailed at Kalamassery after an accused escaped police custody, mounted a two-storey building in the neighbourhood and threatened to jump in the face of attempts by the police to capture him.

The 19-year-old from Alappuzha was picked up by the Kalamassery police from a hostel at Edappally over complaints of nuisance.

Though he was charged with bailable offences here, it soon emerged that he was absconding in a non-bailable case charged under IPC 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) by the Vallikunnam police in Alappuzha.

“As we interrogated him about that case, he just took off and climbed up a building in the neighbourhood,” said the police. Soon, fire force teams from Gandhinagar and Eloor stations rushed to the spot.

Fortunately, a friend rushed to the scene and talked him into coming down, and the police took him away, fire force sources said.

331,2020/10/13,Activities at Thoppumpady harbour come to a standstill,"Dispute continues over arrival of fishers from Tamil Nadu

The dispute over the arrival of gillnet boats with fishers from Tamil Nadu on board brought activities at the Thoppumpady fishing harbour to a standstill on Monday, as purse seine boat workers called off all fishing activities, with harbour workers refusing to handle their catch.

Though a meeting was convened by District Collector S. Suhas on Sunday, it failed to end the impasse, and talks on Monday did not see any breakthrough, said M. Majeed of Harbour Coordination Committee.

Thoppumpady is Kerala’s biggest fishing harbour, and it was reopened after the annual trawling ban only in the second week of August owing to the lockdown. Bad weather warnings had further disrupted fishing operations from the harbour where thousands of vessels — 250 gillnet boats, 400 long liners, 300 trawlers, and 70 purse seine boats — operate.

The bone of contention is that fishers from other States are banned from entering Kerala harbours as per the COVID-19 protocol issued by the State government. The boats can be fined, and the Fisheries Department is considering imposing fine on four boats.

A section of harbour workers feels that they should not be punished so harshly. But purse seine boat workers, who had initially objected to the arrival of gillnet boats and prevented the catch on these boats from being sold at Thoppumpady harbour, are now facing opposition from harbour workers.

There are around 5,000 workers who depend on the harbour directly for their livelihood. The long shutdown and loss of fishing days have placed fishers in a financially hard situation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/activities-at-thoppumpady-harbour-come-to-a-standstill/article32838956.ece
332,2020/10/13,Six-member gang arrested near Perumbavoor,"They were allegedly plotting an attack

The Kuruppampady police on Monday arrested a six-member gang who were lying low ahead of an alleged attack.

The arrested are Joji, 20, of Kannanchery, Amal, 27, of Kochangady, Basil, 25, of Aruvappara, Srikanth, 31, of Nedungapra, Nibin, 25, of Vengoor, and Adarsh, 21, of Vengoor. The accused had previous cases for murder, attempt to murder, bomb attacks, and charges under the Arms Act levelled against them.

The gang was arrested with weapons from a deserted building in a forest region near Perumbavoor, based on a tip-off received by District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Kathik. They were allegedly plotting a fresh attack.

Joji has nine cases against him and was banned from entering the Ernakulam Rural police limits after being booked under the Arms Act. Amal has 25 cases, Basil seven cases, and the rest have two cases each against them.

A team led by Perumbavoor Deputy Superintendent of Police K. Bijumon, Inspector K.R. Manoj, Sub Inspectors Rajan and Nisar, and Assistant Sub Inspector Ismail made the arrest.

18 arrested

A special team of the Ernakulam Rural police arrested 18 persons in as many cases and seized over 3 kg of ganja in a special drive held on Monday.

The team was formed by District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Kathik to crack down on ganja peddlers.

Three kilograms of ganja were seized from two persons in two different cases. Sanoop, 37, of Edathala was nabbed with 2 kg of ganja from a private lodge at Perumbavoor, while 1 kg of the drug was seized from Pareeth Pilla, 54, of Mudikkal. He had allegedly purchased it from the former.

333,2020/10/13,One more held in Panangad murder case,"The Panangad police made yet another arrest in connection with a series of events that ended up in a gang war of sorts, leading to the death of a youngster last month.

The arrested is Praveen Raj, 33, of Cherthala. He is accused of being part of a gang that smashed and broke into a car and stole two mobile phones at Panangad on September 10.

The incident had triggered a mass brawl that also involved drug dealers and led to the alleged murder of one Fahad Hussain, 19, of Nettoor, at INTUC Junction at Nettoor three days later.

The police had already arrested seven persons in connection with the incident of breaking into the car, while another 19 had been arrested for their involvement in the alleged murder. The accused was allegedly part of a gang that had come to Panangad from Thrissur on the day of the incident. Four more of that gang remain to be arrested.

A team comprising Inspector A. Ananthalal, Sub Inspector Rigin M. Thomas, and Assistant Sub Inspector Jayaprakash made the arrest.

A team led by Deputy Commissioner (Law and Order) G. Poonguzhali and Thrikkakara Assistant Commissioner Jijimon had already arrested 34 persons linked to ganja trade.

Attempt to Murder

The Aluva East police arrested a person on the charge of attempt to murder.

The arrested is Vishal, 30, a resident near Cochin Bank Junction. According to the police, he was hiding at his friend’s house.

Later, the two fell apart, and the friend tried to expel him from his house, following which the accused allegedly attempted to murder him. On Monday, the police received a tip-off that the accused was somewhere near the Aluva General Hospital.

But he fled on seeing the police who successfully chased him down. He has several cases, including attempt to murder, theft, and drug-trafficking against his name at Angamaly, Edathala and Nedumbassery police stations.

334,2020/10/13,Corpn. to write to govt. against WTE plant,"‘The project will place massive financial liability on the civic body’

Despite opposition from LDF councillors, the Kochi Corporation will write to the State government against what the councillors of the ruling front claim is a decision to set up the waste-to-energy (WTE) plant in a manner that could place a massive financial liability upon the civic body.

The company that will now get to handle the WTE project for the corporation will be responsible for transporting waste, said UDF councillor A.B. Sabu. For every tonne of waste to be carried to Brahmapuram, the company could charge a tipping fee of ₹3,550, he said. With the corporation producing around 300 tonnes of waste daily, this could cost the civic administration nearly ₹10.5 lakh a day, he pointed out. “Since the company is already being paid a tipping fee and is, therefore, ensured some profit, there is no profit motive binding the company to produce electricity. They could just dump waste at the site and still be ensured of a profit,” Mr. Sabu said at the council meeting held on Monday.

The agreement that was signed earlier and cancelled by the government in May this year had ensured some profit to the corporation, if waste over 250 tonnes was sent to the plant. But with a Government Order from 2018 making changes to the terms of the agreement on the basis of which WTE plants will be operated, the corporation is no longer ensured of any profit, Mr. Sabu said. It will now write to the government asking for the terms to be reconsidered.

Mayor Soumini Jain said the corporation’s financial liability with the earlier agreement was around ₹30 crore annually. With the changes likely to be made to the new contract, the corporation could have to deal with nearly twice that financial burden yearly, she added.

When Opposition councillors sought to discuss the matter at a steering committee meeting before taking it to the State government, the resolution was passed by voting with the UDF’s majority in the council. LDF Parliamentary Party secretary V.P. Chandran said the same matter of the WTE plant being a financial liability had incidentally been raised by former Mayor Tony Chammany at a recent press briefing. “The issue is not being raised in the city’s interest,” he said.

Over the issue of the corporation’s land near the High Court recently being attached, the Opposition staged a protest against the civic body’s inability to protect its assets. The corporation’s new office was being constructed at the site, and with the property being attached, the fate of the new building hangs in the balance, said Opposition leader K.J.

336,2020/10/13,Bengal alters 2017 law to allow basic procedures in clinics,"Govt had brought in West Bengal Clinical Establishments Act, which prohibited private practitioners from carrying out even the simplest of procedures

Amid the glut of news related to the pandemic that included capping the price of COVID-19 test at ₹1,500, one key development went largely unnoticed in West Bengal: the government’s decision to allow doctors to perform basic medical procedures at their private clinics.

In early 2017, the government brought in the West Bengal Clinical Establishments Act, which prohibited private practitioners from carrying out even the simplest of procedures - such as conducting ECG or administering a vaccine or stitching up an wound - at their clinics unless the clinic was registered under the Act. Since getting registered and meeting the requirements prescribed under the Act was a cumbersome and an expensive process, most clinics had been reduced to consultation chambers.

This reversal of stand is a major victory for the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, which was formed that year to fight the Act. The forum had gone to court, and while the hearing is still on, the State Government, following a series of dialogues with the forum, has scrapped the clause that barred private clinics from carrying out basic procedures.

Department notification

A notification issued by the Department of Health on October 1 allows 10 procedures to be carried out in consultation clinics. They include primary resuscitation and life-saving procedures; stitching of superficial injuries; removal of stitches, incision and drainage of superficial abscess; ECG; and catheterisation for urinary retention.

“Because of this clause, our clinics were being used only for consultation purposes, depriving care-seekers of routine as well as emergency procedures. This not only hindered clinical services but was also a blow to clinical autonomy. Now that clause stands abolished,” Dr. Koushik Chaki, a founding member of the forum, told The Hindu.

The scrapping of this clause couldn’t have been timelier. So far, from the time the Act came into effect, a private practitioner could only refer a patient to the nearest hospital or diagnostic centre for these simple - but often life-saving - procedures. In the time of the pandemic, visiting a hospital or diagnostic centre to get an ECG or a wound stitched only puts the patient at risk because the chances of one contracting COVID-19 are the highest in a hospital.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/atks1f/article32844277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ECG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/bengal-alters-2017-law-to-allow-basic-procedures-in-clinics/article32844278.ece

338,2020/10/13,Move to repeal National Trust Act draws flak,"Activists fear denial of rights to intellectually challenged persons

The Kerala unit of Parivar, the National Confederation of Parents Organisations (NCPO), is fighting the Centre’s move to repeal the National Trust Act tooth and nail, to uphold the privileges enjoyed by intellectually challenged persons.

“Both our State unit and the 14 district units have already written to the Prime Minister and the Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment in this regard. We are trying to create awareness among parliamentarians about the importance of the National Trust Act. If need be, parents under Parivar will send individual letters to the authorities concerned,” Sukumaran Mangalassery, national vice president of Parivar, said.

The National Trust Act was a millennium gift to the intellectually challenged in 1999 from Maneka Gandhi, then Minister for Social Justice. Under the Act, the National Trust, an autonomous body, was formed for the welfare of people with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and multiple disabilities. The trust is answerable to the Ministry, but with independent powers to implement schemes for the welfare of the intellectually challenged. The schemes include health-care, insurance, and shelter homes.

The Centre’s move to consolidate the various programmes for the differently abled comes as an austerity measure. The plan is to include all disabilities under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act 2016. “A similar move in 2016 was thwarted when the penal provisions for the protection of the intellectually challenged under the National Trust Act were at stake. Now, the whole Act is at stake,” Mr. Sukumaran said.

339,2020/10/13,"Quarry operators, lorry owners stage protest","Agitators flay ‘hostile legal actions’ by Geology Dept.

A coordination committee of quarry operators and tipper lorry owners staged protests at three different locations in Kozhikode district on Monday as part of their State-wide agitation flaying “hostile legal actions” by the Geology Department and the Vigilance squad.

The protesters who held the State government accountable for not resolving genuine issues of entrepreneurs in the sector alleged that they were being victimised in the name of rules. They claimed that the legal actions were meant to torture the lower income groups.

M.K. Babu, a functionary of Small Scale Quarry Owners Association, said the flaws in the existing laws for controlling quarry and allied businesses should be rectified at the earliest, to protect the rights of both labourers and entrepreneurs. He alleged that some rules and regulations were meant to safeguard the interests of big corporates.

The strike was organised in the wake of a recent incident in which a tipper lorry driver from Kozhikode district allegedly attempted suicide after he was heavily fined by the Geology Department for overloading. According to him, the fine amount of ₹50,000 to compound the offence was unthinkable for even large-scale entrepreneurs. It was a Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) squad that tracked the alleged offence during a flash check and reported it to the Geology Department for follow-up action.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/quarry-operators-lorry-owners-stage-protest/article32838936.ece
340,2020/10/13,Divergent views on Mahila Mall put Kozhikode corporatio in a fix,"Reports by IIMK and councillors’ panel are on different tangents

Conflicting reports on ways to improve the functioning of Mahila Mall in the city has put the Kozhikode Corporation in jeopardy.

The first report submitted by management experts from the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode (IIMK), and the latest by a committee comprising corporation councillors under the welfare standing committee are on two different tangents.

Mahila Mall, hailed as Asia’s first mall with an all-woman crew, was opened in November 2018 by Unity Group, a unit under the Kozhikode Corporation Kudumbashree CDS. However, the mall failed to take off completely, reportedly due to lack of facilities and the failure of the management to devise proper marketing strategies.

A group of management experts headed by Deepa Sethi, chairperson of international relations at IIMK, had submitted a report in February 2020 to the Kudumbashree and the District Collector. The report called for a basic change in marketing strategies to lead the mall to success. It recommended loyalty cards to customers, annual fairs and occasions to improve footfall, improvisation of the mall website, and online marketing, besides promotion through social media. The IIMK report also recommended a basic change in the structure of shops as a long-term measure to improve the mall’s appeal.

However, the Kozhikode Corporation constituted a committee to investigate into the matter following protest by entrepreneurs at the mall, as it was not reopened post-lockdown. The committee led by welfare standing committee chairperson Anitha Rajan submitted a report to the Mayor in which the lack of expertise of the management in handling such a huge venture was highlighted. The report recommended the appointment of an expert to guide the management.

Besides, high rent was cited as a reason for the loss faced by entrepreneurs and hence, it was cut down. The “high prices” of products were cited as the reason for the poor footfall and hence, the report recommended inclusion of more products from Kudumbashree units at the mall. The location of the mall, on a one-way road, was also cited as a reason for poor footfall.

“The issues at Mahila Mall are quite simple. But some vested interests were trying to misuse it for political reasons,” Ms. Rajan said.

Meanwhile, Mayor Thottathil Raveendran said the corporation was yet to look into the reports and arrive at a conclusion.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/f491c2/article32838920.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-KI-MAHILA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/divergent-views-on-mahila-mall-put-kozhikode-corporatio-in-a-fix/article32838921.ece
341,2020/10/13,Shortage of labourers hits fishing operations,"Delay alleged in issuing fitness certificates

Though fishing harbours and fish landing centres in the district were reopened on Monday by complying with the COVID-19 protocol, about 30 trawler boats at Beypore harbour could not operate because of shortage of labourers.

Fishermen union leaders said some of the technicalities related to the issuance of fitness certificates to migrant fishers were causing issues to them. “The larger boats, each cost at least ₹25 lakh, have been lying idle at Karuvanthiruthi for over six months. Many of the boats will have to be repainted to prevent rusting. Boat owners are finding it difficult to get labourers and mobilise money for the pending repairing works,” said Karichal Preman, vice president, All Kerala Fishing Boat Owners Association.

He said the process to issue fitness certificates for migrant fishermen should be simplified to help the remaining trawlers resume operations. He said that Health and Fisheries officials should adopt feasible measures to speed up the process.

Boat owners from Beypore harbour said the latest unlock guidelines permitting the reopening of harbours and fish landing centres were only addressing concerns of local fishers. According to them, service of more number of trawler boats will only help fishermen families.

Safety concerns

Meanwhile, Fisheries Department sources said the permissible number of trawler boats from the harbour area had already been granted clearance for operation and the case of remaining ones could be considered only in accordance with the next phase of unlock action plan. The trawlers that resumed operation from Beypore had gone through the same procedures insisted by the district administration to fight COVID-19 spread effectively in the coastal area, they said.

An official attached to the Fisheries Department said the operation of only 50% of the total fishers would be allowed at present at harbours and fish landing centres considering safety aspects.

“Clearance can be given to the remaining segment only by complying with this ratio for their own safety,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/vm4elx/article32840207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvkzbeypore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/shortage-of-labourers-hits-fishing-operations/article32838484.ece

343,2020/10/13,HC issues guidelines for conducting post mortem,"Court asks State to appoint Scientific Officers at govt. medical college hospitals

Passing a series of directions with respect to conduct of post mortems and issue of certificates, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has ruled that doctors should follow Article 621 of the Tamil Nadu Medical Code, by sending the post mortem certificate, as soon as it is over, to the judicial magistrate concerned.

A copy of the certificate should be sent to the head of the department on the same day, failing which departmental proceedings should be initiated against them, the court said, and directed the Health Secretary to issue a circular directing the doctors to strictly follow Article 621 of the Tamil Nadu Medical Code.

The court directed the State government to appoint Scientific Officers at all Government Medical College Hospitals for providing assistance. Biometric attendance for staff should be followed in hospitals. A web-based medico legal examination and post mortem reports system should be followed at all hospitals from January 1, 2021, the court said.

The court was hearing the public interest litigation petition filed by advocate R.M. Arun Swaminathan, who complained of lacuna in the procedures followed in conducting post mortem at government hospitals. There was no transparency and the procedure prescribed under the Tamil Nadu Medical Code was not followed, he said.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and S.S. Sundar took cognisance of the fact that there were several irregularities in the conduct of post mortem, and sometimes even unauthorised people were conducting them. Also, the preparation of the certificate was not in the format prescribed by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).

The court said there was a failure on the part of doctors and forensic experts to send the post mortem certificates immediately to the Judicial Magistrate and to the head of the department.

Besides, these post mortem reports were handwritten and not legible. Unless they were legibly written, it would not be possible for non-medical people to understand the writings of the doctors and forensic experts. The certificates had to be read and understood for conducting investigation and deciding cases, the judges said.

The court said the NHRC format should be followed in issuing post mortem certificates. The post mortems should be videographed whenever requests were made by the families or the friends of the deceased, the court said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-issues-guidelines-for-conducting-post-mortem-madurai/article32846875.ece
344,2020/10/13,‘Release water from Vaigai through Nilaiyur channel for irrigation’,"Madurai

A section of farmers from Tirupparankundram block urged the district administration to release water from the Vaigai through Nilaiyur channel to fill the system tanks for undertaking cultivation during the online grievance meeting held on Tuesday.

The meeting chaired by Collector T.G. Vinay was the first farmers' grievance meeting conducted in the district since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Farmers from the 13 blocks took part in the online meeting.

Sethu, a farmer from Tirupparankundram block, said that the groundwater level in their block was depleting and all the tanks were dry without water. “By releasing water for irrigation, the groundwater level will increase and the farmers can also undertake cultivation,” he said.

There were several irregularities in the distribution of water for irrigation by Public Works Department (PWD) officials, said S. Dharmaraj, a farmer from Karuppayurani.

“The PWD officials are releasing excess water for areas where the requirement is lower. Similarly, they are releasing less water for areas where the requirement is higher,” he added. The Collector said that the issue will be addressed at the earliest.

The PWD officials are releasing excess water when compared to last year, said Rajamanickam, a farmer from Melur block.

Many private establishments were not giving printed receipts to farmers who purchase agricultural commodities, said Kumarasamy, a farmer from Alanganallur block. Joint Director of Agriculture T. Vivekanandan said that the officials will inspect the shops and take immediate action against such private establishments.

Many farmers complained that water for irrigation did not reach tail-end areas.

Ramar, a farmer from Chellampatti block, said that there was a need to establish more number of Direct Procurement Centres (DPC) for paddy in their block as harvest for kuruvai season was under way. The Collector said that the officials will inspect and accordingly introduce more number of DPCs.

Farmers from Vadipatti block alone couldn't participate in the online meeting due to a technical glitch and the Collector asked them to submit their petitions to agricultural department officials.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/wpj3lp/article32846832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA14FARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/release-water-from-vaigai-through-nilaiyur-channel-for-irrigation/article32846833.ece

The sexagenarian said four generations of labourers were residing in these estates for the past 90 years. Around 700 family cards had been issued by Civil Supplies department to the people in these region and presently 2,000 labourers were working in these plantations

More than 100 children of these labourers were studying in schools, colleges and other institutions across Tirunelveli. About 10 years ago, the BSNL brought 2G cellular network connection to the region and till date that was the only connection. However, network connectivity had become an issue now.

The children are unable to attend online classes, apply for examinations or other courses, download documents or study materials. The issue had to be addressed and there was a need to upgrade the network to 4G connectivity, the petitioner said and sought a direction to the State and the BSNL to upgrade the connectivity.

The State has preferred an appeal before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court against the acquittal of a youth by Dindigul Mahila Court in the rape and murder case of a minor, daughter of a hairstylist. The acquittal had sparked outrage and hairstylists across the State staged protests, demanding justice.

State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan on Tuesday made a mention in this regard before a Division Bench of Justices K. Kalyanasundaram and T. Krishnavalli. The judges ordered notice to the youth, who was accused of rape and murder.

The State, in the appeal, said the trial court had failed to consider key evidence in the case. It ought to have seen the presence of the accused in the house of the deceased at the time of occurrence and his conduct after coming out of the house, as stated by an eye witness.

The trial court also failed to consider the evidence of the DNA test conducted from the blood-stained inner wear of the accused that matched with the DNA of the girl’s parents. This, coupled with the evidence, clearly established the guilt of the accused, the State said, and sought setting aside of the acquittal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/state-appeals-against-trial-court-order-in-dindigul-case-madurai-high-court/article32846527.ece

350,2020/10/13,Jawan’s body cremated,"Villagers stage road roko

Body of the Indian Army jawan, who allegedly committed suicide who had been deployed in Jammu and Kashmir, was cremated in his native place of Aayaalpatti on Tuesday.

The family of jawan D. Mullairaj, 28, of Aayaalpatti in Tenkasi district, who was working in Baramullah district of Jammu and Kashmir, received information on October 11 over phone that Mullairaj passed away. Since the person who informed the family about the untimely demise of Mullairaj could not be contacted again to understand the reason for his death, the family was shocked. No senior army official contacted the family to formally inform them about the death of Mullairaj.

After Mullairaj’s mother Azhagathal submitted a petition to Collector G.K. Arun Sundar Thayalan on Monday, he contacted the higher-ups in the Ministry of Defence to know the reason behind the death of the soldier and took steps to bring the body back to his native place.

MDMK general secretary Vaiko sent a letter to Minister for Defence Rajnath Singh seeking probe into the “mysterious death” of the jawan and immediate steps to send the body quickly.

A team of army personnel brought the body to Aayalpatti on Tuesday. However, the villagers, who accused the army officials for not properly informing the family about the death, staged a road roko. Led by MDMK Tirunelveli rural district secretary T.M. Rajendran, they said the due compensation should be given to the family.

Even though Revenue Divisional Officer Murugaselvi, DSP, Sankarankovil, Balasundaram, and tahsildar Thirumalaiselvi held talks with them, they refused to give up their agitation. When the army officials, in the presence of police and revenue officials, held talks with the protesters, they told the family that Mullairaj had committed suicide. They promised the family that assistance would be given early.

The jawan’s body was later cremated.

Those in distress or having suicidal tendencies could seek help and counselling by calling State’s health helpline 104 or Chennai-based Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/jawan/article32846013.ece

“Besides arresting seven accused in this case, we’ve provided protection to the house of Paulraj, the victim,” said S. Jayakumar, Superintendent of Police, who visited the Kayathar police station and the victim’s house on Tuesday after the case was registered on Monday based on a complaint from Mr. Paulraj.

When Mr. Paulraj took his sheep and goats for grazing to Thirumangalakurichikulam tank on October 8, S. Sivasangu, an intermediate caste Hindu shepherd from the same village, also took his sheep and goats inside the water body for grazing. When a lamb of Mr. Paulraj accidentally entered the herd of Mr. Sivasangu, the former entered the herd of Mr. Sivasangu in a bid to take the lamb back to his herd. Agitated over this, Mr. Sivasangu, after verbally abusing Mr. Paulraj by allegedly referring to his caste, tried to attack him with a club. As Mr. Paulraj resisted it, Mr. Sivasangu went to the village and mobilized his relatives S. Periyamari, S. Veeraiya, P. Mahendran, S. Maharajan, S. Sangilipandi and S. Udaiyammal, who assaulted Mr. Paulraj and reportedly threatened him of dire consequences.

The victim alleged that they forced him to fall at the feet of Mr. Sivasangu multiple times as a mark of tendering apology to him even as Mahendran and Maharajan were allegedly recording it with their mobile phones. After they posted this video on social media, Mr. Paulraj submitted a complaint with Mr. Jayakumar seeking action against all the accused.

As the complaint was referred to the Kayathar police station, a case was registered against Sivasangu and others on Monday under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 294(b) (uttering obscenities in public), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506(ii) (criminal intimidation) of The Indian Penal Code, read with sections 3(i)(r), 3(i)(s) and 3(2)(v)a of The SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, read with 66 of IT Act.

Subsequently, the police arrested Mr. Sivasangu and others on Tuesday while police protection, led by a Sub-Inspector of Police, has been given to the house of Mr. Paulraj.

“The police will give the victim’s family the much-needed protection till the tense situation prevailing in the village subsides completely,” said Mr. Jayakumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/assault/article32845270.ece

The police have arrested a person who set eight bikes on fire due to prior enmity in which a mechanic got charred to death on Monday night.

They said N. Maria Antony Dinesh Mendis, 46, who was living in a gated community with 27 houses near Cleopatra Theatre on South Cotton Road, was forced to leave the place two months ago by other tenants as he was troubling others, especially women everyday under the influence of alcohol. Agitated over this, Dinesh Mendis, who suspected that two-wheeler mechanic N. Annamalai, 42, one of the residents there, was the reason behind his leaving the place, came to the gated community on Monday night in an inebriated condition.

As Dinesh picked up quarrel with Annamalai, other tenants managed to flush him out of the campus. However, Dinesh, who returned to the spot after midnight., torched the bikes including two-wheelers parked adjacent to the workshop of Annamalai in which eight vehicles were destroyed completely.

When fire from the bikes spread to the house of Annamalai, which is situated next to his workshop, Annamalai saved his wife Ganga and younger son Nikhil, 6, first by swiftly evacuating them to safety from the first floor of the house where they were sleeping. As he tried to save his eldest son Nithin, 8, both the father and the son swooned inside the room due to smoke and sustained burns.

While Annamalai died on the spot, Nithin has been admitted to the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital with serious injuries.

Firefighters led by Thoothukudi Fire Station Officer M. Shankar, doused the flame after an hour-long operation that saved other tenants inside the campus. Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar and Deputy Superintendent of Police, Thoothukudi, Ganesh, visited the spot.

353,2020/10/13,"Unable to pay high rent for bus depot in Kariyapatti, TNSTC looks for government land","Due to the COVID-19 situation, the administration is finding it difficult to pay the annual rent of ₹3 lakh, officials said

Even as a section of officials of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) have expressed fear that ithe Kariyapatti depot is facing the threat of closure, senior officials clarified that efforts were being taken to find government land for a permanent depot.

An official said that the depot was set up on a private land in 2009 and over the years, the rent has increased to ₹25,000 a month. The depot has only a maintenance shed and a rented building for the workers’ retiring room, and lacks other facilities.

The Kariyapatti depot has 19 buses – one muffosil bus operated to Tiruchi and Aruppukottai and 16 town buses catering to Madurai, and villages in Kariaypatti, Narikudi and Tiruchuli blocks. Two are spare buses.

“Under the COVID-19 pandemic conditions, the administration is finding it difficult to pay a rent of ₹3 lakh annually. We have been searching for a plot of government poromboke land for a very long time, but have not succeeded so far,” an official said.

The only way to cut down on the rent is to find government land or to close down the depot. “In the event of its closure, the buses will be sent back to Aruppukottai and Virudhunagar depots that are 20 km and 29 km away respectively. This will result in additional fuel expenses and will lead to reduced services to rural areas,” an official said.

However, a senior official said that there was no proposal to close the depot down but only to shift it to its own land so that additional facilities could be created.

The officials have zeroed in on a Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department plot of land in the vicinity for the depot. “We have discussed with Revenue officials to buy the land for the depot. Even if it is for rent, we will get it for cheaper rate and could have better facilities,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/unable-to-pay-high-rent-for-bus-depot-in-kariyapatti-tnstc-looks-for-government-land/article32843750.ece
354,2020/10/13,Railway reservation centre closed down in Tallakulam,"The facility, catering to passengers from northern parts of Madurai city, had functioned for over 20 years

A railway passenger reservation system (PRS) centre located at Tallakulam that has been serving the people from northern parts of Madurai city for nearly 23 years was closed down on Tuesday.

A public notice has been put up outside the gate of the PRS centre that was functioning on the Postal Department premises. The notice states that the centre has been shifted to the western entry of Madurai Railway junction.

Railway passengers who were regularly visiting the centre to booking their reservation for train journey had to return disappointed.

“I have been coming here for the last 15 years to book tickets,” said S. Rathinam (89), a retired Tahsildar. A resident of Anna Nagar, Mr. Rathinam said that he found it convenient as the centre was close to his home. “I am a frequent traveller and getting tickets at Tallakulam was a good option,” he said. The elderly man returned home disappointed without booking tickets.

Divisional secretary of Dakshin Railway Employees Union, R. Sankaranarayanan said that the PRS was serving the people since 1997. It was helpful for several educational institutions and government offices, he said. “Students who would get concession for their educational tours would come here to book their tickets,” he added.

Besides, officials of various departments, including the police personnel who would use travel warrants to book tickets also found it easier to come here to book tickets. “We condemn this sudden closure without any prior announcement,” he said.

“This is a policy decision taken way back in 2014. Since, then we have been asking the Department of Posts to take over this PRS, like it has done in other towns. But since this has not evoked any positive response, we had to close if after a recent Railway Board circular to close down all the PRS centres functioning outside railway premises,” he added.

355,2020/10/13,SIP inflows drop for sixth month in September,"‘Mutual fund investors prefer liquidity’

Investments in mutual funds via SIPs dropped for the sixth consecutive month to ₹7,788 crore in September, in a challenging economic environment.

The trend is expected to reverse only gradually after investors gain confidence once their own incomes stabilise, said Primeinvestor.in co-founder Vidya Bala.

However, the industry added 7.37 lakh folios last month compared with 4.5 lakh in August, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India showed.

Funds via SIPs last month compare with the ₹7,791 crore garnered in August. Investments in September 2020 hit the lowest since September 2018, when fund collection through the route stood at ₹7,727 crore. “Investments via SIPs have dropped because investors want to maintain some liquidity at their end at present as the situation is uncertain when it comes to their jobs and businesses,” said Harshad Chetanwala of MywealthGrowth.com.

Ms. Bala said SIP inflows were lacklustre as many retail investors stopped SIPs in the lockdown.

356,2020/10/13,Recalibrate response to give direct relief and spending support: IMF to India,"The economy is expected to bounce back to 8.8 % next fiscal year (growth), an upward revision of the June numbers.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected the Indian economy to grow by -10.3% ( a contraction) in the current fiscal year – a 5.8 percentage point downward revision of its June forecast. The economy is expected to bounce back to 8.8 % next fiscal year (growth), an upward revision of the June numbers.

India could do more on the fiscal side to provide support to households and firms that have been affected by the shutdowns, IMF economist Mahlar Nabar said, responding to a question from The Hindu at a virtual press briefing on whether the government had responded sufficiently to the pandemic and what more was needed to help the economy recover.

Mr. Nabar suggested that the government “tilt the composition of the fiscal support towards more of the direct spending and tax relief measures” and to rely “slightly less on the liquidity support measures” and “credit guarantees which are clearly important to support the provision of credit in the economy.”

He said, “But if you look at the approach that was taken, there was more of an emphasis on that type of measure. We think that there is room to recalibrate and to provide more direct relief and spending support which could have a first order impact on preventing even worse outcomes. On the monetary policy side the RBI had come in very aggressively early on. It’s paused recently with its interest rate cuts. Looking through this … spike in inflation that they’ve [India] had recently. “But we believe there’s more the RBI can do too.”

There was room to cut if needed and that the IMF thought this should be done once the inflation spike was more under control, he stated.

These fiscal and monetary side policies would, together, put India on a path to recovery going forward, he noted.

“There’s also been some efforts recently on the structural side to improve medium-term growth prospects,” he said, citing progress on labour reform and farm bills.

“We think that this will advance the structural reform agenda in an important way, remove supply side constraints in the agricultural sector and in the labour market. [ It will ] also allow for a better matching of workers with firms, provide firms with a little more flexibility in terms of hiring options but at the same time also provide more social security and safety net options for workers as well,” he observed.

With these structural elements in place as well to reinforce the cyclical support the Indian economy would be well placed to “start recovering from this horrible crisis,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/w1dtna/article32846785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMF,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/recalibrate-response-to-give-direct-relief-and-spending-support-imf-to-india/article32846787.ece

The Centre on Tuesday permitted 20 States to raise ₹68,825 crore through open market borrowings to bridge the GST revenue shortfall.

The decision came a day after the GST Council meeting failed to reach a consensus on the stalemate over the Centre’s proposal of States borrowing against future GST collections to make up for the shortfall.

The projected total compensation shortfall in the current fiscal stands at ₹2.35 lakh crore.

The Centre had in August given two options to the States — to borrow either ₹97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or ₹ 2.35 lakh crore from the market. It had also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.

The Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, has granted permission to 20 States to raise an additional amount of ₹68,825 crore through open market borrowings, an official statement said on Tuesday.

“Additional borrowing permission has been granted at the rate of 0.50% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) to those States who have opted for Option- 1 out of the two options suggested by the Ministry of Finance to meet the shortfall arising out of GST implementation,” it said.

358,2020/10/13,"India’s economy to contract by 10.3%, says International Monetary Fund","World Output by 4.4% in 2020, it says

With the country and world reeling under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Indian economy is expected to grow at -10.3 % ( i.e., a contraction) in 2020 as per the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Global growth is projected to be -4.4% ( i.e., a contraction in output of 4.4%) for this year , the IMF said with the release of its World Economic Outlook October 2020 report titled, “A Long and Difficult Ascent”.

The 2020 projection for India is a downgrade of -5.8 percentage points from the IMF’s June projection for the country. India is expected to rebound in 2021 with 8.8 percent growth – an upgrade of 2.8 percentage points relative to the June update.

“Revisions to the forecast are particularly large for India, where GDP contracted much more severely than expected in the second quarter,” the report said. Consumer prices in India are expected to grow at 4.9% this year and 3.7% in 2021. The current account balance is projected to grow by 0.3% this year and -0.9% (i.e., a contraction) next year.

For the world as a whole, the 2020 growth projection has been revised upwards by 0.8 percentage points relative to June– a result of a less dire second quarter and signs of a stronger recovery in the third quarter, partly offset by downgrades in certain developing countries and emerging economies (except China).

The recovery in 2021 is projected to be at 5.2% - lower than the June 2020 projections. After 2021, global growth is expected to ease off at 3.5% in the medium term. Except for China, where output this year is expected to exceed 2019 levels, advanced, developing and emerging market economies are expected to see lower output even next year, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said in a note that illustrated the uneven recovery across country groups.

The U.S. economy is expected to grow by -4.3 % this year (i.e., contract) and grow by 3.1% next year. The corresponding numbers for the Euro Area are -8.3% and 5.2%. For China they are 1.9% and 8.2% respectively.

“The crisis is however far from over,” Ms Gopinath said, warning that the labour market has become more polarized, with low-income workers, women and youth being hit harder.

The world will not catch up fully to its pre-pandemic 2020-25 projected growth trajectory the report said, reversing progress made since the 1990s in reducing poverty and increasing inequality and causing a “severe setback” to projected improvements in living-standards across all groups of countries.

The Fund projects that close to 90 million people could fall below the $ 1.90/day extreme poverty threshold (the World Bank last week projected that there could be up to 150 million additional extreme poor in 2020, 2021).

Along with subdued growth for the medium term, the stock of sovereign debt is expected to increase. The projections are based on the assumption that social distancing continues into 2021 fading as vaccine coverage expands and therapies improve. By the end of 2022 local transmission is expected to be low in the forecasting model. However, these projections come with “unusually large” uncertainties.

Fund: More action required

Global fiscal support totaling some $12 trillion and measures such as rate cuts, asset purchases and liquidity injections by central banks protected lives and livelihoods and “prevented a financial catastrophe” Ms Gopinath said.

Also read | U.S. economy shrank at record-breaking 33% rate last quarter

“There is still much that needs to be done to ensure a sustained recovery,” she said. First, is a need for greater international collaboration on tests, treatments and vaccines. If these are made available faster than accounted for in the IMF mode’s baseline scenario, it could mean an increase in global cumulative income by $ 9 trillion by the end of 2025.

Second, policies should “aggressively” seek to limit persistent economic damage. Governments should support incomes, Ms. Gopinath said, by well targeted cash transfers, wage subsidies and unemployment insurance. For firms that are viable but vulnerable, Ms Gopinath recommended support such as tax deferrals, debt servicing moratoria, equity-like injections.

Third, policies should aid workers’ transition to growing sectors (e.g. e-commerce) and away from sectors like travel which are likely to shrink. Other measures include support to governments via institutional grants, concession financing and debt relief “in some cases” so these governments can prioritize critical spending for health and transfers to the poor.

Along with the necessary easing of monetary policy across the world, Ms. Gopinath said, measures to prevent the buildup of financial risks over the medium should be pursued and “central bank independence should be safeguarded at all costs.”

“The challenges are daunting. But there are reasons to be hopeful,” Ms Gopinath said, citing policy measures and the use of digital technology to get assistance to citizens as examples.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/h2ocp0/article32844626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMF,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-economy-to-contract-by-103-says-international-monetary-fund/article32844627.ece
359,2020/10/13,Work-from-home spurs Epson India printer sales,"E-learning also aiding demand: Kumar

Printer maker Epson India has reported a surge in sales during the second quarter of FY21, triggered by high demand for its EcoTank printers from work-from-home (WFH) and e-learning consumers, said a senior official.

“After witnessing a decline in the first quarter sales due to COVID-19 and stoppage of billing from March 15, we are seeing fast recovery,” said Siva Kumar, senior general manager, inkjet printers, Epson India said in an interview.

“The demand is coming from WFH consumers and e-learning segments,” he said.

“In the April to June quarter, we sold 53% of last year’s volume, while it rose to almost 90% in the second quarter. The recovery in the second half will be greater than last year due to continued demand and stabilisation of supply chain,” he said.

According to him, home consumers preferred high-capacity ink-tank inkjet printers (now known as EcoTank printers) due to high yields and low cost. Besides, parents purchased printers to reduce their children’s on-screen time on monitors. The entry pricerate of a multi-function inkjet printer is ₹10,000. A monochrome print costs seven paise per page against 18 paise for a colour page.

He said even government offices had started eyeing inkjet printers since July as they found it difficult to get refills for ink cartridges during the lockdown period and to reduce emissions.

The overall market size for inkjet printers in India for FY19 stood at 1.75 million, of which the share of home and office segments was 40% and 60% respectively.

Epson India led the inkjet printers with a market share of 46.07%, he said. It expects to post double-digit growth.

360,2020/10/13,Vodafone Idea ropes in IBM for ‘big data’ platform,"IBM is leading the end-to-end implementation and management of the ‘big data’ platform.

Telecom operator Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) on Tuesday said it has selected IBM for deployment and management of its ‘big data’ platform.

The move translates into key business and technology benefits such as “significant cost reduction” and streamlining operational complexity, as Vodafone Idea chases new revenue streams and opportunities backed by a future-ready network to leverage the transformational power of 5G going forward, a joint release said.

“The power of data will help transform our cloud and Artificial Intelligence journey in the future,” VIL Chief Technology Officer Vishant Vora said.

As VIL’s strategic technology partner, IBM is leading the end-to-end implementation and management of the ‘big data’ platform.

IBM is responsible for program management, consulting, system integration, infrastructure services, application operations and maintenance support. Apart from this, IBM is helping in enhancing network security, the release said.

“The result of this collaboration is a modernised and future-ready data platform which is helping Vodafone Idea get daily actionable insights, with its strategic and operational level decisions very effectively,” Sandip Patel, Managing Director, IBM India/South Asia told reporters.

IBM has been a strategic IT partner to Vodafone Idea for over a decade.

The implementation builds on IBM’s existing work to advance VIL’s hybrid cloud transformation using open technologies. This includes a pact earlier this year to deliver its Open Universal Cloud with IBM and Red Hat to accelerate network and IT modernisation.

With the IT and network integration, VIL has a need for large-scale data transformation with a focus on architecture modernisation, open-source adoption and using predictive analytics for data modernisation.

“By partnering on this implementation, IBM is helping VIL transform the way data is optimised and delivered to partners, employees and internal systems,” the release said.

“Fragmented, siloed data can now be streamlined for seamless data availability. VIL will also be able to combine insights from the big data platform and better leverage cloud native technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance revenues, reduce costs and elevate customer experiences,” it said.

Currently, insights derived from the data are leveraged for management dashboards, campaign management, network analytics, usage traffic analysis, product analysis, among others.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/6c9eso/article32542514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/vodafone-idea-ropes-in-ibm-for-big-data-platform/article32842857.ece

The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Tuesday said its entry-level model Alto has crossed 40 lakh sales milestone since its launch 20 years ago.

Empowering more than 40 lakh Indian households, Alto proudly celebrates 20 years of setting unmatched industry benchmarks, MSI said in a statement.

The model is testament of an iconic brand that evolved itself with the changing aspirations of young India, it added.

The compact car has undergone multiple changes and upgrades in the last two decades which has made it more contemporary and aligned to the evolving needs of the customer, the auto major said.

“Alto, over the past two decades has changed the way India commutes. It has been ranked as the number one selling car in last 16 years and continues to win hearts and surprise Indian car buyers with its exciting value proposition,” MSI Executive Director (Marketing & Sales) Shashank Srivastava said.

The model has strengthened its appeal with every upgrade and has become the preferred choice for first-time buyers, he added.

“We’ve seen that nearly 76% of Alto customers have selected it as their first car in 2019-20, which has further increased to 84% for the current year,” Mr. Srivastava said.

MSI had launched Alto in 2000. It crossed 10 lakh sales mark in 2008, 20 lakh mark in 2012 and 30 lakh figure in 2016.

The mass acceptance of Alto has helped it to emerge as the largest selling model in the highly competitive passenger car segment every year since the past 16 years, MSI noted.

In 2019-20, 59% of Alto sales came from upcountry markets which has increased to 62% for the current year, it added.

In a regulatory filing, Vedanta said its buy-back offer is deemed to have failed as per the terms of the delisting regulations after promoter Vedanta Resources did not receive the required number of shares to delist the firm. A large number of unconfirmed bids and some technical glitches in the tender process are likely to have contributed to the failure.

The BSE, on October 9 evening showed 137.74 crore shares, out of a total 169.73 crore shares held by the public, to have been offered for sale to promoters, larger than the threshold of 134.12 crore. Some bids, however, were pending confirmation from custodians.

Reconciliation of data led to the number of shares offered for sale being trimmed to 125.47 crore.

368,2020/10/13,The purpose of protests,"Protests cannot be time bound; they will be indefinite if injustice is indefinite

Shaheen Bagh is not past us. The recent order of the Supreme Court on the protests in Shaheen Bagh in Delhi can help the state or the government further subjugate the people, and that too lawfully. The court made the dangerous observation that “the mode and manner of dissent against colonial rule cannot be equated with dissent in a self-ruled democracy.”

The term “self-ruled” is a trap. Mahatma Gandhi had famously said that “we want English rule without the Englishman”. He was blunt: “I have no desire to exchange ‘king log’ for ‘king stork’.”

The temptation to colonise was not unique to the British. The state in itself is coercive, and people have to be eternally alert so that they are not robbed of their sovereignty. One is also compelled to ask: who is this ‘self’ in ‘self-rule’? Does it encompass all our diverse selves?

The answer again comes from Gandhi. He said: “Real Swaraj will come not by the acquisition of authority by a few, but by the acquisition of the capacity by all to resist authority when it is abused. In other words, Swaraj is to be attained by educating the masses to a sense of their capacity to regulate and control authority.”

Resistance to authority or protest is thus intrinsic to citizenship or peoplehood. Protests cannot be made to order. Protests are speech acts. What to speak and how to say it is something you and I decide. Governments cannot be allowed to dictate to you or me in these matters. This is precisely what the Supreme Court has unfortunately tried to do in its judgment on the propriety of the nature of the Shaheen Bagh protests.

When you speak, you expect a willing listener. But protests happen because the conditions for dialogue seem non-existent. Dialogues presuppose equality. People protest because they feel that they have been forced into an unequal situation. Protests attempt to gain or restore equality.

It is not the protests which cause a crisis. Protests arise simply because the governments create a crisis — that too by lawful means, through the passage of discriminatory laws. Protests do not disturb the balance in society; they erupt only because a balance has been upset. Is it not true that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) of 2019 was designed to upset the equilibrium in society? It was the severe feeling of discrimination inherent in the law which brought not just Muslims but many others out on the streets.

Police action

The CAA not only diminishes Muslims; it demeans India by making discrimination and inequality lawful. The protesters were there not only fighting for their rights, but also for a universal principle which does good to all.

When Muslims and believers in the principle of equal citizenship came out to lodge their protest, they were brutalised by the police. Observers have noted the viciousness of police action in Uttar Pradesh, Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University. Police action was carried out not to maintain order, but to teach the protesters a lesson. The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh had said that he would take revenge on those involved in violence, effectively treating protesters as vandals.

When senior lawyers Indira Jaising and Colin Gonsalves approached the Supreme Court requesting it to restrain the police, the court said first the violence on the streets needed to stop. The court effectively negated the right to protest then. It failed the people.

It was this impossible situation which led to the imagination of Shaheen Bagh. It has been rightly observed that the court should have thought about the compulsion of the protesters to choose a site like this, which is not in the centre of the capital.

Many Shaheen Baghs across India are celebrated, but should lead institutions like the Supreme Court to introspect and take a hard look at the Indian reality where Muslim women do not feel safe and comfortable to protest in spaces which are available to other sections of the society? Shaheen Bagh was a choice arising out of a huge trust deficit in society, which has only been aggravated by this majoritarian regime.

Balancing two rights

The court was hearing a petition by a citizen who felt aggrieved by the Shaheen Bagh sit-in as the protest and, as a consequence, the blocked roads had deprived him of his right to mobility. The court equated the two and felt that there had to be a balance between the right to mobility and the right to protest. The court was convinced that the prolonged sit-in caused traffic snarls and violated the right to mobility of the people.

The court did not feel the need to find out if the traffic congestion was entirely due to the protests or whether it was caused by the Delhi Police and the Uttar Pradesh Police which had blocked alternate roads leading to the capital. It did not ask the police why were they causing inconvenience to the commuters by closing certain routes. When asked about the same during the protest, the police said it was “a security measure”. Was this not done to create animosity against the protesters? Should this not have been treated as a clever way of instigating violence against the protesters? Why were they turning one section of society against the other?

The court thought it fit to send interlocutors to the protesters to persuade them to stop the sit-in, but it did not ask the government a simple question: why was it not talking to the protesters? Why were its Ministers spewing venom against them, instigating violence against them?

The court accepts that democracy is not democracy if dissent is disallowed, but it says protests cannot be indefinite and have to be done in designated spaces. Protests are not done for the sake of pleasure. It has to be appreciated that peaceful protesters endure suffering to force the unjust party or the powers that be to speak to them. Protests cannot be time bound. They’ll be indefinite if injustice is indefinite.

369,2020/10/13,Towards cleaner air in Delhi,"Controlling emissions, reducing private vehicles and increasing electric vehicles could help

Every year, Diwali fireworks blanket Delhi in a haze, compounding air pollution’s health risks, particularly to children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses. The difference this year is that rare respite from pollution as COVID-19 slammed the brakes on economic activity. But with air pollution returning to pre-COVID levels, it is opportune that the Delhi administration has launched a major anti-pollution campaign this month.

The campaign is rightly focused on cutting the deadly smoke from thermal plants and brick kilns in the National Capital Region as well as on chemical treatment of stubble burning from nearby States. Delhi’s long-term solution will depend importantly also on abating emissions from transportation. This agenda could cut air pollution from all sources combined by one-quarter to one-third by 2025, which, if sustained, could extend people’s lives by two-three years, ameliorating respiratory complications from COVID-19.

Air pollution before COVID-19 was dire. Particulate matter, PM2.5 and PM10, exceed national standards and the more stringent World Health Organization limits. Delhi’s toxic air also contains high doses of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. The lack of wind worsens the pollutant concentration.

Delhi needs a 65% reduction to meet the national standards for PM2.5. Vehicles, including trucks and two-wheelers, contribute 20%-40% of the PM2.5 concentrations. Tackling vehicle emissions would be one part of the agenda, as in comparable situations in Bangkok, Beijing, and Mexico City. A three-part action comprises emissions standards, public transport, and electric vehicles.

Control emissions

The first part is stricter enforcement of emission controls — and a willingness to impose tougher penalties. Two-wheelers and three-wheelers were as important as cars and lorries in Beijing’s experience. Bangkok ramped up inspection and maintenance to cut emissions. The first order of business is to implement the national standards. Emission testing of vehicles under Delhi’s Pollution Under Control Policy was only 25%.

The second prong is reducing private vehicles on the road by strengthening public transport. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems in Mexico City, Bogota, Istanbul, and Johannesburg show how the sizeable investment cost is more than offset by the benefits, and that financing pays off. Delhi has lessons from its BRT experience in designating better BRT lanes, improving the ticketing system and synchronising with the Metro. The Supreme Court’s ruling to increase Delhi’s bus fleet and align it with the Metro network must be carried out. The ‘odd-even’ number plate policy can help, but the system should reduce exemptions, allow a longer implementation period, and complement it with other measures.

A longer-term solution

The third prong, even if longer term, involves electric vehicles (EVs). Subsidies and investment will be needed to ensure that EVs are used to a meaningful scale, without fossil fuels for charging them. The Delhi government’s three-year policy aims to make EVs account for a quarter of the new vehicles registered in the capital by 2024. EVs will gain from purchase incentives, scrappage benefits on older vehicles, loans at favourable interest and a waiver of road taxes.

Transport solutions need to be one part of pollution abatement that includes industry and agriculture. Delhi’s own actions will not work if the pollution from neighbouring States is not addressed head on.

Technical solutions need to be underpinned by coordination and transparency across Central, State, and local governments. Public opinion matters. Citizen participation and the media are vital for sharing the message on pollution and health, using data such as those from the Central Pollution Control Board. It is a matter of prioritising people’s health and a brighter future. Once the pandemic is over, Delhi must not stumble into yet another public health emergency. The time to act is now.

370,2020/10/13,The tyranny of TRPs,"Who should regulate channels and how should they be regulated?

Nothing can better describe the current TRP (target rating points) controversy better than the Hindi proverb ‘Hamaam mein sab nange hain (Everyone is naked in a public bath)’. Before understanding the controversy, nay scam, let’s understand the ecosystem at play.

In India, no one wants to be regulated. The judges believe that they can self-regulate better than the National Judicial Appointments Commission ever can. The media, especially television media, swears by self-regulation. Energy regulators are mostly parking places for retired civil servants, few of whom have the guts to implement genuine ‘open access’ or tariff fixation.

Also read: Republic TV, two others involved in TRP racket: Mumbai police

Today TV is perhaps the single biggest window of entry into any home for any business. About 760 million-800 million individuals view TV in India per week. While TV penetration in rural India is about 52%, in urban India it is about 87%. Of this DTH (Direct to Home) is used by about 70 million-80 million households, cable is used by 60 million, and terrestrial by about 10 million-20 million households. About 550 million individuals tune into the TV daily and spend roughly 3.45 hours per day watching TV. The industry boasts of more than 800 channels across various genres. Of the total revenue of about ₹66,000 crore, about 40% is attributable to advertising and 60% to distribution and subscription services. India’s total advertising market is $10 billion-$12 billion, of which digital advertising is about $2 billion, according to Dentsu in 2020.

The nature of the game

What channels are not admitting is that the TRP system has been rigged for many moons now, by the channels themselves. That is the nature of the game. Channels cannot play the game without rigging the system. In the TAM (Television Audience Measurement) and INTAM (Indian National Television Audience Measurement) days, motorcycle riders used to be sent to follow those from TAM to retrieve data/install meters and identify ‘confidential homes’. Those homes would be given a new plasma TV, in vogue those days. In those households, a particular channel would be turned on and put on mute on the new TV. And the people in the house would continue watching whatever they wanted to on their regular TV sets. Needless to say, TAM and INTAM gave different ratings reports to suit different clients. Soon, they discovered that it was best to have the cake and eat it too, so they merged. When BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) came about, it took over the flawed TAM meters which are now said to constitute about a third of its own metering.

I have unlearnt everything I learnt in statistics to make sense of the fact that about 22,000 bar-o-meters (or 44,000 households) are used to distribute digital advertising goodies worth about ₹25,000 crore. So, a back-of-the-envelope, and not scientific, bar-o-meter equals approximately ₹1 crore of ad revenue, though the geographical coverage is tiny. Don’t ever ask how 22,000 bar-o-meters can be statistically significant to explain a TV viewing universe of 200 million households (Z-Tests and P-values be damned, they matter only for PhD theses, not in the real world).

There are other goodies for media-buying agencies in the form of fees, commissions, kickbacks, both over and under the table. Even a cursory glance at the balance sheets of the top agencies would reveal these staggering amounts. It is no wonder that no advertising agency worth its salt wants to upset the applecart and look at a ‘better’ rating system.

In today’s world of hyperconnectivity, can we not become self-reliant enough to manufacture bar-o-meters connected to the Internet securely which give us not only channel-wise, but also programme-wise and hour-wise data? That way, measurement would be continuous and transparent instead of being discrete, periodic, and tamperable. Netflix and YouTube not only know what you watched and how long you watched it, but also what else you may like and what you may ignore. Why can’t India come up with connected bar-o-meters or set top boxes when almost everything is now down to digital zeros and ones and measurable?

The way forward

What is the way forward? If you take Ofcom or the Federal Communications Commission, the two main independent regulators in the U.K. and the U.S., respectively, they consist usually of government-appointed officials along with distinguished members from the corporate world. But in India, we all disagree on what constitutes ‘independent’. If a government of a particular ideology appoints a regulator, it will be almost certainly deemed partisan. So, it really comes down to this: who do we trust more, the private sector or the government? Do we want BARC ‘self-regulation’ or an independent authority established by a constitutionally elected government? This opens up a Pandora’s box on who should regulate, how they should regulate, and who should regulate the regulators. The hype will end soon, but it looks like nothing is going to change, for ‘Hamaam mein sab nange hain’.

371,2020/10/13,"Gene editing, the good first and then the worries","With the Chemistry Nobel thrusting CRISPR-Cas9 into the limelight, India needs guidelines for gene-editing research

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2020 which was announced on October 7, Wednesday, has two women scientists as its recipients. That, in it, is a first in the sciences. Emmanuelle Charpentier, a French microbiologist working at the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, Germany, and Jennifer A. Doudna, a biochemist from the University of California, Berkeley, U.S. shared the honour “for the development of a method for genome editing”.

Discovery, likely omissions

The two scientists have pioneered the use of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) – Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) system as a gene-editing tool. In a short period of eight years since its discovery, the method has already made a significant impact in biology, medicine, and agriculture. It is not often that one sees practical applications of scientific findings in such a short time. The only other work with such a quick and revolutionary impact, is PCR (polymerase chain reaction) invented by Kary Mullis in 1983.

The Nobel Prize as the most coveted prize, especially in science, often attracts controversy; this year too is no exception.

The discovery of CRISPR can be traced back to 1987. This was when a group of Japanese researchers observed an unusual homologous DNA sequence bearing direct repeats with spacing in a eubacterial gene. Several important discoveries followed. In subsequent years, Francisco Mojica, Rodolphe Barrangou, Luciano Marraffini and Erik Sontheimer discovered CRISPR and showed it to be a bacterial adaptive immune system and to act on DNA targets. A notable discovery on the use of CRISPR as a gene-editing tool was by a Lithuanian biochemist, Virginijus Šikšnys, in 2012. Šikšnys showed that Cas9 could cut purified DNA in a test tube, the same discovery for which both Charpentier and Doudna were given the credit.

Thus, the conspicuous exclusion of Siksnys from this year’s Nobel, especially when the Nobel Prize can be given to three individuals (the will of Alfred Nobel has it that the Prize can only be shared among a maximum of three individuals), is going to raise discussions. This is especially noteworthy when Siksnys along with Charpentier and Doudna shared another coveted award, the Kavli Prize for Nanoscience, in 2018. However, the Nobel committee recognised Charpentier and Doudna as the sole discovers for programming a Cas9 protein to cut a piece of DNA at a specific site with the help of a small piece of RNA, thereby proving the ability of CRISPR-Cas9 to function as a gene-editing tool.

Other notable early contributors to the field that many believe deserve mention are Feng Zhang of Broad Institute of MIT-Harvard and George Church of Harvard. Feng Zhang, a past postdoctoral fellow in Church lab, and Church himself, the named inventor of many genome science methods, have made several early contributions to the field. These notable exclusions may raise controversy, but Church described the reason for the exclusion best. He saw it this way — that Charpentier and Doudna made a discovery, which is what the committee prefers to reward, and he and Zhang were inventors.

In the male-dominated world of science, this year’s Nobel chemistry prize should be widely celebrated worldwide. The recognition that Charpentier and Doudna’s work has received will encourage women to take up science as a career, despite the hard struggle to balance family life and an arduous life in a scientific career. Although CRISPR became a household name for its ease of use, other systems discovered before CRISPR can cleave DNA at specific sites, an example being the Zinc-finger nucleases. In this, Dana Carroll, who developed the system, is another notable exclusion from this year’s chemistry prize. It would have been an excellent choice if the Nobel committee had named Carroll alongside Charpentier and Doudna.

When the world was shocked

In India, there is a long way to go before realising the utility of gene editing for therapeutic applications. That said, we cannot be complacent and wait for a rogue individual or entity to try it out in humans. The world was alarmed by such a mission in 2018 when Chinese scientist He Jiankui edited genes in human embryos using the CRISPR-Cas9 system that were subsequently implanted and resulted in the birth of twin girls. He claimed this was ostensibly to prevent them from contracting HIV, and the incident became known as the case of the first gene-edited babies of the world. Following a global outcry, the World Health Organization formed a panel of gene-editing experts which said “a central registry of all human genome editing research was needed in order to create an open and transparent database of ongoing work”. It called upon WHO “to start setting up such a registry immediately”.

Situation in India

In India, several rules, guidelines, and policies backed by the “Rules for the Manufacture, Use, Import, Export and Storage of Hazardous Microorganisms/Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells, 1989” notified under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, regulate genetically modified organisms. The above Act and the National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research involving human participants, 2017, by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and the Biomedical and Health Research Regulation Bill implies regulation of the gene-editing process. This is especially so in the usage of its language “modification, deletion or removal of parts of heritable material”. However, there is no explicit mention of the term gene editing. It is time that India came up with a specific law to ban germline editing and put out guidelines for conducting gene-editing research giving rise to modified organisms.

372,2020/10/13,Feat of clay: On French Open tennis championship 2020,"The French Open stuck to the script despite the changed circumstances

The 2020 French Open was unlike any previous edition of the Major. The COVID-19 pandemic ensured that players who are usually accustomed to embracing the summer warmth of Paris had to endure the autumnal cold and rain. The new retractable roof over court Philippe-Chatrier, play under lights and the reportedly “slow and heavy” Wilson balls made clay-court tennis drastically different. What was unchanged, however, was Rafael Nadal holding aloft the Coupe des Mousquetaires for a record-extending 13th time in 15 years and the patented trophy biting celebration. The straight sets demolition of World No.1 Novak Djokovic, his toughest rival, brought the Spaniard level with Roger Federer’s men’s record for Grand Slam titles (20) and has set up a mouth-watering 2021. But Nadal’s preparation for the tournament was far from ideal. The coronavirus situation, especially in his home country, had left him deeply distressed. A quarterfinal loss in Rome last month meant that the 34-year-old entered Roland Garros without winning a clay event for the first time in his career. But the way Nadal negated all potentially inhibiting factors, and reached unprecedented heights of excellence against an opponent who was undefeated in five straight Slam finals, was gunning for his 18th Major, and whose only loss in 38 matches this year was through a disqualification in unfortunate circumstances, made the victory probably his best.

What also came to the fore was Nadal’s longevity — 15 years between the first and latest Slam, and a record six Majors after turning 30 — and his drive to constantly seek perfection. Djokovic’s role in this is central. Though they had met 55 times before, very few came when both were at their absolute peaks. Yet, their tactics have continuously evolved like in a cat and mouse game. After the nearly six-hour long Australian Open final defeat to Djokovic in 2012, Nadal spruced up his attacking play. Since the return from the 2015-16 slump, he continuously worked to better his backhand and break out of the losing patterns Djokovic drew him into. Sunday seemed the culmination of all the hard work. While Nadal led Djokovic by just one point in rallies lasting five shots or more (53-52), he crushed the Serb 53-25 in those that had four shots or less. Where Nadal made just nine backhand errors, he drew 26 more from Djokovic’s favoured wing. Over the last fortnight, this first-strike strategy was also perfected by the 19-year-old Iga Swiatek. The Pole felled the tactically astute Sofia Kenin with a ruthless display of power and intelligence to claim her maiden Major without losing a set. The French Open has crowned four straight first-time women’s Grand Slam champions, rewarding styles ranging from all-out attack to nimble-footed craftiness. Swiatek’s all-round game is a worthy addition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/feat-of-clay-on-french-open-tennis-championship-2020/article32837834.ece
373,2020/10/13,Equal stakes: On accommodative politics,"Accommodative politics is often the result of expediency, but it holds intrinsic value

For the first time in nearly 25 years, all members of the Union Cabinet are from a single party, the Bharatiya Janata Party. The death of Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan, three weeks after the Shiromani Akali Dal’s Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Cabinet in protest against legislation that her party sees as anti-farmer, has suddenly created this situation, but it has been in the making for a while. In 2019, the Shiv Sena’s Arvind Sawant resigned from the Cabinet after the party broke with the BJP. In 2014, the BJP won more than half the seats in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party won a majority since 1984. In 2019, the party increased its tally and is not dependent on any other party for the government’s survival, though it has at least two dozen allies in the NDA. Alliance politics had come to be derided as a sign of instability, indecision and policy paralysis in the dominant discourse of Indian politics before 2014. Conversely, the emergence of a single party’s dominance was welcomed as a new era of stability and decisiveness. The BJP chose to be more triumphalist than gracious in its victory. Decisions of far-reaching consequences such as the changes in the status of Jammu and Kashmir and eligibility of citizenship were made with no inputs from regional political groups, including its own allies.

Involvement of regional and smaller parties will only make governance more robust and inclusive at the national level. The tendency to consider regional forces as a hindrance to a national vision is not the BJP’s creation, though it amplified it. The emergence of regional and communitarian politics is in part a response to the Congress’s failure to be sufficiently sensitive and accommodative of various social and linguistic groups. SAD leader Sukhbir Badal flagged this as a lesson for the BJP — that domination can easily lead to a total collapse. In the case of the BJP, its parliamentary majority itself is concentrated in the north and the west of India, and among particular communities. There is a strong case for the party to be more accommodative towards regions and communities that are not part of its political map. The party has taken some steps such as inducting Nirmala Sitharaman, a Tamil, and V. Muraleedharan, a Malayali, in the Union Council of Ministers though the BJP is not dependent on Tamil Nadu or Kerala for its parliamentary majority. Stability is only enhanced when the stakes are widely distributed in a polity. The situation created by the death of Paswan and the resignation of Ms. Badal opens an opportunity for the BJP to re-examine its approach to regions and social groups. Adequate representation in the Council of Ministers is a necessary condition, and a starting point, towards a more consultative decision-making process that might guarantee more desirable outcomes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/equal-stakes-on-accommodative-politics/article32837831.ece
374,2020/10/13,BMRCL opens financial bids for ORR line,"The stretch from Silk Board to K.R. Puram will have 13 stations

The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) on Tuesday opened the financial bids of the long-pending and crucial Outer Ring Road (ORR) line. The managing director of BMRCL said that financial evaluation of the bids will be carried out before awarding the tender.

In December 2019, the BMRCL had floated a tender in two packages for construction of an elevated line from Silk Board to K.R. Puram. Ajay Seth, MD, BMRCL, said that lowest bid cannot be declared before completion of the financial evaluation.

“L&T, AFCONS, GR Infra and NCC had bid for both Package 1 and 2. ITD Cementation and Shankaranarayan Constructions had bid for Package 2,” Mr. Seth said.

The Union government is yet to approve the project. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had written to the Union government seeking early approval for the project, first in June and again in September this year.

The stretch will have stations at Central Silk Board, HSR Layout, Agara, Ibbalur, Bellandur, Kadubeesanahalli, Kodibeesanahalli, Marathahalli, ISRO, Doddanekundi, DRDO sports complex, Saraswathi Nagar and K.R. Puram.

Construction of a flyover loop at Silk Board is also a part of the project.

BMRCL, in the tender document, had stated that it would take 27 months to complete the project. This is the second time that BMRCL had floated the tender.

In December 2018, BMRCL had cancelled a tender citing various reasons, including difficulty in taking possession of land, raising funds, and lower bid by the crisis-hit IL&FS.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/o6fqze/article32847058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGMETROP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bmrcl-opens-financial-bids-for-orr-line/article32847059.ece

The commercial office space absorption has been picking up in Bengaluru, with Q3 2020, according to a statement from property consultant Colliers International. During January-September 2020, Bengaluru accounted for 30% of the total gross absorption of 6.5 million sq.ft. of commercial property in the country, with around 2 million sq.ft., in the QoQ period.

The rise in leasing activity signals that occupiers are returning to the drawing board to close ongoing deals that were stalled earlier while the landlords are being flexible, added Colliers.

Tendering process to set up virtual multi-speciality clinics at primary health centres (PHCs) in Bengaluru is set to start within a week.

This was decided at a meeting of Deputy Chief Minister Ashwath Narayana with BBMP health officials on Tuesday. The facility would enable patients avail of the services of specialists in addition to the existing services available in the PHCs.

One such centre will be established in each legislative constituency of the city in the first phase. Later, this would be extended to all the PHCs in the city.

BBMP officials felt the time is conducive for enhanced digitisation of health services in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As per the proposed model, any patient could walk into a PHC and get registered by providing the Aadhaar card. The digital clinic centre would connect the patient to the specialists concerned who would be in the E-Command Health Centre. Later, this would enable diagnostics, doctor’s examination, the release of prescription, and other services.

“This would result in over 60% reduction in bed days, admissions and costs.

The police said Ravishankar had claimed that Ashwin was an important link between him and drug peddlers, and that Ashwin would often help him procure drugs.

CCB officials had formed special teams to trace Ashwin. His arrest might help the CCB get stronger evidence against the accused. He might also help the CCB get fresh leads in the case, sources said.

Meanwhile, the CCB special teams continue their search for the accused who are on the run.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/drugs-probe-accused-arrested/article32846169.ece
379,2020/10/13,HC notice to State on movement of vehicles through Cubbon Park,"PIL petition seeks a ban on such movement

The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition seeking a ban on the movement of vehicles inside Cubbon Park.

A division bench comprising Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda passed the order on a PIL petition filed by Cubbon Park Walkers’ Association Bangalore.

The petitioner has pointed out that Cubbon Park was closed for movement of vehicles during the lockdown, and, as a result, the pollution level was very low and had helped walkers and other visitors.

“It is imperative that Cubbon Park be preserved and protected by completely banning any vehicular movement. The lockdown restrictions had witnessed the emergence of clean air in Cubbon Park, which was felt by people in the offices and court buildings situated in the vicinity of Cubbon Park,” the petitioner claimed.

The petitioner has pointed out that the Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) had on September 2, 2020 written to the Secretary, Department of Horticulture recommending closure of the park for both vehicular traffic and parking of vehicles. The DULT had examined the issue of allowing traffic though Cubbon Park following representations received from various groups for banning traffic.

Any decision to allow movement of vehicular traffic through Cubbon Park contrary to recommendations of the DULT would violate the right to clean air to which every citizen is entitled to as such a right is part of the right to protection of life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner has argued.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/948ctn/article32846078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGPARKP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-notice-to-state-on-movement-of-vehicles-through-cubbon-park/article32846079.ece

382,2020/10/13,Mahalingapuram residents complain about ganja menace,"Residents of the locality also complained of transgender people taking part in anti-social activities in the locality

Residents of Mahalingapuram are reportedly irked by two problems — ganja sales and solicitation in the public. They claim that there has been no action from police despite repeated complaints.



There are over 1,000 residents in Mahalingapuram. They claim that few people are occupying the dark alleys in the nights for the past five years and involved in solicitation.



""They stand at different points in the locality. When residents walk past, they demand money from us too. It has become a huge problem,"" said K. Sekhar, committee member of Mahalingapuram Resident Welfare Association.



He said that some time ago, he approached Prem Anand Sinha, the then Addditional Commissioner of police regarding the problem. ""There used to be container trucks parked in the locality and all the anti-social activities used to happen behind it. He asked his personnel to remove the lorries and the problem was brought under control,"" he explained.



However recently, the problem has aggravted again. G G Jayaraman, a resident of the locality, has mailed a complaint to the City Police Commissioner about the issue on October 2.



""Two days ago some policeman called and said that they will look into the complaint. But as of now nothing has happened. Residents, especially women and children, are not able to venture outside after 10 p.m. All this happens despite CCTV cameras installed in the locality and regular patrolling by policemen,"" claimed Mr. Jayaraman.



Another problem highlighted by the residents is the sale of ganja. ""The traders come and stand at designated points and the contraband is sold in just few minutes. We chase them away every day,"" alleged Mr. Sekhar.



A police officer said that he will look into the issue. ""We are filing cases against those who are involved in solicitation and chasing them away. Earlier, there used to be more than 50 of them, now there are one or two,"" said a police officer.



Regarding sale of ganja in the locality, the officer said that it was a false allegation. ""We are closely monitoring it. Contraband sale does not happen here,"" he claimed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/g9yv4j/article32849522.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-mahalingapuram-mvedhan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mahalingapuram-residents-complain-about-ganja-menace/article32843401.ece

An isotope-based teletherapy system for treating patients with cancer is being installed in the Department of Radiotherapy of Government Stanley Medical College Hospital. The equipment will facilitate advanced treatment techniques and reduce treatment time, according to doctors.

With October being observed as Breast Cancer Awareness month, the hospital organised an awareness programme on Monday. The importance of self-examination, early detection methods, screening and investigation modalities for all women, especially those aged above 30, were discussed during the programme. There was emphasis on screening and early diagnosis that led to better outcomes. Every year, around 1,700 cancer patients were managed at the hospital. Over the last 10 years, 1,205 breast cancer patients were treated. The Medical Council of India has sanctioned four DM post graduate seats for the Medical Oncology department for the academic year 2020-2021, a press release said.

Collector R. Seethalakshmi and T. Sabitha, deputy director of medical education, took part in the programme. Cancer survivors participated. P.

384,2020/10/13,‘ECMO support can help severely affected COVID-19 patients’,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support can help in treating patients whose lungs are completely affected due to COVID-19, said Mohamed Rela, chairman and managing director, Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre (RIMC), here on Monday.

He was speaking at a function organised to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between RIMC and KIMS Hospitals, located in Telangana, to set up a Comprehensive Centre of Excellence for Heart and Lung Transplant.

He said if a person’s lungs were affected 100% due to COVID-19, putting the person on ventilator support will not help. “In such cases, ECMO support can be used as a bridge to either help lungs recover or until a transplant is possible,” he said.

Pointing out that treatment options and protocols were evolving continuously for the novel disease, he said ECMO support was proving to be useful for patients who otherwise have no hope for survival.

“ECMO can be used to take over the functioning of both the heart and lungs. In COVID-19 cases, we mostly use it just for lungs. The idea is to put the patients on ECMO support, treat them so that their lungs recover and then take them off ECMO,” he said.

He said RIMC, which is starting ECMO support, will soon start performing heart and lung transplants. “We already have a patient, who was put on ECMO support two days ago,” he said.

A statement by the hospital said Sandeep Attawar, programme director and chair, KIMS Institute of Heart and Lung Transplantation, will provide his expertise to the team from RIMC to provide ECMO support, and to perform heart and lung transplants at the hospital.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ecmo-support-can-help-severely-affected-covid-19-patients/article32838852.ece

386,2020/10/13,DHFL Promoters granted bail,"They were directed to make a deposit of ₹50 lakh each

A special court for cases under the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interest of Depositors Act (TNPID) on Monday granted conditional bail to Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) promoters, Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan, who were arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the CB-CID in connection with cheating a firm to the tune of ₹200 crore.

The EOW booked the case based on the complaint of 63 Moons Technologies, Anna Salai. The power agent of the firm, John Deepak, had approached the Madras High Court seeking its direction to register a case. The court had asked the EOW to consider the complaint and take appropriate action in August.

The case stated that 63 Moons Technologies Group had invested ₹200 crore in non-convertible debentures from DHFL, represented by the Wadhawan brothers, on an assurance made by them that they would give a high rate of interest at 9.05% to 9.25% per annum.

The police said the firm offered the dividend for the period 2016-2017 and then failed to pay, which piled up to ₹18 crore.

A first information report was filed against 11 accused, including the Wadhawan brothers. The brothers were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on September 26 and lodged in Taloja jail, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra.

The EOW police team produced the two before a magistrate court in Mumbai, and brought them to Chennai last Wednesday after obtaining a transit warrant. They were lodged in the Central Prison, Puzhal.

Their bail petitions were taken up for hearing. Advocates S. Elambharathi and Abdul Saleem, representing the accused, submitted that the FIR registered against the accused for offences under the TNPID Act was not maintainable as there were no depositors at all as required under the Act.

Allowing the bail applications, special judge S. Sathish Kumar granted the bail and directed the accused to deposit ₹50 lakh each as a condition with two sureties.

Conditions imposed

“On being released, the petitioners should report before the Deputy Superintendent of Police EOW, Chennai, daily at 10.00 a.m. until further orders. They should cooperate with the pending Investigation and should not threaten, influence or hinder witnesses. If there is any violation of the above conditions, the investigation officer is within his powers to move this court for cancellation of bail,” the court order said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dhfl-promoters-granted-bail/article32838817.ece
387,2020/10/13,Chennai-Bangalore Highway strengthening work begins,"Maduravoyal-Sriperumbudur stretch will get a facelift

Work to strengthen a 23 km stretch of the Chennai-Bangalore Highway from Maduravoyal to Sriperumbudur has commenced.

The project will be carried out at a cost of ₹35 crore so that the road will have a smooth riding surface, and will have the strength to carry the enormous volume of traffic that it usually gets on a daily basis. On an average, the road witnesses over 2 lakh passenger car units each day.

According to sources in the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the contractor will lay two layers of bituminous tar on the existing road. They will also install additional signages and will have to complete the work within a period of six months.

This was being taken up following a direction from the Madras High Court, the official added. The NHAI had started making improvements to junctions, including the Vanagaram, Velappanchavady and Parivakkam ones.

Lighting not included

However, the proposal will not include lighting facilities, something that the road is in dire need of. Sangeetha Raghunathan, who frequently visits Kancheepuram, said she preferred the Padappai route despite its cattle menace.

“Although that route also does not have lighting, it is better that this one. Driving at night on the Bangalore road is tough. I take it only if I drive in the afternoon,” she said.

Meanwhile, the NH wing of the State Highways Department has begun marking roadsides to remove encroachments for widening the facility into six lanes along with service roads on either side. “We have enough land with us. But it has been encroached on in many places. We will clear them shortly,” an official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kuso1j/article32838808.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12OCTTHBYPASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-bangalore-highway-strengthening-work-begins/article32838809.ece
388,2020/10/13,Protest organised against illegal sand mining in Tiruvallur,"Owners’ body plans to submit charter of demands to District Collector

The members of the Tamil Nadu Sand Lorry Owners’ Federation held a demonstration on Monday near the Tiruvallur Collectorate seeking measures against illegal sand extraction and transportation in the district.

As there were not enough river sand quarries in the neighbouring districts of Chennai, sand was being illegally extracted from waterbodies and waterways and transported for cheaper rates, they said.

Though several complaints had been made over the past two years, stringent action was yet to be initiated to control the practice, the members said.

The federation’s president S. Yuvaraj said though M-sand was largely being used for construction projects, demand for river sand continued to be robust. Sand was illegally extracted and also adulterated to be sold for a cheaper rate.

On an average, nearly 400-500 loads of sand were illegally transported to the city, he added.

The federation demanded that surveillance cameras be installed in vulnerable areas, including Red Hills Koot Road, Periyapalayam Main Road, Janapanchatram Koot Road and Tamaraipakkam Koot Road, to prevent illegal sand mining and supply.

Members also raised questions about lack of checkposts on arterial roads such as Ponneri High Road and Gummidipoondi Bypass Road. They demanded drone cameras be used to control illegal sand mining and also withdrawal of false cases against lorry drivers.

389,2020/10/13,"Federalism, now a partisan internal dialogue","India could be living through a reprise of the ‘Congress system’, but with significant differences in the BJP’s re-enactment

At the first signs of stress, the grand vision of a nation unified in a singular system of taxation, was supplanted by a policy of every-state-for-itself. Just over three years ago, the introduction of a unified “goods and services tax” (GST) was heralded by a midnight session of Parliament, a theatrical invocation of India’s 1947 “tryst with destiny”. It was a moment of seeming vindication for the vision of a nation united in its singularity, which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have made their own.

Miscued estimates

The triumphalism lived on, but only in the alternative world created by BJP acolytes in the media. In the real world, evidence of seriously miscued revenue estimates, premised upon an ideological rather than pragmatic tax rate, was accumulating at an alarming pace.

The Comptroller and Auditor-General of India (CAG) recently revealed how a cess meant to remedy shortfalls in GST yields, was retained in central government revenues, in violation of all applicable norms. This revelation does little to build trust at a time when the States’ treasuries are running dry and the central government is gratuitously advising them to borrow on the strength of its guarantee. States ruled by the BJP are willing to go along, but others believe that the onus of borrowing should rest with the central government, given that it is the absolute sovereign and enjoys vastly greater taxation rights.

Fiscal deficit and investors

It could be surmised that the central government’s refusal to contemplate the option that Opposition states are urging, stems from legitimate concerns over its fiscal deficit, a parameter in turn seen as crucial to retaining the confidence of foreign institutional investors. Many of these investors who turn over vast sums of money in India’s currency and share markets, have short-term perspectives. Yet, it does little for public confidence that the central government should base policy upon this thin artifice, when the States’ fiscal health is in serious jeopardy.

The central government, in May, sanctioned a higher borrowing limit for States through the current year. In the bargain, it imposed conditionalities which reflected two deep dogmas: enforcing a singular standard for the implementation of policies across a vast and diverse country, and improving India’s ranking as a place for “doing business”. States will have unconditional access to borrowings equivalent to half a percentage point of their gross output. But, subsequently, every tranche of a quarter point will be premised on progress in implementing the “one nation, one ration card” scheme, and improvements in the “ease of doing business”.

“Doing business” is a parameter the World Bank has devised as an indicator of a country’s economic prospects. The Modi government has prided itself on rapid improvements registered in this index since 2014. This, despite criticism that the parameter is indifferent towards issues of equity, welfare and environmental sustainability, and concerns within the World Bank that data manipulations may have distorted estimates.

The agrarian crisis

The “doing business” objective seemingly guided the central government when it introduced and pushed through — despite loudly vented reservations — laws that transform the infrastructure and regulatory processes of agricultural markets. There is a deep crisis in the agrarian sector that most evaluations have concluded, arises from ingrained asymmetries of market power. Absent a remedy for these, the malaise is only likely to be aggravated by the entry of private corporate buyers, who could overwhelm the fragile yet workable systems built up by State governments.

Federalism has always been a contested concept in Indian politics. Aside from the contents and definitions sections, the word “federal” occurs in only one operational article of the Indian Constitution, in reference to the apex judicial body created in colonial times. When this body was transformed into the Supreme Court at the moment the Constitution came into force, the word seemingly lost all operative value. The administrative matter of the distribution of powers and responsibilities between various tiers of the governmental system, was achieved without explicit recognition of federalism as a governing principle.

In actual operational terms, the relationship of Centre and States followed different paradigms through various phases of politics. In the single-party state that India essentially was at the time of Independence, the distribution of powers between Centre and States was transformed into an internal discussion of the Congress.

Evolution of power sharing

The “Congress system”, as the political scientist Rajni Kothari called it, was seen at one time to have sufficient internal flexibility and resilience to absorb all factional pressures and create a grand national synthesis. The challenge to that hegemonic vision came first from the cultural terrain, compelling a reluctant national leadership to concede the principle of the linguistic reorganisation of States. And then, as ambitions of nation-building through rapid industrialisation began to flounder, agrarian interest groups in particular began peeling off, joining other factions to create the possibility of a non-Congress politics.

The Congress lost power in a number of key States in 1967, retaining only a parlous grip at the Centre. Then, as political scientists Suhas Palshikar and Yogendra Yadav have theorised, the polity moved into a new phase, when politics was about “waves” at the national or State level either in favour of, or against the Congress. From 1989 onwards, politics settled into another distinct phase, when outcomes at the national level were the resultant of very separate State-level results. This was a process driven by the emergence of regional parties through the 1970s and 1980s, and the consolidation of Left politics in West Bengal and its continuing relevance in Kerala.

Since emerging in 2014 as the pole around which the polity revolves and underlining that status in 2019, the BJP has taken all the cues, and now seeks to transform federalism into an internal dialogue. There is a hint here, that India could be living through a reprise of the “Congress system” of the 1950s and 1960s. Significant differences exist, though, which could make a difference to the BJP’s re-enactment.

Agriculture subsumed

First, the BJP has grown in most parts of the country by wedging itself firmly into the deepest cultural fault lines in Indian society. This is integral to its ideology and not merely the kind of pragmatic tactical recourse that the Congress on occasion adopted. Second, the Congress’s inattention to the rural agrarian sector was relatively benign, born in its belief that agriculture was a vast reservoir that would gladly yield its surpluses of manpower and product to fuel the growth of the urban industrial frontier. In the BJP’s vision, agriculture is the tail-end of the economy which should be forcibly absorbed into the logic of private enterprise and the aggrandisement of India’s wealthiest business groups.

If there is a parallel to be drawn with the splintering of the Congress system and its replacement by a complex mosaic of politics led by the regions, it is simply this: that the agrarian sector could soon emerge as the force driving change. And typically, these interest groups begin coalescing at the level of State politics and then forge larger unities, which begin to contest the overweening power of the Centre.

390,2020/10/13,"Letters to the Editor — October 13, 2020","Sanitisers and soaps

I write this as the former head, Department of Microbiology, CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Insitute, Mysuru. The report, “Sanitizers, soaps can do damage: experts” (Inside pages, October 12), is likely to send a very wrong message of grave consequences in the present context. There is a confused statement — of intermixing of antibiotics and antimicrobials. Sanitizers and soaps are not antibiotics. They are only antimicrobials meant for surface sanitisation of animate and inanimate objects. For example, one of the common sanitisers used is alcohol (Isopropanol or Ethanol) which is a strong protein denaturant. Its efficacy to inactivate the coronavirus in particular, is assured the moment alcohol comes in contact with the flower-like stubs, the proteinaceous entities projecting on the surface of the coronavirus. Now, soap is a surfactant to remove oil (lipid)-based entities which will target the lipid-based membrane covering the virus. Alcohol-based sanitisers are approved by the World Health Organization and in use for a long time including in medical practice and surgery.

Conventionally, antibiotics are referred to those organic compounds produced by one kind of microorganisms to act against another, say a pathogen. Hence, in nature, the existence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms can be expected in any ecosystem. It is only by the erroneous use of antibiotics that disturbance has been caused to natural ecosystems and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic microorganisms.

Cooperatives, farming

The Centre has not done its homework before pushing through and passing the Farm Bills in a novel coronavirus-affected Parliament where it bulldozed the Opposition’s voice. Earlier, it failed to interact with farmers’ bodies to understand what they felt. The continuing farmers’ protests are an indicator of the resentment which is spreading across India. The Centre’s pro-urban and pro-corporate policies are explicitly visible, seen in the way it seeks advice from MSMEs and other industrial bodies before framing policies for the manufacturing sector. But never before have farmers bodies been united as seen now. Farmers are apprehensive that the big corporates are going to reap the benefits as most farmers are small and marginal farmers with not much understanding of the commercial issues in these laws. Farmers too are in search of solutions. In such a situation, the role of farmers’ cooperatives need to be explored rather than encouraging industrial corporates who are known to profiteer at the expense of farmers.

Pandemic lessons

I find it unfortunate as well as surprising that the Spanish Flu, even with the one of the largest human tolls in modern times by any epidemic, has not found much space in history textbooks. Now, a century later, history seems to be repeating itself. The writer of “Pandemics and the collective consciousness” (Editorial page, October 12) is right in his observations, but one thing needs to be ensured — that we learn the lessons well by not repeating mistakes. This pandemic is neither the first nor the last and we need to be better prepared and equipped to deal with the future.

Rafael Nadal’s hundredth match win at Roland Garros coinciding with his 20th Grand Slam title is probably his greatest win in Paris. To vanquish the indomitable Novak Djokovic in straight sets is a true achievement. It is stupendous to think that a long-haired teenager who was on the court in 2005 would still be dazzling us a good 15 years later. Retired player Nicolás Almagro remarked that Nadal deserves the Eiffel Tower instead of the French Open trophy. Considering the way Nadal has ruled on the Parisian clay these remarks are justified.

391,2020/10/13,HC imposes ₹1 lakh fine on sweet shop owners,"They challenged orders passed by FSSAI

The Bombay High Court on Tuesday imposed a fine of ₹1 lakh on an association of sweet shop owners in Mumbai for challenging two orders passed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Shri Mumbai Mishtanna Vayasai, an association of 250 sweet sellers and shop owners.

The first order dated February 24 made it mandatory for sweet outlets to display from October 1 the date of manufacturing and best before date of non-packaged/loose sweets on sale and the container/tray holding them. The FSSAI order also mentioned instances of stale/expired sweets being sold to customers.

The second FSSAI order dated September 30 said that the rule was applicable only to Indian sweets and labels on container/tray holding the sweets can be in the local language.

However, Shri Mumbai Mishtanna Vayasai contended that the FSSAI orders were discriminatory. The plea mentioned that as per an order dated September 25, Food Business Operators were asked to also display the “date of manufacturing”, but the rule was only voluntary, not mandatory.

Dismissing the PIL, the court said, “The petitioner seeks to undo what the authority proposed to do for the benefit of consumers and therefore it is thoroughly misconceived.

392,2020/10/13,‘My Hindutva does not require your certificate’: Uddhav Thackeray to Governor Koshyari,"Maharashtra Chief Minister and State Governor spar over reopening places of worship across the State.

In yet another face-off between Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray over opening of temples in the State, the latter told Mr. Koshyari that he does not require certificate of Hindutva from the Governor.

Mr. Koshyari, who had been visited by several delegations of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders demanding opening of temples, had sent a letter to Mr. Thackeray on October 12. The letter made political comments asking Mr. Thackeray as to whether he has suddenly turned “secular” and whether he is receiving “divine premonition” to keep postponing reopening of places of worships.

Replying to Mr. Koshyari, the Maharashtra CM in his letter of October 13 said, “I appreciate the mention of Hindutva in your letter, but my Hindutva does not require your certificate. My Hindutva does not appreciate welcoming a person with a smile, who termed my state or the capital of my state as Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.” Actor Kangana Ranaut who had termed Mumbai as PoK was allowed a visit by Mr. Koshyari at Raj Bhavan.

“Do you consider opening temples as Hindutva and not opening them as secularism? Then what about the Constitution on which you were sworn in as Governor? Secularism is a core of Constitution. Don't you follow Constitution?” asked Mr. Thackeray.

“You seem puzzled as to whether I get divine premonition. I am not as great as you are and therefore I have no such experiences like you. I only observe good and bad things happening in other states and work honestly to do better in Maharashtra,” he said.

Taunting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s abrupt call for lockdown, Mr. Thackeray said, “Government’s priority is to save their lives while safeguarding their emotions and beliefs. As it is wrong to abruptly implement lockdown, it is wrong to suddenly revoke it,” he said, informing that the State government is presently undertaking ‘My family, My responsibility’ campaign which involved door-to-door health check-up. “Maharashtra is the only state in the country to do so,” he said.

Exposing the politics behind the demand of opening places of worshipping, Mr Thackeray said all three letters attached by Mr. Koshyari were from the BJP and its supporters. “It could be a coincidence. Let that be. The state government is seriously thinking over these demands and decision in this regard will be taken at the earliest,” said Mr Thackeray.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/adpezh/article32842074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN13UDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/my-hindutva-does-not-require-your-certificate-uddhav-thackeray-to-governor-koshyari/article32842004.ece

394,2020/10/13,"At 7,089 cases, State sees lowest surge in 2 months","165 deaths in State; 1,620 cases in Mumbai

Maharashtra saw its lowest case surge in over two months, with 7,089 new COVID-19 cases being reported on Monday, taking its total case tally to 15,35,315. With 165 fatalities, the death toll has climbed to 40,514.

While 15,656 patients were discharged, active cases dipped below the 2.20 lakh mark, and stands at 2,12,439. The cumulative recoveries have risen to 12,81,896. “The State’s recovery rate has reached 83.49%, while the case fatality rate is 2.64%,” said State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate.

The low surge must be viewed in the context of only 54,000 samples being tested in the past 24 hours as opposed to the daily average of over 80,000 samples.

Pune district reported less than 1,000 cases to take its tally to 3,16,731, while 12 deaths saw its toll climb to 6,260. As per the Pune district administration, the recovery rate has exceeded 87% and the active cases have dipped below 32,000.

Mumbai reported 1,620 cases to take its tally to 2,31,066, of which 25,380 are active. With 36 deaths, the city’s toll has risen to 9,469.

Kolhapur recorded just 77 new cases to take its total case tally to 45,924, of which 4,098 are active. Hearteningly, not a single death was reported in the last 24 hours.

In north Maharashtra, Nashik district reported its lowest surge in nearly three months, with less than 180 cases taking its total tally to 85,906, of which 14,388 are active. With only a single fatality, the district’s total death has reached 1,449.

Neighbouring Jalgaon, too, once a hotspot in north Maharashtra, reported its lowest spike ever with just 75 cases and just one death as its total case tally reached 51,146, of which 4,820 are active, while its death toll stood at 1,309.

Ahmednagar reported 336 cases as its total case tally rose to 50,473, of which 7,411 are active . Three deaths took the total toll to 791.

395,2020/10/13,Pune division cautious ahead of festive season,"Focus on increasing bed capacity

Despite a continuing trend of a dip in COVID-19 cases across the five districts in Pune division, authorities have warned that a complacent attitude during the upcoming festive season could result in a further spike.

From being India’s worst-hit district, Pune’s active cases have come down below 32,000, currently standing at a little over 31,000, — a marked improvement from its previous figure of 40,000 exactly a month ago. The district has reported 3.06 lakh cases and until three weeks ago, was reporting alarming daily spikes of over 4,000 cases. That has reduced to less than 1,500 cases in the past fortnight, with Pune’s recovery rate surging past 87%.

“This dip in cases must be kept up even during the crucial festive season. One must bear in mind that Pune’s case positivity rate, while down from 30% from 10 days ago, is still hovering between 20-23%, which is still high,” said Pune Divisional Commissioner Saurabh Rao. He said the positivity rate had dipped noticeably to 15-18% in Pimpri-Chinchwad, while the Pune Municipal Corporation stood somewhat on the higher side, between 21-23%.

Pune Zilla Parishad CEO Ayush Prasad said the case doubling rate in Pune Rural region had improved to 32 from the previous figure of 27 in the first week of October. Despite these positive signs, Mr. Rao said authorities were not taking it easy and were focussing on increasing the bed capacity across the district’s hospitals.

“We are striving to increase beds each day and have now reached a situation where we are in a relatively comfortable position with regard to critical care beds. Sassoon Hospital has increased its capacity by more than 45-50% and Ruby Hall by nearly 40%,” he said. He observed that Pune was fortunate that the surge last month did not happen at every place at the same time.

He noted that the Old Pune area or the Peth area, which had constituted the major clusters during the surge in the months after March, had more or less stabilised. “It is the peripheral areas and semi-urban areas in Pune that we are focussing on,” he said.

One notable aspect of the case dip across Pune division — which comprises Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli Solapur and Pune disricts — has been the steady decline of cases and fatalities in Solapur, hitherto the worst-hit district after Pune.

Mr. Rao said quality contact tracing and intense focus on ‘super-spreaders’ had been the key in checking the spread of the contagion in Solapur. Solapur currently has more than 5,000 active cases from more than 7,500 active cases a fortnight ago — more than a 30% dip.

“At one point, the situation was rather grim in Solapur. However, a gradual decline in cases began since the past month. Initially, experts felt it was artificial as the major focus was on antigen testing. But slowly, we became convinced that cases were indeed declining as the numbers stabilised,” said the Divisional Commissioner.

Mr. Rao said the Solapur district administration had worked on decentralising health facilities in various parts of the district in parallel with its focus on strategic testing as well as the timely identification of positive cases.

While Kolhapur and Sangli were improving, he, however, expressed concern about the surging cases in Satara, which is currently the worst-afflicted in the division after Pune. Satara has more than 6,500 active cases (from a total case tally exceeding 41,000) and more than 1,350 fatalities.

While acknowledging that the testing in Pune had declined slightly — from an average of 14,000 samples per day to 12,000 – as a number of lab technicians had tested positive, Mr. Rao assured that the capacity would be increased soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pune-division-cautious-ahead-of-festive-season/article32838276.ece
396,2020/10/13,Powerless Monday for Maximum City,"Grid failure results in massive outage; train services, road traffic hit

An unprecedented power outage brought Mumbai to a standstill on Monday, affected local trains, left several people trapped in lifts, and led to chaos on roads after signals went on a blink.

The outage affected the entire city and suburbs including neighbouring Thane, Navi Mumbai and other parts of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) leaving India’s financial capital paralysed for more than four hours. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray ordered a technical audit of the incident in the afternoon.

The misery of Mumbaikars began around 10.10 a.m. with the tripping at the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited’s (MahaTransco) Kalwa-Padgha centre. It affected lakhs of domestic consumers of the State government, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport, Adani Electricity Mumbai (AEML) and Tata Power.

Power Minister Nitin Raut said, circuit 1 of 400kV GIS centre at Kalwa-Padgha of MahaTransco was undergoing repair and maintenance and the load was on circuit 2. “Some technical problem in circuit 2 led to problems in power supply to Mumbai and Thane,” he said. The CM met Mr. Raut and private power companies in the afternoon and ordered a technical audit into the incident. “Technical faults need to be identified. Those who are responsible should be identified,” he said.

While civic authorities claimed that essential services, especially Covid care centres and hospitals too faced power outage, diesel generators were automatically put into use. Mumbai’s water supply was hit and is likely to stay affected on Tuesday.

The outage affected train services on the western, central and harbour lines. Commuters stuck on trains could be seen walking on the tracks. According to Central Railway officials, harbour line services were restored at 10.55 a.m. and central line on 12.26 p.m. “WR’s suburban train services were restored between Churchgate & Borivali at 12.20 hrs. Services were already on between Borivali & Virar,” a Western Railway official said.

CR also rescheduled five long-distance trains — two to Gorakhpur and one each to Darbhanga, Varanasi and Thiruvananthapuram.

It was a nightmare for some employees working in an upscale business complex in central Mumbai who found themselves stuck in an elevator during times of social distancing. They were evacuated after some time.

Mumbai and metropolitan areas get their power supply through Kalwa sub-station where four 400 kV lines join. In addition, Tata and Adani together supply 1800 MW power. On October 10, 400 kV Kalwa-Talegaon (Power grid) was closed due to a problem with its conductor. Restoration work is on, but there are delays since it is in a remote hilly area.

Early on Monday morning, at 4.33 a.m., the Kalwa-Padgha line-1 malfunctioned due to over voltage. The power supply to Mumbai was through the remaining two lines. However, the 400 kV Kalwa-Padgha line-2 too malfunctioned at 10.01 a.m., resulting in islanding, of Mumbai’s power supply, which was further affected as 500 MW Tata Power plant and 250 MW AEML’s Dahanu plant were closed. , said the state government.

An AEML spokesman said, “Due to transmission network failure outside of our system at 10.05 this morning, the power grid saw outages across utilities in Mumbai. However, the AEML distribution system operated islanding facility successfully and continued power supply to vital installations with the help of the Dahanu Thermal Power Station. We wish we had more power for which we are dependent on grid input. Power supply to remaining consumers is being restored in a phased manner.”

Tata Power, in its statement, said, “It is understood that MSETCL had taken emergency shutdown for 400 kV Kalwa-Padghe line-1 at 6.54 hrs this morning to attend fault and was expected to be revived by 09:30 hrs, but could not revive it. As understood, at 09:58 hrs 400 kV Kalwa-Padghe-2 carrying 633 MW tripped. The flow on Pune-Kharghar rose up to 900 MW and tripped at 10:00 hrs, resulting in load drop in Mumbai system. Mumbai’s islanding system that saves the city from major power outages was separated, however it could not hold as additional 900 MW load dropped at 10:05 hrs.”

It added, “Tata Power swiftly began restoration work to bring back supply from the three hydro units and Trombay gas and coal units as soon as the MSETCL transmission lines were connected. Tata Power started restoring supply to its consumers progressively from 12 noon onwards.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/zvpg0/article32838195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMPOWER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/powerless-monday-for-maximum-city/article32838198.ece

398,2020/10/13,Lessons from the master for India’s talented youngsters,"de Villiers’ unbeaten 73 against KKR must count as the innings of the tournament and was a wonderful lesson in adapting to surfaces

It’s always interesting when an expert slips out of his ‘professional’ garb and allows a child-like excitement to infiltrate his comments.

Such a moment occurred when the great Sunil Gavaskar, in the midst of the artificial enthusiasms all around at the IPL, spontaneously exclaimed while watching A.B. de Villiers strike a six: “Look at his follow-through! Look at the way his bat finishes above his left shoulder!” The six was arresting enough, but what caught Gavaskar’s fancy was the technical purity of the shot.

Cricket has always had an element of the Gita about it: the batsman’s job is to do his duty (by getting everything right) and leave the result to take care of itself. If you play correctly but no run is added to the score, that’s a part of the game. If your feet and hands and head and body mimic the textbook and you score six, then that is perfection. You are hailed both for the process and the product, and there can be no higher praise.

Definition of perfection

Such moments do not come often in a T20 game where the definition of perfection is different: perfection in batting is a six, or a score of 720 off the 120 deliveries bowled. It doesn’t matter if that six comes off the edge of the bat, when an attempted on-drive sees the ball end up at third man, or, as in the case of a Virat Kohli special recently, comes off the back of the bat. The ends justify the means.

Looking good is not an option when scoring fast is the alternative. Two batsmen, Kohli and K.L. Rahul, look good while scoring runs, but already there is a debate about whether Rahul, the highest aggregate scorer (as of Oct. 12), is doing it quickly enough.

For this is another quirk of the format. You work backwards from the result to decide whether an innings is good or not. This is a departure from the old thinking where an innings stood by itself regardless of the result. Batsmen sometimes prided themselves on a lotus-like approach, their innings blossoming above the mess the rest of the team might make.

A chanceless century in a lost cause is lauded in First Class cricket; in T20 it brings out the critic in even the casual viewer.

Rahul might have made a century and three 50s in seven games at a strike rate of 135, but his team Kings XI Punjab are struggling at the bottom. Such is the cruelty of the game. He and Kohli are probably the two players least drawn to what might be considered ‘ugly’ strokes. It doesn’t matter. Was the match won or lost? That is the only question T20 asks. Everything else is a bonus.

A.B. de Villiers’ unbeaten 73 off 33 balls (strike rate 221) must count as the innings of the tournament so far, and a wonderful lesson in adapting to surfaces for youngsters whether playing or watching. Sharjah was slow, and batsmen who went out to meet the ball, as Kohli discovered, often ended up in a tangle. de Villiers let the ball come on to him, and seemed to have all the time in the world to send it screeching or soaring to any part of the ground.

Putting it in context

One of the problems with traditional cricket statistics is that they don’t give us the context. Newer methods place de Villiers’ effort in perspective.

His strike rate was more than twice that of the batsmen in either team combined. He even made Kohli look out of sorts, causing his skipper to cheer when an edge ran down for his only boundary.

At the halfway stage of the league phase, even if some franchises haven’t done too well, India have done well. A generation of young batsmen, bowlers and wicketkeepers is being honed to perform at the international level.

This was high on the organisers’ wish list when the tournament was being sold to the public in its inaugural year. It was put about that the IPL would ensure India had ready-made players for international white ball tournaments, maybe even Test cricket.

The next T20 World Cup is in India about a year from now, and it is sobering to realise that India haven’t won the tournament since 2007 when they surprised the world (and themselves) by winning at first attempt.

Talented youngsters with confidence and style like Shubman Gill, Devdutt Padikkal, Ravi Bishnoi, Priyam Garg, Ishan Kishan, Riyan Parag, T. Natarajan, Kamlesh Nagarkoti — many born in this century — can add their names to those who have been around for a while and push for selection.

Collector T. Arun on Monday issued an order attaching petrol and diesel outlets run by the Amudhasurabhi wing of the Puducherry Cooperative Wholesale Stores on ECR, Kottupalayam, Lawspet, for not complying with the earlier directive to provide uninterrupted supply of petroleum products to government vehicles.

Mr. Arun, in his order, said the outlet would be attached to the office of Tahsildar-cum-Incident Commander, Oulgaret taluk, to ensure uninterrupted supply of petroleum products to government vehicles for facilitating administrative continuity.

The retail outlet would be operated by the managing director, cooperative building centre.

The concerned agency was bound to ensure sufficient stock and supply of gas for the government vehicles.

Last week, the Collector had issued a warning to the striking employees to resume work so as to ensure supply of petrol and diesel for government vehicles.

400,2020/10/13,U.T. to launch study to assess socio-economic status of women,"Initiative will help frame policies and make interventions based on the findings

The government will soon launch a study to assess the status of women in the Union Territory so as to frame policies and make need-based interventions based on the findings.

The Department of Women and Child Development had already floated an expression of interest inviting reputed research organisations and non-governmental organisations to participate in the selection process.

“We hope to select an organisation soon to carry out the survey in all the four regions of the Union Territory. It will be an elaborate survey to create a database on the status of women. The statistics collected would be the basis for framing policies and intervention programmes aimed to empower women in Union Territory,” Director of Women and Child Development S. Ashokan told The Hindu.

The last date for submitting the EoI is October 21. The study would be conducted in three to six months, he added.

As per the 2011 census, Puducherry is the only Union Territory where the number of women outnumbered the population of men. The Union Territory has 1,037 women per 1,000 men as against the national average of 943 women per 1,000 men.

“So, it is essential to launch a study to find their socio-economic conditions, health and nutritional levels, educational qualifications and their aspirations,” said Mr. Ashokan.

A background paper prepared by the Department said the organisation selected to conduct the study would focus on collecting details of socio-economic status besides gathering details about age of marriage, role in decision making, discrimination faced by them and nature of violence and abuse they faced, if any.

The entrusted organisation would be also tasked with the responsibility to gather information about the impact of various women-centric programmes, schemes and interventions by the government.

It would also gather details about women’s access to institutions that ensured their safety, representation in local governance, political aspirations, awareness level on various laws, availability of legal aids, schemes and programmes, the paper said.

Another critical objective of the study was to find out the freedom available for women for making personal decisions and about their felt needs. Also, the study would cover women’s knowledge about and access to technology.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5uyfyd/article32838977.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THWOMENSTUDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ut-to-launch-study-to-assess-socio-economic-status-of-women/article32838978.ece
401,2020/10/13,Work on ₹20 crore cultural centre nearing completion,"Malladi Krishna Rao inspects site, wants project finished by February

The Old Distillery, a remnant of the French era, is getting a new lease of life with a ₹20-crore cultural centre replete with theatre hall, gymnasium and meditation hall, nearing completion.

Tourism Minister Malladi Krishna Rao who, along with officials, undertook an inspection of the premises on Saturday, issued instructions to expedite the project so that the centre could be commissioned by February next year.

The brewery operated during the French period on the north side of the Promenade Beach. After the premises fell in disuse, the government had settled on the idea of a cultural centre among various options, ranging from a multiplex to a star hotel.

The Department of Tourism is in the process of setting up the cultural centre as a showpiece project that would appeal to tourists and city residents. The old buildings which have become unusable have been demolished and construction is apace at the premises. It is estimated that work is half-way through.

Once ready, the centre would host artists from across the country.

The facilities include a set of 16 sea-facing rooms to accommodate artists and out-of-town tourists, food court, yoga and meditation hall, gymnasium, open-air theatre, ballroom and an amphitheatre with a seating capacity of 200. The architectural aesthetic of the complex, which is coming up on about two acres of land, would also reflect the history and culture of Puducherry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2giz2x/article32838698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PDYCULTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/work-on-20-crore-cultural-centre-nearing-completion/article32838699.ece

405,2020/10/13,‘Evict encroachers from Devarayaneri tank’,"Farmers and residents of Devarayaneri on the outskirts of the Tiruchi have urged the Public Works Department authorities to take expeditious steps to remove encroachments on the vast irrigation tank in their village.

A group of farmers, who petitioned the PWD officials in Tiruchi on Tuesday, alleged that as much as 200 acres of the sprawling tank spread over about 360 acres have been encroached upon by outsiders.

Claiming that the Devarayaneri was among the biggest tanks in Tiruchi district, D.R.Karuppasamy, who led the petitioners, said that the tank has been under encroachments over the past 40 years.

“The tank is fed by the Uyyakondan canal running from the Vazhavanthankottai tank. It also gets rain flows from jungle streams in Pudukottai district. It has a registered ayacut of about 600 acres,” Mr.Karuppasamy said and complained that despite repeated representations the authorities have failed to evict the encroachers.

According to Mr.Karuppasamy and other villages, about 18 acres of land near the tank was given as house site pattas for the ‘narikuravars’ who are settled at Devarayaneri several years back. Taking advantage of this, several persons started encroaching upon the tank. “The encroachers started extending the cultivation area with each passing year and currently about 200 acres is under encroachment,” Mr.Karuppasamy alleged.

Accusing the officials of failing to heed their representations and the High Court directives to remove encroachments from irrigation tanks, Mr.Karuppasamy wondered why the encroachments from the Devarayaneri tank were left untouched even though the authorities had recently carried out eviction drives on the Asoor, Thaeneripatti, Thuvakudi and Navalpattu tanks recently.

“The PWD officials had previously assured that the encroachments from our village tank will be removed. But they have not kept their word yet. If they fail to act, we will intensify our agitation,” said Mr.Karuppasamy.

When contacted, a PWD official said efforts were on to trace the original land records and steps would be taken to remove the encroachments soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/y3xm6o/article32847941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY14-FARMERENC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/evict-encroachers-from-devarayaneri-tank/article32847943.ece
406,2020/10/13,Recruitment process to fill 54 teaching posts in Bharatidasan University hangs in the balance,"The process of recruitment of teaching faculty for 54 vacancies in Bharathidasan University that was initiated last year hangs in the balance, as the hearing on a petition filed by the Association of University Teachers earlier this year is still in progress in the High Court.

After the university initiated the process last year based on the Union Cabinet’s promulgation of the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers Cadre) Ordinance, which paves way for treating the entire institution as a singe unit, AUT opposed the move, citing the the Higher Education Department’s subsequent instruction to State universities to treat every department as a single unit to reserve teaching posts for professors, associate professors and assistant professors.

Eventually, the department had, during June this year, given the green signal to the university to fill the vacancies to the posts of Professor (14), Associate Professor (14) and Assistant Professor (26). The last recruitment process to fill vacancies to regular posts in bulk was carried out in 2012.

According to university sources, there are more than one-third of the regular vacancies out of the sanctioned faculty strength of 240 that have remained unfilled since then.

When the case filed by AUT came up for hearing in the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Monday, it was adjourned to the first week of November. “There will be very little time left for the recruitment process to be completed as the three-year term of the Vice-Chancellor P. Manisankar ends in January 2021,” a senior professor said.

A university source says there may not be difficulty in completing the process within a month as shortlisting of candidates was completed during January when the interviews were also scheduled. However, there could be obstacles cropping up. During 2017, the State Higher Education Department issued a directive to State Universities advising Vice-Chancellors to avoid recruiting or taking crucial policy decisions during the last three months of tenure.

In any case, since the knotty problem — whether to treat the institution or the department as a single unit for the purpose of recruitment — has not been resolved, the chances of filling the posts soon appear dim, senior professors say.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/recruitment-process-to-fill-54-teaching-posts-in-bharatidasan-university-hangs-in-the-balance/article32847903.ece

409,2020/10/13,Dalit girl from Anitha’s native village to pursue medical course,"Three years after S. Anitha of Kuzhumur in Ariyalur district ended her life, unable to get an MBBS seat through the National Eligibility- cum-Entrance Test (NEET), the dream of another girl hailing from the village of studying medicine has become a reality.

Daughter of daily wage earners Shankar and Dhanalakshmi, S. Soundarya will fly to the Philippines to pursue medical education, free of cost, at the Davao Medical Education School Foundation, thanks to a private sponsor. Besides the expenditure for her education, her boarding, food and transport expenses during the period of her study will be sponsored by Transworld Educare Private Limited.

Soundarya’s ambition to become a doctor came to be known to Anitha’s brother S.A Manirathnam, who is running a charitable trust in memory of his sister at the village.

“The medical institute’s office at Mahabalipuram near Chennai, which wanted to help a poor girl pursue medicine in memory of Anitha, got in touch with me. That was when I told them about Soundarya’s ambition and her poor economic background,” said Mr. Manirathnam, managing trustee of Dr. Anitha Memorial Charitable Trust.

A representative from the institute in Chennai came to Kuzhumur a few days ago and interacted with Mr. Manirathnam and Ms. Soundarya to ascertain the girl’s wish.

Ms. Soundarya, who had completed Plus Two in a higher secondary school at Kuzhumur with 410 out of 600 marks, said she was sceptical about her chance of studying medicine owing to her economic background and she might be at a disadvantage because of the NEET.

Soundarya’s family runs on the wages earned by her parents and her elder brother, who works in Chennai as a labourer after completing Plus Two. Her elder sister is pursuing electrical and electronics engineering at a private college near Tiruchi.

“I had almost decided to take up law or some other degree course when this opportunity came knocking at my door,” she said, thanking Mr. Manirathnam for the help and motivation.

“I see an Anitha in Soundarya and want her dream of becoming a doctor is realised,” Mr. Manirathnam said.

A ‘Free Education Certificate’ from David K Pillai, founder and CEO, Transworld Educare Private Limited, was handed over to Ms. Soundarya a few days ago.

At a meet-the-press programme, organised by Vizag Journalists’ Forum(VJF) here on Monday, Mr. Sreenath said that he was committed to the welfare of journalists, which would be possible only when bogus journalists were sent out. Welfare schemes would be implemented for genuine journalists.

Training classes were conducted for journalists of Visakhapatnam, for the first time in the State, through video conference in view of the COVID-19. Training classes would also be conducted for media persons in other districts to equip them with the necessary skills. Underlining the need for journalists to adapt to the latest technologies, he called upon the gathering to make use of the services of the Academy in this regard.

VJF president Gantla Srinu Babu said that journalists should also be recognised as ‘COVID-19 Warriors’ for their services during the pandemic. He also sought the cooperation of the chairman in securing insurance and house sites for journalists.

424,2020/10/13,"2 die, 2 injured in roof collapse due to heavy rain","Low-lying areas flooded, motorist face a tough time on roads

A woman and her son died and two others suffered injuries when boulders came rolling down the hill slope following heavy rain, crashed onto the retaining wall, resulting in the rubble falling into their house, at Ganapathi Nagar under Gajuwaka Police Station limits, here late on on Sunday night.

The concrete retaining wall fell on the asbestos roof of their house and it collapsed. K. Ramalakshmi, who was eight months pregnant, and her two-year-old son Gyaneswar were trapped under the rubble and died on the spot. Ramalakshmi’s husband Lokanadham and her mother Parvathi sustained injuries, according to the Gajuwaka police.

The bodies were extricated from the rubble by the police with the help of Fire Service personnel, and shifted to the mortuary.

The continual downpour due to a depression in the Bay of Bengal led to rainwater overflowing on the roads at some places and flooding of low-lying areas. The strong winds resulted in the snapping of cable and telephone lines and falling of branches and trees at some places on Monday.

Traffic hit

In some areas like Sankara Matam, the movement of traffic was disrupted for some times as trees fell across the roads. They were cleared by people of nearby areas and GVMC staff. Some of the low lying areas in the city were flooded due to the heavy rain but the water receded later.

GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana said the clogged drains were being cleared on a war-footing.

Rainwater overflowed on the streets and entered the cellar of an apartment near the Ayyappa Swami temple at Sheela Nagar. The residents of the area staged a protest demanding a permanent solution to the problem. They alleged that the unauthorised shops and constructed on the drains, were obstructing the flow of water.

Motorists had a tough time driving through the rainwater, which collected on the road below the railway bridge at Chavulamadhum on Monday.

MLA visit

Meanwhile, Visakhapatnam West MLA PGVR Naidu (Ganababu) visited the Ganapathi Nagar on Monday and met the family members of the victims and expressed his condolences. He appealed to the government to provide relief to the bereaved family members. He advised the officials concerned to initiate relief measures in the low-lying areas submerged due to incessant downpour due to the depression in the Bay of Bengal.

He felt that it was unfortunate that the government and officials had not taken preventive measures, though there was prior information about heavy rains, which resulted in the deaths.

More than 54%* of India’s energy needs were met by coal production in FY19. The country’s energy needs were met overwhelmingly by coal and other fossil fuels; only less than 3% were met by renewable technologies. Energy consumption includes electricity and transport.

At least 6.5 lakh employees work in the fossil fuel supply chain, a fact to be considered while devising fossil fuel phase-out policies.

The calculations are done after converting all the energy sources into a solitary unit: a Tonne of Oil Equivalent. One tonne of oil equivalent is equal to the energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil (=11.63 megawatt-hours).

429,2020/10/13,"Hamir, the ferocious muse","Photographer Arjun Anand presents a closer look at tiger personalities in his book ‘Hamir: The Fallen Prince of Ranthambore’

Arjun Anand was 15 when he first visited Ranthambore National Park in the mid-1990s. He says in hindsight, “It changed my life in many ways.” Having frequented Ranthambore several times in the last 25 years, Arjun has authored his first coffee table wildlife photography book, Hamir: The Fallen Prince of Ranthambore (Pirates publishing), documenting some of the park’s Royal Bengal Tigers — in particular, the fierce and blue-eyed Hamir.

Edited excerpts from an interview:

What was special about Hamir that he became your muse?

I first saw Hamir when he was six to eight months old. He saw me and hid behind his mother. He would pop his head out and look at me and hide again. At times he would look at me, snarl and hide again. This went on for a while. It was like watching a human child playing peekaboo, and observing his bond with his mother (Laila - T41) instantly humanised him in my eyes. After that I’ve never considered him to be an animal.

How frequently do you visit Ranthambore; are there seasonal preferences?

Arjun Anand | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

I’ve been visiting Ranthambore National Park since 1995-96. Initially I would go once or twice a year. As time went by, I started visiting the park more often. For this book, I must have spent about 200 days there, over two-and-a-half years.

Summers are great for sightings but the light is harsh. The heat wears down the tigers and they can look sluggish. The winter light is soft and ideal for photography, but tiger sightings get more rare.

The monsoons are a great time even with limited tiger sightings. The orange coat of the tiger stands out against the lush green foliage, adding vibrancy to the coloured images. If I had to just pick one, it would have to be the winter months.

Would you describe your technique as artistic or documentary wildlife photography, or a combination of both?

I consider my style to be artistic, with high-contrast black and white being my medium of choice. Nature is chaotic but I try to find moments of stillness, where a wild animal looks me straight in the eye. Often, I include foliage into my compositions to show the imperfections in nature and to highlight the moment I share with the wild animals, most often a tiger.

However, because at one point I focussed all my efforts on just one tiger, I did not have the luxury of choice. I had to take what I got and that added a documentary element into the project.

In the book, you mention the importance of being patient. Can you describe an incident where you've had to wait for hours, or days, to get the desired images?

Two instances come to mind. The first was when Hamir (T104) decided to go in search of his own territory. Though I searched all over the park, I couldn’t find him for about 10 days. What made matters worse was that tigers in other parts of the forest were being sighted — but by then I was exclusively working on Hamir. That is the longest dry spell I have had at Ranthambore.

The second long wait was when I wanted an image of the famous tigress Arrowhead (T84) crossing the Rajbagh lake. I had witnessed crossings on many occasions but could not make an image that I would want to put up on my wall. I had to wait three years.

How does understanding tiger personalities help in becoming a better photographer?

Book cover of ‘Hamir: The Fallen Prince of Ranthambore’ | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

When you follow them frequently, you learn about their behaviour and temperament and create images accordingly. Take Hamir (T104), for example. I would not dare approach him; if he approached my safari vehicle, after a point I would instruct the driver to back away. Hamir was aggressive. On the other hand, Noor (T34) and her daughters were docile. I have photographed most of them using wide lenses from distances of less than three feet. The same rule applies to tigers that are shy versus tigers that are bold. Arrowhead (T84), an extremely bold tigress, does not shy away from safari vehicles. Once you identify the characteristics of a tiger, you can decide what kind of image you want to take — stalking, hunting, feeding, relaxing, mating, close-up or habitat shot. The best you can do with a shy tiger is to create a tight portrait before it runs away.

Understanding animal behaviour also enables one to pre-empt the tiger’s next move. If the photographer knows what to expect, they can make the necessary changes to their camera settings or better position themselves. In any genre of photography, being proactive rather than reactive translates to getting a strong aesthetically pleasing image.

Now that Hamir is out of bounds for photographers and visitors, what do you look forward to when you visit Ranthambore?

I’ve had the privilege of photographing a legend, and I don’t say that because he attacked a dozen or so safari vehicles or because he turned maneater. Despite his dubious fame, he was an interesting tiger. Now, he is kept in a separate enclosure in the park. My heart goes out to those who lost their lives and their families. I am saddened that Hamir will never see freedom again but I know that had he not been captured, his rampage would not have ended.

For me, visiting Ranthambore is so much more than photography. Just being out in the wild is a privilege. It’s almost meditative.

You prefer to shoot in black and white but there are colour images as well in the book. How do you decide which works best for an image?

For this book I had to include colour because when I started documenting Hamir (T104) I had to accept what I got. There is this sequence where Hamir is chasing domestic buffaloes on a farm that was inhabited by humans. Had I been choosy, I would not have been able to document this scene. Something like this occurs maybe once in 10 years.

Generally, when making black and white images, you are after contrast over and above good light. I see a lot of younger photographers making the mistake of converting their images to black and white to hide a flaw in the image. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. You have to literally learn to start seeing in black and white.

What’s next?

430,2020/10/13,"Central Pollution Control Board issues notices to Flipkart, Patanjali for flouting Plastic Waste Management rules","In a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal, the CPCB has said the show cause notices have been issued for closure of their operation and environment compensation.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has told the NGT that it has issued show cause notices for closure of operations to Flipkart and Patanjali Peya as they are not registered with it and have not responded to its communications on the matter.

In a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal, the CPCB has said the show cause notice under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, has been issued to these units on October 8, for closure of their operation and environment compensation for non-compliance of provisions of Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules 2018.

The CPCB further informed the NGT that four firms — Hindustan Coca-cola Beverages Pvt Ltd, Pepsico India Holding Pvt Ltd, Bisleri International Pvt Ltd, and Ms NourishCo Beverages Ltd — are registered with CPCB. “However, they have not provided information for evidence based assessment of implementation of action plan for fulfilment of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) liability”.

The documents submitted by them have not been endorsed by State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and accordingly, the show cause notice has been issued to these firms as well.

It also informed the NGT that “Amazon Seller Service Pvt Ltd, Coca-Cola India Pvt Ltd, Parle Agro Pvt Ltd, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp Ltd have been recently granted registration by CPCB as Brand Owner/producer under Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules,2018”.

It told the NGT that they are required to submit quarterly progress reports and comply with conditions stipulated in the registration certificate issued to them.

With regard to the tribunal’s direction on environmental audit of these firms, the CPCB said it has held deliberations with expert agencies on the matter.

“Since, it will be for the first time that such an audit shall be conducted, a committee has been constituted to deliberate and suggest mechanism for conducting environmental audit as well as specify the agencies which can be engaged for such audits,” the CPCB said.

It said that directions under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 has been issued to all SPCBs for identification of the Brand owners/ producers who are operating without registration from them and to take action against the defaulting units as per provisions of PWM Rules, 2018 which may include closure of their operations, and levying Environmental Compensation.

The report said: “Further, CPCB receives applications for registration under Rule 13(2) of PWM Rules. Applications are examined by CPCB and clarification/information, if any, are communicated to the applicants. However, many such applicants have not responded to CPCB’s queries.

“As the applicants are non-compliant during this period, list of such applicants has also been forwarded to the State Board for taking action against the defaulting units as per provision of PWM Rules,2018 which shall include closure of their operations, and levying environmental compensation”.

The NGT has directed the CPCB to conduct environmental audit and recover fine from Amazon and Flipkart for violation of environmental norms.

The green panel observed that the statutory regulators were not taking coercive measures, including invoking of “polluter pays” principle for enforcing the statutory norms against the e-commerce firms.

The CPCB had earlier told the NGT that e-commerce giants need to fulfil their extended producer responsibility under the PWM Rules and need to establish a system for collecting back the plastic waste generated due to the packaging of their products.

“Primary responsibility for collection of used multi-layered plastic sachet or pouches or packaging is of producers, importers and brand owners who introduce the products in the market,” it said.

The submission came in response to a plea filed by a 16-year-old boy who has approached the tribunal to stop e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart from excessive plastic use in their packaging.

Aditya Dubey, through his legal guardian, has pleaded the NGT to direct Amazon and Flipkart to stop excessive use of plastic in packaging the goods delivered by the firms.

In the second plea, Aditya alleged violation of the PWM Rules by Coca-Cola India Pvt Ltd, Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt. Ltd, Pepsico India Holding Pvt Ltd, Bisleri International Pvt Ltd, Parle Agro Pvt Ltd, Patanjali Peya Private Ltd, NourishCo Beverages Ltd, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp Ltd in terms of principle of Extended Producer Liability.

“The e-commerce companies are covered under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. But due to a lack of monitoring and implementation, the respondents continue to use excessive amounts of plastic in wrapping and packaging their sold items,” said the plea, filed through advocate Meenesh Dubey.

Mr. Dubey’s plea had contended that the companies deliver items in cardboard boxes, which are too large as compared to the size of the items being delivered.

“To ensure that the sold items do not move around in the outsized boxes, they wrap the items in multiple layers of plastic sheets and plastic bubble wraps and thereafter fill the large empty spaces in the boxes with additional sheets of single-use plastic,” it had said.

Once goods are delivered, the plastic waste is thrown away in garbage and it ends up at landfill sites, leading to a burden on the earth and damaging the environment, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/qk8dbj/article32391146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19-FLIPKART,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/show-cause-notices-for-closure-issued-to-flipkart-patanjali-over-pwm-rules-cpcb-tells-ngt/article32842827.ece
431,2020/10/13,Our institutions are very patriarchal: WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan,"Dr. Swaminathan says she had faced many kinds of challenges and biases during her ICMR stint.

She is counted among the country’s top scientists and public health experts, but for Soumya Swaminathan, who is the Chief Scientist at the World Health Organization and the former Director General (DG) of India’s top medical research body, the Indian Council of Medical Research, it wasn’t always easy to be heard as a young researcher, and a woman at that. She was often “talked down to” or had her ideas dismissed, Dr. Swaminathan recounted before a global audience at an event on Tuesday.

“I was lucky perhaps that during my school, college days or right through education, even when I was doing my MD, I never felt that I was treated differently as a girl or a woman. Perhaps that is very unusual. It was only after I started my career in a government research institution that I experienced the culture of a male-dominated committee room. That’s when you felt you were being talked down to or made fun of almost. And then you become diffident of expressing your opinion the next time. I was in my thirties,” Dr. Swaminathan said about her time at ICMR, where she was first a part of the Tuberculosis Research Centre in Chennai, later rose to become its Director, and finally the head of the ICMR in New Delhi.

“I was not taken seriously; I was always told what to do, and if I had ideas, they would be shot down. I think that is the way many of our institutions function. They are very patriarchal,” she said at the fourth Women Leaders in Global Health Conference, 2020, which is being organised online. The conference that was instituted in 2017 serves as a rallying point for gender equity in health.

“It is more difficult for women researchers to get their grants approved, significantly smaller portion of research grants go to women, and women also have difficulties in getting their results published if you are from developing countries in journals because of perceived biases. I have faced those kinds of challenges and biases,” Dr. Swaminathan said, adding that this is prevalent even today, where women have a tougher time defending their grant proposals because they are treated differently from male scientists.

Taking up on the theme of the conference, Dr. Swaminathan spoke of the inter-disciplinary approach she adopted as the DG, ICMR, including listening to nurses and not just doctors, as well as social workers, and strengthening the social and behavioural sciences as an element of medical research, and ensuring her staff were exposed to the concerns of the LGBTQI community.

The pandemic has brought to the fore several gaps in equal representation of women in decision-making in national and global bodies constituted to develop a response to health crises in general and COVID-19 in particular.

A study published in the British Medical Journal on October 1 and authored by Kim Robin Van Daalen, Csongor Bajnoczki and Maisoon Chowdhury, et al, highlights that while “women comprise 70% of the global health workforce, they hold only 25% of senior decision-making roles”. The study is titled, “Symptoms of a broken system: the gender gaps in COVID-19 decision making”.

The study analysed COVID-19 task forces and expert committees constituted by 87 countries and found that 85.2% of of 115 identified COVID-19 decision-making and expert task forces had mostly men as members, while a mere 3.5% of these bodies had gender parity. India too performs poorly — it was two women and 14 men in its COVID-19 Task Force, that is, a mere 14.3% of the members are women.

The study argues for a greater representation from the entire gender spectrum and not just male-female binaries, as well as across ethnic, racial, cultural, geographic and disability groups.

It also discusses the paradox presented by COVID-19 — that while women bear the worst brunt of the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic, they are also missing from policy bodies.

UN Women’s rapid assessment surveys in Asia Pacific to study the gender impact of COVID-19 shows that women in Bangladesh and Pakistan, are less likely to receive information about COVID-19 than men because of differences in cellphone ownership, Internet access and educational attainment. Women in Bangladesh had to wait longer to access health services and it is also more difficult to get medical supplies, hygiene products and food. In Nepal (65% women and 59% men), Bangladesh (83% women and 14% men) and Philippines (51% women and 34% men), a far greater number of women in formal sectors lost their jobs as compared to men.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lnu5ca/article32578294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WHO-SOUMYASWAMINATHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/our-institutions-are-very-patriarchal-who-chief-scientist-soumya-swaminathan/article32846728.ece
432,2020/10/13,Telescopes capture supermassive black hole devouring star,"When a star strays too close to a supermassive black hole, it is subjected to the phenomenal strength of the black hole's gravity

Astronomers have captured the moment a supermassive black hole shredded a star the size of our Sun, releasing images Monday showing the devastating process in unprecedented detail.

Using telescopes from the European Southern Observatory (ESO), they were able to monitor light flaring from the process — known as a tidal disruption event — from a black hole just over 215 million light years from Earth.

They observed the star being physically torn apart as it was sucked into the black hole's giant maw.

“The idea of a black hole ‘sucking in’ a nearby star sounds like science fiction,” said Matt Nicholl, a lecturer and Royal Astronomical Society research fellow at the University of Birmingham, lead author of Monday's study. “But that's exactly what happens in a tidal disruption event.”

When a star strays too close to a supermassive black hole, it is subjected to the phenomenal strength of the black hole's gravity. The star can be physically torn apart and its matter pulled into long strings, a process known as “spaghettification”.

“When these forces exceed the star's cohesive force, the star loses pieces that rush into the black hole,” Stephane Basa, a researcher from the Marseille Astrophysics Laboratory, told AFP. “This exceptional influx of matter produces intense electromagnetic emissions, which last for several months while the debris is digested.”

Basa said that around half of the star remained after the tidal disruption event. “‘Only’ half of its mass has disappeared,” he said. “That's already titanic.”

‘A monster’

While other tidal disruption events have previously been observed, the powerful burst of light they emit are often obscured by a curtain of dust and debris.

Because they discovered the event just a short time after the star was ripped apart the team were able to pinpoint how the obscuring debris forms.

Using high powered telescopes, they observed the event as the light flare grew in luminosity then gradually faded — a process of some six months.

Nicholl said that the observations suggested the star involved had roughly the mass as our own sun, but that the black hole was “a monster... which is over a million times more massive.”

The team behind the study, published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, said they hoped it would help scientists to better understand how matter behaves in the extreme gravity environments surrounding supermassive black holes.

Last week a trio of scientists, Roger Penrose of Britain, Reinhard Genzel of Germany and Andrea Ghez of the U.S., were awarded the Nobel Physics Prize for their research into black holes, dubbed by the Novel committee “one of the most exotic phenomena in the universe.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/hsreg0/article32842156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0008RR3HD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/telescopes-capture-supermassive-black-hole-devouring-star/article32842157.ece
433,2020/10/13,Unlock Fitness with Sugar Free without worrying about side-effects*,"2020 has seen the ‘new normal’ change every day and our body is no exception to that. During these last few months of lockdown what we have realized is that our fitness quotient has been thoroughly ignored. We have unconsciously become couch potatoes who eat everything & have lost a sense of control or discipline. While constantly snacking on unhealthy foods, our calorie-intake has increased alarmingly & this coupled with hardly any physical exercise has led to an increase in our weight. However, with India having now entered the unlock phase, it is of utmost importance that we also unlock fitness by ensuring that we maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle.

And while we act on our fitness by starting exercising or cutting down on oily food, one of the easiest ways to do so is to cut down on sugar consumption. Most of us feel that we hardly consume any sugar, but even the 2 cups of tea/coffee that we consume with sugar in it can have a big impact. For example, if you are adding 2 teaspoons of sugar in each cup of tea/coffee, & just have tea/coffee only twice daily, this will amount to approx. 80 calories from added sugar. You will need to walk for 2kms^ to burn off these calories consumed from sugar. Yes, 2kms! But cutting down sugar doesn’t mean you have to give up on the sweetness in your tea or coffee. Just replace your regular sugar with low-calorie sweeteners like Sugar Free. Low-calorie sweeteners like Sugar free provide the same sweetness of sugar without any calories.
