1,2020/10/23,Hyderabad residents cope with patchy internet as rains lash the city,"Several city residents took to Twitter to vent their ire about internet connectivity issues, flooding handles of broadband and mobile internet service providers.

A Deloitte employee Karan Kothari, 33, was midway through his (work from home) shift at 1 am on October 14 when a tree fell on the Hathway internet line near his house. He switched to his Vodafone Idea (Vi) mobile data service, which worked till 4.30 in the morning, and then stopped as there was no signal.

“Next day, I tried using Jio mobile internet for work, it was terribly slow, and I was out of options,” Kothari recalled. “I had to take a leave that day, as it was not possible to work with such slow internet connection,” he added.

Residents of Hyderabad have managed to stay connected with the world outside despite the heavy rains which have been lashing the city from past 15 days. While some struggled and resorted to slower alternatives, others have been more fortunate to get stable internet connectivity, barring a few minor glitches.

Srikar Raghavendra, 24, who is preparing for competitive exams after completing his graduation, generally spends a lot of time on the internet reading about various issues. “When the heavy rains started pounding the city, I was worried that broadband will get disconnected. But, except for a few interruptions, the internet worked fine,” he said. He is thankful to his local internet service provider as it helped him stay connected.

Several city residents took to Twitter to vent their ire about internet connectivity issues, flooding handles of broadband and mobile internet service providers like Hathway broadband, ACT Fibernet, Vodafone Idea, Airtel, and Jio, with tweets demanding immediate repair.

Vineesh Reddy, 23, a Master’s student at a U.S.-based university who is remotely connecting from Hyderabad said, “I only get Jio signal in my apartment and my online classes are held mostly late in the night or early in the mornings.”

He relies on a local internet service provider which ensures broadband connection for all the 60 flats in his apartment. However, since the rains began, service has been erratic. So, he had to use his Jio mobile internet, which was also not working properly. “Earlier, I used to watch HD movies using mobile data, now even WhatsApp images are taking time to open,” he added.

The Hindu tried contacting ACT Fibernet, Hathway and Jio, but could not get any response.

Vodafone Idea in an emailed response said, its network engineers worked round the clock to get the network up and running post the heavy rains and floods in the city.

There have been several lucky ones who did not face any major issue with their broadband connections. Two residents, Sandhya Rani and Akshita Teegalapally, residing in two ends of the city, in Bollarum and in Vidya Nagar near the OU campus, said they had some minor issues, which were promptly fixed by their internet service providers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/qpl666/article32931338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rain,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hyderabad-residents-cope-with-patchy-internet-as-rains-lash-the-city/article32931629.ece
2,2020/10/23,India smartphone market rebounds to record high in a single quarter,"The recent geopolitical rift between India and China did not impact the purchase decisions of mass market customers

Smartphone shipments in India rebounded to an all-time high in a single quarter as online sales surge.

The shipments jumped to 50 million units in the quarter ending September, growing 8% from the same period in the previous year, according to data from app intelligence firm Canalys. The shipments had shrunk in the last quarter ending June when it was a little over 15 million units.

Although shipments of almost all vendors increased, online channels had the most important role in the sales due to the festive season.

""Ongoing sales at Amazon and Flipkart are a clear indication that despite the economic downturn, India’s penchant for a good smartphone, and a good bargain, remains intact, ” said Adwait Mardikar, analyst at Canalys.

The Indian government’s reduced restrictions after a three-month lockdown has created the perfect atmosphere for sustained growth, Canalys noted.

It said that when India remains physically disconnected, the smartphone has become a necessity not only for social connection, but also for sectors like entertainment, education, banking and payment.

The recent geopolitical rift between India and China did not impact the purchase decisions of mass market customers, said Varun Kannan, analyst at Canalys.

Chinese brand, Xiaomi remained the market leader, shipping 13.1 million units, growing 9% compared with the previous year.

Samsung, Vivo, Realme and Oppo were the other players in the top five.

Chinese vendors contributed 76% of the total smartphone shipments this quarter, growing from 74% a year ago.

The Chinese smartphone brands have tried to project that they are all important stakeholders in the economic future of India, according to Canalys.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/5h3ivj/article32929829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mobilesrecordhigh,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/india-smartphone-market-rebounds-to-record-high-in-a-single-quarter/article32929768.ece
3,2020/10/23,Google’s new feature lets you create apps without coding,"Through the cloud’s no-code development platform, Google aims to eliminate the hassle of learning or finding someone to code, develop and fix an app.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Google has launched AppSheet to its Google Workspace interface, a feature that lets users create an app without having to write any code.

Through the cloud’s no-code development platform, Google aims to eliminate the hassle of learning or finding someone to code, develop and fix an app.

Users can create their own applications using AppSheet directly from Google Sheets. Simply open Sheet and look for ‘Open in AppSheet’ option under Tools.

Create an AppSheet account, start making an app and the AppSheet will manage the other parts -coding, analysing the data structure and creating a prototype app from it.

The data in the Sheet will serve as the source of data for the new application. AppSheet will automatically detect types of data connected, and will create an interface that is easy to use.

After a prototype is created, users can make modifications to their app with the options provided. It will then provide an option of installing the app on mobile and any future updates made to the app will be instantly reflected.

In addition to this, they can add dashboards to show real-time data, barcodes to scan items, and email workflows to receive automatic notifications.

AppSheet enables users to build all kinds of apps ranging from an app that manages customer orders to a safety app.

“There are plenty of possibilities to explore, especially since AppSheet integrates with other handy tools like Google Calendar, Maps and more,” Google said in a blog post.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/efybc4/article32929205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AppSheetpng,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/googles-new-feature-lets-you-create-apps-without-coding/article32929196.ece
4,2020/10/23,Facebook's Oversight Board open but unlikely to play role before U.S. election,"Global users can submit appeals through the board's website in the 15 days after Facebook contacts them about its final content decision, though this option will be gradually rolled out over the coming weeks.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Facebook Inc's independent Oversight Board, which can overrule company decisions on whether to take down posts and recommend policy changes, started accepting cases for review on Thursday.

The board, which the world's largest social network created in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, is open for cases both from users who have exhausted the company's appeals process and from Facebook itself.

However, Facebook has said the board is unlikely to handle cases related to the upcoming U.S. election, an event around which social media companies' content decisions are under scrutiny. Brent Harris, Facebook's director of governance and global affairs, told reporters on a call on Thursday that the company would not submit a case for expedited review before the Nov. 3 vote.

The board, a concept that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg first publicly floated in 2018, announced its first 20 members in May. They include a former prime minister, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and several law experts and rights advocates.

Global users can submit appeals through the board's website in the 15 days after Facebook contacts them about its final content decision, though this option will be gradually rolled out over the coming weeks.

A board spokesman told Reuters last month the coronavirus pandemic had contributed to delays since last year in launching the board.

The board, which will only be able to review a small slice of Facebook and Instagram content, said it would share details on its first cases in the coming weeks and open a public comment process. A maximum of 90 days is given for the board to reach case decisions and for Facebook to act on them.

Emi Palmor, an oversight board member and former director general of the Israeli Ministry of Justice, said in an interview that the board may recommend policy changes that would affect Facebook's features, and how the company distributes content or makes money from it.

“We are not concerned with Facebook as a company that wants to make money,” she said.

Palmor said the board needs to gain public trust in order to put pressure on Facebook to respect its policy recommendations as well as binding content decisions.

Facebook, which can refer cases on content left up or taken down on the site and on issues like ads or Facebook groups, began the process of selecting its cases for referral earlier this week, Harris said.

Palmor said the board, which is expected to grow to about 40 people, would also “immediately” start work to select its next members.

The board, which has been criticized for its limited scope, aims to be able to hear cases from users about content that has been left up, as well as taken down, starting in early 2021, the board's director of administration Thomas Hughes said.

In September Facebook critics, including the organizers of a social media advertising boycott, launched a rival group to review the company's content moderation, which they dubbed the ”Real Facebook Oversight Board.”

5,2020/10/23,"WhatsApp allows users to mute chats forever, offers in-app purchases","The company will also enter the cloud computing sector, offering firms who use its customer service messaging tools the ability to store those messages on Facebook servers.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

WhatsApp said on Friday its users can mute chats forever, and removed the one-year muting option from its list. Based on the new list, people can mute a conversation for 8 hours, a week or always, the messaging app said in a tweet.

Yesterday, the Facebook-owned company said it would start to offer in-app purchases and hosting services, as the social networking company moves to boost revenue from WhatsApp while knitting together e-commerce infrastructure across the company.

The world's biggest social media company has been trying to boost sales from higher-growth units such as Instagram and WhatsApp, which it bought in 2014 for $19 billion but has been slow to monetize.

With the changes, WhatsApp will enable businesses sell products inside WhatsApp via Facebook Shops, an online store launched in May to offer a unified shopping experience across Facebook's apps.

The company will also enter the cloud computing sector, offering firms who use its customer service messaging tools the ability to store those messages on Facebook servers.

WhatsApp's chief operating officer, Matt Idema, said in an interview that the shopping tool would start rolling out this year, while message hosting would become available in 2021.

Idema said WhatsApp would offer the hosting service for free to try to draw new paying customers to its enterprise tools, which charge 0.5 cents to 9 cents per message delivered.

The app has a relatively small customer base of tens of thousands of businesses, while tens of millions use its more limited free tools aimed at small businesses.

In total, more than 175 million people interact with a business each day on WhatsApp, Idema said.

“The revenue is small today, by comparison to Facebook at large, but we think the opportunity is pretty big,” he said.

Idema said chats with a business using the new hosting service will disclose that those conversations are stored elsewhere and not protected by the app's end-to-end encryption.

Facebook would not use message data hosted on its servers for other business purposes, he added.

7,2020/10/23,Israel and Sudan reach U.S.-brokered deal to normalize ties,"This makes Khartoum the third Arab government to set aside hostilities with Israel in the last two months

Israel and Sudan agreed on Friday to take steps to normalize relations in a deal brokered with the help of the United States, making Khartoum the third Arab government to set aside hostilities with Israel in the last two months.

U.S. President Donald Trump, seeking re-election on November. 3, sealed the agreement in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and Transitional Council Head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, senior U.S. officials said.

Mr. Trump's decision this week to remove Sudan from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism paved the way for the accord with Israel, marking a foreign policy achievement for the Republican president as he seeks a second term trailing in opinion polls behind Democratic rival Joe Biden.

“The leaders agreed to the normalization of relations between Sudan and Israel and to end the state of belligerence between their nations,” according to a joint statement issued by the three countries.

Israel and Sudan plan to begin by opening economic and trade relations, with an initial focus on agriculture, the joint statement said. A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such issues as formal establishment of diplomatic ties would be resolved later.

Mr. Trump touted the deal to reporters in the Oval Office with the Israeli and Sudanese leaders on the line in a three-way phone call, saying at least five other countries want to follow suit and normalize relations with Israel.

“Do you think 'Sleepy Joe' could have made this deal?” Mr. Trump asked Mr. Netanyahu, using the president's pejorative nickname for Biden a day after their final, rancorous debate of the 2020 presidential campaign.

Mr. Netanyahu, reliant on bipartisan support for Israel in Washington, responded: Uh... one thing I can tell you is we appreciate the help for peace from anyone in America.

Mr. Trump's aides view his pro-Israel policies as appealing to Christian evangelical voters, who are among his biggest supporters.

Mr. Trump insisted the Palestinians also “are wanting to do something” but offered no proof. Palestinian leaders have condemned recent Arab diplomatic outreach to Israel as a betrayal of their nationalist cause and have refused to engage with the Trump administration, seeing it as heavily biased in favor of Israel.

A senior Palestinian Liberation Organization official described Sudan's decision to take steps to normalize relations with Israel as a “new stab in the back” for the Palestinians.

Mr. Trump announced on Monday he would take Sudan off the terrorism list once it had deposited $335 million it had pledged to pay in compensation. Khartoum has since placed the funds in a special escrow account for victims of al-Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

Shortly before the Israel-Sudan deal was announced, Mr. Trump notified Congress of “his intent to formally rescind Sudans designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.” The White House called the move a “pivotal turning point” for Khartoum, which is seeking to emerge from decades of isolation.

Mr. Trump's aides have been pressing Sudan to take steps toward normalizing relations with Israel, following similar U.S.-brokered moves in recent weeks by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.

A sticking point in the negotiations was Sudan's insistence that any announcement of Khartoum's delisting from the terrorism designation not be explicitly linked to establishing ties with Israel.

The military and civilian leaders of Sudan's transitional government have been divided over how fast and how far to go in establishing ties with Israel.

The Sudanese premier wants approval from a yet-to-be formed parliament to proceed with broader normalization, and that may not be a quick progress given sensitivities and civilian-military differences.

The agreement was negotiated on the U.S. side by Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz, national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security aide Miguel Correa.

Mr. Kushner called the normalization deals the start of a ”paradigm shift” in the Middle East. He said Sudan's decision was symbolically significant because it was in Khartoum in 1967 that the Arab League decided not to recognize Israel's right to exist.

Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism dates to its toppled ruler Omar al-Bashir and has made it difficult for its transitional government to access urgently needed debt relief and foreign financing.

Many in Sudan say the designation, imposed in 1993 because Washington believed Bashir was supporting militant groups, has become outdated since he was removed last year.

8,2020/10/23,"On Korean War anniversary, Xi sends warning to ‘invaders’","‘China will never allow any force to invade the motherland’

China’s President Xi Jinping on Friday invoked the memory of the Korean War on its 70th anniversary to send a warning to any “invaders” that “force must be met with force”.

Mr. Xi, speaking at a meeting to mark the anniversary of what China officially calls “the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea”, said the 1950-53 conflict that saw China intervene on behalf of North Korea served a reminder that China “will never sit back and watch any damage to our national sovereignty” and “will never allow any force to invade or divide the sacred territory of the motherland.”

While the Chinese President did not specifically refer to any of China’s current disputes, Chinese State media have framed the high-profile marking of the anniversary through a number of events in recent days, against the backdrop of deteriorating China-U.S. relations and as sending a message to Washington, even if Mr. Xi’s comments would likely also draw attention in both India and Taiwan amid recent tensions.

“It is necessary to speak to invaders in the language they know, that is, a war must be fought to deter invasion, and force must be met by force,” he was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency. “A victory is needed to win peace and respect.”

A ‘mistake’ to have walked out of Quad, Malabar exercise in 2008: Australian envoy Barry O’Farrell

He said “the Chinese nation will never cower before threats, or be subdued by suppression” and called for “fostering the valour of the nation that fears no death” and “the need to promote the national wisdom of keeping to the right path, making innovations, and striving to march forward”.

Taking aim at the Quad

On Friday, the official news agency released a commentary criticising the U.S. in the wake of Australia joining the India-U.S.-Japan Malabar naval exercise set for next month, describing the four-member “Quad” grouping as “a clique flexing muscles in the Asian-Pacific region” and saying the “regional situation should be taken into account when a drill is schemed and the motivation behind it explored”.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday issued a somewhat muted response to the announcement of the exercise, saying China “always believe[s] that military cooperation between countries should be conducive to regional peace and stability.”

The Xinhua commentary issued a sharper response. “After a long-time hiatus, the Quad reconvened in 2017 when the United States proposed the so-called Indo-Pacific strategy on the East Asia cooperation, which, based on an obsolete Cold War mentality, is aimed at stoking geopolitical competition and confrontation so as to contain the region’s development,” it said.

‘Cold War mentality’

The drill, the commentary said, was “a sign that the bloc is mulling military and security cooperation for self-serving political interests”. “The Cold War mentality is as poisonous as history has proven,” it added.

“Asia-Pacific countries should jointly resist such a detrimental mentality and team up to promote peace and development for their own good. Some countries’ attempts to advocate a Cold War mentality and create chaos in the region will only shoot themselves in the foot.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/m2nglk/article32932919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-TOPSHOT-CHINA-CONFLICT-ANNIVERSARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/on-korean-war-anniversary-xi-sends-warning-to-invaders/article32932920.ece
9,2020/10/23,Libya’s warring factions agree to ‘permanent’ truce,"Foreign fighters to quit in three months; more talks in Tunisia.

Libya’s warring factions signed a permanent ceasefire agreement on Friday, but any lasting end to years of chaos and bloodshed will require wider agreement among myriad armed groups and the outside powers that support them.

Acting United Nations envoy Stephanie Williams said the ceasefire would start immediately and all foreign fighters must leave Libya within three months. Forces would withdraw from front lines and a new joint police force would secure those areas.

As a first commercial passenger flight in more than a year crossed front lines from Tripoli to the eastern city of Benghazi on Friday, Ms. Williams noted Libya’s “fraught” recent history, one of numerous broken truces and failed political solutions.

“But we shouldn’t let the cynics win,” she said, hailing both sides for their “courage” in agreeing a ceasefire and saying they deserved international support.

Friday’s agreement was reached after the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in June beat back Khalifa Haftar’s eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) from its 14-month assault on the capital.

Since then, frontlines have stabilised near the central coastal city of Sirte and the LNA ended its eight-month blockade of Libyan oil output that was strangling state finances on both sides.

However, Turkey, the main backer of the GNA, immediately voiced scepticism that the ceasefire would hold, with President Tayyip Erdogan saying “it does not seem too achievable”.

Turkey, along with the LNA’s main foreign backers Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, has funnelled weapons and fighters into Libya despite a U.N. arms embargo which they all publicly backed.

There was caution inside Libya too. “We all want to end the war and destruction. But personally I don’t trust those in power,” said Kamal al-Mazoughi, 53, a businessman sitting in a Tripoli cafe.

“If there is no force or mechanism to apply this on the ground... this deal will only be ink on paper,” said Ahmed Ali, 47, in Benghazi.

Key details on implementing the ceasefire, including monitoring the departure of foreign fighters and merging armed groups, has been left to subcommittees in future talks.

Both sides have deployed thousands of foreign fighters in Libya, including Syrians, Sudanese, Chadians and European mercenaries brought in by Russia’s Wagner group. Since June they have also entrenched along the Sirte frontlines with new weapons and defensive positions.

More talks in Tunisia

Meanwhile, political talks scheduled in Tunisia early next month with an eventual view towards holding national elections, would need to reach agreement on historically elusive issues and overcome widespread mistrust.

“There is still no clear sign that Libyan belligerents are looking at this as anything other than a period of posturing and positioning,” said Tarek Megerisi, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Libya has enjoyed no political stability since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising against Muammar Gaddafi and has been split since 2014 between east and west.

Haftar’s assault on Tripoli last year was launched as U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres had arrived in Tripoli to prepare for peace talks.

As that assault collapsed this summer thanks to Turkish backing for the GNA, Egypt threatened to directly intervene, raising the spectre of a bloody regional escalation.

It put Libya’s energy facilities, the biggest prize for both sides in the OPEC member state, on the front line as mercenaries marched into ports and oilfields.

However, the United Nations is also pushing an economic track in the talks to seek agreement between the major factions on the future management of Libya’s wealth and its sovereign institutions.

“What prevails among (Libyan factions) is a desire to re-start the economy,” said Jalel Harchaoui, an analyst working on Libya. “That alignment is frail and temporary,” he warned.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/libyas-warring-factions-agree-to-permanent-truce/article32932843.ece
10,2020/10/23,Israel jets strike Gaza,"Earlier, Palestinian militants fired two rockets into Israel.

The Israeli military said on Friday it launched overnight airstrikes in the Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants fired two rockets, with no reports of casualties or major damage on either side.

The military said fighter jets and other aircraft struck a weapons manufacturing site and “underground infrastructure” belonging to the Islamic militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza.

11,2020/10/23,Donald Trump’s remark on ‘filthy’ Indian air sparks row,"U.S. President clubs India with China, Russia for inaction over climate protection

Speaking during his second and final presidential debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, U.S. President Donald Trump called India “filthy” and clubbed it with Russia and China — both considered U.S. rivals. The President’s comments were made in the context of the U.S.’s (former) emission commitments under the Paris Climate Accord — Mr. Trump had withdrawn the country from the agreement on the grounds that it was unfair towards America.

“And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we’ve had in 35 years under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but here’s what we can’t do: look at China, how filthy it is, look at Russia, look at India, it’s filthy, the air is filthy,” Mr Trump said responding to a question on how he would combat climate change and support job growth.

“The Paris Accord… I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly,” he added.

Mr. Trump has previously compared the U.S. to India and China (and sometimes Russia) in the same breath, for instance in the multilateral climate change context or in the context of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which, according to Mr. Trump, has treated the U.S. unfairly. More recently his comparisons have been on the amount of known coronavirus cases versus the amount of testing and how the U.S. is testing far more than other countries, including India.

The language used on Thursday, however, was stronger than normal and comes a few days before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper are scheduled to travel in New Delhi to meet their counterparts for the U.S.-India 2+2 ministerial. They are also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Mr. Trump’s comments predictable sparked strong reactions on social media: from the impact of the remarks on Indian American voters — a constituency both Republicans and Democrats are courting — to some users saying Mr. Trump was speaking the truth and that the air in Indian cities was indeed bad and there was “no point being outraged” by his words. One politician challenged Mr. Modi to respond to Mr Trump.

12,2020/10/23,France to crack down on social media,"Once voted into law, the provision will allow “the punishment of those who post personal information, thus threatening the life of a person, for example a teacher”, Prime Minister Castex said.

France said on Friday it would crack down on social media posts that put people in danger by divulging their personal details, a week after the murder of a teacher targeted in an online campaign over Prophet Mohammed cartoons.

In the run-up to the murder, the parent of one of Samuel Paty’s students and a known Islamist radical had run a social media campaign against the teacher.

French Prime Minister Jean Castex said a pending draft law defending secular values against radical Islam — known as an anti-separatism law — would now be amended to allow the prosecution of anybody who posts personal details online if this “threatens the life of another”.

13,2020/10/23,French teacher’s killer had ‘contact’ with jihadist in Syria,"Audio clip contains references to the Islamic State group.

The investigation into the murder of a French teacher for showing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in class turned to Syria on Thursday, where the killer had a jihadist contact, a source close to the case said.

Seven people have been charged with being complicit in a “terrorist murder” after 18-year-old Chechen Abdullakh Anzorov beheaded Samuel Paty on the outskirts of Paris on Friday, including two teenagers who helped him identify the teacher.

Emmanuel Macron promises more pressure on Islamist extremism

France paid homage to Paty on Wednesday, with President Emmanuel Macron saying that the history and geography teacher had been slain by “cowards” for representing the secular, democratic values of the French Republic.

“Islamists want to take our future,” Mr. Macron said. “They will never have it.”

In their search for accomplices, anti-terror investigators have now established that Anzorov had contact with a Russian-speaking jihadist in Syria whose identity is not yet known, the source told AFP.

Traced to Idlib

Le Parisien newspaper reported on Thursday that Anzorov’s suspected contact had been located through an IP address traced back to Idlib, a jihadist holdout in northwestern Syria.

In an audio message in Russian immediately after the killing, translated by AFP, Anzorov said that he had “avenged the Prophet” whom the teacher had shown “in an insulting way”.

In the recording, which contains several references to the Koran as well as to the Islamic State group, he also said: “Brothers, pray that Allah accepts me as a martyr.”

The message was published on social media in a video, accompanied by two tweets, one showing the victim’s severed head and another in which Anzorov confessed to the murder.

Moments later, he was shot dead by the police.

Many of Paty’s students saw the images online before they could be taken down.

Britain and Japan formally signed a trade agreement on Friday, marking Britain’s first big post-Brexit deal on trade, as it continues to struggle to agree on a deal with its closest trading partners in the European Union.

15,2020/10/23,FATF keeps Pakistan on grey list till next review in February 2021,"Pakistan failed to deliver on action against organisations linked to terror groups banned by the UN Security Council, and delays in prosecution of banned individuals and entities like Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed and LeT operations chief Zaki Ur Rahman Lakhvi as well as Jaish-e- Mohammad chief Masood Azhar.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Friday decided to keep Pakistan on the “greylist” till the next review of its compliance to the recommendations in February next year.

“Pakistan has made progress across all action plan items and has now largely addressed 21 of 27 action items. As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February 2021,” said an FATF statement issued in Paris at the end of the Plenary session, on the decision to keep Pakistan in the list of ""Jurisdictions under increased monitoring"" or greylist.

At the FATF Plenary, sources said, Turkey proposed that the members should consider Pakistan’s good work and instead of waiting for completion of the remaining six of the 27 parameters, an FATF on-site team should visit Pakistan to finalise its assessment.

On-site teams are permitted only after jurisdictions complete their Action Plans. Normally such a visit is a signal for exit from the grey or black list. When the proposal was placed before the 38-member Plenary, no other member seconded the move. It was not supported by even China, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, according to the sources.

The FATF finally decided to keep Pakistan in the “greylist”, as was earlier reported by The Hindu. Pakistan has now almost four months to comply with the recommendations as its performance will now be put to scrutiny in the next Plenary in February 2021.

The points on which Pakistan failed to deliver included its lack of action against the charitable organisations or non-profit organisations linked to the terror groups banned by the UN Security Council; and delays in the prosecution of banned individuals and entities like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) chief Hafiz Saeed and LeT operations chief, Zaki Ur Rahman Lakhvi, as well as Jaish-e- Mohammad chief Masood Azhar.

While Saeed was sentenced in February this year to 11 years in prison for terror financing, and he remains behind bars, the Pakistan government claims the others are “untraceable”. Queries have been raised on each of the missing persons and about the efforts made to trace them.

The FATF has also noted that there were few convictions of terror commanders of UN-designated entities affiliated to the Al Qaeda and the Haqqani network. Pakistan was found non-compliant in cracking down on terror financing through narcotics and smuggling of mining products including precious stones.

The FATF process also showed concern about the 4,000 names that were on Pakistan’s Schedule-IV list under the Anti-Terrorism Act up to January, but went missing in September 2020. Pakistan has been asked as to how this happened.

The FATF “greylist” refers to countries that are “monitored jurisdictions”, while the “blacklist” refers to those facing a “call to action” or severe banking strictures, sanctions and difficulties in accessing loans.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/aw60dy/article32931197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MarcusPleyerFATFjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/terror-financing-watchdog-fatf-keeps-pakistan-on-greylist-till-next-review-in-february-2021/article32931451.ece
16,2020/10/23,"Coronavirus | Actual tally of COVID-19 in Spain likely over 3 million, says PM Pedro Sanchez","Pedro Sanchez said that more needed to be done to combat the COVID-19 pandemic but he stopped short of announcing new measures.

Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Friday that more needed to be done to combat the COVID-19 pandemic but he stopped short of announcing new measures and instead called on citizens to act responsibly.

With Spain's COVID-19 cases soaring this week to total over a million — the highest in Western Europe — the government has said the pandemic was out of control.

But it lacks the majority in parliament to push bold steps and override sometimes reluctant regions who decide on health matters.

“If we don't follow precautions, we are putting the lives of those we love most at risk,” Mr. Sanchez said in a televised address to the nation. “What we have to do is reduce mobility and social contact. There is no other solution.”

Earlier on Friday, the region of Castilla and Leon had urged the central government to impose nationwide night-time curfews quickly. Most other regions are also in favour of some form of curfew, but the powerful Madrid and Basque country authorities opposed such a move.

It will be up to each region to say what they want to do next but they do not have the authority to impose curfews without a decision at national level.

A record 20,986 COVID-19 cases were added in Spain on Thursday, bringing the official total to 1,026,281.

But Sanchez said that, since not all cases are detected, the actually tally was likely over 3 million.

European Union environment ministers struck a deal on Friday to make the bloc’s 2050 net zero emissions target legally binding, but left a decision on a 2030 emissions-cutting target for leaders to discuss in December.

The landmark climate change law will form the basis for Europe’s plan to slash greenhouse gas emissions, which will reshape all sectors, from transport to heavy industry, and require hundreds of billions of euros in annual investments.

It will fix in law the EU target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and define the rules for reviewing progress towards climate targets.

Ministers struck a deal on these parts of the law at a meeting in Luxembourg on Friday. None of the 27 member countries rejected the bill, although Bulgaria abstained.

A decision on the most politically sensitive part of the bill - a new 2030 emissions-cutting target - was left for EU leaders to agree, unanimously, at a December meeting.

The law will give Brussels “the legal possibility to act when those who make promises don’t deliver on the promises,” said EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans at Friday’s meeting. It was held in person, despite much of the continent restricting gatherings to curb surging coronavirus infections.

Ministers agreed to make the 2050 net zero emissions target an EU-wide goal, rather than a requirement for individual countries, potentially letting some have higher emissions if others make deeper cuts.

19,2020/10/23,China may not recognise British-issued Hong Kong passports,"Ministry spokesperson says Britain had violated its promises and played up the issue of the British National (Overseas) passports.

China’s foreign ministry said on Friday that it may decide not to recognise British-issued passports for Hong Kong residents in retaliation for London’s moves to open a path to citizenship for those holding the documents.

Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that Britain had violated its promises and played up the issue of the British National (Overseas) passports.

Britain said in May that it would allow holders of such passports extended stays and the possibility of citizenship, prompting thousands of Hong Kongers to rush to renew or apply for them as Beijing steps up restriction on political expression.

Hong Kong reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997 and the sides have increasingly feuded over civil rights in the territory. Britain accuses China of failing to live up to its pledges to maintain freedoms in the special administrative region, while Beijing says London is interfering in its internal affairs.

Differences have sharpened since China in June imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong in response to months of anti-government protests last year. London suspended its extradition treaty with the territory and has offered political asylum to persons targeted under the new legislation.

“The British side violated its promises, insisted on going its own way and repeatedly played up the issue of BNO Passports,”Mr. Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.

“As the British side violated its commitment first, China will consider not recognizing the BNO Passport as a valid travel document, and reserves the right to take further measures,” Mr. Zhao said.

More than 3,00,000 of Hong Kong’s 7 million residents hold BNO passports, according to the U.K., more than double the number four years earlier. Those who qualify can apply for visas enabling them and their immediate family members to live and work in the U.K. and eventually apply for citizenship, the British government says.

The UN chief says it’s very frustrating that leaders of the 20 major industrialized nations didn’t come together in March and establish a coordinated response to grapple with the coronavirus in all countries as he proposed.

21,2020/10/23,Nawaz Sharif charged with fresh graft case,"The case was approved against Mr. Sharif and other officials for illegally purchasing 73 high-security vehicles for the security of foreign dignitaries.

Pakistan’s anti-corruption body has slapped a fresh corruption case on deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, compounding the legal woes of the embattled Opposition leader who has frequently attacked the powerful military as well as the government.

Sharif, the 70-year-old supremo of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) who was ousted from power in 2017 by the Supreme Court on corruption charges, is currently in London for medical treatment.

The National Accountability Bureau also approved cases against Mr. Sharif’s ex-personal secretary Fawad Hasan Fawad, former federal minister Ahsan Iqbal, former foreign secretary Aizaz Chaudhry and former Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief Aftab Sultan, Dawn newspaper reported.

On Thursday, a total of 11 cases were approved at NAB’s Executive Board Meeting (EBM) presided over by its chairman, retired Justice Javed Iqbal.

According to the NAB, a fresh case was approved against Mr. Sharif along with Mr. Chaudhry, Mr. Sultan and Mr. Fawad for illegally purchasing 73 high-security vehicles for the security of foreign dignitaries.

They are accused of favouritism and illegal use of vehicles, causing huge financial loss to the national exchequer.

The EBM also approved a case against Ahsan Iqbal and Mohammad Ahmed, contractor/owner of private firm Ahmed and Sons, for increasing the scope of the Sports City project in Narowal from Rs 30 million to Rs 3 billion by abusing the authority .

They are accused of illegally providing the funds of the federal government to provincial government projects after the 18th Amendment by using personal influence, which inflicted huge losses on the national exchequer.

The case against Mr. Iqbal was approved two days after he had said in a private TV talk show that the NAB had been investigating the Narowal Sports City case against him for the last two-and-a-half years but did not file a reference.

Mr. Sharif is already facing several cases of corruption and misuse of authority which he has declared as a result of political vendetta by the current government led by Prime Minister Khan.

The approval of fresh cases followed a recent speech by Prime Minister Khan that the Opposition would see a different Imran Khan , which was interpreted as a threat to arrest more opposition leaders and court cases.

Apart from Mr. Sharif and his close aides, the NAB approved cases worth billions of rupees of alleged corruption against several officials and businessmen for causing losses to the country in different projects.

Mr. Sharif criticised the military establishment in recent speeches at gatherings of the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement.

Days before the July 2018 general elections, Mr. Sharif was convicted in the Avenfield properties case and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His daughter Maryam was sentenced to seven years in prison for abetment and his son-in-law Captain (retd) Mohammad Safdar to one year.

In December 2018, anti-corruption court judge Arshad Malik convicted Mr. Sharif in Al-Azizia Steel Mills case and sentenced him to seven years in prison. Judge Malik was later dismissed from service over misconduct.

The IHC later granted bail to Mr, Sharif, Ms. Maryam and Safdar. Mr. Sharif, after his conviction in the Al-Azizia case, was sent to jail but released for eight weeks on medical grounds. The bail-granting order lapsed while the former premier was in London.

The IHC had in September fixed the appeals against conviction of Mr. Sharif in Al-Azizia and Avenfield cases. After hearing the pleas, the court rejected Mr. Sharif’s applications seeking hearing in absentia and issued his non-bailable arrest warrants.

The court then issued his proclamation giving the former premier final opportunity to join the proceeding before confiscating his properties.

Separately, an accountability court in Islamabad has already confiscated movable and immovable properties of Ms. Sharif because he absconded in the Toshakhana case, which is about alleged corruption in purchase of vehicles.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/au12ym/article30478012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NAWAZSHARIF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nawaz-sharif-charged-with-fresh-graft-case/article32928586.ece

23,2020/10/23,Australian police not investigating Vatican money transfer,"Media speculation in Italy suggest that the movie might be linked to the overturning of convictions of Cardinal George Pell.

Australian state police said on Friday they’re not investigating the transfer of money from the Vatican to Australia, throwing doubt on Italian media speculation that it might be linked to the overturned convictions of Cardinal George Pell for child sex abuse.

Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera speculated in recent weeks that Vatican investigators were looking into whether Pell’s nemesis at the Holy See, ousted Cardinal Angelo Becciu, wired 700,000 euros ($823,000) in Vatican money to a bank account in Australia, and whether that money was tied to Pell’s sex abuse trial.

Victoria Police, which in 2017 charged Pell with child sex abuse, said the Australian intelligence agency responsible for detecting international financial crime, AUSTRAC, had confirmed that Vatican money had been wired to Australia.

But AUSTRAC had not advised Victoria Police of any suspicious activity related to these transactions, the police department said.

In the absence of any other evidence or intelligence, Victoria Police has noted the advice from AUSTRAC. We are not at this time conducting any further investigation, a police statement said.

But it does not rule out criminality or corruption in the money transfers.

Australian Federal Police said on Wednesday it was undertaking a review of the relevant information provided by AUSTRAC. A review of evidence is a preliminary step toward an official criminal investigation.

Federal Police has also referred information to the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, an anti-graft agency that investigates the state public sector, including police.

The commission has declined comment for legal and operational reasons. The Italian newspaper speculated that Becciu might have bought the testimony of Pell’s accuser to get Pell out of the Vatican. Becciu and Pell were known to have clashed over Pell’s financial clean-up efforts at the Holy See. Pell’s accuser, who cannot be identified, has denied the allegation.

The newspaper report had no sourcing, attributions or detail and appeared to be more an effort to discredit Becciu and distract attention from the shortcomings of the Vatican prosecutors’ primary investigation into a London real estate venture.

The Australian newspaper reported on Thursday that Vatican investigators were examining four transfers to Australia between February 2017 and June 2018 of more than 1,050,000 euros ($1.24 million). The newspaper cited no sources.

Pell was convicted by a Victoria court jury in 2018 on allegations he molested two choirboys in St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne while he was archbishop in the 1990s, but was ultimately absolved by Australia’s High Court.

Pell was brought in by Pope Francis to bring accountability and transparency to the Vatican’s opaque finances in 2014.

He returned to the Vatican this month for a meeting with Pope Francis and to clear out his apartment after Becciu was fired over allegations that he wired 100,000 euros ($118,000) in Vatican funds to a charity headed by his brother. Becciu has denied wrongdoing.

Becciu has repeatedly denied involvement in Pell’s conviction.

24,2020/10/23,11 Indian students arrested for trying to illegally remain in U.S.,"These students were arrested from various locations in Boston, Washington, Houston, Ft. Lauderdale, Newark, Nashville, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg.

Federal law enforcement agencies have arrested 15 students, including 11 from India, on charges of fraudulently staying inside the country.

These students were arrested on Wednesday from various locations in Boston, Washington, Houston, Ft. Lauderdale, Newark, Nashville, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg. In addition to 11 Indian nationals, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also arrested two Libyans, one Senegalese and one Bangladeshi national.

According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, the arrests were made as a result of Operation OPTical Illusion, a law enforcement operation targeting non-immigrant students who fraudulently used the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program to remain in the U.S.

OPT enables non-immigrant students to work in the U.S. in positions related to their field of study for up to one year, with an additional 24 months if the student participates in STEM optional practical training.

ICE said these students claimed to be employed by companies that do not exist.

“This is just another example of the Trump Administration not only putting America first but making sure the laws of the immigration system are enforced,” said Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli.

“Every instance of fraud is a job an American worker could have had, and with so many Americans looking for work this crime is even more unacceptable,” he said.

“ICE has a system of checks in place to mitigate fraud and is committed to protecting national security by ensuring that students, visitors, and schools comply with U.S. immigration laws,” said ICE Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director Tony Pham.

“These latest arrests demonstrate that the agency is actively targeting individuals who try to exploit the student visa system,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/11-indian-students-arrested-for-trying-to-illegally-remain-in-us/article32925941.ece

Mr. Motegi pointed out that the signing came about in just four and a half months since the start of negotiations and said, ”This is a manifestation of the determination of Japan and the United Kingdom to carry on vigorously promoting free trade”.

Britain has said the deal meant 99% of its exports to Japan would be tariff-free, and that it could increase trade by 15.2 billion pounds ($19.9 billion) in the long run, compared with 2018.

The deal removes Britain's tariffs on Japanese cars in stages to zero in 2026, which is the same as in the Japan-EU trade agreement.

Mr. Motegi said after the signing that he had agreed with Truss to work together so that the deal will come into force on January 1, 2021.

He also said Japan welcomes Britain's interest in joining the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) free trade deal, and intends to provide necessary support.

Japan is already a member of the CPTPP, which also links Canada, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.

26,2020/10/23,Joe Biden says he would push for $15 minimum wage,"The current minimum wage at the U.S. is $7.25 an hour.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would push for a $15-per-hour minimum wage and rejected the idea that it would hurt small businesses. He was responding to a question on where he stands on raising the federal minimum wage as part of the final U.S. presidential debate on Thursday night.

“There is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business,” said the former Vice President.

President Donald Trump argued that the minimum wage should be left as an issue for the states to determine.

“How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages? What’s going to happen, and what’s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees,” he said.

The minimum wage is now $7.25 an hour.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday accused China, India and Russia of not taking care of their filthy air as he justified America’s withdrawal from the landmark Paris climate agreement.

“Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. The air is filthy,” Mr. Trump said during the final presidential debate with his Democratic challenger Joe Biden in Nashville, Tennessee.

“I walked out of the Paris Accord as we had to take out trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly,” he said in response to a question on climate change.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly blamed countries like India and China for not doing enough on climate change, labelling them as regions with air that is impossible to breathe.

In 2017, Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, saying the international deal to keep global temperatures rise below 2 degree Celsius was disadvantageous to U.S. workers.

He has continuously argued that countries like China and India are benefiting the most from the Paris agreement.

Speaking to his cheering supporters at an elections rally in the key battleground State of North Carolina last week, Mr. Trump had blamed countries like China, Russia and India for adding to the global air pollution.

“We have the best environmental numbers, ozone numbers, and so many other numbers. In the meantime, China, Russia, India all these countries they’re spewing stuff into the air,” he alleged during the rally.

28,2020/10/23,Parents not found for 545 children separated by U.S. border policy,"A court filing in the case said some parents deported without their children could not yet be located.

Lawyers and non-profit organisations seeking to reunite immigrant families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border by the Trump administration have not been able to locate the parents of 545 children so far.

A federal judge ordered thousands of families separated at the border in 2017 and 2018 to be reunited after a 2018 lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

A court filing in the case this week said some parents deported without their children could not yet be located.

“Arduous on-the-ground searches” for parents deported to their countries of origin — many in Central America — have been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the filing said.

Republican U.S. President Donald Trump in May 2018 implemented a controversial “zero tolerance” policy to prosecute families caught crossing the border illegally and remove their children. Amid international outcry, Mr. Trump ended the policy just months after it was announced.

Overall, the government has identified more than 4,200 children who could fall under Judge Dana Sabraw's reunification order.

A committee formed to locate family members focused on trying to reach families of children for whom the government provided phone numbers for a sponsor or parent. But as of October 20, parents of 545 children could not be reached, the filing in U.S. District Court in San Diego said.

“We've contacted these families and the sad truth is that many of them have declined to accept their children back,” White House spokesperson Brian Morgenstern told reporters on Wednesday, not addressing the assertion that hundreds of parents could not be reached.

Mr. Trump's Democratic challenger in the Nov. 3 presidential election, former Vice President Joe Biden, called the news “an outrage.”

29,2020/10/23,"COVID-19 to push 150-175 million more people into extreme poverty, says UN expert","Most of those who will fall into extreme poverty will be workers in the informal sector or in precarious employment conditions — most of them women.

Between 150 million and 175 million more people will fall into extreme poverty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an expert said at the UN.

Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights Olivier De Schutter said that between 150 million and 175 million more people will fall into extreme poverty, due to the epic fallout from COVID-19.

Mr. Schutter told the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) on Wednesday as delegates raised concerns about the plight of the world’s most vulnerable in a series of interactive dialogues.

“We must rethink our development model,” Mr. De Schutter said, adding that most of those who will fall into extreme poverty will be workers in the informal sector or in precarious employment conditions — most of them women.

In order to emerge from the worst crisis since the 1929 Great Depression, “we cannot count, as we did in the 20th century, on economic growth as usual,” he said.

Environmental sustainability and social justice must be considered prerequisites for shaping the economic recovery that countries envision, he said.

Mr. De Schutter was one of five independent experts participating in virtual dialogues with delegates, which covered topics ranging from extreme poverty and internal displacement, to the human rights to education, safe drinking water and adequate housing.

Experts described the interplay between conflict and climate change, and recommended ways to ensure that students can access water and sanitation in school during the pandemic.

Cecilia Jimenez-Damary, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, said the intersecting risks of climate change and armed conflict can push people into displacement. She focused on the slow-onset effects of climate change — sea-level rise, desertification, glacial retreat and flood — which can have disastrous consequences.

Most affected will be people whose livelihoods depend heavily on ecosystems: indigenous peoples, farmers, herders, pastoralists and fisherfolk.

Displaced persons also risk being exposed to COVID-19, due to their limited access to health care, water, sanitation and adequate housing, Ms. Jimenez-Damary said, according to information on the UN website.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gm0hp/article32906592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POVERTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-to-push-150-175-mn-more-people-into-extreme-poverty-un-expert/article32924787.ece
30,2020/10/23,"Final presidential debate: Donald Trump, Joe Biden discuss contrasting realities and plans","U.S. President Donald Trump defends his approach to the coronavirus outbreak and claims the worst of the pandemic was in the past.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden came face to face for their final debate before Election Day. The candidates, who debated at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, sparred on topics that included the pandemic, climate change, China and corruption.

The debate was markedly less chaotic than the first debate — possibly due, in part, to the muting of microphones during segments of each candidate’s response; Mr Trump did not interrupt Mr Biden as he did in the first debate allowing for a clearer presentation of both sides’ positions.

The response to the pandemic and how each candidate would lead the country out of it was discussed at length, with Mr Biden warning that the country was heading into a “dark winter.”

“Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president,” Mr Biden said.

As president he would encourage everyone to wear masks, introduce rapid testing, institute national standards for schools and businesses to open up and give them financial assistance to spend on safety measures, he said.

“All he does is talk about shutdowns,” Mr Trump said.” No, we’re not going to shut down and we have to open our schools.”

Mr Trump said that the shutdown had caused depression, job loss, suicide, alcohol and drug use as well as abuse. He said 2.2 million were expected to die — a misleading statement based on a White House disease model scenario if no person took any action to curtail infections. Mr Trump insisted again, that the country was “rounding the turn” [turning the corner] on the pandemic.

To Mr Trump’s “We’re learning to live with” the pandemic, Mr Biden said, “We are learning to die with it.”

When moderator Kristen Welker of NBC asked Mr Trump if he could guarantee that a vaccine would be out in weeks he said no, but said there was a “good chance” it would be available that soon.

“No it’s not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year,” he said. “But I think it has a good chance, there are two companies …I think within a matter of weeks.”

Mr Trump repeatedly tried bringing the conversation to unsubstantiated claims of Mr Biden’s family getting money from abroad. Through the last few days the Trump campaign and his allies have sought to bring attention to the foreign dealings of Mr Biden’s son, Hunter.

“We cannot all lock ourselves in a basement like Joe does,” Mr Trump said. “He has the ability to lock himself up…he made a lot of money someplace.”

Mr Biden questioned Mr Trump on why he hadn’t still released his tax returns as he had said he would, and brought up his “secret” Bank account in China. [ Mr Trump had declared the account in his tax documents but not in his public disclosure of assets as the account was held by one of his companies ].

“It’s not about his family and my family, it’s about your family. And your family’s hurting badly,” Mr Biden said at one point in the debate.

Mr Biden said he did not understand why Mr Trump was “unwilling to take on [ Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” on reports that Russia had offered bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan and Mr Putin’s actions to destabilize NATO .

“Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price, because they’re affecting our sovereignty,” Mr Biden said.

On North Korean leader Kim Jung Un, Mr Trump pointed out that there was no war with North Korea and that the he had a “good relationship.”

“Having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing,” Mr Trump said.

Mr Biden, who said he would (as president) talk to Mr Kim if the latter agreed to “drawing down” his nuclear capacity, likened Mr Trump’s position to having a good relationship with Adolf Hitler prior to the Nazis invasion of other European countries.

On race, Mr Trump defended his position on Black Lives Matter (the moderator had asked him about his equating it to a symbol of hate) but said he was the “least racist person in the room.” Mr Biden said Mr Trump was “one of the most racist Presidents we’ve had in modern history.”

On healthcare policy, Mr Biden said he was going to modify Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) to include a public option.

“Not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare,” Mr Biden said.

Mr Trump insisted that Mr Biden supported “socialized medicine” [ a government run healthcare system].

“He’s a very confused guy. He thinks he’s running against somebody else. He’s running against Joe Biden,” Mr Biden said. Mr Trump has repeatedly said Mr Biden is controlled by the “radical left” and progressive flank of the Democratic party.

“I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them,” Mr Biden said.

At one point, Mr Trump was asked about a report this week that the parents of 545 migrant children separated from their families at the southern border could not be located.

“They are so well taken care of. They’re in facilities that were so clean,” Mr Trump said. He also said that the Obama-Biden administration had built the cage like structures in which migrants were being held. [The Obama-Biden administration had in fact been criticized for its own border policies and tough approach to deportation. ]

Towards the end, the debate focussed a substantial amount of time on the two candidates’ climate policies. Mr. Trump asked Mr Biden if he would “close down the oil industry.” Mr Biden said “over time, over time” he would “transition” and would stop giving oil federal subsidies.

“Will you remember that, Texas? Will you remember that, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?,” Mr Trump said.

Mr Biden clarified after the debate that he wanted to end federal subsidies to oil companies and not get rid of fossil fuels , the Washington Post reported.

At the end of the debate, when asked what they would say at their hypothetical inaugural address to those who did not vote for them. Mr Trump used his time to say Mr Biden would cause an economic depression if elected and about his own economic record. Mr Biden said he would tell people he was there to represent all of them and was going to give them hope.",,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/rbqrai/article32754873.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THTRUMP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/final-presidential-debate-between-trump-and-biden-us-election-2020/article32924781.ece
31,2020/10/23,Edward Snowden granted permanent residency in Russia,"Snowden said last year that he would be willing to return to the U.S. if he’s guaranteed a fair trial.

Former U.S. security contractor Edward Snowden has been granted permanent residency in Russia, his lawyer said on Thursday.

Mr. Snowden, a former contractor with the U.S. National Security Agency, has been living in Russia since 2013 to escape prosecution in the U.S. after leaking classified documents detailing government surveillance programs.

“Today, Snowden was handed a residency permit for an unlimited period of time,” his Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena told Russia’s state Tass news agency.

Mr. Kucherena told the Interfax news agency that the application was submitted in April, but because of the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown restrictions, it took immigration authorities more time to consider it.

Mr. Snowden was able to obtain permanent residency rights because of the changes in Russia’s immigration laws made in 2019, the lawyer said.

Mr.Kucherena added that Mr. Snowden is not considering applying for Russian citizenship at the moment.

Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi next week for the third edition of the 2+2 ministerial.

“Certainly, I think the situation on the Line of Actual Control will be – will probably be discussed at some point, and we’re watching the situation closely. I think both sides have expressed a desire to de-escalate violence,” Deputy Assistant Secretary Dean Thompson told reporters on a briefing call on Thursday afternoon.

Mr. Thompson said that the two U.S. secretaries would also meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss ways to advance the U.S.- India partnership (officially known as a “Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership”).

He did not confirm whether BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) –a geospatial cooperation agreements between the U.S. and India – would be signed at the 2+2 meeting.

“We’re in the process of finalizing a lot of the discussions right now, and so I know that BECA and other agreements are in the works,” Mr. Thompson said in response to a question on BECA and a maritime information sharing agreement between the two countries.

“ I’m not going to, I think, commit to anything right this minute, but we do expect to have several items highlighted as we go through the trip,” he said.

The dialogue will focus on “ global cooperation, on pandemic response, and challenges in the Indo-Pacific: economic space and energy collaboration, people-to-people ties, and defense and security cooperation,” according to Mr. Thompson.

Meeting was rescheduled

On the question of this meeting being held just a week before the U.S. elections, Mr. Thompson said it was scheduled to be held earlier but was postponed due to the pandemic.

“There’s a lot happening in the relationship with India and with our other partners in the region, and so the fact that we could go now, that we could have this discussion, is driven by the situation in the region,” he said.

“As I noted in the – at the top, one of the topics of discussion, a very important topic of discussion, will be COVID-19 response, and so obviously now is a good time to do that.”

On a question about whether the spouses of Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Esper would be accompanying them to India and what resources were being used for this during the pandemic, an official said they did not have “anything to say about the minor details” of who will be in the traveling party.

Secretary Pompeo to travel to Sri Lanka, Maldives, Indonesia

After his visit to New Delhi, Mr. Pompeo will travel to Colombo, Male and Jakarta.

“We urge Sri Lanka to make difficult but necessary decisions to secure its economic independence for long-term prosperity, and we stand ready to partner with Sri Lanka for its economic development and growth.”

U.S. officials said on Thursday that Russian hackers have targeted the networks of dozens of state and local governments in the United States in recent days, stealing data from at least two servers.

The warning, less than two weeks before the election, amplified fears of the potential for tampering with the vote and undermining confidence in the results.

The alert describes an onslaught of recent activity from Russian state-sponsored hacking groups in recent days against state and local networks, some of which were successfully compromised.

The advisory from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency functions as a reminder of Russia’s potent capabilities even after U.S. officials warned about Iranian interference at a news conference on Wednesday night.

The advisory does not mention any of the specific victims who were targeted, but officials say they have no information that any election or government operations have been affected or that the integrity of elections data has been compromised.

U.S. officials attribute the activity to a state-sponsored hacking group variously known as DragonFly and Energetic Bear in the cybersecurity community. The group appears to have been in operation since at least 2011 and is known to have engaged in cyberespionage on energy companies and power grid operators in the US and Europe as well as defense and aviation companies.

“Egypt’s mass executions of scores of people in a matter of days is outrageous,” said HRW’s Joe Stork. The systematic absence of fair trials in Egypt, especially in political cases, makes every death sentence a violation of the right to life,” Mr. Stork said in a statement. Of the 49 killed, 15 were men convicted for alleged involvement in political violence.

They were convicted in three separate cases, including 10 prisoners accused of carrying out attacks in 2014 for the Islamist insurgent group Ajnad Masrm (Soldiers of Egypt).

Another three were executed for their alleged involvement in a 2013 attack on a police station in the Kerdassa suburb of Cairo, and two others for a violent demonstration in Alexandria in 2013.

The executions come after four security officers in Cairo were reported to have been killed by prisoners on death row, and four prisoners then killed when they allegedly tried to escape, HRW said.

Other prisoners put to death had been sentenced for crimes, including murder and rape.

A 2018 agreement between Beijing and the Vatican was renewed on Thursday, despite strident U.S. condemnation and warnings from underground Chinese priests loyal to Rome that they have only become more marginalised since it was signed.

The deal allows both Beijing and the Holy See a say in appointing bishops in an attempt to close a schism in China’s 12-million-strong Catholic community. Washington had put pressure on the Vatican to scrap the agreement, saying it has failed to shield Chinese Catholics from persecution.

Both sides agreed to the extension “for two years”, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Thursday. “The two sides will maintain close communication and consultation, and continue to push forward the process of improving relations.”

China severed ties with the Holy See in 1951, forcing Catholics to choose between membership of the State-run Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association or non-sanctioned churches loyal to the Pope.

Rashtriya Janata Dal leader and mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial face Tejashwi Yadav said on Friday that his father Lalu Prasad would come out of jail on November 9.

“Laluji... has got bail in one case and will secure one in another case on November 9, which also happens to be my birthday. The next day, on November 10, Nitishji will have his farewell,” he said at an election rally at Hisua in Nawada district, where he shared the dais with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

Convicted RJD chief Lalu Prasad is currently undergoing treatment at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), while staying in Kelly’s bungalow inside the hospital premises. He was recently granted bail by the Jharkhand High Court in one of the fodder scam cases, but could not come out of jail as his bail plea in another case was yet to be heard. He is expected to get bail when the petition is taken up on November 9 as he would have already completed more than half of the jail term in the case by that date.

The three-phase election to the Bihar Assembly will end on November 7 and the results will be out on November 10.

Mr. Yadav accused the Nitish Kumar government of failure to end corruption, create jobs and stop migration of workers to other States. “Nitishji, you are tired…you won't be able to take care of Bihar now,” he said. Recalling Mr. Kumar’s recent statement that Bihar had missed the industrialisation boom as it was “landlocked,” Mr. Yadav reiterated his promise to create 10 lakh government jobs if voted to power. “Those who did not give you jobs, education, health facilities and industries in 15 years will not do all this in the next five years,” he said.

Later, addressing the media in Patna, the RJD leader said he was expecting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to say something about this. “Mr. Modi should ask Nitish Kumarji and tell us why in the last 15 years of his [Mr Kumar’s] regime no industrialisation has taken place in the State and why no employment was generated…And I also want to ask PM Modi when Bihar will get the special State status and a special package,” he said.

“Now BJP says 19 lakh jobs will be created in five years if they come to power, but I would like to ask in which BJP ruled State have they provided even 5 lakh jobs in the last five years,” said the RJD leader.

38,2020/10/23,Modi lied to nation on Chinese incursion: Rahul Gandhi,"Tejashwi Yadav hits out at Nitish Kumar for “staying put at home” due to coronavirus threat and coming out now to ask for votes.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi lied to the nation on Chinese incursion in Ladakh.

Addressing an election meeting at Hisua in Nawada, Bihar, he also criticised Mr. Modi for allegedly not doing anything for the migrant workers returning to Bihar during the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

He said, “Our 20 soldiers were martyred and China took over 1200 km of our land in Ladakh… when China entered into our land, why did the Prime Minister say no one came inside Indian land... youth from Bihar shed their sweat and blood to protect their motherland there… it is an insult to our soldiers”.

Later he addressed another rally at Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur.

Mr. Gandhi said, “When migrant workers from Bihar were chased away by other States, what did the Prime Minister do?... he didn’t help them… this is the truth and I trust that this time, the people of Bihar will realise this truth and give a befitting reply to him and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar”.

“Labourers of Bihar left for their native State and walked thousands of km without food and water. Did he [Modi] offer buses, trucks, trains to go back home?” “No”, he said.

The former Congress president ‘requested’ Mr. Modi not to lie to the people of Bihar. “In the last election, you promised them to provide two-crore employment? What did they get?... you come and say that you bow down your head before farmers, soldiers, workers and small businessmen, and when you return home, you do work for Ambani and Adani”, he said. “He will bow down his head before you but will do work for someone else”, he added.

Mr. Gandhi asked the gathering if they got any benefit from demonetisation. “You all stood outside banks in heat and rain… You deposited your money into banks but where your money has gone”, he asked. “In pockets of the rich people of the country”, he responded himself.

“Did Adani stand before banks?... did Ambani stand in queue in front of banks?... our governments in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Punjab waived farmers loan”, he claimed.

At Kahalgaon, he said that he had been saying since February that the poor, labourers and the country would suffer massive losses due to the corona virus and he was ridiculed. “But Mr. Modi said that India will be free of corona virus within 22 days. How? By clanging utensils and shining torches and mobile phones lights? It has been 6-7 months since then and the virus is still spreading and the Prime Ministeris not speaking a word”, he observed.

Tejashwi hits out Nitish

At the meeting, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav hit out at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for “staying put at home” due to the corona virus threat and coming out now to ask for votes.

“Nitish Kumar stayed inside the house for 144 days but now he is out of his residence. Why? Coronavirus was there at that time and now as well, but now he wants your vote, so he has to step out”, he said.

Mr. Yadav reiterated that if voted to power, 10 lakh jobs would be given to youths. “In my first Cabinet meet, I’ll sign on order giving 10 lakhs govt jobs to Bihar youth”, he said.

“Mr. Kumar is tired now and can’t handle Bihar. The Congress is contesting the polls with the RJD, the CPI, the CPI(M) and the CPI-ML”, he stated.

On Mr. Modi’s election rallies, he said, “He is most welcomed in Bihar but he should also give answers about what happened to special status to Bihar, absence of factories, unemployment and other state issues”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/q409b3/article32928870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN23RAHUL,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/modi-lied-to-nation-on-chinese-incursion-rahul/article32928740.ece
39,2020/10/23,Bihar Assembly elections | Bihar needs Nitish-led NDA govt. for development: Modi,"At poll rallies, he clarifies that NDA means BJP, JD(U), HAM(S) and the VIP.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asserted that an National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government led by Nitish Kumar was necessary for the development in Bihar.

At a rally in Sasaram, his first in poll-bound Bihar, Mr. Modi clarified that the NDA in Bihar meant the BJP, the JD(U), the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) HAM(S) and the Vikasheel Insaan Party (VIP). He did not mention the Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (LJP).

In the backdrop of the bitterness between the JD(U) and the LJP, with Mr. Paswan regularly attacking Mr. Kumar, it was much awaited what Mr. Modi would say on the issue in his public meetings. He addressed three public meetings in the State on Friday, at Sasaram, Gaya and Bhagalpur.

In all, he would address 12 public meetings during the three-phase polls, which would end on November 7. Counting of votes is on November 10.

At his first rally in Sasaram, Mr. Modi said, “For a self-reliant Bihar, an NDA government is necessary. We’re with Nitish Kumar for the development of Bihar, who got only three or four years to work and bring development to the State. For about 10 years, he was engrossed in battling the UPA government’ s politics of not allowing him to work”.

The Prime Minister asserted, “even before the polls, people of Bihar have given their message… all surveys show that the NDA government will retain power”.

Mr. Kumar, BJP leaders and candidates were present at the meeting.

Scrapping of Article 370

Mr. Modi mentioned about the Union government’s decision to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. “Everyone was waiting for Article 370 to be repealed but these people [Opposition] are saying they will revoke the decision once they are voted to power. And after making such statements, they dare to ask for votes from Bihar? Is this not an insult to the State, one which sends its sons and daughters to the borders to protect the country?”, he said.

Also read: People are looking for change, says CPI leader D. Raja

The NDA government worked for the development of the poor and Dalits in the State. “Our government extended reservation to the poor and Dalits for 10 years”, he claimed.

There would be one common entrance examination for jobs for the youth of the country. “All technical education like medical and engineering will be imparted in local languages, and it will benefit everyone in the country”, he stated.

NDA’s work

Listing out the NDA government’s achievements, he said, “Bihar’s 74 lakh farmers have been given ₹6,000 crore directly in their bank accounts through PM Kisan Yojna… farmers, businessmen and all will also benefit in Bihar through reforms in connectivity”.

“If Bihar had not acted fast, COVID-19 would have killed many more people. It would have been unimaginable mayhem. But today, Bihar, having battled the pandemic, is now celebrating the festival of democracy”, he observed.

Slamming the RJD and the Congress, he stated that before the NDA rule, Bihar suffered from crime and corruption. “But now, there is no need for the lamp or lantern in the State as it has electricity”.

Farm laws

Mr. Modi spoke about new farm laws, criticising the Opposition parties protesting against them. “Mandi aur MSP to bahana hai….asal mein dalalo aur bicghauliyon ko bachana hai [village markets and MSP (Minimum Support Price) are just excuses… it’s all to protect middlemen and brokers]”.

“When Rafale jet planes were bought, they were speaking the language of middlemen and when the initiative began to give money directly to farmers’ bank accounts before the 2014 Lok Sabha poll, they started spreading rumours”, he said.

“People have decided that those who have a history of making Bihar bimaru will not be allowed to return in the State”, he said, in an oblique reference to the previous RJD governments.

The RJD governments under Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi were in power from 1990 to 2005.

“Ab sarkar ki har suvidha mobile per [now every government facility is on mobile]”, he claimed. He also declared that after the, the NDA government would implement “Swamitwa Yojna [ownership project]” to buy and sell properties in villages. “Under this project, villagers will get property cards. Through this, they will feel safe about their households and can even get loans from banks against their homes... this project is being implemented in six States as a pilot project”, he noted.

“Bihar has now taken speed on the road to reform and we’ll not let it slow down… in the next few years, Bihar will be among the States where every household has tap water”, he stated.

Gaya rally

At a public meeting in Gaya, Mr. Modi asserted that Bihar was making rapid progress in health and education.

“Today, educational institutions like IITs and IIMs are opening in Bihar... earlier students were striving even for schools in the State”, he said.

“Earlier, it was the age of lamps and lanterns in the State… fear of being kidnapped was felt across the State but today things have changed a lot… steps were taken to eliminate the Naxal problem and crime for the State’s development”, he observed.

“Their [Opposition’s] moral was to make Bihar bimar [sick] and lachar [helpless] but the NDA’s resolve is to make Bihar capable and self-reliant”, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qy6gcx/article32926692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMODINITISH,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-those-with-history-of-making-state-bimaru-wont-be-allowed-to-return-modi/article32926693.ece
40,2020/10/23,‘The Queen’s Gambit’ review: Binge this series all knight long,"The talented Anya Taylor Joy and Oscar-winning screenwriter-director Scott Frank come together in ‘The Queen’s Gambit’, which makes chess appealing to non-players in mesmeric ways

Since childhood, I steered clear of chess, feeling that the people who often played it were just far too intense — and in some cases, too snobby — for my liking. It always remained an enigmatic sport for the umpteen rules to remember, and the energy seemed way more than what the sport was worth. But yes, I always considered chess a sport; in its essence, it is competitive that exercises some part of the human body.

The Queen’s Gambit, Netflix’s latest psychological-drama limited series based on the eponymous 1983 novel by Walter Tevis, sums up the sport and its pressures through the eyes of Elizabeth Harmon, played by Anya Taylor Joy (The Miniaturist, Glass). Yes, chess is the central nervous system of the series, but the heart and soul is Beth.

At the start of the series, which is set in a Cold War era, Beth loses her mother in a car accident and is placed in a girls’ home until she is adopted by the cheery Alma Wheatley (Marielle Heller) and her stoic husband. Much of the first episode narrates her loss as well as her gain of chess-playing abilities, learning from the orphanage’s gruff janitor, William Shaibel. Unfortunately, during this time, Beth swallows several handfuls of blue and green tranquillisers. These distinct-looking pills would become central to the story later.

Anya Taylor Joy is transfixing as the socially-aloof and checkmate-driven Beth, slicing through chess matches like a hot knife through butter. This noticeable in even the most nuanced movements such as the pensive posture and minute eye movements while she studies the chess-board. Through the series, as Beth meets her matches (no pun intended) across different verticals, audiences are kept on their toes by an unpredictable yet entrancing Joy whose talent is only further stoked alive by Frank’s impeccable writing and directing.

Even as her fame propels her all over the world and sees her gracing the cover of chess magazines, Beth’s exterior in the first few episodes is rarely affected. Only when she meets photographer Townes (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd) do we see a shy warmth, and it is a pining that forges on through the remaining episodes.

Checkmate casting

The Queen’s Gambit sees an impressive supporting cast, all of whom impact Beth’s life in some shape or form. Tina Gerussi and the rest of the series’ casting team can call checkmate of the groundswell of raw talent in the show.

Following the adoption, Alma’s husband leaves the family ultimately binding mother and child in a unique relationship where Beth’s long-nurtured chess talent sees Alma becoming an agent of sorts, collecting 15% commission on the matches’ wins. Heller shines as Alma, straddling the line as a parental figure and business partner, cementing for audiences that the two are not necessarily traditional mother and daughter, but there is a remarkable symbiosis.

Beth’s enigma draws in many a male admirer. She meets the lovable Harry Beltik (Harry Melling, The Devil All The Time, Harry Potter) who is instantly enchanted by Beth but she does not return his feelings. Melling, in his few scenes across the episodes, is a scene-stealer, occupying a space between unassuming innocence and worldly knowledge, the latter coming to light in later episodes. And then there’s the charming Benny (Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Love Actually) who carries an alluring swagger about him that piques the usually reserved Beth’s interest. Each encounter reveals more about the Beth audiences loves and learns to love more.

But one of the most remarkable relationships is Beth’s competition with Russian champion Vasily Borgov (Marcin Dorocinski). Beth meets Borgov and loses dismally in a match but competing with him becomes something of a mission, though they rarely interact. Dorocinski’s expressions are set in an almost clay-like manner, unmoving even at the most tense nexus of a match which is disconcerting.

A beautiful game

Chess, inherently being a visually-charged sport, has to be portrayed on screen thoughtfully. Frank and cinematographer Steven Meizler and editor Michell Tesoro have risen to the challenge of bringing a confusing-to-some sport to the screen for all. The Queen’s Gambit‘s visual elements are only elevated by the smatterings of tilting shots and VFX-melded frames. When Beth falls into addiction, the cinematography reflects this but through nuanced subtlety rather than the cliched manner.

Sound and music are inherently their own storytellers in the series; from composer Carlos Rafael Rivera’s numerous scores each like a fingerprint of a given scene, to the hypnotic sound design by Wiley Stateman. The core sound to series is the chess timer’s ticking, often bringing the audience’s focus to that very moment a match is taking place. It is a sound that is synonymous with the sport and is successfully inserted alongside the most strategic frames.

The series itself is a dark horse from Netflix, having been in quiet production for almost two years. That said, the pace of Beth’s own story is best suited for the steady thrum of a series rather than a one-shot film. The debate of ‘choice versus the only choice’ is resounding across the seven episodes; Beth is a chess pioneer thanks to her good choices and moves, whereas her pull into addicted is justified by anything but. The story is not always an easy watch, perhaps triggering at some parts, but as audiences watch Beth grow, the attachment evolves into something that’s not entirely formulaic to most female-led series.

So, what am I most grateful for watching The Queen’s Gambit? That I wasn’t taught — actively or passively — how to play chess, but rather introduced to the mind-boggling pressure players must surely experience... undoubtedly, the most rewarding feelings taken away from the series are empathy and understanding.

41,2020/10/23,Chennai birder’s photo commended by London’s Natural History Museum,"Sambath Subbaiah’s photo won appreciation as part of Wildlife Photographer of the Year award in the Birds Behaviour category.

Their eyes are locked in fierce competition. Who will strike first? Chennai birder and wildlife photographer Sambath Subbaiah chanced upon a short-toed snake eagle and a rat snake in combat, in March last year at Senneri lake in Kanchipuram. He took out his camera to document the action and was rewarded with a series of images. One of them, that shows the bird and snake with their eyes interlocked, moments before striking, stands out: It was commended under the Birds Behaviour category in Wildlife Photographer of the Year award from London’s Natural History Museum, announced last week.

“This is a prestigious award and I’m thrilled,” says the 36-year-old who is an IT manager. It had started out as a regular day of birding for Sambath that day; he recalls heading to the outskirts of Chennai with his daughter and a friend. The sun was about to set and the light was falling when he saw them. “The five-foot long rat snake had coiled around the eagle’s tail and feet,” he recalls. It had seemed like the eagle was losing the battle.

Sambath Subbaiah | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

“It struggled,” says Sambath. By then, Sambath had begun clicking away his camera. “These are the kind of moments you dream of capturing as a photographer,” he says. “But it was challenging; it was almost 6.15 pm and the lighting was poor.” Minutes in, the eagle and the snake were about to strike each other at the same time. “The eagle won, of course,” says Sambath. After all, its main diet consists of snakes.

Sambath hopes that his award creates awareness on the importance of the grassland ecosystem. “As our cities expand at a drastic pace, we must remember to preserve our waterbodies,” he says. Grasslands around waterbodies, Sambath explains, are crucial for snakes to survive. “And snakes keep rats, that are pests for farmers, in check,” he says, adding, “If this chain is broken, the entire cycle will go for a toss.” Sambath adds that all these seemingly “small things, are interlinked” and contribute to climate change.

Another aspect that Sambath wants to highlight is that, while people travel thousands of kilometres to see and photograph wildlife, they often miss out on what is in their backyard. “There’s so much to explore locally,” he feels.

The photo won him the award, sums up Sambath, due to a combination of factors. The most important of them was simply “being at the right place at the right time.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/c0w5lh/article32929887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23mpWinningpic,https://www.thehindu.com/society/chennai-birders-photo-commended-by-londons-natural-history-museum/article32929888.ece
42,2020/10/23,"In another India, Hindus and Muslims do marry without changing their faith","There has always existed a world in India beyond the imagination of fanatics, where religion is not one’s primary identity

I have lived through the #TanishqAd... my Muslim mother-in-law gifted me a mangalsutra and even godhbharai.”

Architect Rachna Lanewala, who tweeted this at the height of the Tanishq ad controversy last fortnight, is not the only woman to have “lived through” the experience depicted in the jewellery advertisement. Almost half a century ago, writer Saryu Rizvi’s parents would accompany each other to their respective shrines, be it the temple to get their new car blessed, or to the Karbala Maidan during Muharram.

There has always existed a world in India beyond the imagination of fanatics, where religion is not one’s primary identity, and a Hindu can marry a Muslim without either of them changing their faith. So, while in 1972, Saryu’s parents, hailing from Kanpur and Dehradun, could only consider getting married in Delhi, the question of conversion never came up.

Fully supportive

Neither did it come up in 1999 when Aasif Lanewala married his collegemate Rachna, whose parents, having migrated to Delhi after Partition, had warned her never to marry a Muslim. More than a thousand attended their Mumbai reception.

In 2012, journalist Mustafa Plumber, ignoring murmurs from the men in his family, declared that he wasn’t planning to convert his colleague Prachi Pinglay when they got married. After his younger brother’s nikaah, it was Prachi, guided by Mustafa’s mother, who performed the rituals expected of the eldest bahu (daughter-in-law).

The timeline from Saryu’s parents, who didn’t inform their families about their civil marriage right away, to Mustafa and Prachi, whose wedding was attended by both families, has not been a linear one.

Religious conversions happen even today, but far often than not, it is more a formality to please the families and not some “jihadi trap” as portrayed by the radical fringe. Thus Veena’s (name changed) conversion only meant a change in her official name. Straight after her wedding, her husband accompanied her to Tirupati for a long-desired pilgrimage.

Elopements too continue to take place in this world. In 1996, Vidya and Shoaib (names changed) fled to Vadodara after a secret wedding at the Registrar’s. Both belonged to joint families that had their own businesses. To their surprise, Shoaib’s parents called them back and hosted a grand dinner after a nikaah (marriage ceremony). Vidya’s uncle too, who had objected the most, became fully supportive.

Though Shoaib, despite having grown up in a Muslim locality, happily participated in Diwali pujas with his Marwari in-laws, Vidya took her new religion seriously — until she got drawn to meditation two years ago. Nobody had forced her to do namaaz and nobody objected when she stopped.

Secular upbringing

Contrary to popular belief, these Hindu-Muslim marriages are not restricted to the well-to-do. Masood Akhtar, who till recently lived in a slum, still wakes up to nightmares of the time he was beaten up by the police and put behind bars during the 1992-93 Mumbai riots. But he refused to let the trauma tarnish the secular upbringing he had had. As a boy, he would often accompany his father to his workshop to distribute Diwali sweets to his Hindu workers. When Masood informed his family that his Hindu fiancee’s name must remain unchanged after the nikaah, only his father supported him. Today, his joint family consults his wife Rama Shyam on everything. And every Durga Puja, Masood, Rama and their son go pandal-hopping.

The best part of this world is not the conservatives it manages to convert along the way, but the children born of such unions. Saryu fondly recalls her mother reading the Ramayana while the local maulana who had come to meet her waited patiently. “Accha, baaji paath padh rahi hai (Let sister finish reciting the Ramayana),” he would say. Her father named her after the U.P. river sacred to Hindus.

Aasif still regrets not being allowed to say ‘Indian’ in the religion column of his son’s birth certificate. When the child was four, he was asked by someone in Aasif’s hometown Dahod whether he was Hindu or Muslim. The cricket-crazy boy simply said, “I’m a Mumbai Indian”.

Mustafa finds that his two-year-old son has taken over what used to be his task on Diwali day — ringing the bell while Prachi performs Lakshmi puja. Sometimes, the toddler stands next to him when Mustafa performs the namaaz. “Let him find his own path,” say the parents.

Going forward, it is these children who will prove to be immune to the vitriol spewed by bigots.

43,2020/10/23,Back in the game: Hyderabad's restaurants welcome customers,"After almost six months of no activity, restaurants and night clubs in Hyderabad are set to party once more, albeit with caution

In September, when some of the staff of Haiku returned to the city from their home towns, after six months, they found that the open-air Asian-themed restaurant at Jubilee Hills hijacked by pigeons. Though cleaning seemed like an impossible task, there was a smile on the faces of the staff and Suma Chereddi, Haiku’s owner. Come October, Suma is thrilled to see a family of 21 celebrate a birthday on four different tables (due to social distancing).

As per Unlock 4.0, hotels, restaurants and bars are thinking of inventive ways to welcome back customers, despite the ongoing pandemic. As rooms at ITC Kohenur booked up again — this time for staycations — the hotel revived its lavish Sunday brunch spreads with whatever resources were available.

Having used the lockdown to calzones, pizzas and cheesy garlic bread to its menu, the team at Feranoz is loving the response. “On most weekends, we are sold out on our food menu. The comeback is good and hopefully we will all stay safe and continue to support each other’s businesses,” says co-founder Ameen Barazandeh.

Path to recovery

Dineout, a reservation and restaurant tech platform, has recovered 60% of its pre-COVID business. Delhi, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad are moving rapidly towards normalcy, with a 70% recovery rate projected to be achieved in this festive quarter, followed by Kolkata, Chennai, Jaipur and Hyderabad with a 55% recovery rate.

The growth curve can be credited to restaurants leaving no stone unturned in ensuring the safety of their customers and staff. They are promoting QR Code-driven digital menus, and digital payments, to minimise contact and optimise business.

In fact, at Marigold, for the hilsa food fest, customers are pre-booking tables. Abhishek Dhar, General Manager of Marigold Hotel, says, “This is absolutely thrilling for the staff after not having served guests for over five months.”

Caterer Rahul Sharma reflects, “Business may not be at 100%, instead it is at 50-60% but that is a positive feeling for the economy. Customers don’t mind the mask and are probably enjoying the less crowd, we just want our lives back.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/9jl1cg/article32929485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Haiku,https://www.thehindu.com/society/hyderabad-and-unlock-40/article32929487.ece
44,2020/10/23,Freelance editor Hemanth Paranji on his special moment,"Winning an award at the Emmys marks an important milestone for Hyderabad’s Hemanth Paranji

The five-month wait ended for Hemanth Paranji when he laid his hands on the coveted statuette recently. Though the Emmy awards live-streamed in April to announce the winning team of producer, reporter, writer, photographer and editor for their special event coverage of The World Cup Ticker Tape Celebration (for 2019) for WCBS TV, the celebrations started only now. Hemanth Paranji, the editor recalls, “Half the fun in watching a live show is the audience response; When nominations are read out, cameras show close-ups of nominees and audience roars in applause but this was different.”

A freelance editor for CBS and ABC Television in the US, Hemanth was nominated for a whopping seven categories (investigative news, breaking news and feature story). Connecting via email, Hemanth who hails from Hyderabad, says he expected to win more than one! “I was watching the show in my study room with the doors shut. My heart sank when others won; and I was mentally preparing to be in that ‘forever-a-nominee-club’. When I screamed ‘yahoo!’ on hearing my name, my wife and kids came running in and hand thumpings and hugs followed.”

The winning show The World Cup Ticker Tape Celebration was about a victory parade of the USA Women’s team that won the 2019 FIFA World Championship. The team interspersed the parade with 60 and 90-second news packages of players’ personal stories and how they trained individually. The five other nominees in the Special Events category included two teams from NYC Life Channel and BARD Entertainment Channel covering The World Cup Ticker Tape Celebration; and teams from FOX5, ABC7 & NY1 News for March of the Living, The New York International Auto Show and the Tony Awards Red Carpet show. He adds, “ABC7, a tough competitor got the lion’s share of the Emmys, so to beat them was a great feeling.”

This win is also special since Hemanth had been nominated for an ‘editor award’ four years ago for Crash of Delta Flight 101 show; but he didn’t win then. When the statuette got delivered to him, he reveals he had goosebumps while opening the package and his journey ‘in mainstream American media flashed in front of his eyes.’

Hemanth’s career began in the mid ’80s with an apprenticeship under Shyam Benegal and a brief stint assisting his brother Jayanth Paranji (Telugu film director) as well as Shumantro Goshal, Ram Madhvani and Johnny Pinto in Mumbai. He also made documentaries on LK Advani’s Rath Yatra and for Madhya Pradesh state government. Then Hemanth moved to New York. He calls the journey fulfilling and acknowledges his wife’s contribution to it He adds, “I also salute my colleagues and friends who are far ahead.”

Do innovations in filmmaking technologies impact video editing? “I do not foresee a good future for tech specialists including video editors especially in the television news industry,” says Hemanth and adds, “With a user-friendly software, there is a less need for photographers, editors and sound engineers. Transmission engineers can transmit even from a subway train.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/1tn8ml/article32929283.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym24hemanth,https://www.thehindu.com/society/freelance-editor-hemanth-paranji-shares-a-special-moment/article32929284.ece
45,2020/10/23,Drawing a new start line,"Forced diversity rules, like what the Oscars have introduced, give everyone a chance to play and win

Given its overwhelmingly white and masculine makeup — “pale, stale, male” — when the Oscars announced its new diversity rules last month, they were largely welcomed. The Academy said it hoped to not just reshape how movies are awarded, but also who makes movies and what stories are told. Amidst the bouquets the Academy got, there were also a predictable number of brickbats. These critics trotted out the usual arguments against affirmative action — arguments that are extremely familiar to us here and brought up frequently against reservations of all kinds.

The Academy’s website had comments that said: “It’s no longer about cinema as a genre of art. Now it’s about politics.” Another said: “Forced diversity lowers quality”. Actor Kirstie Alley raged: “I’m opposed to mandated arbitrary percentages... It’s impossible to ‘police’ quotas as a prerequisite for a ‘best’ picture.”

For me, sitting here in Chennai, there was a moment of déjà vu. Not so long ago, I was listening to an acquaintance, a senior manager in a multinational banking company, fume about the fact that they had recently been mandated to promote a certain number of women to the executive cadre to meet the company’s diversity rules. The manager’s objections were that first, she thought these women were not good enough to be promoted. Second, she resented having struggled to reach the top while these women would get a free pass. Third, she thought the move would backfire — the unqualified women would give their whole sex a bad name and reinforce prejudices against women.

On the face of it, these sound like rational objections, but scratch the surface and you see why her response, like Kirstie Alley’s, contributes even more to entrenched positions of deep inequality. Both women assume that the absence of ‘quotas’ means an objective preservation of the highest quality standards. But one look at the Oscar’s long history of awarding mediocrity shows you how fallacious this assumption is. If Gary Oldman can win the Oscar for hamming it as Churchill the same year that Daniel Day-Lewis was nominated for Phantom Thread; or if Around the World in 80 Days can win in a year when Seven Samurai was released, then quality is not exactly being upheld.

Rank bad performances regularly make the red carpet, so let’s not pretend that diversity rules alone will open the floodgates to less than stellar stuff. At any rate, so what? Let an imperfect film made by a Romani director win the statuette — it’s not going to ruin cinema any more than awarding it to Rocky did.

In offices too, incompetent men, duds and dullards, can be seen at all levels, including in leadership positions — positions where nothing but brilliance will be accepted from women. The office is men’s grazing ground — their actions and rewards, their foibles and follies all part of an ancient, well-oiled, and mutually beneficial ritual. Women have a lot of catching up to do to own this space, and that can happen only when there are enough of them for long enough. If diversity rules push a few women up the ladder even when they aren’t fully qualified, it’s a beneficial exercise. It goes on to create a large pool of female experience, confidence, mentorship and lineage that men have enjoyed for centuries.

I recently saw a brief experiment conducted by a teacher in an American school. He lined up a bunch of students for a race but before blowing the whistle, he asked those from a certain income group to step 50 metres forward; then those who were second-generation educated; then those who had libraries at home; and so on. Soon, many of the white students had advanced halfway down even before the race had begun.

This is structural inequality. The entry barriers to the race are so high for some that it’s a miracle they made it the field at all. They must be allowed to jump a few steps ahead and meet the other racers at a fresh start line. It’s not a fail-proof guarantee of success but it gives them a fighting chance in a game that the established contestants have been playing for eons. Forced diversity is invariably the first step to real diversity — whether in cinema or in workplaces. And we need to embrace it.

46,2020/10/23,Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I have done for the Black community,"Donald Trump during the final presidential debate

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden laced into U.S. President Donald Trump over his attacks on Muslims, insults against Mexico and his failure to condemn far-right extremists at the last debate.

“Come on, this guy is a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn,” Mr. Biden said sarcastically, in a reference to subtle, so-called dog whistle racism.

Mr. Trump, for his part, claimed his four years in office have been a time of historic improvement for African Americans.

49,2020/10/23,‘Pandemic to delay EV expansion’,"Low affordability, govt.’s shifting priorities are factors: Ind-Ra

The COVID-19 pandemic would delay the expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) in the Indian auto industry, according to India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).

Low affordability and the government’s priorities in reviving the otherwise suffering auto industry could shift the focus away from EVs in the interim, it said.

“Passenger vehicles (PVs) would face a double whammy as consumers would be wary of buying a costlier EV than an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle while original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) would refrain from incurring high capex,” the ratings agency said in a report.

Stating that the growth in buses may take a back seat as orders for city buses are largely from State transport undertakings, and as State governments were already grappling with falling GDPs, it said two wheelers, especially scooters, could see an upside due to the lower pricing gap between an EV and ICE and several models available to consumers.

“Though the EV penetration is likely to be faster in scooters, buses and three wheelers in the medium term (defined as three to five years), PVs may take longer.”

Ind-Ra said the underlying challenges in the adoption of EVs such as higher battery cost and reliance on imports would prevail in the medium term, and robust government policies would remain key for the development of EVs in the country.

It said reduced affordability and lower economic activities due to the pandemic could result in the automobile industry recording a decline in sales of over 20% yoy for the second consecutive year in FY21.

“This is likely to impact the sales of EVs which are costlier than an ICE vehicle. Two wheelers 2Ws have benefited from rural demand and shift to personal mobility, and the segment could be the least impacted with regard to electrification due to better pricing and model choices,” it said.

However, three-wheelers and buses, which have seen higher electrification in 2019, are among the most affected segments in FY21 and hence, could see a delay in electrification, it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pandemic-to-delay-ev-expansion/article32932741.ece

51,2020/10/23,ESIC scheme adds 9.3 lakh new members in August,"The latest data is part of a report released by the National Statistical Office.

Around 9.30 lakh new members joined ESIC-run social security scheme in August, against 7.55 lakh in the previous month, official data showed on Friday, giving a perspective on formal sector employment in the country.

The latest data is part of a report released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Friday. Gross new enrolments with the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) were registered at 8.21 lakh in June, 4.84 lakh in May and 2.61 lakh in April, showing an increase in enrolments after easing of lockdown.

The government had imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. Restrictions were eased from June. In March, as many as 8.21 lakh new members had joined the scheme run by ESIC, against 11.83 lakh subscribers in February, according to the payroll data released in May.

The NSO report showed gross enrolments of new subscribers with ESIC were 1.51 crore in 2019-20, against 1.49 crore in the previous fiscal. During the period September 2017 to March 2018, around 83.35 lakh new subscribers had joined the ESIC scheme.

The report said gross new enrolments with ESIC during September 2017 - August 2020 period were 4.17 crore. The NSO report is based on the payroll data of new subscribers of various social security schemes run by ESIC, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).

It has been releasing such data of these bodies since April 2018, covering the period starting from September 2017. According to the report, net new enrolments with retirement fund body EPFO stood at 10.05 lakh in August, up from 7.48 lakh in July.

Latest data showed that net new enrolments in April were in the negative zone at (-) 1,04,608 against the (-) 61,807 in September. This means that the number of members who exited the EPFO subscription was more than those who joined or rejoined the scheme.

Earlier in July, provisional data showed that net new enrolments for April stood at 1 lakh, which was revised down to 20,164 in August and further lowered to (-) 61,807 in September.

The number of net new enrolment in May was also revised to (-) 35,336, from 40,551 estimated in the data released last month.

The net new enrolments with EPFO had dropped to 5.72 lakh in March from 10.21 lakh in February, as per the payroll data released in May. Net new enrolments with EPFO hovered around 7 lakh every month on an average.

During 2019-20, the number of net new subscribers rose to 78.58 lakh compared to 61.12 lakh in the preceding fiscal, according to the latest payroll data in the report.

The data showed that during September 2017-August 2020 period, around 3.58 crore (gross) new subscribers joined the Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme.

The report titled ‘Payroll Reporting in India: An Employment Perspective - August 2020’, said since the number of subscribers is from various sources, there are elements of overlap and the estimates are not additive.

NSO said the report gives different perspectives on the levels of employment in the formal sector and does not measure employment at a holistic level.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z3j4h7/article30913371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-EPFO-employee-provident-fund-organisation,https://www.thehindu.com/business/esic-scheme-adds-93-lakh-new-members-in-august/article32929788.ece
52,2020/10/23,The lowdown on India’s luxury home market,"Ready-to-move apartments in the ₹2 cr to ₹5 cr range are getting popular

The past few months have seen the luxury home buyer making a comeback. Since COVID-19, buyers across segments have deferred their buying decisions. In the case of those eyeing luxe homes, however, the lockdown has given them time to look for one that suits their needs best.

A recent FICCI-ANAROCK report states that this particular buyer group has not been impacted much by the pandemic. In addition, lowered interest rates, reduced stamp duty and registration charges in many States, the six-month moratorium etc. have given relief to home buyers. “With all these measures being implemented and an ease in restrictions, the market has slowly improved. Sales have phenomenally increased in the last two months,” says Rajesh Gurumurthy, Senior Director, Head, Strategic Consulting, Tamil Nadu & Sri Lanka, at Jones Lang LaSalle. Many States are already claiming to have registered more properties compared to the March-June period. With buyers looking for good offers during the festive season, developers are also seeing the change in lifestyles and accommodating their requests, says Gurumurthy.

This gradual improvement in demand for luxury residences is also noted by Shveta Jain, Managing Director, Residential Services, Savills India. “It comes on the back of corrected valuations of properties both in the primary and secondary residential segments. Post-lockdown, demand is also returning slowly due to flexible payment plans, reduced interest rates, and some discounting.”

Buyer sentiments

How do developers view buyer sentiment? Ram Raheja, Director, S. Raheja Realty, says that the pandemic has made people want a home of their own. “Families usually shift between cities due to work patterns, which is why they rent homes. Today, this pattern is disrupted. Buyers are looking for inbuilt amenities like a club house, yoga centre, swimming pool, gym, playground, jogging track, etc.”

In Chennai, the conversion rates have certainly improved in the last few months. “Earlier site visit to sales conversion was 10% but now the conversion is going up to 20-25%, which means we are getting serious buyers at every project,” says T. Chitty Babu, Chairman and CEO, Akshaya.

Having said that, people are more particular about choosing projects that have adapted to the post-Covid design brief. The emphasis is on property management, indoor and outdoor sanitisation systems, and air filtration systems, among others. Home automation systems with sensor-based elevators, hands-free faucets, automatic shoe-cover dispensers, and touch-free soap dispensers are now essentials, says JLL’s Gurumurthy, adding that indoor specifications such as anti-viral surface coatings and self-doctoring surface treatments are also trending.

In most projects, people have started looking for larger spaces, adds Babu. “Those who were earlier looking at 2BHK apartments have started looking for 2.5 BHK and people who were looking at 3BHK units want larger spaces. The WFH concept has aided this trend.”

Second homes

What Jain is also witnessing is that buyers are not only opting for city-centric locations, but are also open to buying high-end residences in the suburbs. “We are also seeing an increase in the demand for second homes in locations that were not considered earlier. With work-from-home (WFH) fast becoming an accepted norm in the corporate world, both buyers and renters are out in the market looking for second properties,” she says, adding that the trend is expected to pick up in the coming months.

Second-home buyers are no longer considering rental income or future appreciation — the demand is mainly from end-users who want to leverage on lower property prices in such locations and stay close to the city, says Gurumurthy. “Major second home hotspots in Chennai include the city centre, and the ECR with beach-front properties. Some also purchase residences in hill stations or other tourist locations.”

Price point

Gurumurthy says the demand is fairly good for ready-to-move flats in the ₹2 crore to ₹5 crore range. Does he expect a price reduction in coming months? “Mumbai has the most active luxury market and the price corrections are expected to be higher. However, buyers are insisting on discounts up to 40%, which becomes unrealistic for developers. Understanding the other markets, the price corrections are expected between 5-10% or below,” he says.

In Chennai, 50% of 944 units (priced above ₹5 crore) have been absorbed and of the 3,867 units priced between ₹2 crore and Rs. 5 crore, 59% are sold.

Developers are recasting payment plans and other incentives to accelerate the buying decisions of consumers, says Jain. “Some builders have even initiated time-bound 10:90 and 20:80 schemes to expedite demand. This trend is visible in at least the top five cities in India.",,https://www.thehindu.com/real-estate/t77sum/article32927697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1158432430-2,https://www.thehindu.com/real-estate/the-lowdown-on-indias-luxury-home-market/article32927700.ece
53,2020/10/23,Details of a corpus fund,"Your property-related legal queries answered by S.C. RAGHURAM, Partner, RANK Associates, a Chennai-based law firm

Is it mandatory for the owner of a resale to pay towards a corpus fund? I have bought a four-year-old apartment and my owner has already paid the corpus fund to the builder. Now, the apartment association is requesting me to pay a sum towards the corpus fund as I am a new member. Is it mandatory to pay this every time a member changes? Is there any time limit, etc.?

Rajesh Kanna

Coimbatore

Normally, the corpus fund relates to the apartment and not the owner. On resale, the deposit should be deemed as transferred to the new purchaser and there will be no need for any further payment. Please look into the bye-laws for any specific provision relating to this aspect.

I request you to kindly clarify the details regarding the 1% TDS to be deducted from the payment to be made to the builder when purchasing a flat. What are the heads to be included in calculating the 1% TDS? The builder has broadly classified the total cost under these heads: cost of UDS, construction cost, car park charges, GST, registration of both agreements, corpus fund, sales tax, CMDA charges, EB charges, deposit, etc. How is a 1% TDS calculated on the total cost of the flat (including all costs)? Please advise on whether any of the heads have been included in calculating the 1% TDS in the budget 2019-20. Have there been any changes or modifications in the 2020-21 budget? What is the GST rate payable by the builder on the sale of a flat?

54,2020/10/23,"No info leaked to media on Sushant case, probe agencies tell HC","Pleas seek guidelines for media houses to refrain from publishing comments which may jeopardise reputation of police

The Bombay High Court was told on Friday that none of the Central agencies probing the actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case has leaked any information to the media.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a bunch of public interest litigation petitions seeking a direction to authorities to issue guidelines to be followed by all media houses to refrain from publishing comments which may jeopardise the reputation of the police that may hinder the cause of administration of justice.

Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, appearing for the CBI, reassured the court that all the three agencies — the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate and the Narcotics Control Bureau — investigating the case have not leaked any information to the media.

Mr. Singh said, “We know our responsibilities and there is no question of leaking information by any of the agencies.”

When the advocate representing Zee News cited some old judgments arguing against a statutory regulatory mechanism, the court said, “Journalists were responsible back then and the media was neutral then. It is now highly polarised .... This is not a question of regulation, this is a question of checks and balances. People forget where to draw lines. Do it within lines.”

Chief Justice Datta went on to say, “You want to criticise the government, do it. The issue is someone has died and the allegation is you are interfering. We are ruled by the rule of law. In India there is a rule of law, right? How do you advocate that people who go around accusing others can find shelter of freedom of press?”

55,2020/10/23,Restore Kashmir's flag: Mehbooba,"Gupkar Alliance to decide on contesting polls, says Mehbooba Mufti

Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on October 23 said she was not interested in contesting elections or holding the National Flag till the Constitutional changes enforced on August 5, 2019 were rolled back.

In her first media interaction after her release from 14-month detention, the PDP president said she would hold the tricolour only when the separate flag of the erstwhile State would be restored.

“As far as I am concerned, I have no interest in elections. Till the time the Constitution under which I used to contest elections is returned to us, Mehbooba Mufti has got nothing to do with elections, let me tell you that,” she said.

Asked if her party and the Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration will contest the District Development Council (DDC) elections, she said a meeting of the alliance will be held on October 24 where these issues will also be discussed apart from the general situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

Asked further whether not contesting these polls will be like conceding space to the BJP, Ms. Mufti said it was a hypothetical question. “You are discussing everything hypothetically. The alliance will sit and discuss it. It is not about the BJP and its cronies. Because people have to survive and God forbid, it should not happen that they (people) will come into the hands of those where they will be kicked out. So, we will take a decision keeping in mind all the pros and cons. Farooq (Abdullah) sahib is our leader, so we will take the right decision after everyone gives his opinion,” she said.

Editorial | Valley’s voice: On J&K’s Gupkar alliance

The flag of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir was prominently placed on a table in front of the PDP president along with the party flag during the presser. It was for the first time that the PDP displayed the flag of the erstwhile State at a party function or a presser.

“This is my flag,” Ms. Mufti said, pointing to the flag of the erstwhile State, when a reporter asked her about her statement that if Article 370 was revoked, there will be no one left to hold India’s flag. “When this flag of ours is restored, we will hold that flag (tricolour) also. But we will not hold any other flag till the time our flag, which was robbed from us, comes into our hold,” she said.

Ms. Mufti said the tricolour was part of the Constitution and the BJP had desecrated that Constitution and flag. When a rape incident took place in Kathua area of Jammu, the BJP came out with that flag and raised slogans in support of the rapist.

She said Jammu and Kashmir’s relation with India was because of the erstwhile State’s special Constitutional position which included a separate flag. “When they themselves desecrated that Constitution and that flag, what do they expect from us? Our relation with that flag (tricolour) was because of this flag (erstwhile State’s) and it (the relationship) is not independent of this flag,” she said.

Hitting out at the BJP, Ms. Mufti said the party has “demolished” the country’s Constitution and wants to replace it with its manifesto. She regretted that the Opposition parties in the country, except a few, went silent on the issue thinking this happened in Kashmir and not with them.

“But then, the BJP demolished the same Constitution, the BJP passed the Citizenship Amendment Act and polarised the people. Then made an anti-farmer law and now, I think they will steal the rights of the downtrodden communities like Dalits,” she said. “They want to replace the country’s Constitution with the BJP’s manifesto, but this will not work. So many people like Pharaoh and Hitler came, but this dictatorship will not work.”

Comment | A year on, Article 370 and Kashmir mythmaking

Ms. Mufti said the BJP does not want the people of Jammu and Kashmir and is only after the “territory”.

“The people of Jammu and Kashmir are expendable for them, what they want is the territory. They had this territory rightfully till August 5, 2019, but then they broke a relation by virtue of which we had entered into an accession with them,” she said.

The PDP chief lashed out at the BJP for desecrating the Constitution and “looting” the dignity of the people of Jammu and Kashmir by revoking its special status. “We had acceded to a liberal, democratic, secular India. Let me tell them we are not comfortable, we are incompatible with today’s India where minorities and Dalits are not safe and where they tried to disrespect us by looting our dignity. They will have to think, if not today, then tomorrow, that this country will run on India’s Constitution and not on the BJP’s manifesto,” she said.

Ms. Mufti said the BJP-led government had nothing to show and rake up except for Kashmir and Article 370 to seek votes.

“They have demonised Kashmiris, Muslims and even Dalits for that matter in the media and when they fail at anything, they remember Kashmir and Article 370,” she alleged.

Ms. Mufti also saluted IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan who quit the service in 2019 “over denial of freedom to the people of J&K”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v1fu1y/article32932725.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MEHBOOBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gupkar-alliance-to-decide-on-contesting-polls-says-mehbooba-mufti/article32932726.ece

Mr. Swamy, a Jesuit priest and activist working with tribals, was arrested on October 8 from his residence at Ranchi and was brought to Mumbai the next day. He was remanded in judicial custody from October 9.

Advocates Sharif Shaikh and Kritika Agarwal, representing the octogenarian, told the court that Mr. Swamy has been suffering from Parkinson’s disease and has almost lost hearing ability in both ears. He has fallen in jail multiple times.

Mr. Shaikh sought his bail on humanitarian grounds and as per the recommendations of the committee appointed by the Supreme Court to release prisoners in view of COVID-19 outbreak.

58,2020/10/23,Coronvirus | India has 30 vaccine programmes against SARS-CoV-2: Gagandeep Kang,"They span every platform that is available in any part of the world, says the clinician-scientist at Vellore CMC

India currently has some 30 vaccine programmes against SARS-CoV-2, “and they span every platform that is available in any part of the world,” said Gagandeep Kang, clinician-scientist at the Christian Medical College, Vellore.

The country has four vaccines that are in clinical trials, and the first one — Covaxin, which is the inactivated vaccine made by Bharat Biotech — will be going into phase 3 clinical trials fairly soon, said Prof. Kang. She was speaking at the last of a three-part seminar jointly hosted by TNQ and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus.

Virtual seminars

The virtual seminars aimed to discuss the latest research on COVID-19 and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the impact of the pandemic on human population and the state of development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

Worldwide, there are some 154 vaccines in the preclinical phase, 44 in clinical trials, of which 10 are already in phase 3 trials, said Florian Krammer, Professor of Vaccinology at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, U.S. However, even if vaccines are eventually licensed and enter the market, there will be hurdles to be crossed, he said: “There may be issues with large scale production, distribution may be an issue with the number of vaccines needed, something that is true for administration too.”

“We also have to keep in mind that it takes time for immunity to set in,” said Prof. Krammer — “most of these vaccines have to be given twice and it may take two months by the time you are protected.” He added that longevity could be an issue too. “We do not yet know how long immunity will last, but it might be that booster doses after one, two or three years might be needed.”

In terms of therapeutics, we still do not have “a silver bullet,” said Prof. Krammer. “We need new drugs to deal with the virus during the early phases of infection and deal with the immune system in the late stage of infection.”

59,2020/10/23,CVC amends SOP for adoption of Integrity Pact in govt. organisations,"Maximum tenure of Integrity External Monitors has been restricted to three years

The Central Vigilance Commission has amended the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on adoption of “Integrity Pact” in government organisations for procurement activities, and restricted the maximum tenure of Integrity External Monitors (IEMs) to three years in an organisation.

The latest order revises the SOP issued in January 2017. In Para 5.2, the amended provision states that the choice of IEM should be restricted to officials from the government and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) who have retired from positions of the level of Secretary to the Central government or of equivalent pay scale.

Such officials who retired as Chairman and Managing Directors (CMDs) of PSUs — Schedule 'A' companies and CMD/Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer levels in the Public Sector Banks (PSBs), insurance companies and financial institutions — should be at least of the level of Additional Secretary or its equivalent.

“Officers of the Armed Forces who have retired from the rank equivalent of General may also be considered for appointment. Preference would be given to persons who have worked in any other sector, other than their own, or have worked as CVO [Chief Vigilance Officer] in any organisation,” says the order.

Under the 2017 order, the officials who had retired from positions of the level of Additional Secretary to the Central government and above, or equivalent pay scale, were eligible for the PSUs, board level officers in Schedule 'A' companies, PSBs, insurance companies and financial institutions. Officers of the Armed Forces who had retired from the rank equivalent to Lieutenant-General and above could also be considered for appointment.

The amended Para 5.3 provides that for appointment as IEM, the Ministry, department or organisation concerned has to forward a panel of suitable persons to the CVC, of those persons who are in the panel maintained by the Commission. The previous corresponding provision stated that the panel could include those already in the panel maintained by the Commission, or they could propose names of other suitable persons.

Earlier, Para 5.7 stated that the initial tenure of IEM would be three years and it could be extended for another term of two years on a request received by the Commission from the organisation concerned, fixing the maximum tenure at five years in an organisation.

The latest orders provides that the IEM will be appointed for a period of three years in an organisation.

According to the Commission, “Integrity Pact” is a vigilance tool that envisages an agreement between the prospective vendors/bidders and the buyer, committing both the parties not to exercise any corrupt influence on any aspect of the contract. The pact is also to ensure transparency, equity and competitiveness in public procurement.

The IEMs independently and objectively review the documents to determine if the parties have complied with their obligations under the pact. They may submit a report to the chief executive of the organisation concerned or directly to the CVO and the CVC, if they find serious irregularities attracting the Prevention of Corruption Act provisions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/c2sgkx/article32932524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24th-cvc,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cvc-amends-sop-for-adoption-of-integrity-pact-in-govt-organisations/article32932525.ece

61,2020/10/23,"A ‘mistake’ to have walked out of Quad, Malabar exercise in 2008: Australian envoy Barry O’Farrell","From 2017 onwards, after the revival of Quad, Australian government had requested India to rejoin the exercise

Australia should not have walked out of the Quad, and subsequently the Malabar exercises with India, but was “delighted” at New Delhi’s decision to invite it to participate in this year’s naval exercises in November, Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell said.

Referring to the his government’s announcement in 2008 that it would not participate in the Quad exercises with India, Japan and the United States, he said it probably became the reason India took three years to accept Australia’s request to rejoin the exercises, despite requests from 2017-2020.

“I can say that, with the benefit of hindsight, clearly that it [withdrawing from Malabar] was a mistake. I suspect earlier in the piece, that became a stumbling block, and that was not forgotten in terms of reassembling Australia as part of that exercise,” Mr. O’Farrell said in an interview to The Hindu.

Earlier this week, the Ministry of Defence announced that all four countries of the Quadrilateral would take part in the Malabar exercises scheduled at the end of November to be held in two phases on both sides of the Indian coastline in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. This will be the first such exercise after India signed logistical agreements with all Quad partners, and is expected to see greater interoperability and use of common military platforms.

China’s protests

While Australia pulled out from the grouping a decade ago after China’s protests at the time, India’s hesitation in reinviting it back to the exercises in the past few years was also understood to be over China’s sensitivities over a possible “military alliance” in the Indo-Pacific ranged against it. However, experts believe that growing concerns in both countries over China’s aggression in the Indo-Pacific and on the border with India have accelerated the pace of Quad cooperation this year.

When asked if New Delhi’s turnaround this year was due to the stand-off at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and tensions with China, Mr. O’Farrell said that the decision was a reaction to “challenges in the neighbourhood” over a period of time, not the last few months.

“I don’t think the invitation came about because of activities over the last couple of months [at the LAC], I think it's been the changing environment in which we live, and the recognition by countries like India and Australia, that they have to step up in the neighbourhood to deliver the sort of world we want,” he noted.

However, Mr. O’Farrell said Australia’s policy did not envision formalising the Quad in any way, contrary to statements from U.S. State department officials, who called for formalising and regularising the interactions on the platform. He said that Australia did not see the Quad, as U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo asserted, as a “tool” to counter the challenge from China’s ruling Communist Party (CCP).

Positive agenda

“We have a positive agenda for the Quad, which is about shaping the neighbourhood in which we live, you know, a free, open and resilient Indo- Pacific, one where, you know, rules and norms apply and one where any disputes are resolved according to international law. It's been clear in the comments of the three foreign ministers, who are three-quarters of the Quad, that whatever we develop there is intended to be shared by all countries across the Indo Pacific, so we're not exclusivist,” he stated.

India and Australia would continue talks on a trade deal, although they would be delayed until after the 15-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was completed later this year, which India decided to walk out from. Despite several requests from RCEP countries, especially Australia, the Modi government has refused to reconsider its decision, citing worries over Chinese goods flooding the Indian market.

“RCEP will proceed. I understand and recognize and respect India's decision, and no one is forced to sign up to the agreement. It’s no secret that Australia was keen for India to be part of it. In the meantime, Australia will continue to engage with India bilaterally on a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA),” he said.

Full text of interview

It was a “mistake” for Australia to have walked out of the Quad and the Malabar exercise in 2008, says Australian High Commissioner Barry O’Farrell, as he welcomed India’s decision to invite Australia back to the exercises in November with the US and Japan.

The Quad foreign ministers meeting in Tokyo was followed up by India’s announcement that Australia has been invited to join the Malabar naval exercise this year. Would you say that as an arrangement, the quadrilateral between Australia-India-Japan-US is now on its way to being formalized?

I think it’s an evolving forum that, you know, brings like-minded democracies together, by looking at issues to work to work on common issues in the neighbourhood like maritime security, cyber, and in counter-terrorism. And as we saw [at the FM meet] is it’s moved into areas, you know, looking at vaccines, looking at maritime issues, looking at supply chains, critical minerals. So, it continues to be a diplomatic forum to discuss a shared outlook and shared interests within our region. It's not and I don't think it's planned to be a formal structure. But it will continue to see close partners come together to discuss common interests and outlooks and work on those for this region.

US Secretary of State Pompeo said that actually, he believes the Quad should collaborate to counter what he called the coercion by the Chinese Communist Party. How does Australia see the purpose of the Quad?

Well, as my Foreign Minister [Marise Payne] has said, and I'm very happy to quote her: We have a positive agenda for the quad, which is about shaping the neighbourhood in which we live, you know, a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific, one where, you know, rules and norms apply one where sovereign independence applies, and one where any disputes are resolved, according to international law. All I know is when the four foreign ministers get together, they are increasingly working collaboratively, aligning ourselves on issues that that are important to our neighbourhood at a time of unprecedented challenges, including the COVID challenge.

You said the Quad was a grouping of like-minded democracies, does that mean that certain (non-democratic) countries are disqualified from a future Indo-Pacific arrangement and which countries might join in the future?

We talk about people that share a vision. But we also make clear that ASEAN-led infrastructure is essential to the future of all the Indo-Pacific and in no way are we seeking to circumvent that. And critical to the resilient supply chain initiative that India, Australia and Japan have had discussions around. And it’s been clear in the comments of the three foreign ministers, who are three quarters of the Quad, that whatever we develop, there is intended to be shared by all countries across the Indo- Pacific, so we're not exclusivist.

After years of requests from Canberra, India has finally agreed to invite Australia to the Malabar exercise. Why do you think it took so long?

You know, we all know that Australia withdrew from the Quad [In 2008, Australia pulled out of the Quad and Malabar exercise. From 2017 onwards, after the revival of the Quad, the Australian government had requested India to rejoin the exercises].I can say that, with the benefit of hindsight,clearly that it was a mistake. I suspect earlier in the piece, that became a stumbling block, and that was not forgotten in terms of reassembling Australia as part of that exercise. The good news is that that hasn’t stopped over the past six years, a quadrupling of the defence cooperation between India and Australia. I think that while there was this focus on for a number of years, whether or not Australia would be invited to rejoin the Quad. But that missed what was going on in the defence relationship. The AUSINDEX exercise last year was the largest joint exercise Australia has ever participated in. It was also the most complex involving submarine to submarine serials and P-8 maritime patrols across the Bay of Bengal. Now that is far bigger than any previous Malabar exercise. I haven’t seen yet the scope for the two-part Malabar plan for next month, but we clearly welcome the opportunity to participate Malabar. It is a further sign of the deepening of the defence relationship between Australia and India. Whichever way you look at it, Malabar is a good thing. It'll enhance our capabilities in working with three close partners in the Indo-Pacific to deliver stability and security in the Pacific. But beyond Malabar, there has been a whole lot of work that I think is just as important, and in some instances more important than the Malabar. So, I'm delighted that that we've got past the Malabar [question] because we can, we can we can reflect on the broad, deeper defence relationship between our two countries and, and find ways to further extend those.

Do you think New Delhi’s current concerns at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China played a part in its decision?

My view is that, you know, this was this was an invitation to be issued to Australia, not for Australia to demand of the other three partners. You know, it was their gift. I think there’s no doubt that over the last couple of years, given the increased challenges within the neighbourhood, the increased competition within the neighbourhood, that we probably all looked around and decided to work together with people that that have not just shared values, but also a shared vision for the region. I don’t think the invitation came about because of activities over the last couple of months [at the LAC], I think it's been the changing environment in which we live,and the recognition by countries like India and Australia, that they have to step up in the neighbourhood to deliver the sort of world we want.

To turn to trade, despite repeated requests from other countries, including Australia, India has made it clear it will not join the 15-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Will RCEP go ahead, minus India, later this year?

Well, I think it’s clear from what’s been said today that RCEP will proceed, and that’s a good thing. That's a good thing for the for the region. But as we’re seeing in this, in this current world, you can have relationships at many levels. External Affairs Minister Jaishankar talks about “plurilateralism”, and it’s right, that there will be a variety of relationships. So, my view is RCEP will proceed. I understand and recognise and respect India’s decision, and no one is forced to sign up to the agreement. It’s no secret that Australia was keen on India to be a part of it. But you know, what’s happened has happened. What’s expected to happen later this year will occur. In the meantime, Australia will continue to engage with India bilaterally on a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).

But won’t bilateral trade take a back seat to trade between the RCEP nations, once that agreement is in place?

Australia will continue to look at putting effort in growing trade ties between India and Australia, regardless of what is happening elsewhere. You know, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. And my point is that given what COVID-19 has done to economies across the globe, given what it’s doing to economies within the region, I am convinced that Australia’s efforts to engage India in increased trade and commerce and importantly, investment will continue apace alongside our efforts with the rest of the world and the rest of the neighbourhood.

India’s objections on RCEP weren’t just to Chinese goods flooding the market, there were specific differences with Australia on Agriculture and Dairy product access. Can the two countries overcome bilaterally what they couldn’t multilaterally?

I think sometimes it’s easier to do it bilaterally than in a multilateral forum, because you're looking for the agreement of two people, as opposed to 15 or 16. I am optimistic, and some of that optimism comes from pomegranates. In August, Indian pomegranates were allowed into the Australian market for the first time. I know that we have made progress in some of the agricultural sectors, with some of the non-tariff barriers that had existed, I only see benefit in those things continuing forward. Do I believe there is going to be a breakthrough overnight? No, my view of life is that most things take time to work out. Now, whether it’s Make in India or Atmanirbhar Bharat, Australia has elements that can assist India to achieve its economic vision. If India wants to succeed with its renewable energy mission with its batteries with its electric vehicles, Australia can offer a reliable source of the rare earths and the critical minerals that are required to deliver that mission. We already have in Macquarie infrastructure group, the largest investor in Indian infrastructure in the world. That’s an Australian company. We have the seventh largest pool of managed funds, our pension funds, and only on the eighth of October, we had a virtual interaction between six of our largest pension funds and the national investment in infrastructure fund on the opportunities that exist in India.

How much do you think the coronavirus challenge is going to actually be a driver of relations?

I think it’s increased the opportunities. I recently met with, with your health minister, and one of the observations that he made that I’d already picked up from a couple of southern Indian investors was that both Australia and India during COVID-19 have accelerated the rollout of telemedicine digital health. And, you know, we’re both big countries, you’re a big country with a big population. We are a big country with a lot of remote areas with small communities, in both those countries, tele-health, digital medicine are important. The biggest lesson out of COVID-19 is in the non-medical area, which is the need for resilient supply chains, and for other reasons, also recognising the need for diversification of markets.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ipyifo/article32932663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FARRELL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-mistake-to-have-walked-out-of-quad-malabar-exercise-in-2008-australian-envoy-barry-ofarrell/article32931294.ece
62,2020/10/23,Coronavirus | Next 3 months key to containing COVID-19: Harsh Vardhan,"India inching towards recovery rate of 90% , says Health Minister

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Friday the next three months are going to be decisive in determining the trajectory of COVID-19 for the country.

“If we take adequate precaution and follow COVID appropriate behaviour in the coming festival and winter season, we will be in a better position to fight corona,” the Minister said while reviewing COVID-19 preparedness and measures for COVID-appropriate behaviour in Uttar Pradesh.

The Minister said India has shown improvement over the last three months and “from recording over 95,000 COVID-cases in a day, the cases have been substantially reduced to less than 55,000 cases in a day. The Recovery Rate of India is nearing 90%. The Case Fatality Rate is also declining. CFR stands at 1.51% and is moving towards the target of having CFR less than 1%”, Dr Vardhan said.

He further added, “The number of active cases are less than 7 lakh and the doubling rate has increased to 97.2 days, as of now. The journey which started from having just one lab, we have come a long way in now having nearly 2,000 labs in the country. The number of total tests conducted across the country have surpassed 10 crore. This is a positive indication that we are moving in the right direction.”

For Uttar Pradesh Dr. Vardhan stressed that there is a need to focus on increasing testing, surveillance, contact tracing, and early diagnosis to keep fatality rate low.

Meanwhile, India has conducted a total of 10 crore (10,01,13,085) COVID-19 tests on Friday while conducting 14,42,722 tests on Thursday alone. The last one crore tests were conducted in nine days.

“The country’s testing capacities have multiplied manifold with nearly 2000 labs across the country and with collaborative efforts of the Centre and State/UT governments. More than 15 lakh samples can be tested every day,” said a release issued by the Health Ministry.

It added that progressive countrywide expansion in testing infrastructure has played a crucial role in the steep rise of testing numbers. “With 1,989 testing labs in the country including 1,122 government laboratories and 867 private laboratories, the daily testing capacity has got a substantial boost,” it said.

The Ministry added that higher testing across wide regions has resulted in early identification of positive cases, prompt tracking through efficient surveillance and tracing, and timely & effective treatment in homes/facilities and in hospitals for the severe cases.

65,2020/10/23,"India needs to fix domestic issues to win respect abroad, says Tharoor","He said it was important for India to come across to the rest of the world as an example of a thriving and harmonious society.

Underlining that India has been more of a “rule taker” than a “rule maker” at the UN, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Friday said the country needs to fix its domestic issues, including that of the economy, and have “moral authority” if it wants to be a rules contributor to the world.

The former Union minister said he has always argued that India’s international credibility is often a reflection of its domestic postures and the success at home is the best guarantee that “we will be respected and effective abroad”.

“Now we have unfortunately been going through a few very bad years domestically in terms of crumbling social cohesion, the eruption and uncontrollable spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the border troubles with China, the economic collapse after demonetisation, unemployment figures worst recorded in the history in these years, everything is wrong,” he said at a session of the 7th national forum of the Public Affairs Forum of India.

Mr. Tharoor said India must use its capacity to demand constructive changes in global governance.

“India has to be what it was trying to be before the last five years or so which was a sort of an example to the developing world -- the world’s first development power,” the former UN Under Secretary General said.

Mr. Tharoor hoped that India would contribute to initiatives to catalyse a new consensus for the world.

“But before it does so, we really have to fix our internal situation first so that we can face the world with greater credibility and with renewed admiration that we used to enjoy till very recently,” he said.

Asked about reforms at the UN and whether they were linked with monetary contributions by member states, Mr. Tharoor said, “I don’t think cheque book alone is important.”

India is a state that has contributed generously and was among the leading donors to UN’s democracy fund, initiatives on ideas, decolonisation, racism, apartheid, and also also contributed in kind through peacekeeping, Mr. Tharoor said.

“India has nothing to be ashamed of, we have very much been at the forefront of international efforts at the UN to do a lot of good work and to contribute in terms of leadership. Yet, we have been more of a ‘rule taker’ than a ‘rule maker’ and these rules have been made by the big powerful countries and we haven’t been counted amongst them,” he said.

“Which is why we need both economic growth and prosperity on the one hand, which has gone down the tubes in the last few years, and we also need moral authority if we want to be a rule contributor,” Mr. Tharoor said.

That moral authority comes from the successful management of our own challenges including the great challenges of religious, ethnic and linguistic diversity in India which the country had been managing very well till recently, he said

It also involves managing some of the contradictions in the neighbourhood and being magnanimous to neighbours rather than being hostile to them, Mr. Tharoor said, claiming that India had slipped on that count recently.

Mr. Tharoor said it was important for India to come across to the rest of the world as an example of a thriving and harmonious society.

“If we can get our act together and lead our country in the direction that we have traditionally aspired to — that has been hailed as a success in the past, we will once again be in a position to set an example whether on the Security Council or off it,” he said.

“If India does this and also prospers economically, people from other countries will state that they cannot imagine a Security Council without India “rather than us demanding it as we are doing it now,” Mr. Tharoor said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qn7ue2/article32407568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHASHITHAROOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-needs-to-fix-domestic-issues-to-win-respect-abroad-says-tharoor/article32929343.ece
66,2020/10/23,Centre curbs stock limits to cool onion prices,"First imposition of limits after amendment to Essential Commodities Act.

With onion prices crossing ₹100 per kg in several cities, the Centre imposed stock limits on wholesalers and retailers until the end of the year to prevent hoarding. This is the first time stock limits have been imposed on any commodity after the Essential Commodities Act was amended last month to reduce such interventions.

Under the curbs, wholesale traders will not be allowed to store more than 25 tonnes of onions, while retailers will be limited to two tonnes only, from October 23 till December 31.

“We want to send a strong message that the government will not allow hoarding and price manipulation to hurt the ordinary consumer,” Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan told journalists on Friday. “Storage has to be such as meets current requirement; it should not be hoarded in expectation of a possible future price spike.”

String of measures

Onion prices have been rising steadily since early September, and the Centre has already slapped an export ban on the staple vegetable, taken steps to facilitate imports from other countries, and released more than 40,000 tonnes from its buffer stock of one lakh tonnes into retail markets to cool down prices.

Prices are always high at this time of year as stocks from the last rabi crop dwindle before the fresh kharif crop begins to arrive. However, excess rainfall and flooding in the key producer States of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh this year has resulted in significant damage to the standing kharif crop, and the expectation of short supplies has led to soaring prices, crossing the ₹100 per kg mark in Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad.

Nationally, the average retail price is more than ₹55 per kg as on October 21. This is only 22% higher than last year, when excess rainfall had similarly affected crops, damaged onions in warehouses and caused transport disruptions. However, the price is 115% higher than the average of the last five years for this date, which triggers the “extraordinary price rise” clause of the amended Essential Commodities Act, allowing the government to invoke stock limits.

The Act was amended by Parliament last month to reduce government regulation and encourage traders and investors to build warehousing and supply chain infrastructure without worrying about being raided on suspicions of hoarding. The Centre had also promised that farmers’ income would rise through the move.

Farmers unhappy

Although consumers will be relieved by the stock limits imposed on onions, farmers groups are not happy.

“When prices go up, the government immediately steps in to intervene. But when the price goes down to ₹5 and ₹10/kg in February and March, will they step in to help farmers then,” asked Vijay Jawandia, Maharashtra-based farmer and activist.

The untimely rains had not only destroyed the standing crop, but also seedlings in the nurseries, meaning that onion seed prices are now reigning at a record high of ₹5000/kg, in comparison to the usual rate of ₹1000/kg, Mr. Jawandia said.

“One must understand that natural calamities happen, and the farmer cannot always bear the whole burden. It is only farmers who suffer, never consumers. If one does not eat onion for a month or two because prices are high, one is not going to die,” he added suggesting that the government intervention was due to the upcoming Bihar polls, with onion prices, especially on the eve of festival season, having become a political issue in the last few years.

67,2020/10/23,Parliament panel mulls action against Amazon,"The e-commerce giant has declined to depose before the Joint Committee of Parliament that is examining the draft Data Protection Bill.

Facebook India’s policy head Ankhi Das on Friday appeared before the Joint Committee of Parliament that is examining the draft Data Protection Bill. However, e-commerce giant Amazon declined to depose before the panel on October 28, stating that its “subjects experts” cannot take the risk of traveling from the U.S. during the coronavirus pandemic.

Stating that Amazon’s “refusal” amounts to a breach of parliamentary privilege, BJP MP and chairperson of the JPC, Meenakshi Lekhi, told reporters that the panel was unanimous about taking “coercive action” if no one from the company appears next Wednesday.

Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, Google and Paytm are among the companies from whom the committee has sought views on data security and protection amid concerns that the privacy of users is being “compromised” for commercial interest. The panel questioned Facebook India’s representatives, including Ms. Das, who has been in the eye of a storm over reports of alleged bias towards the BJP and refusal to apply hate speech rules to a BJP politician.

She was recently in the eye of a political storm after an investigative report in an international publication accused her of “bias towards the ruling BJP by refusing to apply the company’s hate speech rules to a BJP politician”.

The discussions within the JPC, however, were strictly confined to the Data Protection Bill.

Facebook India executives were asked whether they obtain the consent of its users before their data is shared with third parties, a source said.

“They told the panel that Facebook does sell data but arrived at inferences based on user behaviour. So, we asked them if they obtain the consent of the users even to do this,”a JPC member told The Hindu.

Members of the parliamentary panel, cutting across party lines, also asked the social media giant about its decision-making process, revenue model, method of paying taxes, advertisers and the process of choosing target audience for these advertisers, background verification of its users including the process to find out the age of a new user.

During the meeting, a member suggested FB India should not share ‘inferential data’ of its users for commercial benefits of its advertisers.

When FB India executives pointed out that some of the matters are sub judice, a senior Opposition MP is learnt to have said the Committee was examining a new law and was well within its remit to seek information related to it.

“We don’t buy such an arguments as the courts don’t make law. The JPC is an extension of Parliament and is helping in the process of making a new law,” another member of the panel said.

The 30-member joint committee, headed by Ms. Lekhi, includes senior members like Bhupender Yadav (BJP), Congress’ Jairam Ramesh, Manish Tewari, Trinamool’s Derek O Brien and Mahua Moitra, DMK’s Kanimozhi among others.

While matters relating to catering arrangements in the Parliament House Complex are typically decided by a joint committee on food management, in the 17th Lok Sabha, however, the food committee has not been constituted.

The final decision was taken by Speaker Birla, who has taken personal interest in ensuring that better quality food is served in the canteen and also to end subsidies.

72,2020/10/23,Northern Railways to launch ‘Bags on Wheels’ to ferry passenger luggage,"Passengers can avail this app-based service to carry their lugguage from home to train coach and vice-versa at a nominal cost.

Passengers travelling from Delhi, Ghaziabad and Gurugram will be the first to avail the soon-to-begin ‘Bags on Wheels’ service of the Railways through which their luggage will be transported to their homes from the railway station upon their arrival in trains and vice versa.

The Northern Railways’ Delhi Division on Friday announced the ‘App-Based Bags on Wheels’, a first of its kind service available for railway passengers in India. While the contract has been awarded, the services are expected to begin soon.

Initially, the firm to which the contract is awarded will provide its services for the passengers boarding trains from New Delhi, Delhi Jn., Hazrat Nizamuddin, Delhi Cantt., Delhi Sarai Rohilla, Ghaziabad and Gurgaon railway stations, a statement from the Northern Railway said.

While officials said the cost of availing these services will be nominal, the price will depend on the distance to be covered as well as the weight and quantity of the luggage to be carried.

“The service will enhance the scope of earning for Railways with straightaway Non-Fare Revenue of ₹50 lakh per annum along with 10 per cent revenue sharing for the period of one year,” it said.

The firm will provide door-to-door service to railway passengers on a nominal fee for hassle-free and smooth handling and transportation of luggage from the passenger’s home to the passenger’s coach in the train and vice-versa.

Rajiv Chaudhry, General Manager Northern and North Central Railways, said the Railways has been regularly striving to enhance its revenue through innovative ideas.

“Working in the same direction, Delhi division has recently achieved a milestone by awarding a new innovative contract under New Innovative Non Fare Revenue Ideas Scheme (NINFRIS) for App-Based Bags-on-Wheels services. It would be the first of its kind service available for the railway passengers in India,” he said.

Using BOW APP (will be available for Android & iPhone users), passengers will raise their demand for carrying their luggage to railway station or to their home. Luggage will be picked up by the contractor in a secured manner and will be delivered to the coach/home as per booking preference of passenger, he said.

It would be very helpful for passengers, especially senior citizens, differently-abled and women passengers travelling alone, Mr. Chaudhry said.

The unique feature of this service would be that the delivery of the luggage would be ensured prior to departure of the train to provide ease of travelling experience to passengers,” the statement said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/surhgr/article32926232.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN23TRAINBAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/northern-railways-to-launch-bags-on-wheels-to-ferry-passenger-luggage/article32925804.ece

Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D. Raja speaks to The Hindu about his party’s decision to be part of Mahagatbandhan, the decline of the CPI in Bihar and opinion polls.

In 1995, the CPI had 26 seats, it was the fourth biggest party in the Bihar Assembly and now you are reduced to fighting six seats. How do you explain such a decline?

It is true, we used to win a good number of seats in the State Assembly and Parliamentary elections. Over the years, many developments have taken place. It is not only an issue that is staring at the Left in Bihar. But we continue to be force to reckon with, especially when it is about protecting the interests of the people, particularly the poor and marginalised sections. We are a force to shape the political discourse. As far as our decline is concerned, we could not be part of a viable coalition for various reasons. But now things are different, we are part of Mahagatbandhan and provide a viable alternative in Bihar.

Why did the CPI decide to join the Mahagatbandhan?

Earlier, when Lalu Prasad Yadav was Chief Minister, we fought Assembly and Parliamentary elections together. It was only [for the] last general elections, despite our efforts, we could not reach an alliance. Similarly, in 2015 also, we could not have an alliance. But now, taking into consideration the situation in the country and Bihar, we came to the conclusion that the primary objective must be to defeat the BJP and its allies. All secular democratic forces need to come together for this goal. Now, the BJP-RSS combine has posed a grave threat to the Constitution, democratic polity of our country and secular fabric of our society. Our country and the Constitution need to be saved. This election will have larger ramifications in the future political course of the country as a whole.

You are a Communist leader who comes from a Dalit family. Do you believe this election sees an end to the Mandal-Kamandal era?

The Bihar election will be the beginning and rebuilding of the assertion of Dalits, backward classes and marginalised sections. The BJP has become too aggressive to promote their neo-liberal agenda. They are trying to hand over the whole economy to private hands. It means the government is abdicating all its responsibility. As far as caste-based politics is concerned, what is caste-based politics? What happened in Hathras? In India, we have a caste system, which is why B.R. Ambedkar gave a call for ‘annihilation of caste’. It is a long-drawn battle against caste system and patriarchy, which we will continue to fight.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked four Railway officials and two top functionaries of a private company for allegedly causing a loss of crores to the exchequer by tampering with bills raised against the execution of work contracts.

The accused officials have been identified as the then deputy chief engineer S.P. Deshmukh, assistant executive engineer (Construction) Pradip Kumar Sharma, assistant finance adviser Tapeswar Rabha and one Bimal Dey. Nayak Infrastructure Private Limited’s managing director Ananta Charan Nayak and director Biswajit Nayak have also been named.

It is alleged that the Price Variation Contract (PVC) bills of works along the Silchar-Sairang Line under the North-East Frontier Railway was manipulated and excess payments made to the contractor for projects related to construction of tunnels, bridges and other allied works.

During a sample check of the PVC bills passed by the Silchar Construction Unit, senior Railway officials found that bills related to seven works were indeed tampered with, allegedly in collusion with the engineers and officials of the Finance Department (Construction) in Silchar and Maligaon.

The FIR alleges that the company had submitted forged bills by prefixing digit ‘1’ to the actual amounts. A bill for over ₹1.80 crore was allegedly changed to ₹11.80 crore, another bill for more than ₹2.92 crore became over ₹12.92 crore. Eight such instances were detected.

While it is not clear if all such bills were cleared, the FIR mentions that some accused officials had made recommendations for payments against various bills.

India and Bangladesh are negotiating the modalities for hosting the long-delayed meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission, an official said here on Thursday. Anurag Srivastava, official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said the plan for the meeting is on course as envisaged by the Sixth Joint Consultative Commission meeting held on September 29.

“During the recently held Joint Consultative Commission meeting between the two Foreign Ministers, they urged the concerned authorities to consider convening the ministerial level JRC meeting. I understand both sides are in discussion on this,” said Mr. Srivastava.

78,2020/10/23,EC says it has cleared policy related promises in poll manifestos in past,"Political parties raised questions on BJP’s poll promise of free vaccine for Bihar, alleging that it is politicising the matter

Amid demand by some opposition leaders for action by the Election Commission against BJP’s manifesto promising free coronavirus vaccine in Bihar, officials on Thursday pointed out that the poll panel had allowed policy related promises made by various political parties, including the Congress, in the past.

Officials did not reply directly to the specific issue of BJP’s Bihar election manifesto promising free coronavirus vaccine, but referred to EC’s official stand when it had received complaint against the Congress’ ‘Nyay Yojna’ during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The Commission had not found the scheme violative of the model code. It had also said that the scheme did seem to have come under the domain of corrupt practices as enshrined in the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday released the BJP manifesto for the Bihar Assembly polls which promised free COVID-19 vaccine once it has been cleared by the ICMR.

The officials also referred to a clause in Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act which deals with corrupt practices.

A provision of section 123 says that “declaration of public policy, or a promise of publication, or the mere exercise of a legal right without intent to interfere with an electoral right, shall not be deemed to be interference within the meaning of this clause”.

Opposition parties on Thursday slammed the BJP for promising free COVID-19 vaccines in its Bihar poll manifesto and demanded action by the EC, while alleging that the ruling party was using the pandemic for political gains.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took a swipe at the BJP, saying one has to refer to the state-wise election schedule to know when one will have access to the vaccine.

The BJP, however, said health is a state subject and its manifesto is for Bihar, not for the entire country, where it has promised that the state will buy the vaccine for its people.

82,2020/10/23,Farm meters will sound the death knell for YSRCP govt.: Lokesh,"‘Relief for farmers who lost standing crop due to rains paltry’

Farmers of Anantapur district will take the lead in revolting against the State government’s policies, according to TDP national general secretary N. Lokesh.

Addressing the media at Gooty in the district on Friday, after visiting the fields where farmers had lost standing crops due to heavy rains, Mr. Lokesh said the plan to fix smart meters to the farm connections would sound the death knell for the YSRC government, and warned the State against going ahead with its plan.

Flaying the government for releasing a paltry ₹39 crore towards providing relief to the farmers, he said the amount was insufficient even for one mandal.

“Groundnut farmers, who cultivated the crop in 10 lakh acres, alone will require ₹2,000 crore,” Mr. Lokesh observed.

Accusing the government of reacting only after the Opposition pointed to the loopholes in the system, or shoddy implementation of projects, Mr Lokesh said, “In the last 15 months, not a single farmer received input subsidy, drip irrigation tools, interest-free loan, or crop insurance. No Minister or MLA is available for review of the situation. Andhra Pradesh is in an absolute state of paralysis,” he said.

Advice to Jagan

Referring to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s claim of being a ‘Rayalaseema bidda’, Mr. Lokesh wondered where he had gone when the Rayalaseema farmers were in distress.

Over 750 farmers had taken the extreme step in the last 15 months, he said, and advised the Chief Minister to undertake a ‘padayatra’ again to take stock of the situation under his rule.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/oqig6h/article32933199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24VJPG4-LOKESH2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/farm-meters-will-sound-the-death-knell-for-ysrcp-govt-lokesh/article32933200.ece

87,2020/10/23,Chief Minister seeks banks’ support,"Adequate financial aid sought for farm sector, welfare schemes

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has requested the State-Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) to provide loans amounting to ₹1,87,550 crore to the priority sector and ₹64,050 crore to the non-priority sectors in the financial year 2020-21 as targeted (total ₹2,51,600 crore).

The loans required by the agriculture and MSME sectors have been pegged at ₹1,28,660 crore and ₹39,600 crore respectively.

Participating in the 212th SLBC meeting at his camp office on Friday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy sought adequate financial support from the banks to the agriculture sector and welfare schemes.

He stated that the farm sector was the backbone of the economy on which 62% of the population was dependent for their livelihood and that the banks should fulfil their mandate by giving loans and supporting the farmers through other means.

He stressed the need for banks to help in the implementation of YSR Rythu Bharosa and PM Kisan, and pointed out that crop loans provided during 2020-21 kharif season were ₹3,000 crore less than the loans given in the corresponding period last year. In this regard, the banks should get their act together, the Chief Minister suggested.

Price stabilisation fund

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the government created a price stabilisation fund of ₹3,500 crore for procuring various agricultural commodities when the prices plummet due to vagaries of the market.

He requested the banks to support the cold storage network and establishment of Janata Bazaars.

The Chief Minister asked the banks to help in augmenting the infrastructure in government hospitals and schools under the Nadu-Nedu programme. A major step towards improving the healthcare sector was the setting up of 16 new teaching hospitals. Besides, village clinics were planned to be set up to take healthcare services to the people's doorstep. The government contemplated to spend ₹13,000 crore on the health sector in the coming three years.

The banks should also facilitate the implementation of ‘Jagananna Thodu’ which is scheduled to be launched in November. Interest-free loans were planned to be extended to petty businessmen under that scheme.

Also, the Chief Minister requested the banks' support for the revival of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises which were badly hit by COVID, and to extend a helping hand to self-help groups.

Ministers Mekapati Goutham Reddy and K. Kannababu, Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, SLBC president G. Raj Kiran Rai and convener V.

96,2020/10/23,Sanitation key to preventing transmission of poliomyelitis,"Humans only known reservoirs of the virus

Poliomyelitis is a viral disease that mainly affects children under five years of age. Polio, once an endemic disease with devastating results like paralysis, was eradicated from India in 2014 due to consistent efforts of the Government of India and partners of global polio eradication initiative like the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF and Rotary International.

The virus mainly invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis. In most of the cases (90-95%), the infection is inapparent and would induce protective immunity, while paralytic polio occurs in less than 1 in 1,000 infected children, said Dr. Maruthi Prasad Upputuri, consultant paediatrician, KIMS ICON Hospital, in connection with World Polio Day on October 24.

Polioviruses are spread by the faecal-oral route, which is why environmental sanitation plays a vital role in preventing transmission. Humans are the only known reservoirs of polio virus and thus even if a single child remains infected with polio virus, children in all countries are at risk of contracting polio.

Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries left with endemic transmission. These being our neighbors, India should be on high alert. The rejection of poliovirus vaccine initiatives and campaign quality in security-compromised areas in parts of these countries are the major difficulties faced in eradication, he says.

Vaccination is the only effective method of preventing poliomyelitis. Both IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) and OPV (oral polio vaccine) have established efficacy in preventing poliomyelitis and paralytic polio. Every child should be given four doses of IPV at 6, 10, 14 weeks of life and 15-18 months. OPV is to be received at birth and also on pulse polio immunisation days.

Once polio is eradicated, the world can celebrate the delivery of a major global public good that will benefit all people equally, no matter where they live. Most importantly, success will mean that no child will ever again suffer the terrible effects of lifelong polio-paralysis, Dr. Maruthi Prasad said.

Curator of Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (IGZP) Nandani Salaria refuted rumours that the IGZP stood first among 10 zoos across the country to be selected for development along the lines of international standards.

According to Ms. Salaria, a few months ago, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) had chosen IGZP along with nine other zoos in the country for being upgraded as a world-class zoo with a 10-year vision plan.

Ms. Salaria said that the aim behind the move is to bring the standards concerning animal upkeep, staff welfare and visitor amenities on par with world-class zoos. She said that the zoo was chosen after a series of presentations and online meetings with the officials from CZA.

“We had given presentations on various trends and opportunities that the IGZP has. We explained about the scenic location, topography and the natural setting that the zoo provides, as well as the threats and challenges faced by it. After taking everything into consideration, the officials selected 10 zoo parks including Vizag zoo,” she said.

She also clarified that there is no ranking system of the 10 selected zoos. “Each zoo has its own strengths, challenges and opportunities which they need to work out,” she said.

Ms Salaria added that CZA has chosen a consultant who will be visiting IGZP to help them prepare a 10-year vision plan.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) V. Suresh Babu and ACP Ch. Penta Rao arrived at the scene to oversee the investigation. A CLUES team did a thorough inspection of the area.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Suresh Babu said the miscreants used gas cutters to prise the ATM open and access the cash compartment. “There is no security guard at the ATM kiosk. At around 9 p.m. on Wednesday, a customer came to the ATM and left as the machine was not working due to technical failure. However, there was cash inside the machine. According to bank records, he was the last customer,” Mr. Suresh Babu said, adding that the CCTV camera was disconnected.

A case has been registered and an investigation is on to nab the miscreants, police said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/miscreants-loot-atm-flee-with-9-lakh-cash/article32922774.ece

102,2020/10/23,City numismatist adds rare coins to his kitty,"B. Ravi Shankar Reddy’s unique collection throws light on turning points in India’s history

Collection of currency, including coins, paper currency and souvenirs, has been his hobby for several years. His kitty has several rare coins and they are his proud possession. B. Ravi Shankar Reddy, a numismatist and philatelist of the city, has now added new coins to his collection — commemorative coins of ₹75, ₹350 and ₹550.

Commemorative coins are issued to mark special occasions and give a brief history and significance of the subject, place or event on which they are brought out, apart from details of the composition of the metal or metals, its characteristics and weight, says the avid coin collector and philatelist.

The ₹75 coin was issued to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the First Flag Hoisting Day on December 30, 2018. The coin has themes of the Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, along with the hoisting of the first Tricolour by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. It epitomises the spirit of the struggle for independence, when Netaji declared the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as the first Indian territory to be freed from the British Raj.

The ₹350 coin was issued to commemorate the 350th Prakash Utsav of Sri Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Sikh Guru, who was born on December 22, 1666. He had founded the new spiritual order known as ‘Khalsa’ in 1699.

The ₹555 coin was issued to mark the 550th Prakash Purab of Sri Guru Nanak Dev, founder of Sikhism. His 550th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the world on November 12, 2019. Guru Nanak’s hymns were compiled in book form, which was subsequently published as ‘Adi Granth’. He started free community kitchens, through which his followers, irrespective of their caste and religion, were encouraged to eat together.

“I had registered with the Mumbai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad mints. No announcement is made by the mints before issuing the commemorative coins and we have to keep checking online. It takes six months to two years to get the coin after it is released,” says Mr. Reddy.

“I purchased the ₹75 and ₹350 coins for ₹2,844 and ₹2,985 respectively from the Mumbai Mint and ₹550 coin for ₹2600 from the Kolkata Mint,” he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/city-numismatist-adds-rare-coins-to-his-kitty/article32922766.ece

105,2020/10/23,Missing spark: lukewarm response from applicants to set up temporary firecracker stalls,"Only around 200 applications received so far, says official

There are not many takers for licences to set up temporary stalls for the sale of crakers on the occasion of Deepavali on November 14. Only around 200 applications were received so far.

According to Regional Fire Officer (RFO), GVMC, Niranjan Reddy, about 150 applications were received for setting up stalls at Andhra University Engineering Grounds, nearly 25 applications were received to set up stalls at NTR Grounds, Anakapalle. Apart from them, another 20 received for setting up shops in other places in the GVMC limits.

“Compared to last year, when we started to receive applications in the first 10 days, the response is lukewarm. But we have some more days time. May be a few more may come forward after Dasara,” he said.

He said that in 2019, the total applications received for setting up firecracker stalls under the GVMC limits was around 350.

On October 8, Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha invited applications for stalls and also made it clear that no application will be entertained after October 25. The applicants were asked to take No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from the district authorities, Fire Officer, GVMC, electricity site plan and temporary shop/shops agreement from the owner of the land. A licence fee of ₹500 also to be paid through treasury challan. The Police Commissioner also issued a set of rules for setting up of shops.

According to the Police and Fire Department sources, many associations are yet to take a decision due to the COVID-19 situation and unavailability of several grounds. Temporary rythu bazaars have been set up in several grounds to avoid overcrowding. Meanwhile, the Fire Department officials have strictly said that they would not allow any stalls near the road.

“Generally, many applications used to be received to set up stalls at MVP Colony and some other places. But this year as some of those grounds are already occupied, not many came forward. May be the associations are looking for spots which are feasible for their business,” said a senior police officer from the city.

The district officials are also mulling increasing the number of sale days to avoid overcrowding. Till last year, the authorities used to give only three days for sale of crackers. This year, the authorities may increase the number of days. However, a final decision is yet to be taken.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/missing-spark-lukewarm-response-from-applicants-to-set-up-temporary-firecracker-stalls/article32922723.ece

110,2020/10/23,Army chief commissions INS Kavaratti,"It is the last of the four indigenously built Anti-Submarine Warfare stealth corvettes

INS Kavaratti, the last of the four indigenously built Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) stealth corvettes built under Project 28 (Kamorta class), by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), Kolkata, was formally inducted into the Indian Navy at the Naval Dockyard in Eastern Naval Command, here on Thursday.

It was commissioned into the Indian Navy by General Manoj Mukund Naravane, Chief of the Army Staff, in the presence of Vice-Admiral Atul Kumar Jain, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command (ENC), Rear Admiral Vipin Kumar Saxena (Retd), CMD, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Limited, Kolkata, and other dignitaries

The ship, named after the capital of the Lakshadweep group of islands, has been constructed using high-grade DMR 249A steel produced in India.

The ship spans 109 metres in length, 14 metres in breadth with a displacement of 3300 tonnes and is regarded as one of the most potent Anti-Submarine Warships to have been constructed in India. It joins three other ships of the same class INS Kamorta, INS Kadmatt and INS Kiltan, at the ENC. Experts say that the induction of the ASW corvettes will be a game changer in the eastern seaboard, especially with the Chinese submarines trying to make sorties in the Indian Ocean.

With the superstructure built using composite material, the ship is propelled by four diesel engines. The ship has enhanced stealth features resulting in reduced Radar Cross Section (RCS) achieved by X form of superstructure along with optimally sloped surfaces. The ship’s advanced stealth features make her less susceptible to detection by the enemy.

The ship has high indigenous content with the state-of-the-art equipment and systems to fight in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare conditions. Also, the weapons and sensors suite onboard is pre-dominantly indigenous. Some of the major equipment/ systems developed indigenously include Combat Management System, Torpedo Tube Launchers and Infra-Red Signature Suppression System and etc.

Other advanced automation systems include Total Atmospheric Control System (TACS), Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), Integrated Bridge System (IBS), Battle Damage Control System (BDCS) and Personnel Locator System (PLS).

Having completed sea trials of all her equipment, Kavaratti has been commissioned as a fully combat-ready platform providing a boost to the ASW capability of the Indian Navy.

The ship is manned by a team comprising twelve officers and 134 sailors with Commander Sandeep Singh at the helm as her first Commanding Officer. The ship would be an integral part of the Eastern Fleet under the Eastern Naval Command.

The ship is the reincarnation of the erstwhile Arnala Class missile corvette of the same name (INS Kavaratti – P 80), a ship that outlived her life span and played a stellar role in Liberation of Bangladesh in 1971.

Earlier, Gen.l Naravane was presented a guard of honour on arrival at the Naval Jetty. The inaugural address was delivered by Rear Admiral Saxena (Retd), CMD, GRSE, Kolkata. Vice Admiral Atul Kumar Jain, FOC-in-C, ENC, addressed the gathering which was followed by reading out the Commissioning Warrant of the Ship by the Commanding Officer, Commander Sandeep Singh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3frgqu/article32922550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJKAVARATTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/army-chief-commissions-ins-kavaratti/article32922551.ece

112,2020/10/23,Bhagyalakshmi scheme changed attitude towards girl child among poor: Report,"‘It has also reduced gender disparity in school attendance’

The BJP government’s flagship Bhagyalakshmi scheme, a welfare measure linked to the conditional cash transfer in the name of the girl child, has changed the attitude towards the girl child among the poor sections of society and reduced gender disparity in school attendance, according to an evaluation report.

Evaluation of the implementation of the scheme during 2010–11 and 2015–16 by the Karnataka Evaluation Authority with the support of Hyderabad–Karnataka Centre for Advanced Learning, Kalaburagi, found that “85.5% respondents believe there is a changed attitude towards the girl child in society” and that “they are no more considered as burden”.

The scheme was launched in 2006–07 to improve the status of girl children by promoting education among below the poverty line (BPL) families. Registration of the birth of a girl child was 100% among the scheme beneficiaries with the intervention from anganwadi, ANM, and ASHA workers.

School attendance

The report said 88% of children aged between six and 17 were attending school; there was “almost no gender disparity” in school attendance in the six to 14 age group. But there is a marginal difference in the 15 to 17 age group (73% of girls attending school as against 75% of boys). “Some portion of this success can be attributed to the scheme,” it said.

Evaluation of the implementation of scheme in eight districts — Bengaluru Urban, Chitradurga, Dharwad, Vijayapura, Bidar, Raichur, Dakshina Kannada, and Chamarajanagar — found reduction in the visibility of child labour in commercial activities to a significant extent. District child rights cells, Labour Department, and child rights activists also contributed to this factor, it said.

On the flip side

Interestingly, the report noted, “With 18 years of age and minimum eighth standard education, the scheme looks somewhat marriage oriented.”

Although the scheme has increased the value of the girl child marginally within the poor family, it has failed to curb female foeticide as it is prevalent across the class and caste categories, the report stated.

“Among the minorities and certain tribal communities, there is reservation on religious lines on the issue of sterilisation,” it stated.

The report recommended that scheme beneficiaries should be given priority under various skill development as well as self-employment schemes.

“The very process of allocation of BPL status needs to be relooked as the presence of bogus beneficiaries are blocking the potential of genuine beneficiaries,” the report stated.

Increase in age limit

Considering a majority of parents (76.7%) use the Bhagyalakshmi scheme money for marriage purpose when the girl child attains the age of 18, the State Cabinet, on Thursday, seems to have increased the age limit to 21 for withdrawal of the full amount under the scheme.

The remodelled scheme allows for withdrawal of a portion of the total amount of ₹1.27 lakh to be withdrawn at the age of 18 for pursuing education and the remaining at 21 years, said Minister for Women and Child Development Shashikala A. Jolle.

After shifting the execution of the scheme from LIC to India Post, the government would deposit ₹3,000 each in the name of the child for 15 years under the Sukanya Samriddhi scheme account. Currently, there are 30.5 lakh beneficiaries.

OPTIONAL CUT: Earlier, the government used to pay a premium of ₹19,350 for the first child and ₹18,350 for the second, to the LIC. The LIC refused to implement the scheme owing to low premiums.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/f358wi/article32933216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGSCHEME2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bhagyalakshmi-scheme-changed-attitude-towards-girl-child-among-poor-report/article32933217.ece
113,2020/10/23,Vishwanath: Not right to include vaccine issue in manifesto,"A.H. Vishwanath, BJP MLC, has taken exception to the BJP manifesto for the Bihar Assembly election promising free vaccination for COVID-19.

Joining the chorus questioning the election promise, Mr. Vishwanath wondered whether the logical extension of the poll promise means people would be allowed to die if the party does not win. “If you don’t win, will you let the people die?” he wondered aloud while speaking to reporters here on Friday.

He criticised the inclusion of the promise to give free vaccination in the BJP’s poll agenda. “No, this (issue of providing vaccination) should not enter the manifesto of any political party or become part of the party’s agenda in the elections,” said Mr. Vishwanath, who was among the 17 MLAs who quit the erstwhile JD(S)–Congress coalition and helped the BJP form the government in the State.

Mr. Vishwanath was also critical of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami for making a similar promise of providing free vaccination to all the people of the State, which is expected to go to polls next year.

Mr. Vishwanath also decried the language used by the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah against BJP leader Nalin Kumar Kateel.

State honorary president of the sangha Chamaras Malipatil, who led the farmers in a march, begged for alms and collected money from the public from the Teen Kandil area to the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Raichur.

He said that the Union government has become bankrupt and hence unable to attend to the grievances of the general public and farmers of the State, particularly those in the Kalyan Karnataka Region which had faced huge losses due to recent rain and floods.

Several hundreds of property and standing crops in several thousands of agriculture land have been destroyed in a natural disaster. However, the Union government has not released sufficient relief funds to be distributed among the victims.

“We have lost faith in the government in terms of compensation that has to be distributed to farmers and the public who have lost crops and property. Therefore, we decided to donate some money to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund and collected ₹ 5,019 by begging for alms.

Members of the Veera Kesari Amatoor Balappa Yuva Sene and the Samasta Hanabara Yadava Samaj Sanghagala Okkoota took out the rally to the Deputy Commissioner’s office and shouted slogans against the government.

They said that Amatoor Balappa had fought along side Rani Channamma who repulsed the British attack on the Kittur Fort in the 19th century. He was as great a warrior as Rani Channamma and Sangolli Rayanna. However, due to political reasons, successive governments have neglected the contribution of Amatoor Balappa. There is not a single memorial in his native village of Amatoor or Kittur or Belagavi.

There are no lessons on his life in school textbooks. This is unacceptable, they said.

They demanded that a statue of Amatoor Balappa be put up in Belagavi and a prominent traffic circle be named after him in the city. They also demanded that the State government form a development corporation for Hanabar, Yadav, Golla and other synonymous communities.

With only a couple of days left for campaigning for the election to the Karnataka West Graduates Constituency, Janata Dal (Secular) has decided to withdraw from the contest and announce support to the Independent candidate Basavaraj Gurikar.

Addressing presspersons here on Friday, former Minister and JD(S) leader Basavaraj Horatti said that after the date of the announcement of the election, the party could not get in touch with the electorate in four districts and following a direction from party supremo H.D. Deve Gowda and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, the party candidate for the constituency had withdrawn from the contest.

Mr. Horatti clarified that in order to maintain equidistance from Congress and BJP, the party had decided to support the candidature of Mr. Basavaraj Gurikar.

To a query, he clarified that withdrawing from the contest after having begun campaigning would not do any damage to the party’s image. He clarified that decision was taken after careful consideration of the poll scenario.

JD(S) candidate Shivashankar Kallur clarified that as a loyal worker of the party, he had withdrawn from the contest following a decision taken by Mr. Horatti and the party leadership. He said he had never betrayed his party and would abide by the party’s decision.

118,2020/10/23,Karnataka HC suggests law imposing death penalty for gang rape,"Upholds trial court’s verdict of life term for offenders; appreciates law student’s fight against culprits

The High Court of Karnataka has suggested that a law be framed at the national level prescribing death penalty for the gang rape of women.

The court made the observation while upholding the life imprisonment imposed by the trial court on seven convicted persons, who had gang-raped a 21-year-old law student near Jnana Bharathi campus in the city on October 13, 2012.

“She [the victim] had boldly lodged a complaint at 1.30 a.m. in order to ‘protect Dharma’. Her ‘tolerance’ and ‘courage’ to proceed against the accused in accordance with the law ... and for fighting the legal battle against the accused to get justice in an unfortunate incident in her life has to be appreciated,” the court observed.

“Between Nirbhaya’s case and the present case, the only difference is that in the case of Nirbhaya, the victim died after the brutal attack on her, but in the present case, the victim has discontinued her law course and returned to her native country — Nepal — with all curse,” a Division Bench, comprising Justice B. Veerappa and Justice K. Natarajan, observed and added that gang rape was more dangerous than murder.

The Bench upheld the fast-track court’s September 6, 2013 verdict of convicting Ramu, Shivanna, Maddura, Eleyaiah alias Eleya, Eeraiah alias Eera, Raja, all from Metaridoddi village in Ramanagaram district, and Dodda Eeraiah alias Doddeera of Hebbala village of Hunsur in Mysuru district. They had raped her one after the other after dragging her out of the car in which she was chatting with her friend around 9.30 p.m. in Jnana Bharathi police station limits.

“It is surprising to note that when victims of rape in modern India are admonished by society, the Vedic society was much more supportive of survivors of rape,” the Bench, said quoting from the Vedas and Manusmriti.

Observing that “we are not proud to say that India achieved empowerment of woman even after seven decades of Independence,” the Bench recalled Mahatma Gandhi’s quote, which said, “The day a woman can walk freely on the roads at night, that day we can say that India has achieved independence.”

To ensure that society respects women’s dignity at all levels, the Bench felt that a child should be taught to respect women in society and gender equality should be made a part of the school curriculum along with personality-building and skill-enhancing exercises apart from watching children on their behavioural pattern to sensitise them.

The Bench also said the government, educational institutions, the media, and employers must take steps to create awareness to respect women.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/n3jomo/article32823401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10KRAKARHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-hc-suggests-law-imposing-death-penalty-for-gang-rape/article32923262.ece
119,2020/10/23,New SWM policy aims to achieve 100% segregation at source,"The State government on Thursday approved the Karnataka State Urban Solid Waste Management (SWM) Policy-2020 and the Urban Solid Waste Management Strategy-2020. The new policy has an ambitious target of achieving 100% segregation at source of solid waste in all urban local bodies across the State. The new policy also aims to reduce waste going to landfills to less than 30% of the total waste generated by 2025.

The policy was prepared by the Directorate of Municipal Administration in compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and is applicable to all ULBs in the State.

According to the policy, most of the ULBs in the State spent maximum portion of their overall budget for waste management on collection and transportation of solid waste.

“Often, less than 10% of the budget is spent on treatment, processing, and final disposal of solid waste. Proper processing, including recycling facilities, do not exist in most ULBs in Karnataka and therefore, majority of the waste is being taken to unscientific disposal sites for dumping,” the document stated.

The new policy calls for focus and effort on segregation of waste and proper processing of waste. However, biomedical waste, e-waste, faecal sludge and sewage, construction and demolition waste, and industrial waste have not been covered under the new policy as they do not fall under the scope of SWM Rules, 2016.

The zero-waste initiative, ‘Namma Kasa Namma Javabdhari’, will be implemented across the State along with awareness campaigns on the practice of reduce, reuse, recycle (3Rs).",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-swm-policy-aims-to-achieve-100-segregation-at-source/article32923168.ece

121,2020/10/23,‘Centre should take stern stand against Telangana’,"‘It should not allow Krishna waters issue to be raised before a fresh tribunal’

The Union government should not yield to the demand by Telangana for redistribution of Krishna waters by a new river water disputes resolution tribunal, Congress leader and former Irrigation Minister H.K. Patil said in Hubballi on Thursday.

The Centre seems to be taking a soft stand towards Telangana in the matter. This is not a positive development. This could lead to very serious negative implications for Karnataka. The Centre should take a stern stand against the demand by Telangana and not allow the issue to be raised before a fresh tribunal, he told journalists.

‘Clarify stand’

He urged the Centre to clarify its stand on the issue. He demanded that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa take a delegation to the Centre asking it to reject Telangana’s demad.

Floods

Mr. Patil criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union government for failing to protect the interests of Karnataka in several issues, including responding to natural calamities in the State.

“Since last year, Karnataka has suffered several calamities. Hundreds of rural families have lost their bread winners, farmers have lost crops and cattle and houses of countless poor families have collapsed. The State has suffered losses of more than ₹ 40,000 crore last year, while this year’s losses are yet to be calculated. I believe crops over 10 lakh hectares have been damaged and the losses add up to ₹ 35,000-₹ 40,000 crore. People are suffering due to the unprecedented rainfall and water release from dams. But the Centre’s response has been discouraging. They have given only a fraction of what the State asked for. Mr. Modi should release adequate compensation to Karnataka,” he said.

He faulted the State government for what he called callous attitude towards floods in North Karnataka. Officers are negligent towards their duty of establishing relief centres and caring for people lodged there. In several flood-hit villages, officers are yet to open relief centres. This should stop. Mr. Yediyurappa should issue a strict warning to officers and see that they carry out flood relief operations in a proper manner.

Polls

He said that the Congress was poised to win all the six Legislative Council seats as people were upset with the BJP that had not fulfilled any of its promises.

“I am travelling with other Congress leaders to collect the opinion of graduates and other enlightened citizens. I see that most of them are disappointed. They feel betrayed by Mr. Modi on his poll-time promises that he never kept. They are asking what happened to the promise of creation of two crore jobs and reducing corruption. People feel bad about voting for the BJP and want to support the Congress in the coming polls,” he said.

“The issue we need to focus on now is to conduct the survey and distribute compensation to the flood victims at the earliest. The poor may survive on their wages. But, they cannot get houses built on their own. The houses that were undermined in the floods may collapse in about 15 days. Enough care should be taken in conducting the survey,” he said.

“Though conducting crop loss survey may be difficult at this stage, the administration needs to monitor the situation for the next 15 days and start the survey. I am going to randomly check the work. All the officials in the district shall get actively involved in the task. All officers should involve themselves in the survey work in such a way that people should feel assured of them getting fair compensation,” Mr. Karjol said.

“As people are showing little interest in using public transport on major routes owing to COVID-19 and as prices offered by the private players on major routes are relatively lesser than that offered by NEKRTC, the 10 % additional charge imposed on these routes during the weekend is withdrawn to attract more passengers,” he said.

127,2020/10/23,GESCOM yet to restore power supply in three flood-hit villages in Kalaburagi,"The State-owned undertaking has successfully corrected power disruptions elsewhere in the region

Though Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company (GESCOM), a State-owned undertaking entrusted with the responsibility of supplying electricity in the six districts of Kalyana Karnataka region, has successfully corrected power disruptions caused by heavy floods, three villages are yet to get power supply.

Speaking to The Hindu on Thursday, GESCOM Chief Engineer Laxman Chauhan said that Mandarwada, Kobal and Raddewadagi villages in Jewargi taluk that were completely flooded for days on end are yet to get electricity supply restored.

“Many electricity polls have fallen and transformers are damaged. The ground around the village is too wet to walk on and take up repair work. We are waiting for the ground to get dry and hard for taking up repair and restoration work,” he said. According to the officer, 2,154 electricity polls have fallen and 1,093 transformers submerged in the floodwaters across Kalaburagi district. In Yadgir district, 325 electricity polls have fallen and 267 transformers are submerged.

“Meanwhile, most of the fallen electricity polls have been restored to their original position in the two districts. As for flood-hit transformers, we cannot say all of them have been destroyed. Some may function properly and some may have to be replaced. We are checking them,” he said.

When asked, the officer said that GESCOM had enough transformers to replace defunct ones.

To a query on demand and supply of electricity, Mr. Chauhan said that power procurement was surplus in GESCOM.

In a memorandum, samiti president Lakshman Dasti and vedike president Sunil Kulkarni stated that though the Union government had announced the Railway Divisional headquarters in Kalaburagi in 2014 and a detailed project report given approval and the required land allocated to Indian Railways, the Railway Division still remains a distant dream.

At present, the region is served by three railway zones — Central Railways, South Central Railways and and South Western Railways; and five divisions — Solapur, Guntakal, Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Hubballi.

“As the region is divided into various zones and divisions, it is difficult to get train facilities. To get one new train facility started from the region, we have to get approval from various divisions and zone offices,” Mr. Kulkarni added.

The other demands included the starting of festival special express train between Solapur and Hassan and to resume the Kalaburagi-Hyderabad Inter-city express that was cancelled during the lockdown.

Vedike unhappy

Kalyana Karnataka Grahakara Vedike also expressed displeasure over the manner in which Mr. Mittal conducted the inspection.

130,2020/10/23,Sira hots up as big forces descend on turf,"While rivalry between Cong. and JD(S) in Vokkaliga heartland remains, BJP is trying to make inroads

Once an important military outpost for the Mughals in south India, Sira in Tumakuru district is witnessing a fierce political battle in the byelection arena now. In the field are a veteran fighting to retain his party’s turf, a young and politically ambitious leader looking to send a message, and a newly anointed party chief keen to prove his mettle.

The octogenarian Janata Dal (Secular) leader, H.D. Deve Gowda, is camping in Sira to ensure the party’s victory while B.Y. Vijayendra, son of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, has been in the constituency for over 10 days now. Congress leaders D.K. Shivakumar and the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, according to sources, will be seen more often in the constituency.

While the traditional rivalry between the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) in this Vokkaliga turf remains, the BJP is trying to make inroads into the Vokkaliga heartland after its victory in K.R. Pet constituency in Mandya during the bypolls in December last. With just over 10 days left for the polling on November 3, the constituency has seen heightened political activity, though the outcome has no consequence on the BJP government in the State.

JD(S) national president H.D. Deve Gowda with party candidate Ammajamma in Sira.

The entry of Mr. Gowda to the electoral fight, party sources said, comes at a “politically important juncture” for the party that is anxious about retaining its identity as a regional player, and to prevent a repeat of K.R. Pet bypoll results. The party derives its strength from Tumakuru and Mandya districts, and losses here could progressively erode the party’s base, sources said. The former Prime Minister on Thursday told the “BJP youth leader” (Mr. Vijayendra) that Sira is not K.R. Pet to take the JD(S) lightly.

“Loss in Sira could have a long-term impact on the party, which has a strong base in Tumakuru district. He does not want to let it go and see its impact in the next elections,” sources said.

Mr. Gowda has not been involved so closely in a constituency in recent years, sources said.

On the other, Mr. Vijayendra, BJP vice-president, has been working in the constituency, approaching leaders and voters at the booth level. “The BJP does not have a great base here. A victory for the BJP in Sira on the lines of K.R. Pet could send a political message since it is also not a Lingayat-dominated constituency. It will help build the young leader an image outside Lingayat politics,” sources said. Mr. Vijayendra’s presence, however, has been marked by Opposition’s allegations of distribution of money to woo voters, a charge he has dismissed as stemming from “frustration”.

For KPCC president Mr. Shivakumar, who is being seen in a covert struggle for Vokkaliga leadership with JD(S) leaders, the bypoll in the Vokkaliga heartland is an opportunity to prove his capacity. It is also his first electoral outing after taking over as chief of the State party unit. Sources close to him said a victory in Sira and R.R.

While Karnataka is seeing a heightened demand for re-engineering the reservation matrix, with Kuruba community demanding the Scheduled Tribe (ST) tag and Valmiki community seeking a hike in overall ST reservation quota, any inclusion and exclusion from quota is a legally and politically fraught issue, experts say.

For starters, the State government is yet to accept the socio-economic survey (caste census) report, which can provide ground for redrawing quota, even as many caste groups, especially Lingayats and Vokkaligas, are critical of the census methodology and outcome itself. Meanwhile, already on the table is H.N. Nagamohan Das Committee Report that recommends a hike in reservation for STs by 4%, taking it to 7%, and for Scheduled Castes (SCs) by 2%, taking it to 17%, in proportion to their population. If Kurubas are to be declared ST as per their demand, the quota for STs will have to be proportionally increased.

Also Read Caste fault lines re-emerge amidst political ferment

Breaching limit

The larger issue is also that the State has already hit the apex court set 50% cap on reservation and any hike poses a challenge. Seniors in the backward classes movement argue that the socio-economic survey should be the basis for reconstitution of the matrix, essentially demanding that communities that have progressed since availing of benefits be stripped of them to accommodate others who continue to be “backward”. This argument is particularly aimed at the Vokkaligas and Lingayats. However, leaders of these communities say they are prepared for even a legal challenge, depending on the outcome of the caste census.

Any attempt to push communities out of quota would face a big challenge. “Other backward classes (OBCs) make up about 52% of the State’s population, but enjoy 32% reservation. So any cut further is unfair and politically fraught,” said a senior OBC leader from the BJP.

This leaves the State government with the only option of increasing the quota beyond 50%, a recommendation by the Nagamohan Das committee as well.

One way out is through a Bill to increase reservation beyond the 50% limit passed in Parliament and including it under the IX Schedule of the Constitution, putting it beyond judicial review, like in the case of Tamil Nadu, experts said. However, some legal experts say this can be done at the State level. “Indira Sawhney judgment of the apex court that caps quota at 50% also says this can be relaxed in exceptional circumstances, The State government can use this argument,” said a retired Karnataka High Court judge.

C.S. Dwarakanath, former chairman of the Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission, argues for a complete reconstitution of the matrix based on the caste census. “There is no scientific rationale for classification of communities under various categories for reservation. This has only meant the dominant castes within the category enjoying all benefits at the cost of smaller communities,” he said.

Complex procedure

There are also complex procedural issues in including any community in the ST list. The Union government has to pass a Bill in the Lok Sabha and the President of India must give his assent. Given the complexity, the government may not be willing to do that right now, said many.

“Kurubas are essentially shepherds who are there in every State, though their names may vary. Any attempt by the Union government to list Kurubas in Karnataka as ST will only have a snowball effect across the country. Other STs are unlikely to quietly accommodate such a large community in their quota bracket,” said a senior OBC leader.

He added that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, while under pressure to respond to these demands, is unlikely to “touch the beehive”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fkk8df/article32922735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGKURUBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/redrawing-quota-a-politically-legally-fraught-issue/article32922736.ece

134,2020/10/23,KSBB bid to restore biodiversity along the Pampa river,"2018 floods had hit riparian vegetation

A gritty attempt is being made to restore scores of plant species which the destructive floods of 2018 ‘stole’ from the banks of the Pampa river.

The floods had severely impacted riparian vegetation across Kerala, leading to large-scale destruction of many local flora found along the river banks. Now, with the help of local panchayats, the Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSBB) is attempting to set a model for the State by restoring the biodiversity on the banks of the Pampa in Pathanamthitta district.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the green initiative, a component of the Rebuild Kerala Initiative, on October 27.

Ninety-four riverine species, including threatened ones, will be restored along the banks of the river as part of the programme. An attempt to identify the species that were lost was made in consultation with the local panchayats. The species are also ones which offer natural protection to river banks, KSBB officials said.

The project will cover 92.95 km of river banks in all and ten grama panchayats under three blocks in Pathanamthitta district. The following panchayats under Elanthoor, Koippuram, and Ranni blocks — which appeared to be the worst-hit in terms of biodiversity degradation — will be covered: Cherukole, Kozhancherry, Ayiroor, Ranni, Ranni-Pazhavangadi, Ranni-Angadi, Ranni-Perunad, Vadasserikkara, Vechoochira and Narannamoozhi.

The plants and trees will be grown in nurseries and planted on the banks of the Pampa, which was one of the rivers which faced severe biodiversity destruction in the floods.

“'The project is being undertaken in collaboration with the panchayats. The idea is to create a model which can be followed elsewhere in the State,” a KSBB official said.

The massive undertaking was designed on the basis of studies carried by the KSBB as well as other departments. For instance, the ‘Concise Report on Biodiversity Loss due to 2018 Flood in Kerala’ prepared by the KSBB had assessed the impact on the riparian vegetation along Kerala rivers, including the Pampa.

“It was recorded that 771 landscapes, including riverine, forest, plantations and agriculture fields (across Kerala), were severely affected due to the 2018 floods. Available data with respect to loss of species revealed that approximately 287 varieties of agricultural crops, 1,053 flora, and 695 fauna were either lost or exiled,” the KSBB noted in the introduction to the report.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ksbb-bid-to-restore-biodiversity-along-the-pampa-river/article32933164.ece
135,2020/10/23,Gap Road works hang in balance,"Uncertainty over compensation to farmers, safety measures

The widening works of the Gap Road stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi national highway hang in the balance with uncertainty over safety measures and an agreement on compensation yet to be reached with farmers who had suffered losses in landslips triggered by the blasting of rocks.

As many as 30 farmers had suffered losses after cardamom cultivation in nearly 50 acres was destroyed in landslips on June 17 and August 7.

K.B. Baby, a farmer who lost cardamom in 11 acres, said the farmers would not agree unless a proper compensation was given by the contractor. He said there was an official report that the damage was widespread and proper compensation be given to the farmers.

Inconclusive

A meeting convened by the District Collector was inconclusive as only a meagre compensation was offered by the contractor, he said adding that the Collector, who visited the spot, had assured them that the works would not be allowed unless they were given proper compensation.

Vinod Chandrasekharan, who lost 3.5 acres of cardamom, said the compensation offered by the contractor was ₹2 lakh per acre. “Not only the crop but also the land had been lost and how can one agree to such a package. If the price of beans and the cost of maintaining plants alone are taken into consideration, farmers could have suffered a loss of at least ₹15 lakh a year in terms of cardamom production,” he said adding that as the land itself was lost, they either needed proper compensation or alternative land for cultivation.

Nearly 300 metres of road was washed away in the first landslip.

There were reports that unscientific road widening works and blasting of rocks over a wide area could have triggered the landslips.

It is estimated that nearly 20 landslips had occurred on the Gap Road stretch since the road widening works began in 2018.

A report by the Devikulam Subcollector had cited unscientific roadworks for landslips on the stretch.

Recommended

An expert team which visited the landslip area had recommended that the works should be restarted only after ensuring safety measures, including construction of retaining walls.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gap-road-works-hang-in-balance/article32933137.ece

139,2020/10/23,COVID-19 case graph shows levelling off trend in Kerala,"8,511 new cases in State when 64,789 samples were tested in 24 hours

The State’s COVID-19 case graph continued to show the levelling off trend on Friday also and reported 8,511 new cases when 64,789 samples were tested in the past 24 hours.

The test positivity rate seemed more or less stabilised at 13.13%.

There were 6,118 recoveries, taking the total to 2,80,793.

While the cumulative case burden has gone up to 3,77,834 cases, the active case pool, which seemed to be inching towards the three-lakh mark two weeks ago, never quite reached there because of the good number of daily recoveries. The number of active cases now is 95,657.

Of the active cases, 841 are critically ill and are being treated in ICUs with 224 patients requiring ventilator support.

The number of deaths on Friday was 26. This takes the cumulative death toll to 1,281.

Of the 26 deaths, Alappuzha reported seven, Kottayam five, Thiruvananthapuram four, Kozhikode three, two each by Kannur, Kollam and Ernakulam and Thrissur one.

140,2020/10/23,CPI(M) predicts mutiny in Cong. over right-wing drift,"Political trading with RSS and WPI ahead of elections

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] on Friday indicated that a revolt was imminent in the Congress over the party’s overtures to radical outfits.

CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who chaired a meeting of the party secretariat here, told newspersons that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) was inclined to accommodate the rebels to advance its secular and progressive political agenda in the face of the increased polarisation of society on communal lines.

The political line of the Congress in the State was in stark variance with that of its national leadership. Congress leader Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan had held secretly parleys with the RSS leadership in Kottayam even as the Congress fought the Sangh Parivar at the national level.

United Democratic Front (UDF) convener M.M. Hassan entertained the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami Amir M.I. Abdul Aziz in Malappuram. He also engaged the Welfare Party of India (WPI) leadership in secret negotiations.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had sided with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to target the LDF government by rejecting the statement of Rahul Gandhi that Kerala had admirably managed the COVID-19 pandemic triggered public health crisis.

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) had capitulated to the Jamaat-e-Islami. It supported the decision of the Turkey government to change the status of the iconic Hagia Sophia in Istanbul from a historical museum to a mosque to appease the Islamists.

The UDF also planned to shift votes to the BJP in at least 10 constituencies as it did in Nemom in 2016. The alliance hoped to whittle down the prospects of the LDF in the Assembly elections in 2021 by aligning with radical forces. By attempting to deny the LDF enough seats to form a government, the UDF hoped to create a ruling alliance with the tacit support of fundamentalist Islamic movements and Hindu majoritarian forces.

The situation demanded the LDF mustered secular forces to its side ahead of the polls.

CBI ban

The meeting also highlighted the need to curb the CBI from launching suo motto investigations in Kerala. Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal have withdrawn the carte blanche given to the CBI to probe cases that fall under the legal purview of the local law enforcement.

Kerala also required to do so provided that the BJP has destroyed the credibility of the agency by using it as a political tool against its detractors.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpim-predicts-mutiny-in-cong-over-right-wing-drift/article32931522.ece
141,2020/10/23,State intervenes as onion prices surge,"It enhances orders placed for consignments from 75 tonnes to 200 tonnes

With onion prices going through the roof, the State government has enhanced the orders placed for onion consignments from 75 tonnes to 200 tonnes as part of a frantic market intervention effort.

The first consignment of 25 tonnes, from Maharashtra, has already arrived in the State. Of this, 10 tonnes, intended for the northern districts, were offloaded at Ernakulam. The remaining 15 tonnes were brought to the Agriculture Department’s World Market at Anayara in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday for distribution in the southern districts.

The onions would be sold at ₹45 a kilo through outlets of the Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp), Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar said.

After prices surged to as much as ₹120 per kg, the State government had placed orders for 75 tonnes to the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd via Horticorp. But given the situation in the market, this had been enhanced to 200 tonnes, Horticorp managing director J. Sajeev said.

142,2020/10/23,Strict norms in place for access to fuel stations,"The guidelines are based on the report of the expert committee

Stringent norms are in place for the issuance of licence for access to fuel stations from the State Highways (SH) and Major District Roads (MDRs) in the State.

The guidelines for access permission to fuel stations and stipulations for ensuing road safety had been worked out by the Public Works Department since the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) IRC: 12-2016 Unified Guidelines for access permission to fuel stations was withdrawn by the Union government with effect from December 1, 2019.

The guidelines are based on the report of the expert committee headed by Chief Engineer, Roads, Ajith Ramachandran and Ashok Kumar, Chief Engineer (NH), Darlene Carmelita D’cruz, Chief Engineer (KSTP), and Roji Jacob Alex, Executive Engineer, RSW, as members.

The person or entities that apply for access licence will have to submit a self-certified proposal for obtaining access permission to the Highway Authority-Executive Engineer, Roads, PWD to whom the highway is entrusted.

On breach of any of the condition imposed by the Highway Authority, the officer authorised by such authority on its behalf will terminate the licence. However, before any such action is taken, a notice will be issued to the fuel station licencee concerned describing the violation and non-compliance of such conditions, giving him an opportunity to rectify the anomalies within a reasonable time, not exceeding 60 days from the date of issue of such a notice.

The fuel company can construct the fuel station as per the approved drawings at their own cost within 12 months from the date of issue of provisional permission for access. After the construction, the applicant may apply online for issue of the final permission for access.

The fuel companies shall have to enter into an agreement for signing the licence deed for access permission from SH & MDR for 15 years with the Highway Authority. The licence for access permission will be issued to the fuel company on payment of ₹3 lakh (for SH) and ₹2 lakh (for MDR) as one-time licence fee. The licence fee and all other fees, penalties etc. mentioned will be increased 5% every year.

All existing fuel stations will have to apply with documents for regularising the licence within one year and will also have to pay ₹3 lakh (SH) and ₹2 lakh (MDR) as one-time fee. However, the new guidelines will not be applicable to fuel stations that were given licence previously by the PWD, before guidelines came into force.

The Highway Authority will keep a register of record of fuel station for which access permission has been granted. This will also be regularly updated on PWD website. Site specifications and safety norms has been spelled out in detail.

The norms, notified by the government, are applicable to all the fuel stations and service stations along all categories of SH and MDRs under the PWD. Necessary amendments will also be made in the PWD manual to this effect.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/strict-norms-in-place-for-access-to-fuel-stations/article32931439.ece

144,2020/10/23,NIA failed to prove terror link: court,"Two accused in diplomatic channel gold smuggling case get bail

The National Investigation Agency (NIA), after 100 days of investigation, could not bring up evidences in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case to show that the accused had any links with any terrorist forces, observed the NIA Special Court, Kochi.

Releasing two accused Hamzath Abdussalam and T.M. Samju on bail, NIA Special Judge P. Krishnakumar said there was nothing in the case diary to prove that the money spent by the accused in the case came from any terror outfits or they received the gold for transmitting it to any such dark forces.

The court had earlier granted bail for 10 other accused in the case. Perusing the case diary, the judge noted that the NIA could only establish that the petitioners funded the front-line accused for smuggling gold using the diplomatic channel and they conspired with the others for the purpose.

However, there were sufficient materials to show that the duo had conspired with some of the accused persons to smuggle gold to India, the judge noted.

The court said that even though the petitioners acted with an intention to damage the economic security of the country, there was no material in the case diary to prima facie satisfy that they did it with such an intention.

The offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), which was invoked against the accused, stand only if they directly or indirectly raise funds from or provides it to any person knowingly that such funds were likely to be used by a terrorist. So far, there was no evidence to prima facie show that the said offence was made out, the order said.

The mere act of smuggling gold would not attract the offence of terrorist act, unless it was coupled with certain other elements, which at least suggest the broad probability of an intentional act to threaten the economic security of the nation, the judge added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nia-failed-to-prove-terror-link-court/article32931347.ece

The State’s experience is that the infection can turn severe in children and the aged if they contract the disease. This being the situation, the public should heed Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s request that Vidyarambham rites should be performed at home, the Minister said.

Persons who initiate the children into the world of letters at Vidyarambham should wash their hands before and after every child performs the ritual. If gold is used to write on the child’s tongue, it should be disinfected first.

Persons who display disease symptoms should not attend the ceremony.

Ceremonies connected to Navaratri and Vidyarambham should be confined to small clusters consisting of two or three families. No such ceremonies should be carried out outside the homes in containment zones.

People above 65, pregnant women, and children below 10 should remain indoors. COVID-19 protocols such as the use of masks and sanitisers and maintaining physical distance should be observed during the ceremonies, the Minister said.

All parts of the State were under COVID-19 threat, she added. Even in districts with low caseload, the increase in infection among people aged above 60 was a matter of concern.

The construction of the first multipurpose elevated community cattle shed at Kuttanad has begun at Chembumpuram in Nedumudi grama panchayat.

The foundation stone of the structure, being constructed under the aegis of the Dairy Development Department, was laid by Minister for Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development K. Raju in a function held on Friday.

Mr. Raju said the State government was ready to give assistance to all dairy societies in the flood-prone areas of Kuttanad to construct elevated cattle sheds if they provided land. “The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government has provided help to all eligible poultry and cattle farmers at Kuttanad following bird flu outbreak and floods. Those who lost cattle in floods were provided ₹30,000 each and ₹12 crore was disbursed to duck farmers following avian influenza. Elevated cattle sheds are constructed as a permanent solution. Farmers can shift their cattle to these sheds in case of a flood situation. The structures can also be used for other purposes,” the Minister said.

Facilities

The three-storey elevated cattle shed at Chembumpuram is being built on 15 cents of land provided by the Chembumpuram Dairy Cooperative Society. The shed, with a total area of 5,496 sq ft, will have facilities to keep 100 cattle, office room, milk collection/milk testing rooms, and a conference room. A tank for collecting dung and urine of animals along with a rainwater harvesting tank will also be arranged. The government has sanctioned ₹1.8 crore for the project.

147,2020/10/23,"CPI(M) to press for JD (S), LJD merger","Leaders of both parties to meet in Kochi on Sunday

To prevent the possible wrangling over seat allocation among its allies in the Assembly polls next year , the CPI(M) has pushed for a speedy action of the proposed merger of Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) and the Janata Dal (Secular) in the State.

As a follow up to the earlier talks which remained deadlocked, it is learnt that a nine-member committee comprising senior leaders of the two parties will meet in Kochi on Sunday. Incidentally, the meeting comes ahead of the three-tier local bodies polls in December.

A senior party functionary said that the merger of these two parties which are part of the Left Democratic Front ( LDF) was necessary for the smooth allocation of seats after the inclusion of the faction led by Jose K. Mani of the Kerala Congress (M) in the CPI (M)-led coalition. As such it was easy to allocate seats to a single entity rather than sharing seats to two parties.

In the 2016 Assembly polls, the LJD, which was then JD (U) had contested seven seats on the Congress-led UDF platform and drawn a blank while the JD (S) in the LDF, contested five and won from three segments. Both the parties also secured 1.5 % each of the total votes.

However, in the 2011 Assembly polls, the LJD, then SJD, had contested six seats and won from two while the JD (S), won from four seats out of the five the party contested. The SJD and JD (S) had secured 1.65 % and 1.5 % respectively of the popular votes then.

Sources said that a section of the LJD – led by its State president M. V. Shreyams Kumar favoured a merger with the JD (S), while another group is fiercely opposing the proposal which it feels would disturb the party in the long run as the JD (S) in Karnataka may have a possibility of aligning with the BJP. This comes against the backdrop of the secret talks held between JD(S) leader H. D. Kumaraswamy and Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa last month.

The merger of the LJD and the JD(S) had gained traction after the entry of the former into the ruling LDF before the Lok Sabha polls. Three rounds of discussions within a span of one-and-a-half years had also yielded no positive results though.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpim-to-press-for-jd-s-ljd-merger/article32930650.ece
148,2020/10/23,Reprieve for Bhagyalakshmi as High Court stays arrest,"Court will pronounce final decision on October 30

The arrest of dubbing artiste Bhagyalakshmi and women activists Diya Sana and Sreelakshmi Arakkal in a case related to trespassing and causing hurt to Vijay P. Nair, a YouTuber, was stayed by the Kerala High Court till October 30.

Considering the anticipatory bail application of the accused, the court asked the accused why could not the petitioners face the consequences of going into the jail as they were bold enough to barge into the lodge of the accused and bash him up.

“Why are you shying away from going to the jail. Why don't you cooperate with the investigation and face the consequences of going into the jail,” Single Judge Ashok Menon, orally observed during the course of the argument in the case.

Referring to the trial court order, which denied them bail, the court orally observed that one cannot take law into their hands, though the acts of the petitioner were nasty ones. “You have also created materials to show that you have hit him and bashed him up,” the court noted while referring to the video shot by the accused while pouring ink on him.

On the charge of theft, the counsel for Bhagyalakshmi submitted that the laptop computer and mobile phone of the petitioners were taken by them to be submitted to the police. He argued that the charges of trespass wont stand as the women were invited by Vijay P. Nair for a compromise talk and offer to delete the derogatory videos.

On the submission that Vijay P. Nair tried to outrage the modesty of the women, the court asked whether the women bashed him up on self defence.

Regarding the charge of theft, the judge noted that the element of dishonest intention was important to prove the charge. The court will pronounce its decision on the petition on October 30.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/reprieve-for-bhagyalakshmi-as-high-court-stays-arrest/article32930450.ece
149,2020/10/23,UDF for ties with regional groups,"Jose K. Mani’s exit not to affect front in elections

The United Democratic Front (UDF) high power committee on Friday decided to have electoral adjustments with regional groups and parties for the local body elections.

However, there will be no alliance with parties outside the fold of the UDF in the local body elections. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, who addressed a press conference after the committee meet here, refused to comment on whether the front would strike an alliance with the Welfare Party, the political wing of the Jamat-e-Islami, ahead of the local body and the Assembly elections.

A decision on cooperating with regional groups and parties standing against corruption and fascism would be taken at the local level, he said.

Mr. Chennithala said the decision by the Kerala Congress (M) to join the Left Democratic Front (LDF) would not have any impact on the electoral prospects of the UDF. It had become clear that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]would stoop to any level to garner votes. It is a pity that the Communist Party of India (CPI) had surrendered to the CPI(M) decision to induct Jose K. Mani into the LDF, he said.

Mr. Chennithala alleged that it had become clear that the office of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan provided all help to those involved in the gold smuggling case. Both M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, and Swapna Suresh, the key accused in the case, were trying their best to save Mr. Vijayan. The UDF will organise ‘vanchana dinam’ across all wards in the State on November 1 against the government, he said.

Mr. Chennithala pointed out that the finding by a government-appointed committee that there were lapses in the Sprinklr deal justified the position taken by the UDF against the data contract. He accused the government of trying to silence the media by amending the Police Act under the guise of checking cyber attacks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/24ih18/article32714187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAMESHCHENNITHALAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udf-for-ties-with-regional-groups/article32930225.ece

151,2020/10/23,Prosecution’s plea for time rejected in Kerala actor rape case,"Prosecutor is absent and counsel representing him is reluctant to argue, says judge

The prosecution’s application seeking time to move the Kerala High Court in the actor rape case was rejected by the Special Judge on Friday.

Honey M. Varghese, Additional Special Sessions Judge, (SPE/CBI)-3, Ernakulam, dismissed the application as the “prosecutor was absent in the case and the counsel representing him was reluctant to argue on the petition.”

The judicial officer also instructed the Investigation Officer in the case to take urgent steps for resuming the trial in view of the direction of the Supreme Court to conclude it before February 2021.

The court posted the case for November 3.

The trial in the sensational case had come to a standstill for a while after A. Sureshan, the Special Public Prosecutor, moved a petition on October 15 before the Special Judge to stop the proceedings in the case for some time to enable him to move the Kerala High Court.

In his petition, the prosecutor had complained that the trial court was acting in a biased manner, which according to him, was detrimental to the judicial system and the prosecution. He sought time to move the petition to transfer the trial to another court as he apprehended that justice would be denied to the victim in the present court.

Dismissing the petition of the prosecution, the Special Judge noted that the “absence of the Special Public Prosecutor in the court and the reluctance of the counsel who represented him were sufficient to conclude that the averments in the petition were dubious and baseless.”

Though the prosecution had repeated the argument that a petition for change of court was being moved on Friday, no steps seemed to have been taken in that direction, the judge noted.

Actor Dileep is one of the accused in the case. He has been accused of conspiracy, while the others are accused of abducting and raping an actor in a moving car.

The Investigation Officer in the case sought time to file a report on the direction from the court regarding the absence of the prosecutor in the court.

Of the six witnesses who were scheduled to appear before the court on Friday, four did not turn up. The two who were willing to depose were directed to appear before the court when summoned again.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/prosecutions-plea-for-time-rejected-in-kerala-actor-rape-case/article32928404.ece
152,2020/10/23,Kerala police open probe into organ transplant racket,"IG said middlemen working for hospitals had “deceptively induced” persons from needy families.

The State police have stumbled upon an organ transplant racket that supplied kidneys and liver tissue from living donors to affluent patients for sizeable sums of money.

IG, Crime Branch, S. Sreejith, who conducted the preliminary enquiry, has recommended the registration of a First Information Report (FIR) to kickstart a criminal investigation into the crime.

The probe is currently centred around hospitals in Thrissur district and could extend to other regions.

In a letter to the State police chief Loknath Behera, Mr. Sreejith said middlemen working for hospitals had “deceptively induced” persons from needy families to donate kidney or liver tissue to well-heeled patients requiring a transplant.

Many of the donors had no relation to the recipient. They had no connection to the donee.

The police could find no evidence to conclude the donor had any particular attachment, altruistic reason or affection for the patient.

Investigators said they suspected that the donors had received up to ₹ 10 lakh as compensation. However, the middlemen and the suspect hospitals could have netted up to 40 lakhs or more for arranging a live donor.

Mr. Sreejith’s report said that preliminary evidence pointed to the violation of section 19 of the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994. The law outlaws the sale of organs.

Investigators said the middlemen had migrated from organising blood donation for money to deceptively inducing economically disadvantaged people to donate their organs for cash.

Many of the donors could not explain the cash windfall they had received during the COVID-19 pandemic when regular employment was hard to come by.

Another official said agents working in tandem with unethical medical professionals had sought to exploit the gap between demand and supply of organs for transplants. They had found the pandemic conducive to their illegal but lucrative trade.

The Crime Branch report said that some “public servants” had “connived and abetted” the crime.

An official said government doctors could also be involved in the racket. He said the instances detected so far was just the tip of the ice-berg. The scale of the racket could be more extensive.

Deputy Inspector General of Police, Thrissur, S. Surendran will head the investigation team. Mr. Behera and Mr. Sreejith will supervise the probe.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/s15p6h/article32928171.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SSREEJITH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-police-open-probe-into-organ-transplant-racket/article32928172.ece
153,2020/10/23,Kochi-Bengaluru Industrial corridor project gets going,"Regions in Malabar will be linked to the Kochi-Palakkad stretch of the corridor in due course

The State government on Thursday signed the Share Holders and State Support Agreements with the National Industrial Corridor Development & Implementation Trust (NICDIT), a Government of India designated agency, for the Kochi-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor.

The agreements were signed in the presence of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The State Support Agreement (SSA) was signed by K. Sanjay Murthy, Chief Executive Officer of the NICDIT, and Alkesh Kumar Sharma, Additional Chief Secretary, Special Projects (Infrastructure & Industries) in charge of the Industrial Corridor projects in the State. The Share Holders Agreement (SHA) was signed by Santhosh Koshy Thomas, MD, Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Kinfra), and Mr. Murthy. Kinfra is the nodal agency of the State for implementing the project.

SPV to be formed

A special purpose vehicle (SPV) will be formed for the detailed planning, design, implementation, operation and management of the projects. There will be equal number of representatives of the State government and the NICDIT on the board of the company, which will be a 50:50 equity participation joint venture.

The Kochi-Palakkad stretch of the corridor is in the first phase of its integration. The regions in Malabar will also be linked to the corridor in due course.

Manufacturing clusters

Integrated Manufacturing Clusters (IMCs) are planned along the corridor to boost manufacturing activities, including electronics, IT, biotechnology, and life sciences, in the districts of Palakkad, Thrissur and Ernakulam in Phase I, and the districts of Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram and Kasaragod in Phase II. These require less land and are less sensitive to prices. This will also ensure higher value addition in jobs generated in the corridor region.

Mr. Murthy appreciated the support of the State government in expediting land acquisition and project development activities. “This is one of the fastest developing projects in India and I would like to thank State government for appointing senior officials in its development and implementation,” he said.

The NICDIT will provide support up to ₹3,000 crore as equity for the project and will also assist in master planning, design, engineering, EIA & environment clearance and in marketing the project to potential investors in India and abroad.

“The project is expected to attract investments in basic infrastructure development, electronic hardware manufacturing, knowledge-based industries, defence & aerospace engineering, information technology, food processing and port-based logistics development. This is a significant step towards the overall development of the State,” said Mr. Sharma.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/f4kph9/article32923013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23tv-industrial-corridorcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/industrial-corridor-project-gets-going/article32923014.ece

155,2020/10/23,Daunting task awaits CPI(M) ahead of polls,"New LDF allies may clamour for seats

A daunting task awaits the Communist Party of India (Marxist) ahead of the Assembly polls next year. It has to satisfy all its allies when seats are shared among the Left Democratic Front (LDF) constituents.

The recent entry of the Jose K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) into the front and new constituents, the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) and the Indian National League (INL), have made the task challenging for its leaders.

Sources said that the party would have to sacrifice some of the seats it had contested last time and reduce the number of seats of existing allies, including that of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Janata Dal (Secular). Last time, the CPI(M) and the CPI had contested 90 and 27 seats respectively.

Impasse over seat-sharing is likely to surface after the three-tier local body elections in December this year as the Jose K. Mani faction and the LJD have reportedly staked claim for 12 and seven seats respectively.

Bone of contention

The Jose K. Mani faction has reportedly struck a deal with the CPI(M) for at least six seats, including the contentious Pala Assembly segment which is now represented by Mani C. Kappan of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Such an arrangement is likely with an immin ent split in the NCP as the late NCP leader and former Minister Thomas Chandy’s brother Thomas K. Thomas is reportedly planning to contest from Kuttanad on the LDF ticket.

LJD

Sources said the LJD, which had contested and lost all seven seats when the party was with the United Democratic Front as Janata Dal (United) in the 2016 polls, was expected to contest at least from five segments, including Vadakara. That means the JD(S) would have to be contented with four seats.

The INL, which had been inducted into the LDF before the Lok Sabha polls, also looks forward to contesting in four seats. Last time when the party had an electoral understanding with the CPI(M)-led coalition, it contested and lost all three seats, including the Kozhikode South segment.

Minor partners

Besides, the CPI(M) has to accommodate the National Secular Conference led by P.T.A. Rahim, which had contested and won two seats — Kunnamangalam and Koduvally — last time. The other minor partners such as the Congress (S), Kerala Congress (Scaria Thomas), Kerala Congress (B), Janadhipathya Kerala Congress, Communist Marxist Party (Aravindakshan), and the Revolutionary Socialist party (Leninist) had also contested in the previous election.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/daunting-task-awaits-cpim-ahead-of-polls/article32922619.ece

Personal screen has become the new ‘big’ viewing platform for film buffs, thanks to the pandemic. Over the last few months, there have been a slew of announcements by OTT giants such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video on what is store for the future. The latest to join the bandwagon is Disney+Hotstar, which has rolled out its plans for the Tamil audience.

In a virtual press conference on Friday, Sunil Rayan, president of Disney+Hotstar, announced that the platform would be launching four exclusive shows and a movie — Mookuthi Amman — in the next couple of months. The announcement was made amidst the presence of filmmakers Venkat Prabhu, Karthik Subbaraj, RJ Balaji and actors Sathyaraj, Seetha, Kajal Aggarwal, Tamannaah Bhatia, Jai and Vani Bhojan.

Game for experimentation

Venkat Prabhu has directed a seven-episode series called Live Telecast for the platform. Going by the teaser that was released during the interaction, the series looks like a horror, a genre Venkat said he wished to experiment. “I have come out of my comfort zone. I wanted to give a different dimension to Kajal, who plays a film director in the series. Usually, a web series is written mostly for the urban audience. But I wanted to capitalise on the B and C centres,” he said, adding, “The biggest challenge when you are writing for a show is that, each episode should have an internal block towards the end.”

The series has Kajal Aggarwal, Vaibhav and Kayal Anandhi in the lead.“One of the biggest advantages of OTT platforms is experimentation. I personally have not tried acted in this genre before...I’m excited that it is finally happening.”

Sathyaraj and Seetha, the senior most among the lot, are playing a couple in a series called My Perfect Husband, directed by Thamira. Sathyaraj said, “When Thamira narrated the story, he told me that it is going to be a series [for Hotstar]. OTT is the future and as actors, it is important to adapt to the times.”

Been there, done that

Karthik Subbaraj, who just had a release on a different platform, has collaborated with Jai, Vivek Prasanna, Rajkumar and Vani Bhojan for Triples, which revolves around three friends. The director said the series would be along the lines of a Crazy Mohan comedy. “I always wished to do an out-and-out comedy and this [series] fell in the right place,” he said, while Jai added, “It will give you the feel of a Michael Madhana Kama Rajan.”

RJ Balaji made a surprise announcement that his upcoming film Mookuthi Amman, starring Nayanthara in the lead, would be the big Deepavali release on Disney+Hotstar. The film was planned for a theatrical release earlier this year but Balaji had to rethink his options, given the current circumstances. “We have seen actors such as Ramya Krishnan, Bhanupriya and Meena play the role of Amman. Now, we have the lady superstar [Nayanthara] in this role. Mookuthi Amman is a saamy film with a social message,” he said.

Balaji also added that the trailer for Mookuthi Amman would be released during the CSK vs RCB match on October 25.

Not just Kajal, but Tamannaah is also making her digital debut. Her series is called November Story, a crime thriller which explores the bond between a father and daughter.

Directed by Indira Parthasarathy, the series also stars Pasupathy and GM Kumar. The actor said, “There is always a time limit when you working in films and you, as an actor, are constantly rushing. But that is not the case here. I really liked his [Parthasarathy] writing.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ifnkho/article32929909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mookuthi,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mookuthi-amman-to-release-on-disney-hotstar/article32929910.ece
159,2020/10/23,‘On The Rocks’ movie review: A whimsical ride around New York,"Sofia Coppola’s new feature on Apple TV+, which marks a reunion with Bill Murray, is funny, poignant and her lightest work till date

A re-watch of Sofia Coppola’s most seminal work, Lost in Translation, even today, leaves you just as beguiled, so completely taken in by the story, mood and aesthetic woven around two lost people finding each other in surreal Tokyo; a movie that defined a relationship in a way that audiences weren’t used to before, and still finds few equal comparisons in its stead.

Which is why when On The Rocks was announced initially, with Bill Murray and Rashida Jones, it was natural to wonder if this would be Coppola’s kinda-sorta spiritual sequel to her 2003 classic; just replace Tokyo’s Grand Hyatt with the fancy boroughs of Upper East Side New York.

Also Read: Get 'First Day First Show', our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here

However, it later emerged that the Apple TV+ release would be a comedy revolving around a father and a daughter on almost a caper of sorts, learning about what love and loyalty meant in the process. Still, comparisons are inevitable, especially when it marks a reunion after five years for a much-cherished director-actor duo (Coppola and Murray collaborated last for A Very Murray Christmas in 2015).

Here, Murray plays Felix, a wealthy retired gallerist, who's wrecked a lot of (hidden) trauma in his daughter Laura’s (Jones life over the years due to his philandering ways, yet, stumbles upon an opportunity to perhaps make up for all that. How? By helping her find out if her seemingly-too good to be true husband (Marlon Wayans) is cheating on her.

On The Rocks Director: Sofia Coppola

Starring: Bill Murray, Rashida Jones, Marlon Wayans, Jenny Slate

Duration: 96 minutes

Storyline: A struggling writer suspects her husband of infidelity, and tails him across New York along with her ostentatious father to confirm her theories

Felix has spent his entire life championing a hedonistic lifestyle, wooing and flirting with every woman he’s come across, from the waitress at the cocktail party to his grand-kids' ballet teacher. His relationship with Laura has been severely fractured, yet, she — a writer struggling to finish her first book while parenting two kids, as her successful, workaholic husband constantly makes out-of-town trips — somehow, turns to him for advice on matters of fidelity.

“You’re mine until you get married,” echoes Bill Murray’s voice in the background, towards the beginning of the movie. “Then you’re still mine,” he adds. And now, years later, after he’s forgotten how it is to be loved by a daughter, he gets a second chance at fixing things; it doesn’t matter if it comes at the expense of her entire life crashing down.

In Sofia Coppola’s new feature, Rashida Jones finally gets the role she’s been waiting for her entire career

And from there, this light-hearted adventure begins in which the dad-daughter duo pursue Dean around several gorgeous New York locales (indeed, the movie is a love letter to the city) hoping to catch him red-handed, while Laura tries to quieten the growing sense of dread inside her: if her suspicions are indeed proven true, what happens next?

Conversations on everything from the differences between men and women to the innate ramifications of marriage, pepper this ride that makes you think of the director’s own life, upon which her father, Francis Ford Coppola, constantly casts his own legendary shadow.

Rashida Jones finally gets the role she’s been waiting for her entire career — fans of The Office will only remember Karen Filippelli with the most nostalgic of memories — and absolutely nails it, hook, line and sinker. Murray, who always seems to play different versions of the same character (or himself) in his films, is typically brilliant; his dry humour, world-weary face and deadpan smooth talk providing the perfect foil to Jones’ Laura, whose anxious demeanour is fed by the pressures of motherhood, insecurities over her own talent, and an entire lifetime of being a philanderer’s daughter.

Along the way, there’s also a supremely funny cameo from Jenny Slate as a school-parent friend, as upmarket NYC is tantalizingly showcased by cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd, with the likes of Chet Baker and French outfit’s Phoenix playing in the background lustfully.

On The Rocks is whimsical, wistful and wanting all at once — it may not have the swooning melancholic highs of Lost in Translation — but is still an often-funny, occasionally-poignant story of two people on their journey towards redemption, both individually and together, hand-held by a filmmaker whose last name doesn’t define her anymore.

Long before the lay of the land was known, the organisers had bravely decided to pivot to a hybrid online/physical model. Screenings were held across UK partner venues, not just London, with the majority being online. When the festival began, the country found itself in the grip of a second wave of coronavirus, but the sheer enthusiasm of a film-starved public and the joie de vivre of the organisers pulled it through and made it a success.

In a programme packed with terrific films, three stood out for me. Enough has been written about the excellent The Disciple, so moving on swiftly from there to the other film that is in the process of conquering the festival circuit, débutant Rezwan Shahriar Sumit’s Bangladesh/France production, The Salt in Our Waters (Nonajoler Kabbo). It had its world première in London and has its Asian première at the ongoing Busan Film Festival. I’ve been following the project since it was a glimmer in Sumit’s eye at the NFDC Film Bazaar in Goa a few years ago. Since then, he received a few grants, and a Spike Lee Fellowship no less. But, proof of the pudding, right?

The movie is a tremendous début, so much so that it is difficult to believe that it is a début film, so assured is the filmmaking. It is a spiritual successor to Bangladeshi doyen Mostofa Sarwar Farooki’s ground-breaking Television (2012), where new ideas arrive at an island in Bangladesh, thus disrupting the old order. However, Sumit also packs in ideas of climate change and different interpretations of theology, including a fascinating sideline in idolatry, not just physical, but philosophical as well. The film is also of a piece with two seminal man vs. nature works, Ritwik Ghatak’s A River Called Titas ( the 1973 Titas Ekti Nodir Naam) and Ramu Kariat’s Chemmeen (1965). Sumit is a talent to be watched and nurtured.

Also disrupting the old order is Mexican filmmaker Michel Franco’s New Order (Nuevo Orden). The film came to London after winning awards at Venice and much festival play elsewhere. Franco has always liked to challenge audiences, beginning with his first feature Daniel and Ana (2009), where kidnapped siblings are forced to have sex on camera. In New Order, he challenges us so much that the result is so believable that it is terrifying. The film is about a revolution in Mexico where the majority (all people of colour) brutally rise against the one-percenters i.e. the wealthy and powerful (all white). Franco does not take sides and that is the scary part — the takeaway is that there is evil everywhere and in everyone. What an apt film for this annus horribilis.

To end on a cheerier note, Tomas Vinterberg’s classically shot Another Round (Druk), a far cry from his Dogme 95 days, follows four high school teachers, led by the redoubtable Mads Mikkelsen, who decide to improve matters by keeping a constant level of alcohol in their blood. Does it go pear shaped? I’m not telling. Another Round won best film at the London Film Festival.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/u4ebw2/article32928148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/New-Order-2020-04,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/films-that-conquered-at-the-bfi-london-film-festival/article32928150.ece
161,2020/10/23,Scarlett Johansson to headline Sebastian Lelio’s ‘Bride’,"The actor is currently awaiting the release of her Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie ‘Black Widow’

Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson will topline Apple and A24’s upcoming sci-fi drama “Bride.”

Sebastian Lelio, the director of Oscar-winning movie “A Fantastic Woman”, will helm the movie, being touted as a “genre-bending feature”, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The story is about a woman created to be an ideal wife: the singular obsession of a brilliant entrepreneur.

“When she rejects her creator, she’s forced to flee her confined existence, confronting a world that sees her as a monster. It is on the run that she finds her true identity, her surprising power, and the strength to remake herself as her own creation,” the official logline read.

Lelio will pen the film’s screenplay along with Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo.

Johansson, 35, will produce the feature alongside Jonathan Lia through their banner These Pictures. Keenan Flynn will serve as a co-producer.

Johansson is currently awaiting the release of her Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie “Black Widow”. The movie, which was originally scheduled to open worldwide earlier this year, will now release in May 2021.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/o1v3ti/article32927203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AWARDS-OSCARS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/scarlett-johansson-to-headline-sebastian-lelios-bride/article32927204.ece
162,2020/10/23,"‘A Suitable Boy’ review: A lavish, if predictable offering from Mira Nair","There is no dearth of stereotypes in this adaptation of Vikram Seth’s 1993 novel, yet the show moves too briskly and looks too lovely to ignore

Both Lovecraft Country and A Suitable Boy are set in the ‘50s, in different yet similar spaces. All the accusations of inadvertent stereotyping in Lovecraft Country right down to the magical negro trope makes sense.

There is no dearth of stereotypes in Mira Nair’s adaptation of Vikram Seth’s 1993 doorstopper. From a stampede and communal riots to the courtesan with a heart of gold, the passionate lover to the rough-and-ready son of the soil who probably will get the girl in the end, the slimy politician to the feckless youth and the long-suffering mother, they all wander about the beautifully-appointed frames of the BBC show.

Lata Mehra (Tanya Maniktala) is a 19-year-old literature student. It is 1951 in Brahmpur by the Ganges. At Lata’s sister, Savita’s (Rasika Dugal) wedding to Pran Kapoor (Gagan Dev Riar), her mother, Rupa (Mahira Kakkar), says she will look for a suitable boy for Lata as well. Seth’s 1349-page book, along with exploring suitable boys for Lata, also looked at the growing pains of a newly independent country.

A Suitable Boy Season: 1

Episodes: 6

Run time: 60 minutes

Director: Mira Nair

Starring: Tabu, Ishaan Khatter, Tanya Maniktala, Rasika Dugal, Ram Kapoor, Mahira Kakkar, Gagan Dev Riar, Vivek Gomber, Vivaan Shah, Shahana Goswami, Mikhail Sen, Namit Das, Danesh Razvi, Randeep Hooda, Ranvir Shorey, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Vinay Pathak

Storyline: The public and the personal intertwine in this story of a newly independent country and its people

The script by Andrew Davies was for eight episodes. Nair whittled it down to six episodes and the narrative has not suffered for it. In an interview with this writer, Nair said she shifted the focus from merely being about who Lata would marry to also talking about the politics of the time. And so Mahesh Kapoor (Ram Kapoor), the Revenue Minister is trying to get the Zamindar Act passed, there is also the first election and with the trauma of Partition fresh in everyone's minds, there is tension between Hindus and Muslims.

There is the courtesan, Saeeda Bai (Tabu), who Maan (Ishaan Khatter), Mahesh’s younger son is infatuated with. Like the book, A Suitable Boy is essential a story of four families — the Kapoors, the Mehras, the Nawab of Baitar and the sophisticated Chatterjees — Meenakshi (Shahana Goswami) is married to Lata’s stuffy older brother, Arun (Vivek Gomber), and Meenakshi’s brother, Amit (Mikhail Sen) is courting Lata).

Apart from Amit, Kabir Durrani (Danesh Razvi), who studies in Lata’s college, and Haresh Khanna (Namit Das) a self-made shoe salesman, are also in love with Lata.

The show moves briskly and looks lovely. The actors are uniformly good from statuesque Tabu to quick-silver Ishaan and dewdrop Tanya. Vinay Pathak as the horrid Home Ninister, Ranvir Shorey as Waris who stands against Mahesh in the election, Randeep Hooda as the suave Billy Irani and Vivaan Shah as Lata’s youngest brother Varun are absolutely first-class.

Yes, A Suitable Boy is predictable and there is the discomfort on seeing these lives of privilege where Schubert and Shakespeare trip lightly off the tongue. It is however, a beautifully-shot and produced show with the period details brought to life in thrilling, lived-in detail. It would be downright curmudgeonly to turn away from such a tasty morsel in these days of starvation for happy tidings.

A Suitable Boy is currently streaming on Netflix",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/zg9vdp/article32927017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/final2075113320751123,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/a-suitable-boy-review-a-lavish-if-predictable-offering-from-mira-nair/article32927018.ece

164,2020/10/23,Mira Nair’s ‘Monsoon Wedding’ musical to open in India next year,"The 63-year-old director said the musical beautifully captures the spirit of the film.

Celebrated filmmaker Mira Nair’s stage musical adaptation of her 2001 movie Monsoon Wedding will premiere in India in November, 2021. During a virtual masterclass at Busan Film Festival, Nair said the musical will first open in India and then in Singapore, Dubai and London.

“We are going to open next year, November 2021. First in India, and then in Singapore, and Dubai, perhaps, and then bring it to London and the United States. It’s a wonderful musical with music from Vishal Bhardwaj, one of our great composers, 21 new songs,” said Nair.

According to Variety, the musical based on the 2001 Venice Golden Lion winning film was scheduled to open earlier this year in the UK at the Leeds Playhouse and London’s Roundhouse, but the premiere got delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The 63-year-old director said the musical beautifully captures the spirit of the film.

“It is very, very close to the film in spirit, but it’s a stage musical. And that’s the something that I have been working on very painstakingly for 10-11 years. So now we are ready. And we’re looking for COVID to leave us so that we can open on the big stages,” Nair added.

Monsoon Wedding centred around a dysfunctional Indian family as they prepare for their daughter’s wedding. The film featured Naseeruddin Shah, Lillete Dubey, Shefali Shah, and Vasundhara Das.

The film had its world premiere as a stage musical at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2017.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/qtylz5/article32926200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/monsoon,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mira-nairs-monsoon-wedding-musical-to-open-in-india-next-year/article32926201.ece
165,2020/10/23,Suriya’s ‘Soorarai Pottru’ release postponed,"The actor said that a few NOCs are still pending for the approval which has led to the delay in the release

The release of Suriya’s much-anticipated Tamil language action drama film Soorarai Pottru has been delayed indefinitely.

This film is a fictionalised version of the book Simply Fly written on the life of Air Deccan founder Captain G. R. Gopinath.

The movie, directed by Sudha Kongara, was originally scheduled to premiere on Amazon Prime Video on October 30, but in a Twitter post on Thursday the actor shared the film has been pushed and a new release date will be announced soon.

Suriya, 45, shared the news via signed letter posted on his official page on the microblogging site.

“When we started ‘Soorarai Pottru’ we thought the only challenges we would face will be shooting at never-before-shot-locations, working with people of different languages and brining in personnel with different skill sets to bring the magnificent world of Maara. Though easily said, it was a mammoth task to execute,” the actor said.

He said considering the story is set in the aviation industry, it is necessary for the makers to obtain No Objection Certificate (NOC) from various agencies and the process will take its due course.

Suriya said a few NOCs are still pending for the approval which has led to the delay in the release.

“We had to deal with numerous procedures and permissions, because it’s a matter of national security and we are dealing with real Indian Air Force aircrafts and security. A few new NOCs are still pending for approval and we understand the wait is inevitable as this adverse time is demanding more and more focus on the nation and its priorities, than anything else.”

He added: “Unfortunately, the wait for the film’s release will now be a little longer than anticipated.”

Along with the letter, Suriya also released a new song Aagasam from the film, which he said is dedicated to friendship, love and affection.

Soorarai Pottru also features actors Aparna Balamurali, Paresh Rawal and Mohan Babu in pivotal roles.

The film is produced by Suriya’s 2D Entertainment and co-produced by Guneet Monga’s Sikhya Entertainment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ergaxa/article32926176.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sp,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/suriyas-soorarai-pottru-release-postponed/article32926177.ece

167,2020/10/23,Plea of architecture course aspirant dismissed,"He wanted NTA to display answer key for drawing exam

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has dismissed the plea of an architecture course aspirant who sought a direction to the National Testing Agency (NTA) to display the provisional answer key for Drawing Part III paper of B. Arch admission conducted for JEE (Main) examination, April 2020.

The petitioner, T. Kavinraj, said Drawing Part III paper examination was conducted in ‘pen and paper’ offline mode to be attempted on a drawing sheet to test the drawing aptitude of candidates, for which there was no answer key. He sought display of the answer key so that if candidates were not satisfied with it, they could challenge it.

The NTA submitted that for the subjective paper no answer key was provided and there could not be allotment of partial marks for every stage of drawing. The answer sheets were assessed by two independent subject experts and if their assessment differed by more than 25 % it was placed for scrutiny before a head expert.

If the difference between the marks given by the two experts was less than 25%, then the average was taken. The process of dual verification was followed in order to curb the possibility of incorrect assessment and prepare the result in a fair and transparent manner. The petitioner was aware of this system of conduct of the examination, it was submitted.

Justice S. Vaidyanathan observed that the common test was conducted throughout India and for Drawing Part III, which was a subjective paper, there was no need to award marks in stages and to upload the key answers in the website. Except wishing the candidate ‘All the Best’ to come out with flying colours in the forthcoming examinations, the court said, it could not grant relief to him.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/plea-of-architecture-course-aspirant-dismissed-madurai-high-court/article32931332.ece
168,2020/10/23,"TN government to persist with Governor on 7.5% quota Bill, says Jayakumar","Jayakumar said counselling for MBBS/BDS will be held only when the Bill is given assent by the Governor.

The Tamil Nadu government will be persistent with the Governor on getting assent for the Bill providing 7.5% horizontal quota NEET-qualified State government school students in medical admissions, Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar said on Friday. He added that the government and has the confidence that Governor Banwarilal Purohit will give his assent for the Bill.

Speaking to reporters in Chennai, Mr. Jayakumar said counselling for MBBS/BDS will be held only when the Bill is given assent by the Governor. “We have 100% confidence in the Governor. He will definitely give his approval to the Bill. Only when the horizontal quota of 7.5% is fulfilled will counselling be held. We are clear on that,” he said.

Mr. Jayakumar said there was nothing wrong with the Governor replying to DMK president M.K. Stalin on the issue. “The Governor told us how long it will take [to decide]. That is what he has told Mr. Stalin, who is the Leader of the Opposition which is a responsible post. The Governor has told him what the status is,” he said.

The minister also questioned as to why the DMK did not bring in a similar quota when it was in power and charged that the opposition was trying to gain credit by protesting on the issue.

To a question on PMK’s demand for 20% Vanniyar quota, the minister said the PMK had given a representation and it was for the government to reply on the matter.

When asked about the release of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s aide V K Sasikala from prison, Mr. Jayakumar said no political motives should be attributed to it. “If she comes out, it is her family that is going to be happy.

169,2020/10/23,Northeast monsoon to set in over Tamil Nadu around October 28: IMD,"Meanwhile, the Meteorological department forecast light to moderate thundershowers to continue in a few places of north Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and one or two places in south Tamil Nadu for the next two days.

Northeast monsoon is likely to set in over Tamil Nadu and Puducherry around October 28. India Meteorological Department has announced that northeasterly winds that act as a precursor to the monsoon may come in around October 26 or 27 and set the platform for northeast monsoon.

With the setting in of northeasterly winds in the lower tropospheric levels over Bay of Bengal, the southwest monsoon is expected to withdraw from the country around October 28. This would pave the way for simultaneous onset of the northeast monsoon over the southern region, officials said.

During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Friday, Pallipattu in Tiruvallur district received 17 cm of rainfall, the highest amount for the day. Several other weather stations in Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts recorded heavy rainfall. Many areas in and around the city such as Nungambakkam (7cm), Sholinganallur and Red Hills (6cm), Korattur, Alandur, Meenambakkam and Perambur (5 cm) and Chembarambakkam, Ambattur and Poonamallee (4 cm) received moderate to heavy rainfall.

More inflow into Poondi reservoir likely

Flood warning has been issued to surrounding villages of Kosasthalaiyar river in Tiruvallur district as about 900 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of water was released from Ammapalli reservoir, Krishnapuram village, upstream in Andhra Pradesh around 2 p.m. on Friday.

Officials of the Water Resources Department said the surplus water discharged on Thursday had reached Arunkulam checkdam located 15 km upstream of Poondi reservoir, which is a major reservoir that feeds city water supply.

“We expect the water released into the Kosasthalaiyar river on Friday to reach Poondi. It already got an inflow of 250 cusecs from catchment areas following rains apart from Krishna water. It has a storage of 1,310 million cubic feet against capacity of 3,231 mcft,” said an official.

Meanwhile, the Meteorological department forecast light to moderate thundershowers to continue in a few places of north Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and one or two places in south Tamil Nadu for the next two days.

S.Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai said the east-west shear zone and the depression over westcentral Bay of Bengal brought thunderstorms over the State.

The transition period of wind patterns from southwesterly to northeasterly was another reason for localised convection and intense thunderstorms. He recalled IMD’s forecast where NE monsoon is expected to bring near normal over north TN and rainfall would be below normal in southern parts.

Chennai may experience light rains in some areas during the weekend and the maximum temperature will be around 33 degree Celsius, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tre6mf/article32920363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16OCTTHWEEKENDGPG7SALPA3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/northeast-monsoon-to-set-in-over-tamil-nadu-around-october-28-imd/article32929306.ece
170,2020/10/23,Pernambut new bus stand premises inaugurated,"A modern bus terminus with required facilities would be constructed at the premises in the coming months.

Commercial Taxes Minister K.C. Veeramani on Friday inaugurated the new Pernambut bus stand premises with temporary facilities. Officials said while buses will begin to ply immediately, a modern bus terminus with required facilities would be constructed at the premises in the coming months.

The Pernambut bus terminus is a busy one from where buses leave to Chennai, Tiruvannamalai, Salem, Kancheepuram and other districts through Vellore. Once inter-state services start, services will be available even to Bengaluru. However as on date, only four buses can be accommodated in the bus stand.

“The land on which the present bus stand is located belongs to the police department. They want it back and we also thought it would be better to have the bus stand in municipality land,” said C. Vijayakumar, Regional Director, Municipal Administration.

The new bus stand will come up on one acre land and will have 10 bays. “We inaugurated the premises on Friday. We have sent a Detailed Project Report (DPR) to the government. Once it is sanctioned, we will begin the development work,” he added. An official from the Pernambut Municipal Corporation said that the bus stand will be constructed at a cost of around ₹4.15 crore under Public Private Partnership mode.

“The bus stand will have a passenger waiting area, charging stations, drinking water facility, toilets, two wheeler parking, shops and other facilities. The residents in Pernambut and surrounding villages will benefit from this new bus stand,” added the official.

Residents protest

Meanwhile some residents of the locality protested against shifting of the bus stand. “The present bus stand is located in the heart of town, but the new one is coming up three kilometers away from the town. People will find it hard to travel to the villages once they alight from the buses,” said G. Suresh Kumar, a member of the 'Pernambut bus stand redemption team'.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/h4opog/article32929251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pernambut1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pernambut-new-bus-stand-premises-inaugurated/article32929252.ece

All steps were taken for obtaining assent for the legislation seeking to provide 7.5% reservation in medical colleges for students from government schools, and parents and students can expect some “good news” soon, said Tamil Nadu School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan in Erode on Friday.

Addressing the media, the Minister said that the State government had passed the Bill seeking to provide horizontal reservation to the government and government-aided school students in the undergraduate medical admissions. “The Bill was sent to Governor Banwarilal Purohit for his approval, and parents and students can expect good news soon”, he added.

Asked about the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE) extending the validity of the Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) certificates for lifetime, Mr. Sengottaiyan said that various teachers associations had requested Chief Minister Edappadi K.

173,2020/10/23,All in State will get COVID-19 vaccine free: Palaniswami,"Virus spread on the decline, he says

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Thursday that the COVID-19 vaccine would be administered to all people in Tamil Nadu at government expense.

“People are apprehensive of contracting the novel coronavirus. When a vaccine is available, it will be administered to all free of cost,” he told reporters here after chairing a meeting to review the measures taken to control COVID-19 in the district.

Mr. Palaniswami, however, said the spread of the novel coronavirus was on the decline in the State, owing to intense measures taken by the government. Compared to the neighbouring Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the spread of the infection had been brought down in Tamil Nadu.

“The coordinated efforts have yielded good results at a time when even developed countries are finding it difficult to control the spread of the virus,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

The number of positive cases had come down, while the number of those who recovered from the infection had increased. These measures had also helped to bring down the mortality rate, he said.

Complimenting officials on their dedication in the fight against the infection, at the frontline, Mr. Palaniswami said adequate testing centres had been created all over the State and bed facilities had been augmented at hospitals. Tamil Nadu was on top in respect of testing: RT-PCR tests were being done on 90,000 persons a day.

Mr. Palaniswami accused Leader of the Opposition and DMK president M.K. Stalin of spreading false information in a “planned manner” about the investments made in the State after the global investors’ meet.

The establishment of the manufacturing unit of ITC Ltd., at Viralimalai in the backward Pudukottai district, providing employment to 2,200 persons, was an example of the government’s commitment to attracting investments and promoting industrialisation, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/b8l8sy/article32925088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jallikattu2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/all-in-state-will-get-covid-19-vaccine-free-palaniswami/article32923609.ece
174,2020/10/23,Two suspects held in theft of lingams,"Sivasankaran and Rajesh Kannan tried to sell them as precious antique items

The Idol Wing-CID on Thursday arrested two persons, who are suspected to have stolen lingams from a mutt in Varanasi and tried to sell them for crores of rupees.

The arrested were identified as S. Sivasankaran, 35, of Othakadai, and B. Rajesh Kannan, 38, of Thiruvathavur in Madurai. They tried to sell the lingams as precious antique items.

They were arrested after the investigation was reopened into the seizure of an emerald lingam from four persons who had met with an accident at Viralimalai in Pudukkottai district three years ago.

In October 2017, the police recovered an emerald lingam from a sport utility vehicle (SUV) that collided with a bus at Viralimalai. Four persons travelling in the SUV were injured. People surrounded the vehicle and retrieved the lingam, weighing 8 kg, hidden in a bag.

Investigation revealed that the four had gone to Nagercoil to sell it to a buyer. After they failed, they were returning to Chennai with the lingam.

The chargesheet was filed in a trial court and the investigation was reopened by the Idol Wing in Tiruchi on instructions from senior officers of the special wing after an application was filed in the jurisdictional court.

A special team investigated the case and arrested Sivasankaran and Rajesh Kannan. “Sivasankaran was staying in a mutt in Varanasi and had stolen three lingams from a swami. He ran a temple at a place near Othakadai and cheated devotees. He attempted to sell the two other lingams for crores of rupees,” an officer said.

The police recovered one white marble lingam, weighing 16.450 kg, hidden in an ashram at Renigunta, Andhra Pradesh. The two suspects with the seized articles were produced at the additional chief judicial magistrate court at Kumbakonam.

Police officers are not sure about the value of the lingams. “We have informed specialists and sought their help to examine them and assess their value,” the officer said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/two-suspects-held-in-theft-of-lingams/article32923575.ece

With some residents creating a flutter, claiming to have unearthed dinosaur egg fossils in an irrigation tank in Kunnam in the district, Collector V. Santha on Thursday said that she would seek expert opinion on the same from the Geological Survey of India.

Several images of large spherical objects, which some people claimed were dinosaur eggs, were shared on social media on Thursday. At least 25 such egg-shaped balls were found on the bed of the Kunnam tank.

The locals alerted revenue officials, who inspected the spot. “There are at least 25 such balls, each weighing at least 200 kg. We were unable to relocate them immediately,” said A. Chinnadurai, Kunnam Tahsildar. The matter has been reported to the District Collector.

The Collector told The Hindu that officials of the Geological Survey of India would be apprised of the finds. “We can move them to an appropriate location for safekeeping, if necessary,” she said.

177,2020/10/23,Ramadoss hits out at govt. for not fulfilling people’s demands,"PMK founder praises Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister for undertaking welfare measures

In a sharp attack on the State government on Thursday, S. Ramadoss, founder of PMK, a key ally of the ruling AIADMK, accused it of not heeding people’s demands.

On the other hand, he praised Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, saying the latter was fulfilling all his promises and was also going beyond them, delivering welfare measures to the people.

While commending Mr. Reddy in a tweet, the PMK leader, who aligned with the AIADMK ahead of last year’s Lok Sabha polls, criticised the Tamil Nadu government. He said that those ruling the State now were refusing to say anything about fulfilling the requests of the people, and even if this was pointed out to them, they were not bothered by it and were not fulfilling their needs.

However, he did not specify which demands of the people were not being fulfilled.

Call for protest

Earlier in the day, Dr. Ramadoss urged the Vanniyar community to get ready for a massive protest, demanding separate reservation.

In a social media post, he pointed out that the demand for 20% reservation for the community was a long-pending demand, for over 40 years, and a lot of protests and sacrifices had already been made for the same.

However, Dr. Ramadoss said those who ruled the State in the past, and the current government, had not fulfilled the demand.

“Time has come again to fight for our rights and this protest will be a historic one. It will make the government request us to stop the protest and accede to our demand,” he said.

‘Posturing by PMK’

The ruling AIADMK, however, felt that Dr. Ramadoss was resorting to posturing, ahead of the 2021 Assembly election, by attacking the State government.

A senior AIADMK Minister, preferring anonymity, said the PMK founder’s posturing was to improve the bargaining power of his party during the run-up to the election.

However, PMK sources said Dr. Ramadoss was upset because the government had not implemented separate reservation for the Vanniyar community.

Asked if his tweet would not cause a strain in the relationship between the PMK and the AIADMK, sources said Dr. Ramadoss was ready for the consequences, as his objective was only to obtain a separate reservation for the community.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2k59y8/article32923505.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THRAMADOSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ramadoss-hits-out-at-govt-for-not-fulfilling-peoples-demands/article32923506.ece

179,2020/10/23,Withdraw 10% EWS quota: Anbumani,"‘It is making way for social injustice’

PMK MP and youth-wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss on Thursday urged the Centre to immediately withdraw the 10% quota for economically weaker sections (EWS), among the open-competition category, contending that it was making way for social injustice.

In a statement, he said that in the recently released SBI clerk preliminary exam results, the cut-off for the OBC/SC/ST category was 59.5%, while for the EWS, it was only 57.75%. Mr. Anbumani said that when he raised the issue last year, the Centre had unofficially said that the cut-off would be raised from this year. If the argument is that this year too, only a lesser number of EWS candidates appeared for the exams, then it should be interpreted that they have been given a higher quota, he said.

Opportunities meant for SC/ST and OBC candidates were going to EWS candidates, and this was dangerous and against the principle of social justice, Mr. Anbumani said.

In a separate statement, PMK founder S. Ramadoss urged the State government to follow the example of the Andhra Pradesh government, which has set up a separate welfare board for 56 major castes under the backward classes category.

He pointed out that 263 castes were classified under the backward classes category, and a separate welfare board should be formed for those with a population higher than 30,000, and a person from that category should be appointed as head of the welfare board.

In a separate statement, Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani, pointing out the social injustice in the SBI clerk preliminary exam results, said the EWS quota was brought in for the welfare of the upper castes. He also said that parties like Congress and CPI(M), which voiced support for the EWS quota, should reconsider it. He also said that NEET too was benefitting only the upper castes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/withdraw-10-ews-quota-anbumani/article32923298.ece
180,2020/10/23,‘Land acquisition for project to be expedited’,"CM reiterates government’s commitment to implementing river-link project

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday reiterated his government’s commitment towards implementing the Cauvery-Gundar river-link project, and said that it would fulfill the dreams of the farming community.

Unveiling a statue of ‘a jallikattu bull with tamer’ in the Viralimalai Assembly constituency, represented by Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, Mr. Palaniswami said steps would be taken to acquire the required land expeditiously for the canal to be dug up from Mayanur, Karur district.

The scheme envisages a new link canal for 250 km to carry surplus waters of the Cauvery from the Mayanur barrage in Karur district to Agniyaru, South Vellar, Manimutharu, the Vaigai and Gundar under the intra-State river-linking programme. The mega project will fulfill the dreams of the people of agrarian Pudukottai and turn the district into a fertile region, he said, adding that he would soon visit the district to lay the foundation for the project.

Terming Pudukottai “a land of valour”, Mr. Palaniswami said that as many as 110 jallikattu events, the highest in the State, were organised in the district last year. He complimented Mr. Vijayabaskar, jallikattu organisers and officials for installing the statue at Viralimalai.

Earlier, speaking after inspecting a manufacturing unit of the ITC in Viralimalai taluk, Mr. Palaniswami said that Tamil Nadu stood first, at the all-India level, in attracting new investments in 2020. The State was able to attract investments to the tune of ₹40,718 crore, notwithstanding the pandemic, by signing 55 MoUs that would provide employment opportunities to 74,712 persons, he said.

Tamil Nadu was at the forefront of industrialisation, and it had successfully organised two global investors’ meets and had attracted substantial investments, the Chief Minister said.

During the 2015 global investors’ meet, the ITC signed an MoU with the State to invest over ₹1,077 crore for setting up its plant for manufacturing food products at Viralimalai. In the first phase, the company invested ₹820 crore, providing employment to 2,200 persons.

Nearly 85% of the employment at the ITC unit was provided to rural women residing in the surrounding areas.

The ITC invested another ₹351 crore, in the second phase, for its expansion and the creation of other facilities. He complimented the ITC for setting up its plant here and for executing community development projects in the area. He invited the company to make more investments in the State.

Mr. Palaniswami also inaugurated Ashirwad’s wheat flour making unit, set up at a cost of ₹100 crore, at the plant. Ministers C. Vijayabaskar, M.C. Sampath and S. Kamaraj, Pudukottai Collector P.

In a bid to boost fitness within the force, the Fire and Rescue Services Department has opened a gym in Villupuram to help firefighters attached to 14 fire stations in Villupuram and Kallakurichi districts remain physically fit for the task.

The gym was set up by Robin Castro, District Fire Officer of Villupuram district. A 2019-batch officer, Mr. Castro has introduced a schedule for all the 145 firefighters in Villupuram and Kallakurichi districts to remain physically and mentally fit.

Inspired by the Director General of Police (DGP) of the Fire and Rescue Services Department, C. Sylendra Babu, a fitness enthusiast, Mr. Castro has roped in enthusiastic firefighters, including commandoes attached to the force, to make time for an hour of practice daily before resuming work.

On an average, firemen in the two districts attend to 130 distress calls besides executing rescue operations.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the personnel are also engaged in the decontamination of public places under the civic bodies.

“Such a fitness programme was necessary to not only keep the force fit but also reduce their stress levels. This has helped them improve their performance,” he said.

As part of their training, the commandos have to run for 5 km daily, followed by weight training for 20 minutes, rope training and tyre exercises.

The team, led by Mr. Castro, also goes cycling during the weekends, covering a minimum of 100 km.

P. Sivagurunathan, leading fireman attached to the Villupuram Fire Station, said that the physical training has been an integral part of his daily routine.

“I make it a point to exercise at the gym here daily for one-and-a-half hours. This has not only helped me build muscles but also improve my overall well-being and productivity,” he said.

Mr. Castro said that the facilities for weight training have been introduced for firemen in all the 14 stations in the two districts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a3th4a/article32923598.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THLTGYM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fitness-programme-launched-at-fire-stations/article32923599.ece

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder and MP Thol. Thirumavalavan has written to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking the withdrawal of Tamil Nadu Governor Bunwarilal Purohit.

The letter cited the Governor’s inordinate delay in giving assent to the legislation brought in by the State government for providing horizontal reservation of 7.5% to government school students in medical courses, which has been unanimously passed in the Assembly.

“A Governor is appointed by your Excellency in accordance with Article 155 of the Constitution of India. Article 163 of the Constitution of India clearly says that ‘there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions,” he noted in the letter dated October 21.

Mr. Thirumavalavan pointed out that the Governor of Tamil Nadu was violating this obligations, and this created hindrance to the State government. He also noted that the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) results were already published and students were anxiously waiting to join medical courses. The State government has made all the arrangements for conducting the counselling for the admission process, he added.

Mr. Thirumavalavan said that the indifferent attitude of the Governor had jeopardised the entire medical admission process. “The Governor is not only creating an obstacle but also a constitutional crisis.

The release of actor Suriya’s Soorarai Pottru on Amazon Prime Video, slated for October 30, has been put off.

188,2020/10/23,"Need 3 to 4 weeks to decide on 7.5% quota Bill, says Governor","DMK leader Stalin calls for demonstration before Raj Bhavan tomorrow

Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Thursday said it would take at least three to four weeks for him to arrive at a decision on granting assent to the Bill seeking to provide 7.5% horizontal reservation to NEET-qualified State government school students in undergraduate medical admissions.

Replying to DMK president M.K. Stalin, who had on Wednesday written to the Governor urging him to give his nod to the Bill, Mr. Purohit said he was already seized of the matter and was getting it examined from all angles. The Bill seeks to give horizontal reservation for those who have studied in government schools from Classes 6 to 12 and have qualified in NEET for medical admissions.

“The same has also been informed to the delegation of Ministers who had called on me recently,” the Governor said in his letter, which was circulated to the media.

The Governor’s reply came on a day when Mr. Stalin announced a demonstration in front of the Raj Bhavan on Saturday to urge Mr. Purohit to give his assent to the legislation immediately.

Mr. Stalin had earlier said that the Governor did not understand the urgency, and his delay in granting assent had posed a challenge to the “honour” of the Legislative Assembly.

“The delay has created a situation where government school students cannot enter medical colleges. The Governor and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami are not able to raise their voice because of the pressure from the BJP government at the Centre,” the DMK leader said.

Soon after Mr. Purohit wrote to him, Mr. Stalin accused the State government of suppressing from the people the fact that the Governor had already briefed the Ministerial delegation about the time he required to study the Bill.

“There is a rumour that the Governor had demanded the implementation of 10% reservation for economically weaker sections, among the forward communities, as a quid pro quo, to give assent to the Bill. The Ministers should explain whether such a demand was made by the Governor,” the Leader of the Opposition said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7ooog4/article32923341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THBANWARILAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/need-3-to-4-weeks-to-decide-on-75-quota-bill-says-governor/article32923342.ece

190,2020/10/23,HC refuses to entertain appeal against woman’s acquittal from bigamy case,"Judge upholds trial court’s judgment

The Madras High Court refused to entertain an appeal against the acquittal of a woman from the charge of bigamy. She had been accused of marrying for the second time a month after obtaining an ex-parte divorce decree, which got set aside four months thereafter.

Though her first husband had accused the woman of having chosen to go for a second marriage after a sub court had ordered notice to her on his plea to set aside the ex-parte divorce decree, Justice P.N. Prakash refused to grant leave to file an appeal against the acquittal.

The judge pointed out that even according to the appellant (the first husband who had lodged the complaint of bigamy), his wife had filed a divorce petition in 2011, obtained an ex-parte decree on February 19, 2015 and got married to another person on March 22, 2015.

Pointing out that the second marriage had reportedly taken place only after the dissolution of the first marriage, the judge said the contention that the ex-parte divorce decree was set aside by the same sub court in Arani on July 10, 2015, was “a different matter”.

He also went on to state that for the offence of bigamy, it was essential for the complainant to prove that the accused underwent religious matrimonial ceremonies required to complete the marriage. Such proof was miserably absent in the present case, he added.

The judge held that a judicial magistrate in Ranipet had rightly acquitted the woman, her second husband and parents from Sections 494 (marrying during lifetime of husband or wife) read with Section 109 (abetment) of the Indian Penal Code on July 17. “This court does not find any perversity or illegality in the order passed by the trial court warranting interference,” Justice Prakash observed.

In his verdict, judicial magistrate E. Deiveegan had refused to punish the accused solely on the basis of a marriage registration certificate produced by the complainant to claim that his wife had got married to another person. He had insisted upon corroborative evidence.

The magistrate said even an admission by the accused that she married another person during the lifetime of her first husband could not be valid evidence to prove such a marriage. The onus was only upon the complainant to prove the fact through sufficient evidence.

It was essential to prove through credible eye-witnesses or documentary evidence that the accused, professing Hinduism, had got married by performing rituals such as ‘Saptapadi’ and ‘Homam’ or through ‘Suyamariyadhai’ (self-respect) or ‘Sirthirutha’ (reformist) mode, he had said.

In the present case, “the prosecution had neither established that the essential ceremonies had been performed nor that the performance of essential ceremonies had been abrogated by the custom governing the communities to which the parties belonged.

“Hence, this court finds that the prosecution has failed to prove the case of the marriage between A1 and A4 beyond reasonable doubts,” the Magistrate had held.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/95nq8r/article32923126.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-refuses-to-entertain-appeal-against-womans-acquittal-from-bigamy-case/article32923127.ece
191,2020/10/23,Panel awards compensation to woman denied info under RTI Act,"Her plea seeking husband’s pay details was rejected as ‘third party’ information

The Tamil Nadu Information Commission has awarded compensation of ₹10,000 to a woman whose petition under the Right to Information Act seeking her husband’s pay particulars was rejected as “third party” information.

The case relates to the petition filed by A.V. Sukanya of Madurai, who sought pay details of her husband, a professor in Alagappa University, Karaikudi.

The information was required to support her alimony claim in court. However, the varsity’s Public Information Officer rejected her petition, stating that it was “third party” information.

Aggrieved over the response of the PIO and the First Appellate Authority, the petitioner moved the TNIC.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj heard both parties over the phone. Passing orders in the case, he held that the PIO had deliberately denied information to the petitioner. Knowing well that the details called for by the woman were required to get legal remedy for herself and her son, the public authority refused to part with the same.

Directing Alagappa University authorities to pay ₹10,000 as compensation to the woman, Mr. Muthuraj reminded the public authority the order of the Madras High Court asking the Chief Secretary to issue a circular to all Departments, Public Sector Undertakings and Corporations warning them of the legal consequences of not furnishing information under the RTI Act, 2005.

He also directed the PIO to provide the three months’ pay slips of the employee, legal heir particulars as entered in the service report and other data sought by the petitioner.

193,2020/10/23,Nilgiris farmers move HC for settling loans availed in 2006-08,"They want nationalised banks to come up with one-time settlement scheme

A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the State government to issue necessary orders requesting all nationalised banks to come up with a one-time settlement scheme for the benefit of farmers who had taken loans between 2006 and 2008 for shifting from tea to flower cultivation but ended up suffering huge losses.

The petition filed by Nilgiris District Floriculture Small Farmers’ Association was listed for admission before a vacation bench of Justices V. Parthiban and G.R. Swaminathan on Thursday. The judges directed the Registry to list it before a regular Division Bench led by Justice M. Sathyanarayanan on October 28 when the court would reopen after the Dussehra holidays.

In an affidavit, filed through advocate Srinath Sridevan, the association president N. Vishwanathan said Nilgiris tea market was once the second largest in the country. Tea was cultivated over 45,974 hectares which amounted to 70% of cultivable land in the district. Vast majority of the cultivation was done by small farmers who owned less than one acre of land each.

Around 65,000 families were dependant on tea cultivation for their livelihood. However, in 2003, there was a great recession in the global market. Hence, the government encouraged farmers to take up cultivation of exotic flowers and provided all necessary support including subsidies. Accordingly, several farmers availed huge amount of loans for the transformation.

However, they could not succeed in cultivating the flowers due to multiple reasons including the July 2008 squalls which destroyed the green houses constructed at huge costs. Since then, the farmers had been resorting to various forms of protest urging the government to come to their rescue and prevent the banks from taking coercive steps to recover the loans.

In 2015, the association filed a writ petition seeking a direction to the government to frame a debt alleviation scheme. On July 22, 2016, the then Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice R. Mahadevan directed the government to examine the plea. Accordingly, the Collector constituted a committee comprising government officials and farmers to assess the losses.

On the basis of the committee’s report, the Collector on August 17, 2018 recommended implementation of a one-time settlement scheme by which the farmers could be asked to repay only 50% of the principal amount after waiving off interest and penal interest. Though many banks implemented the recommendation without waiting for government’s nod, a couple of them had not done so, the association complained.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xeg56u/article32922804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NILGRIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nilgiris-farmers-move-hc-for-settling-loans-availed-in-2006-08/article32922805.ece
194,2020/10/23,Illegal mobile phone re-sale network busted in Chennai,"Nine suspects arrested; over 50 stolen handsets worth ₹6 lakh recovered

The police busted a criminal network which was dealing in stolen mobile phones at a subway near Beach railway station in the early hours of Thursday.

Nine suspects were nabbed by a special team led by Joint Commissioner of Police, North, V. Balakrishnan.

The special team began investigations following a tip-off on the registration number of a suspicious two-wheeler in Tondiarpet. The team shadowed the suspect and were led to a gang that gathered at the subway near Burma Bazaar.

A police officer said, “The criminals stole mobile phones from people who were walking during the night. Between 5 a.m.-7a.m., the illegal market was functioning. The brokers, who also assembled in the subway, bought handsets from the snatchers for prices ranging from ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 each. Later, they sold the hardware to shopkeepers in Burma Bazaar and other grey markets.”

IMEI number changed

“The sellers formatted the gadgets and put them in new packaging. The network then sent the packaged phones to other States, mostly Kerala and Bihar. They even changed the IMEI numbers using a software so that police would not be able to trace the gadgets,” said the officer.

The suspects have been identified as R. Marudhupandian, 49, of Tondiarpet; S. Chandru, 34, of Vyasarpadi; S. Pugazhendhi, 27, of Manali; S. Anthonysamy, 48, of Mannady; N. Balamurugan, 40, of M.K.B. Nagar; and four others.

Over 50 mobile phones worth ₹6 lakh were recovered from them. They were remanded in judicial custody.

195,2020/10/23,Empowering girls in Koovathur hamlet through kabaddi,"PT master Satish Kumar coaches them for free

G. Satish Kumar, a 32-year-old PT master at Swami Dayananda Matriculation School, has been providing kabaddi coaching for the girls in Koovathur fishing hamlet for the past three years. His aim: to secure a good future for them. Though the coaching is free, he is forced to seek donations from others to provide jerseys and shoes for the team members. Now the district police have come forward to help his team.

“Most of the families here are poor and some of them get their girl children married at an early age due to poverty. I wanted to stop this. Hence I went and spoke to the parents and convinced them that the sport can fetch their children collegiate education and a good job. Many of them agreed and started sending their children for coaching despite their hardship,” he said.

He formed a sports club and is now coaching 15 girls who are studying in Class VII.

“It takes three years to develop a good team. They have won district and divisional tournaments and took part in State-level school kabaddi events. But the team does not have proper jerseys or shoes and I struggle to take them for tournaments in other districts. Being poor, most of the children are are not able to fend even for their travel expenses,” he added.

The team is supposed to participate in a tournament in Tiruvannamalai on Friday and when Mr. Kumar was wondering how to travel to the district with his team mates, help arrived from the police. “I heard about the team and I requested a NGO called Directions Charitable Trust to sponsor them. We will try to help them in whichever way possible. Involving the girls in sports and making them excel in it will help prevent child marriages too. We will organise other skill development programmes,” said E Sundaravathanan, ASP, Mamallapuram sub-division.

Arjunan Isaiarasu from Directions Charitable Trust said his organisation was happy to help the team. “We will continue to support them,” he said.

M. Nathiya, mother ōf M. Narmada who is part of the Kabaddi team, said she wanted her daughter to excel in sports and get a good job. “Seeing her, other residents in our hamlet are inspired and send their daughters for coaching. We will not get her married at a young age, we want her to pursue higher studies.

196,2020/10/23,"TET certificate validity extension should be given to all, say teachers’ associations","They urge NCTE to consider the plight of those who have already cleared the test

Teachers’ associations have welcomed the decision by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) to grant lifetime validity to the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) certificate in future. But they have appealed for extending the benefit to teachers who have already cleared the test.

The NCTE approved the extension of the validity at its general body meeting held in September and said the provision to extend the validity from seven years to a lifetime would have “prospective effect”. “For those who have already passed out and already have the certificates, the NCTE would take legal opinion and act accordingly,” it said.

The Tamil Nadu Teacher Association has said the decision will benefit teachers. But it has called for steps to extend this provision to teachers who have already got through the test.

Livelihood issues

“Teachers are losing their livelihood owing to lack of work and the certificates expiring after seven years will cause them more worries. We urge the NCTE to consider the plight of teachers who already have the certificates and extend their validity,” said P.K. Ilamaran, president, Tamil Nadu Teacher Association.

In 2013, over 70,000 teachers passed the TNTET and several thousands are yet to land jobs.

“Keeping this in mind, we are appealing to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister to extend the validity of the certificates of all these teachers,” said M. Elangovan, coordinator, 2013 TNTET Qualified Teachers Welfare Association.

In 2018, the Tamil Nadu government announced that apart from the TNTET, teachers would have to qualify in a competitive exam. “Instead of going in for this additional exam, we want hiring to be done on the basis of TET seniority — for instance, teachers who cleared the TET back in 2013 and are still without jobs can be given preference...,” Mr. Elangovan said.

In a circular, the Tamil Nadu Teachers Education University informed its affiliated colleges of the NCTE’s decision to extend the validity of the TET certificate.

Registrar V. Balakrishnan asked the colleges to encourage students pursuing B.Ed and M.Ed to take up the TET.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tet-certificate-validity-extension-should-be-given-to-all-say-teachers-associations/article32922512.ece

The review was mandated as the State faced a major cut in the releases from the Central government following the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The State’s revenue and income had been adversely affected due to the lockdown imposed on account of COVID-19.

There was also cut in the funds from the Centre receivable by the State. The Centre’s GDP had dropped to negative (-24 per cent) and this had a major impact on the States. Given these circumstances, there was a need to prepare estimates on how much funds were actually available so that a decision could be taken on the quantum of funds that could be allotted to departments.

198,2020/10/23,"Maize procurement at ₹ 1,850 a quintal","CM unhappy with farmers for cultivating maize in kharif

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has ordered procurement of maize by Telangana State Cooperative Marketing Federation (MARKFED) at a support price of ₹ 1,850 a quintal at food grains procurement centres to be opened in villages like in the last season.

He made the announcement at a meeting with agriculture and civil supplies officials to discuss procurement of agricultural produce and regulated farming in the current season. He expressed dissatisfaction that the farmers cultivated maize in kharif despite a call by government restraining them from going for the crop as it was unlikely that they will get the support price.

The government was actually not mandated to procure maize but farmers cultivated the crop despite being told not to go for it. Yet, with the sole objective to ensure that the farmers did not suffer losses, the government had decided to procure them in spite of financial drain on its resources. He warned that the government may not procure maize if it was again grown in the coming rabi.

A release later said Mr. Rao recalled the government procuring nine lakh tonnes of maize through MARKFED at a cost of ₹ 1,668 crore in rabi last year. As the stocks did not fetch a good price in open market, it had to be auctioned off for a mere ₹ 823 crore. The MARKFED suffered a loss of ₹ 845 crore.

The procurement price of MARKFED was ₹ 1,760 a quintal but incidentals and transportation escalted the price to ₹ 2,000 a quintal. The auction price, however, was only ₹1,150 a quintal. The government was forced to dispose of the produce at lower rate as it did not have market in the country.

In this context, the government asked farmers not to cultivate maize in the just concluded kharif. It was suggested as an inter-crop over small acres of land with turmeric in Nizamabad, Nirmal, Jagtial, Mahbubabad and some other districts. However, the appeal of government and agriculture officials fell on deaf ears of some farmers, he said.

This resulted in the danger of farmers losing heavily. As a farmer friendly government, it could not remain silent to the impending danger to the community, and, therefore decided to purchase the crop.

Mr. Rao said Telangana had earned a name for itself as nowhere in the country for its welfare measures to farmers and development of agriculture. Farmers welfare topped the agenda of the State government. It developed farmers as an organised force. The government also introduced regulated farming with a view to earn remunerative price for farmers for the first time in the country with the coordination of farmers. It constructed one lakh threshing yards at the fields of farmers. Another 2,600 farmers’ meeting places were under construction. Having done so, it could not be silent to losses expected for farmers, he said.

He once again appealed to farmers not to cultivate maize in the coming rabi. He blamed the Central government for distress sale by maize farmers on account of reduction in import duty.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/maize-procurement-at-1850-a-quintal/article32931866.ece

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao questioned why corona vaccine would be distributed free only in Bihar and why it was not free in Telangana? He wondered whether the BJP government at Centre was limited to Bihar only and asked how the vaccine would be supplied in Telangana. He flayed the BJP for stooping low with such a poll promise.

He made these comments while admitting some BJP workers into Telangana Rashtra Samithi at Mirddodi on Friday. He was referring to the release of BJP’s election manifesto for Bihar by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman on Thursday.

Mr. Harish Rao urged the people to vote for Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in the Dubbak assembly bye-election stating that development was possible only with the TRS.

“BJP has been carrying on a false campaign against the TRS. BJP is a ‘Bharatiya Jhoota Party’. We have developed the State in a way which was not seen for the last seven decades. There is a transformation in villages with Vaikuntha Dhamam, dump yards and Palle Prakruthi Vanams.

“Apart from this, large numbers of CCTVs are also being set up in Telangana covering nearly 64% of total share in the country. Though some of the trainees were affected by COVID, academy director V.V.Srinivasa Rao had taken up the issue in an efficient manner and completed the training,” he said.

The Minister said the world was witnessing rapid change and problems are becoming more complex and the situations sometimes turn considerably violent. “As police officers, you have to understand the dynamics of each situation and intervene in a balanced, positive and constitutionally acceptable manner,” he said.

Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy said that trainees should exhibit utmost discipline and resolute perseverance that has been ingrained during their induction training at the academy.

He also stressed on demonstrating their professional knowledge, uniform service delivery and skill while leading the personnel under their charge, towards achieving the objectives and goals of the State. The government has provided 33 % reservation for women in the police department.

“The tasks and challenges given to police are both sensitive and complicated. You should keep themselves updated in law and usage of technology in policing. You must work for crime-free society and never relinquish the virtues of honesty, impartiality, respect for human rights, dedication to duty and sense of responsibility while discharging your duties in protecting the State from threats to its property, lives and self-respect of its citizens,” Mr. Reddy added .",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/state-to-recruit-20000-more-police-officers/article32931177.ece

202,2020/10/23,Storage bags that reduce post-harvest seed losses,"IITH researchers develop neem oil based nanofibrous bags for seed storage

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) have developed a neem oil encapsulated electrospun polyurethane nanofibrous bags for seed storage. The real time storage experiment carried out for 75 days showed that 90 % seeds stored in these bags were uninfected while 70 % seeds in commercial bags were found to be infected with storage fungi.

The research, partially funded by DST-INSPIRE faculty grant, was led by Chandra Shekhar Sharma, Associate Professor in Department of Chemical Engineering at the IIT Hyderabad. This is a first ever attempt to fabricate nanofibrous bags with the aim to reduce the post-harvest seed storage losses.

The researchers encapsulated neem oil (NO) into the polyurethane (PU) nanofibers and carried out real time testing of the PUNO bags by storing three different kinds of seeds for total 75 days at normal room temperature conditions. The stored seeds were then tested for any microbial invasion.

The research was published in the international peer-reviewed scientific journal The Journal of Applied Polymer Science. The research paper was co-authored with his PhD student Mrunalini K. Gaydhane, and Sampada P. Pudkea from Creative & Advanced Research Based on Nanomaterials (CARBON) Laboratory of the Department of Chemical Engineering.

“The fabricated PUNO-10% mat possesses excellent load capacity, and maximum tensile strain values superior than the commercial polypropylene patterned sample. The real time applicability of PUNO-10% pouches infers that any type of seeds can be stored for longer duration at normal room temperature conditions. The stored seeds in nanofibrous pouches for 75 days have successfully inhibited the growth of storage borne fungi.

204,2020/10/23,Prints from the wild: Ministry of Mumbai’s Magic digital festival,"The last couple of days of Biodiversity By The Bay feature comic Daniel Fernandes and screenwriter Anu Menon

Earlier this month, it was announced that the controversial Metro car shed at Mumbai’s Aarey colony was being shifted to Kanjurmarg, a locality in the eastern part of the bustling city. If you’re wondering why this is crucial, the eco-sensitive zone has been in the news for the past few months, ever since the government ordered the felling of over 2,700 trees to make way for the Metro Rail. Ironically, just a few days prior to the car shed making headlines once again, Ministry of Mumbai’s Magic — a collective of Mumbaikars and organisations, such as climate non-profit Waatavaran — and entertainment company DeadAnt launched a three-week digital festival aimed at celebrating the city’s biodiversity through the arts.

Founded amidst the pandemic in August this year, the collective shot to fame for their efforts to protect the city’s flamingos and their shrinking habitats. Since then, they have also highlighted Mumbai’s disappearing green cover and rapid urbanisation. Their latest initiative is Biodiversity By The Bay, which concludes on October 25.

The final week, dedicated to comedy, included live sets by East India Comedy’s Kunal Rao, The Anti Social Network’s host José Covaco, and stand-up artist Prashasti Singh, among others. Tune in today for a performance by comic Daniel Fernandes, which will be followed by a session by director-screenwriter Anu Menon on Sunday. “Menon’s sketch will explore the things women should be wary of before agreeing to date a man, and how that conveniently relates to preserving our flamingo habitats,” says Sonali Bhasin, Senior Strategist at Purpose Climate Lab (PCL), a member of the Magic coalition.

Looking back at week one

The themes explored so far have been both informative and immersive. The first week of Biodiversity By The Bay had brought together a host of artistic interventions, including artists Shilo Shiv Suleman and Pia Alize whose work raised awareness about the Aarey forest, Priyanka Paul’s piece on the Covid-hit Koli fishing community, and Vinu Joseph’s animated artwork exploring the relationship between a boy and a hermit crab.

Bhasin says the response has been phenomenal. “We’ve had over a million people engage with the festival. We have also seen an increase in the number of signatures for the petition [to Aditya Thackeray with five demands to protect Mumbai’s environment]. Everybody seems to have really embraced the fight for the flamingos.”

Beyond the fest

But how do the organisers see the collective bringing about actual change in Mumbai’s ecosystem? Addressing on-ground conservation efforts, Arpita Bhagat, Campaign Manager at PCL, says several people have been involved in these initiatives over the years. “From those working with the Koli community to activists at the frontline of the Save Aarey movement, we are excited to bring new voices into the conversation,” she says, adding, “There are many youngsters in the city who are interested in these issues, but don’t have a starting point. Festivals like these will spark new entry points into the climate conversation, and provide people with direction.”

205,2020/10/23,Pandemic woes on canvas,"Mahesh Pottabathini and Chippa Sudhakar showcase their lockdown works at a virtual show held at Gangneung Art Centre in South Korea

Artist Mahesh Pottabathini’s drawings of ‘twisted human form’ metaphorically depict human beings cooped up in their inner selves, hiding emotions, unable to express. A teacher at Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University, he thrives on drawing this form. “It’s a mental perception; One cannot see it physically but can experience the emotions through facial expressions,” he shares. This visual perception of a human mind shaped his narrative when COVID-19 struck in March.

The artist was to travel in September to Busan City in Republic of Korea, to showcase his works at Gangneung Art Centre for the ‘Recycling Story 2020 Age of Reflection’ organised by PyeongChang ARTccc but the pandemic changed all that. The virtual group show featured works of 20 artists from seven countries on the ‘COVID-19’ theme. Mahesh found a connect between his ‘twisted human form’ and a world halted due to the pandemic. “Lockdown is not about being confined indoors; it is an emotional pause affecting the human race,” he says, adding an individual is getting ‘twisted’ due to surroundings and situations.

A work by Mahesh Pottabathini | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

Among the five works that Mahesh sent, ‘Hope Light’ portrays hope for the human being amid pandemic; his ‘Where To Go’ depicts uncertain situations faced in the universe (lockdown being one). In ‘Two Portraits’ the artist plunges into a void depicting the isolation and loneliness and an uncertainty of expression; ‘Whose Tail’, a satirical work is a symbolic comparison of bad conduct towards the world.

He used the traditional Korean paper Hanji to create different layers. Explaining the process he says, “I used to trace the drawing on Hanji and apply glue on an expression I didn’t like in it. I used to create five layers of the drawing, tracing one paper over another. With this layering, I wanted to portray both the situation during pandemic and also the human tendency to hide feelings.”

Mahesh fondly recalls his trip to Busan last year with his collection of pixelated woven images (appearing like an ikat weave). “I was excited to showcase my works for the second time but life had other plans.”

Trauma of the marginalised

A work by Chippa Sudhakar | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

When most of India was confined indoors during the lockdown, artist Chippa Sudhakar wanted to highlight the trauma of the marginalised during the lockdown. He compared his own life to the lives of migrants, especially their journey to their home towns. “We had to adapt and adjust to our new lives due to pandemic. There was not much change to my working style but the migrants had to face lot of hardships to simply survive and reach their home towns,” he shares.

Sudhakar’s art works in mixed media and wood depict how the migrants had to move from one place to another like wild animals and the family members, who had less time to spend together are adjusting to the new norm of ‘more family time.’

Sudhakar sent six works to the virtual group show at Gangneung Art Centre.

206,2020/10/23,Ishrat Jahan case | CBI court refuses discharge plea of three police officers,"Court asks agency to get nod to prosecute the three policemen.

A special CBI court on Friday rejected the discharge applications moved by three policemen, including IPS officer G.L. Singhal, accused in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan alleged fake encounter case in Gujarat.

Besides Mr. Singhal, other petitioners are retired Deputy Superintendent of Police Tarun Barot and Sub Inspector Ananu Chaudhary.

A fourth accused, retired Deputy SP J.G. Parmar, who had also moved a discharge plea, passed away recently.

In an order on Friday, Special CBI court judge V.R. Raval refused to drop proceedings against the three accused and directed the prosecution agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation, to get prosecution sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure from the Gujarat government.

As per the laid down procedure under the section, government sanction is necessary for the prosecution of a public servant for an act done as part of official duty.

The court in its ruling admitted that the the policemen were discharging official duty and noted the probe agency CBI has not initiated “any process for getting sanction” from the State authorities as required under the law.

“The accused are involved in a serious case as there is an encounter by the accused police officers. Therefore, when it was established the accused acted while performing their official duties, the CBI ought to have got sanction. CBI should be directed to go for sanction for prosecution or to make declaration in this regard,” the court noted in its order.

In their pleas moved before the special court, the accused police officers sought discharge from the trial contending that the investigating agency had not obtained the mandatory sanction from the government, and on grounds of parity as other accused were granted discharge last year after the State government refused to sanction prosecution, they too must be discharged from facing the trial.

Last year, the same CBI court had dropped proceedings against former police officers D.G. Vanzara and N.K. Amin in the fake encounter case after the Gujarat government refused to grant sanction to the CBI to prosecute them.

Both Mr. Vanzara and Mr. Amin were among the top accused in the sensational alleged fake encounter case in which Mumbra girl Ishrat Jahan and three others were allegedly killed by the cops dubbing them as terrorists.

Earlier in 2018, the CBI court had also discharged former Gujarat in charge DGP P.P. Pandey in the case. He too was a key accused and was arrested by the agency in the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1yjhft/article32931424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THISHRAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cbi-court-refuses-discharge-plea-of-3-officers-in-ishrat-case/article32931425.ece
207,2020/10/23,Congress lists unkept promises ahead of PM’s campaign,"Opposition raises issues of special status for Bihar.

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the campaign trail in Bihar, the Congress on Friday asked if Mr. Modi will show ‘courage’ to announce special status for the State and posed several other questions on the promises that the Prime Minister had made to the people in the run up to the 2015 Assembly polls.

Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala, who has been camping in Patna to oversee the party’s election campaign, said Mr. Modi would once again try to ‘mislead, confuse and divide’ the 12 crore people of Bihar.

“Will PM Modi today show the courage to announce special status for Bihar?” he asked, dding that Union Power Minister R. K. Singh had already ‘dismissed’ such a demand.

Posing 10 questions, Mr Surjewala targeted the BJP and the Prime Minister for not ‘honouring’ their previous announcements.

“In the last election, the announcement to construct a Central University in Bhagalpur at a cost of ₹500 crore won much applause but not even a single brick has not been laid,” Mr. Surjewala said.

The Congress leader said though Mr. Modi had announced a Skill Development University at a cost of ₹1,550 crore, it simply vanished after the elections.

“Why was it taken to Varanasi? Why did you lie about electricity generation in Bihar? What happened to the 1300 MW thermal power plant to be built at a cost of ₹10,000 crore in Chausa, Buxar?” he said.

The Congress general secretary also cited several infrastructure projects including the Shri Ram-Janaki road in Bihar worth ₹4,000 crore and the four-lane road from U.P. border to Siwan-Madhubani-Sitamarhi on the Indo-Nepal border.

“Why did Modi government cheat ‘Siyaram’? Where did ₹100 crore of Ramayana Circuit’s go missing in Bihar which was announced by Modi ji? Why did Modi government refuse to construct a museum on the life of Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the ‘Prakatya Sthal Complex’ in Purona, Sitamarhi?” Mr. Surjewala asked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gobn6n/article32732883.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SURJEWALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/congress-lists-unkept-promises-ahead-of-pms-campaign/article32930536.ece

An FIR was lodged against the three men.

Senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Friday took a dig at the BJP for “mocking” RJD over its 10 lakh jobs promise and then itself talking about creating 19 lakh jobs in its Bihar election manifesto, saying he did not know that 19 was a smaller number than 10.

In its Bihar election manifesto released on Thursday, the BJP sought to reach out to the youth with the promise of 19 lakh jobs in the next five years.

“After mocking the RJD for promising to create 10 lakh jobs, the NDA has promised to create 19 lakh jobs in Bihar if elected,” Mr. Chidambaram tweeted.

“I did not know that 19 was a smaller number than 10. I think I should go back to primary school,” he said.

210,2020/10/23,Former Maharashtra BJP leader Eknath Khadse joins NCP,"Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Khadse had blamed Mr. Fadnavis for “trying to destroy his life” and political career.

Former Maharashtra BJP leader Eknath Khadse on Friday joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the presence of the party’s chief Sharad Pawar.

Sulking since his unceremonious exit from the Devendra Fadnavis-led Ministry in 2016 over land grab allegations, Mr. Khadse (68) on Wednesday quit the BJP. The same day, State NCP chief Jayant Patil announced he would be joining the Pawar-led party.

NCP is part of the ruling alliance in the State along with Shiv Sena and Congress, whose Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government assumed office 11 months ago. Mr. Khadse, former Maharashtra Revenue Minister and also an former Leader of Opposition in State Assembly, was inducted into the NCP at the party’s head office in Mumbai.

The leader, who flew to Mumbai on Thursday from his native Jalgaon district in north Maharashtra, was in political wilderness during the last four years, though he quit the BJP only two days ago.

Mr. Khadse’s formal entry into NCP, scheduled at 2 p.m., was delayed by over an hour as Pawar was in a meeting with party Minister Jitendra Awhad. Jayant Patil welcomed Mr. Khadse in the party, by offering him a scarf.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Khadse had blamed Mr. Fadnavis for “trying to destroy his life” and political career, over three decades of it spent in strengthening the BJP in Maharashtra.

Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren has expressed his displeasure to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the deduction of ₹1,417 crore as power dues of Damodar Valley Corporation, contending that it has “soured” relations of the State government with the Centre.

In a letter to Mr. Modi, Mr. Soren said, the step was unconstitutional and hurt the federal structure of the country.

“Due to this deduction, relations between Jharkhand and the central government have soured,” he said.

Mr. Soren said the total power dues of DVC was ₹5,500 crore, out of which, ₹1,417 crore was debited from the State’s account, which was “neither justified nor constitutional“.

The Chief Minister urged the PM to return the amount and ensure that such deductions do not happen in the future in view of the pandemic.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has announced the COVID-19 vaccine will be administered free to the poor, ahead of the byelection to 28 Assembly seats.

After the BJP promised Bihar residents free vaccination against COVID-19 in its Assembly election manifesto, Mr. Chouhan said, “Control over the COVID-19 pandemic has been achieved to a great extent in Madhya Pradesh, but the permanent cure is a vaccine. The State government has decided the COVID-19 vaccine will be administered free to the poor who can’t afford it.”

The Congress has previously accused the BJP of delaying its response to the pandemic in view of the political turmoil in March, which brought down its government. Only after Mr. Chouhan was sworn in as the Chief Minister was the nationwide lockdown imposed a day later.

Stating the State government’s effort was to protect the poor, Mr. Chouhan said, “Madhya Pradesh has previously given support to the poor on several counts, now it will ensure their protection from COVID-19 too.”

Alleging Mr. Chouhan had made a U-turn on his previous announcement that the vaccine would be provided to all residents free, State Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Now he is saying it will be administered to the poor who’re not financially capable. A classification even among the poor?”

He added, “Looking at the threat posed by the pandemic, he should make the vaccine available free to all citizens of Madhya Pradesh.”

“A COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been developed, still there is an announcement to distribute it free,” said K.K.

215,2020/10/23,"For U.P. CM, trademark tough talk in Bulandshahr","Social distancing gets the go-by at Adityanath’s bypoll rally

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath invoked the Kandhla and Kairana Hindu exodus controversy of 2016 and the killings that allegedly triggered the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots at an election rally in Bulandshahr on Thursday.

Scheduled for November 3, the bypoll to the Bulandshahr Sadar seat has been necessitated because of the demise of sitting BJP MLA Virendra Sirohi in March. The party has fielded his spouse Usha Sirohi in what seems like a triangular contest between the BJP, the Bahujan Samaj Party, and the Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal combine.

Mr. Adityanath talked about his government’s commitment to providing protection to “bahu, beti aur kisan (wife, daughter, farmer)” but didn’t mention the Hathras case where a Dalit girl was allegedly gang-raped and killed by four upper-caste men. He didn’t defend the three Central farm laws either.

Instead, he focussed on “bulldozing the property of the mafia” and filling the criminals with fear. In the same vein, he criticised the Congress and SP for allegedly showing sympathy towards the members of Popular Front of India. Before him, the BJP leaders on stage talked about the action being taken against politicians facing criminal cases such as Mukhtar Ansari and Atique Ahmed but there was no mention of gangster Vikas Dubey.

Many feel the CM’s rally was triggered by the massive response that RLD chief Ajit Singh’s rally evoked last week. In a bid to nullify the possible traction of Jat/farmer vote towards the RLD, the BJP scored a significant coup by roping in six-time MLA and senior SP leader Kiran Pal Singh, who joined the party during the rally.

The audience went into raptures when the Chief Minister mentioned that the PM had finally put a date to the construction of Ram Temple. “Khush ho (Are you happy),” he asked twice.

In the Jat belt, Mr. Adityanath chastened Aligarh Muslim University for not being able to recognise the contribution of Raja Mahendra Pratap.

He invoked Chaudhary Charan Singh and said his government has fulfilled the dreams of the former Prime Minister by increasing the capacity of Ramala Sugar Mill in Baghpat.

After that, he reminded of the PM’s “sabka saath, sabka vikas” goal and said unlike previous governments, his government’s recruitment policy was fair and inclusive.

For Bulandshahr, he offered a medical college and reminded how the upcoming international airport in the neighbouring Jewar and Film City in Noida would provide opportunities to the youth of the district.

Norms flouted

The CM kept reminding the audience of the importance of wearing masks and following “do gaz ki doori (social distancing)” but the modest exhibition ground was bursting at the seams with audience flouting norms.

In fact, the party workers could be heard directing the police not to stop people from entering the venue.

Santosh Kumar Singh, the Bulandshahr SSP, said it was impractical to stop supporters once they turned up at the venue. “We could only ensure that police officials wore masks and offered sanitisers to people.”

Some saw a business opportunity in the crowd. Pradeep Gupta could be seen distributing pamphlets for women’s wear. “After a long time, I had seen so many people together.

216,2020/10/23,‘Akalis would block Centre’s farm laws after forming govt. in Punjab’,"Sukhbir Badal says his party would declare the State a ‘Principal Market Area’

Former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal said after forming government in the State, his party will block the implementation of the Centre’s agriculture laws.

He said the Akali Dal would declare the entire State a ‘Principal Market Area’ and repeal the amendments to Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) 2017, enacted by the Congress government.

“It was the duty of the government to ensure that the produce of the farmers is procured at Minimum Support Price for all the 22 crops for which the Centre annually declares MSP. We have been demanding that the assured marketing at MSP regime must not only continue but must also be expanded to cover all the listed crops. When the Akali Dal forms a government in the State, we will ensure that this demand is converted into an achievement. We will do anything for the farmers because they are the backbone of Punjab’s economy,” he said here.

Mr. Badal alleged that several farmer organisations have dismissed Punjab’s agriculture amendment Bills terming them meaningless. “Chief Minister Amarinder Singh should respond to the dismissive description of his Bills by these organisations,” said Mr. Badal.

Referring to the State farm Bills, Mr. Badal said under the garb of these legislations the Congress, in consonance with the BJP, wants to weaken the intensity of this movement by uprooting it from its base in the country’s most agrarian State.

“The Captain-BJP team misused the sacred precincts of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha to implement the Centre’s anti-farmer plans. It is shocking and painful that Punjab’s temple of democracy was misused yesterday [Tuesday] to endorse all the anti-farmer Acts of the Modi government,” said Mr. Badal.

Dushyant attacks CM

Separately, Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala accused Capt.Amarinder of deceiving farmers in the guise of Punjab farm Bills. “If Punjab CM truly cares about the farmers then he should pass a Bill to purchase crops like cotton, millets, sunflower instead of just wheat and paddy on MSP,” he said. “Why Congress-governed States do not pass Bills to buy crops at MSP in their States,” he asked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6jvhxv/article32923212.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22SUKHBIRBADAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/akalis-would-block-centres-farm-laws-after-forming-govt-in-punjab/article32923213.ece
217,2020/10/23,Hathras case: AMU to extendtenure of ‘terminated’ doctors,"The RDA had written to AMU V-C to withdraw the order

Aligarh Muslim University has agreed to extend the tenure of two Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College doctors, whose services were allegedly “terminated” for their remarks in connection with the case of alleged gang-rape and death of a Dalit woman in Hathras.

“On the request of the Chief Medical Officer of the hospital, received on Wednesday, the university has given its nod to the proposal to extend the tenure of the two doctors,” AMU spokesperson Omar Saleem Peerzada said over phone from Aligarh on Thursday.

The order ending the contract of the two doctors — Dr. Mohamnad Azeemudin and Dr. Obaid Imtiaz — was issued by Chief Medical Officer S. A. Zaidi on Tuesday, a day after the CBI team probing the gang-rape and death case visited the hospital.

The AMU authorities have denied the allegations of termination as “highly speculative” and said the two doctors were engaged “on a temporary one-month vacancy from September 9”. The Resident Doctors Association (RDA) had written a letter to the AMU Vice-Chancellor on Wednesday and urged him to take immediate steps to withdraw the termination order.

The letter signed by RDA president Mohammad Hamza Malik and general secretary Mohammad Kaashif stated that the action against the two doctors smacked of “vendetta politics” and was aimed at muzzling the right to freedom of expression.

The two doctors told reporters on Tuesday that “they were quite taken aback by this step because they had not been given a chance to present their view to the authorities”.

In response to a query by media persons, the two doctors had hinted that they might have paid the price for giving their opinion to some journalists who had visited the hospital in connection with the Hathras case.

The 19-year-old woman, who was assaulted and allegedly raped by four men, was under treatment at the hospital before being referred to Delhi. She died at a Delhi hospital later. Reported comments of one of the doctors contradicted the Uttar Pradesh police’s stand that the FSL report in the case found no traces of sperm, indicating that there was no rape.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hathras-case-amu-to-extendtenure-of-terminated-doctors/article32923185.ece
218,2020/10/23,‘Dalits will boycott BJP’s Baroda bypoll candidate’,"He is against quota, allege Cong. MLAs

Congress Dalit MLAs have said that BJP’s Baroda bypoll candidate Yogeshwar Dutt would face a complete boycott by Dalits and backward communities for making a statement against their rights and for his politics of creating social division to polarise the electorate.

Former Ministers and Congress Dalit legislators Geeta Bhukkal, Shakuntala Khatak, Balbir Valmiki, Jayveer Valmiki and Varun Mulana addressed a press conference in Gohana on Thursday and strongly objected to a tweet by Mr. Dutt two years ago and the anti-reservation statement made recently.

Former Minister Geeta Bhukkal said it was unfortunate that Mr. Dutt, who benefited from the sports category for the DSP post and availed of financial support, pointed a finger at the reservation provided to Dalits and backwards. “Yogeshwar Dutt has expressed his anti-reservation mindset many times. In a tweet two years ago and his statement in an interview two days ago, he spoke about ending the reservation of Dalits and backwards. The entire Dalit society and backward classes condemn and oppose it,” she said.

Jaiveer Valmiki, MLA from Kharkhauda, said the RSS often talks of ending reservations and Mr. Dutt wants to pursue the same campaign. “If people of such mindset and views reach the Assembly by mistake, then their mission will not be to serve the people but to advance their agenda,” he said.

Economic criteria

Geeta Bhukkal said Mr. Dutt talks about reservation on economic basis, but he does not know that Haryana, under the leadership of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, was the first State in the country to give reservation on economic ground.

“The aim of Yogeshwar, BJP or RSS is not to give reservation on economic grounds, but to end the reservation of all classes. Therefore, now every section of society has to decide whether such people should be voted or boycotted,” she added.

219,2020/10/23,"We shall take back our streets, say activists","They highlight importance of protests

A number of activists on Thursday spoke about the importance of protests in a democracy and said that “we shall take back our streets”.

The speakers included author and activist Arundhati Roy, advocates Prashant Bhushan and Sanjay Hegde, United Against Hate co-founder Nadeem Khan, theorist Nivedita Menon, activist Bezwada Wilson and Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav.

The panel said that “the state and the police” have begun to criminalise protests. “Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone, said the Supreme Court. Was the Dandi March taken along designated routes? Was Jallianwala Bagh the massacre of a gathering by permit in a designated spot?” Concerned Citizens’ Collective said.

The panel stated that democracy doesn’t mean elections alone but it’s exercised when one can speak freely included in public spaces. “Why do people protest? Because they experience injustice and inequality, and as long as States remain unresponsive and mute, people need to be heard and to be seen,” they said adding that protests have affected social, political and legislative change.

“Jab sadkein suni ho jaati hai, toh sansad awaara ho jaata hai,” said Mr. Yadav. “Before you charge me of contempt, let me tell you that this is Ram Manohar Lohia’s quote. It talks about the deep relation between democracy and contestation”. He also said that it is unfortunate that some of the observations of our judges today are only emboldening the stifling of dissent.

Mr. Khan said that same police who claimed to have been unable to open the pattern lock of the accused in the case of forced disappearance of Najeeb Ahmed in JNU, are now confiscating hundreds of phones of activists to frame them for attending protests.

“Over the last few years, he said, dissent is being muzzled, tampered and violated. But I am hopeful. Our generation fought, future generations will also follow,” said Mr. Hegde.

Ms. Roy said, “It is humiliating to live in an atmosphere where people are constantly marinated in hatred.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/we-shall-take-back-our-streets-say-activists/article32922797.ece
220,2020/10/23,Kapil Dev ‘stable’ after angioplasty,"Had a heart attack in the early hours of Friday

Kapil Dev, the 1983 World Cup-winning captain, underwent an angioplasty during the early hours of Friday at Escorts hospital here.

Past midnight, the 62-year-old Kapil felt pain in his chest and was rushed to the hospital. Following an angiogram, a single block was found and a team of doctors performed angioplasty.

On Friday, the hospital released a statement that read: “Currently, Kapil is in ICU and under the close supervision of Dr. Atul Mathur and his team. He is stable now and he is expected to get discharged in a couple of days.”

Good wishes

Well-wishers and cricketers took to social media to wish him a speedy recovery.

“Take care @therealkapildev! Praying for your quick recovery. Get well soon Paaji,” tweeted Sachin Tendulkar, while Virat Kohli wrote “praying for your speedy recovery. Get well soon paaji”.

Another World Cup-winning former India cricketer Yuvraj Singh said, “Dear paji. Praying for your speedy recovery! Get well soon please ...after cricket I still need some golfing lessons.”

“Wishing the @therealkapildev a swift recovery. The nation is well aware of his grit and spirit and we are very sure he will be out of the hospital soon,” said the BCCI in its message.

India batsman Shikhar Dhawan and badminton player Saina Nehwal also conveyed their good wishes.

Later, the great all-rounder tweeted a statement which read “Thank you everyone for all the love and concern. I am overwhelmed with the good wishes and well on the road to recovery.”

221,2020/10/23,Indian Premier League 2020 | Morris effusive in praising Padikkal,"Says he is is the future of Indian cricket

Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) all-rounder Chris Morris hailed teammate Devdutt Padikkal as the ‘future of Indian cricket’. Opener Padikkal, RCB’s second highest run-scorer in the tournament after Virat Kohli, bears resemblance to former Australia batsman Matthew Hayden, Morris added.

“Devdutt has been incredible. He has an imposing way of batting, similar to Matthew Hayden. Devdutt does not have Hayden’s physical size, but he has a similar technique with the way he hits the ball. He is a great athlete, which is important. He is the future of Indian cricket,” Morris said, in a media interaction on Friday.

Praise for Washington

The South African had high praise for other Indian players in RCB as well. “Washington Sundar is coming into his own now. It feels like he has been playing IPL since he was 13 (laughs). Washington has the ball on a string,” Morris said.

“I was with (Navdeep) Saini during my time with Delhi Daredevils. Saini was a net bowler then. I couldn’t believe that he wasn’t playing because he was bowling at rocket speed. It’s great to see him become an India international now.”

On Siraj, the hero in Wednesday’s match against Kolkata Knight Riders, Morris said, “Siraj worked hard with Dale Steyn to get his seam position right. To see Siraj execute that in the match was incredible. The impressive thing about the Indian fast bowlers is their work rate. They just bowl, bowl and bowl.”

With nine wickets in five matches, at a terrific economy rate of 5, Morris is another vital part of the RCB bowling unit. The 33-year-old is returning from an injury which forced him to miss the early stage of the tournament.

Hard graft

“I got the injury while batting. I played a shot and tweaked a stomach muscle. It was the first time I got an injury like that. The medical staff and I worked very hard to set it right. I had to wake up every two hours at night to get on the rehab machine. It was four weeks of hard graft,” Morris said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dxvk53/article32932293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24PADIKKAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-morris-effusive-in-praising-padikkal/article32932294.ece
222,2020/10/23,"Indian Premier League 2020 | CSK’s cup of woes overflows, suffers eighth loss","After Boult and Bumrah rip through the Chennai line-up, Ishan and de Kock apply the finishing touches

After losing its last game in a humdinger that required two Super Overs, Mumbai Indians recovered well to produce a clinical display and thrash a hapless Chennai Super Kings by 10 wickets at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Friday.

The victory was set up by its pacers, Trent Boult (4/18) and Jasprit Bumrah (2/25), who ran through the CSK batting line-up and restricted the side to 114 for nine.

Ishan Kishan (68 n.o., 37b, 6x4, 5x6) and Quinton de Kock (46 n.o., 37b, 5x4, 2x6) then feasted on the CSK bowlers as the chase ended in just 12.2 overs. Ishan, in particular, was brutal against Deepak Chahar and Josh Hazlewood, clubbing the duo through the off-side at will.

The win takes MI top of the table with 14 points, while CSK is all but out of the competition following its eighth defeat.

Early jolts

Keiron Pollard, who was leading Mumbai in the absence of an injured Rohit Sharma, asked CSK to bat first, and the decision proved correct from the first over. The two speed-merchants wreaked havoc in the first three overs by picking up four wickets. CSK could never really recover from there.

In the first over, Boult removed opener Ruturaj Gaikwad leg-before with a delivery that swung in, after having set him up with a few that went across the right-hander.

In the next over, Bumrah picked up two wickets off consecutive deliveries. First, Ambati Rayudu couldn’t control his pull against a well-directed bouncer and the ball lobbed up off his glove and into wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock’s safe hands. Then, Bumrah had N. Jagadeesan caught at slip, the latter playing away from the body.

Prized scalp

Boult then had Faf du Plessis caught behind as he went for an expansive drive. CSK had lost four wickets with just three runs on board and finished the PowerPlay with the score reading 24 for five.

Sam Curran was the only batsman to show grit and fighting spirit, and he guided the lower-order well even as he tried picking boundaries himself whenever possible, making a valiant 52 off 47 balls as CSK scored 114.

Curran added 43 runs with Imran Tahir for the ninth-wicket – the highest of the innings – to avoid the ignominy of CSK failing to reach even 100. The result was humiliating nonetheless.

224,2020/10/23,"Delhi Capitals eye collective batting effort to keep place at top, KKR aim to stay in hunt","KKR are heading into the contest after an embarrassing batting performance against Royal Challengers Bangalore.

Table-toppers Delhi Capitals would expect more from their batsmen after an underwhelming performance in the loss to Kings XI Punjab when they take on a low-on-confidence Kolkata Knight Riders in an IPL game in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

For Delhi, opener Shikhar Dhawan has been in brilliant form but even his record-setting hundred was not enough to save the side from a defeat against Kings XI Punjab for lack of contribution from other batters.

Young Prithvi Shaw needs to bat with more responsibility at the top since Dhawan may not be able to rescue the side all the time. Shaw’s last four innings have included two ducks.

Skipper Shreyas Iyer too has not been hitting the ball as fluently as he was before suffering a side strain. Rishabh Pant, who made a comeback from injury against Punjab, too has not yet set the stage on fire.

Also read: Wake up call for us, we should take more responsibility, says Shreyas Iyer

Iyer and Pant, along with Marcus Stoinis, form the backbone of Capitals’ middle order. They are vital cogs in DC’s wheels and need to do more than just making good starts.

Pacer Anrich Nortze, who has been instrumental in Capitals’ superb run thus far along with his South African compatriot Kagiso Rabada, had a niggle and missed the last match against Punjab.

If he comes back, it will add sting to DC’s attack. If he plays, Australian pacer Daniel Sams will have to make way for him.

KKR are heading into the contest after an embarrassing batting performance against Royal Challengers Bangalore.

Blown away by Mohammed Siraj’s furious spell, KKR managed just 84 runs on the board. It certainly was a confidence-crushing defeat and KKR need to regroup quickly. Sitting at fourth place in the table with 10 points, they would be desperate to increase their tally to stay alive in the play-offs race. Even the change in captaincy has not instilled much confidence in the side.

The performance of pacer Lockie Ferguson has been the only bright spot for them amid the disappointment of Andre Russell’s poor run.

Russell missed out on the last match due to an injury and it will be interesting to see if the team management reposes faith in him, if he is fit.

KKR needs a collective effort from now on with skipper Morgan, Dinesh Karthik, Shubhman Gill, Nitish Rana all required to contribute.

225,2020/10/23,Battle of survival on cards as resurgent KXIP face SRH,"SRH finds itself in similar position and needs to win its remaining four matches.

Their campaign back on track with a hat-trick of wins, Kings XI Punjab will take on another resurgent team – Sunrisers Hyderabad – here on Saturday in a must-win IPL game for the two well-matched sides.

Both KXIP and SRH are on the same pedestal, having garnered eight points apiece after 10 games, but the Hyderabad outfit is a rung ahead in the eight-team standings, on the fifth spot by virtue of a better net run rate.

And both the teams need to win their remaining four games to guarantee their place in the play-offs

It has been a terrific turnaround especially for KXIP after a slow start to the tournament.

After the initial hiccups, KXIP got its campaign back on track with three consecutive wins — over mighty Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore and the KL Rahul-led side would be hoping to carry the winning momentum forward to break into top four.

While KXIP’s batting is in the safe hands of skipper Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Chris Gayle and Nicholas Pooran, the shaky form of Glenn Maxwell remains a concern.

It has been an erratic season for KXIP so far despite having the tournament’s top two run-getters in openers Rahul (540) and Mayank Agarwal (398) in its ranks.

But the successful return of Gayle has been a welcome relief for KXIP as it reduced the burden on the shoulders of its star openers, especially allowing Rahul to play more freely.

Jimmy Neesham’s inclusion has given some depth to KXIP’s batting as well bowling unit led by the experienced Mohammed Shami.

SRH too finds itself in similar position and needs to win its remaining four matches to seal a play-off berth.

The side managed to keep itself in the play-off hunt with a confidence-boosting eight-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals on Thursday night after three consecutive defeats.

And the David Warner-led side can’t slip a bit from hereon if it wishes to stay alive in the tournament.

The positive for SRH is that despite Warner and Jonny Bairstow departing early in the 155-run chase against RR in their last match, young Manish Pandey (83) and Vijay Shankar (52) rose to the occasion and shared an unbeaten 140-run partnership to secure a comfortable win.

Jason Holder’s inclusion has added firepower to SRH’s bowling attack as the West Indian picked up three wickets for 33 runs against RR.

But it’s high time that SRH’s young guns – Priyam Garg, Abdul Samad and T Natarajan – own up some responsibility.

Teams (from):

Sunrisers Hyderabad: David Warner (C), Jonny Bairstow, Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey, Shreevats Goswami, Virat Singh, Priyam Garg, Wriddhiman Saha, Abdul Samad, Vijay Shankar, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Jason Holder, Abhishek Sharma, B Sandeep, Sanjay Yadav, Fabian Allen, Prithvi Raj Yarra, Khaleel Ahmed, Sandeep Sharma, Shahbaz Nadeem, Siddharth Kaul, Billy Stanlake, T Natarajan, Basil Thampi.

226,2020/10/23,Misbah wants World Test Championship extended to ensure fair chance for all teams,"His statement comes amid reports that the ICC is considering splitting points for unplayed games in the championship cycle.

Pakistan’s head coach Misbah-ul-Haq wants the ICC to conduct the World Test Championship exactly the way it has been planned even if it means extending the duration of the event due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Misbah’s statement came amid reports that the ICC is considering splitting points for unplayed games in the championship cycle which was originally scheduled to end in June-July 2021 with the final in England.

“The COVID-19 situation has hit the World Test Championship series but I would still prefer to see the ICC complete the championship with all teams completing their scheduled matches,” Misbah said in an interview on the Cricket Baaz channel on You Tube.

It was reported that the ICC’s cricket committee, which meets next month, will consider two options — splitting points or consider only those matches played by end of March and base final positions on the percentage of points sides have won from those they’ve contested.

“I think the matches can be rescheduled because every team should get a fair chance to take a shot at qualifying for the final,” Misbah said.

The former Pakistan captain felt that the league can be extended to accommodate matches hit by the pandemic.

Pakistan’s one Test against Bangladesh in April has not been played due to the pandemic. Other countries have also had several of their scheduled series disrupted due to the pandemic.

“It is now up to the ICC. I don’t know how they will manage things and I hope it is for the best but personally I would think all teams would want a proper closure off the championship,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/3gf8j7/article32915449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MISBAH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/misbah-wants-world-test-championship-extended-to-ensure-fair-chance-for-all-teams/article32926239.ece

231,2020/10/23,Man arrested for murder of transgender,"The Coimbatore City Police on Friday arrested a man on charges of murdering M. Sangeetha (59), a transgender entrepreneur and head of one of the transgenders’ associations in Coimbatore district.

The police said R. Rajesh (23) from Nagapattinam district was working under Sangeetha at ‘Covai Trans Kitchen’, a biriyani joint inaugurated under her leadership on East Venkataswamy Road at R.S. Puram in September. He joined early in October and was staying with Sangeetha. As the accused allegedly began torturing her sexually, she threatened to file a complaint with the police against him. This led to her murder on Sunday night at her residence on N.S.R. Road in Saibaba Colony, following which he stuffed the body in a plastic barrel and sprinkled crystal salt on it and absconded, the police said.

The police registered a case and City Commissioner of Police Sumit Sharan had ordered the formation of two special teams to nab the accused.

‘Disheartening’

Transgender artist and writer Kalki Subramaniam termed the murder as “disheartening and condemnable.” “Such crimes against transgenders must be taken seriously by the police and the legal system,” she told The Hindu, adding that Sangeetha was a “very respected person in the [transgender] community.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/man-arrested-for-murder-of-transgender/article32933181.ece

233,2020/10/23,Fall in orders hits puffed rice production in Krishnagiri,"“Though there is a spike in retail demand, the production has already closed”

Senthil was compelled to scale down the production of puffed rice this Ayudha Puja season, something that he has not seen or heard about in the oral accounts of the family-run business passed on through four generations.

Krishnagiri is one of the largest producers of puffed rice that gets distributed across the State.

Senthil’s family-run ‘Amudha Pori Mandi’ supplies puffed rice to wholesalers in Chennai, Coimbatore, Salem and Tiruvannamalai. His famous puffed rice mandi, near the market in Krishnagiri town, has seen demand and fall through generations, but never like this one before.

“We had to cut down production by half this year,” says Senthil.

The puffed rice business took a hit this year, largely from the fall in orders that is usually sealed by the first fortnight of August. Now, the retail demand has increased, but the puffed rice producers have limited their production unwilling to take the chance fearing lukewarm response.

Usually the puffed rice production picks up after the pre-orders are sealed by August end. This year, with COVID-19 and extended lockdowns, orders came by only in September-end for the puffed rice producers.

“Orders start to come by the first and the second weeks of August. This year, we got orders only by September end, which was practically nothing.”

Every year, Puja season witnesses production and dispatch of over 30,000 sacks from his mandi. This year, his orders ranged between 15,000 to 17,000 sacks. “A sack contains 100 lts of puffed rice” With just two days to go for the festival, there is a sudden spike in retail demand, but the production has already closed to meet the demand.

“We need a minimum of four days to process puffed rice. There is no time now. But, irrespective of the demand, the price is the same ₹350 per sack,” says Senthil.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/pm6a65/article32933159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KA24PUFFRICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fall-in-orders-hits-puffed-rice-production-in-krishnagiri/article32933160.ece
234,2020/10/23,COVID-19: safety guidelines go for a toss at Flower Market,"On Friday, the scene at the Flower Market gave little indication that a battle was on in the city to control the COVID-19 spread. Very few people wore masks and there was hardly any adherence to the physical distancing norm.

The violation of the guideline that the State Government, district administration and the Coimbatore Corporation had been insisting upon came even as the civic body held a meeting a few streets away on T.V. Samy Street to caution people against such violations while shopping for the festive season.

Only a day ago, the district administration warned commercial establishments of stringent action for failure to ensure adherence to safety guideline on their premises.

But the caution from the authorities appears to have had no effect on flower vendors, who have occupied parts of Mecricar Road, Siva Subramaniam Street, Ramachandra Road and Devangapet to make the most of the Navaratri festive season.

The traders have not only occupied large tracts of motorable space but also placed their wares so close to one another that it is difficult to follow physical distancing norm among themselves and also among buyers, complains a trader.

The failure to monitor the crowd and enforce safety protocol has resulted in flower vendors and buyers moving around without masks or not wearing these properly, rues another trader on Mecricar Road.

Recalling that Flower Market and Devangapet were among the worst affected COVID-19 pockets in the city, the traders point out that if the Corporation does not monitor the situation and enforce safety guidelines, the infection can spread.

Meanwhile, at Friday’s meeting, Corporation Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian asked commercial establishments, particularly textile and jewellery showrooms, to ensure that customers followed physical distancing norm and wore masks, and their employees too followed the norms. He has also asked the shop owners to place hand sanitiser at entry points, disinfect shops and broadcast awareness messages.

The Commissioner has also instructed that flower vendors and buyers too followed safety norms, Corporation officials said.

On Thursday, Collector K. Rajamani had cautioned that it was important to strictly adhere to the COVID-19 safety guidelines because the district, particularly the city, would see movement of people from within and outside the district during the festive season.

He reminded the people that the State Government had relaxed various restrictions, the threat of COVID-19 infection spreading was potent.

Mr. Rajamani had also asked commercial establishments to desist from drawing crowd by advertising discounts or freebies and warned that the administration would seriously view violation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/covid-19-safety-guidelines-go-for-a-toss-at-flower-market/article32933133.ece

The police said the deceased, S. Soundar (23) of Boopathi Street, suffered a stab while trying to prevent an attack on his friend N. Elangovan (27).

One of the accused, Michael Antony (24), a resident of Cheran Ma Nagar and an autorickshaw driver, had borrowed ₹38,100 from Mr. Elangovan’s mother N. Bagyalakshmi (46) when he was a tenant in her house at Rajiv Gandhi Nagar at Thottipalayam Pirivu.

Michael vacated the house after Ms. Bagyalakshmi insisted on it because he was being a nuisance.

243,2020/10/23,Republic TV can’t use ‘Newshour’ but free to use tagline ‘Nation wants to know’ as part of speech: Delhi High Court,"Bennett Coleman had objected to use “Nation wants to know” by channel.

The Delhi High Court on Friday said Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami was free to use the tagline “nation wants to know” as part of his speech or presentation of any news channel.

Justice Jayant Nath, however, ordered Mr. Goswami and ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, which owns Republic TV, to maintain accounts if they choose to use the tagline as a trade mark with respect to any of their goods or services.

The High Court also restrained Republic TV and Mr. Goswami from using the trade mark ‘NEWS HOUR’ or any other mark which is deceptively similar to it, on a suit filed by media outlet Bennett Coleman and Co. Ltd, which owns the channel Times Now.

Bennett Coleman had argued that it has been using the tagline “nation wants to know” since 2006 for goods and services in relation to television broadcast. It has acquired goodwill and reputation due to the time effort, financial and human resources expanded by the company, it said.

The High Court, however, said it was only after evidence has been led that it can be ascertained as to whether Bennett Coleman was using the tagline as a trade mark or it was merely being used as a form of speech in the course of conducting the news channel.

“In these facts and circumstances, prima facie it is not possible, at this stage without leading of evidence, to come to a conclusion that the defendants (ARG Outlier Media and Mr. Goswami) seek to mislead the consumers of the news channel or that the action of the defendants in using the said tagline would cause damage to the plaintiff as claimed,” the High Court noted.

“A plea strongly urged by the defendants is that the tagline in question was used as a common speech for which there is no intellectual property which enures to the plaintiff,” it noted.

Mr Goswami, who was earlier associated with Times Now and resigned in 2016, launched his channel ‘Republic TV’ and website www.republicworld.com and later filed trade mark applications for registration of the mark ‘Nation Wants to Know’, ‘Arnab Goswami Newshour’ and ‘Goswami Newshour Sunday’ claiming proprietary rights.

On coming to know that Mr Goswami and Republic TV propose to adopt and use the trade mark or tagline, Bennett Coleman initiated its legal proceedings.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a82b0q/article31790525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMARNAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/republic-tv-cant-use-newshour-but-can-use-nation-wants-to-know-as-part-of-speech-hc/article32929248.ece

“Today is a remarkable day for Delhi. A state-of-the-art building with cutting-edge medical technology block being added at the hospital. With an additional 1,500 beds, this building will increase the overall capacity of Lok Nayak Hospital to 3,800 beds. In 2.5 years, it will be one of the biggest hospitals in the country with a modular design and modern medical infrastructure,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

The Delhi government, he said, has completed projects on time and that has saved money, which is then utilised for the betterment of the city.

Cost

Delhi, being the national capital, is a microcosm of the nation and should have access to everything world-class. The new wing at Lok Nayak Hospital is valued at ₹462 crores and each bed worth around ₹30 lakh.

“Other governments spend ₹1crore to ₹1.5 crore per bed, but we believe in smart spending and effective utilisation of budget. In the last five years, it has been of utmost importance that we improve the living standards of the people of Delhi,” Mr. Kejriwal also said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/c3f7me/article32927964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Arvind-Kejriwal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-cm-lays-foundation-for-new-block-at-lnjp-hospital/article32927965.ece

248,2020/10/23,Not being allowed to step out of cell: Umar Khalid,"Official pulled up for muting microphone

Former JNU student Umar Khalid, who was arrested under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection to the north-east Delhi riots case, on Thursday told a court here that he was not allowed to step out of his cell similar to “solitary confinement”.

Mr. Khalid made the allegation while he was being produced before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat through videoconferencing on expiry of his judicial custody in the case.

Mr. Khalid said that while there is a recent direction of the court to provide him security cover inside the jail, he was not allowed to talk to anyone. He said that when the jail superintendent visited him recently, he complained about the issue. Mr. Khalid said he was allowed to step out of his cell for 10 minutes, but was put back inside his cell once the official left. Mr. Khalid said he has not been allowed to step out since then.

Official summoned

Taking note of the issue, Judge Rawat directed Tihar jail superintendent to be present before the court on Friday to hear the matter. The judge also pulled up the jail staff for muting the microphone of Mr. Khalid when the case was going on.

Mr. Khalid said that the official told him his microphone will be unmuted if the judge gave the permission for it.

The judge said if an undertrial wants to say something, then unmute and let him speak or the jail staff should tell us that he wants to say something. The judge also said that Mr. Khalid should not be punished for putting forward his grievances.

During the hearing, special public prosecutor moved an application for extending Mr. Khalid’s judicial custody by 30 days.

Earlier this week, a local court had ordered the Delhi police to supply to Mr. Khalid a copy of the FIR, remand application and remand order of the case related to the communal violence in which he was arrested. The court noted that it was a settled proposition of law that no person shall be detained in custody without being informed of the grounds for such arrest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/w3c5vo/article32923140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22DELPRIYAUMARKHALID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/not-being-allowed-to-step-out-of-cell-umar-khalid/article32923142.ece
249,2020/10/23,"Small, improvised ceremonies to mark Dussehra celebrations","Special effects to stage symbolic effigy burning

After Ramlilas, Dussehra celebrations have contracted into local affairs due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While the biggest among such events has been cancelled due to caps on gatherings limiting attendance to 200, according to organisers, local functions featuring small effigies scheduled to be ‘burnt symbolically’ with the aid of lights or audio visual effects are being planned over the weekend.

Restrictions on religious gatherings, up to a maximum of 200 attendees, related to the festive season were lifted till October 31 by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in view of the pandemic. The directive, however, prescribed strict restrictions on activities ranging from setting up food stalls to standing or squatting when attending such events.

“Due to the restrictions on the number of attendees being allowed by the administration as well as the problem of air pollution, only small ceremonies with many improvisations are being organised this year,” said Ashok Goel Devraha, general secretary of the Delhi Dharmik Sangh which is an umbrella body that facilitates the organisers of Ramlilas. Over 700 Ramlilas are organised across the city every year, of which around a hundred are among the oldest and the most popular.

Many events cancelled

Ashok Agarwal of Luv Kush Ramlila Committee, one of the oldest Ramlila organisers in the city, said it had decided to cancel Dussehra celebrations and the Raavan dahan this year would be a televised repeat of last year’s festivities. “There is no other option; we would rather improvise like this and maintain our connection with crores of patrons across the world online than risk our lives,” he said.

Rajesh Gehlot, chief patron of Dwarka Sri Ram Leela Society, a traditional crowd-puller in Sector 10 where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in attendance last year, said the pandemic had, like everything else, affected the preparation of effigies as usual. “The number of people allowed to gather, that is 200, is actually the number of people we employ to prepare the three effigies to be burnt. We have decided to cancel this year,” he said.

Among the smaller events, will be a narration-based staging of the traditional 10-day Ramlila crunched into four days leading up to the Raavan dahan aided by lighting in south Delhi, and another being planned as a three-hour gala in east Delhi.

Anil Sharma of the R.K. Puram Ramlila Religious Committee said the event would unfold between October 22 and October 25.

“There are many episodes of the Ramayana which, because of time constraint, will not be staged but narrated so that we can conclude on Dussehra. There will be no traditional burning of the effigies; we will use lights and sound effects to stage a symbolic effigy burning of Raavan, Kumbhkaran and Meghnad,” Mr. Sharma said.

Satish Aggarwal of East Delhi’s Shri Balaji Ramlila Committee said they would stage the epic, followed by a dahan within three hours on Sunday. “We are in the process of getting the requisite permissions and will not be burning the effigies; we will use lights and other effects for the purpose,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/t0psbn/article32923129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22OCTPRIYARAMLILA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/small-improvised-ceremonies-to-mark-dussehra-celebrations/article32923130.ece

An HC Bench said the top court on October 16 had constituted a committee headed by its former judge Justice Madan B. Lokur to monitor the steps taken by these States to prevent stubble burning.

The court disposed of the application, which was moved by advocate Sudhir Mishra, in his main petition filed in 2015 — seeking directions to the Centre to take immediate steps to control increasing air pollution in the Capital.

The application had contended that stubble burning would increase the air pollution drastically in the Capital and could further aggravate the health problems in the city in view of the pandemic.

Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma said the sun was not visible on Thursday and it was an emergency-like situation in the Capital due to the “poor” air quality.

254,2020/10/23,DU power tussle over appointment escalates,"Education Ministry backs Pro V-C as Vice-Chancellor attempts to replace him

The power tussle between Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Yogesh K. Tyagi and Pro Vice-Chancellor P.C. Joshi on Wednesday over the appointment of the Registrar ended with the latter being replaced a day later.

On directions of the V-C, Dr. Geeta Bhatt, who is also the Director of the Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB), was appointed as the Pro V-C on Thursday. The move came hours after Mr. Joshi notified Vikas Gupta as the varsity’s Registrar following the Executive Council meeting that took place on Wednesday chaired by the former.

Earlier on Wednesday, professor P.C. Jha had been appointed as the Registrar and Director of South Campus following which he issued a notification to postpone the EC meeting for a revision of agenda items. However, Mr. Joshi went ahead with the EC meeting and even wrote a letter to Mr. Jha asking him to “vacate the Registrar’s office.” This was followed by a communication from the university terming the EC meeting as illegal.

“P.C. Joshi, Pro V-C, decided to go ahead and conduct the Executive Council meeting in which professor Suman Kundu participated as Director of South Campus and In-charge Registrar. This is in complete violation of the [earlier] notification. This meeting, therefore is illegal and void,” it had read.

EC member Rajesh Jha said that the meeting held on Wednesday was in accordance with the statutes of the varsity. The Academics for Action and Development said: “The internal factional fight has caused irreparable damage to the functioning of the University of Delhi. The greed to grab the choicest positions in the university administration and colleges have virtually unleashed a gang war in the Vice-Regal Lodge.”

Mr. Joshi had been appointed Pro V-C on June 28 by the V-C. According to the varsity statute, the Pro V-C looks after the daily functioning in the absence of the V-C.

Ministry steps in

The Education Ministry wrote a letter supporting Mr. Joshi. In a letter addressed to Mr. Gupta, he stated that Mr. Tyagi’s order should be considered invalid, as he was on medical leave.

“...the order issued by the Vice Chancellor during his period of absence on medical ground without joining the office properly and officially is not valid and should not be acted upon by the university functionary. In future, if the VC wants to join the office, proper medical fitness certificate issued by the competent authority, who treated him, may be obtained,” said the letter sent on Thursday by Education Ministry Deputy Secretary Birendra Kumar Singh. It reiterates that Mr. Joshi will act as the VC.

The Ministry’s letter also notes that the Pro VC had written to the Education Ministry on Wednesday to inform it that Mr. Tyagi was not discharging his duty.

In a late night communication Mr. Gupta said: “It is hereby clarified that prof. Joshi, Pro VC will act as VC and is the only competent authority to approve or issue orders as per the provisions of the [DU] Act, statutes and ordinances of the university. Any notification or orders issued without the due approval of prof. Joshi are null and void.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ur9d9t/article32922934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL23-DU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/du-power-tussle-over-appointment-escalates/article32922935.ece

256,2020/10/23,Akbar-Ramani case sent backby Delhi court to previous judge,"Judge trying the defamation case had sought its transfer

A Delhi court on Thursday sent back former Union Minister M.J. Akbar’s defamation case against journalist Priya Ramani for her tweets accusing him of sexual harassment to the judge who was hearing it for the past two years.

Judge Vishal Pahuja, who was trying the defamation case, had earlier this month sent the matter to the Principal District and Sessions Judge seeking its transfer to another court on the ground that his court was now designated to hear cases filed against lawmakers pursuant to a recent verdict of the Supreme Court.

On September 16, the apex court had asked the Chief Justices of all High Courts to list before an appropriate Bench all pending criminal cases involving sitting and former lawmakers where stay was granted.

In terms of this order, certain cases that did not pertain to sitting and former lawmakers, but were already being heard by Mr. Pahuja were transferred to other courts. Principal District and Sessions Judge Kohli on Thursday, however, sent the case back to the court of Judge Pahuja.

At the height of the ‘MeToo movement’ in 2018, Ms. Ramani accused Mr. Akbar of sexual harassment during his role as newspaper editor. Following this, about dozen of former colleagues of Mr. Akbar also came out with different allegations against him.

258,2020/10/23,A precious gem,"Thirumoolar in his Thirumandiram talks of Lord Siva’s Supremacy, said R. Narayanan in a discourse. The Agamas elaborate on His qualities. None of the celestials is equal to Him. No human being is equal to Him either, thus making Him head of the celestials and humans. He is Lord of all the worlds. Without Him, none of the celestials can carry out their duties. No penance will be fruitful if one does not realise Him. Golden hued Siva is a father and a mother to those who see Him as such. He is the One who creates everyone and everything.

Manickavachagar in his Thiruvachagam, Anda paguthi, says Siva is the ancient One (pazhaiyon) who created everything. In the Piditha pathu section, Manickavachagar addresses Siva as his mother and father. He describes Siva as a precious gem, and as nectar that results from love. He says he inhabits a body that will perish. He therefore holds on to Siva, who has granted him jnana. Just as Thirumoolar refers to Siva as the golden hued One, so does Sundarar, in his Ponnaar meniyane verse. Thirumoolar says that the long-haired Siva is hotter than fire, and yet when He gives, He is cooler than water. He keeps away from those who have not understood His qualities. His grace is only for those who love Him. If one sees the idol of Siva as God, then one earns His mercy. He is always present beside His devotees.

Saiva Siddhanta says that one can follow four paths to reach Siva, namely sariyai, kiriyai, yogam and jnanam. Sariyai is caring for all living things, serving in temples, serving His devotees. Getting spiritual instruction through a guru and worshipping Him is kiriyai. Doing yoga and meditation and reaching God is yogam. Passing through the first three stages and then realising that Siva is the ultimate One is jnanam.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/a-precious-gem/article32932499.ece
259,2020/10/23,Mind control,"In Srimad Bhagavatam, Lord Krishna tells Uddhava the story of a rich, but stingy merchant of Avanti, said P.T. Seshadri, in a discourse. When the merchant lost all his wealth, he realised the impermanence of wealth, turned over a new leaf and became a sanyasi. But people did not believe he was a true sanyasi, for they remembered how wicked he had been. They grabbed his danda, polluted his food, tore his garments and beat him up. Yet, he ignored all this and continued with his meditation.

When asked how he could be indifferent to such cruelty, he said, “For my sorrow or joy, my body is not the reason. God is not the reason either. My atma is not the reason. It is my mind that is the cause for joy or sorrow. The manas, trapped in the three gunas, makes us do karmas, So, we become attached to the world.”

The man who questioned the sanyasi then asked him how to control the mind. The sanyasi replied: “Do your svadharma. Daana is important. So, give generously to others. Listen to the recitation of the Vedas, Puranas and Itihasas. Sing the names of the Lord. Nama sankeerthana is important. All these actions will calm the mind. The senses are under the control of the mind. So, if you do not control the mind, you cannot control the indriyas. If you bite your tongue, which of your indriyas can be blamed for the pain you experience — the tongue or the teeth? Neither of them is at fault. Likewise, if you do not control your mind, can you blame others for your plight? Sorrows that result because of your actions cannot be blamed on others. If you do not control mind, you will treat others with discrimination. You will see some as friends and some as enemies. Only one who has controlled his mind will take to the right path, and seek moksha.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/mind-control/article32922855.ece

Congress has asked the Telangana government to be transparent in distributing financial aid to people affected by the flood and put the details of beneficiaries on the website.

In a statement, TPCC treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy asked the government to give figures of beneficiaries who have received ₹10,000 and put them in public domain. Though the government announced a relief package of ₹550 crore, he was doubtful about the proper distribution of it.

While the number of affected people was in lakhs, the number of beneficiaries was just in hundreds so far. About 1,500 colonies were affected by the city floods but the TRS leaders are visiting only a few places for relief disbursal. He alleged that even relief is being used for photo opportunities.

He wanted to know why the government was distributing cash instead of cheques, which would ensure that money would go to the right people. He criticised that many times in the past, whenever people faced natural calamities, funds given were used for publicity of the ruling party.

262,2020/10/23,"On Durgam Cheruvu bridge, you are on police radar 24x7","Fine for stopping vehicles, taking selfies

Commuters taking the newly-inaugurated Durgam Cheruvu cable-stayed bridge have to be more vigilant and follow traffic rules by not stopping the vehicles and taking selfies, as the facility is remotely monitored in real-time by the Cyberabad Traffic Police.

If anyone stops his vehicle to watch the picturesque lake, spectacular rock formation and take photographs, a blaring sound system will shoo them away. In case the motorist remains unheeded, a challan will be slapped in real-time for the violations.

On Wednesday evening, a man with his wife and two children, who halted his bike on the bridge to take photographs was fined ₹2,315.

Cyberabad Traffic DCP S.M. Vijay Kumar said that around 6.30 p.m. the man stopped the bike on a side of the cable bridge and soon his wife and kids got down and started taking photographs on a mobile phone.

Meanwhile, he covered the bike’s registration plate with his wife’s ‘dupatta’ to avoid challan.

When the alert policemen at the Central Command and Control Centre at Cyberabad headquarters noticed his activities via surveillance camera set up on the bridge, they warned the family using the public address system. “They were told that no stopping is allowed, and were asked to go away. Soon, the family fled from the spot,” Mr. Kumar told The Hindu.

However, the police managed to get the vehicle details and was challanned for ₹2,315 on charges of stopping on the carriageway, not wearing helmets (both rider and pillion rider), wilfully withholding vehicle information and triple riding, the officer said.

Mr. Kumar further urged the commuters not to stop on the cable bridge by violating the norms and put their lives at risk.

“Activities on the bridge are monitored very closely for the safety of the public,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/on-durgam-cheruvu-bridge-you-are-on-police-radar-24x7/article32931272.ece

Former MLA and AICC secretary Ch.Vamshichand Reddy has urged Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to call for a special session of the Assembly to enact our laws to override the Central government’s contentious agriculture laws.

In a letter to the Chief Minister, he said the Punjab government had enacted three laws in a special session to negate the Central laws, which were detrimental to the farmers. “You have openly opposed the new laws and show that spirit in calling for a special session and negate those laws,” he said.

He said the Chief Minster was well aware of the injustice being done to the farmers by Central government's unfair farm laws. “ Protesting alone will not resolve the problems faced by our farmers. The pressing priority should be to protect our farmers from falling prey to the union's flawed decisions,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kcr-asked-to-follow-in-punjabs-footsteps/article32922710.ece
265,2020/10/23,Kidnapper worked as temporary driver for police,"He did not want anyone to know about the phone calls he used to make to his girlfriend. That was when Manda Sagar knew, through a friend, about a mobile app of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology.

He allegedly used the same mobile app to make ransom calls to the parents of nine-year-old Deekshit Reddy in Mahabubabad town.

In fact, usage of this mobile app by the accused in the boy’s kidnap and murder became a hurdle to the investigators to reach him.

Though investigation revealed that the boy had been killed before his parents approached police about his disappearance, Sagar had been roaming in Mahabubabad town. “And he was making ransom calls to the boy’s parents even as multiple special teams of police were struggling to understand from where he was making calls,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity.

Sagar downloaded the app nearly a year ago to speak with his girlfriend. The app enables user to make calls using VoIP technology. A private number, other than that of the call maker’s, displays on the receiver’s mobile phone. This makes it difficult for the receiver or others to track the caller’s number.

Sagar reportedly secured two sleeping pills from a Registered Medical Practitioner after hatching the plot to kidnap the boy. He befriended the boy giving chocolates earlier.

On the day of kidnap, he requested the boy to accompany him to a nearby petrol bunk to purchase some oil.

He took the boy to a hillock where he convinced him to drink water laced with sleeping pill.

When the boy woke up after a couple of hours, Sagar allegedly throttled him to death. He came back to his house and went to the house of boy’s uncle Manoj Reddy to learn about the reaction of boy’s parents.

Sagar runs a two-wheeler spare parts shop. Sitting at the shop, he made ransom calls to the boy’s father Ranjith Reddy and asked him to come to a junction (called Three Shops) with money.

“He could see Ranjith sitting from his shop but grew suspicious of policemen in plainclothes moving there,” an officer said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/8h5g2o/article32925224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy22appcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kidnapper-worked-as-temporary-driver-for-police/article32922698.ece
266,2020/10/23,From a trade union leader to Home Minister,"He had been actively associated with TRS activities

Former Telangana Home Minister Nayani Narasimha Reddy, who died early on Thursday, was a trade union leader and a founder member of State unit of Hind Mazdoor Sabha, one of the five national trade unions. He was 86.He was diagnosed with pneumonia when he

was admitted to Apollo Hospitals on October 13 after he complained of breathlessness. The oxygen levels in his body were found to have dropped sharply.

Fondly called ‘Narsanna’, he is survived by wife, a son and a daughter.

Narasimha Reddy was born into an agricultural family in Neredugomma village near Devarakonda in erstwhile Nalgonda district. He joined politics attracted by the socialist ideology of Ram Manohar Lohia. He was Janata Party MLA twice from Musheerabad constituency in combined Andhra Pradesh in 1978 and 1985.

He plunged into the separate-Telangana movement after K. Chandrasekhar Rao floated the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in 2001. He had been actively associated with all the party activities ever since. In the absence of Mr. Rao, it was Mr. Narasimha Reddy who was given the responsibility of hoisting the national flag on occasions such as Independence and Republic Days at the party office.

He was also the party representative at several platforms on the demand for formation of Telangana State.

Elected for the third time as MLA from Musheerabad on TRS ticket in 2004, Mr. Narasimha Reddy was one of the six Ministers of the party to share power with the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy-led Congress government in the State.

The Telangana Rashtra Samithi pulled out of the alliance, both in UPA government at the Centre and the State, after two years. As Backward Classes Minister, Mr. Narasimha Reddy was in charge of YSR's native Kadapa district. He had lost a by-election in the term of the Assembly from 2004 to 2009 and the general elections in 2009.

After the formation of Telangana State in 2014, he was made Home Minister by Mr. Rao. He also handled the subjects of labour and employment.

As he was not a member of the Assembly, Mr. Narasimha Reddy was inducted into the Cabinet of Mr. Rao as a Member of the Legislative Council.

He was denied party ticket to contest Assembly elections in 2018. Mr. Narasimha Reddy was known for his tough appearance in spite of advancing age. The name ‘Bullet Narsanna’ became his sobriquet as he was familiar riding the Bullet two-wheeler before joining the Telangana Rashtra Samithi.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/from-a-trade-union-leader-to-home-minister/article32922672.ece

Former Home Minister and MLC Nayani Narasimha Reddy’s mortal remains were consigned to flames on Thursday with state honours in the presence of family members, Telangana activists and TRS leaders.

His body was taken from Ministers quarters at Banjara Hills to Mahaprasthanam – the cremation ground, with hundreds of his supporters following him for the final rites.

Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao was among the pall-bearers of the late leader and he was joined by several TRS leaders and Ministers. Nayani’s wife Ahalya, who was not keeping well was brought in a wheel-chair for her to pay the last respects. Police fired three rounds into the air as a mark of respect for the departed leader as the pyre was lit.

Legislative Council Chairman Gutha Sukhender Reddy, Ministers Eatala Rajender, Mahmood Ali, Sabitha Indra Reddy and A. Indrakaran Reddy, TRS Parliamentary Party Leader K Keshav Rao, State level farmers coordination committee chairman Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, GHMC Mayor Bonthu Rammohan were among those who attended the funeral.

Condolences

Earlier, the Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao expressed shock over the death and recalled his association with the late leader during the Telangana separate statehood movement and in the state government. The Cabinet colleagues of Mr. Rao and Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar paid floral tributes to the body at Ministers Quarters. They recalled their association with Narasimha Reddy.

Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan also expressed grief at the passing away of Telangana’s first Home Minister and said he toiled for the Telangana formation as an unrelenting activist and for its development as Minister.

“I extend heartfelt condolences on the unfortunate demise of the first Home Minister of Telangana State, former MLA, a fighter for Telangana statehood, leader of labour unions and a soft spoken mass leader Nayini Narsimha Reddy.”

Union Minister of State for Home, G. Kishan Reddy said Nayani was a tall trade unionist, who influenced Telangana movement with his astuteness in leading masses. BJP State president Bandi Sanjay and BJP national OBC president K. Lakshman recalled his contribution to Telangana movement as well as a trade unionist who spent time in jail during the Emergency period.

TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and working president A. Revanth Reddy remembered him for the role in Telangana movement and also as a trade union leader.

268,2020/10/23,"Rain fuels LPG demand, impacts supply in limited way","Nov-Jan is the peak consumption period, says IOC official

The impact of the downpour the city and suburbs received in recent days on LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) cylinder supplies was restricted to some pockets, but the rain is set to trigger the annual pattern of cooking gas consumption by households increasing a bit early.

An increase in refill bookings is being observed in recent days, Telangana LPG Distributor’s Association General Secretary K. Jagan Mohan Reddy said, attributing it to the rain. The monthly domestic LPG refill bookings, with the three public sector oil marketing companies together, in Telangana varies from around 47 to 51 lakh refills depending on the season.

As per early pointers for this month, the increase in refill bookings is 8-10% in the State, he said, adding it could be a temporary phenomenon. Apart from more time taken to cook, when day temperatures begin to drop, and the need to boil water for bathing, last week’s torrential rains is also bound to make it necessary for many households to boil water for consumption. On the rain impact on supplies, he said it was restricted to a few pockets primarily because of water logging in the areas where some of the LPG godowns were located. In turn, it marginally increased the wait time for households.

Executive Director and State Head of Indian Oil Corporation for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh R.Sravan S.Rao said the rain impact on last-mile distribution was limited to a few pockets that were inundated. Stating that the bottling plants of IOC functioned as usual, the backlog in supplies (wait from the time of booking) to households in Telangana as on Wednesday was 1.57 days, while in Andhra Pradesh it was 1.39 days.

In places where roads were breached, IOC took cooking gas cylinders to nearby places from the customers could pick them up. Mr.Rao said there was neither need for customers to panic nor was there shortage of cylinders “as all our bottling plants are functioning to the normal capacity. We have surplus capacity and are geared to handle the [additional] demand” that sets in from the festive season. November, December and January are the peak consumption period.” As a gesture, IOC on Wednesday donated life jackets to police and food packets to residents of some waterlogged areas in old city.

A senior official of Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) said contributing to the higher consumption would be many families who got free cylinders as part of the COVID-19 relief package from the government and like to continue using LPG.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ne48l4/article32922623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy22lpgcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rain-fuels-lpg-demand-impacts-supply-in-limited-way/article32922624.ece
269,2020/10/23,"Post-floods, onion prices bring tears to the consumers","The current retail market price per kilogram is anywhere between ₹ 100 and ₹ 130

Onion prices have hit the roof once again bringing tears to the working poor and middle class families. While many parts of the city are marooned and cut off from markets, the ubiquitous onion bulbs have become the most sought after. The current retail market price per kilogram is anywhere between ₹ 100 and ₹ 130.

With truncated salaries due to COVID-19, spending money on these storage roots are burning a hole in the pockets, complained Afzal Ali, a private employee from Humayunnagar. With heavy rains in the onion source markets like Kurnool in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the crop was submerged in rainwaters and farmers failed to reap their produce. Kurnool market yard, which used to get a daily average of 5,000 tonnes is now sliced down to less than 1,000 tons. This had upset the supply-demand matrices pushing up the prices consequently, said an market yard official. Hyderabad Onion Traders Association president Cheguri Venkat Ramana told The Hindu that the city requires at least 300 tonnes of onion per day and the supplies are now being procured from Maharashtra. Though arrivals are steady, the supply has become a major challenge due to recent floods, he said. Onion trading in the city takes place at Mahbub Mansion also known as Malakpet Gunj, State’s largest chilli and onion wholesale market.

The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at ₹ 4,000 and ₹ 9,000 per quintal, respectively on Wednesday. Prices have doubled in one week. The produce which is coming to the gunj is from Nasik, Solapur, Ahmednagar, and other districts of Western Maharashtra. “Whatever we are getting is a stock product. Even there the crop was damaged due to rains,” Mr. Venkat Ramana said. He said that the prices of the bulbs may see an uptrend in the short term.

According to him the white onion has become a premium, as only 100 tonnes arrived from Raichur in Karnataka on Tuesday and only 70 tonnes from Kurnool on Wednesday. Those who have turned into consuming organic farm products are finding that buying organic onions is now a luxury even for the well-to-do families.

The prices of other vegetables have also seen a traction in their prices making vegetable consumption very dear for the families. Some families are even going for alternatives like cooking without onions and by substituting tamarind with tomato.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/jfa8r6/article32922610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY22ONION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/post-floods-onion-prices-bring-tears-to-the-consumers/article32922611.ece

271,2020/10/23,CCMB incubated Clone Deals launches ‘CoronAID’,"The anti-COVID immunity food supplement is derived from a rare mushroom

‘CoronAid’, a nutraceutical anti-viral immunity booster oral suspension to boost immunity against COVID-19 has been unveiled by the city-based startup ‘Clone Deals’ on Friday.

The firm incubated at Atal Incubation Centre (AIC) of the CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) has made the ‘food supplement’ with a combination of powder from a rare mushroom ‘cordyceps militaris’ that grows in Himalayas only two months a year and is known for its immune boosting and anti-oxidant properties.

It has been mixed with curcumin, an active ingredient in turmeric, in collaboration with another firm - Ambrosia Food Company to make the product, which has obtained approval from the Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), said Prakash Ayodhya Pandem, Paul Venkatesh and M. Ateek Patel of ‘Clone Deals’.

CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra and AIC-CCMB chief executive officer N. Madhursuhana Rao launched the product said to be safe for all ages as it can be taken as a food supplement any time. Clone Deals has taken assistance of CCMB scientists to establish the potency of ‘cordycepin’ component - found in the mushroom, to establish potency in “stopping the growth of COVID-19 causing coronavirus in a cell culture system”.

The founders claimed the studies showed ‘cordycepin’ inhibits multiplication of coronavirus and that Clone Deals has the expertise in large-scale production of the mushroom in a controlled atmosphere for the medicinal use. “We have also sought government permission for conducting human clinical trials to establish the safety of the formulation to be used as potential medicine in the form of ‘cordyceps capsules’ with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Nagpur, Bhopal and Mahatma Gandhi Mission Institute of Health Sciences, (MGM) Navi Mumbai ,” they said.

Results of clinical trials are expected to be available from December when the product is expected to be available in most places of the country. “We hope ‘CoronaAID’ would be a New Year gift to the world and add considerable protection against the virus,” said Mr. Prakash, Mr. Venkatesh and Mr. Patel.

Dr. Mishra congratulated them and expressed pleasure in supporting the startup focused on developing indigenous natural products and adding value by establishing its scientific basis. Dr. Rao pointed out AIC-CCMB has been providing necessary infrastructure facilities and scientific support to startups like Clone Deals for validation of their technology and market readiness.

272,2020/10/23,Osman Nagar residents turn refugees near their own homes,"The low-income colony looks like a pool of water with houses surfacing up

Muhammad Iqbal has vacated his house that is surrounded by water and is now living in a rented house in another part of the city. Nasreen Begum and Fatima live yards away from their rented house which is ringed with shoulder-high water. Riyaaz comes everyday to see his house where all the family’s belongings are rotting in water.

They, and perhaps 300 other families in Osman Nagar, are refugees near their own homes.

“We sleep near the shops and other covered spaces and wait here for food and water being distributed by others. We have been reduced to begging,” says Fatima, who saw her few belongings get destroyed by gushing waters of the lake. But while other places in Hyderabad were marooned after the heavy rain of October 14, the Osman Nagar area has been under water for more than a month.

Lower rents

Most of the residents in the area were drawn to live here as the rents were low. “We paid ₹ 1,500 as rent but now all our belongings have been destroyed. And if we want to look for other places to move the house owners are asking ₹ 10,000 as deposit,” said Muhammad Saleem who works as a mason and lives in the colony.

Surrounded by rocks, the low-income colony now looks a pool of water with the odd house sticking out. Two local mosques have also been filled by the rising waters of the lake. Streams of volunteers from various Non-Governmental Organisations and good samaritans have been visiting the area and distributing food, water and medicines.

“We need food. But we also need a shelter. How long can be stay like this? The water can be drained and we will need help to clean the muck. Whenever I walk in the water to survey the damage at home it leaves an itch which stays for a long time,” says Riyaaz, who owns a house in the area. Identified as Shukur Sagar or Venkatapuram Lake, the spread of water was a huge sheet of water where the houses started coming up in 2009. “Only two times earlier did the water rise so high. Even during those years it receded within a week. But this year it is not receding at all,” says Muhammad Iqbal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/908p3x/article32922570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY22OSMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/osman-nagar-residents-turn-refugees-near-their-own-homes/article32922571.ece

While the Act was passed in 2018, the registration of health-care facilities began in 2019. Sub committees established under the Act had submitted reports on the draft regulations that would govern the functioning of the establishments.

“Apart from what was initially laid down by the Act, several other regulations have now been suggested by the sub committees. The minimum space requirement for the smallest lab under the regulations is 500 square feet. But expansion is not feasible for most labs. Besides, some labs are staffed just by one person. Now, according to these regulations at least one person who has studied under the Directorate of Medical Education would have to be employed at the lab.

276,2020/10/23,MGU gears up to conduct exams amid pandemic,"Standard operating procedure likely to be published in November

Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU) has renewed efforts to hold semester exams in the traditional pen-and-paper mode amidst the pandemic crisis.

With the publication of the notification for second semester undergraduate and postgraduate exams, the authorities are hoping that the exams could be conducted as per physical distancing norms and other protocol prescribed by the health authorities.

A standard operating procedure is likely to be published for the conduct of the exams in November. The entry and exit of students will be arranged without overcrowding of candidates. Wherever possible, rush will be minimised by permitting students to leave the campus in a phased manner. The use of masks and sanitisers will be made compulsory for invigilators and students. There will be facilities for washing hands at the entrance and exit points in each college. Students will have to sanitise their hands before entering exam halls. The seating arrangement will ensure the minimum distance prescribed by the government.

The authorities are hopeful that the exams can be conducted in November as regular classes remain suspended in view of the COVID-19 situation. An assessment of the turnout for each exam showed that physical distancing norms could be adhered to as there would be no other students on the campus, except those who appear for the semester exams.

The major challenge is to provide hostel facility to students coming from outside districts. If college managements are not getting permission from the government to reopen hostels, the varsity will propose that they could identify budget hotels and accommodation for such students.

The students may have to confirm the bookings, but the college authorities will be told to provide information on available facilities nearby the college. The varsity authorities said that such facilities would be able to offer discount to students as a majority of the hotels and lodges have little occupancy in view of the pandemic situation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pfeb1f/article32245896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MGU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mgu-gears-up-to-conduct-exams-amid-pandemic/article32923547.ece
277,2020/10/23,Day one of ‘new normal’ evokes mixed response among freshers,"Students worried about connectivity issues affecting online sessions

A meeting with teachers on videoconferencing platforms and introductory sessions on the college and the academic courses aired through YouTube marked the inaugural day of the first semester undergraduate courses at affiliated colleges of Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU) on Thursday.

The ‘new normal’ came as a surprise to both the aspirants and their parents, as they walked in digitally into their colleges amid the pandemic crisis. The managements gave an overall view of the colleges and facilities to the students. Principals pointed out that it was a new experience deviating from the traditional buzz around the first day of the new batch of undergraduate students. “The first day was mainly planned as an induction programme, where representatives of managements and senior faculty members shared their experience and provided insights into the various academic and infrastructural facilities available on the campuses,” they said.

Senior teachers elaborated on grievance redressal forums and anti-harassment committees available at the institutions and requested the students to utilise the ongoing online sessions as an opportunity to get familiarised with a new mode of learning. Teachers from various departments held separate online meetings after the common induction programme with their students. “We had asked parents to join the videoconferencing platforms, so that they would get a fair idea about the courses as well as the challenges and opportunities,” they said.

Meanwhile, the freshers said they enjoyed the first day of online classes even though they missed the excitement of being on the campus. “It may take us a while to get used to the new situation.

The youngsters were concerned about the lack of mobile and Internet connectivity hampering their efforts to get uninterrupted access to online sessions.

278,2020/10/23,Kin of another COVID victim allege negligence by hospital,"Complaint filed with Kalamassery police against medical college hospital staff

The family of Jameela, 53, who died of COVID-19 at the Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, on August 17 has filed a complaint with the Kalamassery police, alleging medical negligence.

Faizal T.A., her son and resident of Kunnunkara village under the Paravur Taluk filed the complaint on Thursday against the doctors and nursing staff who were on duty on August 17 as well as the superintendent of the hospital.

“We had doubts regarding my mother’s death. This got strengthened following revelations of medical negligence by Najma Salim, a junior doctor,” he said in the complaint.

Mr. Faizal alleged that his mother had told her family about the lack of medical care at the hospital.

“She also informed us that she did not get hot water despite requesting the staff. My mother had also asked us to shift her from the hospital,” he said.

The family has demanded a comprehensive inquiry into her death after collecting evidence on the alleged medical negligence.

The Kalamassery police, who had initiated an inquiry into the death of Palluruthy resident C.K. Harris on July 20, recorded the statement of his relative Anwar Hanif on Thursday.

He alleged that the death had occurred owing to medical negligence at the intensive care unit. “We had lodged a complaint before the hospital superintendent soon after his death but failed to receive any response,” he said.

Dr. Najma Salim on Thursday requested all not to portray the institution in bad light. “I had only pointed out lapses in a few cases,” she said.

Meanwhile, protests demanding an inquiry into the alleged medical negligence continued on Thursday. Youth Congress and BJP activists took out a march to the hospital.

The hospital authorities had denied allegations of medical negligence, maintaining that there was a deliberate attempt to tarnish the reputation of the institution, which continued to remain in the forefront of the fight against the pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kin-of-another-covid-victim-allege-negligence-by-hospital/article32923477.ece
279,2020/10/23,"Selective testing for SARS-CoV-2 need of the hour, say experts","‘Dip in testing figures due to data entry glitch’

While a section of doctors and health experts have raised demands for more widespread COVID-19 testing in the State, others suggest that a judicious allocation of resources would be a more prudent strategy.

Health economist Rijo John said the State was doing an average of 1,422 tests per million per day for the past week, which placed it in the seventh position compared to other States. “But with a test positivity rate at a seven-day average of 14%, we should be testing a lot more, otherwise we will miss registering an increasing number of cases,” he said.

From a seven-day average of around 62,000 tests on October 7, absolute testing figures had fallen by around 20% to a seven-day average of 50,431 on Tuesday, he said. While the test positivity rate had been at 16% a few days ago, it had fallen a little recently, since fewer cases are being detected, he added.

Besides, the State has not been releasing figures on positivity based on the type of test done, Mr. John said. “Around 80% of the tests done are antigen tests, and these tests have a lower test positivity rate than RT-PCR tests,” he informed.

“We have tried to increase testing. From the 2,000-3,000 tests we were doing initially, it hit nearly 70,000 recently, which is a 20- to 30-fold increase,” said Dr. Amar Fettle, State nodal officer for public health emergencies. “If we are to increase testing further, more people will have to be diverted to testing. Others will have to be recruited and trained, since the process is a time-consuming and meticulous one, right from collection to package, dispatch, and documentation,” he added.

Testing figures had fallen a little a few days ago, when a new software portal was introduced. Tests were done, but there had been a glitch with entering the data, Dr. Fettle said.

Considering the pandemic’s trajectory in the State which had reached a plateau in the past few days, a marginal increase from an average of around 50,000 tests now to nearly 75,000 tests daily might be beneficial, said Dr. T.S. Anish, Associate Professor of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. “For the time being, a large increase in testing might not be necessary. If test positivity rate increases further to over 20%, maybe tests would have to go up further,” he said.

“We need to see if resources are being used effectively. If tests are increased to one lakh, we need to see what our advantage will be. We might be able to pick up more cases and get a more reasonable estimation of the actual number of people infected in the State. With the current testing figures, if we can detect symptomatic cases, increased testing might reveal cases among asymptomatic people or those already in quarantine, which does not help in controlling the spread of the disease,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/djqwb0/article32923444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-KI-COVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/selective-testing-need-of-the-hour-say-experts/article32923445.ece
280,2020/10/23,"Kochi has 3,404 cases of CRZ violations","Details emerge in affidavit submitted by Chief Secretary before apex court

The State government is awaiting reports on 3,404 cases of reported Coastal Zone Regulation (CRZ) violations in Ernakulam district. Another 301 cases have been compiled by the district committee appointed by the government to track violations.

The picture of CRZ violations in the district emerged in a recent affidavit filed by Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta before the Supreme Court. The affidavit also indicated that there were 152 cases in the district, which belonged to the category of permissible constructions for which prior clearance was not obtained.

Kollam and Alappuzha topped the list of violations with 4,860 and 4,650 cases respectively. The affidavit indicated that the district committees had reported a total of 27,735 cases of violations across the State. The Chief Secretary also indicated that the final list of violations might vary after field verifications and site inspections.

The coastal district committees prepared the draft CRZ violation list with the help of documents available with local bodies. The list was published on the websites of the districts for comments, suggestions, and opinions from the general public. The public appealed to the coastal committees to conduct field verifications before finalising the list of violations against the CRZ notification. Field verifications could not be completed in time owing to the pandemic outbreak, the Chief Secretary submitted.

He also submitted that complaints raised by the public against CRZ violations might be confirmed after field verifications and site inspections with satellite imageries and field collection data using advanced geo-informatics tools such as Differential Global Positioning System and Electronic Total Station. Field verifications are being planned to be carried out by officials of local bodies, Revenue, and town planing and technical experts, the affidavit said.

Incidentally, the State-wide crackdown on CRZ violations got a momentum after the demolition of the four apartment complexes at Maradu, which had come up on the banks of the Vembanad Lake in violation of rules. While ordering the demolition of the structures, the Supreme Court had also asked the State government to come up with a list of violations in the State.

In his affidavit, the Chief Secretary sought an additional eight months for completion of identification of violations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/wb2eqh/article32923325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-KI-KAPICO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kochi-has-3404-cases-of-crz-violations/article32923326.ece
281,2020/10/23,Stakeholders set the ball rolling for water transport system,"Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has initiated stakeholder meetings for the Integrated Urban Regeneration and Water Transport System (IURWTS) project. Discussions in this regard were held with Better Kochi Response Group (BKRG), an NGO, here on Thursday.

The meeting discussed the project in detail, including the support needed for waste management. KMRL presented the technical aspects and challenges of the IURWTS project. BKRG, led by its president S. Gopakumar, gave inputs on the best engineering practices in the field of wastewater engineering and canal rejuvenation philosophies.

KMRL managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma sought the cooperation of all stakeholders, including professional organisations, for the successful implementation of the project. KMRL intends to seek views from the public, people’s representatives, government bodies, NGOs, and businessmen for the execution of the project. The pandemic situation is definitely challenging, especially so since personal meetings to discuss the project are impractical, including for the planning stage, he said.

282,2020/10/23,AuSa to bring much needed relief to auto drivers,"Booking app to ensure fixed fare for auto ride as in online taxi services

There is light at the end of the tunnel for autorickshaw drivers in the Greater Kochi area, amid a pall of gloom caused by a steep fall in demand for public transport, thanks to the impending launch of AuSa, an autorickshaw-ride-booking app.

It will be more than a ride-booking app and will be launched this year itself. The app will change the face of autorickshaw operations in the region. The public image of drivers too will improve, since the fare will be fixed, just like for online taxi cars. Over the years, a section of drivers who fleeced passengers and often refused to operate trips had brought a bad name for the sector, said Binu Varghese, secretary, Autorickshaw Drivers Union (AITUC).

“Already, the foray of e-autos in the city hub has been well accepted by passengers, since the fare is ₹10 for 2 km. The app will further bring in accountability while offering a safer ride for commuters. It will be a win-win for passengers and drivers who now have to wait for long at stands to get passengers. Kochi Metro Rail Limited [KMRL] provided the initial support for the venture, while personnel of Technovia Info Solutions readied the platform for us. Promotional videos of the venture will shortly be launched,” he added.

The Ernakulam Jilla Autorickshaw Drivers Cooperative Society, a conclave of half-a-dozen autorickshaw driver unions, which have a total membership of 25,000, bore the expenses of the initiative, while drivers who avail the app will have to bear a nominal expense. The revenue model is being finalised, including the possibility of garnering alternative revenue, sources said.

The mobile application will shortly be available in Google Playstore for downloading. A few hundred drivers have already been trained in the app, using which autos will initially operate in and around the 25-km Kochi metro route from Aluva to Pettah. The app will be extended to other areas once passengers and drivers become familiar with it. In the long run, it could also be used to enable ferrying of merchandise from shops to houses in the vicinity, thus enabling door delivery of provisions and other household goods, they added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/odagcq/article32923282.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201022-WA0103,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ausa-to-bring-much-needed-relief-to-auto-drivers/article32923283.ece

285,2020/10/23,"Reports on Pope endorsing same-sex union baseless, says Kerala Catholic body","Church denies change in policy on same-sex marriages.

In the wake of reports suggesting that Pope Francis has welcomed same-sex civil unions, the Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council has issued a statement affirming that there is no change in the Church’s stance on family life or same-sex love.

“News reports that said Pope Francis has justified same-sex marriage in a documentary ‘Francesco’ directed by Evgeny Afineevsky, are misleading and baseless,” the Catholic body said in a release here on Thursday.

“The Church doesn’t announce its doctrines on marriage and family life through documentaries. Pope Francis has said even before that people in the LGBT state are children of God and deserve all care, consideration and love. A similar stance was taken by the Church in the doctrine on sexual morality issued in 1975. The Church is of the view that homosexual tendencies and homosexual acts should be viewed separately,” the statement said.

The Catholic Church doesn’t see the living together of same-sex lovers as marriage. But this has been recognised by some countries as a civil union. The Church is seriously considering adding those in such relations to the flock. This was the official stance pronounced by the Pope and there hasn’t been any change in this, the statement quotes KCBC media commission chairman Bishop Joseph Pamplany as saying.

286,2020/10/23,75 exotic birds seized along Bangladesh border,"They were transported to Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata

As many as 75 exotic birds were seized along the international border while being smuggled to Bangladesh over the past two days.

While the BSF on Tuesday seized 54 birds near its outpost at Tentulberia in the North 24 Parganas district, it seized 21 cuckatoos from Jhowdanga in the same district on Wednesday night.

Officials of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau said the birds were alive, and had been transported to the Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata.

The birds seized on Tuesday were from six rare varieties of lorikeets found in Australia and South East Asia. They were 11 chattering lorikeets, 13 red and blue lorikeets, eight black-capped lorikeets, eight black lorikeets, six brown lorikeets, and eight violet-necked lorikeets. The BSF said the birds were crammed in two iron cages.

Lorikeets are medium-sized brightly coloured parrots that live in large flocks.

According to experts, the birds are smuggled for being kept as pets. While illegal wildlife trade has emerged as a form of organised trans-national crime, there have also been seizures of highly threatened species like a lion cub and three white-headed langurs near Kolkata.

288,2020/10/23,Varana’s Milan debut,"From Bengaluru to Mayfair and now to Milan, the luxury brand is growing — with wholesale opportunities, e-commerce, and a new line of craft-infused cotton T-shirts

Varana, the sustainable luxury Indian fashion brand that’s garnering a cult following internationally, recently introduced e-commerce and debuted its collection to the wholesale trade in Italy. It is the next step — after the Bengaluru-based company opened a four-storey flagship store in London’s Mayfair in 2017 — in their goal to make a big impact abroad. Its pared down silhouettes, quality fabrics and handwork detailing have won favour with buyers, including the likes of celebrated boutiques Blu (Capri), Sam Tessabit (Como), and Popp & Kretschmer (Vienna). Antonio Arcucci, the owner of Blu, says he likes the brand “both for the quality of the garments and its clean, refined look”.

Varana had plans to show in New York, London, and Paris, now cancelled because of the pandemic. Still, “it was a good start because in Italy people know and understand fashion and high quality, and we were well received,” says Sujata Keshavan, Varana’s co-founder and creative director, via telephone. Saskia Terzani, who consults on business strategy (she was instrumental in taking the Victoria Beckham brand global) and oversaw the brand’s Milan debut at the chic fashion venue Hotel Diana, tells me that buyers flipped dresses from underneath to look at the stitch inside. “Their hands touched the fabric; it is old school, but in Italy there is a real appreciation for fabric,” she says. The brand is also set to meet with Harrods and Selfridges in London. Pre-Covid, Varana was carried at Chicago’s celebrated Ikram boutique, and at high-end hotels in Europe such as Gstaad Palace in Gstaad, Beau Rivage in Lausanne, and the Crillon in Paris.

A quiet joy

Much as pioneering Japanese designers such as Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake did in the 1980s — bringing their clothes, and consequently their culture, to the attention of the West — Varana’s bold ambition is to showcase the finest Indian craft techniques in contemporary styles. “We don’t have many fashion brands in international markets because a lot of luxury Indian wear is traditional and focused on the local market,” says Keshavan. “India is not a famous destination for luxury although we do a lot of beautiful work for other western brands [think Versace, Gucci, Prada].” She and fellow co-founder Ravi Prasad set out to rectify that, marrying highly-skilled indigenous handwork with functional, refined designs. Keshavan describes this design philosophy as a ‘quiet joy’, confident in its simplicity yet imbued with fine details of the highest quality. Citing the example of Hermès, The Row and Brunello Cuccinelli for their prized tailoring and fabrics, the founding duo hope to propel Varana into that league.

With silk shirts retailing for ₹40,000, cashmere trousers for ₹69,000, and a silk organza trench for ₹1,64,339, Varana’s price points reflect its high-end positioning. Prasad, who headed The Himalaya Drug Company for years, says, via Zoom, that Varana is “intentionally positioned at a price level that the quality commands. When we sold in Milan, I asked Saskia if any of the buyers asked about it and she said that, uniformly, they thought the prices were appropriate.” But, recognising that entry-level price points could help build business, Varana also recently launched a line of organic, craft-infused cotton T-shirts, priced at ₹11,908. For those not in London, the company absorbs shipping and duty costs from website sales to ensure pricing parity worldwide.

“The fabrics are absolutely beautiful and the designs are unique,” says Maribelle Beckmann, who chanced upon Varana when it opened in London. She has been shopping there ever since. Beckmann, a senior executive at Commerzbank, wrote over email that she “felt the product quality was extremely high and the fabrics were gorgeous to touch. Also, compared to the more well-known designer brands [Italian and French], the price point was extremely attractive and exceptional value”.

Global inputs

Today Varana has 75 employees, with two manufacturing units in Bengaluru, and works with eight to 10 craft clusters around India — including West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Ladakh. But five years ago, it was a different scenario.

Keshavan and Prasad both come from a non-fashion background. “We had no clue as to how the business of fashion works,” says Prasad, with a laugh. They knew they had to find people with international expertise. They hired Stefano Arienti, an Italian with years of experience at Prada and Louis Vuitton, to set up the back-end operations in Bengaluru. Arienti’s attention to detail included adjusting the tension in each hand operated tailoring machine so that running stitches turned out accurately. It paid off. Prasad says that while Varana’s units take far longer to produce a garment compared to other manufacturers, their rejection rate is only 0.1%.

Staying conscious Varana sees itself as a post-Covid brand. “The customer is looking for a brand that is good for you, the planet, the artisan,” Prasad says, while Keshavan adds that the use of natural fibers and handloom ensures a low carbon footprint (these fabrics use less water). “The provenance of a product, fair wages — people care about this now,” she says. Although currently producing in small batches, if e-commerce and wholesale take off, that will change. As Keshavan says, “What I really want is to have a wider presence because we are doing this to keep our crafts going.”

They also hired Mark Forestier, former managing director of British luxury label Joseph, as CEO (he later left for Issey Miyake). Varana’s digital push is being spearheaded by Terilyn Novak, who spent two decades at Gucci building the brand’s e-commerce platform. Textile designers from India complement European fashion designers and pattern cutters, and a Japanese heads knitwear.

As far as plans for India go, the company would love to retail here but says the current offering needs to be tweaked for local customers. For a start, the weather conditions are different to those of the West. Plus, Indian consumers want visible value for money, and it remains to be seen if Varana’s lack of embellishments on simple silhouettes at a high price point find enough followers here. The company may do a few trunk shows to test the market before taking the plunge.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/cy5kkl/article32929511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Amara-Coat-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/varanas-milan-debut/article32929514.ece
289,2020/10/23,Movie night: at FDCI’s India Fashion Week,"The first digital RTW fashion shows told a collective story of a country struggling with the Covid pandemic. Here is the script

Just like artists, fashion designers are bad liars. They can drape you in luxurious silks and velvets, make flowers grow from mere fabric, and sculpt statues with corsets and capes, but they cannot hide their hearts. Their work is, and must always be, seen in context of the time and place in which it is created.

So how did the first digital RTW fashion week in India — the Lotus Make-up India Fashion Week (LMIFW) organised by the FDCI — fare on this scale? Creatively, it passed with flying colours, even while painting a bleak vision. The collections, reader, are the first ones designed and produced within the timeline of the global Covid-19 pandemic. This is a sobering first. And they came together to tell a story, which I will do my best to tell you.

The opening show

In the beginning, there was the Pandemic. And discarded oxygen cylinders as tall as people were seen everywhere. Models in Rajesh Pratap Singh (61.9K views) walked among them in hospital-white smocks and shirt-dresses, raised necklines covering half their faces. Multicoloured patchworks became block-printed and foiled tunics, as if some enterprising, post-apocalyptic tailor had taken beautiful scraps from the artisans of Jaipur to preserve the art. The young label Bloni (30.6K views) proposed an Industrial style for going out in small groups. Slick, easy separates with reflective finishes and the glamour of oversized sequins showed the way the new generation of influencers would dress to impress.

The mood in Delhi though, according to Shantanu and Nikhil Mehra’s collection for S&N (58.7K views), had changed entirely. In the past, India had been a Democracy. But in 2034, the ‘High Chancellor’, ‘Cabinet Leaders’, and the ‘Head of the Imperial Secret Service’ ruled with an iron fist — dressed in martial uniforms, a design discipline that our former colonisers, the British, once prided themselves over. Asymmetric drapes, fluid capes, camp sunglasses, and military caps, all festooned with make-believe badges, braids, and epaulettes: these became the modern military regalia for those who never did enlist. And an AI took over the running of the country.

Dangerous times

Meanwhile, out on the streets, turf wars looked like a crossover between Namrata Joshipura’s modern Matrix (48.7K views) and Siddhartha Tytler’s Mad Max: Fury Road (38.6K views). The standoff: Joshipura’s slick, sequined, tiger-striped jackets and feather-embellished capes, chain-mail like shifts and pearl-encrusted noise-cancelling headphones, against Tytler’s hood rats in reflective jacquard suits and neon-quilted bombers, designed to warn off others in the dark of night. At Rohit Gandhi + Rahul Khanna (86.9K views), the overlords and ladies gathered in underground clubs to toast their success and survival in high Black Tie: embellished tuxedos and metal-sequined gowns à la Underworld.

Number crunching Meanwhile on Instagram handles, Shivan & Narresh’s show seems to have been the highest watched digital runway collection with 214K views

The rich, though, seemed unaffected. Draping themselves in digital prints of Renaissance masterpieces from Shivan & Narresh (35K views), and dressed in tiered gowns from Nidhi Yasha (23.7K views), they escaped — mentally, physically, and because they could — to seaside locations. This follows a very real phenomenon seen in recent months, of people from the twin capitals escaping to Goa. Delhi may be the political power center and Mumbai the business core, but this quaint southwestern Union Territory has become the Pandemic Capital of India. Those who live here dress in bright colours, riotous prints, and opulent fabrics, reminding themselves that there is something good in the world.

Still, the days continue to dawn, and everyone needs a light touch. So a few remained to provide hope. Like Varun Bahl (44K views), with his delicate dedication to flowers. Made with fabric and sprinkled judiciously onto silken slip dresses and kimono-inspired wraps, these miniature artistic blossoms evoked nostalgia for a generation that actually remembered better times. At Gauri & Nainika (41K views), flowers became prints, and grew into oversized blooms covering the entire body in petals of silk and organza and taffeta.

Solidarity train

Like the end of any post-apocalyptic movie, the global south, represented by Africa, also had its moment this season. Ashish Soni, who spent his growing-up years in Zambia’s Kitwe province, took on this task. Zambia may be one of Africa’s safest nations today, but when Soni was there, he remembers living behind steel reinforced doors, with guard dogs on duty. Six of them.

Location check While S&N was shot at The Lodhi, New Delhi, some designers filmed at the FDCI studio in Okhla, and Shivan & Narresh took the beach set to a quarry lake amid the Aravallis

As his digital show began (32.8K views), a note clarified that it was not a human rights campaign, but a personal pledge towards the inclusion Black people deserve in the fashion community. Did what followed reflect Soni’s intentions? With a cast of exclusively Black models walking to voice recordings of speeches by Black leaders and victims, it seemed to, at least at that level. But the clothes — slick tonal jacquard jackets, deconstructed textures on bombers, layered skirts worn over sneakers and leggings — seemed somewhat accidental to the narrative.

290,2020/10/23,A town that no longer needs a dump,"Efforts on to turn Puthiyappa dumping yard in Vadakara into a green park

Vadakara Municipality has been the talk of the town for a few years now for its achievements in sanitation and hygiene. Being the first urban local body in the State to bag the Hygiene Status, the municipality has set a model in different areas. The newest is the conversion of a rubbish dump into a green park.

The town’s dumping yard at Puthiyappa has a history of at least half a century. Just three decades ago, it was a trenching ground where dead bodies and even faeces used to be buried. Later, a compound wall was constructed around the one-acre plot, and it became a place to dump all kinds of urban waste.

The authorities had to face protests from local people over maintaining it as a dumping yard, as the smell emanating from the yard and liquid waste were posing a threat to their well-being. A petition at the Kerala High Court prompted the municipality to take action, and it attempted to produce manure from waste, which, however, failed.

Meanwhile, Vadakara became so efficient in waste management that it no longer required a dumping yard. “We have shown the State that if waste is segregated and recycled in the right manner, there is nothing to dump,” said Manalil Mohan, an environmentalist, who has been coordinating sanitation efforts of the municipality for a few years now.

Clearing refuse

The present municipal council began efforts to get rid of the dumping yard by clearing some of the waste from the yard and capping the surface using coir geotextile.

The Puthiyappa trenching ground in Vatakara before the waste was cleared.

However, around 30,000 cubic-metre waste is yet to be removed from the site. Biomining is the technology adopted at the site, in which waste is passed through a sieve to sort. In addition, efforts are being made to convert the area into a green park. Vadakara’s famed Hariyali Harithakarma Sena has been entrusted with the task.For over a month, members of the Sena under the leadership of Vijila M.K., Beena.T.K., and Sathi.T.T. have been undertaking plantain and vegetable cultivation in the land. The Green Technology Centre at Vadakara, another first in the State, is providing technical assistance.

“In the current pace, it will take us at least a couple of years to convert the yard into a green park. It will be another first in the State,” Mr. Mohan said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/lb8nht/article32922697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201019-WA0007,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/a-town-that-no-longer-needs-a-dump/article32922652.ece
291,2020/10/23,Local body struggles to handle plastic waste,"Periodic inspections and follow-up procedures hit due to COVID-19 curbs

Even as the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation is making efforts to maintain and improve its Hygiene Status, the civic body is falling short when it comes to plastic waste management.

Corporation health standing committee chairman K.V. Baburaj said despite the best efforts and good results the health wing had achieved in the earlier days of plastic ban this year, it was forced to hold back and concentrate on immediate situation owing to the pandemic.

“We had made headway in controlling the flow of single-use plastic before the pandemic outbreak. But now, we are not in a position to carry out periodic inspections and follow-up procedures owing to severe staff shortage and COVID-19 restrictions,” Mr. Baburaj said.

Piles of plastic waste, mainly disposable utensils and carry bags, can be found in various parts of the city, especially along the NH Bypass. However, Mr. Baburaj said travellers were responsible for waste piling up along the bypass.

“We have a good system of collection and segregation of waste in the city. Despite initial glitches owing the pandemic, our Harithakarma Sena is now active. Waste found along the bypass is not generated by the city but disposed of by travellers,” he said.

Meanwhile, the civic body is trying to improve its score for the Hygiene Status with more activities.

“We had 85% marks. But our effort is to make it 100%,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/lrqj20/article32922629.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23tvkzbypass,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/local-body-struggles-to-handle-plastic-waste/article32922630.ece
292,2020/10/23,Efforts on to showcase Kozhikode’s heritage and history,"Construction of structures that will highlight the city’s medieval past as well as buildings in memory of Vaikom Mohammed Basheer are in the pipeline.

Some efforts are now being made to unearth Kozhikode’s history and showcase it for posterity. They include construction of structures that will highlight the city’s medieval past as well as buildings in memory of arguably its most famous resident Vaikom Mohammed Basheer, who made Beypore his home after marriage.

M. Beena, secretary, District Tourism Promotion Council, said on Thursday that the funds released by the Tourism Department and the MLA were being utilised for the ongoing works at Tali and Kuttichira. “There were frequent disruptions owing to the pandemic situation. But a large part of the works is over and it will be finished as early as possible,” she added.

Tali Temple and its surroundings were once the nucleus of the erstwhile Zamorin royalty. Some of the royal palaces were believed to be situated around the temple, which also hosted Revathi Pattathanam, a debate between Vedic scholars. The Tourism Department is now renovating the temple pond and surrounding areas. Walls will be erected on the eastern walk way and carvings depicting the history of the royalty would find a place there. There would be small notes on the historical developments adjacent to it. The buildings surrounding the pond and the stairs would be renovated. A representational statue of the Zamorin too is expected to come up near the banyan tree outside the temple. A museum detailing the evolution of the city is also on the cards.

Kuttichira, another unique part of the city, which house large matrilineal Muslim ancestral homes and two ancient mosques, the Mishkal Mosque and the Muchundi Mosque, too would see renovation works. The area surrounding the pond there too would be beautified and new structures are expected to come up. Meanwhile, excavation works are going on at the now forlorn fort built by Tipu Sultan, the once mighty ruler of Mysore, at Feroke. Archaeologists have reportedly unearthed copper coins, coin pellet mould, and parts of British and Chinese crockery there. The works were taken up following a court order.

Twenty six long years after he passed away, Basheer, who once famously described himself as the ‘Sultan of Beypore’ is expected to get a memorial too. Kozhikode corporation recently held a meeting to discuss the issue and decided to demolish an unused community hall for building the structure. Additional land would be utilised too. Earlier, the government had allocated Rs. 50 lakh for a memorial for Basheer, but the funds could not be used and it was taken back. A cultural centre, museum, research centre, open theatre and miniatures on Basheer’s characters are expected to come up there.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/pkf9fz/article32922543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22KI-BASHEER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/efforts-on-to-showcase-kozhikodes-heritage-and-history-with-tali-pic-by-ragesh-and-basheer-pic-158292014/article32922544.ece

295,2020/10/23,COVID-19 leads to change in evaluation process in schools,"Students asked to complete multiple choice questions sent online by the schools

With the closure of schools owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, online classes are being conducted by private schools for the past five months and now classes are being conducted for the second term as well.

The current set-up has not only changed the teaching methodology, but has changed the evaluation process as well. Most of the private schools did not conduct three-hour-long quarterly examinations before commencement of the second term, but opted for unit tests for a shorter duration to assess students.

D. Ravikumar, vice-president of Tamil Nadu Nursery Primary Matriculation Higher Secondary CBSE Schools Association, said most private schools conducted online examinations to assess students. “It was optional for students to take up the exams as the government had directed that students must not be compelled to take tests or attend online classes,” he said.

Students were asked to complete multiple choice questions in the online sheets sent by the schools. “Students of Classes 10, 11 and 12 were asked to have their cameras switched on while writing long answers. These students had to scan their answer sheets and had to either mail it or WhatsApp the answer sheets to their schools,” he added.

Guidelines released by the State government for online classes said that while assessments could be carried out during the period, they should not be made mandatory or counted for final scores.

Sangeetha, a parent of a Class 5 student, said closely watching the computer screen while writing the exam had resulted in eye strain for her daughter.

Indira Pandiarajan, a member of Global Nursery and Primary Schools Association, said many private schools allowed students to take up the online exams only if they had paid the tuition fee.

Mr. Ravikumar said schools were constantly keeping tests for students of Classes 10 and 12, as they fear that these students will have to take up board examinations next year.

Several teachers reiterated the need to make an early announcement on the reduced syllabus, said K.Saravanan, Principal of Dr. T. Thirugnanam Primary School.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/2wipy1/article32932281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MACITY-ONLINECLASSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/covid-19-leads-to-change-in-evaluation-process-in-schools/article32931920.ece

299,2020/10/23,No entry for outsiders at Pasumpon for Thevar Jayanthi: SP,"Gold ‘kavacham’ for Thevar statue placed at samadhi

In view of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic and the curfew in force under Cr PC Section 144, it has been decided not to permit outsiders, i.e. people from other districts/States to enter Pasumpon village between October 28 and 30, to participate in the Muthuramalinga Thevar Jayanthi, said Superintendent of Police E.

303,2020/10/23,Govt. releases additional ₹14 cr. for Pachchanady relief works,"Earlier, the government had released ₹8 crore for the purpose, say MLAs

The State government has released an additional ₹ 14 crore for relief works related to solid waste slip at a landfill site of the Mangaluru City Corporation at Pachchanady in August last year, according to Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath and Mangaluru City North MLA Y. Bharat Shetty.

Earlier, the government had released ₹ 8 crore for the relief works, they said in a statement. With this, the government has released ₹ 22 crore, in all, sought for by the district administration for relief works.

The garbage slip in the rainy season had affected 35 families besides bringing down several coconut and arecanut palms. The waste slip covered 13.5 acres of private land, including farm land. A revenue official in the corporation said that of the ₹ 8 crore released earlier, half of the amount has been reserved for building a retaining wall in the area. Of the balance ₹ 4 crore reserved for providing compensation to the affected families, ₹ 2.52 crore has been given to 32 families having “pahani” towards damage caused to their farm land.

The official said that a meeting of the affected families has been called next month to decide on the other forms of compensation to be given to them and other relief measures to be taken up in the affected area.

Meanwhile, the civic body has proposed to the government bio-mining of solid waste dumped over the years in the site to reclaim the land for further use by recovering non-biodegradable material in the same site to send it for recycling.

According to the corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar, bio-mining is estimated to cost ₹ 17 crore.

An environment engineer of the civic body said that the dumped solid waste spread over 25 acres, including the 13.5 acres of private land, in Pachchanady is estimated to be six lakh tonnes. Once bio-mining is taken up, it is expected to come down to 2.4 lakh tonnes as the refuse derived fuel (RDF) material (such as plastic recovered) in the site are estimated at 40 %.

The ₹ 17-crore cost estimated excludes the transportation of the recovered material in bales. Bales of plastic recovered will have to be transported to cement industries which are at least 700 km away from Mangaluru. It required an additional fund, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/ru0ndl/article32922910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23MNGARBAGEDUMPSLIP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/govt-releases-additional-14-cr-for-pachchanady-relief-works/article32922911.ece

Walmart’s Flipkart is set to acquire a 7.8% stake in Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd. (ABFRL) for ₹1,500 crore, intensifying the battle in fashion e-commerce with Amazon.com and Reliance Industries’ retail arm.

The ABFRL board had approved a proposal to raise ₹1,500 crore through a preferential issue to the Flipkart Group, the fashion apparel company said in a filing on Friday. The equity capital will be raised at ₹205 per share.

The promoter group of ABFRL would hold about 55.13% upon completion of the issuance, the firm said.

309,2020/10/23,No September green shoots for oil and gas production,"Natural gas, petroleum products witness sharpest decline

The impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and the consequent lower demand, continued to dampen India’s oil and gas production in September, with output shrinking sharply compared with a year earlier, as per official data released on Friday.

The sharpest year-on-year contraction was recorded in natural gas production (-10.7%), followed by petroleum products (-9.49%) and processed crude oil (-8.8%). Crude oil output slid 6.05%.

Between April and September, processed crude oil and petroleum products saw the sharpest decline from a year earlier — 20.3% and 16.3%, respectively.

Shy of targets

All four product categories are significantly short of their production targets for the year. ONGC cited the shutdown of its Hazira plant following a fire in late September and the related closure of its western offshore gas wells apart from ‘COVID-19 implications’ delaying work on new sub-sea wells as reasons for a 6.84% drop in natural gas output. OIL, which posted a 13.4% fall in September, partly blamed low demand for gas from major customers.

Private players such as Reliance Industries as well as joint ventures operating under the production-sharing contract regime, also cited COVID-19 as a reason for the 26.7% drop in September’s natural gas output. A couple of players blamed ‘further reduced gas offtake’ from power plant customers and delay in a new plant’s commissioning due to COVID-19.

RIL informed the government that ‘project progress’ of its D-34 offshore gas field in the Krishna Godavari basin ‘was on track till the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and despite the pandemic constraints/lockdown, best efforts were being made to overcome the situation.’ The field was expected to begin production by June 2020, which has since been pushed to the second half of this year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ihb6vf/article32932643.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THBUONGC,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/no-september-green-shoots-for-oil-and-gas-production/article32932644.ece
310,2020/10/23,Pandemic to delay EV penetration in India says Ind-Ra,"Low affordability and the government’s priorities on reviving the otherwise suffering auto industry could shift the focus away from EVs in the interim

COVID-19 pandemic would delay the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the Indian automobile industry, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said in a report.

Low affordability and the government’s priorities on reviving the otherwise suffering auto industry could shift the focus away from EVs in the interim, it said.

“Passenger vehicles (PVs) would face a double whammy as consumers would be wary to buy a costlier EV than an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle while original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) would refrain from incurring high capex,” the report added.

Stating that growth in buses may take a back seat as orders for city buses are largely from state transport undertakings, and state governments are already grappling with a falling GDP, it said two wheelers (2W), especially scooters, could see an upside due to the lower pricing delta between an EV and ICE and several models available to consumers.

“Though the EV penetration is likely to be faster in scooters, buses and three wheelers (3W) in the medium term (defined as three to five years), PVs may take longer,” it said.

Ind-Ra said the underlying challenges in the adoption of EVs such as higher battery cost and reliance on imports would prevail in the medium term, and robust government policies would remain key for the development of EVs in the country.

It said reduced affordability and lower economic activities due to the pandemic could result in the automobile industry recording a decline in sales of over 20% year-on-year for the second consecutive year in FY21.

“This is likely to impact the sales of EVs which are costlier than an ICE vehicle. 2Ws have benefitted from rural demand and shift to personal mobility, and the segment could be the least impacted with regard to electrification due to better pricing and model choices,” it said.

However, 3W and buses, which have seen higher electrification in 2019, are among the most affected segments in FY21 and hence could see a delay in electrification, it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/9awpn8/article32929220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EV,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/pandemic-to-delay-ev-penetration-in-india-says-ind-ra/article32929221.ece

Vaccine maker Bharat Biotech plans to conduct Phase III clinical trial for COVID-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin from November.

The company, which is developing the vaccine in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), intends to conduct the trial on 26,000 volunteers across 25 cities in the country, sources said.

This move follows the company getting Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approval to conduct the Phase III clinical trial for Covaxin.

At its meeting on October 20 a Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the DCGI, giving the approval, said “after detailed deliberation and based on available evidences, the Committee [has] recommended for grant of permission to conduct [of] Phase III clinical trial,” subject to certain conditions.

The company had submitted to the SEC data from the Phase I and II trials along with animal challenge data in two species, including NHP, on the inactivated coronavirus vaccine (BBV152) along with the proposal to conduct event driven Phase III clinical trial to assess the efficacy of the vaccine.

Earlier, on October 5, when the company presented Phase III clinical trial protocol, the SEC took note of the interim data of Phase I and II clinical trial that were also submitted. “After detailed deliberation the Committee opined that the design of the Phase III study is in principle satisfactory except for clarification on definition of asymptomatic,” it had then said.

The study should be initiated with appropriate dose identified from the Phase II safety and immunogenicity data. Accordingly, the firm should submit safety and immunogenicity data from Phase II trial for consideration,” the Committee had said.

Besides Covaxin, for which the SARS-CoV-2 strain was isolated in ICMR- National Institute of Virology, Pune and transferred to Bharat Biotech, other Covid-19 vaccine candidates whose clinical trials are underway in the country include those by Serum Institute of India.

319,2020/10/23,"At 75, the UN needs a rebirth","There must be a global push against the rules that have privileged rule of the few over the many

October 24 marks the diamond jubilee of the United Nations. But far from joyous celebration, it is an occasion to sombrely reflect on why the UN is stagnating at 75 and how it can regain its lost lustre.

Although much has changed in the international system since 1945, the world body continues to see a tussle between ‘principle’ and ‘power’. On the one hand, the UN represents hopes of a peaceful and just world order through multilateral cooperation, abidance by international law, and uplift of the downtrodden. On the other, the institution has been designed to privilege the most powerful states of the post-World War II dispensation by granting them commanding heights over international politics via the undemocratic instruments of veto power and permanent seats in the Security Council (UNSC).

Arguably, if the great powers of that period were not accommodated with VIP status, we may have seen a repeat of the ill-fated League of Nations. Keeping all the major powers inside the tent and reasonably happy through joint control over the UNSC was intended to be a pragmatic step to avoid another world war. Presumably, the collective command model of big powers built into the UNSC is one of the reasons why there has been no third world war.

A model that didn’t work

But this model has also caused havoc. Almost immediately after the UN’s creation, it was pushed to the verge of irrelevance by the Cold War, which left the UN little room to implement noble visions of peace, development and human rights. It was only in the uncontested post-Cold War political milieu, when the liberal sole superpower, the U.S., strode like a colossus, that the UN could spring back to life and embark on a plethora of peacekeeping missions, nation-building interventions and promotion of universal human rights. In the U.S.-led ‘new world order’ of the 1990s, it appeared as if the problem of ‘power’ cutting out ‘principle’ had been resolved under the benign hegemony of a Washington that would be the flag-bearer of UN values.

However, that golden age of the UN was too deceptive to last. We are now past the unipolar moment and the ghosts of the Cold War are returning in complex multi-sided avatars. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has labelled the present peaking of geopolitical tensions as a “great fracture”. The phrase ‘new Cold War’ is in vogue to depict the clash between China and the U.S. Tensions involving other players like Russia, Turkey, Iran and Israel in West Asia, as well as between China and its neighbours in Asia, are at an all-time high.

The recrudescence of the worst habits of competitive vetoing by P-5 countries has prevented the UNSC from fulfilling its collective security mandate. So dangerous are the divisions and their spillover effects that Mr. Guterres has lamented that “we have essentially failed” to cooperate against the immediate global threat of the pandemic. He has also rekindled the old maxim, “The UN is only as strong as its members’ commitment to its ideals.”

Obstacles to reforms

But apart from rivalries of member states, there is a larger underlying problem. At the core of the paralysis of the UN is the phenomenon of P-5 countries (China, France, Russia, the U.K., and the U.S.) blocking reforms. Outmoded procedures based on the discriminatory original sin of superior prerogatives to P-5 countries have to be discarded. Why should expansion of the UNSC require consensus of the P-5? In the 21st century, why should there be veto power in anyone’s hands? If a simple majority voting method could replace the P-5 consensus method, the obstacles to UNSC reforms would reduce.

Editorial | A new world order: On UN reforms

On the 75th anniversary of the UN, there must be a global push against ossifying ‘rules’ which have privileged ‘rule’ of the few over the many. That is the only way to restore some balance between ‘power’ and ‘principle’ and ensure a renaissance of the UN.

320,2020/10/23,Reading in the time of a contagion,"COVID-19 only added to the publishing world’s other pressing anxieties.

One of the most awaited moments for those handling book review pages in newspapers and magazines is the annual catalogues of various publishers. They are elegantly designed, with special attention to fonts, and announce the titles that will highlight the upcoming year. For 2020, on offer were books by Thomas Piketty, Pankaj Mishra, Shashi Tharoor, Perumal Murugan, Romila Thapar, Ira Mukhoty, the prolific Ruskin Bond, and a host of volumes on the U.S. in an election year. There were biographies of an old emperor (Akbar), a shrewd politician (Muhammad Ali Jinnah), India’s first woman doctor (Anandibai Joshi) and a river (Brahmaputra).

But with China reporting a cluster of pneumonia cases late in 2019, the new year began ominously. By March, when a stringent lockdown was announced in India to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, life as we knew it was changing forever. With people falling sick, others forced indoors and the economy in a tailspin, it was inevitable that publishing, like every other cog in the wheel, would have to brace for hard times.

Uncertainty ruled the next three months. As schedules began to go awry for publishers, with printing presses shut, a shortage of hands and commissioning issues, the worry was that there would not be easy access to books for reading and review. With books not listed in the “essential” category, distribution was hit hard. Big wine and cheese launches became a thing of the past and were replaced by livestreams and webinars. The digital connect ensured the flow of material as PDFs, that included several books on the dreaded virus, but reviewers complained of weary eyes and said they missed the rustle of pages.

For the publishing world, however, there are other more pressing anxieties. The financial impact for an industry already struggling for various reasons will be terrible. The independent bookstore round the corner is facing closure, even as the might of Amazon becomes stronger. Struggling bookstores are already offering discounts way beyond their means, and home delivery.

Then there are other challenges, from the overriding trend of a gradual decline in reading for pleasure, and the shift to digital. India may be a population of 1.6 billion, but how many have access to the digital world for reading? COVID-19 laid bare the glaring inequities. The sale of e-books may have risen during the lockdown but it comprises a small portion of the publishing world in India and won’t make up for losses.

Ask anyone in the publishing industry what Indians prefer reading, and there’s no clear answer. At the moment, books on health, economy, politics, religion, sport, romance and thrillers are “doing well”, though no one likes to define what it means in terms of sales. But the genres provide a clue to a reader’s mind. Why else would there be a renewed wish to read George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984? Or all the sci-fi novels on contagion? Writers around the world are already keeping journals of the 2020 virus. In a recent literary anthology, Mario Vargas Llosa said when we cannot understand what is happening around us, as a society we turn to books to see if they offer any answers.

321,2020/10/23,Has India passed the COVID-19 peak?,"We cannot emphatically say that it has, as the virus has not spread uniformly across the country

Since mid-September, the number of daily new COVID-19 cases recorded has been reducing from the peak of 90,000-odd cases. A few days ago, the COVID-19 India National Supermodel Committee, constituted by the Department of Science and Technology, based on mathematical modelling studies, concluded that India had passed the COVID-19 peak in September. It also found that there will be fewer than 50,000 active cases from December and if proper safety protocols continue to be followed, the pandemic can be “controlled by early next year” with “minimal” active symptomatic infections by end-February. In a conversation moderated by R. Prasad, Gautam Menon (a Professor of Physics and Biology at Ashoka University and co-author of COVID-19 modelling studies) and Giridhara R. Babu (a Professor of Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru, and a member of the Karnataka COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee) discuss whether India has gone past the peak. Edited excerpts:

The number of daily new cases recorded has been reducing from the peak of about 90,000 cases since mid-September even as the number of tests done each day remain at about 10,00,000. Does this suggest that the pandemic has peaked in India?

Gautam Menon: I think what it suggests is that in the major cities, and in some districts adjacent to those cities that already have sufficient numbers of people infected, the number of new infections is going down, which is to be expected. I don’t think one can say that a bigger or an equivalent peak is not in store for us, because my feeling is that the virus has not been spreading uniformly in India. There are many districts where the number of cases remains small. So, it’s these cases that we will have to watch out for, especially after the festival season.

Giridhara R. Babu: The most dense areas might have already been affected, whether it’s the metros or the tier-2 and tier-3 cities. While the infection is spreading temporarily from one area to another, we cannot certainly say that the worst is over yet. Until we touch the baseline, which is rock bottom, we will not be able to know whether another peak is visible. In my experience with measles and polio, even a slight deviation from the cohort of susceptible people versus how the infection is spreading will ensure that a bigger peak comes much faster, especially when people have been hiding away from the virus. So, we will have to see how it plays out during the winter and afterwards, especially when people start mixing with young people who can spread the infection to the elderly and to those who have co-morbidities. It is not a single wave at the national level which we should be looking at; instead, we should be looking at the State level. We should also be looking at the data from serological surveys, verbal autopsies and missed deaths from the States that are not reporting well, to understand the real nature of the peak.

Except Telangana, the other southern States have been reporting a high number of daily new cases, while large populous States such as U.P., M.P., and Bihar have reported far fewer cases. How do you explain this enigma?

Giridhara R. Babu: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Just because the southern States or some other States, including some in the north, are reporting more cases does not mean that only these States have circulation going on and other States have controlled it. Saying that only a few States have higher transmission compared to others is a statistical fallacy. This is the biggest trap we have seen in many infectious diseases. Due to integrity of reporting cases, many States get classified as high-risk States. The same thing happened, for instance, in the HIV programme. We should not repeat that mistake. We should build strong and resilient systems of data collection and reporting.

There are many ways of assessing whether a State has already gone past the surge in cases or whether it is yet to surge. One of the key things I would like to see is State-level serological surveys throughout the State, and also pick some infections in the acute phase. Testing randomly throughout the State will help us know the case-to-infection ratio, and comparisons between reported cases versus those who have already developed antibodies. Knowing what proportion of people in the general population have positivity by doing random antigen tests and RT-PCR and verbal autopsies of deaths will tell us whether the State has gone past the surge in cases or is yet to surge.

Comment | Imperatives after India’s September virus peak

Gautam Menon: Data are vital. What we need is much more granular data that will give us a better idea of whether it is just lack of reporting or insufficient testing that is governing these numbers or whether there is a genuine reason to be happy.

But some of these States, like U.P., have been doing a high number of daily tests, yet the cases are low. Is it because of over-reliance on rapid antigen tests or under-reporting?

Gautam Menon: The ratio of RAT to PCR test is fairly high in both Bihar and U.P. The method of who you test and what level you test is certainly an issue. Also, whether the testing is done broadly enough in the general population to pick up certain numbers is a question. As a fraction of the absolute population of the State, those test numbers are not good on their own.

Coronavirus | India has been able to ‘distribute the curve’ of COVID-19 infection due to ‘very effective lockdown’: ICMR

Giridhara R. Babu: Also important is when the testing is done. If testing is increased at a time when the surge in cases has not happened already, or the surge in cases has already happened, the number of people who are actually infected might be low. So, if the tests are increased when prevalence is low, you will obviously pick up fewer numbers. And we don’t know which districts are in which stage of transmission in several States.

The Indian Council of Medical Research’s second sero survey says over 7% of the adult population has been infected and the virus has spread to the rural districts. Is testing really good in rural areas or will these areas see a surge later?

Giridhara R. Babu: I feel that there is disparity in the way we test in metros and urban areas and in rural areas, which is a function of this trend of the health system as such. The ICMR survey gave a clear approximation that the infection has spread to rural areas, at least in the surveyed areas. The rural areas should not be ignored; we will have to do more testing in rural areas to corroborate that. We also need to understand whether the rural dynamics of transmission are similar to urban areas. And that can only be known by doing more sero surveys there. We still don’t know what proportion of people are acutely infected and yet not detected. So it’s a sum total of all these things that will give a clearer picture. Without that kind of granular data, we will not be able to say whether rural areas have missing transmission or not.

Coronavirus | Possibility of second wave in winter season cannot be ruled out, says V.K. Paul

Gautam Menon: From informal reports it does seem like many more people in rural areas are ill than are actually going in to be tested. Also, the delays in getting tested after falling ill, and in getting tested and getting a result, are significant in the progression of the disease from person to person.

The expert committee has projected a minimal number of fresh cases by end-February. Is it correct based on mathematical modelling to project for a period of four months during the pandemic?

Gautam Menon: Well, I would not do that and I would not recommend that anyone does it either with any degree of confidence. I think all one can say is that this particular model with these particular numbers show that cases will come down for three or four months down the line. But we have no reason to believe that those numbers will remain the same, the parameters in that model will remain the same. A much better index is what is the fraction of the population of the country that you think is currently infected. And that will tell you how many more people are there to be infected.

Coronavirus | September accounted for 41.53% of total cases in India

Currently there are about 7.5 lakh active cases but the committee says it will drop to 50,000 in December. Do you think it’s feasible?

Gautam Menon: It could be unusual for that to happen. They believe that 300-400 million people in India are already infected, which seems a little too high to me. I think 200-million plus is probably a reasonable ballpark figure. There are lots of people yet to be infected, a lot of them are in areas that have not been exposed yet. So, at what rate they will get infected is the important question. I suspect that there will be a background of infection as we go towards the next couple of months. It will not dip very significantly at least for the next two or three months.

Giridhara R. Babu: These predictions are good as long as they serve the purpose of planning, ensuring that we are stepping up our resources. But then if they give some kind of robust confidence that all is well and we might be free from this disease beyond December, I don’t think any of us have that kind of optimism yet. I would want to look at seven days average, at the minimum, to understand what is going to happen in the next seven days.

Editorial | A tool for thought: On coronavirus pandemic in India

Gautam Menon: Yes, I agree. I don’t see what the point is of saying that something’s going to happen four months later when we don’t have enough knowledge. A week, two weeks in advance is the best that one can do. I worry that putting such a long horizon serves a political purpose rather than a public health purpose.

The committee has not been able to provide any valid explanation for why India seems to have peaked. What could be the reasons considering that India has gone through various stages of unlock and movement of people has increased?

Giridhara R. Babu: The data suggest that areas that were prone to increased population movement and where people were working even when the lockdown was there and who did not follow the public health regulations were the ones who got the earlier waves of circulation. With the most dense areas having been affected already, it’s only the lesser population density areas which are the next focus. Therefore, the speed at which it will spread is going to be different from what it was earlier. The test positivity is also going down as testing numbers have not majorly decreased. Definitely there seems to be some decrease in cases but since we have not touched the baseline, we can’t be sure that this is over.

Editorial | Pandemic peak: On Finance Ministry's report

What will the combined effect of the festival season, winter, unrestricted movement of people, opening up of business establishments and non-adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions be on the virus spread?

Giridhara R. Babu: We don’t know what has happened before to actually know what is happening now and to predict what’s going to happen in the future. Let’s assume region A has already had a surge in cases and nearly 40%-50% of the people have been infected. So, even if festivals are celebrated and people congregate, one may not see that kind of a spike in cases in that region. Whereas, in region B, if the earlier surge was not there, the same kind of behaviour might result in big hotspots and many deaths. We don’t know what’s happening at the district level. So we need to make a beginning of trying to understand what is happening in each district to be able to predict which districts require more care. We are not using the data in the wisest manner. That’s my worry.

322,2020/10/23,Unrest in Pakistan: On movement against Imran Khan government,"Popular sentiment is building against the Army and the government

Events in Pakistan’s Sindh province in the last few days indicate that the Imran Khan government is dealing with a serious political crisis, perhaps its biggest, since taking office in 2018. Eleven Opposition parties, which have now formed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), have held two mammoth rallies, part of a plan for nationwide agitations, calling for the resignation of the PTI government over law and order, food shortages, inflation and gas cuts. They have called the Prime Minister both a failure at governance and the military’s “puppet”. But what has surprised many is their solidarity as well as the sharpness of their attack: at the rally in Gujranwala, former PM and Pakistan Muslim League (N) chief Nawaz Sharif, speaking from London, named Army Chief Gen. Qamar Bajwa and ISI chief Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed for “rigging elections”, restrictions on the media, harassment of journalists, putting pressure on the judiciary and subverting other democratic institutions. While most Pakistani politicians, Mr. Khan included, have attacked Pakistan’s omnipotent military establishment when in opposition, and drop the rhetoric when they come to power, Mr. Sharif’s comments indicate a popular sentiment that is chafing at the curbs by the Pakistani establishment. The PTI government’s response is a well-worn script. For the past few months, government prosecutors, on Mr. Khan’s orders, have focused on preparing cases to send as many members of the Opposition to prison. The co-chairperson of the Pakistan’s People’s Party and former Pakistan President, Asif Ali Zardari, is already in custody on money laundering charges, while the government has requested the U.K. many times to extradite Mr. Sharif so that he can be charged and tried again.

With the next generation of Bilawal Bhutto and Maryam Nawaz taking the stage at PDM rallies, the government swung into its next act: arresting Ms. Nawaz’s husband, Captain Safdar, after a midnight raid on their hotel in Karachi, charging him with disrespecting Jinnah’s mausoleum by raising anti-government slogans there. What made matters erupt was the arrest that had reportedly been carried out after Army rangers surrounded the Sindh Inspector General’s home and forced him to sign the FIR against Mr. Safdar. Top echelons of Sindh’s police force, backed by the Provincial PPP government, rose in outrage, applying en masse for leave after expressing their distress over the humiliation meted out to their chief. This was an unprecedented response which could have seen a more serious stand-off between the police and the Army. Matters are under control for the moment after Gen. Bajwa has promised an inquiry report on the controversial arrest within the next 10 days. However, with politics on the boil again and the PDM planning at least four more rallies this year, it is clear that Pakistan’s ruling party will find its feet held to the fire more frequently.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unrest-in-pakistan-the-hindu-editorial-on-movement-against-imran-khan-government/article32922008.ece
323,2020/10/23,"Sooner, better: The Hindu editorial on indigenously developed COVID-19 test kits","Indigenously developed tests will allow scaling up of efforts to detect infections

Thanks to the pandemic, scientific institutions in India have been able to demonstrate their ability to rise to the occasion and show why the country should increase funding for science research and development. The ICMR’s approval, recently, of two indigenously developed tests that are rapid, low-cost and have high sensitivity and specificity provides the much-needed boost to scale up daily testing without diluting accuracy. After carrying out about one million tests each day for the last few weeks, India, for the first time, tested nearly 1.5 million samples on October 21. While most tests done each day were the low sensitivity rapid antigen tests, the ones developed by the Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, a CSIR institute, and IIT Kharagpur will now enable the shift to more accurate tests. The low sensitivity of rapid antigen tests has meant that even people with symptoms were being handed out a negative result nearly half the time, leading to undetected cases. With unrestricted movement, businesses opening up, the festival season beginning and winter around the corner, the requirement for a rapid, low-cost test with high accuracy is crucial in checking the virus spread through early detection and repeated testing of even asymptomatic cases. Having locally developed tests with higher accuracy will now help States to offer tests on demand — as required in a September 4 ICMR advisory — while keeping costs low.

While the low sensitivity of rapid antigen tests arises from not isolating the viral RNA from the swab samples and amplification of the DNA before detection, the two indigenously developed tests follow these two vital steps, the reason why the sensitivity and specificity are far superior to that of the rapid antigen tests. But, at the same time, both the tests developed locally do require minimum laboratory infrastructure to isolate the viral RNA from the samples. For that reason, India has to still rely on rapid antigen tests in rural areas that have no laboratory infrastructure. But the tests developed by the Indian institutions, once commercially available, can readily replace the rapid antigen tests in places where such laboratory infrastructure is in place. Rapid antigen tests will become less important even in rural areas once research institutions succeed in developing protocols and tests for using saliva rather than swabs, and do not require isolation of viral RNA from patient samples before amplification and detection. Field testing and validation of such protocols is now pending. Relying on saliva samples would mean non-invasive sample collection, and probably even self-collection. Thus, the reliance on trained personnel would reduce and also minimise the risk of health workers getting infected.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sooner-better-the-hindu-editorial-on-indigenously-developed-covid-19-test-kits/article32922016.ece

325,2020/10/23,₹2 lakh fine if caught doing bike stunts in Bengaluru a second time,"Pay up ₹50,000 for defective silencers

The Bengaluru city police is getting tough on bikers performing wheelies and tampering with their silencers.

First-time offenders will now have to submit an undertaking before the jurisdictional Deputy Commissioners of Police, along with a bond under Section 107 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure).

If they are caught again for the same offence, it will enable the police to slap a fine of ₹50,000 against those using defective silencers, and ₹2 lakh against those performing wheelstands and other stunts.

Bengaluru City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant said the traffic police had submitted a report before the special traffic court and obtained permission to take action as per the new rule. Defective silencers and bike stunts cause sound pollution and endanger people’s safety, he said.

Undertaking

On Thursday, the first day of the drive, the Basavanagudi traffic police booked three motorcycle riders for defective silencers. They were asked to give an undertaking with a bond to the DCP (South) and let off with a regular fine.

The Electronics City traffic police booked 16 bikers for performing wheelies and got an undertaking from them. “The drive will be extended to other parts of the city from Friday,” Mr. Pant added.

Legal action against mechanics

The traffic police are now empowered to take action against mechanics and garage owners found tampering with the bikes and silencers.

326,2020/10/23,Cyber fraud: 4 arrested for impersonating police officers,"The gang allegedly created fake social media accounts using Aadhaar card details

Police officials with the cyber crime division of the CID arrested four persons from Rajasthan for allegedly creating fake social media accounts of police officers and government servants in a scam to extract money from their contacts. A police team tracked down the accused to Bharatpur and arrested Ansar, Balwinder Singh, Saini and Saddam. “We are on the lookout for a fifth person, Shakeel, who allegedly created the fake profiles,” said a senior police officer.

The accused would get details of their targets’ friends list on Facebook, then make a fake profile using an official photo and send requests for financial help to their contacts via the site’s messaging app. Recently, the cyber crime division received as many as four complaints, three from senior police officers.

According to the police, they gang created fake Aadhaar cards by mixing various photographs, addresses and numbers. They used this information to get SIM cards.

Ansar, a retailer of SIM cards, would apply for a SIM with these fake identity papers while Balwinder Singh, who works for a leading telecom service provider, got them activated.

DIG (Economic Offences) Rohini Katoch Sepat, who supervised the investigation, said that similar cases had been registered in other parts of Karnataka. “Over 10 such cases were filed in different police stations across the State,” she said.

In addition to impersonating their targets on Facebook, the investigation revealed that the accused used fake SIM cards to open various social media accounts, advertise on online re-selling platforms, open e-wallets and payment bank accounts to commit various online financial crimes across the country, the officer added.

“The investigation has revealed the misuse of Aadhaar to avail of SIM cards.

327,2020/10/23,"BMRCL accepts expert panel’s suggestion, 59 trees saved","HC asks company to pause till November 4 on removing 68 trees based on permission granted by panel

The Karnataka High Court on Thursday directed the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) not to go ahead with felling 39 trees and translocating 29 trees at various locations of the metro project till November 4, the next date of hearing on a PIL petition.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the interim order as the 15-day waiting period for the BMRCL to execute permission granted for removing trees will come to an end on November 1, before the court takes up hearing of the petition on November 4, and the petitioners are required to file their responses to the permission granted.

Initially, the BMRCL had submitted an application for removing 130 trees at various locations in BTM Layout, government ITI college ground , Dairy Circle, Lakkasandra and M.G Road.

Adjusted location of yard

However, the BMRCL decided to retain 59 of the 63 trees identified for axing in the government ITI college ground for building a fabrication yard. The company readjusted the yard structure location on the suggestions made by the Technical Expert Committee (TEC), which includes experts from the Department of Forestry and Environmental Sciences of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru.

Of the remaining 71 trees, the TEC granted permission for removing 68 trees (for felling 39 trees and for translocating 29) while asking the BMRCL to retain three more trees at BTM Layout as they were at the boundary of the project and not hindering construction activities.

The tree officer of the BBMP had on October 17 granted permission as per the advise of the TEC.

Tree census

Meanwhile, the BBMP said that census of around 30,000 trees has been completed. The civic body would give a geo-tag for every tree covered under the census as it was pointed out by the petitioner’s counsel that not all the trees covered have been given a geo-tag.

BBMP counsel said that he had advised officials geo-tag every tree. The bench was also of the view that the correct way would be to geo-tag every tree.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bmrcl-accepts-expert-panels-suggestion-59-trees-saved/article32921090.ece

329,2020/10/23,LED streetlight project finally takes off,"First phase expected to be completed by April 2021

The ambitious plan of replacing the city’s nearly five lakh streetlights with energy-efficient LED lights is finally beginning to take off. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had announced the project in 2018 with the expectation of completing it by 2021.

Under the first phase, one lakh streetlights will be replaced. The fitting of the new lights is expected to begin by December 2020. The consortium that had bagged the global tender had been directed to complete Phase 1 of the project by April 2020, but that deadline has long passed.

Last week, BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad held a meeting with officials and fixed new deadlines. He told The Hindu that the survey of 65,690 streetlights in Rajarajeshwarinagar, Bommanahalli and Dasarahalli zones has been completed. “The survey in the rest of the zones is likely to be completed in another 20 days,” he said, adding that officials have been directed to take Bengaluru Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM) on board for the survey, infrastructure work and rate contract to be floated by the BBMP.

Though the Letter of Intent was issued to the consortium in 2019, the actual work began in June this year. The International Financial Corporation, a sister concern of the World Bank, is the transactional advisor for the project.

Earlier this year, former BBMP commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar had stated that the civic body would recommend to the State government to cancel the global tender since the work was yet to be taken up.

Admitting that this indeed was the case, Mr. Prasad said some approvals were holding up the work. “All the necessary approvals have been issued and the work has begun,” he said.

The civic body spends ₹12 crore on an average every month on streetlights. The project was conceived with the aim of reducing the expenditure on electricity.

The consortium has assured 84.5% energy efficiency.

“It is a win-win for BBMP, which will not be spending on capital investment. The consortium will pay the BBMP 20% of the energy savings and retain the rest towards recovering capital investment. It is also obliged to maintain and operate the LED streetlights for the next 10 years,” Mr. Prasad added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/x5emj3/article32920941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGSTREETP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/led-streetlight-project-finally-takes-off/article32920944.ece
330,2020/10/23,D.J. Halli violence: New police station to come up at Govindapura,"The move was reportedly spearheaded by the Home Minister

The Home Ministry has carved out a new police station at Govindapura, which has been carved out of the jurisdictions of the D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli police stations, which were hit by violence on August 11. The move is aimed at strengthening policing in the ‘area, which is prone to a high crime rate and law and order issues, like seen recently’, said a senior official.

All three police stations have now been reorganised as a police sub-division to be headed by an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP).

The move, reportedly spearheaded by the Home Minister, has not only come under severe criticism by activists as “politically motivated and communally targeted”, but has also caused dissatisfaction among the police brass for reportedly being kept in the dark, sources said.

“While a new police station has been carved out, no new staff has been sanctioned, which defeats the purpose of a new station in the area,” said a police officer. At the same time, he argued that once staffed, it will help the police tackle the growing crime rate and population density.

Another officer justified the development citing the violence on August 11 when both D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli stations were attacked by mobs. “There is an element of lawlessness in the area. There is a need for the police to dominate the area,” said the officer.

However, the approach of increasing policing as a solution to the recent violence in the area has come under severe criticism.

“A preliminary analysis of August 11 violence shows that there is a lack of trust between citizens and the police, which was at the root of the violence. The problem is not less policing but bad policing,” said Vinay Sreenivasa, a member of a citizen-led fact-finding committee that examined the violent attacks.

Senior human rights advocate B.T. Venkatesh said, “The problem is that governments see everything through the prism of law and order. Clamping down on the area with more police may end up worsening the problem. The move seems to be politically motivated with communal undertones.”

Activists pointed out that the rise in crime and violence cannot be addressed in isolation. “There are many social aspects, like high rate of unemployment and malnutrition, as documented in the fact-finding report. It was here that a six-year-old girl died of malnutrition in 2013. If the government has acknowledged high prevalence of drug abuse in the area, why not open rehabilitation centres,” said Mr. Sreenivasa.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dj-halli-violence-new-police-station-to-come-up-at-govindapura/article32920799.ece

This was decided at a meeting held in the market on Thursday. Wholesale merchants said the market would allow up to 250 vehicles daily as festive days are near. S. Srinivasan, president, Chennai Fruits Commission Agents’ Association, said, “We are now open till 9 a.m. But we requested an extension as more trucks will arrive to meet the increasing demand due to the festivals.”

It would be difficult to manage the trucks in the small space allotted in the temporary market. So, the merchants had sought more time for sales. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority has now extended business hours till 2 p.m. till Sunday, he said.

The fruits merchants also demanded that the market be shifted to the Koyambedu complex like the vegetable and food grains market. It may be recalled that the 200 shops were allotted in the Madhavaram market in May after Koyambedu market was closed as it turned out to be a COVID-19 hotspot.

Sources in the Koyambedu Market Management Committee said there could be an announcement on the reopening of other sections of the market next week.

336,2020/10/23,"Physics is easy if problems can be visualised, say experts","If students can visualise the situations in three-dimension and apply the concepts, they would be able to solve the problem, according to teachers.

Those who took the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test and Joint Engineering Entrance Exam this year had something similar: most of them found Physics tough.

A few students who qualified in NEET said they had skipped the Physics paper. The negative marking for these competitive exams has required students to be proficient in the subjects to avoid negative marking for wrong answers.

Pavan Kumar, a Physics teacher for JEE, said the student feedback was that the subject was tougher, perhaps even the hardest compared to both Biology and Chemistry. Physics tests students’ understanding of concepts. Though schools teach theory and concepts they do not provide the context, said Balaji Sampath, founder of Aha Guru.

“In schools some training is given to learn procedural mathematics and then apply them. The physical world requires visualisation of the problem,” he explained.

If students can visualise the situations in three-dimension and apply the concepts, they would be able to solve the problem.

Physics problems are tough because there are certain expectations from the student, including being good at mathematics. Simply put, Mr. Sampath said children were forever experimenting. The rigours of school scuttled their natural instinct, he added.

Rita John, head of Theoretical Physics, University of Madras, agreed that the lack of training of teachers in teaching the new text books did the students in. She was also the domain expert and member for the State Board Class 11 and 12 physics text books.

“The book is excellent, it has proved itself. Ironically, the students who did well were those who depended on the textbook. Around 28 of 45 questions were almost directly from the book. Coaching centres in Kerala and Hyderabad were using our textbooks,” she said.

“Physics is not an easy subject if you do not understand. If you do then you will do very well. Though our students had the material in hand they did not use it,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/physics-is-easy-if-problems-can-be-visualised-say-experts/article32922933.ece

339,2020/10/23,Coronavirus | Serosurvey finds that 32.3% residents in Chennai have developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,"Directorate of Public Health identifies 888 clusters across Tamil Nadu for new study

The second serological survey in the city has found that one-third of the population has been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and has developed antibodies.

According to the Greater Chennai Corporation, of the 6,389 samples tested, 2,062 were positive for the presence of IgG antibodies, recording an overall positivity of 32.3%.

In fact, the first serological survey, the results of which were released in early September, found that one-fifth of the population in the city was exposed to the infection.

Meanwhile, the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and Preventive Medicine has launched a State-wide serosurvey with a sample size of 26,640. According to a press release, the population-based serosurvey had been taken up across cities and villages in the State.

A total of 888 clusters have been identified for the survey. In each cluster, the survey would cover 30 houses, collecting details and blood samples from 26,640 persons in total. It would screen the samples for the presence of antibodies against COVID-19.

District-wise enumeration

An official said the sample size was determined based on the population of the district. These samples would be tested in the State Public Health Laboratory in Chennai and other public health laboratories in Coimbatore, Salem, Tiruchi, Madurai and Tirunelveli. For this, high-end laboratory equipment worth ₹4 crore would be put to use. Chemiluminescent immunoassay technique would be used for the test.

Public health teams were formed and trained to identify persons and take up testing in every district.

The process would be completed by the second week of November. The survey was jointly taken up with IDFC, Mumbai, through a memorandum of understanding.

At the end of the survey, the average number of persons affected by COVID-19 in the State would be enumerated at the level of each district.

The findings of the survey would help the State government and the Health Department in coming up with policies, the release said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sp3lgr/article32923230.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23OCTTHSEROSURVEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/serosurvey-finds-that-323-residents-in-chennai-have-developed-sars-cov-2-antibodies/article32923231.ece
340,2020/10/23,Thunderstorms leave arterial roads in Chennai waterlogged,"The city suburbs experience heavy rainfall lasting over an hour

The sudden thunderstorms that lashed the city and its suburbs on Thursday evening resulted in several roads being submerged in water, leading to traffic snarls. But water receded once the rain stopped, with officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation and the Highways Department taking steps to remove blocks in the stormwater drains.

Officials of the Meteorological Department said the weather stations at Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam received 6 cm and 4 cm of rain respectively. However, it was more intense thunder showers than cloudburst as the rainfall recorded was spread over nearly three hours. Nearly 10 cm of rainfall needs to be recorded in an hour for a cloudburst.

The intense shower that lasted more than an hour caused flooding of arterial roads, including Poonamallee High Road, G.P. Road, Besant Road at Triplicane, Pantheon Road, E.V.K. Sampath Salai at Vepery, Anna Nagar 2nd Avenue, and parts of Anna Salai, leading to motorists and pedestrians facing severe hardships.

T. Ramachandran, who resides in Triplicane, said, “Traffic was moving slowly from Tambaram due to rainwater flooding the arterial roads. Several roads witnessed bumper-to bumper traffic because of rainwater stagnation.”

S. Arun, a resident of Anna Nagar, complained about sheets of rainwater stagnating on Anna Nagar 2nd Avenue, causing hardships to motorists.

A senior official of the Corporation said, “More than 42 mm of rainfall was reported in the corporation limits, with 30.2 mm reported in the Teynampet zone alone in one hour. For such heavy rain, water would stagnate for long. Work to drain out water from Anna Salai and Poonamallee High Road was initiated by the Highways Department...”

The civic official said that in other areas, including G.P. Road, Besant Road, Pantheon Road and Anna Nagar 2nd Avenue, rainwater drained half-an-hour after the rain stopped, with officials deputed to vulnerable roads.

S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said a combination of factors comprising an east-west shear zone and the depression over the north-west and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal influenced the heavy spell of rain within a few hours.

Such thunderstorm activity, with lightning, will continue till Monday in isolated places as it is the transition period to the northeast monsoon.

Light to moderate rainfall will occur in some districts, including Salem, Dharmapuri, Ranipet and Kancheepuram, on Friday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dxfdxh/article32923207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THWATERLOGGING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/thunderstorms-leave-arterial-roads-in-chennai-waterlogged/article32923208.ece
341,2020/10/23,"As normal services resume, hospitals in Chennai take steps to manage patient inflow","Post-lockdown, outpatient services and elective surgeries have resumed in many government hospitals, resulting in an increase in the inflow of people.

Handling both COVID-19 and usual patients simultaneously has led to hospitals taking additional measures to manage crowds and ensure adherence to precautionary norms.

With the lifting of lockdown restrictions, the number of outpatients visiting government hospitals is on the rise. While the Rajiv Gandhi Government Government General Hospital (RGGGH) is now receiving 7,000 to 8,000 outpatients a day, the outpatient census at the Government Stanley Medical College (SMC) Hospital is 4,000, and around 2,500 to 3,000 at the Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital.

“We have started regular surgeries, and our departments are functioning in full swing. The departments have been split into two, one involved in treating COVID-19 patients and the other for normal patients,” P. Balaji, SMC dean, said. He added that they were making arrangements to create additional entry and exit points to manage the crowd flow into the trauma block.

At RGGGH, where elective surgeries have resumed after the lockdown, seating arrangements with appropriate spacing have been put in place for patients and their attendants.

Dean E. Theranirajan said stickers had been pasted on alternate seats to ensure adequate spacing and sufficient number of doctors had been posted in outpatient departments. “We have issued passes for in-patient attendants,” he said.

Doctors are insisting that people should wear masks and maintain physical distancing. At KMC, authorities said measures had been taken to ensure that adequate spacing was maintained in the general outpatient departments.

The hospital has been performing surgeries with departments such as obstetrics and gynaecology, trauma, burns, paediatrics and orthopaedics functioning as usual even during the lockdown. “We still have 10 persons coming to the hospital for one patient. People should avoid unnecessary visits. We have to ensure that there is no overcrowding to prevent transmission of COVID-19,” a senior doctor in a maternity hospital said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xsa4a1/article32923203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22OCTTHCITY-MATTERS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/as-normal-services-resume-hospitals-in-chennai-take-steps-to-manage-patient-inflow/article32923204.ece
342,2020/10/23,Government hospitals in Chennai continue ramping up COVID-19 infrastructure,"Even as fresh infections seem to be on the decline, institutions are gearing up to ensure continuum of care for patients by setting up post-COVID clinics

Since the start of the pandemic, government hospitals in the city have been steadily improving their infrastructure to manage COVID-19 patients. Post-lockdown, with the city and its people returning to normalcy, work to increase the bed strength, oxygen capacity and ensure continuum of care for patients by setting up post-COVID clinics is going on in many of these hospitals.

The city has so far recorded a total of 1,93,299 cases — 1,78,623 persons discharged, 11,107 active cases and 3,569 deaths. As fresh infections seem to be on the decline, hospitals continue to ramp up COVID-19 related infrastructure facilities, such as beds with oxygen support, liquid oxygen tanks and post-COVID clinics, in tune with the changing needs of the pandemic.

The Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) has so far admitted nearly 25,713 patients. From 10 beds, the hospital, in a phased manner, has increased its bed strength to 1,662.

“This will be increased to 2,000 in the coming weeks. We are adding 120 beds on each floor of tower-3. We will be covering three more floors to convert the tower into an exclusive COVID-19 block. This way, we will wind up smaller wards for COVID-19 patients in other blocks such as tower-2 and speciality block. The number of oxygen points were also increased to 1,000,” E. Theranirajan, RGGGH dean, said.

The inflow of patients had been fluctuating with the daily average being less than 150.

Presently, there were 710 patients, including the ones with COVID-19 and those with suspected symptoms, he added.

Of the total 2,261 beds at the Government Stanley Medical College (SMC) Hospital, 1,200 beds are for COVID-19 patients. Out of this, 1,000 are oxygen supported beds, including 280 ventilator beds, according to dean P. Balaji. Three blocks were remodelled for COVID-19 patients. Of this, a two-storey block with 400 beds was exclusively earmarked. It offered outpatient services, in-patient wards and a zero-delay ward. A separate dialysis ward with 10 beds was put in place. Like other hospitals, the SMC has started a follow-up clinic with pulmonologists, cardiologists and psychiatrists managing it.

One of the first exclusive COVID-19 hospitals was the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate. Started in March with 500 beds, the capacity was augmented with 250 more beds — all with oxygen support.

Testing capacity

“We have increased the testing capacity of our RT-PCR laboratory with an automated RNA extractor. From 100 to 200 samples a day, we are now testing 800 to 1,000 samples a day. We have added 104 ventilators and 150 multipara monitors,” said R. Jayanthi, the hospital’s dean. The number of in-patients had reduced to below 500 for the first time in months, she added.

The Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital that started off with four beds has a total of 550 beds now. “We are planning to add 110 more beds of which 100 will be for the ICU and 10 in the modular mobile ICU. This will take the total beds to 660 in the future,” dean P. Vasanthamani said.

In August, a record of 1,900 patients were admitted to the hospital, 10 affiliated COVID-19 Care Centres and two screening centres. “Nearly two weeks ago, the number of patients admitted decreased to around 700 to 800. In the last two days, it has come down to 500,” she added.

The National Institute of Ageing (Government Corona Hospital) in Guindy, is maintaining 750 beds. K. Narayanasamy, its director, said they had a 15-bed zero delay ward with oxygen ports and ventilators available for all beds. “We are going to increase the oxygen tank capacity from 6 KL to 10 KL,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hz9csw/article32923196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22OCTTHCITY-MATTERS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/government-hospitals-in-chennai-continue-ramping-up-covid-19-infrastructure/article32923164.ece

344,2020/10/23,Corporation to form committees to redress complaints on ISWD project,"The Integrated Storm Water Drainage project is being executed in six divisions along the East Coast Road

The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has decided to form local committees to redress the complaints of residents who are against the Integrated Storm Water Drainage (ISWD) project being executed in six divisions along the East Coast Road (ECR).

The plan to have local committees comprising the Assistant Executive Engineers and Assistant Engineers was decided in a meeting organised by the civic body, for members of residents welfare associations, at Amma Maligai in the city on Thursday.

This was done to clarify doubts and highlight positive features of the ISWD project in preventing rainwater from flowing into the sea.

Residents and representatives from various associations and fishing communities attended the two-hour long meeting and raised concerns about the project. They noted that civic body officials have assured to provide them a detailed project report and hold further discussions.

Chitra Rajan, a resident of Akkarai, said, “Many residents pointed out that there were other civic amenities that needed to be given priority, including better water supply and sewer networks. Areas along the ECR do not need storm water drainage as the sandy soil allows for the natural percolation of water. We have asked the civic body not to carry out the project without the consent of the residents”.

Residents also noted that the project would hinder the groundwater recharge system and was not necessary for localities along the ECR unlike other areas in the city. Ram Shankar, coordinator, Save Water and Recharge Aquifers Network, said several participants were not convinced about the project and insisted on dropping it. Even during the 2015 floods, areas along the ECR were not waterlogged and recharge wells would help better percolation.

A senior official of the civic body said that the local committees would take remedial measures of any complaints that the residents brought up.

Thousands of cubic metres of rainwater would be saved by creating percolating wells in the sandy areas to prevent rainwater from being wasted and flowing into the sea. He said that more than 20 eco block wells, 168 sunken wells and 2,000 percolation pits, have been proposed in divisions covering Kottivakkam, Palavakkam, Neelangarai, Injambakkam, Sholinganallur and Uthandi.

The Kovalam basin project is being funded by KfW, the German Development Bank, and the detailed project report was being prepared by Kocks Consultants, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corporation-to-form-committees-to-redress-complaints-on-iswd-project/article32922777.ece
345,2020/10/23,HC stays memo on exemption of building completion certificates for power connection,"Interim stay granted on a PIL filed by the Coimbatore Consumer Cause

The Madras High Court on Thursday stayed the operation of a memorandum issued by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) on October 6 exempting all those seeking new service connections from producing building completion certificates issued by the civic authorities concerned.

Justices V. Parthiban and G.R. Swaminathan granted the interim stay on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition filed by the Coimbatore Consumer Cause, a private society, through its counsel S. Sathia Chandran. The petitioner society claimed that the exemption was against a judicial order passed on January 9, 2018.

Filing a detailed affidavit on behalf of the society, its secretary, K. Kathirmathiyon, said provision of facilities such as electricity, drinking water and sewage connections to illegal and unauthorised constructions demoralise those who follow the laws and construct their buildings strictly in accordance with the rules.

Hence, a Division Bench of Justices M. Venugopal (since retired) and S. Vaidyanathan had in January 2018 disapproved of the practice of constructing buildings in violation of the approved plans. It also deprecated the practice of constructions made without a setback area and criticised the officials for turning a blind eye to such violations.

In the interest of the public at large, the judges had directed the officials concerned to issue building completion certificates only after ensuring that the structures had been built as per the approved plan and ordered that water, electricity and sewage connections should be provided to the buildings only on the submission of such certificates.

The court order was followed scrupulously since then.

Recently, the Director (Distribution) of Tangedco had issued the memorandum exempting the submission of such certificates and hence the present petition was filed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-stays-memo-on-exemption-of-building-completion-certificates-for-power-connection/article32922592.ece

The Tamil Nadu Magazine Publishers Association has written to the Chief Minister appealing for payment of dues to public libraries.

The members said that repeated requests to various departments resulted in the government providing ₹21 crore. But this was not enough to run the libraries, they added.

“We come under the School Education Department. There are around 4,600 public libraries and the funds to run libraries must come from the Local Administration Department. A portion of the revenue tax collected is allocated to run libraries. Since 2018, this amount has been pending and now it amounts to ₹351 crore,” said R. Sakthivel, president of the association.

The Chennai Corporation owes the District Library office a sum of ₹150 crore. This amount has to be distributed among the libraries in Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram.

“It was only after meeting the officials of six departments that the government released ₹21 crore. The public libraries have opened up but there are no publications for patrons to read. Together, libraries purchase around 150 publications, including 20 dailes, 30 weeklies and 40 monthlies,” he said.

The association had made several representations about the pending amount after which a new director was appointed. The official is yet to take charge.

In August 2016, just months before the United States presidential elections, then U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and India’s External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had detailed discussions about the Paris Climate Change Agreement, with the U.S. urging India to sign it at the earliest. Part of the statement they issued included the U.S.’s [developed countries] commitment to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020 as part of a Green Climate Fund (GCF) to help developing countries such as India with climate adaptation methods and renewable technologies.

Then, the Paris Accord push

The ratification of the Paris Agreement was then U.S. President Barack Obama’s legacy project, and Washington was pushing for India to join before election day, November 8, in a bid to help Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton with her campaign against Republican nominee Donald Trump, who was against the Paris deal.

While New Delhi could have chosen to wait for the results of the U.S. elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not, and announced a few weeks after Mr. Kerry’s visit that India would ratify the UN climate protocol on October 2, to mark Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday.

Months later, on June 1, 2017, the new U.S. President, Donald Trump, announced that the U.S. would exit the Paris agreement, and also revoked U.S. promises towards the GCF, calling it “very unfair”. “India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries,” Mr. Trump added, conveniently ignoring the fact that it was based on his predecessor’s promises that India had made its calculations.

This time, the Indo-Pacific

As the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, makes his way to India next week, history may just be repeating itself. This time, Mr. Pompeo is coming exactly a week before the election, and his brief is clear: to ensure that New Delhi (also Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia that are on his itinerary, from October 25 to October 30), makes a strong, public, strategic commitment to the U.S. on its plans in the Indo-Pacific. Mr. Pompeo has made no bones about his mission. In Washington on Wednesday, he said he was sure that his meetings “would include discussions about how free nations can work together to thwart threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party”.

Just a few weeks ago, at the Quad Foreign Ministers meeting in Tokyo, Mr. Pompeo had said that as partners in this Quad (Australia-India-Japan-U.S.), “it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the Chinese Communist Party’s exploitation, corruption, and coercion.” In contrast, India has maintained that its membership of the Quad is aligned to its Indo-Pacific policy, and as Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated at the Shangri-La dialogue, in June 2018, “by no means... directed against any country”. While there is no doubt that Beijing’s relentless aggression against India at the Line of Actual Control this year and its refusal to disengage or withdraw from land China’s People’s Liberation Army has occupied for more than six months is changing India’s priorities, the Narendra Modi government has maintained that it will resolve issues with China bilaterally. Any shift in that position at the U.S.’s prompting must also accrue benefits for India.

Electoral calculations

Mr. Pompeo’s tenuous position must also be considered closely. For one, it is by no means clear that Mr. Trump will win the presidential elections or that Mr. Pompeo will remain in that spot. In fact, all presidential polls, as well as predictions for the U.S. electoral college point to a probable win for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

Even if Mr. Trump does win the election, it remains to be seen how far he will take ties with China to the brink once he dusts off his campaign rhetoric. The weight of commitments made by Mr. Pompeo during his India visit could thus be assessed better in a similar visit made even a week later, once the election results are more clearly known.

In the event Mr. Biden wins the election, India will hardly have endeared itself to the incoming administration by making strong statements of solidarity with Trump policy, strategic or otherwise. The two rallies Mr. Modi has held with Mr. Trump in Houston (2019) and in Ahmedabad (2020), as well as his use of the Trump campaign slogan, “Ab ki baar Trump Sarkar”, have already been noted within the Democratic campaign, and it may be recalled that most supporters of India in the Democratic leadership skipped the Houston rally.

China and India’s three fronts

As a result, South Block must consider carefully just what it discusses and projects from the meeting with Mr. Pompeo and U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper as they arrive for the Third India-U.S. 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. China has gone from being the “Elephant in the Room” (as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun described it earlier this month) to becoming an agenda item on the table. Therefore, it is critical to study just how India hopes to collaborate with the U.S. on the challenge that Beijing poses on each of India’s three fronts: at the LAC, in the maritime sphere, and in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region surrounding India.

On the maritime sphere, discussions will no doubt include strengthening ties in the Indo-Pacific, enhancing joint military exercises like the ‘Malabar’, where the entire Quad including Australia will participate next month in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, and completing the last of the “foundational agreements” with the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Cooperation (BECA). On the SAARC region, Mr. Pompeo is speaking with his feet, given that his travels will take him to Male and Colombo as well. In Male, the U.S. has already announced a defence agreement that will pave the way for a strategic dialogue, and unlike in the past, New Delhi has not objected to ceding space in its area of influence in the Indian Ocean Region, as it will allow the U.S. to counter Chinese influence there. With Sri Lanka too, the U.S. has a pending defence agreement, but more importantly, discussions on infrastructure projects, and progress on its “Millenium Challenge Corporation” (MCC) offer of a five-year aid grant of about $480 million, that is meant to offer alternatives to the Rajapaksa government, will be key. At a time when India is delaying Sri Lanka’s requests for debt relief, given its own economic constraints, the U.S. aid offer will be seen as one way of staving off China’s inroads into Sri Lanka.

Finally, and of most interest, will be how the U.S. and India can collaborate, if they can, on dealing with India’s most immediate, continental challenge from China: at the LAC. While the Indian Army will defend its borders with China on its own, there is much that Mr. Pompeo could promise, apart from enhancing and expediting U.S. defence sales to India. Mr. Pompeo must, for example, commit to keeping the pressure on Pakistan on terrorism, despite the U.S. need for Pakistan’s assistance in Afghan-Taliban talks. A firm U.S. statement in this regard may also disperse the pressure the Indian military faces in planning for a “two-front” conflict with China.

Other key areas

Mr. Pompeo should be pushed on resolving trade issues with India, an area the Trump administration has been particularly tough, and perhaps commit to restoring India’s Generalised System of Preferences status for exporters. The government could press for more cooperation on 5G technology sharing, or an assurance that its S-400 missile system purchase from Russia will receive an exemption from the U.S.’s Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) sanctions.

Explained | How will purchases from Russia affect India-U.S. ties?

By inviting Mr. Pompeo this close to the U.S. elections, New Delhi has taken a calculated and bold gamble. Unlike the experience of 2016, however, our leaders must drive a harder bargain to consolidate the pay-offs from the visit.

348,2020/10/23,"Muttiah Muralitharan biopic: A compelling life story, lost in the fog of illogic","Critics have cast Murali as a ‘generic’ Sri Lankan Tamil to inflame their biases, but his story is more deeply layered

Occasionally, Muttiah Muralitharan has spoken of the anti-Tamil pogrom in 1977 when Sinhalese mobs ran a blade 12 inches across his father’s back, then burned down the family’s biscuit factory on the outskirts of the hill capital of Kandy, Sri Lanka.

In recent years, this harrowing story has been recounted at political events in support of Sri Lanka’s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and his Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People’s Front). The suggestion from Murali is that if he can forgive this heinous act of racial violence and go on to become one of Sri Lanka’s most celebrated figures, forgiveness should be beyond no one. This is glib, of course. For many Sri Lankan Tamils who suffered the appalling privations of war for decades, and were not insulated by the kind of wealth and status Murali enjoyed from his youth, forgiveness could not — and perhaps should not — come so easy.

Also read | Writer of Muralitharan biopic: ‘There are shades of grey in 800'

But is Murali any more guilty of simplistic reasoning than those who have spearheaded the backlash against his biopic, 800? Across social media, Murali has been flamed as a traitor to the “Tamil cause”; accused of sidling up to the Sinhalese to perform the role of the Tamil mascot through whom southerners lived out delusions of their own benevolence. That Murali’s forays into political conversation have ranged from naive to calamitous is plain. (It is a view held even by some of his closest confidants.) But the suggestion that he should uncritically attach himself to the “Tamil cause” requires investigation.

Many layers to history

There is layered history here. Thanks largely to its position along one of the planet’s busiest maritime routes, the island is a place of near-unfathomable ethnic, religious and historical complexity. Waves of migrants have arrived over several millennia, some from North and East India, from the Malabar coast, the Arabian gulf, and from Java, each group forming a unique relationship with the state. Tamils, likewise, had come in waves, for over 2,500 years, and Malayaha (hill country) Tamils, from among whom Murali hails, were among the last to make landfall, lured over by the British to live and labour in hill-country plantations in almost uniformly abysmal conditions, for little pay. More than 150 years into life on the island, Malayaha Tamils remain among the nation’s most impoverished ethnic groups, with most estate workers earning less than 800 rupees (about ₹320 Indian) a day. The community’s health care and education outcomes continue to desperately trail national averages.

The ‘Tamil cause’

More to the point, there has been no substantial political movement from Malayaha Tamils to join the separatist struggle that was produced in the north and east. For Tamils in the hills, economic concerns have long outstripped appetites for self-determination, and still do. Many also feel condescended to by northern Tamils, for their lower caste status, the recency of their arrival, and their use of a more common Tamil than the classical iteration of the language heard in Jaffna. If Murali is betraying the “Tamil cause”, which Tamil cause, exactly? Higher wages for plantation workers was not among the LTTE’s primary demands. Minorities are not always political monoliths.

Also read | In Sri Lanka, a people living off borrowed money

Although Murali himself grew up in relative wealth, his father and uncle having sold biscuits out of the back of a car to build the business up in the 1960s, it can be no surprise that it is poverty that Murali has concerned himself with in his considerable charitable works. Though at the peak of his cricketing career at the time, Murali had been a key figure in securing the resources to build more than 1,000 homes for tsunami victims after the 2004 disaster. In the years since he has supported significant humanitarian operations across the island. Perhaps this is tangential, but it is certainly not irrelevant. Murali has helped transform more lives through his goodwill than arguably any living cricketer. Many of those who have had his support are Tamils, particularly in the aftermath of the tsunami, when he personally organised and delivered a convoy of lorries filled with supplies to the north.

Perhaps we should not be surprised that in casting Murali as a generic Sri Lankan Tamil, with no mention of his particular community, his harshest critics have stumbled into the same mire of illogic that inflamed the Sinhalese who attacked central hill-country Tamils over separatist agitations in the north and east. Nationalism, of any stripe, makes no concession to complexity. It smelts nuance down to a razor tip, for it has use only for weapons. Only a poster announcing the film was seen, but Indian actor Vijay Sethupathi has been forced to withdraw from the project. Somehow, Murali had not been so toxic when he played for Chennai Super Kings between 2008 and 2010 — years in which the war whipped up to its furious conclusion.

Editorial | Heckler’s veto: On Vijay Sethupathi's withdrawal from Muralitharan biopic 800

Gripping script

If the film is canned following Sethupathi’s exit, one of sport’s most compelling stories will go untold on screen. Beyond his monumental cricketing exploits, Murali had also been strung up in a career-long tussle over his bowling action, which served as a flashpoint between the sport’s grudging western powers and South Asia’s burgeoning administrative heft. His politics have long been viewed as problematic, but who is to say 800 would not have enriched itself with such contentions? The latest novel from the film’s co-writer, Shehan Karunatilaka, is a searing critique of wartime Sri Lanka. Sethupathi’s track record suggests he possessed the depth and range to honestly and sensitively draw out the conflicts in Murali’s story. Lost on detractors was the notion there can be more than one kind of biopic. Just as there can be more than one kind of Sri Lankan Tamil.

349,2020/10/23,"Letters to the Editor — October 23, 2020","It is inhumane

It is shocking that post-independent India still entertains the abhorred occupation of manual scavenging when better methods of waste removal are available (OpEd page, “The manacles of caste in sanitation work”, October 22). How long will the exploitation of helpless oppressed citizens continue? States should join hands with the Union and come forward to abolish manual scavenging and allied activities that are synonymous with neo-slavery. The rehabilitation and skill development of scavengers are two areas which should be focused upon. Sectarian differences should be stopped and the right to life should be propagated with gusto.

Aravind Santhosh,

Thiruvananthapuram

The accompanying picture was disheartening — to see a manual scavenger nearly lost in a manhole filled with human waste and other solids. The Constitution, ironically, speaks of social justice requiring an abolition of inequities. Alas, it is just on paper as there is no mass movement to end the barbarous practice. The lack of social safety and security for manual scavengers should be a wake-up call to revamp policy. Else, it is meaningless to call ours a civilised society.

E.S. Chandrasekaran,

Chennai

It is tragic that even in today’s technologically advanced world, there is hardly any mechanisation in sanitation work in India. There must be an awakening among the general public to end the practice. Till such time, such workers need a union, medical insurance and a supervisor.

Rithi Andal Pooja V.,

Madurai

Deplorably, the caste syndrome and sanitation have become inextricably intertwined. This has resulted in the exploitation of manual scavengers, which has led to the perpetuation of the abominable practice. It is a pity that despite a plethora of laws banning this dehumanising practice, it has only become more entrenched in the system.

P.K. Varadarajan,

Chennai

Like it or not, sanitation relies heavily on the services of the most oppressed castes. Not only is the work itself degrading, it is also performed under extremely hazardous conditions. It is only when tragic incidents occur involving scavengers, that their social background, the indignities they face in society, and the risks they take come to light. There is a near-institutionalisation of such work. Ending the practice is a challenge India faces, which calls for a sustained approach.

R. Sivakumar,

Chennai

Health messaging

I have been a keen observer of people’s conduct during the novel coronavirus pandemic and find that a majority of Indians are still very negligent when it comes to proper mask wearing, their use of a sanitiser or following handwashing, and avoiding contamination of the nose and eyes. I do not think that even the exhortations of the Prime Minister will have much of an impact.

People on the street heed only direct and harsh instructions from the police and other local officials. There is no dearth of guidelines on the novel coronavirus safety protocol, but they do not seem to be reaching the public effectively (Editorial, “A crucial season”, October 22).

P. Mangalachandran,

West Ponniam, Kannur, Kerala

IPL woes

All great teams in sport have a sell by date. There comes a time when things begin to fall apart and M.S. Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings is no exception. The roaring lion in the game of cricket has become a kitten this IPL season. The team ‘think tank’ appears to be reluctant to give talented youngsters a chance. It is time the franchise owners brainstorm and invest in youngsters to build the future team.

350,2020/10/23,Eknath Khadse joins NCP,"Sharad Pawar rules out State Cabinet reshuffle

Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse on Friday joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the presence of party chief Sharad Pawar.

Ruling out the possibility of a reshuffle of the State Cabinet to accommodate Mr. Khadse, Mr. Pawar said the latter had not joined the NCP for any post.

He also rubbished reports that Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar was unhappy with Mr. Khadse’s entry. Mr. Ajit Pawar attended the function virtually as he is quarantined as a precaution though he had tested negative for COVID-19.

“I had offers from other parties as well; I would not lie. But not only my followers but even some BJP leaders advised me that if I had to join another party, then it should be the NCP,” Mr. Khadse said.

Mr. Khadse said no one should show him the fear of inquiry by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). “If you are bringing the ED, then I have a CD to show to all,” he said. He added that there were attempts to destroy his political career. “I did not blame anyone in the BJP but former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Fake cases like molestation were filed against me. I recently came out clear from it. I was also accused of grabbing land. Now, I will reveal who has taken how many plots,” Mr. Khadse said, amid sloganeering from his supporters.

The leader from north Maharashtra said that he was extending an invitation to the party leadership to come to Jalgaon after a few months to have a bigger function where his real power would be displayed.

Mr. Khadse, the number two in the cabinet of Mr. Fadnavis, had to resign following allegations of graft in 2016. Since then, he has been sulking and indirectly blaming Mr. Fadnavis for his ouster from the cabinet in a bid to thwart his chances of getting the CM post.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/eknath-khadse-joins-ncp/article32932940.ece

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday announced financial assistance of ₹10,000 crore for rain-affected people and areas in the State.

After chairing a meeting of Cabinet Ministers, Mr. Thackeray said the aid will reach the affected people, including farmers, by Deepavali. He said, “We reviewed the situation in totality and as per our promise not to forsake farmers, we have decided to allocate ₹10,000 crore as aid. These funds will be used to recoup losses caused to crops and fields, and repair damaged roads and electric poles.”

Mr. Thackeray said the Centre’s ₹6,800 compensation per hectare of arable land is insufficient and the State would give ₹10,000 per hectare, with a limit of up to two hectares. “Financial aid of ₹25,000 per hectare will be given for horticulture instead of ₹18,000 per hectare, with a limit of up to two hectares,” he said, adding that this is the highest amount given as aid by any State government.

Of the total package, ₹5,500 crore is reserved for the agriculture sector, ₹2,635 crore for repairing roads and bridges, ₹300 crore for urban development, ₹239 crore for restoring power utilities, ₹102 crore for water resources and ₹1,000 crore for repairing rural roads and restoring water supply.

Mr. Thackeray said, “The Centre has to pay the State ₹38,000 crore. Had they paid this amount, we would not have faced difficulties in announcing the relief package. I request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release the dues at the earliest.” He said if needed he will meet the PM to secure the dues.

Referring to the demands made by Mr. Thackeray during the crop loss last year, when the Shiv Sena was a BJP ally, Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, “Mr. Thackeray himself had demanded financial aid of ₹25,000 per hectare for rain-affected farmers. Today’s announcement has betrayed the trust of farmers.”

Mr. Thackeray said, “COVID-19 had not hit us financially when I had made this demand. The State is now struggling on the financial front. We need our dues from the Centre and the Leader of the Opposition should help us.”

Farmer organisations welcomed the announcement, but said they expected more aid, considering the huge losses. “The amount announced will not be enough for farmers.

“Pashankar went missing on October 21. We have recovered a note in which he has stated that he has been suffering losses in the business since the last two-three years and because of his decisions, his children are facing troubles,” a senior officer from Shivajinagar police station said.

The police have registered a missing person complaint and launched a search, the office said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/n6paxz/article32925923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/pashankar-auto2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/punes-leading-motorcycle-dealer-goes-missing/article32925917.ece
357,2020/10/23,"Mumbai mall blaze: 3,500 people evacuated from adjacent tower","Occupants of the 55-storey Orchid Enclave building in Mumbai Central have been evacuated after a major fire in the adjacent City Centre mall.

Mumbai’s City Central mall was caught on fire on Thursday night, resulting in the evacuation of 3,500 residents from an adjacent residential building.

Occupants of the 55-storey Orchid Enclave building in Mumbai Central have been evacuated after a major fire in the adjacent City Centre mall.

The second floor of the mall caught on fire at around 8.50 p.m. on Thursday. It spread on all three floors despite fire fighting efforts. At 2.41 a.m., the fire brigade department announced the fire as ‘brigade call.’ This means that the fire is a Level 5 one, the highest category, for which fire engines are called from all agencies in the city.

The mall is a ground plus three-floor structure. As per the primary information, the fire originated at the mobile, printer, stationary and furniture shops on the second floor from which it spread to the third floor, said an official communication from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

A total of 24 fire engines, 16 jumbo tanks are on site, and around 250 officials are on the ground.

The evacuated people have been moved to a nearby open ground as a safety precaution.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ljw28n/article32925247.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mumbafire,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-mall-blaze-3500-people-evacuated-from-adjacent-tower/article32925248.ece
358,2020/10/23,Another complaint filed against Kangana Ranaut,"Another criminal complaint was filed in the Andheri Magistrate Court on Thursday against actor Kangana Ranaut for sedition, causing disharmony among religions, and mocking the judiciary after the Bandra Magistrate Court ordered filing of an FIR against her.

The petitioner, advocate Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh, urged the court to take cognisance of her tweets, which he said promoted enmity between groups.

It said Ms. Ranaut had no respect for the varied communities of India, law of the land, and authorised government bodies. She had made fun of the judiciary, which amounted to criminal contempt.

He wanted an FIR to be registered against her under Sections 121 (waging, or attempting to wage a war, or abetting waging of war, against the government of India), 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 295A (deliberate and malicious act, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 298 (uttering words etc. with the deliberate intent to wound religious feelings), and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code.

360,2020/10/23,One for the road: Rediscovering the joys of road trips,"Hyderabadis have been rediscovering the joys of road trips to explore weekend getaways, despite the pandemic

Masks and sanitisers. Check. Food and water. Check. A good playlist for the road. Check. Bike, car or cycle in good condition. Check.

If you’re planning to head out of Hyderabad during a weekend, once the aftermath of the recent deluge paves way for better times, factor in extra time at the toll gates. The rush at the toll plazas has got to do with bikers and families heading out of town for a quick getaway from their WFH (work from home) routines.

Getaways Kondapochamma Sagar Reservoir, Anantagiri Hills, Medak Fort, Bidar, Nagarjuna Sagar, Mallela Theertham waterfalls, Nagarkurnool, Ramappa temple and lake in Warangal

Air and train travel aren’t as safe as they were during the pre-COVID era, and being home-bound for months hasn’t been too enticing. The last few weeks have witnessed more Hyderabad folks heading out of town to visit nearby destinations.

The months of lockdown and COVID-19 safety concerns have made us appreciate the little joys more than ever. International adventure trips or the luxury of infinity pools can wait, there are many destinations to explore within 200 kilometres from the city.

You are likely to find bikers along the Vikarabad highway, or families in cars heading towards the scenic Kondapochamma Sagar Reservoir in Siddipet district. These road trips also hark back to simpler times of carrying food and water from home for picnics. Some of the highway dhabas are open for business, but packing food is a good idea if you want to be cautious and avoid the crowds.

Before the pandemic, fashion designer Vyshnavi Reddy wouldn’t have thought of Rajeswara Rao Pet as a much-needed getaway from the bustling Hyderabad. “I thought I might get bored with village life but I enjoyed it during a recent trip. The facilities are basic for someone who is used to urban life, but this time I didn’t mind it at all,” she says, referring to a short stay at a family-owned house replete with old-world archways and deewankhana. “There’s a lot of open space where my son could play and we could observe the rural lifestyle at a leisurely pace,” she adds. Rajeswara Rao Pet is in the Karimnagar zone, and the family also visited nearby spots like the Manair Dam.

With shorter distances, there’s scope to break free from the desk-bound routine and step up physical activity. Ask the cyclists of Hyderabad. Some of them head out on solo rides or in groups of two to four.

Sanjay Yadav got tired of being homebound and cycling only in the neighbourhood, and decided to cycle to Anantagiri Hills, the round trip coming up to 191 kilometres. “The countryside was clean and green thanks to monsoon showers. We took lesser-explored routes and travelled through villages,” he shares.

Armed with masks, sanitisers, food and water, the journey began around 4.30 a.m. and he reached Anantagiri Hills by noon. “If you begin early and there’s less traffic, you can return home by 5 p.m.,” he adds. An avid cyclist, he had always led an active lifestyle. During the pandemic, he decided to prioritise health all the more and took up this trip.

Fellow cyclist Rajeev Kalwa is eagerly looking forward to the brevet season (rides of 200 kilometres upwards) organised by cycling associations in the country. Meanwhile, Rajeev has been exploring scenic routes in and around Hyderabad. The ORR service road loop, Medchal highway and Shankarpally are among his favourites. He also recommends the route leading to Narsapur forest area, the path near Ramappa Lake in Warangal, and the 18-kilometre loop around the Kondapochamma Sagar reservoir. “There aren’t many tourist buses on the highways and the rides have been safe so far. For 100 to 200 kilometre rides, we pack sandwiches or parathas from home,” he says.

Fancy a longer drive by car? The Konaseema belt has always been a tourist hotspot. Bhargavi Bijjam, an IT professional and an advocate of eco-conscious living, chose a staycation at Dindi, Konaseema, when she wanted a break from WFH schedule. She wanted to unwind but also not cross paths with too many people. The family drove down to Dindi, packing food and water to ensure they didn’t halt by roadside eateries too often. “The Sarovar Portico resorts hadn’t yet opened their online booking but we took a chance. They were happy to welcome us and we spent time Nature-watching. My friends who saw my Instagram stories asked if I was in Kerala.

361,2020/10/23,Cities need watersheds,"Geohydrologist Lingaraju Yale, as part of an Assocham Webinar event, spoke on how he led his team to revive dried-up rainfed rivers and water bodies, and thus save urban areas. By Ranjani Govind

Any talk of sustainability is incomplete if the elixir of life, water, is not addressed. This is irrespective of whether the place is rural or urban. It is common knowledge and experience that rivers across the country have been running dry a large part of the year even when rainfall is copious; and when they do flow, the contaminants in the water make it unfit for use unless carefully treated. This has adversely impacted rain-dependent cultivation in villages, and urban spaces too, that are dependent on rivers.

Geohydrologist Lingaraju Yale, Director of Art of Living-River Rejuvenation Projects, in a Webinar on “River Rejuvenation – Bringing back to Life India’s dead rivers” spoke of his team’s efforts in rejuvenating 43 dried up rain-fed rivers and water bodies spread across five States. Over the last seven years this team, supported by Art of Living, came up with scientific methods to resuscitate dried waterbodies involving local villagers.

The Webinar was hosted by ASSOCHAM, through its GEM initiative (Green and Eco-friendly Movement- Karnataka Chapter).

Elimination of green cover

The main cause, according to Mr. Yale, for rivers drying up and groundwater getting depleted is the continuous deforestation around rivers and their catchment areas leading to overexploitation of groundwater. According to him, when ecology around the rivers and catchment areas is destroyed, the lack of tree cover results in heavy water runoff along with soil erosion, resulting in not only heavy silting of river beds and streams but also low percolation of water into the ground.

Blending scientific methodologies with traditional, natural techniques and knowledge, Mr. Yale and his team worked to address the core cause of groundwater depletion and drying up of rivers and waterbodies.

“The problem was addressed through afforestation in the catchment areas and along the rivers, desilting of river beds and waterbodies, creating boulder checks to control water flow, and recharging aquifers, along with a host of other techniques”, he elaborated,while giving examples of how they flagged off with the minor river that flows to the north-west of Bengaluru, Kumudavathi, that was completely dry.

Urban water scene

While the rivers serve as the lifeline for both rural and urban areas that get dependent for drinking water, cities are fast running out of water, with borewells turning dry, and groundwater plummeting to unimaginably low levels even as erstwhile lakes and tanks remain only on record. “This is so even when rainfall is more than normal in a year, resulting in flooding of low lying areas, chiefly because of the rainwater failing to percolate into the ground,” says Mr. Yale.

Given this scenario, can a similar innovative solution be prompted to address urban areas too? “The rivers have a broad canvas with a diverse topography. Based on this, multiple watersheds were created and each hydrological boundary was identified based on its use pattern, with an appropriate plan of action initiated for each. In a city like Bengaluru, given its undulating terrain, historically many tanks and lakes were built and they naturally existed too along with lush green environs, permitting water to percolate into the ground. But urbanisation brought encroachments on to the natural streams, not only choking them but also polluting them. The natural flow of water was also obstructed and not much can be done to alter this right away,” states Mr. Yale.

Addressing the peripherals

Yet, in the upcoming urban areas in peripheral Bengaluru, small watersheds can be created in the independent catchments. “We will have to prevent buildings coming up on waterbodies, if need be acquire those that have already come up, set up small individual treatment plants in each watershed to address pollution. In short, the concept of urban watershed management will need to be brought in. We can also create recharge structures in many parks that have come up in the lakebeds or waterbodies, where groundwater can be recharged after treating the water.”

Tackling contamination

Mr. Yale is quick to point that the groundwater recharge through stormwater drains may not happen everywhere as it depends on the ground structure, whether it is rocky or otherwise. He further points out that the main factor plaguing the city is the contaminated water that flows.

“Small watersheds across the city, each with a treatment plant to treat the water before it is being let out, will address this. Currently rainwater harvesting in every household addresses groundwater recharge but when it comes to groundwater recharge across the city, it is imperative to ensure the water is contaminant free as groundwater contamination is very difficult to reverse. Bio-remedies such as enzymes are a good solution to remove contaminants. Blind recharge of groundwater is not correct.”

As for increasing groundwater levels in the urban areas, Mr. Yale opines that it will have to start from the peripheral areas where the catchment areas are identified, watersheds created and groundwater recharge initiated. “This is imperative if the city has to be saved.”

Recharging in natural catchments

As for the disappeared lakes and waterbodies in the city, where two-thirds of Bengaluru was once covered with lakes, tanks and lush greenery, Mr. Yale states that these natural catchments can still be used to initiate groundwater recharge even while retaining the buildings that occupied them.

Emphatically making his point that “planning needs to be done scientifically, not politically,” he says through technology we can identify priority areas as well as places where it is feasible and create micro watersheds in that area. “But undue caution has to be adopted to ensure that water recharging is not contaminated or coming into contact with hazardous waste.”

So, can’t builders and developers adopt waterbodies in their CSR initiative? “That will work, if the government can make it mandatory with a clear plan. The whole exercise will fall in place, provided the right technique and approach are in line,” he adds.

The tragedy of missing water bodies underscores the danger of disregarding nature – this is what the Webinar highlighted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/7yz9zu/article32930138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24bgpRejunevationjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/cities-need-watersheds/article32930121.ece
362,2020/10/23,Design accents and Karunganni pants,"Architect-designer Rooshad Shroff takes his vast catalogue online. Elsewhere, designers, both indie and established, think out of the box — we review Ikai Asai and Maalgaadi’s new e-stores

ikaiasai.com

When Ikai Asai launched at Maison Et Objet, Paris, in January this year, there was no indication of what was to come. Their plans to retail small-batch products that “help consumers rediscover local craftsmanship and the artisanal industry”, as CEO Kanupriya Verma describes it, was put on hold during the lockdown, and revived at London Craft Week last month. The site went live in early October, featuring four collections of tableware, serving utensils and cutlery, made using traditional methods and material.

Verma was part of the team that brought out Ananya Birla’s CuroCarte, a site that curates decor from around the world. With Ikai Asai (which translates to ‘one’ in Punjabi and ‘desire’ in Tamil), the focus was on creating an artisanal lifestyle brand that would help revive crafts that are fast declining. The Deva line, for instance, was drawn from architect Dharmesh Jadeja in collaboration with Longpi pottery artisan Matthew Sasa from Meghalaya. It also features kansa work (bronze), resulting in a gold and black collection of vases, napkin rings, dinner plates and bowls (above).

Designer Rina Singh, founder of Eka, brings her minimalist aesthetic to block-printed table linen and ceramic hand-dyed platters in a range called Lila (seen below). For barware, furniture designer Ayush Kasliwal created Kama, a line made entirely of amethyst. Architect and interior designer Ashiesh Shah worked with Channapatna artist Noor Salma to put together six-foot-tall totem poles that work as art pieces, as well as Junoon tableware with wooden beads.

The site features beautiful product images and a much-appreciated quick view that kicks in when a cursor is scrolled over it (and a single tap if you’re on the mobile site). But overall navigation still remains a bit confusing. If you are looking to browse by collection, head to the ‘Mood’ tab. However, only select items are listed when you try to shop from this page. There are also no options to see all products in a category: customers will have to choose a sub-category — ‘Pitchers’ under ‘Drinkware’ for example — which lessens the chances of us coming across something else we might end up liking and buying.

From ₹350 to ₹2.5 lakh

Up next: Verma promises new collaborations at least twice a year, but is tight-lipped on what crafts we might see on the site next.

From Maalgaadi’s collection

maalgaadistore.com

The eclectic design store tucked away in the bylanes of Besant Nagar might be downing its shutters soon, but its founders are continuing their journey online. With the soft launch last week, the e-store currently lets visitors wishlist their products and will allow orders next week.

Regulars might recall the brand’s earlier site, shop.maalgaadistore.com. Well, co-founder Shahin Ansari explains that it was discontinued a few years ago as they “wanted to focus on the physical space”. Plans to revive the website were always on the cards, but the Covid-19 crisis pushed them to finally get it up. Unlike the former site, which focussed more on home decor than garments, the new fashion-centric digital store will have everything from trench coats and leather sandals to drop pendant chains and Jodhpuri drum bags. Over the years, Ansari has curated shows with an unusual mix of emerging brands from across the country. So we are hopeful. For now, large images greet you on the home page, but we expect photos from multiple angles for a better experience, and a few tweaks to the navigation.

Accessorries at Maalgaadi

“Our focus is on sustainable labels and brands that source ethically. Of the 15 designers featured, eight are ethical labels that focus on handwoven, handspun fabrics,” she says, adding that their curation included picking brands from the existing roster — Mati, Anushe Pirani, Fahd Khatri — and adding new ones. Since the soft launch, they are seeing jewellery, primarily earrings, and Indo-western festive wear being added to buyer wishlists. The site is set to launch on October 28.

₹1,500 onwards for jewellery and ₹2,500 to ₹80,000 for apparel.

Up next: A capsule collection, Earth Pants, that is inspired by the elements of nature. Crafted using Karunganni cotton, a new line of trousers will be launched every month.

A Rooshad Shroff design

rooshadshroff.com

Architect-designer Rooshad Shroff has been toying with the idea of a website for years now. It wasn’t until lockdown gave him the “luxury of time” that he and his team buckled down to the task.

Clean is what comes to mind when you log on. A stunning photograph of one of his projects (a revolving format ensures a new one every time you visit) gives way to a minimal page with just three options — Spaces, Installations, Objects — in crisp black lettering. “I wanted an absolutely fuss-free website, as sterile as possible, so that navigation is easy. There is already a lot of pattern and colour in my work, so, instead of a big graphic design exercise, I wanted the attention to be on the individual piece or project,” he says.

A Rooshad Shroff design

With its grid and list view options, the site is designed like a catalogue. (It is price on request at the moment; for price tags, wait for the Shop feature to go live.) Each entry comes with a detailed write-up, a scroll-through gallery, and an option to download the spec sheet. “The website, launched on October 2, is an introduction to the versatility of our design studio,” he says. “Many people know us only for our furniture or our Hermès windows, and not so much for our architecture projects and events.” More interactive elements like videos would have helped, but Shroff believes “if you repeat the same things from platform to platform, it won’t work”. So making videos and the like will be reserved for his Instagram.

Up next: The Shop will go live soon (right after his physical gallery opens in Mumbai next month).

363,2020/10/23,Rare plants have turned money spinners during the pandemic,"Money does grow on trees after all, find collectors and sellers of rare plants, which are seeing a bloom in popularity — and price — during lockdown

“The market for rare plants used to be like the art market: discreet, rich and a passion nursed by the wealthy. But social media, especially Instagram and Pinterest, changed all that,” says Chennai-based plant collector and nursery owner Maanas Vibhu of Thirteen Degrees North. He adds, “Millennials are now fuelling the demand, especially for foliage and succulents.”

Plants are being sourced from all over the country and also from South Korea, China, Thailand, Myanmar and the Philipines, for Indian buyers. Auctions on social media are where the action takes place with certain plants, like monstera variegated, whose tiny cuttings with few leaves fetch thousands of rupees.

Green with splashes of white, the tropical monstera variegated plant has become the neighbour’s envy and owner’s pride. Lockdown has made this variety of monstera, some kinds of hoya, bonsai of a few ficus and certain other foliage, cacti and succulents more popular than before, says Maanas.

Bulupriya Sharma, a 28-year-old collector and grower in Imphal, says plants that were selling for around ₹2,000 before lockdown, now cost ₹4,000 to ₹5,000. A mature monstera variegated can now sell for more than ₹20,000, she points out, recalling how a friend got her a single node — with one leaf — from Kolkata. “I nurtured it like a baby and now it's three feet tall. I have become more confident and next year, I plan to propagate it for auctions and sales,” says Bulupriya, a.k.a. Bullubi, a popular name among plant parents on Instagram. The star in her extensive collection is the Musa Ae Ae, a banana plant with variegated leaves and fruits that she got from Thailand for approximately ₹7,000.

“I love collecting rare plants from around the world and my collection is driven by my passion for collecting and growing rare breeds at home,” says Bulupriya.

Meziwang Zeliang, a 32-year-old collector from Kohima, is thrilled about how she managed to buy a kind of hoya in September, at a flash sale by a collector in Bengaluru. News of an auction is posted a couple of days before it takes place. Usually, it is a one-day auction within a specific period of time.

Sri Harsha Koppaka from Visakhapatnam also bought a variegated monstera at an auction. “Buyers from all over India participate and there are multiple bids for the same plant,” Harsha says, adding that he, too, conducted a sale and made about ₹15,000 in a day.

“We also exchange plants. For instance, if I come across a photo of a plant on an Instagram account, I get in touch with them and ask if they will exchange it for a plant that I have,” explains 27-year-old Harsha, who has been collecting and growing plants since 2017. He became a collector of plants with variegated leaves after he returned to India from the US in February.

Nangluhomseng Chiring Daosong from Guwahati laughs at how she has been besieged with requests after she posted a photo of her extensive collection on Instagram. Since she lives in Guwahati, she says the climate is ideal for plants from different places in India, Thailand, Myanmar and the Philippines. “However, imported plants can be expensive,” adds Meizi, “So I frequent Dimapur in Nagaland where a local market on Wednesdays has sales of foliage plants; it is much cheaper.”

Adds Maanas, “Olives from Europe and the bonsai versions of certain ficus varieties, can go up to ₹35 lakh to ₹50 lakh. The plants are bought by people who want to make a statement. They don’t sell or propagate them.”

Notes of caution

Thiruvananthapuram-based Rekha Jesudas, former Deputy Director of Agriculture, Kerala, and an ardent gardener herself, points out, “Ideally, importers are supposed to have a quarantine period to ensure that pests or new plant diseases are not introduced into the country. But these rules are not always followed or implemented. Leading importers inform nurseries about new varieties, and most are booked in advance and sold within days of their arrival in the country.

Meziwang Zeliang with some of the plants in her collection | Photo Credit: special arrangement

She says buyers must keep in mind that many of these plants might have been grown in ideal conditions and treated with hormones and chemicals. So newcomers might be disappointed when an expensive plant they bought does not thrive in their care. She advises beginners to start with hardy plants, before going in for trendy varieties.

“In countries like Thailand, nurseries are market savvy and have sophisticated greenhouses and growing methods for plants that are in demand. We in India have a long way to catch up with them,” she adds.

Nurturing their investments

Finance, space and climate are not constraints for plant collectors. If Meizei keeps about 400 to 500 plants in the two balconies of her flat in Kohima, Nangluhomseng Chiring Daosong and Harsha have enough space to nurture their collections. Bulupiya moved from Bengaluru to Imphal and became a full-time collector and plant grower.

“For me collecting rare plants is only one aspect. Growing them takes a lot more work. As they come from various parts of the world they require wide range of soil media, climate and watering cycle. This needs to be precise or else it will impact their health,” he points out.

Collectors are willing to create the climate needed by the plants they invest in. “So if those in dry areas go in for humidifiers, garden enthusiasts in places in Chennai invest in air conditioners and the like” says Nangluhomseng. Owners also install cameras and other measures as precautions against theft. Maanas, for instance, says that the space earmarked for such high-value plants in his nursery are off-bounds for customers without prior appointment.

Harsha and his mother are working on a mini-botanical garden consisting of foliage plants, succulents and carnivorous plants for schoolchildren on their one-acre farm in Visakhapatnam. “I’ve also been implementing in several forms the propagation of these plants. Be it by division, stem cuttings, leaf propagation or macro propagation in case of the variegated banana,” says Harsha.

The green collectors aver that they are not plant flippers — people importing plants only with the intention of selling parts to collectors for money. Says Meizi “We grow plants for the love of them.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/jgwpfo/article32928258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvmbanana,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/rare-plants-turn-money-spinners-during-the-lockdown/article32928263.ece
364,2020/10/23,Style up your sofas,"Teja Lele Desai on seven ways to make your seating arrangements comfortable

In these days when everyone’s under house arrest, the sofa seems to be the mainstay of every living room.

Whatever type it may be — Chesterfield, modular, Lawson-style, sectional, mid-century modern or camelback — this piece of furniture is where you sit, perch, check your phone, chat with friends and family or get your telly fix. If you love your sofa but are kind of bored of the way it looks, may we suggest a few quick ways to jazz it up?

Toss a throw

Throws add casual chic and look perfect when tossed carelessly over the back of a sofa. Opt for a mohair one if you’re seeking warmth or a fur piece to add a touch of Hollywood glam.

Dump the pillows

Almost every other sofa is topped by an assortment of pillows. Stand out from the crowd by placing just one simple cushion — a longish one — on the sofa. Stylish!

Bring in a blanket

What could be better than a warm plaid blanket draped over the side of the sofa? It adds a punch of colour and is just what you need to wrap around yourself on a cold night.

Try a shawl

If the blanket seems a tad too much for Indian winters, why not get out your soft cashmere or pashmina shawl? It adds a stylish touch without focussing too much on the wintry feel.

Change the cushion covers

This one’s a no-brainer but we suggest you keep your throw pillows as they are and spend a couple of hours in the afternoon working on the covers — a satin bow here, some sequins there, a lick of fabric paint somewhere. Voila!

Replace the seat covers

If the sofa seems a bit off colour, why not add a quirky touch by getting the roadside tailor to stitch some slip covers for the seat cushions? Opt for patterns if the sofa is plain, look for solids if the sofa has patterned upholstery.

Explore interesting accessories

Placing planters, a lamp and other souvenirs by the side of the sofa ensures that there’s plenty of visual interest around your seating arrangement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/cxw7oh/article32927464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-883741182,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/style-up-your-sofas/article32927465.ece
365,2020/10/23,How classrooms will change post-Covid,"Schools will need to look at connected spaces, natural ventilation and outdoor learning spots, says Anupama Mohanram

The past few months have made us realise the importance of personal interactions for our children. It is clear that however efficient or effective online education might be, they need to spend a certain amount of time in the company of others. The physical classroom environment promotes and stimulates collaborative learning and brings about the much-needed social interaction with staff and other students.

As we wait for schools and colleges to reopen, what are some of the changes needed in their physical infrastructure to ensure the safety of students and staff?

It is now evident that any new school being constructed should consider the pandemic and ensure that the planning of built spaces will address these conditions going forward. Existing schools will have to look into their current infrastructure and make appropriate adjustments.

A key lesson learnt from COVID-19 is that mechanical conditioning of indoor spaces is not ideal for occupants. Naturally ventilated and sun-lit spaces are healthier — they not only help prevent the spread of any infection, but also aid in faster healing. Spaces such as classrooms — where students and staff spend a lot of time — need to ensure adequate access to breeze and light. Personal space is another important factor to be considered to ensure the maintenance of social distancing without too many changes.

Existing schools could look into opening out closed classrooms to cater to the above two requirements. Windows could be made larger, additional doorways could be opened out to ensure easy access to the outdoors. Creating ‘verandah’ like spaces — that expand the classroom and allow for distancing and spillover of students so they do not feel trapped inside — is another option.

Kindergarten and/or primary classrooms could be opened out to connect two classrooms via an open archway that can be closed if needed by blinds. Installation of insulation on the rooftops could be planned to ensure indoor spaces remain cool and comfortable without the need for mechanical air conditioning.

Spaces could also be created for outdoor learning in smaller groups. Built-in brick and stone seating around or near trees and stepped seating can be created to add more interest. Such spaces can alternatively be used for events and meetings.

Sanitisation stations should be installed at entry points and must be equipped with adequate handwash facilities with separators to prevent crowding. A variety of innovative roof-covered structures and unique signages could be incorporated to make these zones interesting for children.

Opening out indoor spaces and creating flexible transitions will not only ensure schools are better prepared to deal with such pandemics in the future, but will also create a healthy environment for children to spend time in.

369,2020/10/23,"With appointment of SEC, Puducherry will have local body polls soon: L-G","‘The U.T. will be eligible to get more Central funds with self-governance in place’

Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi on Thursday said with the appointment of State Election Commissioner, the Union Territory would soon have panchayat elections.

In a message to the media, she said the Union Territory would soon have grassroot democracy.

“In 2018, the Supreme Court directed the government to hold election within four months and sternly warned that no delay can be brooked. The government was committing contempt of court by not holding elections. Vested interests did not want civic body elections to be held and hence cast all obstacles,”’ she said.

10 years since last poll

Stating that the last local body election was held 10 years ago, she said with local self governance in place the Union Territory would be eligible to get more Central funds.

“Puducherry is gradually transitioning towards self governance more now with panchayat elections. More funds will come from the Government of India. Funds were not coming since we did not have elected bodies,” the Lieutenant Governor said.

The elections would be an opportunity for true social workers and activists who want to see change and transformation, she said.

370,2020/10/23,SEC appointment is illegal: Narayanasamy,"‘Govt. yet to complete legal process in challenging L-G’s move’

Terming the appointment of retired IFS officer Roy P. Thomas as the State Election Commissioner to be “illegal,” Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Thursday said the government has not yet completed the legal process in challenging the initiative taken by the Lt. Governor in the appointment process of the SEC.

“We are in the process of challenging the High Court order in the Supreme Court. Because of COVID-19, the process got delayed,” Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy told The Hindu.

The Madras High Court had dismissed a writ petition filed by Minister for Local Administration A. Namassivayam challenging the Lieutenant Governor’s decision to reject the nominee of the Cabinet for the SEC post.

The court upheld the decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Lt. Governor to call for advertisements. Mr. Narayanasamy said when the file for Mr. Thomas’s appointment came to his office, he had questioned the decision.

“The appointment was based on a notification which was annulled by the Legislative Assembly. How could the appointment be made on the basis of a notification quashed by the Speaker. I wanted the Legal Department to examine the issue but my concerns were completely ignored.

372,2020/10/23,Amendments to building permit order not cleared,"Opposition councillors seek more clarity on IDO changes

A meeting of the city Corporation council on Friday failed to clear the long delayed amendments to the Interim Development Order (IDO), which governs the awarding of building permits and all kinds of land use in the city in the absence of a sanctioned master plan, as the Opposition councillors demanded more clarity on the same. Mayor K. Sreekumar set aside the agenda after a lengthy discussion. Now it is expected to be taken up in the last remaining council meeting before the local body elections.

The proposed amendments are beneficial to those who had trouble getting building permits as their land was wrongly marked as paddy field or meant for public use. Councillors of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) initially questioned the ruling front for the delay in issuing a draft master plan.

On master plan

Town Planning Committee Chairman Palayam Rajan said that the civic body had organised consultations in all wards and with people from various sectors, to consider their concerns and to avoid the protests the previous draft master plan had to face. The COVID-19 pandemic had affected some of these processes. The draft master plan can now be tabled only in the next council’s tenure as further consultations are needed, he said.

An agenda regarding the expenses incurred for the Aksharasree project of the Kerala State Literacy Mission also led to a heated debate in the council, with BJP councillors raising doubts about spendings under the mission. The LDF councillors hit back accusing the BJP of not valuing the important work done by the mission at the grassroot level in improving literacy levels. Education Standing Committee Chairman C. Sudharshanan read out the detailed expenses under each head, including the expenses on the co-ordinators and instructors for each ward.

The agenda was later passed.

Contract workers

The city Corporation also recommended to the State government to give contingent worker status to contract workers who have been working on daily wages for the local body for years. Those who have been working with the civic body for more than one or two decades are being considered for the status. The BJP had raised objections, but the UDF supported the agenda due to humanitarian considerations.

At the end of an uncharacteristically peaceful council meeting, when all the agenda items were taken up ahead of the cut-off time, the Mayor complimented the Opposition for their co-operation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/amendments-to-building-permit-order-not-cleared/article32931981.ece
373,2020/10/23,Elephant centre to receive visitors from today,"Strict restrictions in place as Kottoor centre opens after seven months

On Saturday, the Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at Kottoor will welcome visitors after a gap of seven months. The Forest Department has laid down guidelines to streamline entry to the premises that house 15 elephants rescued from various parts of the State.

The State-run facility has been nurturing elephants of various age groups, ranging from the one-year-old Sreekutty, rescued from the Ambanad estate in Kollam last year, to the 78-year old ‘retired’ elephant Soman, the oldest captive elephant in the State.

The centre has remained closed since March when the COVID-19-induced lockdown had come into effect. The authorities stepped up surveillance after news emerged of several animals testing positive for the infection in the Bronx Zoo in New York.

Guidelines

According to Agasthyavanam Biological Park deputy warden N.V. Satheesan, entry will be permitted from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. for all people except children aged below 10 years. Groups should not exceed five people.

Visitors will not be permitted to touch the elephants. Only a maximum of 20 people will be allowed to come in close proximity with the four elephant enclosures at the same time. With visits being restricted to two hours for each visitor, only 50 visitors will be allowed to enter the centre at a time, Mr. Satheesan said .

Not all services will resume from the first day. While bamboo rafting will remain suspended, visitors can go on the 3-km trek to Kizhakkumalappara, the official said.

The reopening will bring much succour to the members of the eco-development committee (EDC) who guide visitors through the premises and man the canteen. The 24 employees will work in shifts as batches of 12 for 15 days a month. They were being paid wages for 10 days during the lockdown period when they could not report for work.

The centre was teeming with visitors during the pre-lockdown period. It generally attracted tourists who would also drop by the deer rehabilitation centre and the crocodile park under the Neyyar wildlife sanctuary before concluding leisure trips.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/knfoj6/article32933504.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24TVELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/elephant-centre-to-receive-visitors-from-today/article32931951.ece
374,2020/10/23,Ponmudi lower sanatorium gets a facelift,"Children’s park, landscaping, resting places, parking facilities

The lower sanatorium at Ponmudi has been given a facelift by Kerala Tourism at a cost of ₹2.08 crore as part of converting the idyllic hill station into a world-class tourist destination.

Children’s park, landscaping, resting places, and parking facilities even for buses had been created as part of improving the infrastructure and beautifying the lower sanatorium where the visitors first land at Ponmudi.

The project was among the 26 kicked off by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in 14 districts on Thursday through videoconferencing. Minister for Tourism Kadakampally Surendran, who presided, said the sector was able to record the highest revenue during the last four years. Local legislator D. Murali welcomed the gathering. The beautification is part of the ₹200-crore project for the development of Ponmudi with the assistance of Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board.

₹25,000-cr. loss

Kerala Tourism has suffered a loss of ₹25,000 crore owing to the pandemic-induced lockdown and job loss of hundreds employed by travel trade, Mr. Vijayan said while inaugurating the projects.

The Chief Minister said the pandemic struck Kerala when the tourism sector was marching ahead overcoming several crises and natural disasters. The new tourism projects being launched were aimed at giving a fillip to the sector and increase footfall. “Kerala will bounce back,” Mr. Vijayan said.

The projects were being executed in such a way that the ecology remained undisturbed, Mr. Surendran said.

376,2020/10/23,Plea for minor bridge across canal,"Residents of newly-added wards of the Tiruchi City Corporation have sought the construction of a minor bridge across the Kuvalai drain which separates Balaji Nagar and SAS Nagar, New Town near Kattur. They have resorted to taking a detour, along the accident-prone Thanjavur Road where there is no service lane, they say.

Balaji Nagar and SAS Nagar, New Town in ward number 63 of the Tiruchi City Corporation are divided by the Kuvalai drain, which branches off from the Uyyakondan canal. With the busy Thanjavur highway running on one side, the residents are unable to commute between the two localities, they say.

Four years ago, women in the locality took the initiative to mobilise funds to construct a pedestrian bridge across the canal. About ₹50,000 was collected and with it, large pipes, to ensure that the flow of water is unrestricted, were laid after which a concrete pedestrian pathway was constructed.

The minor bridge, if constructed would help two-wheelers and auto-rickshaws avoid the congested Thanjavur road. “This is mainly for people on SAS Nagar, Muthu Nagar side who travel up to the Kuvalai drain, walk across the pedestrian bridge to drop their children off to school in Balaji Nagar. At least 100 children from the nearly 1000 houses in the area go to school in Balaji Nagar,” A. Gunashekar, a resident of SAS Nagar said. Others ride on the wrong side of the road along the Tiruchi- Thanjavur road since there is no service lane. ""Many accidents involving senior citizens and children have occurred and even then, the authorities have paid no heed,"" he said.

Representations have been submitted to the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Tiruverumbur MLA Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi by the New Town, Muthu Nagar, Vaithiyalingam Nagar, Roshan Nagar Integrated Residents Welfare Association.

A senior PWD official said that they were willing to give a no-objection certificate and have drawn up an estimate for construction of the bridge. ‘The residents said that they would make arrangements for the funds and we are awaiting its approval to begin work,’ he said.

A proposal at an estimate of ₹49 lakhs has been prepared, while the residents have approached the Tiruverumbur MLA and the Tiruchi Collector for assistance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/canal/article32931669.ece
377,2020/10/23,Many seats remain vacant in govt. polytechnic colleges,"In variation of the usual trend of fixing stiff cut-off for admission, Government Polytechnic colleges are evidently welcoming even below average students with open arms this year, apparently due to severe dent in the intake caused by introduction of online system of admission in view of COVID-19 pandemic

As much as 50 % seats are yet to be filled in at least half of the 54 government polytechnic colleges in the State, even after the extension of date of admission till October 31, according to sources.

A week ago, government polytechnic colleges came out with an announcement stating that students with SSLC qualification will be admitted till October 31 in the offline mode.

For instance, nearly 100 seats remained vacant till last week in the Government Polytechnic College at Keezhapazhur in Ariyalur district. Though the yearly fee is just ₹ 2,500 a year and students are entitled to free laptops, free bus pass, scholarships and other freebies from the government, students could not be found since the online admission process turned out to be a deterrent.

Private polytechnic colleges were at a considerable advantage this time around, as they could reach out to the students at their doorsteps. The plight of government-aided polytechnics was slightly better.

A front-ranking polytechnic in Tiruchi district, managed to fill the seats, the number of applicants was much lower this year due to the introduction of online system for admission during the months of stringent lockdown, sources said.

The number of applicants in the Government Polytechnic Tiruchi was reportedly quite dismal this year, as rural students who usually seek admission in the institution found the going tough to comply with the requirements of online system of admission.

Completion of the admission process for Plus One in advance was another reason for the fall in number of applicants in government polytechnics, a Principal of a polytechnic college in a rural district in the region, said. The momentum of academic rigour in polytechnics is bound to slow down this year, another principal said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/college/article32931496.ece

380,2020/10/23,Land acquisition for by-pass project opposed,"Farmers of Thiruvaiyaru taluk registered their protest against the acquisition of fertile lands for the proposed Thiruvaiyaru By-pass Road project by walking out from the virtual agriculture meeting held at Thiruvaiyaru on Friday.

The virtual meet was chaired by the Collector, M.Govinda Rao through online from the District Collectorate at Thanjavur and farmers participated in the AGM from the office of the Assistant Agriculture Officers and at the Block Development Offices in the district.

When the meeting commenced, farmers at Thiruvaiyaru walked out from the meeting hall demanding that the land acquisition process be shelved immediately since the proposed by-pass road passes through fertile agriculture lands. Later they attended the meeting where they made oral representation to the officials in support of their demand.

At Kumbakonam, Sundara Vimalanathan, secretary, Thajavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association demanded an enhanced price for paddy and sugarcane in Tamil Nadu. He said that ₹2795 per quintal was provided to paddy at Kerala and ₹2500 per quintal of paddy at Chattishgarh. For sugarcane the Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra governments were providing ₹3500 per quintal, he added.

Participating in the virtual AGM at Budalur, V.Jeevakumar, State Deputy President, Tamilnadu Vivasaya Thozhilalargal Sangam, urged the government to create a storage facility for onions at Valakudi in Budalur block since a large number of farmers have taken up onion cultivation.

At Thanjavur, Govindaraj, a sugarcane cultivator, requested the officials to initiate steps for extending the Mayanur Mettukattali Canal which brings water to Kurumpoondi lake up to Mudalaimuthu lake.

Chairing the meeting at the Collectorate, the Collector said that efforts have been initiated to improve 2000 hectares in rain-fed areas in the district under the Tamil Nadu Mission on Sustainable Dryland Agriculture scheme implemented by the Agriculture Engineering Department. Further, it had also been proposed to encourage black gram and sesame cultivation in about 120 hectares in 12 circles during rabi season under the National Agriculture Development Project, he added.

383,2020/10/23,The Common Dotted Garden Skink is a ground runner,"The Common Dotted Garden Skink, also known as saamp ki mausi (the snake’s aunt), is harmless and beautiful

In 2014, when I had just started exploring nature and wildlife, I was still mostly oblivious to the wonderful creatures around me. One such experience made me look at my concrete colony in a completely different and positive light. In a sense I owe my career to the female Shikra (a predatory hawk) that frequented the trees around my house.

I would spend hours in the park, sometimes even taking my lunch there so as not to miss an important moment. One pleasant April day, I found the Shikra happily perched on the Champa tree my grandmother had planted in my wee years of childhood. To my excitement, the bird had in its talons, a small worm-like animal. I captured the sight on my camera, and when I processed the images, I was surprise to find it was a scaly creature the Shikra had captured.

I decided to explore what the mysterious prey could be, and a day later narrowed it down to the Common Dotted Garden Skink (Lygosoma punctata). Over the next few days, I started seeing one every day. I didn’t think our urban gardens could have other lizards apart from the regular girgit (Oriental Garden Lizard) or the usual House Gecko found even in our high-rise apartments, often feasting on insects.

Skinks are often referred to as saamp ki mausi in Hindi, mostly dwelling on the ground. This species is quite a widespread species of skink found in the Indian Subcontinent. Skinks are lizards that belong to the family Scincidae, one of the most diverse families of lizards with over 1,500 species described.

The Common Dotted Garden Skink is smooth and iridescent and does have a snout, like other lizards. It can grow up to 85 mm with a very snake-like in appearance with short toes.

On being intimidated, it moves away very swiftly on the ground usually to hide in the undergrowth or in a nearby crevice. Getting a glimpse is difficult, so listen for a rustling sound as it darts across fallen leaves. You’ll find it under rocks, potted plants, in crevices and underground in the park.

The upperpart of an adult is brown, while a juvenile has a red tail, which turns brown and develops spots as it matures into adulthood. The underpart is yellowish-white.

There is somewhat of a mystery about its general behaviour but what we do know is that like most other small lizards, it is an insectivore and oviparous (lays eggs that mature and hatch after being expelled from the body). Being a reptile, it is more commonly seen in warmer seasons, especially in the rains, when their regular hideouts are flooded with water. At the onset on winter, these cold-blooded animals that need the sun for energy, will come out to bask in spots of sunlight, like on rocks and barks.

Skinks and other lizards are beneficial for our gardens. They are natural pest-controllers that feed on insects which could potentially harm our plants. Let’s respect them for who they are: magnificent colourful reptiles that do a service to humankind.

384,2020/10/23,NGT upholds inhabitants’ right to clean environment,"It was hearing a plea filed by SSF Polymers Ltd seeking review of the NGT order directing the SPCB to take action against the unit for causing pollution.

The National Green Tribunal has junked a plea by a Haryana-based industrial unit seeking review of an order directing the State Pollution Control Board to shut it down for causing air pollution, and said the right of inhabitants to a clean environment cannot be defeated.

A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the unit was functioning in violation of consent conditions and parameters of air quality as found by an expert committee.

The green panel refused to agree with the industrial unit’s submission that permission given to it was for 10 years, not from July 30, 2008 but from the date of setting up in 2012, and to this extent there is an error in the order.

“Thus, right to continue for 10 years being not unconditional and absolute cannot be asserted. The right of the inhabitants to clean environment cannot be defeated on this plea. Thus, even if it is to be accepted that permission of 10 years from the date of establishment which is still not over, we do not find any merit in the review application,” the Bench said. However, the applicant unit is at liberty to approach the pollution control board for seeking time for shifting. This may be considered by the State Pollution Control Board on its own merits, it said.

The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by SSF Polymers Ltd seeking review of the NGT order dated September 29 directing the State Pollution Control Board to take action against the unit for causing pollution.

385,2020/10/23,Coronavirus | Government plans special immunisation programme for COVID-19 vaccine,"Official sources said, “The Centre will procure the vaccine directly to make it available to the priority groups free-of-charge through the existing network of States and districts.”

The coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, once available, will be distributed under a special COVID-19 immunisation programme with the Centre procuring the doses directly and making it available for priority groups, official sources said.

According to them, the Centre will procure the vaccine directly to make it available to the priority groups free-of-charge through the existing network of States and districts. States have been asked not to chart separate pathways of procurement, they said.

The Centre, with the help of State and Union Territory governments, has started the process of identifying around 30 crore priority beneficiaries who would be given vaccine dose in the initial phase. This special COVID-19 immunisation programme would run in parallel with the Universal Immunisation Programme, but will use its processes, technology and network of the existing vaccine distribution framework, sources said.

The government has demarcated four categories of people for vaccination in the initial phase - around one crore healthcare professionals including doctors, MBBS students, nurses and ASHA workers, etc.; around two crore frontline workers including municipal corporation workers, personnel of the police and armed forces; about 26 crore people aged above 50; and a special group of those below 50 years of age with co-morbidities and requiring specialised care.

“States have been asked to enlist by mid-November the priority population groups.... Each person in the immunisation list will be linked with their Aadhaar cards so as to track them,” a source said.

The existing digital platform and processes used for the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) are being enhanced to track COVID-19 vaccine administration and movement - from procurement to storage to distribution to individual beneficiaries - as and when the vaccine becomes available, Health Ministry officials have said.

Also, online training modules are being developed for vaccinators. The digital platform that is being enhanced is Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN), which provides real-time information on vaccine stocks and storage temperatures across all cold chain points in the country under UIP.

Under UIP, children, adolescents and pregnant women are currently vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases free-of-charge by the State.

The National Expert Committee on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 has already mapped the existing cold chain being utilised under the government’s immunisation programme and has also made a projection of the additional requirement, Health Ministry officials had said earlier.

Presently, the Committee is engaged in mapping private sector facilities that could serve the needs of supplementing the cold chain equipment.

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has said that the Centre estimates to receive and utilise 40-50 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine covering around 25 crore people by July next year.

Mr. Vardhan had said the government is working round-the-clock to ensure that there is a fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, once they are ready.

The biggest benefit that India has is that it has a robust immunisation programme in place and it is implementing the largest immunisation programme of the world, with nearly 27 million newborns targeted for immunisation annually, the Minister said.

“We have an established infrastructure for supply, storage and delivery of vaccines to the last mile, under our Universal Immunisation Programme, where we are administering around 600 million doses to children every year,” he said.

“The strength of these experiences in the vaccination landscape, our best practices and the robustness of our health delivery system will be leveraged and augmented using a strong IT backbone to ensure that this humongous national mission of vaccinating the identified priority groups with COVID-19 vaccine is achieved in a timely manner. The Indian government will leverage the integrated IT platform eVIN for managing vaccine distribution,” Mr. Vardhan said.

Mr. Vardhan re-affirmed the commitment of the Indian government and assured that it has accorded top most priority to the research and manufacturing to ensure that the vaccine reaches to the last person.

386,2020/10/23,Coronavirus | ICMR issues advisory for use of Feluda paper strip test,"It said that no further RT-PCR based confirmation is required for samples that are confirmed as positive or negative by the CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 test.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has issued an advisory for the use of indigenously developed Feluda paper strip test, which is based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, by laboratories.

The paper-strip uses cutting-edge CRISPR gene-editing technology to identify and target the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in less than an hour.

As claimed by the manufacturer, no further RT-PCR based confirmation is required for samples that are confirmed as positive or negative by the CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 test, the advisory issued on Thursday stated.

The test has been developed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s (CSIRs) Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi, and has been validated by the National Centre for Biological Sciences and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.

The test has been approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for use in the country.

“The test works by identifying SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and uses a Thermal Cycler instead of a qPCR machine for conducting the test. As claimed by the manufacturer, no further RT-PCR based confirmation is required for samples that are confirmed as positive or negative by the CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 test,” the ICMR said in its advisory.

Existing government or private laboratories already approved by the ICMR for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR based testing may use this new CRISPR test if the laboratory desires to do so.

No further approval is required from the ICMR for existing laboratories.

New laboratories intending to initiate molecular testing of SARS-CoV-2 testing by any method will be required to seek approval as per the standard process laid down by the ICMR and NABL before initiating any kind of molecular testing, the advisory said.

Any prescription for RT-PCR, CRISPR, TRUENAT, CBNAAT may be considered equivalent.

All testing data should be essentially entered into the ICMR COVID-19 web portal on a real time basis.

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had recently said that based on tests in over 2,000 patients during the trials at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) and testing in private labs, the tests showed 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity.

This compares favourably to ICMR’s current acceptation criteria of RT-PCR kit of at least 95% sensitivity and at least 99% specificity, he had stated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x3vowi/article32816058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-icmr-issues-advisory-for-use-of-feluda-paper-strip-test/article32925981.ece
387,2020/10/23,Coronavirus | U.S. gives full approval to antiviral remdesivir to treat COVID-19,"The drug was first developed to treat Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday granted full approval to the antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, after conditional authorization was given in May.

Gilead said the drug, sold under the brand name Veklury, was the only specific treatment for COVID-19 approved so far under a more rigorous process.

However, other treatments have received authorization for emergency use, though that approval can be revoked once the public health emergency sparked by the coronavirus pandemic is over.

Other medications, like the steroid dexamethasone, are also being used in the fight against Covid-19.

Gilead's shares on the New York Stock Exchange jumped four percent soon after the announcement.

“The FDA is committed to expediting the development and availability of COVID-19 treatments during this unprecedented public health emergency,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn.

“Today's approval is supported by data from multiple clinical trials that the agency has rigorously assessed and represents an important scientific milestone in the Covid-19 pandemic.”

Europe and other countries such as Canada also have granted temporary approval for the use of remdesivir.

Remdesivir, which is administered by an injection, was one of the first drugs to show relative promise in shortening the time to recovery in some coronavirus patients.

But its efficacy in reducing the mortality rate is unproven.

It can be administered to adults and children over the age of 12 who weigh more than 40 kilos (88 pounds) who require hospitalization for the treatment of Covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

The drug can only be given to patients in a hospital or equivalent setting.

Emergency approval has been granted for its use on pediatric patients under the age of 12 weighing at least 3.5 kilos.

President Donald Trump, who tested positive for the coronavirus early in October, was treated with remdesivir at a military hospital outside Washington, among other drugs.

Faster recovery time

The drug was first developed to treat Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever.

In February, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced it was dusting off remdesivir to investigate against SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19, because it had shown promise in animal testing against fellow coronaviruses SARS and MERS.

Its study involving more than 1,000 people, the results of which were released in April, found that patients on the drug had a 31 percent faster time to recovery than those on a placebo.

Since the medicine is complex to manufacture and is administered via injection, rather than a pill, there have been questions about whether supply could initially be limited.

The United States bet early on remdesivir's success, rushing to preorder nearly all of Gilead's summer production.

Gilead has set the price at $390 per vial in developed countries, or $2,340 for six vials used over the normal five-day course, though US private insurers will pay $520 per vial.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/liy4u0/article32189982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25JULTH--REMDESVIR,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-us-gives-full-approval-to-antiviral-remdesivir-to-treat-covid-19/article32924346.ece
388,2020/10/23,We’re learning from the shortcomings of the first Green Revolution: academic Shailaja Fennell,"New research at University of Cambridge focuses on rural knowledge systems and sustainable practices to safeguard the ecosystem

An academic with research interests in food production, rural development and gender equality in development interventions, Shailaja Fennell has worked on several international projects to promote sustainability and build resilience. She supervises M.Phil students at the Centre of Development Studies – University of Cambridge, and Ph.D students at the Centre of Development Studies and the Department of Land Economy. Currently engaged in a research programme to study how to improve crop productivity and water use, and identify farming practices for sustainable rural development, Dr. Fennell talks about institutional change and using indigenous knowledge systems to build long-term resilience in our ecosystems. Excerpts:

In the context of heat waves and water shortage that the Indian subcontinent is facing, how does the research at Centre for Development Studies – University of Cambridge address this predicament to build resilience?

Climate change is a reality we need to collectively address across the planet. Based at the Department of Land Economy and Centre of Development Studies, my research has focussed on institutional change to bring about sustainability solutions. The emphasis is on building resilience through participation and empowerment. A core aspect of such an inclusion is bringing households and communities into the development process.

The research examines water-saving crops, alternative sources of energy and new opportunities in livelihood and education to remote rural communities. It is a more holistic notion of resilience and self-reliance.

Given the various speculative scenarios for the future, and the mirage of urban utopias driven by technology, how does your research address the complexity of neglected rural hinterlands?

Until now, a large part of the development agenda around the world has tended to focus on cities.

In contrast, the work being undertaken across faculties of biological, physical and social sciences shifts the focus towards recognising that sustainability is more important for rural communities, that are often far away from these urban growth centres.

These communities are considerably disadvantaged in their access to education and health and other basic services. They are also finding it increasingly difficult to ensure adequate livelihoods through farming activities. Hence, our focus is on cross-disciplinary research, that can bring new thinking to improve the food-water-energy ecosystem, in rural and peri-urban areas. This ensures that rural communities can access new services and skills. They co-create avenues to empower youth through new diversified forms of employment, besides farming.

The first Green Revolution focused largely on water intensive crops like rice and wheat. In the present context, what new learning does the research bring?

The work at the University of Cambridge addresses many links in the complex web of issues to which you are referring. Drawing together a formidable network of partners from research, industry, government and NGOs in the U.K. and India, the project aims to define requirements for a second, more sustainable, Green Revolution in India. A suite of co-created research areas, with training workshops and education activities have been formulated as part of this capacity building programme.

It includes fundamental research addressing crop productivity and water use in India. It will identify appropriate crops and farming practices for different climatic regions. In the context of climate change and depletion of groundwater sources, the idea is to rebuild resilience through conserving water resources and evolving new energy paradigms.

How would this paradigm shift empower rural hinterlands that have less rainfall?

This project provides an excellent opportunity to generate innovative solutions to move away from previous intensive agriculture strategies. These had focused exclusively on increasing yields of wheat-paddy (highly water-intensive) annual crop cycles.

In contrast, this project is working on learning from the shortcomings of the first Green Revolution, where the system of agricultural production led to pressure on our limited water resources, depletion of groundwater and nutrient balance. The questions we asked were “how can we conserve water resources and yet ensure sustainable agricultural processes?”

The project examines a shift to cultivation of a range of millets in semi-arid regions: pearl millet, foxtail millet, little millets as well as sorghum (the terms in Tamil are kambu, thinai, samai and cholam). This could result in a less water-intensive, and more heat-resistance system of agricultural cultivation.

What are the implications for urban areas of this shift from wheat-rice to millets?

These crops (range of millets) have several additional benefits. They are better for human nutrition as they have a lower glycemic index than rice and wheat. A new awareness on urban nutrition could substantially enable control of diabetes, obesity and several other ailments, which are on the rise in urban areas.

The conventional food-water-energy ecosystem is based on outdated notions that water and energy are unlimited resources. How can this perception and practice change?

It is crucial that we break out of our silos and increasingly engage in multi-disciplinary research. Interdisciplinary research centres bring together cutting-edge approaches to understanding the food-water-energy ecosystem that is at the core of sustainable development.

If India’s quest to create Smart Cities is linked to its own indigenous concept of Smart Villages, rural economies, increasingly, will become more sustainable. They will become a continuum from village to local town, to city.

The concept of a Smart Village focuses on access to renewable energy as a catalyst for sustainable growth. This builds its resilience and it is not subject to the vagaries of power outages.

Simultaneously, rural hinterlands could diversify from wheat-rice production to more nutritive millet production. This would save valuable water resources as well. There are organisations in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere in India that have generated several local solutions to promote the consumption of millets. Such initiatives would economically support non-agricultural income generating activities. For instance, youth are now involved in setting up decentralised renewable energy through construction of mini and nano-grid systems. This could reduce the burden on state electricity boards in the long term. This is the paradigm shift that is possible.

How would this impact education and employment in rural hinterlands?

Life on the farm is no longer regarded as a preferred form of employment. The youth are looking to other sources of employment. This situation can be remedied by providing a diverse set of opportunities for education and employment: this would allow the current policies of the Indian government such as Smart Cities to go beyond a singular emphasis on technological features of provision of infrastructure — by focussing on skill development training and developing agro-processing, storage and warehousing provision of piped water supply, and the introduction of solid and liquid waste management.

It can enhance the ability to better operate mobile health units, to ensure village road connectivity, better access to LPG gas connections and electronic delivery of citizen centric services.

Emphasising the ‘indigenous smartness’ of a rural community is of fundamental significance for bringing about paradigm shifts in other spheres of development policy as well. Traditional knowledge can change our approach to housing. We begin with the notion of participation of residents in the design and implementation of a housing programme.

The complex web of inter-related issues, based on indigenous rural knowledge systems and facilitated by access to new technological solutions, can build long-term resilience in our ecosystems. We need new paradigms of rural education that provide opportunities for entrepreneurship and income-generation. These strategies need to address the problems of water scarcity and heat waves induced by climate change. They have to be locally appropriate too. Only then can they be truly sustainable.
