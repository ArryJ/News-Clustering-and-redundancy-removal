0,2020/10/07,Nadal passes Sinner test to storm into French Open semi-finals,"The Spaniard, also looking to match Roger Federer's record of 20 Grand Slam men's singles titles, was stretched by the 19-year-old Sinner as he set up a clash with Argentine Diego Schwartzman, who beat him in the Italian Open quarter-finals last month.

Claycourt master Rafael Nadal passed his first real test of this year's French Open with a 7-6(4) 6-4 6-1 victory against Italian rising star Jannik Sinner as his quest for a record-breaking 13th title gathered momentum on Tuesday.

The Spaniard, also looking to match Roger Federer's record of 20 Grand Slam men's singles titles, was stretched by the 19-year-old Sinner as he set up a clash with Argentine Diego Schwartzman, who beat him in the Italian Open quarter-finals last month.

The 34-year-old Nadal's 97 previous victories at Roland Garros made the difference in key moments with the Spaniard rallying from a break down in the first two sets.

Sinner, the first French Open debutant to reach the last eight since Nadal in 2005, confirmed his immense potential but lacked just a bit of composure when it mattered.

“Sinner is a very, very young talent with a lot of power, great shots. For two sets it was tough, especially in the second set I was lucky to be back,” said Nadal after a match played in cold conditions that ended at 0126 local time, the latest finish at a French Open.

“The conditions were a little bit difficult, he was hitting every ball very hard and with this cold, my speed is not there. It was hard for me to put him out of position.

“Now I have two, well almost one and a half days off to rest and practice.”

South Tyrolian Sinner hit powerful groundstrokes, putting Nadal on the backfoot in many rallies on court Philippe Chatrier, only for the Mallorcan to unlock his own massive forehand to turn the tide.

Big hits

The big-hitting Sinner had the first break point, in the fifth game, but the Italian made an unforced error.

Nadal went into the contest having won 48 of his 50 service games but he was in trouble again at 5-5 when Sinner set up two break points.

He staved off the first with a forehand winner, and the second when Sinner's return of an ill-timed drop shot by the Spaniard flew long. From deuce, Sinner created another break chance, which was converted when Nadal's forehand went wide.

Nadal had his first break points in the following game and he converted the third with a stunning forehand winner down the line.

The Spaniard was more consistent in the tiebreak as he moved one set up.

Sinner, who was three when Nadal first lifted the Coupe des Mousquetaires, took time out to have his right abductor muscle massaged. He then came back on court with all guns blazing, breaking for 3-1.

Nadal broke back immediately as Sinner showed his first signs of frustration and the Spaniard broke again in the ninth game before wrapping the set on serve, having significantly raised his game.

Sinner, winner of last year's ATP NextGen Finals, then hit a wall and despite the Italian's best efforts and energy, Nadal moved 4-0 up and did not release his grip, ending it with an overhead smash.

“From now on it's just head down and trying to improve, trying to play hours after hours on court, which I need to do,” said Sinner in a blunt self-assessment.

“He took his chances, I didn't take mine. I need to improve mentally, obviously.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/sxmwd3/article32788242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDNADAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/nadal-passes-sinner-test-to-storm-into-french-open-semi-finals/article32788243.ece
1,2020/10/07,French Open | Schwartzman gets past Thiem in five-hour battle to reach semis,"Schwartzman had never beaten a top-five player at a Grand Slam and had lost his three previous quarter-finals but he produced a relentless display to set that record straight.

Argentina's Diego Schwartzman outlasted Dominic Thiem in a brutal claycourt war of attrition to win 7-6(1) 5-7 6-7(6) 7-6(5) 6-2 and reach his first French Open semi-final on Tuesday.

Schwartzman had never beaten a top-five player at a Grand Slam and had lost his three previous quarter-finals but he produced a relentless display to set that record straight.

Both players appeared to be running on empty at times as they slugged out endless rallies from the baseline for more than five hours on a windy Court Phillipe Chatrier.

Third seed Thiem, the U.S Open champion, saved a set point in the third before moving two sets to one ahead and when Schwartzman wasted three set points at 5-4 in the fourth it looked as though he was going to fall short.

But the 12th seed showed incredible resilience to come back from 3-1 down in the tiebreak to drag it into a final set.

Schwartzman looked the fresher player in the decider and Thiem, bidding to reach a fifth successive French Open semi-final, began to unravel.

The Argentine sensed his moment and forged a break ahead before claiming victory as Thiem dumped a weary-looking drop shot into the net on match point.

Schwartzman will face either 12-time champion Rafa Nadal, who he beat in the recent Rome tournament, or Italian teenager Jannick Sinner in the last four.

Second seed Nadal's clash with Sinner was still to be played after a women's quarter-final on Tuesday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/dd8fie/article32787927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEIGOKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/french-open-schwartzman-gets-past-thiem-in-five-hour-battle-to-reach-semis/article32787928.ece
2,2020/10/07,Polish teenager Swiatek powers into French Open semis,"Iga Swuatek beat Italian qualifier Martina Trevisan 6-3 6-1

Polish teenager Iga Swiatek recovered from a nervy start to outclass Italian qualifier Martina Trevisan 6-3 6-1 and move into the French Open semi-finals on Tuesday.

The 19-year-old, who thrashed Romania's top seed Simona Halep on Sunday to reach her first Grand Slam quarter-final, looked tight as she trailed 3-1 after a long wait to get on court but then took charge with some aggressive hitting.

She is the first Polish woman to reach the French Open semi-finals since Jadwiga Jedrzejowska was runner-up in 1939.

Former Wimbledon junior champion Swiatek won eight games in a row to move within three games of victory before tricky left-hander Trevisan stopped the rot with a break of serve.

However, a crushing forehand winner by Swiatek in the following game resumed the onslaught and she romped to her fifth straight-sets victory in a row on the Paris clay.

“It was pretty hard at the beginning because it was hard to get used to the conditions, and also I played all my other matches at 11 a.m so it was like playing in the middle of the night,” she said on Court Philippe Chatrier.

“But I'm pretty happy with my performance.”

Swiatek has a free-flowing game but initially it was 159th-ranked Trevisan, who knocked out American sensation Coco Gauff, 20th seed Maria Sakkari and fifth seed Kiki Bertens on her run to the last eight, who settled quickest.

But once Swiatek loosened up her opponent was always on the back foot, although the Italian did have a couple of break points when the teenager served for the opener at 5-3.

Swiatek saved those and brought up a third set point with a superb topspin lob and converted it when Trevisan made an error.

The pattern continued into the second set and although Trevisan hung in gamely she was no match for one of the game's most exciting talents.

Had Trevisan won she would have set up an unlikely semi-final against Argentina's Nadia Podoroska which would have guaranteed a qualifier reaching a Grand Slam final for the first time in the professional era.

It was not to be though as Swiatek ruthlessly brought her dream run to an abrupt halt in just over an hour.

“I'm really happy anyway,” Trevisan said. “Today was a really tough match. She's a rising player, so she has a lot of positive energy. Today I close a very important chapter of my life. Tomorrow other chapters will begin. I'm just happy.”

Swiatek is also through to the doubles quarter-finals with American partner Nicole Melichar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/x6j8h6/article32787676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWATEKKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/polish-teenager-swiatek-powers-into-french-open-semis/article32787677.ece
3,2020/10/07,"Google faces new antitrust case in India over abuse in smart TVs market, sources say","The case has been filed by two Indian antitrust lawyers, Kshitiz Arya and Purushottam Anand. They both confirmed the case filing against Google for alleged abuse in the smart television market, but declined to comment further.

Alphabet Inc's Google is facing a new antitrust case in India in which the U.S. tech giant is alleged to have abused its Android operating system's position in the smart television market, a source and two lawyers involved in the case told Reuters.

The case is Google's fourth major antitrust challenge in India, one of its key markets where it is currently facing public criticism from local startups for enforcing certain policies and company charges they contend hurt their growth.

It also comes as Google faces new antitrust challenges in the United States, and a potential antitrust probe in China that is set to look into how it allegedly uses its dominance of its Android mobile operating system to stifle competition. Google has denied any wrongdoing.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has since June been looking into allegations that Google engages in anti-competitive practices by creating barriers for firms wanting to use or develop modified versions of Android for smart TVs, such as Amazon Fire TV's operating system, according to the source, who has direct knowledge of the case.

The case has been filed by two Indian antitrust lawyers, Kshitiz Arya and Purushottam Anand. They both confirmed the case filing against Google for alleged abuse in the smart television market, but declined to comment further.

The source said the CCI had directed Google to submit its written responses to the allegations and that the company has sought more time.

A Google spokesman declined comment, since the case with the antitrust body was pending. Amazon and the CCI did not respond to requests for comment.

Unlike Indian court cases, filings and details of cases reviewed by the CCI are not disclosed publicly.

The antitrust watchdog could order a wider investigation against Google if it finds merit in the allegations, or throw out the case completely.

Smart TVs, or WiFi-enabled TVs with apps for streaming services like Netflix and YouTube, have become increasingly popular in India.

Data from Counterpoint Research shows 8 million smart TV sets were sold in India in 2019. Three in five smart TVs sold in India are based on Google's Android system, which also powers nearly 99% of India's half a billion smartphone user base.

The latest case alleges that Google's agreements with companies such as Xiaomi and TV manufacturer TCL India effectively stop them from using both the Android system and a modified version of it on different devices they make, according to the source.

For example, if a company sells smartphones based on Google's Android, it cannot sell smart TVs running on competing platforms like the Amazon Fire TV system, according to the case against the Mountain View, California-based company, the source said.

And in reverse, if a company's smart TV is using Amazon's Fire operating system, then that company is restricted from offering Google's popular Play Store or the Google maps app on its smartphones.

Xiaomi India and TCL India, which is part of China's TCL Technology Group Corp, are both party to the case along with Google. Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment while TCL declined to comment.

In 2018, the CCI fined Google 1.36 billion rupees ($18.5 million) for “search bias,” but a company appeal against that is pending. The CCI last year also started probing Google for allegedly misusing its dominant position to reduce the ability of smartphone makers to opt for alternate versions of its Android system.

Earlier this year, the CCI started reviewing a case alleging that Google abuses its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/uh6qbw/article32794770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/antitrust-googlejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-faces-new-antitrust-case-in-india-over-abuse-in-smart-tvs-market-sources-say/article32794752.ece

Spending on Apple's App Store and Google Play rose more than 30% in the July to September quarter, as compared with the last year, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.

App installs in the quarter grew by nearly 25% compared to the year-ago period, reflecting the continuing global impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

Consumer spending includes in-app purchases, subscriptions and premium app downloads. The App Store earned a revenue of $19 billion this quarter, a 30% rise from last year. Google Play earned a revenue of $10.3 billion.

TikTok was the highest-earning non-gaming app for the second consecutive quarter in terms of spending on both app stores, witnessing 800% growth compared with the same quarter last year, Sensor Tower stated. This comes despite being banned in India, its largest market, and a similar fate in the US.

YouTube and Tinder followed the trend, becoming the second- and the third-highest earning apps this quarter.

First-time app installs also grew by nearly 25%, Google's platform generating thrice the number of installs of Apple's.

8,2020/10/07,"Google, Oracle meet in copyright clash at US Supreme Court","Oracle sued Google seeking over $8 billion, stating it “committed an egregious act of plagiarism” by using 11,330 lines of code part of Oracle's Java platform.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Tech giants Google and Oracle are clashing at the US Supreme Court in a copyright dispute that’s worth billions and important to the future of software development.

The case before the justices Wednesday has to do with Google’s creation of the Android operating system now used on the vast majority of smartphones worldwide. Google says that to create Android, which was released in 2007, it wrote millions of lines of new computer code. But it also used 11,330 lines of code and an organization that’s part of Oracle’s Java platform.

Google has defended its actions, saying what it did is long-settled, common practice in the industry, a practice that has been good for technical progress. But Oracle says Google “committed an egregious act of plagiarism” and sued, seeking more than $8 billion.

The case has been going on for a decade. Google won the first round when a trial court rejected Oracle’s copyright claim, but that ruling was overturned on appeal. A jury then sided with Google, calling its copying “fair use,” but an appeals court disagreed.

Because of the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, only eight justices are hearing the case, and they’re doing so by phone because of the coronavirus pandemic. The questions for the court are whether the 1976 Copyright Act protects what Google copied, and, even if it does, whether what Google did is still permitted.

Oracle, for its part, says the case is simple.

""This case is about theft,” Oracle’s chief Washington lobbyist, Ken Glueck, said in a telephone interview ahead of argument. He compared what Google did to plagiarizing from someone else’s speech. When you plagiarize one line from a speech, he said- “That’s a plagiarized speech. Nobody says, ‘Oh, well, it was just one line.’”

But Google’s Kent Walker, the company’s chief legal officer, said in an interview that Google wrote “every line of code we possibly could ourselves.”

""No one’s ever claimed copyright over software interfaces, but that’s what Oracle is claiming now,” Walker said.

Microsoft, IBM and major internet and tech industry lobbying groups have weighed in - in favor of Google.

The Trump administration, the Motion Picture Association and the Recording Industry Association of America are among those supporting Oracle.

India on Tuesday said it was approving incentives under a federal plan to boost domestic smartphone production to 16 companies, including top Apple suppliers Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron .

India's smartphone industry has become a showpiece for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's “Make In India” drive. The $6.65 billion incentive scheme is part of the government's aim to make the country into an export and manufacturing hub.

The companies have to invest to tap into the scheme. The government did not disclose what investment Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron, which is yet to start Indian operations, will make.

Two sources previously told Reuters these three companies plan to invest a total of almost $900 million in India in the next five years to benefit from the scheme.

Samsung, which runs the world's biggest mobile phone manufacturing plant on the outskirts of New Delhi, also got approval, India's tech ministry said in a statement.

Five Indian companies, including Lava and Micromax also got confirmation, the statement said. The approved companies are expected to produce smartphones and components of more than 10.5 trillion rupees ($143.05 billion), the statement also said.

10,2020/10/07,Facebook bans all QAnon groups as dangerous amid surging misinformation,"Recent QAnon posts have spread false information about voting and about COVID-19, researchers said, even claiming that President Donald Trump faked his diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to orchestrate secret arrests.

Facebook Inc on Tuesday classified the QAnon conspiracy theory movement as dangerous and began removing Facebook groups and pages as well as Instagram accounts that hold themselves out as representatives.

The step escalates an August policy that banned a third of QAnon groups for promoting violence while allowing most to stay, albeit with content appearing less often in news feeds. Instead of relying on user reports, Facebook staff now will treat QAnon like other militarized bodies, seeking out and deleting groups and pages, the company said in a blog post.

Since the August restrictions, some QAnon groups have added members, and others used coded language to evade detection, for example referring to “cue” instead of Q. Meanwhile, adherents have worked to integrate themselves in other groups, such as those concerned with child safety and those critical of restrictions on gatherings due to the coronavirus, according to researchers at Facebook and elsewhere.

While weve removed QAnon content that celebrates and supports violence, weve seen other QAnon content tied to different forms of real world harm, including recent claims that the west coast wildfires were started by certain groups, Facebook wrote.

QAnon messaging changes very quickly and we see networks of supporters build an audience with one message and then quickly pivot to another.

Recent QAnon posts have spread false information about voting and about COVID-19, researchers said, even claiming that President Donald Trump faked his diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to orchestrate secret arrests.

Classed as a potential source of domestic terrorism by the FBI, QAnon is driven by an anonymous internet poster nicknamed Q who claims to be a Trump administration insider. The core, nonsensical claim is that Trump is secretly leading a crackdown against an enormous pedophile ring that includes prominent Democrats and the Hollywood elite.

There has been no surge in arrests, and the fictitious Satanic rituals that the group cites echo longstanding legends used to anger people for political reasons, often against minorities.

Trump has praised the group as patriotic, and more than a dozen Republican congressional candidates have promoted it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/psaids/article32789118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/fbqanonbancomplete,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-bans-all-qanon-groups-as-dangerous-amid-surging-misinformation/article32789100.ece
11,2020/10/07,U.S. lawmakers detail Big Tech's market abuses and press for strict reform,"The antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee recommended that Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple Inc , Amazon.com and Facebook should not both control and compete in related businesses.

A U.S. House of Representatives panel looking into abuses of market power by four big technology companies found they used “killer acquisitions” to smite rivals, charged exorbitant fees and forced small businesses into ”oppressive” contracts in the name of profit.

Also read: Should Big Tech’s dominance be checked?

The antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee recommended that Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple Inc , Amazon.com and Facebook — with a combined market value of over $5 trillion — should not both control and compete in related businesses.

The panel's report broadly recommended structural separations but stopped short of saying a specific company should be broken up.

The scathing 449-page report - the result of the first such congressional review of the tech industry - suggested expansive changes to antitrust law and described dozens of instances where the companies misused their power.

“To put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons,” the report said.

In anticipation of the report, Amazon warned in a blog post Tuesday against “fringe notions of antitrust” and market interventions that “would kill off independent retailers and punish consumers by forcing small businesses out of popular online stores, raising prices and reducing consumer choice.”

Firms disagree

Google said in a statement that it competes “fairly in a fast-moving and highly competitive industry. We disagree with todays reports, which feature outdated and inaccurate allegations from commercial rivals about Search and other services.”

Facebook said, “We compete with a wide variety of services with millions, even billions, of people using them. Acquisitions are part of every industry, and just one way we innovate new technologies to deliver more value to people.”

Apple said, “Scrutiny is reasonable and appropriate but we vehemently disagree with the conclusions.” The company also defended its commission rates and said it would issue a more extensive response in the coming days.

After more than a year of investigation involving 1.3 million documents and more than 300 interviews, the committee led by Democratic Congressman David Cicilline found companies were running marketplaces where they also competed, enabling ”them to write one set of rules for others, while they play by another.”

Coming just weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential election, the report became an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to boost their credibility in the fight against market domination by big tech companies.

That said, Congress is unlikely to act on the findings this year. Since the report reflects the views of the Democratic majority in the House, it signals that if Joe Biden wins the White House, the pressure on the companies could well continue.

Also, the report is likely to inform existing antitrust probes against the companies by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.

Separately, the U.S. Justice Department is investigating large technology companies and is expected to bring a lawsuit against Google soon.

But the report was split along party lines. Republicans on the committee released two short reports, one authored by Representative Ken Buck and supported by three fellow Republicans, which bashed the companies but said that he would not support any call to break them up.

The other was a letter authored by Representative Jim Jordan who criticized Democrats for not probing Big Tech companies for alleged conservative bias and failing to show that existing antitrust law was inadequate.

Recommendations

The panel recommended companies be prohibited from operating in closely aligned businesses. While they did not name any one company, this recommendation would suggest that Google, which runs the auctions for online ad space and participates in those auctions, should potentially be required to separate clearly, or not even operate, the two businesses. For a factbox, click

Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012 is another example of this. Instagram at the time was small and insignificant, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw its potential and noted that it was “building networks that are competitive with our own” and “could be very disruptive to us,” the report said.

An email received by the committee on Sunday from an unnamed former Instagram employee disputed Facebook's contention that the two apps could not easily be pulled apart at this stage.

As part of the report, the committee staff drew up a menu of potential changes in antitrust law.

The suggestions ranged from the aggressive, such as potentially barring companies like Amazon.com from operating the markets in which they also compete, to the less controversial, like increasing the budgets of the agencies that enforce antitrust law: the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission.

The report also urged Congress to allow antitrust enforcers more leeway in stopping companies from purchasing potential rivals, something that is now difficult.

14,2020/10/07,Sri Lanka unveils operation to identify source of virus cluster,"Positive cases linked to a garment factory increase to 1,022.

Days after Sri Lanka identified a new COVID-19 cluster, public health authorities, with the Army assisting them, are frantically tracing the source of the recent infections.

“We have an elaborate operation in place to find out the source of infection,” chief epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera told The Hindu on Wednesday, even as the government widened the curfew to include districts around capital Colombo.

Sri Lanka sees a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases

Sri Lanka had returned to near-normal life in the last couple of months after authorities effectively contained the spread of the virus. But authorities have had to step up targeted testing again, after a woman employed in a garment factory in Minuwangoda, about 40 km north of Colombo, tested positive this weekend. By Wednesday, the cluster rose to 1,022 persons, all employed in the factory. Subsequently the Ministry of Health banned public gatherings until further notice.

‘No India link, false claim’

Meanwhile an Opposition legislator told Parliament on Wednesday about “some Indians” reportedly visiting the garment factory, located near the Bandaranaike International Airport, suggesting that was the source of the infections. However, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva, who heads the National Operation Centre for Prevention of COVID-19 Outbreak, denied the claim. Investigations revealed that there was no evidence of Indians having visited the facility and the claims were “false”, he told media persons. Brandix, the company whose garment factory witnessed the recent outbreak, too said in a statement that: “We can confirm that no parties from India or any other country have had access to the facility during this period.”

Sri Lanka has so far reported 4,442 cases, 3,274 recoveries and 13 deaths since the coronavirus pandemic struck the island nation in March this year. Authorities said at least 64 Sri Lankan migrant workers, mostly employed in West Asian countries, succumbed to Covid-19 in their host countries.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has instructed officials to increase testing to establish the extent of the recent outbreak Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa appealed to citizens and urged them not to panic. “I urge all #SriLankans to not panic, exercise caution, act responsibly & follow the health guidelines stipulated by @MoH_SriLanka.

16,2020/10/07,Pakistan to keep top suspect in Daniel Pearl murder in jail,"Government extends his custody by 3 months during SC hearing.

A British-born Pakistani man who has been on death row over the 2002 killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl will remain in jail for another three months despite his acquittal by a lower court earlier this year, according to a government order on Wednesday.

The development was announced by prosecutors during a brief hearing of the high-profile case at Pakistan’s Supreme Court, which was to decide whether the key suspect in Pearl’s slaying, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, should stay in jail following his acquittal.

More time sought

The court convened on an appeal by Pearl’s family, seeking to keep Sheikh on death row over the beheading of the South Asia bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal.

According to Faisal Siddiqi, the lawyer representing Pearl’s family, government prosecutor Fiaz Shah told the judges he needed more time for paperwork in connection with the case. The judges then adjourned the hearing till October 21.

Mr. Siddiqi, who had expected the court to rule against Sheikh’s acquittal on Wednesday, said he still hopes such a decision would come before the expiration of the suspect’s new, 90-day detention.

Sheikh’s defence lawyer, Mahmood Shaikh, told he had expected his client to walk free on Wednesday.

“My client cannot he kept in jail for an indefinite period,” Mr. Shaikh said.

17,2020/10/07,Concerns about China’s ‘gross aggression’ shared across Quad: U.S. officials,"This is about the free world versus Chinese authoritarianism, State Department officials say

A senior State Department official cited ‘sudden’ and “gross aggression” by China as a concern of the Quad, in response to a question on whether Quad members other than the U.S. were less “forward-leaning” on countering the Chinese threat, and whether the U.S. risked alienating the other three countries with its emphasis on China.

Also read: China’s aggressive actions against India give insight into how CPC thinking these days, says U.S. NSA

“No. That is the concern. I mean, if you look at the conflict on the — in the Himalayas between China and India, something that has been in the past handled according to unspoken or unwritten rules in the past to prevent these things from getting out of control, and then you look at what happened here recently, where you’ve got actually people beating each other to death — no,” the official said.

“… If you look at the single thing that’s driving all this, it’s a sudden turn toward gross aggression by the Chinese government in its entire periphery. I mean, you take it all the way around the Indo-Pacific and its western borders; you’re seeing things that you haven’t seen before, and these are responding to that,” the official said.

Later, the official reiterated that it was not “not just the U.S. dragging folks [ i.e., India, Australia, Japan] who are maybe unwilling or hesitant to” take on the challenges that China was posing. “Everybody likeminded is looking at erosion of democracy, of free market economy and all that, and they’re taking action.”

The comments, transcripts of which were released by the State Department, were made on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s aircraft en route to Anchorage, from Japan, where Mr. Pompeo had met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and counterparts Toshimitsu Motegi of Japan and Marise Payne of Australia for the second “Quad” Minister-level meeting. In Tokyo, Mr. Pompeo had said it was ‘critical’ for Quad partners to “collaborate to protect our people and partners from the CCP’s [Chinese Communist Party] exploitation, corruption, and coercion,” in various geographies including the Himalayas.

“But we also have to frame the problem correctly. This isn’t about a U.S.-China dispute. This is about the free world versus Chinese authoritarianism,” a second senior State Department official said.

Results oriented multilateralism

Asked on speculation by analysts that the Quad sounded like an “Asian NATO”, the first official said looking at the language underpinning the framework of cooperation was on the to-do list for the countries.

Comment | Why China is being aggressive along the LAC

“Well, I mean, one of the projects out of this is to think through what those people sort of balk at: hard, specific language here. Yet nonetheless, as I said, the value set, the worldview and all those things, set up a number of follow-on activities that we can — that we can move out with. I mean, one of those is just simple freedom of movement and navigation.”

“The Secretary [Mr. Pompeo] did say earlier today that he would move to institutionalise the framework. But in terms of what does this kind of multilateralism look like, the Secretary has talked at length about results-oriented multilateralism, about … voluntary groupings of likeminded nations who…share common values of democracy, the rule of law, a respect for human rights and individual freedom,” the second official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4ga9fz/article32796336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-QUAD-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/concerns-about-chinas-gross-aggression-shared-across-quad-us-officials/article32796337.ece
18,2020/10/07,Greece court rules Golden Dawn party criminal organization,"A Greek court ruled on Wednesday that the far-right Golden Dawn party was operating as a criminal organization, following a politically charged five-year trial against dozens of defendants, including former lawmakers of what had become Greece’s third largest party.

Delivering landmark verdicts, the court ruled that seven of the party’s 18 former lawmakers, including party leader Nikos Michaloliakos, were guilty of leading a criminal organization, while the others were guilty of participating in a criminal organization.

Those convicted of leading a criminal organization face between five and 15 years in prison, while the others face sentences of up to 10 years.

As news of the guilty verdicts broke, cheers and celebrations erupted among the crowd of more than 15,000 people gathered in an anti-fascist rally outside the Athens courthouse. A small group among the crowd threw Molotovs and stones at police guarding the courthouse, with authorities responding with tear gas and use of a water cannon. It was not immediately clear why the group began throwing projectiles in the otherwise peaceful rally.

The marathon trial had been assessing four cases rolled into one- the 2013 fatal stabbing of Greek rap singer Pavlos Fyssas, physical attacks on Egyptian fishermen in 2012 and on left-wing activists in 2013, and whether Golden Dawn was operating as a criminal organization.

The 68 defendants included the 18 former lawmakers from the party that was founded in the 1980s as a neo-Nazi organization and rose to become Greece’s third largest party in parliament during the country’s decade-long financial crisis.

The three-member panel of judges also delivered a guilty verdict against Giorgos Roupakias for the murder of Fyssas, prompting applause inside the courtroom and among the crowd outside. Roupakias had been accused of being a party supporter who delivered the fatal stab wounds to Fyssas. Another 15 defendants - none of them former lawmakers - were convicted as accomplices in Fyssas’ killing.

All five people accused of attempted murder in the violence against the migrant fishermen were also found guilty, while the four people accused of attempted murder in the attacks against left-wing activists were found guilty of the lesser charge of causing bodily harm.

""Today marks a huge victory for justice and respect for Greece and the entire world,” Eva Cosse, Greece researcher at Human Rights Watch, told The Assoicated Press. “It sends a strong message that hate crimes are not and should not be tolerated in a democratic society.”

Security was tight at the courthouse, with around 2,000 police, drones and a police helicopter deployed. The avenue outside the Athens courthouse was closed to traffic and the building itself blocked off by a string of police buses.

The crowd at the anti-fascist rally waved banners with slogans including “Fyssas lives, crush the Nazis,” and chanted “The people demand the Nazis in jail.” More than 5,000 people held a similar rally in the northern city of Thessaloniki.

Representatives of parties across the political spectrum, from the governing conservative New Democracy party to Greece’s Communist Party and the former governing left-wing Syriza party, were outside the courthouse.

At the crux of the case was whether the string of violent attacks could be linked to Golden Dawn’s leadership and whether the party was operating as a criminal organization. The preliminary investigation indicated the party operated as a paramilitary group, with orders handed down from the party leadership to neighborhood organizations and onto assault groups which carried out attacks on migrants that often led to serious injury.

But during the course of the trial, the prosecutor recommended the acquittal of many of the party members for the criminal organization charge on the grounds of lack of evidence.

Golden Dawn had denies any direct link to the attacks and described the trial and charges brought against the party’s leadership as an “unprecedented conspiracy” aimed at curbing its rise in popularity.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8l2w35/article32793853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN07GREECEGOLDENDAWN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/greece-court-rules-golden-dawn-party-criminal-organization/article32793825.ece

The Pakistan Navy will add more than 50 vessels, including 20 major ships, to its fleet as part of an ambitious modernisation plan to improve its capabilities, the country’s outgoing Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) said on Wednesday.

Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi said in his farewell address that the Navy will induct four Chinese frigates in the next few years and as many Turkish medium-class ships between 2023 and 2025.

He said the Hangor submarine project, which is being carried out in collaboration with China, was progressing according to the plan, and four submarines were being built each in Pakistan and China.

“This project will transform us from a submarine-operating Navy to a submarine-building one,” Admiral Abbasi was quoted as saying by the state-run Radio Pakistan.

A fleet of more than 50 vessels, including 20 major ships, was envisioned to improve the capabilities of the Navy, the report quoted him as saying.

Admiral Abbasi formally handed over the command of the Pakistan Navy to the new naval chief Admiral Amjad Khan Niazi who assumed charge as the country’s 22nd CNS on Wednesday.

A ceremony held for the change of command was held at PNS Zafar in Islamabad, the Pakistan Navy said in a statement.

Admiral Abbasi said his primary focus had been on transforming the Pakistan Navy into a combat-ready force, with special emphasis on optimum battle preparedness and professional competence.

According to the Pakistan Navy, Admiral Niazi was commissioned in the Operations Branch of Pakistan Navy in 1985 and has served on various command and staff posts.

His previous staff appointments include principal secretary to the chief of the naval staff, head of F-22P Mission China, deputy chief of naval staff (training and evaluation), and director-general of naval intelligence.

20,2020/10/07,"Coronavirus | Pandemic could push 150 million into extreme poverty, says World Bank","Sub-Saharan Africa, with 27-40 million new poor, and South Asia, with 49-57 million, will be badly hit, says the World Bank in its biennial Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report.

Global extreme poverty is expected to rise for the first time in 20 years because of the disruption caused by COVID-19, exacerbating the impact of conflict and climate change, which were already slowing down poverty reduction, the World Bank said on Tuesday. The pandemic may push another 88 million to 115 million into extreme poverty or having to live on less than $1.50 per day, resulting in a total of 150 million such individuals, the Bank said in its biennial Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report.

Some 9.1% to 9.4% of the world will be affected by extreme poverty in 2020, the Bank said, compared to 7.9% in the counterfactual scenario where the pandemic had not raged across the world.

Many of the newly poor individuals will be from countries that already have high poverty rates while many in middle income countries (MICs) will slip below the poverty line, as per the report. Some 82% of the total will be in MICs.

Sub-Saharan Africa, with 27-40 million new poor, and South Asia, with 49-57 million new poor, will be badly hit as per the Bank’s projections.

“The pandemic and global recession may cause over 1.4% of the world’s population to fall into extreme poverty,” World Bank Group President David Malpass said via a press statement.

“In order to reverse this serious setback to development progress and poverty reduction, countries will need to prepare for a different economy post-COVID, by allowing capital, labour, skills, and innovation to move into new businesses and sectors. World Bank Group support... will help developing countries resume growth and respond to the health, social, and economic impacts of COVID-19...,” he said.

22,2020/10/07,US imposes new curbs on H-1B visas,"The technology companies depend on H1-B visas to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

The Trump administration has announced new restrictions on H-1B nonimmigrant visa programme which it said is aimed at protecting American workers, restoring integrity and to better guarantee that H-1B petitions are approved only for qualified beneficiaries and petitioners, a move which is likely to affect thousands of Indian IT professionals.

The interim final rule announced by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday, less than four weeks ahead of the US presidential election, will narrow the definition of specialty occupation as Congress intended by closing the overbroad definition that allowed companies to game the system.

It will also require companies to make real offers to real employees, by closing loopholes and preventing the displacement of the American workers. And finally, the new rules would enhance the department’s ability to enforce compliance through worksite inspections and monitor compliance before, during and after an H1-B petition is approved.

The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.

The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

Such a decision by the Trump administration is likely to have an adverse impact on thousands of Indian IT professionals. Already a large number of Indians on the H-1B visas have lost their jobs and are headed back home during the coronavirus pandemic that has severely hit the US economy.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, the interim final rule to be published in Federal Register will be effective in 60 days.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services is forgoing the regular notice and comment period to immediately ensure that employing H-1B workers will not worsen the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 and adversely affect wages and working conditions of similarly employed US workers, it said.

The pandemic’s economic impact is an obvious and compelling fact that justifies good cause to issue this interim final rule.

We have entered an era in which economic security is an integral part of homeland security. Put simply, economic security is homeland security. In response, we must do everything we can within the bounds of the law to make sure the American worker is put first, said Acting Secretary Chad Wolf.

US Secretary of Labour Eugene Scalia said that these changes will strengthen foreign worker programmes and secure American workers’ opportunities for stable, good-paying jobs.

The US Department of Labour is strengthening wage protections, addressing abuses in these visa programmes and ensuring American workers are not undercut by cheaper foreign labour, she said.

In a conference call with reporters, Deputy Labour Secretary Patrick Pizzella said that these changes were long overdue and it had become imperative in light of the current conditions in the US labour market.

We’re making good on the president’s promise to protect Americans from those who seek to exploit the system for their gain,” he said, adding that the rule would “ensure that Americans are first in line for American jobs as we continue our recovery .

According to the Department of Homeland Security, the H-1B programme was intended to allow employers to fill gaps in their workforce and remain competitive in the global economy, however, it has now expanded far beyond that, often to the detriment of US workers.

Data shows that more than half-a-million H-1B nonimmigrants in the United States have been used to displace US workers, which has led to reduced wages in a number of industries in the US labour market and the stagnation of wages in certain occupations, said the Department of Homeland Security.

This is part of a larger Trump administration goal in coordination with the Department of Labour to protect American workers, it said.

The Department of Labour said that the prevailing wage rates in these programmes play an integral role in protecting US workers from unfair competition posed by the entry of lower cost foreign labour into the US labour market.

It is essential that the methodology used by the Department in calculating the prevailing wage rates accurately reflect what US workers performing the same kinds of jobs and with similar qualifications make to ensure employers cannot use foreign workers in place of US workers, it said.

The Interim Final rule, it said, will improve the accuracy of prevailing wages paid to foreign workers by bringing them in line with the wages paid to similarly employed US workers.

This will ensure that the Department more effectively protects the job opportunities and wages of American workers by removing the economic incentive to hire foreign workers on a permanent or temporary basis in the US over American workers, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tczvjf/article32263809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/H1B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-imposes-new-curbs-on-h-1b-visas/article32790487.ece
23,2020/10/07,U.S. FDA discloses vaccine guidelines blocked by White House,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration laid out updated safety standards Tuesday for makers of COVID-19 vaccines after the White House blocked their formal release, the latest political tug-of-war between the Trump administration and the government’s public health scientists.

In briefing documents posted on its website, the FDA said vaccine makers should follow trial participants for at least two months to rule out safety issues before seeking emergency approval. That requirement would almost certainly preclude the introduction of a vaccine before November 3.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted a vaccine could be authorized before Election Day, even though top government scientists working on the effort have said that timeline is very unlikely.

On Monday Trump said vaccines are coming “momentarily,” in a video recorded after he returned to the White House.

Former FDA officials have warned that public perception that a vaccine was being rushed out for political reasons could derail efforts to vaccinate millions of Americans.

A senior administration official confirmed to the AP on Monday that the White House had blocked FDA’s plans to formally publish the safety guidelines based on the 2-month data requirement, arguing there was “no clinical or medical reason” for it.

But the FDA tucked the information into a memo posted ahead of an October 22 meeting of its outside vaccine advisory panel.

The group of non-governmental experts is scheduled to discuss general standards for coronavirus vaccines, part of FDA’s effort to publicize its process and rationale for vaccine reviews. While information prepared for such panels does not carry the weight of a formal FDA guidance document, the release of the information makes clear the FDA plans to impose the safety standards for any vaccine seeking an expedited path to market.

Also Read Early vaccine results show no major safety issue

To meet the FDA’s threshold, companies would need to submit two months of follow-up from half of their trial participants after they receive their last vaccine dose to show there are no major side effects or health problems. Because vaccines are normally given to otherwise healthy people the FDA requires strict evidence of their safety.

The requirements are aimed at companies seeking rapid approval through the FDA’s emergency authorization pathway. That accelerated process, reserved for health emergencies, allows medical products onto the market based on a lower bar than traditional FDA approval.

Initial doses of vaccines for emergency use would likely be reserved for medical workers and people with health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable to coronavirus. Full FDA approval for the general population will require significantly more data and is not expected until mid-2021.

An FDA spokeswoman said Tuesday the vaccine guidelines are still “under review” but added that “the FDA has already communicated with individual manufacturers about its expectations.”

The White House’s attempt to block the information’s release follows a string of instances in which the Trump administration has undercut its own medical experts working to combat the pandemic. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has been attempting to shore up public confidence in the vaccine review process for weeks, vowing that career scientists, not politicians, will decide if the shots are safe and effective.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has stoked excitement by saying that he expects data on whether the company’s candidate works to be ready in late October. But a number of variables would still have to align for the company to submit, and the FDA to review and greenlight, a vaccine application before November 3. Pfizer’s competitors Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson are working on longer research timelines.

Vaccine development typically takes years, but the U.S. government has invested billions in efforts to accelerate the process and help multiple drugmakers prepare multiple candidates. All the doses will be purchased by the federal government for use vaccinating the U.S. population.

Beyond exposing the rift between the White House and FDA, the release of the information may have limited practical effect.

FDA scientists have been discussing the guidelines publicly for weeks and have made clear that the recommendations have already been shared with each of the vaccine developers.

“The companies know what we’re expecting,” said Dr. Peter Marks, the head of FDA’s vaccine division, in an online interview last week with the nonprofit Friends of Cancer Research.

Instead, Marks said, releasing the guidelines was “an attempt to help the public see what we’re requiring of COVID-19 vaccines.” He added that the guidelines would explain that all upcoming vaccines would be reviewed by FDA’s independent panel of outside vaccine advisers, before the agency makes its own final decision.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/yhuh1l/article32789582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/fdajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fda-discloses-vaccine-guidelines-blocked-by-white-house/article32789576.ece
24,2020/10/07,Biden against second debate if Trump still suffers from COVID-19,"The second debate is scheduled for October 15 in Miami

Democratic Party presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday said he is against participating in his second debate with Donald Trump next week if the President still suffers from COVID-19.

“I think if he still has COVID, we shouldn’t have a debate, “ Mr. Biden, a former US vice-president, told reporters on his return from Gettysburg.

The first of the three presidential debates between Mr. Biden, 77, and Mr. Trump, 74, was held on September 29. The second debate is scheduled for October 15 in Miami and the final one on October 22 in Nashville, Tennessee. Biden said they should follow very strict guidelines.

“Too many people have been infected. It’s a very serious problem, so I will be guided by the guidelines of the Cleveland Clinic and what the docs say is the right thing to do”, he said.

“I’m not sure what President Trump is all about now. I don’t know what his status is. I’m looking forward to being able to debate him but I just hope all protocols are followed,” Mr. Biden said.

Mr. Trump in a tweet on Tuesday said he is looking forward to the debate. I am looking forward to the debate on the evening of Thursday, October 15th in Miami. It will be great”, said the President.

The only vice-presidential debate between Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris and Vice-President Mike Pence in scheduled for Wednesday in Salt Lake City, Utah.

25,2020/10/07,Another Trump aide tests positive for COVID-19,"This takes the number of White House staffers infected by the deadly virus to at least 10

Stephen Miller, a top aide to President Donald Trump, tested positive for COVID-19, taking the number of White House staffers infected by the deadly virus to at least 10.

“Over the last five days I have been working remotely and self-isolating, testing negative every day through yesterday. Today, I tested positive for COVID-19 and am in quarantine,” Mr. Miller said in a statement.

President Trump, along with First Lady Melania Trump, tested positive for coronavirus last Thursday, soon after it was known that their close aide Hope Hicks contracted the infection.

Mr. Trump was admitted to a military hospital on Friday and was discharged on Monday.

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and three of the staff from the press office also tested positive. At least three journalists working at the White House tested positive for the infection.

On Tuesday, the White House issued an updated guideline on health and safety of the residence staff.

With the recent positive results of the President and First Lady, staff wear full PPE and continue to take all necessary precautions, which include updated procedures to protect against cross contamination, it said. The residence staff in direct contact with the Trump family are tested daily, with the support staff tested every 48 hours.

In addition to support from a medical unit, independent health consultants have been hired, who are available to check the staff and their families, facilitating ancillary testing as needed, it added.

As per another memorandum, Vice-President Mike Pence tested negative on Tuesday.

He is scheduled to have his vice-presidential debate with Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris at Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in another statement said from a public standpoint, it is safe for the vice-president to participate in the upcoming debate.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/x9h34m/article32788348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/another-trump-aide-tests-positive-for-covid-19/article32788349.ece
26,2020/10/07,America has become a dangerous place: Joe Biden,"There’s something bigger going on in this nation than broken politics, something darker, says the Democratic presidential nominee.

Standing in front of a field in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where a significant battle in the American Civil War was fought, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden spoke of a country divided and the need to come together. The former Vice President said America had become a “dangerous place” with something “darker” and more “dangerous” than just broken politics.

“There’s no more fitting place than here today in Gettysburg, to talk about the cost of division. About how much it has cost America in the past, about how much it is costing us now, and about why I believe in this moment, we must come together as a nation,” he said in a speech of a little over 20 minutes.

“There’s something bigger going on in this nation than just our broken politics. Something darker, something more dangerous... Too many Americans seek not to overcome our divisions, but to deepen them,” he said.

Mr. Biden repeated a campaign theme: that while he is running as a “proud Democrat”, he would work for those who vote for him and those who do not. Mr. Biden, who first joined the U.S. Senate in 1973, has campaigned on his ability to work across aisle and committed to doing the same as President.

Balancing act

Mr. Biden has had to balance the expectations of his constituents on the left — such as progressives who did not see their candidate Bernie Sanders make it past the primaries — in addition to catering to his own moderate support base, while also appealing to Republicans disenchanted with the Trump administration.

Joe Biden takes lead in battleground State

“I do not believe we have to choose between law and order, and racial justice in America. We can have both,” Mr. Biden said on Tuesday. The death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of police officers sparked protests this summer that have spread across the country. While most of the protests have been peaceful, some have turned violent. Mr. Trump and Republicans have accused Mr. Biden of being soft on law and order — using violence against law enforcement officials to bolster their case.

Talking about white supremacists, Mr. Biden said that in a Biden administration, hate would be given “no license” and “no oxygen”.

“I think about what it takes for a black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country. That has for far too long, never been recognised,” Mr. Biden said.

Scepticism for masks

Mr. Biden said wearing a mask and social distancing were not political statements but scientific recommendations. His opponent Mr. Trump’s scepticism for masks and social distancing have been widely criticised. Mr. Trump and many of those who recently attended non-socially distant gatherings at the White House had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Later on Tuesday, after Mr. Trump had tweeted that he was looking forward to the second debate with Mr. Biden scheduled for October 15, Mr. Biden said the debate should not go ahead if the President is still infected.

27,2020/10/07,4 Rohingya refugees killed in factional attack in Bangladesh,"They used locally made guns and sharp weapons at Kutupalong in Ukhiya in Cox’s Bazar district

Bangladesh’s police recovered said at least four people died after members of two factions of criminals attacked each other in a sprawling camp for Rohingya refugees late Tuesday, officials said.

Another 20 refugees were injured as the two groups opened fire, used locally made guns and sharp weapons at Kutupalong in Ukhiya in Cox’s Bazar district, said Rafiqul Islam, an additional police superintendent.

Security was heightened in the camps in the district where more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar have been sheltered by the government, he said.

The official said at least seven Rohingya refugees, including those who died Tuesday, had been killed in clashes to establish dominance in the area over last few days.

Bangladesh authorities and intelligence officials have long been saying that many of the refugees are involved in illicit drug trade, smuggling, robbery and ransom-seeking. Earlier Tuesday, the elite security agency Rapid Action Battalion arrested nine refugees suspected of being involved in various criminal activities.

They had firearms, bullets and sharp weapons, Islam said. Local media reported that Tuesday’s chaos began after the arrest of the suspects as one group blamed another for helping the security agency in detaining them. Human rights groups that are involved in the camps acknowledge there are criminal elements among the Rohingya refugees.

In January, at least four suspected Rohingya criminals were shot dead in a gunfight with police while in March last year another seven suspects were fatally shot by the security officials.

They were allegedly involved in dug dealing and human trafficking. More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar into Bangladesh after the Buddhist-majority country’s military launched a crackdown against them in August 2017 in response to an attack by insurgents.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4-rohingya-refugees-killed-in-factional-attack-in-bangladesh/article32788210.ece
28,2020/10/07,Coronavirus | Trump stirs controversy by pulling out of talks with Democrats on aid package,"Mr Trump played down the seriousness of the virus in online posts, seeking to get more Americans back to work and to generate optimism ahead of the November election.

President Donald Trump stirred controversy on Tuesday, his first full day as a COVID-19 outpatient, by pulling out of talks with Democrats on an economic aid package for the country and drawing rebukes from Facebook and Twitter for spreading misinformation about the coronavirus.

After days of conflicting messages from doctors and aides about his condition, the Republican president, 74, showed he still had what it takes to fire off startling Twitter posts.

Mr Trump played down the seriousness of the virus in online posts, seeking to get more Americans back to work and to generate optimism ahead of the November election.

“Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!” Mr Trump wrote on Twitter and Facebook.

Twitter Inc responded by putting a warning label on the post, saying it included potentially misleading information. Facebook Inc removed the Trump post for breaking its rules on COVID-19 misinformation, according to CNN.

“This is a lie. The flu doesnt kill 100,000 a year,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, tweeted. Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said the threat from COVID-19 was “very, very much different” than influenza's reach.

The United States has the world's highest death toll from the pandemic, with more than 209,000 deaths. By comparison, influenza typically kills between some 22,000 and 64,000 people a year in the United States, U.S. government statistics show.

In his first major policy pronouncement since returning to the White House from the hospital, Mr Trump abruptly called off negotiations with Democratic lawmakers on coronavirus relief legislation until after the election, even as cases of the virus are on the rise across much of the country.

“I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business,” Mr Trump wrote on Twitter.

Following his announcement, U.S. stocks were down more than 2 percent in late afternoon trading.

Mr Trump's chances of winning re-election have taken a hit over the millions of jobs lost during coronavirus lockdowns. His surprising withdrawal from the talks raises doubts about how quickly the U.S. economy can recover.

Mr Trump tested positive for coronavirus last week after months of playing down the deadly infection.

His doctor said on Tuesday that Mr Trump reported no COVID-19 symptoms and was doing “extremely well.” Sean Conley, a Navy commander, said Mr Trump's vital signs remained stable, with an oxygen saturation level of 95-97%.

Mr Trump had no public events listed for Tuesday and it was unclear when he would resume a full schedule of presidential duties and campaigning ahead of Election Day, Nov. 3.

He also tweeted that he was looking forward to a scheduled second debate with Democratic election opponent Joe Biden on Oct. 15 and wrote that he was feeling great. He had yet to be seen in public or to release a new video since Monday night.

Mr Trump spent three days at a military hospital and was due to receive further doses of the antiviral drug remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone, which is normally used in the most severe cases.

Campaign trail

Trailing Mr Biden in opinion polls, Mr Trump's campaign sought to project an image of a strong president who is overcoming his illness and planning to get back on the campaign circuit.

“We're looking forward to him getting back on the trail when the doctors say it's physically feasible for him to do so. He's ready now,” Mr Trump campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley told Fox News.

A Twitter post by Mr Biden showed images of himself donning a mask and Trump removing his. “Masks Matter. They save lives,” the caption read.

Dr Fauci, a well-known infectious diseases expert on the White House coronavirus task force, said COVID-19, which has killed a million people worldwide, was fiercer than influenza.

“The potential for what COVID... can do is very, very much different from influenza. You don't get a pandemic that kills a million people - and it isn't even over yet - with influenza,” Fauci said told NBC News.

Mr Trump returned to the White House on Monday in a made-for-television spectacle, descending from his Marine One helicopter wearing a white surgical mask, only to remove it as he posed, saluting and waving, on the mansion's South Portico.

The severity of his illness has been the subject of intense speculation, with some experts noting that, as an overweight, elderly man, he was in a high risk category.

#GaspingForAir began trending on Twitter after video showed Trump appearing to take several deep breaths while standing on the White House balcony.

Many Trump aides and confidants have been diagnosed with the disease since his announcement last week that he had tested positive, intensifying scrutiny and criticism of the administration's handling of the pandemic.

White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany, herself diagnosed with the virus, said the rise in COVID-19 cases at the White House and among some Republican senators was not disrupting the functioning of the U.S. government.

29,2020/10/07,Bihar Assembly elections | Congress releases first list,"The party is set to contest 70 seats

Barely 24 hours before the process of filing nominations for the first phase of the Bihar Assembly elections gets over, the Congress on Wednesday released its first list of 21 candidates.

Election for the first phase in the three-phase election will be held on October 28.

The party nominated Shubhanand Mukesh, who is the son of the Congress Legislature Party leader in Bihar Sadanand Singh, a nine-term MLA, for the Kahalgaon Assembly seat.

Even though the list was formally released late on Wednesday evening, Mr. Mukesh had already filed his nomination as the party’s candidate earlier in the day.

Another notable candidate was Akhauri Onkar Nath from Gaya, who was a last minute replacement as the party’s earlier nominee, a powerful local politician, was dropped following rape charges against him.

On Tuesday, The Hindu had reported that the party had withheld three names as they faced serious charges of crimes against women.

Former Bihar Youth Congress chief Lallan Yadav has been given a ticket from the Sultanganj seat.

The last minute announcement was part of the party’s strategy to avoid a backlash from aspirants who did not find a place among the successful candidates, said a source. Of the 21 candidates, while five sittings MLAs have found a place, an equal number of newcomers who recently joined the party have also been accommodated, creating a sense of resentment among party old-timers.

“The central leaders knew that if they had announced the names earlier, then there would have been greater scrutiny. That’s why they individually informed the candidates on phone to keep their papers ready but announced the list only now,” said a Bihar Congress leader who did not wish to be named.

Earlier, the central election committee of the party, headed by party chief Sonia Gandhi, cleared their names.

The Congress will be contesting on 70 seats as part of the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led ‘grand alliance’ in Bihar.

30,2020/10/07,Bihar Assembly election: JD(U) offers ticket to Manju Verma,"Former minister had to resign after her husband’s name came up in the Muzaffarpur shelter home abuse case

Bihar’s ruling party, the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) on Wednesday released a list of all 115 party candidates for the upcoming Assembly poll, and among them was the name of the former minister in Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s cabinet Manju Verma, who had to resign after her husband’s name had come up in the Muzaffarpur shelter home abuse case involving 34 minor girls.

In the list, Ms. Verma’s name figured on serial number 64 to contest from the Cheria-Bariyarpur Assembly constituency of Begusarai district. Ms. Verma was the social welfare minister in Mr. Kumar’s cabinet but after her husband Chandrashekhar Verma’s name figured in the Muzaffarpur shelter home case related to the sexual and physical abuse of 34 minor girls, she had to resign from the cabinet. She was also arrested under the Arms Act in November 2018, when the police had conducted a raid at her house in connection with the shelter home abuse case, and was sent to jail. Later, she was granted bail by the Patna High Court.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which was investigating the Muzaffarpur shelter home abuse case, had conducted a raid at the Vermas’ ancestral house. As many as 50 illegal cartridges were recovered from the residence. Ms. Verma, along with her husband Chandrashekhar Verma, was later booked under the Arms Act at the Cheria-Bariyarpur police station in Begusarai district. Ms.Verma was also suspended from the JD(U).

Recently, Ms. Verma was seen standing in a long queue outside the JD(U) headquarters, where party president and CM Nitish Kumar was meeting party leaders who wanted to contest the upcoming Assembly poll.

In the JD(U)’s list of party candidates for the Assembly elections, most of the candidates have been repeated.

Jharkhand Mukti Morcha on Tuesday accused RJD of “politically cheating” them and announced that it will contest alone on seven seats in Bihar elections. Though not a formal member of the Grand Alliance in Bihar, Lalu Prasad’s party that spearheads the Opposition coalition there had declared last week that it will accommodate the Jharkhand ruling party from its quota of 144 seats.

JMM General Secretary Supriyo Bhattachaya told PTI that they have decided to go alone in Bihar polls due to “political cheating” by Lalu Prasad’s party.

He said the party will contest seven Assembly seats located on borders with the State that will witness voting in the second and third phases. This number could also increase later, he added. JMM has no legislator in the outgoing house in Bihar.

JMM which has made the lone RJD MLA in Jharkhand a Minister was expecting kind treatment from Lalu Prasad’s party in the neighbouring State. Asked if this would have any impact on the ruling coalition of JMM-Congress-RJD in Jharkhand, Mr. Bhattcharya answered in negative.

Mr. Bhattacharya who is also party’s chief spokesman said, “RJD should not forget that we gave them a handsome number of seats in 2019 Jharkhand Assembly elections more than its ‘Haisiyat’ (capacity) and also made the lone MLA of the party a Minister.”

Taking a swipe at RJD Chief Ministerial candidate Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, he said “the man who has become a new leader of the party seems to have forgotten everything.”

“We waited till today but the situation has become clear to us and we decided to fight the Bihar polls alone,” the JMM General Secretary said.

While declaring the seat-sharing formula for Bihar elections on Friday last, Tejashwi Yadav had said that his party will accommodate JMM and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) from its quota of 144 seats out of total 243 seats.

VIP has already pulled out of the grand alliance and is expected to be accomodated by the BJP from its share of seats.

32,2020/10/07,Bihar Assembly election | BJP gives 11 seats from its quota to Vikassheel Insaan Party,"Three-phase elections to the State Assembly are scheduled to begin on October 28

The Bhartiya Janata Party on Wednesday gave 11 seats from its quota to Mukesh Sahni-led Vikassheel Insaan Party, the new entrant to the NDA alliance in Bihar.

Bihar Assembly election: Congress withholds three names

Earlier, the two major alliance partners had shared the 243 State assembly seats between themselves: the JD(U) 122 and the BJP 121. Three-phase elections to the Assembly are scheduled to begin on October 28.

On Tuesday, JD(U) had allocated seven seats from its quota to another alliance partner, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular)-led by former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi.

“We’ve allocated 11 seats and one State council seat to VIP… The BJP has always respected people from Extremely Backward Castes…in the last Assembly poll, our party gave 25 seats to EBS candidates, of which they won 12,” said senior State BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi. “It was the NDA government that came up with 20% reservation for EBC in panchayat poll and today over 1600 mukhias [village heads] in Bihar are from these castes.”

Addressing media persons, VIP leader Mukesh Sahni said he was happy to return to the BJP-led NDA. “I had started my political innings in the 2014 Lok Sabha poll with the aim of making Narendra Modi the Prime Minister,” he said.

Earlier on October 2, Mr. Sahni had stunned the mahagathbandhan leaders by making an abrupt exit from the press meet called to announce the seat allocation among alliance partners. “I was stabbed in the back and cheated,” Mr. Sahni said while making a hasty exit.

The VIP has been given Brahmpur, Bochaha, Gaura Bauram, Simri Bakhtiyarpur, Sugauli, Madhubani, Kewati, Sahebganj, Balrampur, Ali Nagar and Baniapur.

Filing of nominations begins

Meanwhile, candidates have started filing nominations for the first-phase of elections for 71 seats. October 8 is the last date for filing nominations. Senior BJP leader Prem Kumar filed his papers for the eighth time from the Gaya assembly constituency, while HAM(S) party leader Jitan Ram Manjhi filed his nomination from Imamganj constituency.

Imprisoned bahubali (strongman) Anant Singh too filed his nomination papers on Wednesday from Mokama assembly constituency as an RJD candidate. His wife Neelam Devi is contesting from the same constituency as an Independent candidate. Mr. Singh had won from Mokama constituency in 2015 from jail. He had won from the same constituency in 2005 and 2010 as JD(U) candidate.

The BJP had on Tuesday announced a list of 27 candidates for the first phase of poll, including 16 from the upper caste, three from the Yadav caste and three from EBC. The RJD has announced 41 candidates, mostly from the Yadav caste. The Congress announced 21 names, giving the highest number, 14, to the upper castes, four to SC, two to the Backward Class and one to the Muslim community.

BJP leaders join LJP

Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders Rameshwar Chourasia and Usha Vidyarthi joined the Lok Janshakti Party on Wednesday, triggering speculations that the LJP is contesting the upcoming poll as a “proxy” for the BJP.

Earlier, State BJP vice-president and former senior RSS functionary Rajendra Singh too joined the LJP and is set to contest from Dinara constituency against JD(U) candidate and Minister in the Nitish Kumar Cabinet Jai Kumar Singh.

34,2020/10/07,A new bag of tricks: How magicians are upping their online game,"Can someone in Villivakkam read your mind from Vishakapatnam? Meet the magicians who are now entertaining the world from their living rooms

It is a Saturday evening, and Arun the mentalist — or ATM, as he calls himself — has his eyes focussed on the camera. He is ready to unleash one of his most popular tricks on the 50-plus audience who have turned up for his live virtual show on Zoom.

He writes on a piece of paper, and places it inside a bowl that everyone can see. He then requests volunteers from the audience, and three — from different parts of the world, unrelated to each other — give answers to three questions: favourite holiday destination, what they would eat there and the rough cost of this dinner.

Minutes later, Arun opens that piece of paper and shows the world that he had already predicted these answers: the US, curd rice and $99, plus tax.

The audience unmute themselves and clap in disbelief. From his modest Villivakkam residence in Chennai, Arun Loganathan grins widely as he bows in acknowledgement.

Arun the mentalist

For Arun and many of his peers in the magic-mentalist industry, the world has opened up online to witness their magic that unfolds in their drawing rooms.

When the pandemic and lockdown hit, most of the corporate world adapted to a rigorous WFH routine. But the transition was not so smooth for magicians and performers, who thrive on the energy and allure of the stage.

A new act

Delhi-based illusionist Karan Singh, who has been performing since 2008, used the lockdown to write a new show: one that would include new tricks for online performances.

Karan Singh

“Writing a show generally takes six to eight months but due to the increased frequency of the performances during lockdown, I could do it in a few weeks,” he says. He has been presenting that, and doing magic videos in collaboration with comedians and influencers like Samay Raina, Tanmay Bhat and Bhuvan Bam for the past months.

Karan believes that the pandemic has opened up a world of possibilities for performers. “It is a little difficult for magicians as they require a bigger space and props, but for mentalists who can read your mind and figure out your ATM pin or phone password, a corner of the house is enough,” says Karan, who adds that he is going the extra mile to adapt to international performances — he recently performed at 3am IST for audiences in the US and the UK.

Mumbai-based Naman Anand is a relatively new entrant in the magic space; he started his professional career with virtual shows earlier this year, after many years of dabbling in it as a hobby. “During virtual shows, every person feels like they have a prized front-row seat,” says Naman.

Naman Anand

Nikhil Raj has been doing something similar from Bengaluru; the illusionist has been trying to incorporate elements of comedy in his online shows, which revolve around mentalism and conjuring. “In one of my initial shows, a member of the audience pointed out that I was doing tricks using props from my desk. Since then, I tell audiences to keep something ready in their house; objects like pen, paper and phone, and try to perform a trick using that,” adds Nikhil, who has been busy these last few months, with over 35 virtual sessions.

Nikhil Raj

Preparation for such online shows requires time, effort and money. Arun took a ride to Ritchie Street, Chennai’s well-known electronics hub, to purchase a couple of lights, a microphone and a green screen. He converted a part of his bedroom to a studio containing a two-camera setup. “My home is my stage now,” beams Arun, who also attempted a blindfold act virtually.

The wow factor

With such virtual shows being the new normal, how do magicians plan their future performances?

Addressing this question was the legendary magician David Copperfield, who spoke about various challenges on a recent Facebook Live hosted by Chennai-based popular magician SAC Vasanth. Vasanth, who has done numerous TV shows involving magic, might be popular for being the “man who predicted Garry Kasparov’s next move” but the last few months sans live stage shows have been a challenge.

“The transition was difficult,” he admits, “Even on a live stage, we are asked a hundred questions. On an online platform, we need to convince audiences. Believability is a big factor. David [Copperfield] stressed about the need to pick your genre of magic, and improve presentation skills.”

Vasanth seems to have cracked that; since March, he has done more than 30 virtual shows, most of them ticketed. “We keep it limited to 25 tickets, priced at ₹2,000 each for a one-hour show. The advantage is that everyone in the family can gather around the laptop and enjoy the show.” For such events, he does tricks connecting all 25 people — they each think of a number that adds up to one grand number, which Vasanth reveals he had predicted on his Instagram page a day before!

He has also been doing special shows for companies in which he incorporates elements from their line of work. For Saint Gobain employees, Vasanth inserted a prediction inside a piece of glass, while for the staff of Nippon Paint, he worked out a few special tricks using colour concepts. “I do miss the claps and interaction that happens during live stage shows, but we are still entertaining audiences. Magic is all about making people happy. That’s what matters.”

35,2020/10/07,These idli carts help transwomen earn with dignity,"Self-reliance comes in all shapes and sizes. For Project Dignity, it takes the form of a pushcart

“I don’t want to give temporary charity to transwomen. I think they deserve better than that,” says Apsara Reddy, a day after the launch of the latest phase of her Project Dignity. Including this phase, the project has set up 11 functional small-business carts, offering — among other things — idlis and other foods, and a tailoring service.

The idea is self-reliance, particularly since many formal employment opportunities are still not within reach of many in the community, points out Reddy. “For this project, we are picking transwomen from the low income bracket, and those who are a little older and need to be able to not be dependent,” she adds.

But is it easy for someone to cook, sell and manage money at the same time, particularly if they have not done so before? Explains Apsara, “Before we launch such carts, we spend three weeks training them on running the business: on things like how much to charge for an item and when to restock on raw materials. We go through the whole thing explaining how much they can make, based on what they are given.”

What each businesswoman-in-the-making is given, besides the pushcart, is the first batch of all raw materials required — be it ingredients for dosa batter or spools of thread — as well as equipment like pans and sewing machines. Beyond that, how to procure fresh raw material from their earnings is yet another lesson to be learnt. Project organisers are also in talks with local businesses in the area to help create a client base.

There are other phases being planned after this one, wherein Project Dignity will be spread to other towns and cities of Tamil Nadu. Says Apsara, “Our target is 100 carts by the end of 2021. After Chennai, the next stops planned for now are first Salem, then Madurai. We are in talks with local businesses in Salem for tie-ups.”

Tie-ups and corporate sponsorships, she explains, play an important role in projects such as this one. In Chennai, she is warm in her gratitude to some NGOs and corporations, particularly the Radiant Group, and social welfare organisation RCC Diva Foundation. All of it, she says, is towards the same end.

Because everyone, after all, “is worthy of owning a business, of earning a sustainable and meaningful livelihood.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/r484ck/article32789052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7MPApsara-Reddy,https://www.thehindu.com/society/these-idli-carts-help-transwomen-earn-with-dignity/article32789053.ece

37,2020/10/07,HDFC Bank offers loan for care at Apollo,"HDFC Bank has tied up with Apollo Hospitals Ltd. to offer its customers unsecured, pre-approved loan of up to ₹40 lakh for medical expenses incurred at the healthcare chain.

‘The Healthy Life Programme’ will be offered exclusively to HDFC Bank customers at Apollo 24/7.

As per the plan, the bank’s customers will have round-the-clock access to an emergency doctor at the hospital at no cost along with benefits such as a choice of payment options and ease of finance for treatment at all Apollo Hospitals.

The initiative was launched digitally by HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri, and Apollo Hospitals Group chairman, Prathap C. Reddy in the presence of Apollo Hospitals group executive vice-chairperson Shobana Kamineni, and HDFC Bank MD-designate Sashidhar Jagdishan.

The two biggest challenges in a medical emergency or keeping healthy are access to trusted, quality healthcare and easy finance at scale. The coming together of these two leading players aims to address precisely this through the combined reach of the two organizations, a HDFC Bank official said.

“To me it is like a mini health mission that will revolutionise access to quality healthcare for millions of our countrymen. They can get medical services at a place and time of their choice. “

“The loans will be disbursed almost instantly when the need for money arises, and the patients, who are HDFC Bank customers, will receive preferential treatment,” said Mr. Puri.

About 40% of India is only about 30 minutes away from an Apollo pharmacy while over 85% of the districts in the country are served by an HDFC Bank branch. The two organisations have the potential to initially serve 65 million existing HDFC Bank customer along with the new ones who will be onboarded along the journey of this partnership, added Ms. Kamineni.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/hdfc-bank-offers-loan-for-care-at-apollo/article32797368.ece
38,2020/10/07,‘Check facial recognition misuse’,"Protect democratic freedom, says Microsoft’s Smith

Countries around the globe, including India, should have proper regulations to ensure governments do not use facial recognition or any other facet of artificial intelligence (AI), in a way that would impinge on peoples’ most-cherished democratic freedoms, urged Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer, Microsoft.

“What does facial recognition mean in a country, say in India, or a world where we value freedom of expression, where we want people to have the freedom to assemble,” asked Mr. Smith.

“Should we be comfortable with the prospect that people can be surveilled if they are peacefully protesting?” he queried while speaking at RAISE 2020, a virtual global AI summit.

Mr. Smith discussed transparency and accountability as the foundational principles that can ensure the ethical use of AI. Before any country advances, it must advance a responsible AI that’s grounded in clear and firm ethical principles, he insisted.

Mr. Smith saw work on AI being done in India to be very important. “One of the reasons I think the work in India is of such fundamental importance globally is that I think these issues around facial recognition, for example, go to the heart of democratic freedoms, and it will be the world’s great democracies that need to lead the way,” he said.

Mr. Smith sees India becoming a superpower in AI. “As we look to the future, I think it’s fair to say that between now and the middle of this century India almost inevitably will become one of the world’s AI superpowers,’’ he further added.

While AI can revolutionise virtually every part of the economy, Mr. Smith said countries that move the fastest while deploying AI will find they will be accelerating economic growth faster.

However, the bedrock of a responsible AI strategy should be accountability. Plus, it should be fair, unbiased, and it should offer security and safety, to ensure people’s privacy, and most importantly, it should be inclusive, by all means, he advised.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/um4kfs/article32797356.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THBUMICROSOFT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/check-facial-recognition-misuse/article32797357.ece

It will touch the mark this financial year thereby also becoming the first ₹1,000-crore personal care brand for ITC, chief executive (personal care products business) Sameer Satpathy said on Wednesday.

Contributing to the increase was the addition of a number of products to the portfolio amid a growing concern for hygiene following the COVID-19 outbreak. The list includes Savlon surface disinfectant spray, Wipes, cloth disinfectant as well as the Savlon Hexa range of sanitisers, bodywash and soaps.

Describing Savlon as a successful acquisition, Mr. Satpathy said Vivel with consumer spending of ₹500 crore was the highest personal care brand for ITC last year. Attributing the rise of Savlon to the product portfolio expansion, he said the growing consumer demand was met by ramping up of production facilities, including a partner unit in south India coming on stream. ITC has also decided to set up a personal care production facility in east India, the details of which were yet to be finalised.

41,2020/10/07,‘Need short-term relief to retain long-term growth hopes’,"Spend more to limit damage: Rajan

Emerging markets must take urgent relief measures to address distress among households and small firms due to the pandemic and lockdowns, instead of holding off for a stimulus package after the virus is reined in, former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday.

Speaking at ICRIER’s annual G20 conference, Dr. Rajan said countries such as Mexico, Peru and India have been very badly affected by the pandemic, both in terms of infection rates and the adverse effects on households and firms.

“Many governments have been cautious, and some would argue overly cautious, because they have lower resources for relief, and they fear rating downgrades. For a number of countries, the right thing to do, which is perhaps what the IMF is now saying, is to spend to diminish the damage than to wait to spend hoping that it will increase demand,” Dr. Rajan said, stressing that relief was distinct from stimulus measures that only aim to increase demand.

“If you don’t provide relief, your small and medium firms and households are much less able to produce or spend when the recovery happens, and the economy’s potential growth is reduced largely from the supply side. Some countries are saying let’s wait till we control the pandemic because then we can boost demand by a whole bunch of stimulus spending,” Dr. Rajan said, underlining that such a stimulus would be extremely inflationary smaller firms have gone out of business.

India can expand its fiscal space for spending more on relief measures if it can build institutions to convince markets that it will be fiscally responsible over the medium term.

“Adopt a debt target with legislation, appoint that independent fiscal commission which will look at Budgets and talk about where there is lack of transparency, hiding the true fiscal position,” he said, adding this required significant reform actions in the short term but which could trigger a virtuous cycle.

“The alternative is a vicious cycle, if the government is frozen and does nothing, saying I won’t spend because I don’t have the money, rating agency will downgrade me… so we will pick up the pieces when we find them. (Then) private sector deteriorates, growth potential falls, and the rating agencies eventually decide you have huge debts, are not growing, so let me downgrade you anyway,” he said, adding that this holds true for many emerging markets.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/8syxcn/article32797311.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THBURAJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/need-short-term-relief-to-retain-long-term-growth-hopes/article32797312.ece

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) on Wednesday reported second-quarter net profit declined 7% to ₹7,475 crore, from ₹8,042 crore in the year-earlier period.

Net income after excluding a provision of ₹1,218 crore towards a legal claim, however, was 4.9% higher at ₹8,433 crore, TCS said. Consolidated revenue grew 3% to ₹40, 135 crore. Revenue in constant currency terms, however, declined 3.2% on a year-on-year basis, TCS said in a regulatory filing.

43,2020/10/07,India accounts for 10% of global analytics job openings: study,"Country had 93,500 job openings for data scientists/analysts in August

A study on jobs and hiring trends in analytics and data science domains shows over 93,500 data science jobs were vacant in India at the end of August 2020.

Despite COVID 19, as per the survey conducted by edtech firm Great Learning, the enthusiasm and optimism around the analytics function in India continues to remain high with India contributing 9.8% of the total global analytics job openings in August 2020 compared to 7.2% in January this year. While the sector did witness a slight decrease in vacancies (from 109,000 in February to 82,500 in May 2020), the demand has continued to be fairly consistent across key industry sectors.

Hari Krishnan Nair, Co-founder, Great Learning said, “Our study found that over 93,500 data science job positions were vacant in India in August. We have seen an immense growth in the demand for professionals proficient with skills in data science and analytics. A key reason for this is the increased availability of quality analytics talent in the country which has led to captive firms and international IT and KPO corporations moving more of their business to India, investing in newer technologies and digital competencies and opening new positions here.’’

“The factors contributing to the increased demand include a year-on-year increase in funding in Indian analytics startups, investment in the development of enhanced analytics capabilities in India, and a greater proportion of jobs outsourced to firms based in India owing to the pandemic,’’ the study observed.

The current demand is dominated by MNC and Domestic IT & KPO organisations that are shifting jobs to India and are recruiting in large numbers.

The study also reveals a growing demand for mid and senior level professionals with over seven years of experience in 2020. Professionals with more than seven years of experience commanded the highest proportion of jobs with a share of 14.9% in August 2020, up from 12.5% in January 2020 and 6.7% last year. Interestingly, the demand for those with 10 to 15 years of experience increased to 11% in August 2020 after doubling to 8.6% in January 2020 from last year. The demand for those with 15+ years of experience has also witnessed a big leap to 4.9% in August 2020 after almost tripling to 2.8% in January 2020 from 1% last year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-accounts-for-10-of-global-analytics-job-openings-study/article32797080.ece

The local unit opened at 73.53 at the interbank forex market, then lost ground and touched 73.55 against the US dollar, down 9 paise over its last close of 73.46.

Asian currencies are trading weak against USD. The rupee is likely to trade in an intra-day range of 73.35-73.65, said Abhishek Goenka, Founder and CEO, IFA Global.

The rupee continues to follow a trading pattern wherein nationalised banks aggressively buy the dips to 73.10-73.15 and buy all the way up to 73.45-73.50, Goenka said.

“Considering the fact that foreign direct investment (FDI) related inflows are lined up and the reaction function of nationalised banks, we expect the rupee to continue trading in the 72.90-73.90 range,” he said.

Meanwhile, on the global front, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday instructed his officials to stop negotiating with the House Democrats on coronavirus stimulus.

“The overall risk sentiment was holding up until Trump said he was holding back the talks on fiscal stimulus until after the election. The yield on the US 10-year bond touched the highest level since June this year but retreated post president Trump’s comment,” Goenka said.

On the domestic front, the newly-constituted Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank is scheduled to begin its three-day deliberations starting during the day. The decision of the rate-setting panel will be announced on October 9.

47,2020/10/07,"Services PMI shows slump easing, but job losses swell","Sept. reading shows activity contracted for a seventh month

The pace of contraction in services sector activity eased considerably in September after the government lifted some COVID-19 restrictions, but demand continued to shrink, prompting firms to cut more jobs, a business survey showed on Tuesday.

Signs of stabilisation in services are likely to provide more comfort to policymakers after a sister survey last week showed India’s manufacturing expanded at its fastest pace in over eight years, suggesting business conditions were gradually returning to normal in Asia’s third-largest economy.

The Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) bounced to 49.8 in September from August’s 41.8, a touch below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.

But September was the seventh straight month that activity had contracted, the longest such stretch since a 10-month run to early 2014.

50,2020/10/07,Bihar Assembly election | Fewer star campaigners this time,"New norms will apply to Bihar Assembly polls and bypolls across the country

The Election Commission on Wednesday revised norms for star campaigners for polls during the pandemic, reducing the maximum number from 40 to 30 per political party and requiring permission from the district election official 48 hours prior to campaigning.

The new norms will apply to the ongoing Bihar Assembly elections and the bypolls across the country, as well as future elections during the pandemic, the EC said in a letter to the Chief Electoral Officers of all States and Union Territories.

Till now, recognised parties were allowed 40 star campaigners and the unrecognised could have 20. The parties are supposed to submit a list of these campaigners, which usually includes top national leaders and celebrities, to the EC seven days from the date of notification of polls. The amount spent on campaigning by them is not included in the respective candidate’s expenditure.

The EC decided to reduce the number of star campaigners to 30 and 15 each for recognised and unrecognised registered parties respectively, as well give parties 10 days from the date of notification to submit their lists.

“After considering all facts and circumstances emerging due to the pandemic and keeping a balance between the requirement of campaign by the political parties, the Commission has decided to revise the norms,” the EC letter stated.

“The request for permission for the campaigning by star campaigners shall be submitted to the district election authorities at least 48 hours before the start of campaign so that all necessary safety measures are put in place by all concerned stakeholders well in time,” the letter said.

The EC had announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections on September 25 and visited the State to review preparations from September 29 to October 1.

“The Commission was informed that the district authorities have completed the identification of locations for electoral campaign and are in the process of marking it for public gathering, keeping COVID safety norms in view, in each constituency...” the letter said about the visit by Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora and Election Commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bihar-assembly-election-fewer-star-campaigners-this-time/article32797751.ece

The Congress on Wednesday alleged that the Yogi Adityanath government has been slapping sedition charges after the Hathras gang rape incident as if it were “pickpocketing” charges and asserted no government ever in the past has invoked sedition charges after a rape case as the Uttar Pradesh government has done.

Addressing a virtual press conference, senior party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Abhishek Singhvi said the response of the Yogi government to the Hathras incident has been ‘bizzare’ as it has been coming up with a number of conspiracy theories.

Hathras | U.P. government extends time for submitting SIT report by 10 days

Mr. Singhvi’s comments came on a day when the U.P. government has slapped sedition charges against a journalist of a Kerala-based website, along with three others, after arresting him while he was on his way to Hathras to cover the incident.

The Congress MP claimed that with over 21 FIRs filed against various people on conspiracy charges, such cases outnumber the cases against the main accused in the gang-rape incident.

On Monday, the Yogi Adityanath government alleged that an international conspiracy was being hatched to destabilise his government’s tough posture against the anti-CAA [Citizenship Amendment Act] protests.

Editorial | Grapes of wrath

“In 73-odd years of our Independence, after a rape and murder charge, I don’t know of a single case of any government, including BJP governments, that has come out with 12 or 13 bizarre reasons and invoked sedition charges and done it qua journalists,” Mr. Singhvi said

“What does it amount to? Please see the repercussions of this…In a democracy, the right to speak up is a basic right but if I speak up, I will be charged with sedition. They are invoking sedition as if they were pickpocketing charges,” he said.

54,2020/10/07,FIR against 2 Jaipur journalists in phone tapping case,"On charges of spreading rumours on alleged episode of phone tapping of Congress MLAs during political crisis

Police have registered a case against two journalists based in Jaipur on charges of circulating rumours through their reports on an alleged episode of phone tapping of the Congress MLAs, who were shifted to Jaisalmer during the political crisis two months ago. The turmoil ended with the Congress government winning a confidence vote in the Assembly on August 14.

The First Information Report, registered in the Vidhayakpuri police station here, has named Lokendra Singh, who runs an independent new agency, and Sharat Kumar, State Editor of a television news channel, as the accused. Mr. Singh's news agency also has the contract for news coverage of Sachin Pilot, who was sacked as Deputy Chief Minister and Pradesh Congress Committee president during the crisis.

The case has been registered on the complaint of an officer of the cybercrime police station, who said that the allegations of phone tapping were wrong and the publicising of “false information” through social media and news channel, also followed later by some newspapers, amounted to an offence involving the intent to cause fear in the public.

Probe demand by BJP

While the MLAs supporting Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot were shifted to a resort near Jaisalmer for protection against the horse-trading attempts, the Pilot camp alleged on August 7 that the phones of some of the legislators were being tapped with the involvement of senior police officers. Though the Police Department denied the allegations, the Opposition BJP had demanded a probe into the episode.

The FIR, registered about two months after the incident, has booked the two journalists under Sections 505(1)(b) (circulating report with intent to cause fear or alarm), 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code as well as Section 76 (confiscation of computer on contravention of law) of the Information Technology Act.

Mr. Singh told The Hindu on Wednesday that the police recorded his statement in connection with the incident at Mr. Pilot’s residence on August 20. “After the registration of the FIR, I have now been summoned for questioning at the police station on Thursday. Police have asked me to bring along my mobile phone and computer which I use for my professional services,” he stated.

‘Repressive measures’

BJP State president Satish Poonia said the criminal case had depicted “repressive measures” of the Gehlot government against the fourth pillar of democracy. “The underlying reason lies in the voice raised by journalists in support of underprivileged sections and helpless women,” he stated.

The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) has termed the case an attack on freedom of speech and the journalists’ right to privacy. PUCL-Rajasthan president Kavita Srivastava demanded that the government close the FIR, come clean on phone tapping and ensure that the political and bureaucratic executive did not misuse their position.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fir-against-2-jaipur-journalists-in-phone-tapping-case/article32797135.ece

57,2020/10/07,"Poorest households most in need often left out of PDS, finds study","Analysis of NFHS-4 data finds skewed distribution of BPL cards that provide access to various welfare schemes, including food ration

A first-ever study on the linkages between the availability of PDS (public distribution system) ration and the prevalence of malnutrition finds that the poorest households most in need of free food grains are often left out of the scheme.

The study is authored by Basant K. Panda, Sanjay K. Mohanty, Itishree Nayak and Vishal Dev Shastri from the International Institute of Population Science in Mumbai, and Subramanian S.V. from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. Titled ‘Malnutrition and poverty in India: does the use of public distribution system matter?’, the study was published in BioMed Central’s Nutrition Journal last week.

The study uses National Family Health Survey-4 data for its analysis and finds skewed distribution of BPL (below poverty line) cards used to provide access to various welfare schemes, including food ration. According to the study, an estimated 15% of the households are classified as ‘real poor’ (economically poor and have a welfare card); 16% as ‘excluded poor’ (economically poor but don’t have a BPL card); 23% as privileged ‘non-poor’ (economically non-poor but have welfare card); and 46% as ‘non-poor’ (economically non-poor who don’t have a welfare card).

Out of the total households, 57% of poor households with PDS and without PDS had at least one stunted child, while 43% among non-poor households with PDS and 36% among the non-poor households without PDS had at least one stunted child.

An estimated 48% of children from poor households with PDS; 47% from poor households with no PDS; 35% from non-poor households with PDS; and 29% from non-poor households without PDS were underweight.

“Reduction of child nutrition was not in the ambit of the PDS. We investigated to understand the impact and found a mixed result. Since, PDS cards are given largely to poor people, it is no surprise to see high stunting and [the presence of] underweight [persons] among these real poor. There is no difference in stunting and [the presence of] underweight [children] among the children from real poor and excluded poor, while the excluded poor are deprived of subsidised benefits. Thus, excluded poor should be included in the safety network. Thirdly, the State patterns are mixed. In many States, the odds of stunting among the excluded poor are higher than [in the] real poor,” Basant Kumar Panda replied over e-mail to a question on why there was high prevalence of malnutrition among poor households that were provided PDS rations.

The study also highlights variations in the distribution of BPL cards and asset deprivation across various States. It states: “Though the economically poor States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand had a higher proportion of ‘asset deprived and had welfare card’, the exclusion of ‘welfare card among asset poor’ was also large in these States. For example, in the State of Uttar Pradesh, around 27% of households were asset deprived and did not have the welfare card, while it was 15% in Bihar and 21% in Jharkhand. In a similar line, the States Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, the largest share of the non-poor households had welfare cards.”

The study concludes that the poorest of the poor most in need of welfare schemes are not being covered by them. It recommends improved coverage to ensure poor households are given priority and included in welfare schemes to ensure universal access to food. It also calls for a need to improve the quality of nutritious food under the PDS, and the widening of the food basket to help reduce malnutrition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article13965411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Malnourished.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/poorest-households-most-in-need-often-left-out-of-pds-finds-study/article32796354.ece

“We have rejected the invitation extended by Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal to several members of different outfits for the conference.

Bollywood actor Payal Ghosh on Wednesday met Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy and sought speedy justice, in the wake of her allegation of sexual misconduct against filmmaker Anurag Kashyap.

Met up with Shri G. Krishan Reddy who is the MOS of @AmitShah ji at @HMOIndia and also the minister of state of home ministry and had a very fruitful and forwarded conversation on the issue. It’s an issue faced by many and now is the time to act (sic), she tweeted.

The meeting came about a fortnight after the Mumbai Police registered an FIR against Kashyap following Ms. Ghosh’s accusation that he had sexually assaulted her in 2013.

The filmmaker has dismissed the allegations as baseless.

Before meeting the Union Minister, Ms. Ghosh told reporters that she has come to seek speedy justice .

I will ask for intervention of the Home Ministry, if required. I have already met the NCW (National Commission for Women), she said.

Ms. Ghosh, however, did not speak to journalists after meeting the minister.

She had also tweeted in the morning: I am heading to @HMOIndia to meet the officials. It’s a fight to the end and no fake agenda can deter me. Bring it on. #LetTruthComeOut .

The FIR was registered under the Indian Penal Code Sections 376 (I) (rape), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement), police had said.

In her complaint, the actor had alleged that Mr. Kashyap had raped her at a place on Yari Road in Versova in 2013.

Mr. Kashyap vehemently denied the actor’s allegation and termed it as an attempt to silence him for his outspoken views.

He has also said that at the time of the alleged incident, he was in Sri Lanka and that he was actively pursuing legal options.

Mr. Kashyap’s lawyer Priyanka Khimani said on October 2: “Mr. Kashyap has categorically denied that any such alleged incident ever took place and has also denied all allegations levelled against him”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/p20x2p/article32727355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30thoped-leadGBM7Q9N1D4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/actor-payal-ghosh-meets-mos-home-after-accusing-filmmaker-anurag-kashyap-of-sexual-assault/article32795524.ece

62,2020/10/07,Sushant Singh Rajput’s family writes to CBI alleging ‘unprofessional conduct’ by AIIMS doctor Sudhir Gupta,"Sushant Singh Rajput’s family wrote to the CBI on October 7 alleging “unprofessional conduct” by AIIMS doctor Sudhir Gupta in leaking a forensic report of the late actor and sought a new panel for fair and proper assessment of his death.

The letter, sent through advocate Varun Singh, claimed that the leaked report, if correct, amounts to drawing a biased and boastful conclusion from insufficient evidence.

“I have been reading in the media about the report submitted by AIIMS to CBI with regard to the opinion expressed by CBI in the matter of the death of Sushant Singh Rajput on the June 14, 2020. I have also seen some doctors who were part of the AIIMS Team come on TV and make statements with regard to the forensic examination done by the team,” Mr. Varun Singh said.

The letter, settled by Rajput’s family lawyer, senior advocate Vikas Singh, stated that in spite of repeated efforts to get a copy of the report, there has been no response by Mr. Gupta.

The family has objected to the AIIMS report saying that Gupta-headed forensic team was not submitting a post-mortem report but was only to expressing its opinion on the findings of Cooper Hospital in Mumbai.

“Gupta has been giving media interviews about the sensitive case right from day one, questioning the Doctors of Cooper Hospital for dubious autopsy and Maharashtra Police for hurried post-mortem and contamination and non-preservation of scene of crime,” the letter said, adding that there were several infirmities in the post-mortem report done at the Cooper Hospital.

Pointing infirmities, the letter said the post-mortem was done at night without there being any order of the Magistrate and the protocol was not followed as opined by several experts of forensic departments from all over the world.

“The videography of the post-mortem was not done. Sufficient viscera was not retained for future examination. The time of the death was not mentioned in the post-mortem report. The injuries on the body were not specified and thus there was no opinion expressed of the cause of such injuries.

“The leg which was fractured was not mentioned in the report. There were several other infirmities which could be pointed out by a genuine forensic examination but somehow the same have been left out by the AIIMS team as expressed by one of the doctors in his interview telecast by a TV channel,” the letter alleged.

It contended that Mr. Gupta recently got the incriminating content of the report, submitted to the CBI, leaked selectively to a couple of media houses, and irresponsibly commenting that the death of Sushant is conclusively a case of suicide and there is no foul play.

Editorial | Something rotten: On Sushant Singh Rajput death and the media mob

“Clearly the said leak is aimed at creating doubts in the mind of people, bailing out agencies who have not done their job as per rules and standard protocols, benefitting the culprits and derailing the course of ongoing investigation.

“The conduct of Dr. Sudhir Gupta is unethical, unprofessional, in contravention of government service conduct rules and MCI guidelines. This criminal misadventure on his part has undermined public trust in a premier institution like AIIMS. It has created doubts in the minds of millions of people about the fairness of investigation,” the letter said.

It said the forensic team of AIIMS has not given a categorical opinion on the flaws of the post-mortem done at the Cooper Hospital and have given a report which they were not supposed to do.

Therefore, the matter needs to be referred to another forensic team to be constituted by the CBI by picking up some of the best names in the field from different hospital so that a fair and proper assessment takes place, the letter said.

The AIIMS report, if at all, could have only specified the cause of death i.e. by hanging and could not have gone to say that it is a case of suicide because that is something which only the CBI can decide after a complete investigation in the matter.

The letter said that the CBI may also inquire into the circumstances that led Mr. Gupta to indulge in such unprofessional conduct that threatens to jeopardise the course of investigation and help wrong-doers escape the clutches of law.

The AIIMS medical board has ruled out murder in the death of Rajput and termed it “a case of hanging and death by suicide”, the Premier institute’s forensic chief Mr. Gupta said on October 3.

Rajput, 34, who made his silver screen debut in the critically acclaimed “Kai Po Che” seven years ago, was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14.

India and Japan on Wednesday welcomed the finalisation of the text of a cybersecurity agreement that will promote cooperation in key areas such as 5G network and Artificial Intelligence.

The announcement on the agreement followed the 13th India-Japan Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue between External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and his Japanese counterpart Motegi Toshimitsu in Tokyo.

“The two ministers... welcomed the finalisation of the text of the cybersecurity agreement. The agreement promotes cooperation in capacity building, research and development, security and resilience in the areas of Critical Information Infrastructure, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), among others”, a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said. It, however, did not clarify what role each country would play under this agreement.

The announcement is expected to draw the attention of the stakeholders in the Indian 5G sector as it gets ready to open up for international operators and especially since there is lack of clarity on possible participation of Chinese technology majors in the 5G arena.

COVID-19 challenges

The two Ministers also exchanged ideas on regional and global issues of “mutual interest and agreed that the strong and enduring partnership between the two countries will play a pivotal role in overcoming challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic”.

The ongoing military tension along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh was expected to feature in the talks but the official statements did not elaborate on that point.

The Ministers reiterated that the Indo-Pacific region has become more important in the current global circumstances, and reaffirmed similarities in their vision. The Japanese Foreign Minister highlighted the 50 billion Yen emergency assistance loan and a 1 billion Yen grant for provision of medical support to India that will help India fight COVID-19. He also raised the issue of abduction of Japanese nationals by North Korea and asked for early resolution of the issue. Mr. Jaishankar's conveyed India’s support to finding a closure to the issue.

66,2020/10/07,Rahul Gandhi quotes Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz to target Modi govt over “politics of division”,"My life’s purpose is to bring people of all faiths together, tweets former Congress president

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday quoted Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz to target the Narendra Modi government for pursuing “politics of division” and asserted that his life’s mission was to bring people of all faiths together.

“I agree. My life’s purpose is to bring people of all faiths together in this land,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted and tagged a news report on his Twitter handle, in which it mentioned that Professor Stiglitz advised the Modi government to get rid of its “politics of division”.

“I will start by trying to create an inclusive society. Politics of division is an antithesis of what needs to be done. Modi has tried to divide your country, Moslems against Hindus, and that is going to undermine your society and economy no matter what else happens. This fundamental division will weaken India forever,” the news report quoted Prof Stiglitz as saying in a webinar hosted by the business chamber, FICCI, on Tuesday.

In a separate tweet, the former Congress chief asked Mr. Modi to “ break his silence and face questions as the country wants to ask several questions”.

He also shared a video clip of his Monday’s press conference in Patiala, in which he targeted Mr. Modi over a range of issues: from the Prime Minister’s silence on Hathras gang rape incident to not speaking up against alleged Chinese occupation of Indian territory to ignoring early warnings about COVID-19‘s impact on India’s economy.

67,2020/10/07,78 additional special trains to be run,"IRCTC’s Tejas ‘corporate trains’ to resume services from Oct 17

The Ministry to Railways has decided to run 78 additional trains, taking the total number of special passenger ones operational in the country to 388.

In a notification to all the zones, the railways have asked that 39 pairs of trains, mainly including the AC Express, Duronto, Vande Bharat, Rajdhani and the Shatabdis, “should be introduced as special trains from an early convenient date”.

A railways spokesperson clarified that these trains were separate from the about 200 festive passenger trains that they planned to run between October 15 and November 30 to cater to the festive season demand.

IRCTC to restart 2 Tejas Exp.

Meanwhile, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) announced plans to restart two corporate-run trains -- the Lucknow-New Delhi Tejas Express and the Ahmedabad-Mumbai Tejas Express from October 17, nearly seven months after the operations were suspended owing to the pandemic.

IRCTC said this was being done to cater to the growing passenger demand due to the festive season.

Every alternate seat would be kept vacant to ensure the social distancing norm and passengers would not be allowed to exchange their seats once seated. Additionally, use of face covers/masks would be mandatory for passengers and staff.

“All travellers will install the ‘Arogya Setu’ app and the same will be shown as and when demanded. Detailed instructions will be given to the passengers at the time of booking of tickets,” IRCTC said.

The company’s shares closed lower by 0.39% or Rs5.30/share on the BSE at Rs1,358.05 per share.

‘Covid-19 protection kit’

All passengers would be provided a ‘Covid-19 protection kit’ that would comprise a hand sanitizer, a mask, a face shield and a pair of gloves. All would go through thermal screening and hand sanitisation before entering the coach.

“On getting approval from the Ministry of Railways to restart the operation of the two popular corporate trains, IRCTC is making all-round preparations to ensure that the trains, once started, match the expectation of people in terms of levels of services and safety and health protocols amidst the ongoing pandemic,” IRCTC stated.

The coaches, including the pantry areas and lavatories, would be thoroughly disinfected at regular intervals, along with luggage and baggage of the passengers, frequently touched surfaces inside the coach and the service trays and trolleys.

IRCTC said it had conducted an extensive training programme to educate and train the employees of Tejas trains to manage the operations and provide services according to the ‘New Normal’ amid the pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6n3995/article31965241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2TH-TEJASs,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/irctcs-tejas-corporate-trains-to-resume-services-from-oct-17/article32790019.ece
68,2020/10/07,Public places cannot be occupied indefinitely: Supreme Court,"Blocking of road by Shaheen Bagh protesters unacceptable, says a Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday found the indefinite “occupation” of a public road by the Shaheen Bagh protestors unacceptable.

The court said the protest, considered an iconic dissent mounted by mothers, children and senior citizens of Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), became inconvenient to commuters.

The 13-page judgment upheld the right to peaceful protest against a law but made it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied, and that too indefinitely.

“Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone. The present case was not even one of protests taking place in an undesignated area, but was a blockage of a public way which caused grave inconvenience to commuters”, Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who authored the verdict for a three-judge Bench, observed.

The court suggested that the outcry may have even gone out of hand for the women protesters. It referred to reports about how women were ensconced inside a tent while a “huge periphery” of “male protesters, volunteers and bystanders”, who wanted the blockade to continue, milled around.

Book review | A million Shaheen Baghs

While the tent occupied half the road, the other half was blocked by a three-dimensional map of India, a large model of India Gate and even a library. Factors like the absence of leadership and many “influencers” and groups working at cross-purposes saw the movement slip out of the hands of the women of Shaheen Bagh.

“Thus, the Shaheen Bagh protest perhaps no longer remained the sole and empowering voice of women, who also appeared to no longer have the ability to call off the protest themselves. There was also the possibility of the protesters not fully realising the ramifications of the pandemic, coupled with a general unwillingness to relocate to another site”, the court observed.

‘Leaderless’ dissent

It later noted that Shaheen Bagh seemed typical of the many digitally-fuelled “leaderless” dissent seen in modern times. Technology and social media could both empower and weaken mass movements.

“The ability to scale up quickly, for example, using digital infrastructure has empowered movements to embrace their often-leaderless aspirations and evade the usual restrictions of censorship. However, the flip side is that social media channels are often fraught with danger and can lead to the creation of highly polarised environments, which often see parallel conversations running with no constructive outcome evident”, Justice Kaul ruminated.

It was finally the gaining pandemic, which intervened like the “hand of God”, that led the protesters to relent and end the blockade, the court said. They were removed by the police from the site on March 24.

The seeds of protest and dissent were sown deep during the Freedom struggle. But dissent against the colonial rule cannot be equated with dissent in a self-ruled democracy, Justice Kaul reasoned.

In a democracy, the rights of free speech and peaceful protest were indeed “treasured”. They were to be encouraged and respected, the court said.

Reasonable restrictions

But these rights were also subject to reasonable restrictions imposed in the interest of sovereignty, integrity and public order. Police regulations also weighed in.

‘Fundamental rights do not live in isolation. The right of the protester has to be balanced with the right of the commuter. They have to co-exist in mutual respect’.

Comment | The victory of the Shaheen Bagh women

The judgment, based on a petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni, said the Delhi High Court should have intervened positively and not left the situation fluid. The administration too should have talked to the protesters.

“Unfortunately, despite a lapse of a considerable period of time, there was neither any negotiations nor any action by the administration, thus warranting our intervention,"" the Supreme Court observed.

The court held it was entirely the responsibility of the administration to prevent encroachments in public spaces. They should do so without waiting for courts to pass suitable orders.

“The courts are not meant to give shoulder to the administration to fire their guns from,” Justice Kaul observed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mte5j4/article31457623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THRDSHAHEEN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shaheen-bagh-protest-occupying-public-places-for-protests-not-acceptable-says-sc/article32789318.ece

72,2020/10/07,ED arrests ex-CFO of Cox & Kings and auditor,"According to the ED, the money laundering probe revealed that the Cox and Kings group had an outstanding of ₹3,642 crore towards Yes Bank.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has arrested Anil Khandelwal, former chief financial officer of Cox & Kings Limited (CKL), and its internal auditor, Naresh Jain, in connection with the Yes Bank case. The agency has got their seven-day custody.

According to the ED, the money laundering probe revealed that the Cox and Kings group had an outstanding of ₹3,642 crore towards Yes Bank. The group allegedly fabricated its consolidated financials by manipulating the balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries.

Some board resolutions submitted to banks for sanctioning the loans were also found to be forged. Yes Bank gave loans in violation of the norms, at the instance of its then chairman-cum-managing director, Rana Kapoor, it is alleged.

“During 2015-19, sales of ₹3,908 crore was made to 15 non-existent/fictitious customers. A majority of collection shown in ledgers from a CKG entity, Ezeego, was not found in the bank statements. There are fictitious 15 high-value debtors reflected in the books of accounts. Another 147 sets of customers also appeared to be suspicious and non-existent,” said an ED official.

The agency alleges that CKL diverted ₹1,100 crore to another stressed company, without any approval of the board, which had no business relationship with it.

“During the whole process, Mr. Khandelwal and Mr. Jain acquired mortgaged property amounting to ₹63 crore in their owned business entity, Reward Business Solutions, without paying a single penny from their pocket,” the official said. The accused also bought various immovable properties from the diverted funds.

The agency said that from Ezeego, ₹150 crore were diverted to Redkite Capital Private Limited, which was promoted by Mr. Khandelwal’s family members. “Investigations conducted so far has revealed that the bank transactions of the Cox and Kings Group are not matching with the books of accounts...,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6nhzp6/article32641827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-ED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-arrests-ex-cfo-of-cox-kings-and-auditor/article32787305.ece
73,2020/10/07,NHRC issues advisories on protection of human rights during pandemic,"It requests Ministries, States and UTs to submit action-taken reports

The National Human Rights Commission on Tuesday said it had issued advisories to the Ministries concerned for protecting the rights of informal workers, prisoners and police personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The NHRC had set up a committee of experts to look into the impact of the pandemic on human rights in various sectors. On Monday, it sent the advisories for businesses to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, for prisoners and police personnel to the Ministry of Home Affairs and for informal workers to the Labour Ministry. They were also sent to the Chief Secretaries of all States and Union Territories.

In a statement on Tuesday, the NHRC said it had requested the Ministries, States and UTs to implement the recommendations and submit action-taken reports.

On the rights of informal workers, the NHRC recommended the State governments to set up worker facilitation centres at the district and city-level for registering all of them, providing information regarding welfare schemes and job opportunities and skill-mapping. It also said every migrant worker returning to their home districts should be provided MGNREGA job cards. The advisory said an urban employment guarantee programme should be considered.

“The Central government shall advise all State governments against dilution of labour laws,” the advisory said, in an apparent reference to the move by many States to suspend or dilute them during the pandemic.

The advisory said the cases registered against migrant workers for violating lockdown guidelines “may be dropped” and those arrested “must be released immediately”. The advisory included measures to be taken for the protection of rights of tribal communities, sex workers, ASHA workers, workers with disabilities and sanitation workers.

On the advisory for prisoners and police, the NHRC said inmates should be provided with food to increase immunity, healthcare and testing. With regard to the police, the advisory said the pandemic had had a profound effect on first responders. Over 1.24 lakh police personnel had contracted the virus as on September 28, it said. The advisory said police personnel carrying out arrests should wear masks and gloves, and traffic police should avoid lengthy conversations with motorists. It also included advice on mental health issues that could crop in the police force, recommending a “well-being programme” with yoga, deep breathing, nutritional counselling.

In the advisory to businesses, the NHRC recommended that companies that are badly affected by the crisis should be allowed to adjust expenditure on salaries against their corporate social responsibility obligations for two years starting 2021-2022.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/27pguj/article32674883.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MIGRANTWORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nhrc-issues-advisories-on-protection-of-human-rights-during-pandemic/article32787299.ece

76,2020/10/07,"Economy on recovery path, says Nirmala Sitharaman","Feedback from industrialists has been positive: Minister

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday that the economy was on the path to recovery, going by the feedback she received from the States about the positivity in some high-frequency indicators and from industrialists who told her they had almost reached the pre-COVID capacity utilisation levels.

Addressing the media here, she said the GST Council had decided that the compensation cess collection could go beyond the five years transition period originally proposed.

Revenue deficit grant

On the Andhra Pradesh government’s demand for revenue deficit grant, she said it had to be discussed as it was a matter in the purview of the 14th Finance Commission whose term had expired.

“The Ministry of Finance has to work on it, considering that the amount being claimed by the State is based on the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission. The 15th Finance Commission has already submitted its first year’s report and it is under implementation,” Ms. Sitharaman observed while addressing the media here.

She avoided a firm reply to a question on the demand for Special Category Status (SCS), saying she would answer if she had one.

On the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation), Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Acts, 2020, she said farmers were happy that certain taxes that cut into their meagre returns were eliminated and inter-State trade was made hassle-free.

Criticises Opposition

The Centre did not meddle with the Agricultural Produce Market Committees, which were the domain of the States, and it was not going about contact farming in a roughshod manner lest the relevant laws should become counterproductive.

The Opposition parties, she said, were doing politics as usual after wasting an opportunity to engage with the government in a meaningful debate in Parliament.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/36umkr/article32797202.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08VJPG4-SITHARAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aps-demand-for-revenue-deficit-grant-has-to-be-discussed-nirmala-sitharaman/article32797203.ece

79,2020/10/07,‘Man behind troll’ on idol desecration held,"He was charged with making a false social media post

Amid the disturbing trend of viral posts trolling on some unconfirmed incidents of desecration of idols, the Guntur Rural Police have busted a social media troll over an alleged incident that took place in Narsaraopet.

Within hours of a post that talked about an alleged desecration of a Saraswati idol on the premises of Krishnaveni College in Narsaraopet, the police tracked the origin of the post and nabbed a person from Piduguralla.

Addressing mediapersons, Superintendent of Police, Guntur Rural, Vishal Gunni said a message on the WhatsApp number of an Inspector at Piduguralla on the alleged incident prompted the police into the action immediately. The Inspector, after sensing that some thing was amiss, forwarded the message to Inspector of Narsaraopet, who then went to the college.

It had emerged that the site had been leased out to Krishnaveni College some 10 years back and it was during the renovation/construction of new buildings taken up two years back, that the idol was partially damaged.

The Inspector then started investigation and it led to a man in Piduguralla, who reportedly admitted that he had forwarded a message he received on his mobile phone.

“We are sounding a note of caution to people. These days, when usage of mobile phones has increased considerably, we urge people to be very careful while dealing with messages that can cause communal tension and create hatred among communities. Even if they innocuously forward such messages which can foment communal hatred, they are liable to be punished under the relevant sections of law,’’ said Mr. Gunni.

Further, Mr. Gunni said that 4,300 religious places had been thoroughly searched across Guntur Rural district in view of the incidents across the State. “Such incidents appear to be the handiwork of some miscreants or a group, bent on creating a law and order problems in the State and the police will crack down mercilessly on such elements,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3cgz4h/article32797009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08VJGUNTUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/man-behind-troll-on-idol-desecration-held/article32797010.ece

P. Urmila Gajapathi Raju, second daughter of former MANSAS Trust chairperson P. Ananda Gajapathi Raju strongly opposed the proposal to privatise of the Maharaja College (MR College) which was established by P. Vijaya Rama Gajapathi Raju-III, the then king of Vijayanagaram princely state in 1879.

Addressing the media, along with her mother Sudha Gajapathi Raju, second wife of Ananda Gajapathi Raju, here on Tuesday, Ms. Urmila urged the State government not to accept the privatisation proposals reportedly mooted by the present chairman of MANSAS Trust and her sister, P. Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju.

Removal of employees

Ms. Sanchaita is the daughter of Uma Gajapathi Raju, who took a divorce from Ananda Gajapathi Raju almost three decades ago. Later, Ananda Gajapathi Raju married Ms. Sudha Gajapathi Raju. Ms. Urmila, who has recently returned from the U.K. after completion of her higher studies, also opposed the reported removal of many employees from various educational institutions and offices of the MANSAS Trust.

Jagan Mohan Reddy to explain about our legitimate rights in the Trust and seek his intervention to protect MR College,” said Ms. Urmila.

88,2020/10/07,VPT has done well in traffic handling despite pandemic: Chairman,"‘The second container terminal project may be completed in a year’

The Visakhapatnam Port Trust has finished the first half of this financial year with a marginal decline of traffic volume by only 5.7% with even as the coronavirus pandemic has an adverse impact on the economy, VPT Chairman K. Ram Mohana Rao has said.

“The decline in traffic volume is much less than that of all major ports put together in the first six months of the current fiscal year. The VPT handled 32.77 million tonnes of traffic when compared to 34.75 MT in the corresponding period last financial year,” Mr. Ram Mohana Rao told the media here on Tuesday. He attributed it to the dedication and teamwork of all officers, staff and workers of the put VPT, saying that they have put in their 100% efforts, despite the pandemic threat.

The decline in handling of some commodities was partially compensated by the improvement in the handling of other commodities.

The decline in cargo volume was in respect of the raw material for power sector (steam coal), steel sector (coking coal), petroleum sector (crude oil) and container cargo (import) due the global economic slowdown induced by the pandemic, Mr. Ram Mohana Rao said. The VPT, he said, achieved a significant growth in respect of handling iron ore and pellets, coastal export of thermal coal to the TANGEDCO, fertilizers, finished steel and container exports. The growth in handling iron ore was due to the increase in imports by China due to the decline in production in Australia and Brazil. Finished steel growth volume went up owing to the good demand from China, South Korea and Japan. The growth in fertilizer volume was due to the efforts of the VPT and container exports grew due to increase in agri products.

He said a second container terminal project, undertaken at an estimated cost of ₹633 crore, is expected to be completed in a year.

Ammonium nitrate import

Mr. Ram Mohan Rao explained that the VPT was designated to handle fertilizer grade of ammonium nitrate in ‘bagged form’ and imports were being allowed strictly on the basis of the necessary clearances. A 29-point checklist has been prepared by the VPT and it is being followed strictly by the importers.

Referring to the Major Ports Authority Bill-2020, the VPT Chairman said that it would provide the much-needed autonomy to the ports for effective utilisation of their assets. It would also increase the competition and promote efficiency. The VPT has initiated several measures to improve handling through mechanisation and offering competitive rates further.

Upcoming projects

The VPT is planning to make the existing four-lane road from the Convent Junction to Sheelanagar into a six-lane one. to ease traffic congestion. The estimated project cost has been put at ₹35 crore. Other upcoming projects include the mechanisation of three berths, a modern truck terminal and an additional oil handling facility by revamping the two existing oil berths, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/u1lszz/article32786876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07ONG5VPT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vpt-has-done-well-in-traffic-handling-despite-pandemic-chairman/article32786877.ece

Visakhapatnam West MLA P.G.V.R. Naidu (Ganababu), TDP leaders and former Ministers Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy and Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu and BJP leader and former MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju lashed out at the State government for failing to allot the houses built for the poor by the previous government.

Addressing separate media conferences here on Tuesday, they said that the beneficiaries were selected by following the due process. The beneficiaries had also paid the price fixed for the houses. They alleged that the YSR Congress Party government was not interested in handing over the houses constructed by the previous government as the beneficiaries would support the TDP in the next elections. In letters to the Chief Minister and the Minister for Housing and Municipal Administration,Mr. Ganababu noted that the beneficiaries had paid the DDs for the three types of houses available under the scheme. The houses were constructed on government lands by Tata Housing and the allotments were done through a lottery held under the auspices of the GVMC Commissioner.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to allocate the houses free of cost during his election tour. He had even declared that the DD s would be returned to the beneficiaries. But, now the government was saying that the beneficiaries would be selected afresh. This was creating distress among the beneficiaries.

The statements of the GVMC Commissioner were creating unrest among the 40,000 beneficiaries. He demanded that the Chief Minister come out with a proper statement on the issue.

Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy explained that the TDP government had obtained permission for construction of 52,000 houses in the first phase in Visakhapatnam district. As many as 22,000 houses were almost completed barring finishing works like sanitary fittings.

The beneficiaries had paid ₹43 crore to the GVMC. Of this, ₹9 crore was paid by the corporation to the State government and the balance amount was with the corporation. The State government could have completed the remaining houses with the money and allotted them to the beneficiaries. The TDP leader said that he would approach the High Court for justice to the beneficiaries.

Mr. Vishnu Kumar Raju said it was wrong to cancel the allotments already done. The contractors, who had taken up the works under PMAY, were small contractors and their dues have been pending for 16 months. He appealed to the Chief Minister not to do injustice to the beneficiaries.

Party Parliamentary District president M. Raveendra said it was wrong to cancel the allotments made in the past.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/allot-houses-built-for-the-poor-tdp-bjp/article32786864.ece

93,2020/10/07,"Minister Jayaram involved in land scam, alleges Ayyanna","He wants CM to recomend a CBI probe into the allegations

TDP leader Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu has alleged that Minister for Labour G. Jayaram indulged in land irregularities involving a few hundred acres in Kurnool district.

“The Minister hatched a plan to grab 450 acres belonging to a private company and has got 203 acres registered on benami names. He got fake documents prepared to show that the land was purchased from Manjunadh, a former director of the private company,” Mr. Patrudu told the media here on Tuesday. The Bengaluru-based company had lodged a police complaint in Karnataka and Majunadh was named accused. Latter, he was granted conditional bail, Mr. Patrudu said and alleged that Mr. Jayaram hatched a conspiracy to grab the land as the company could not start its operations.

“The Minister, after getting 203 acres registered in the names of benamis, used force to threaten farmers in a bid to evict them,” he alleged and demanded that the Chief Minister order a CBI inquiry into allegations of corruption against the Minister.

The silence of the Chief Minister on the allegations would make people suspect his involvement in the scam, he said.

‘Documents forged’

The TDP leader also alleged that the Minister tried to obtain a loan from the District Cooperative Bank with the help of forged land documents, adding that the Minister’s son was gifted a high-end car by an accused in the ESI scam.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8nfa8m/article32786688.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07ONG4AYYANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/minister-jayaram-involved-in-land-scam-alleges-ayyanna/article32786689.ece

Energy Department Secretary Nagulapalli Srikant has said that an energy-efficient industry sector in the State may not be a distant dream, if the industries come forward voluntarily to cooperate with the government to improve the energy efficiency.

Mr. Srikant was speaking at a webinar organised by the Andhra Pradesh State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM), in coordination with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) on implementation of the Perform, Achieve, Trade (PAT) scheme in energy-intensive industries.

“The State government is laying a focus on improving the energy efficiency in industry sector, apart from providing reliable, quality and affordable power to the stakeholders. Efficiency leads to productivity gains by lowering the maintenance costs and increasing production yields per unit of input,” said Mr. Srikant.

He requested all the designated industries to improve their energy efficiency and assured all support from the government.

Annual consumption

Mr. Srikant pointed out that 21 industries had achieved the PAT compliance in the Cycle-1 and saved 2,386 million units of power worth ₹1,600 crore and congratulated them.

“The energy efficiency will help develop the State where the industrial sector is the major consumer of power, with 20,026 million units per annum.

Productivity boost

Energy expert (industry) and BEE Director Ashok Kumar said energy efficiency can contribute to energy security, productivity boost and job creation.

Mr. Ashok Kumar congratulated Mr. Srikant for his role in making the industrial sector energy efficient by implementation of the PAT scheme in the State.

The BEE Director also appreciated the designated consumers (industries) for timely submission of the forms required, Mandatory Energy Audit Report and Monitoring and Verification Report for the Cycle-II of the PAT scheme.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pat-scheme-helps-21-industries-save-power-worth-1600-crore/article32786675.ece
95,2020/10/07,JEE (Advanced) toppers attribute success to hard work and family support,"Jintendra and Gangula Bhuvan Reddy eager to join IIT-Bombay

“The COVID-19 pandemic is a real spoilsport. Or else, I would be celebrating my achievement by hosting a party,” says Landa Jitendra, who secured all-India first rank in the OBC category and 14th rank in the open category in the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Advanced 2020, the results of which were declared on Monday. He secured a score of 318/396.

Speaking to The Hindu from his native village Lavidam in Gurla mandal of Vizianagaram district, Jintendra says the lockdown, which led to the shutdown of the coaching centre, forcing him to stay at home and prepare for the exam, was a major challenge. “There was internet connectivity issue but my parents were a constant support. They would encourage me not to lose heart and be focussed on my preparation,” he said.

His father is into transport business and mother a home-maker. “I dedicated 12 to 13 hours in a day for my preparation and now that I have cracked this exam, I can’t wait to join IIT-Bombay, where I always wanted to be,” says the youngster who wants to be a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a multi-national company.

Gangula Bhuvan Reddy, the All-India second ranker in open category (345/396 marks) is a native of Proddutur in Kadapa district. “I decided to do whatever it takes to secure a good rank in the JEE to bag a seat in IIT-Bombay, one of the premier institutes of the country, when I was in class 9,” he said, informing that he wants to pursue a course in Computer Science and set up his own company some day.

“Based on the answer key, I knew that I would be among the top three. I am slightly disappointed for having missed the first position by a whisker but convinced myself thinking that the first ranker would definitely worked a tad harder than me,” he chuckles. Chirag Falor of Pune bagged the All-India first rank with a score of 352/396.

Both attributed their success to constant hard work, support from people around them and a steely resolve to make it to the top.

Besides the two toppers, four others from the State bagged ranks below 50 and five candidates secured ranks between 50 and 100 in the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) category.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jee-advanced-toppers-attribute-success-to-hard-work-and-family-support/article32786589.ece
96,2020/10/07,Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi gears up for a ‘fight to the finish’,"It chalks out an action plan for State-wide protests on October 11 and 12

State-wide protests and demonstrations on October 11 and 12 will mark the completion of 300 days of the agitation being staged by the farmers and residents of the Amaravati region under the aegis of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi.

The residents of villages in the capital region have been demanding that Amaravati be retained as the single capital of Andhra Pradesh.

A resolution was passed on Tuesday at an all-party meeting organised by the samithi members, and attended by the leaders of various political parties, trade unions, and civil society representatives.

Expressing solidarity with the cause, the leaders from various parties said they were ready for a “fight to the finish” battle.

Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi JAC convener A. Siva Reddy said that a joint action plan was being worked out to ensure that these protests leave a deep impact on all the 13 districts of the State. He criticised the government for “remaining indifferent” to the prolonged protests by the farmers, some of whom had lost their lives fighting for the cause.

“None of the Ministers or MLAs have come to the agitating farmers and women in the capital region,” he said, adding, “instead, women who are agitating peacefully for the cause in Vijayawada city are manhandled and arrested.”

5K walk and webinar

The meeting decided to organise protest rallies (5K walk) in all the 175 constituencies across the State on October 11 (Sunday) from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. followed by a webinar on the subject.

On October 12 (Monday), dharna would be staged at the revenue offices across the State. On October 22, a national webinar of women leaders would mark the completion of five years of the foundation-laying ceremony for Amaravati as the new capital of the State, Mr. Siva Reddy said.

CPI(M) State secretary P. Madhu said the successful completion of 294 days of agitation was a moral victory. He blamed a few leaders at the Centre for the “sorry state of affairs in Amaravati today.”

TDP Polit Bureau member Varla Ramaiah took exception to what he called “arrogant stand of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy” on the key issue.

97,2020/10/07,DGP orders probe into supply of ‘erroneous data’ to NCRB,"Notices issued to the officers and staff of DCRB and CCRB

The police have issued memos to the officers and other staff working in the District Crime Records Bureau (DCRB) of Chittoor and Visakhapatnam Rural districts and the staff working in the Visakhapatnam City Crime Records Bureau (CCRB) for “sending incorrect data” to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

Cases against police

The DCRB and the CCRB officials have allegedly sent “erroneous data” pertaining to the cases booked against the police personnel in their respective jurisdictions.

While the actual figure was only 111, they had sent the number of cases as 1,681, which was incorporated in the 2020 data released by the NCRB.

The Chittoor DCRB had put the number of cases at 409 while the actual figure was only four. The Visakhapatnam Rural police said that 972 cases had been registered while the actual number was only two. Similarly, the Visakhapatnam CCRB had put the number of cases at 257 while the actual was only one.

Director General of Police D. Gautam Sawang has ordered an inquiry into the “negligence of a few officers and staff,” which has damaged the State’s reputation.

‘SCRB too at fault’

Mr. Sawang has also expressed his anger over the Station Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) for forwarding the data without cross-checking the figures with the concerned officers.

“Action will be taken against the negligent staff for sending wrong information to the NCRB,” a senior police officer told The Hindu on Tuesday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dgp-orders-probe-into-supply-of-erroneous-data-to-ncrb/article32786557.ece
98,2020/10/07,DIG urges Naidu not to demoralise police force,"‘TDP president trying to target the police by spreading falsehood’

Leader of the Opposition and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu is trying to target the police by giving false information to the people, Deputy Inspector General of Police (Technical Services) G. Pala Raju has said.

The police were endeavouring to protect the rights of the people round the clock, Mr. Pala Raju told the media at the A.P. Police Headquarters at Mangalagiri on Tuesday.

He alleged that Mr. Naidu had given incorrect information on the Rajamahendravaram and Seethanagaram incidents.

‘Prompt action taken’

The police had arrested three persons in a case of teasing in Rajamahendravaram. Similarly, three persons, who included a Sub-Inspector, had been arrested in the Seethanagaram incident. In the Srikakulam incident, action had been taken against the police officer for thrashing a complainant, Mr. Pala Raju said, and asserted that the police had taken prompt action in all the incidents in accordance with the law.

“Instead of talking about the police initiating action, Mr. Naidu has been writing letters criticising the DGP and demoralising the police in the State. It is not correct to generalise every incident and create panic among the people,” the DIG said.

“Many police personnel are staying away from their families and have been discharging their duties against odds during the pandemic. It is not correct on the part of the Opposition leader to target the police and create demoralise the force,” he said.

“The police are trying to offer better services to the people, protect their rights and provide foolproof security to each and every citizen,” Mr. Pala Raju said, and appealed to Mr. Naidu not to criticise and insult the system.

101,2020/10/07,High Court notice to Registrar-General on students’ plea to use A4 size paper in courts,"The PIL petition was filed by a group of law students.

The High Court of Karnataka has ordered issue of notice to its Registrar-General on a PIL petition filed by a group of law students seeking changes in the court’s rule to allow use of A4 size paper for all court proceedings instead of the existing foolscap or legal size paper.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order on the petition filed by Akriti Agarwal of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, Bhavana M. of Bengaluru, and Lakshya Purohit of Udaipur in Rajasthan.

The petitioners have been campaigning for uniform use of the widely available A4 paper in all the courts across the county, instead of the foolscap or legal size paper, a practice adopted since British rule. They have been also campaigning for printing on both sides of the sheets instead of the practice of allowing printing on only one side of the sheets in some courts.

It was pointed out in the petition that based on their requests, the Supreme Court of India, and the High Courts of Calcutta, Kerala and Tripura, had already modified the norms specifying that A4 sheets should be used for all purposes by courts as well as advocates, besides allowing printing on both sides of the sheets. The petitioners stated that A4 sheets were widely available for common people, whereas the foolscap or legal size paper was available only in shops near courts and hence was not easily accessible.

Printing on both sides would result in use of fewer sheets, and thereby help environment, the petitioners contended. The petition said that the petitioner had written a letter in March 2020 to the Registrar-General of the High Court of Karnataka requesting to change the norm, but no action had been taken so far.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jznmyx/article32799729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-high-court-notice-to-registrar-general-on-students-plea-to-use-a4-size-paper-in-courts/article32797436.ece

The Opposition Congress has fielded veteran leader and former Minister T.B. Jayachandra and political novice Kusuma H., wife of late IAS officer D.K. Ravi, as the party candidates for byelections to Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituencies scheduled on November 3.

Ramesh Babu, former MLC, who recently quit the JD(S) and joined the Congress, is the nominee of the party for the South East Graduates Constituency of the Legislative Council, for which elections will be held on October 28.

Heavy rains accompanied by thunder and lightning lashed Mysuru and surrounding regions on Wednesday evening throwing normal life out of gear.

Though the day began on a normal note with sun breaking through the clouds frequently, it began to drizzle around 6 p.m. and gained in intensity forcing people to scamper for cover.

Karnataka, which has so far hosted 12 editions of Aero India, will host the 13th edition from February 3 to 7, 2021.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa participated in the ambassador’s round table virtual summit on the 13th edition of Aero India, 2021, chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, on Wednesday.

105,2020/10/07,NCPCR’s ‘blanket’ order riles child rights activists,"The national panel has suggested that those in child care institutions be sent to their families or placed for adoption

The recommendation of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) — that all children in need of care and protection who are in child care institutions (CCI) be sent to their families or placed for adoption and foster care — has drawn criticism from various activists, academics, lawyers, organisations and individuals.

The recommendation is applicable to eight States including Karnataka, where the number of CCIs is high. This order does not apply to children who are placed under specialised adoption agencies or children in observation homes. An open letter which has been signed by 517 people and 261 organisations seeks the withdrawal of the letter “in the best interest of children.”

They have argued that a blanket drive like this would lead to “serious violation of human rights of children residing in these institutions and render some more vulnerable than ever before.” It will also amount to complete disregard for the procedures established in law, they have said.

The signatories have said that although they admit that institutionalisation should be the last resort, removing children from institutional care without considering their peculiar circumstances will inevitably push many children into situations of greater risk of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation.

They also point out that this is particularly worrying during the COVID-19 pandemic that has rendered children and their families more vulnerable. “In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, families have been pushed beyond the margins from food security to housing and livelihood, their problems, including mental health challenges, have increased manifold. Restoring children to such a situation without considering the views of the children and their families and without an assessment cannot be in their best interest,” said the letter.

Further, they have also said that the commission by issuing this recommendation to all Deputy Commissioners and District Magistrates has bypassed and undermined the jurisdiction, powers and functions of the Child Welfare Committees established the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

The activists, academics and lawyers have instead recommended that social audit of CCIs should be put on the commission’s website and inputs from different stakeholders including children must be sought to improve the functioning of the child care institutions.

Swagata Raha, consultant, Enfold Proactive Health Trust, said that the decision to restore children to their homes cannot be mechanical one. “Many children do not want to go to their homes because of a reason. The are probably at the risk of facing violence or abuse at home,” she said. Ms. Raha also said that children in child care institutions should be restored only after an inquiry is undertaken by the Child Welfare Committee which is done based on social investigation report, individual care plan and after taking into consideration children’s views and reports prepared by the counsellors, social workers or NGOs who are working with the District Child Protection Units.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ncpcrs-blanket-order-riles-child-rights-activists/article32797262.ece

107,2020/10/07,Golden Chariot to be back on track from January,"Karnataka’s luxury train Golden Chariot is set to chug from January 2021 to cater to travellers in anticipation of a revival of tourism by then.

The Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) is also toying with the idea of introducing a Christmas package provided the COVID-19 situation eases to a significant extent by December.

The circuitous journey of the luxury train came to a grinding halt due to the pandemic in March 2020 and the rakes were grounded following suspension of all travel and tourism activities since then.

But consequent to the graded unlocking, the KSTDC has announced the itinerary for the Golden Chariot starting from January. The itinerary comprises the Pride of Karnataka (six nights), Jewels of Deccan (six nights) and a 3-day package titled Glimpses of Karnataka. The destinations to be covered will include prominent places of tourist interest, including Mysuru, Kabini, Belur-Halebid, Hampi, Badami, Pattadakal, Aihole besides Goa.

Kumar Pushkar, MD, KSTDC, said the bookings are open and the same can be done on the Golden Chariot website. “We have kept the options open to introduce a Christmas package in case the situation eases with respect to the pandemic,” he added. The itinerary of the Christmas package and the costs have not been worked out but it is likely that the same circuit will be marketed with minor modifications to cater to the domestic travellers.

The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Development Corporation (IRCTC) was vested with the task of refurbishing the interiors of the luxury train and they worked on it from January to March this year to complete the task ahead for the 2020 summer itinerary which was suspended due to the pandemic. So when the Golden Chariot chugs again in January, it will be akin to a brand new train with the interiors overhauled, said Mr. Pushkar.

The new makeover and the interiors are said to befit taste of international train travel enthusiasts with new comfort features, including upholstered furniture, elegant drapery, renovated rooms and bathrooms, crockery and cutlery of reputed international brands and fresh linen apart from in-room entertainment with Wi-Fi enabled smart TVs in every cabin.

The vestibules will also be changed to facilitate easy and safe movement of guests from their respective coaches to the restaurant, which will be in the middle of the rake.

Also, the rakes which are stationed at Chickballapur will be moved to the Ashokapuram Railway Workshop in Mysuru for retrofitting of new suspensions and changing the vestibules.

The earlier rakes had spring suspensions that resulted in lot of jerks during the journey and they will be replaced with air suspension which will pave way for smoother travel. “The State government has already paid the railways for change of suspension and it will be completed by December,” Mr. Pushkar added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/golden-chariot-to-be-back-on-track-from-january/article32796137.ece

109,2020/10/07,BJP will win byelections in two Assembly seats: Eshwarappa,"Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa has expressed the confidence of the BJP winning the byelections going to be held in Sira and Rajarajeshwari Nagar Assembly constituencies in the State.

He was talking to reporters in Yadgir on Wednesday.

Mr. Eshwarappa said that the BJP will not worry about candidates contesting from the Congress and other parties. “It is in no way a concern to us (about candidates from other parties). We will surely win the byelections,” he said and added that people of Rajarajeshwari Nagar Assembly constituency will decide about the decision of the Congress giving ticket to Kusuma.

Asked about penalties being imposed on people for not wearing face masks, the Minister said that it was not a question of imposing fine but it is a question of life. “If one is infected, many will be infected. Therefore, the government is imposing fine to create awareness among people about the importance of wearing masks,” he added.

Talking about the Congress, Mr. Eshwarappa said that the people have lost faith in the Congress in the State. Therefore, that party lost 25 seats in the last Parliamentary elections and it will face defeat even in the coming byelections, he said.

He said that Muniratna will get BJP ticket for contesting in the Rajarajeshwari Nagar constituency.

112,2020/10/07,Letter by DCP to Police Commissioner goes viral,"A cold war seems have to broken out between two top officials of the Hubballi Dharwad Police Commissionerate, forcing one of them to write a letter to the other seeking an appointment to discuss official matter, although they work under the same roof.

The letter written by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Krishnakant, sent to the Police Commissioner with a copy to the Director-General and Inspector-General of Police, has gone viral now bringing to the fore the differences within the Police Commissionerate.

The letter clearly indicates that Mr. Krishnakant is upset with the way Police Commissioner of Hubballi Dharwad R. Dileep has behaved with him. In his letter of October 3, sent through the Control Room to the Police Commissioner, Mr. Krishnakant has expressed displeasure over the Police Commissioner not giving him an appointment to meet him and discuss sensitive details pertaining to a case.

According to the letter, repeated attempts to meeting the Police Commissioner have failed. Mr. Krsihnakant has said that phone calls to the Police Commissioner were not answered and were, instead, diverted to subordinates with a message that his calls would be returned, which, however, have not happened so far.

He has in the letter mentioned that he has been deputed on COVID-19-related works and he would not be able to reveal sensitive issues concerning cases over wireless communication and had requested for an appointment to discuss them in person, which, however, has not been met. Meanwhile, both the officials have declined to comment on the issue.

Takes exception

113,2020/10/07,Tribals staring at lack of livelihood opportunities in Mysuru district,"Most of them are unemployed since the last few months

The economic downturn as a fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic and its cascading impact has affected the tribal people in Mysuru district most of whom are unemployed since the last few months.

Though the nutrition aspect has been taken care of through the distribution of ration under various Central and State government schemes, labour opportunities have diminished due to slowdown in economic activity.

While it is mandatory for the authorities to ensure that they are given employment for at least 100 days in an year under the MGNREGA, not many are benefiting, according to M.B. Prabhu, a tribal rights activist functioning from Veeranahosahalli in Hunsur. “There are hundreds of Jenu Kurubas, Betta Kurubas, Soligas and Yeravas without jobs in Hunsur, Periyapatana, H.D. Kote belt’’, he added.

A majority of them used to be employed in the plantation sector in Kodagu. But the region is under distress due to the pandemic and the repeated floods that hit the district for three consecutive years.

’Earlier, the labour contractors used to transport tribals from Veeranhosahalli and surrounding villages to coffee plantations in Kodagu and this was a major source of livelihood for the tribal community. But the fear of the pandemic has put an end to the free movement of labour and has rendered the tribals unemployed’’, said Mr. Prabhu.

Though the local agricultural activity has provided employment and helped a section of the tribals to sustain themselves for a few weeks, the plantations in Kodagu were the main source of employment for the community and that has been affected this year, said S. Sreekanth of Development through Education, an NGO fighting for tribal rights.

“Plantations in Kodagu used to provide sustenance from December to April/May but the lockdown this year dashed all the prospects’’, he added.

Bulk of job creation under MGNREGA is for desilting of lakes and water bodies during summer. But all the waterbodies were full during summer early this year due to heavy rains last year and hence no work could be taken up.

In case of tribals who tilled their land and cultivated maize, none of them received remunerative rates as the crop was sold to middlemen for half the market rates in the absence of any institutional mechanism to procure the crop from them directly, said Mr. Prabhu.

Though DEED used to provide skill development like carpentry, tailoring, driving to the tribals, it was disbanded this year due to the pandemic and the next batch of tribals will be trained only during summer once the situation eases, said Mr. Sreekanth.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tribals-staring-at-lack-of-livelihood-opportunities-in-mysuru-district/article32795366.ece

In a quick meeting with officers at the government guesthouse here on Wednesday, he asked them to adopt any suitable method to make sure the death rate was reduced.

There should be better management of hospitals. Senior officers should see that patients are attended to properly in government and private hospitals. They should also make sure that hospitals do not suffer from scarcity of oxygen, drugs and other essential equipment, the Chief Minister told Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath.

Mr. Yediyurappa asked officers to strictly enforce the rule on wearing masks in public places and maintaining social distancing in large gatherings. “We should be even more careful now, as the Union government is relaxing lockdown norms in phases and more economic activities would be permitted in the coming weeks,” he added.

119,2020/10/07,Health Dept. to give its opinion on schools’ reopening: Sriramulu,"A report keeping in mind children’s safety to be submitted to Minister for Primary and Secondary Education Suresh Kumar in a week’s time

Minister for Health and Family Welfare B. Sriramulu on Wednesday said he will be submitting a report to Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar in about a week’s time on the issue of reopening of schools and colleges in the State. The report contains opinions from various experts, including specialist doctors, eminent healthcare professionals and educationists, on the issue.

Speaking to reporters before holding a meeting here for assessing the pandemic situation in Mysuru district, the Minister said he had a virtual meeting with various healthcare personalities and senior bureaucrats of his department to elicit opinions on whether the schools can be reopened when COVID-19 cases are surging and the precautions that need to be be taken for the children’s safety.

This meeting gains importance since guidelines had to be framed by the department like how it did when the SSLC examination was conducted with all precautionary measures.

Children’s safety top priority

“Children’s safety is my priority. We need to address the concerns of parents as well. It is the time to take everyone into confidence on the issue of reopening schools and colleges. Counselling sessions are also necessary before reopening since the children had been out of the schools for several months. All factors have to be looked into before a decision is taken,” the Minister told reporters.

In this connection, the Health Department’s suggestions based on experts’ opinions are being collated and a report will be presented to Mr. Suresh Kumar soon.

Mysuru a hotspot

Mr. Sriramulu said the Centre has identified 60 districts in 17 States that have reported a spike in COVID-19 infections. In Karnataka, Bengaluru and Mysuru have been identified as “hotspots” and strategies are being advised for containing the cases. Besides cases, the death rate is also high in Mysuru. This has become a cause for concern, he said, adding that contact tracing should become effective for curbing the cases.

Dasara

On the ensuing Dasara, the Minister said the government has already decided for low-key festivities. “In the recent video-conference on COVID-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had told Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to take all precautions for containing the pandemic during the festive season. In this regard, I am here to discuss what precautions are necessary to be taken during Mysuru Dasara and give appropriate directions to the health authorities,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/64psbn/article32793750.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07mys-covid,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/health-dept-to-give-its-opinion-on-schools-reopening-sriramulu/article32793678.ece
120,2020/10/07,CM reduces penalty for not wearing masks,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Wednesday reduced the fines to ₹250 in urban areas and ₹100 in rural areas.

Barely a week after the State government increased fines for not wearing masks properly to ₹1,000 in urban areas and ₹500 in rural areas, it made a U-turn on its decision in the face of public opposition.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Wednesday reduced the fines to ₹250 in urban areas and ₹100 in rural areas.

Prior to the increase, violators were fined ₹200. The government’s decision to increase the amount to ₹1,000 did not go down well with many activists and citizens’ groups, who felt it would engender corruption. On Wednesday, protests were held by citizens in front of the BBMP’s office in Jayanagar against the prohibitive fines.

Later in the day, Mr. Yediyurappa in a statement said the fines had been reduced following widespread objections. He urged people to voluntarily wear masks, maintain a social distance, and help the government in its efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.

This is not the first time that the government has attempted to raise fines. When masks were first made mandatory in Bengaluru this May, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) fixed the penalty at ₹1,000 for the first violation and ₹2,000 for subsequent violations. However, it was revised to ₹200 soon after.

The CM’s order was received around 4 p.m. on Wednesday. “We stopped fining citizens soon after and only issued strict warnings,” said a marshal.

According to sources in the BBMP, hand-held machines used by the marshals will have to be recalibrated as they are automated to issue receipts for ₹1,000.

“The recalibration should be completed on Thursday,” sources said, and added that irrespective of the fine amount, there was now better awareness among people about the importance of wearing masks properly.

Srinivas Alavilli from Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy said the government had to first launch targeted communication campaigns to ensure that all citizens know the importance of wearing masks.

“That apart, more than the quantum of fine, it is the certainty of being fined that makes the difference,” he said and added that a bit of ‘Gandhigiri’ would also work.

“We should go around giving roses to those not wearing masks. This will shame them and they are likely to fall in line,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ydc05/article32793358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07bang-protest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cm-reduces-penalty-for-not-wearing-masks/article32793208.ece

“We have decided to have a memorial for the late leader be built in New Delhi. I will release the funds. I will ensure that officers seek and obtain approvals,” Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said in Belagavi on Wednesday. He said the memorial will come up at the Veerashaiva burial ground in Kailash in New Delhi.

He was speaking to journalists at the Sambra airport on Wednesday, before moving to the home of Mr. Suresh Angadi to meet the bereaved family.

“He did a remarkable job as Railway Minister. I had told him several times that he was doing very good work on the lines of what Jaffer Sharief [former Railway Minister and Congress leader] did to Karnataka,” Mr. Yediyurappa said.

“Mr. Angadi was a healthy man and his confidence about his health may have betrayed him. He was suffering from fever, but he neglected it. Even after reaching Delhi, he did not get himself tested in time. That may have affected his health badly,’’ the Chief Minister said.

122,2020/10/07,‘Why no raids against BJP leaders?’,"Questioning the BJP’s claims of CBI’s impartiality, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah sought to know the reason behind the Central investigating agency’s failure to carry out similar raids against BJP leaders.

Fielding queries from reporters on the raids carried out in the premises belonging to Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief D.K. Shivakumar and his brother D.K. Suresh, Mr. Siddaramaiah sought to know whether all BJP leaders were honest.

He referred to the alleged irregularities in the purchase of medical equipment to fight COVID-19 that he had raised in the Legislative Assembly and questioned why the BJP Government failed to carry out a probe in the regard.

“If their contention that they are not targeting anybody is to be convincing, such raids needed to be carried out against BJP leaders also,” he said.

Earlier in the day, KPCC spokesperson M. Lakshmana sought to know why no such investigation by Central agencies was being carried out against the company owned by Jay Shah, the son of Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Contending that the company run by the Home Minister’s son saw its bank balance multiply several thousand times between 2014 and 2015, Mr. Lakshmana said the absence of any probe in the matter shows the double standards of the BJP.

He accused the governments at the Centre and State of pursuing vendetta politics against Mr. Shivakumar, who he called a successful businessman with interests in real estate, power and educational institutions.

‘Yogi unfit to wear saffron robes’

Mr. Siddaramaiah also criticised Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, saying he was unfit to continue in the post or don saffron robes.

Pointing out that there were a total of 27 cases that had been booked against Mr. Adityanath, Mr. Siddaramaiah said a rowdy sheet is opened against a person having just four to five cases. Mr. Siddaramaiah said the BJP should immediately dismiss him from the post to save the party’s reputation, adding that he was not fit to wear saffron robes.

Mr. Siddaramaiah recalled the support given by the then Congress government in Delhi to the family of Nirbhaya, who was also raped and killed in 2012. He said the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh had forcibly cremated the Hathras rape victim with the assistance of the police. The UP government had also misused the police to assault Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kigf8q/article32787267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGP3SIDDARAMAIAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/why-no-raids-against-bjp-leaders/article32787268.ece

124,2020/10/07,HC seeks data on bed availability,"Noting continuous rise in number of COVID-19 positive cases across the State, the High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the State government to submit district-wise data of availability of beds for COVID-19 patients both in public and private hospitals.

Also the government will have to provide the details of beds with ICU facilities and the number of ventilators earmarked for COVID-19 patients both in public and private hospitals in all districts.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar passed the order while hearing through video conferencing the PIL petitions related to COVID-19 health management.

PPE kit disposal

As a large number of hospitals are handling COVID-19 patients across the state, the Bench asked the government to give details of the manner and facility prescribed for disposal of PPE kits used in these hospitals.

The disposal of PPE kits in Bengaluru alone would be an important task as the city has 380 hospitals designated for COVID-19 treatment apart from a large number of medical practitioners and health care workers in other hospitals and clinics are also using PPE kits as per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) prescribed under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Bench noted.

Inspection

Meanwhile, the Bench termed as impractical the Government’s October 3 advice to the district-level expert monitoring committees to inspect one COVID-19 hospital in their respective district every week.

At this pace, it will take 20 weeks to inspect all the hospitals in a district that has 20 hospitals designated for COVID-19 duties, and in Bengaluru city, even if the committee visits one hospital everyday, it will take more than a year to complete the inspection of all the 380 hospitals designated for COVID-19 treatment, the Bench said while directing the government to reconsider the advise given to the committees on frequency of inspection.

As many urban local bodies were not disbursing monthly salaries to pourakarmikas regularly and they released the wages on government’s intervention after the Court’s direction, the Bench directed the government to ensure regular payment of salaries to pourakarmikas by all the ULBs.

50% of people on roads, in parks not wearing masks

Around 50% of the people moving on the public roads and visiting parks in Bengaluru city are not wearing masks though it is mandatory, the High Court observed on Tuesday.

As the government was already directed to take measures to ensure that people adhere to the norm of wearing masks in public places, the court directed the government on enforcement of measures, including imposing of fines.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fy8d4o/article32787254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGP3BEDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-seeks-data-on-bed-availability/article32787255.ece
125,2020/10/07,"Schools, colleges turn to virtual labs to teach practicals","Many virtual labs conduct experiments that are aligned to the NCERT/CBSE and State board syllabi

In an attempt to break away from the tedium of a digital class format where a teacher talks online while students take notes, several city schools and colleges are conducting practical classes by making use of ‘virtual labs’ and also organising virtual field trips of museums and zoos.

Virtual labs allow students to conduct experiments by testing formulae, clicking on icons and test tubes, etc. While it is a far cry from the actual experience of conducting experiments in laboratories, teachers say it’s the best option available given that the government is not allowing schools to open this month.

Manila Carvalho, principal, Delhi Public School (Bengaluru East), said that science teachers in the school use these labs to help students visualise and understand concepts. “Many of our teachers, besides using these virtual labs which are available online, also come to school and record the experiments they conduct. They then share the videos with students,” she said.

Many virtual labs conduct experiments that are aligned to the NCERT/CBSE and State board syllabi.

Dakshayini Kanna, principal of Harvest International School, said that they have been conducting virtual field trips as well. “We can book virtual tours of museums and zoos. We cannot continuously only conduct online classes. We are trying to do everything to make sure that online learning is attractive for the students,” she said.

Several enterprising teachers in government schools and colleges too are making use of these labs.

Visvesvaraya Technological University has tied up with National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal to implement technology enabled learning through virtual labs for all institutions affiliated to the university. The university said that these labs can be used to provide remote experiential learning of courses in engineering and applied sciences.

The move has received a mixed response from students. Karthik S., who studies in a government PU College, started using these virtual labs after his teacher recommended them. “Our college does not have a lab and I am glad that I found these tools to understand concepts better,” he said.

However, Tanya S., a class twelve student of a CBSE-based school says that the virtual labs do not provide them hands-on experience like the regular practical classes. “We understand that our schools have no option but to conduct virtual practical sessions. But if we do not get any practical exposure this academic year, we want CBSE to cancel our practical examination,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wy7yx9/article32787244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGP3LAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/schools-colleges-turn-to-virtual-labs-to-teach-practicals/article32787247.ece

With 5,012 new cases, Bengaluru Urban reported the highest single day spike so far on Tuesday. With this, the total confirmed cases here touched 2,57,241 of which 55,736 are active cases in the district. Previously, on September 29, this district had reported 4,868 cases, the highest on a single day then.

Munish Moudgil, who heads the State COVID-19 War Room, attributed the increasing cases in Bengaluru Urban to higher testing. The city is conducting an average of about 40,000 tests daily, the highest in the country, he said.

“Mumbai and Chennai have been carrying out about 13,000 tests daily. If Bengaluru did a similar number of tests, our daily cases will be less than 1,500. The idea is not to reduce tests to falsely reduce daily cases,” he said.

Overall, the State reported 9,993 new cases taking the total number of cases to 6,57,705. With 91 new deaths, the toll rose to 9,461. This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths. Bengaluru Urban reported 34 of the total 91 deaths. With this, the toll in this district rose to 3,135.

As many as 92,491 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours including 48,035 rapid antigen tests. With this the total number of tests rose to 54,19,954.

Testing compulsory

Meanwhile, having learnt that certain individuals are refusing to get tested thus hampering the State’s efforts to stop transmission of the virus, the Health Department on Tuesday issued an Order making testing compulsory for all individuals identified by the government.

127,2020/10/07,"Fake voter ID card racket unearthed, man held","The Haveri district administration has unearthed a case of fake voter identity cards in which the proprietor of a ‘Samanya Seva Kendra’ (Common Service Centre) was involved.

Proprietor of the centre Jeevan Narasing Rajput has been arrested. The Haveri police have registered a case under sections 465, 468, and 470 of the IPC.

A team of officials, led by Additional Deputy Commissioner of Haveri S. Yogeshwar and others, conducted a raid on the centre, after the driver of the Additional Deputy Commissioner was issued a fake voter ID card. Subsequently, the authorities seized various documents, a laptop, a computer, a printer, a lamination machine, and a hard disk.

Mr. Yogeshwar said the raid was done after his office received information on issue of fake voter ID card on payment of extra money at the centre and a team was formed for the purpose.

“I sent my car driver Abhishek and police constable Vinayak Malavalli in plain clothes to the centre seeking ID cards. The car driver was issued a fake ID card and immediately we conducted the raid,” he said.

Later, Mr. Yogeshwar told The Hindu over the telephone that so far they had come across three fake voter ID cards and also cards of various government schemes. “The accused has revealed that he had purchased a software from Haryana-based firm using which he was issuing fake ID cards,” he said.

130,2020/10/07,Local bodies liable for waste management rule violations,"LSGD to seek annual reports on implementation of SWM Rules

The Local Self-Government Department (LSGD) has suggested amendments to the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act and the Kerala Municipality Act to fix responsibility on the council of each local body and its chairman for non-compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules (SWM), 2016.

The proposal came up for discussion at a recent meeting convened by Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta to discuss action to be taken on the orders of the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for timely compliance with the SWM Rules.

The tribunal had on September 16 warned that it might consider detention in prison of those violating its orders till compliance. “This course of action may have to be considered even against the highest erring officers, if the default continues,” it had said. The Bench had asked the Chief Secretary to inform the erring officials that they would not be entitled to draw their salaries from a specified date till compliance with the rules.

The meeting observed that the secretaries of local bodies did not have delegation and were required to get the approval of the municipal council or chairman, even though they were entitled to fulfil their responsibilities in accordance with the SWM Rules, 2016. “Any delay or non-performance on the part of the municipal council would eventually reflect as the non-performance of the secretary. In this context, it was informed that amendments are to be made in the Panchayati Raj Act and Rules and the Municipality Act and Rules of the State to fix the responsibilities on the council and chairman for non-implementation of the SWM Rules, 2016,” said the minutes of the meeting.

The LSGD will direct the local bodies to submit annual reports specifying the progress made in the implementation of the SWM Rules, 2016 before it and the State Pollution Control Board. The government will inform the tribunal that it has initiated steps for solid waste management under mission mode through agencies like Suchitwa Mission and Clean Kerala Company. The LSGD will have to ensure that the deadlines for the various solid waste management projects are met without failure.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fwqdzt/article32797678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08KI-WALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/local-bodies-liable-for-waste-management-rule-violations/article32797679.ece
131,2020/10/07,Idukki set to take a green turn,"KSEB to tap power from floating solar panels

The district, which hosts the largest hydroelectric project in the State, is turning towards green energy with the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) set to tap power from floating solar panels to be installed on the Idukki reservoir.

In the first phase of the project set to begin in December, 125 MW will be generated.

This is in line with the Centre’s stress on generation of green and renewable energy from non-conventional sources. The large water spread of the reservoir makes it an ideal green energy hub, in addition to the chance of easy transfer of power by underwater cables to the KSEB power grid.

When the project is realised, the district will become the largest producer of green energy in the State.

An official of REES (Renewable Energy and Energy Saving) under the KSEB said a survey by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) found the reservoir suitable to install floating solar panels.

As per its report, 125 MW will be generated in the first phase and 200 MW more in two years. The panels will be installed at the Anchuruli area of the reservoir (100 MW) and the Cheruthoni area (25 MW) in the first phase.

As per an agreement, the NTPC will implement the solar power project on the reservoir and the KSEB will purchase power from the NTPC. The KSEB will set up a 220-kv substation at Nirmalacity near Kattappana to transfer energy produced from the floating solar panels, the official said.

The largest floating solar panels in the country were installed at the Banasura Sagar reservoir in 2017, covering a water spread of 1.25 acres, with capacity to produce 500 kW.

Floating solar panels have higher efficiency compared to ground installed panels due to the control of panel temperature by waterbodies. The panels are installed on a ferro cement floater to move in accordance with water movements.

The high cost of installing the panels and the mode to transfer power make floating solar panels less preferable as a green energy source. However, fast technological upgrades are taking place to reduce the cost.

The large water surface of the Idukki reservoir, where direct sunlight is available, makes it an ideal site for setting up solar panels.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/idukki-set-to-take-a-green-turn/article32797623.ece
132,2020/10/07,Curbs leave fishers helpless,"Many fish landing centres sealed off, fishing villages in containment zones.

With several fish landing centres across the State sealed off due to COVID-19 and fishing villages repeatedly falling into containment zone, fishers in Kerala are facing yet another crisis.

While most other sectors are limping back to normalcy, marine capture fisheries, mainly mechanised fleets, continue to remain in troubled waters.

“They have reopened Cochin harbour after 10 days and at present all four major harbours of Kollam are not functioning. A string of others, including those in Munambam, Vypeen, Beypore, and Puthiyappa, were closed at different times making it impossible for the industry to stay afloat. It is a seasonal industry and boats from neighbouring States are currently exploiting Kerala’s strict fishing protocols. What we need is a more practical guideline as all fishers, both small scale and large scale, are affected,” says Joseph Xavier Kalappurakkal, general secretary, All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators Association.

Since all boats have been instructed to return to the harbours of origin after fishing, it is also not possible for the trawlers to ferry the catch to any other place and market it. Deep-sea fishing was also hit due to the uncertainty over the sector and according to fishers the season ends by November.

“A lot of curbs, including the restrictions on the number of boats, days, and crew members are already in place. Closing down the fish landing centres time and again will aggravate the situation and cause law and order issues. We have already lost numerous working days and if this pattern continues the sector will not be able to recover,” says Baby, fisher from Azheekkal.

According to officials, strict clampdowns are the only option as the thickly populated fishing villages, crowded harbours, and auction halls pose a major challenge.

A considerable number of contact cases were reported from the coastal belt of Kollam during the last week forcing the authorities to close down the harbours and auction halls.

“Apart from fishers, several police and fisheries officials posted on duty at the harbourers had tested positive. After Unlock 4 that further eased the restrictions, people have become increasingly negligent when it comes to ‘break the chain’ guidelines. At present, minor fish landing centres are open for traditional fishers and the main harbours will be functional as cases recede,” says Fisheries Deputy Director K.Suhair.

The Health Department has point out non-compliance of COVID-19 protocols and practical difficulties in maintaining physical distancing norms as the main reason for local transmission. “Most of the houses are located close to each other and if a single person contracts the virus it will spread in the entire area. Among the persons who tested positive from the coastal regions, most are fishers and fish vendors. We will not be able to handle the situation without enforcing extra restrictions,” says an official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/csp0ll/article32797564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvko--Fishing-boats,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/curbs-leave-fishers-helpless/article32797534.ece

The State’s daily case burden of COVID-19 crossed the 10,000 mark on Wednesday, to register 10,606 cases, which took the cumulative case burden to 2,53,405 cases.

The State registered this highest single day spike when the tests done in the past 24 hours were hiked to 73,816, which is again the highest number of tests to have been done in a single day.

Test positivity rate is steady at 14.3% even when tests have been hiked by over 10,000 than the previous highest test figures, indicating that community transmission is intense so that more tests would yield more cases.

The earlier projections had speculated that the State would record over 10,000 cases daily when the epidemic curve reached the peak. However, going by the current trends, the epidemic peak could be many more weeks away, it is believed.

The State recorded the highest number of hospital discharges in a single day on Wednesday when 6,161 people were reported to have recovered from the disease.

Among the active cases, the number of patients who are critically ill and are being treated in ICUs jumped to 610, with another 179 requiring ventilator support.

The death toll rose to 906, with 22 more deaths. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for 14 of these deaths, Malappuram five and Idukki, Alappuzha and Kollam recording one case each.

In the new cases, 97.9% or 10,387 cases are locally acquired infections, of which 741 cases are yet to be linked to a known source of infection. The new cases also include the infections reported in 98 health-care workers.

Among districts, four districts registered over a 1,000 cases, with Kozhikode registering the highest number of cases at 1,576, Malappuram 1,350, Ernakulam 1,201 and Thiruvananthapuram 1,182 cases.

137,2020/10/07,ED chargesheet in gold smuggling case,"Accused says CM knew of her appointment in Space Park

The Enforcement Directorate has filed a charge sheet against three accused persons, Sarith P.S., Swapna Prabha Suresh and Sandeep Nair, in connection with the smuggling of gold through diplomatic channel in Kerala.

The accused smuggled gold from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) 21 times from November 2019 to June 2020. Swapna earlier worked as secretary to the UAE Consul General and Sarith was a public relations officer with the Consulate.

In her statement to the ED, Swapna is believed to have claimed that she met IAS official, M. Sivasankar, five to six times in the presence of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and that the Chief Minister knew her as secretary to the Consul General.

Mr. Sivasankar allegedly told the agency that he knew Swapna as secretary to the Consul General since early 2017 and that they later became family friends. He said he lent her money on several occasions as she was in financial difficulties.

The gold smuggling racket was unearthed after the Customs officials seized 30 kg of gold at the Trivandrum International Airport on July 5. Subsequently, the National Investigation Agency registered a case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, based on which the ED initiated money laundering probe.

It all started after Sandeep first met K.T. Ramees, who was already into gold smuggling. Sarith suggested that gold could be brought through the cargo meant for the UAE Consulate. Swapna was roped in.

While the Consul General had no knowledge about the illegal activities, she sought a commission of $1,000 per kg claiming that it was for him. A cut of ₹65,000 per consignment was decided for each of the other three. Sarith and Swapna got ₹39.66 lakh each for the entire smuggling, it is alleged.

Swapna worked with the Consulate from October 2016 to September 2019, where she got $975 as salary. She started working in the Space Park project since November last year at a salary of over ₹1 lakh. The Chief Minister knew of her appointment, she allegedly told the agency.

The ED alleges that Swapna received about ₹2 crore in commissions, including payments in foreign currency, from various companies.

The Consul General gave her $35,000 in June 2018, while Khalid, Head of Finance in the Consulate, gave her money equivalent to $50,000. She got another $20,000 from the Consul General in his office during August after the floods that year. She also received $50,000 as tip from the ruler of Sharjah during his visit to India, as alleged.

The ED has also recorded the statement of a chartered accountant, who allegedly managed funds for Swapna.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/zaiogt/article32605237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14trmkm02-sapnaG6G7OT0U53jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ed-charge-sheets-swapna-two-others/article32796376.ece
138,2020/10/07,13 lakh females receive self-defence training in Kerala,"Based on Krav Maga as part of Sadhairyam Munnottu programme

Nearly 13 lakh girls and women have received self-defence training as part of the State government’s Sadhairyam Munnottu programme.

The training, based on Krav Maga, a self-defence and fighting system developed for security forces in Israel, is being provided by the State police.

Focus is on self-defence without the use of arms and incapacitating the enemy. The training will help ward off surprise attacks on women and children. Recognising attacks beforehand, learning how not to get trapped in such situations, and developing mental and physical strength to fight the attackers are some of the goals. Sports training for increasing physical health and tips to overcome attackers without losing strength are some of the lessons imparted, a release here said.

20 hours each

Select women police personnel are the trainers. Each district has four master trainers. Training is provided in schools, colleges, Kudumbashree units, offices, residents’ associations, and so on. Each individual is given 20 hours of training.

In 2019-20, 18,055 people received the training in Thiruvananthapuram district alone. It was conducted in 68 schools and 31 colleges. As many as 162 Kudumbashree units and residents’ associations too have completed training.

Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Thiruvananthapuram, R. Jayakrishnan on Wednesday ordered the six Left Democratic Front (LDF) leaders alleged to be responsible for the pandemonium that hindered the presentation of the Budget in the Legislative Assembly on March 13, 2015, to deposit ₹35,000 each as part of the legal requirement for their bail.

The then legislators alleged to be responsible for the destruction of public property in the House are E.P. Jayarajan, V. Sivankutty, C.K. Sadasivan, K. Kunhammed, all Communist Party of India (Marxist) members, K. Ajith of the CPI and K.T. Jaleel, an LDF independent.

The police case was that they had destroyed microphones, computers, grappled with the watch and ward and toppled the chair of the Speaker to deter the then Finance Minister K.M. Mani from delivering the Budget speech.

The LDF's grouse was about Mani's alleged criminal culpability in a bar bribery case that rocked the Oommen Chandy government in 2015.

The CJM had in September turned down a plea by the government to withdraw the case against the leaders. He had ruled that ""public interest"" and ""unity of the legislature"" were not sufficient grounds to arbitrarily set aside a case that involved the destruction of public property and unruly behaviour.

The CJM reportedly saw no merit in the State's argument that any further prosecution of the accused would tantamount to double jeopardy. The Speaker had punished the legislators by expelling them from the House temporarily. Moreover, the protest was a political act to highlight corruption. The accused had no criminal intent, the government had argued.

The then Legislature Secretary P.D. Sarangadharan had reported a loss of ₹2 lakh to public property. In the event the court finds the accused guilty, it could forfeit the bail amount from the accused to recompense the loss to public property.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6-ldf-leaders-told-to-pay-35000-as-bail-amount/article32796320.ece

141,2020/10/07,"Land scam in the making, alleges Chennithala","Award of public land for venture to develop wayside amenities

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Wednesday said the government had palmed off public land at throwaway rates to private players to develop roadside rest-stops for travellers.

Mr. Chennithala said the government had created a company, Overseas Keralites Investment and Forwarding Limited, as a fig leaf to cover the fraudulent give away of prime land at a low price to business persons.

The government had only a minority stake in the company, a mere 24%. It had named one O. V. Mustapha and Baiju George Parappadu as directors, he said.

Mr. Chennithala said the government had not revealed the criteria for including the businessmen as top stakeholders in the so-called public-private venture. Mr Mustapha was on the board of at least 14 other companies, Mr. Chennithala said.

The government had earmarked 2 to 4 acres of prime land for the company to develop the amenities in Alappuzha, Ernakulam, and Wayanad. The government largesse to the company also included land owned by the Steel Industries, Kerala, in Cherthala, he said.

‘Roundabout way’

Mr. Chennithala said the government had found a roundabout way to gift public land to private developers under the guise of a public-private partnership.

The CPI which holds the Revenue Portfolio had opposed the “land transfer”. A bulk of the land earmarked for transfer to the company to purportedly develop wayside amenities abutted arterial national and State highways and had a high real estate value, he alleged.

The government should release the copy of the MoU it had entered into with the company publicly. It should state whether the Cabinet had cleared the land transfer, he demanded.

Mr. Chennithala said the government had denied public sector Indian Oil Corporation the use of public land to develop rest stops and fuel stations for motorists.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/land-scam-in-the-making-alleges-chennithala/article32795974.ece
142,2020/10/07,Electrocution: probe finds faults with KSEB officials,"Electrical Inspector says power line was lying abandoned for long

Amidst the raging protest over the electrocution of a 48-year-old dairy farmer near Vaikom, a preliminary investigation by the Electrical Inspectorate in Kottayam has pointed to serious lapses on the part of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB).

According to James Kutty Thomas, Electrical Inspector, the power line had been lying abandoned for long though the KSEB officials appeared to have no clue about it. “This was an accident long waiting to happen as the line had been active despite complaints from the public,” he said.

While the protocol stipulated that the KSEB officials should conduct patrols and inspect the power cables on a periodic basis, none of them seemed to have visited the location for long.

A common issue

“The instances of low-lying power cables, damaged power poles and obsolete power lines have been so common across the low-lying region from Vaikom to Kumarakom. At the same time, the employees at the KSEB section offices here are being rotated on a regular basis for no solid reasons,” the official added.

The KSEB officials, meanwhile, clarified that the line had not been disconnected as it was used an interlink to provide electricity in case of a breakdown of the existing lines.

K.V. Raju of Padinjarekkara in Udayanapuram, near Vaikom, was electrocuted the other day when he went to a field nearby his residence to cut grass.

Eyewitness accounts suggested that the the power line had snapped and fallen to the ground about three months ago. The power line that passed through the field had fallen into disuse after the KSEB drew a new cable along a nearby road.

No inspections held

Despite several complaints from the local residents against the delay in clearing the obsolete line, the KSEB officials had not inspected the line.

Rahul Raj, son of the deceased, told media persons that the KSEB officials did not even attend his phone calls to inform them about the electrocution. “While attempting to rescue my father, who was lying on the field, I too suffered a mild shock. The body could be retrieved only after people removed the fuse of the power line,” he said.

Earlier on Tuesday, irate residents had stormed the KSEB section office at Vaikom and damaged a couple of motorcycles parked there.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/electrocution-probe-finds-faults-with-kseb-officials/article32795917.ece
143,2020/10/07,KCBC expresses concern over NEP,"Panel says policy will curtail diversity in education

The Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC) has raised concerns over the new National Education Policy (NEP).

The KCBC Commission for Education told the media here on Wednesday that the government deciding what should be taught in schools would curtail diversity in education, have consequent educational, social and political dimensions and therefore remained a cause for anxiety.

The new policy would deny the students the chance to choose polytechnic or ITI-like training after completion of 10th standard. The proposal that students should be given a chance to study various subjects in higher education presented serious practical difficulties. The moot question was, how many colleges in India, which hardly boast a handful of educational institutions of global standing, would have the capability to self-govern, the body said.

Centralisation

The policy, the KCBC maintained, would lead to a concentration of power at the Centre, with the States that have invested heavily in public instruction reduced to onlookers. The commission expressed reservations about the language policy and a potential commercialisation of good academic institutions. There were also concerns about how objective the process of unification of the curriculum and unified cultural outlook would be in the light of the fact that there was no mention about religious and linguistic minority institutions in the policy. This could communalise education, which should be avoided, the Catholic body said.

Rights and quotas

The KCBC said the rights and reservation granted to various weaker sections under the Constitution should be protected. Creation of various central authorities to govern education, it was feared, would choke and strangulate institutions, it said while welcoming the proposals to have a unified schooling system and to promote the use of technology.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kcbc-expresses-concern-over-nep/article32795900.ece
144,2020/10/07,Police oppose Bhagylakshmi anticipatory bail petition,"Says will encourage vigilantism in society

The State police on Wednesday opposed the anticipatory bail plea of dubbing artiste Bhagyalakshmi and two other women.

The police had indicted them for ‘assaulting’ a 50-year-old YouTuber Vijayan P. Nair. Investigators had termed the attack as an illegal act of personal payback against Mr. Nair for ‘uploading’ a slanderous video about Ms. Bhagyalakshmi on his widely watched blog.

The other accused in the case are women’s rights activist Diya Sana and Sree Lakshmi Arackal. The Thampanoor police had registered a case against the trio based on a complaint filed by Mr. Nair. He alleged that the women had barged into his room and battered him.

They allegedly used obscene language against him and stole his laptop and mobile phone. Mr. Nair accused the women of having recorded the assault on their mobile cameras. They, later, broadcast the footage on social media and television news channels, he said.

Ms. Bhagyalakshmi and her partners had surrendered the devices they appropriated from Mr. Nair at the local police station. The police indicted them for criminal trespass, assault, verbal abuse and theft.

The police told the court that granting anticipatory bail to the women on bail would tantamount to encouraging vigilantism in society. The district court here will give its ruling on Friday.

Polarising issue

The episode had triggered a deeply polarising debate on gender equations in Kerala.

Ms. Bhagyalakshmi's critics viewed her embrace of violent personal vendetta as a righteous form of retribution for the trespass on her dignity as tantamount to radical vigilantism.

Her backers perceived the episode as a demonstrative act of political activism aimed at sending a cautionary message to misogynists and abusive men.

Ms. Bhagyalakshmi had expressed her willingness to go to jail for the offence. She had also received support from Left Democratic Front (LDF) women leaders, particularly Kerala Women's Commission chairperson M.C. Josephine.

The police had arrested Mr. Nair earlier on the charge of defaming women. He was currently in judicial custody.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/police-oppose-bhagylakshmi-anticipatory-bail-petition/article32795832.ece
145,2020/10/07,Kerala gold smuggling case: UAE consulate officials need to be probed says NIA,"‘Wider investigations needed to unearth money trail’

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is planning to probe the involvement of some officials in the UAE consulate in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case.

Also Read ED chargesheet in gold smuggling case

The agency informed the NIA Special Court on Wednesday that such aspects need to be investigated after considering the diplomatic aspects involved between India and UAE.

The active or passive role of some consulate officials in the smuggling of gold under the cover of diplomatic baggage and whether some others had facilitated the illegal activities need to be found out.

More clarity would be obtained in these aspects after obtaining the custody of Faisal Fareed and Rabins Hameed, who were arrested in UAE. The confessional statements of some accused also need to be looked into, the agency said.

The agency, which contended that it was still in the initial stages of the probe into the case, said wider investigations need to be conducted in UAE and India to unearth the money trail in the case.

Larger conspiracy

Opposing the bail application of six accused in the case, P. Vijayakumar, Assistant Solicitor General, said a larger conspiracy was hatched among over 30 people and international connections were involved in the case.

Many of the accused had invested huge money into smuggling for the purchase of gold. Over ₹100 crore was suspected to be involved in deal. Some of the investors didn’t collect the returns but reinvested it, which indicated that profiteering alone was not the motive of investment, he submitted.

Arjun Ampalapatta, Senior Public Prosecutor of the agency, said the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau had alerted the NIA in October last year that the proceeds of the gold smuggling through Karipur airport might be used for terror funding and anti-national activities. It had also cautioned the agency to keep a tab on the smuggling operations through the other international airports of the State, he contended.

Court’s poser

The court asked the agency whether it could gather any evidence to prove the terror funding angle of the case after around 85 days of taking over the investigation.

As the prosecution explained the modus operandi of the smugglers, the court wondered whether the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act could be invoked in all cases of smuggling as it did in the diplomatic baggage case.

The court, which would look into the confessional statement of Sandeep Nair on Monday, may pass its orders on the bail applications on the day or Tuesday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/l26peq/article32500914.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/uae-consulate-officials-need-to-be-probed-nia/article32795830.ece
146,2020/10/07,"Over 14,000 applicants for LIFE second phase","3,800 have land and need funds for building house, remaining seek flats under housing project

The city Corporation's wing handling the Livelihood, Inclusion, Financial Empowerment (LIFE) housing project received more than 14,000 applications following the latest call issued by the State government for fresh applications to be included in the project’s beneficiary list.

According to Corporation officials, 14,280 applications were received when the window for submission closed recently. Out of these, 3,800 applicants own land of their own and need only money for construction of an individual housing unit. The remaining applications are for accommodation in the flat complexes which are part of the project.

In addition, another list has been prepared for housing projects under the Scheduled Caste Development Department and the Fisheries Department, both of which together have 2,265 applicants.

In the second phase of call for applications for the LIFE project, 18,008 applications were received. Once the applications are received, it goes through scrutiny with ground visits and adalats. Following the adalat, the list of 18,008 had come down to 9,000, after eliminating ineligible applicants. Among those who applied were those who claimed that their existing houses were dilapidated, a claim which did not stand scrutiny. Out of the 9,000 applicants shortlisted, 1,304 own land. The initial number of 14,280 in the latest round is also expected to be similarly reduced after scrutiny.

Close to a 1,000 families have also bought land in the city Corporation under the land purchase scheme of the LIFE project. The funds for land purchase are provided from the plan fund of the respective local body, while the LIFE Mission provides funds for the construction of houses. The State government had last year increased the funds for the land purchase scheme. Under the scheme, a family from the general category living in a municipal Corporation area will get ₹5.25 lakh to purchase a maximum of 3 cents of land, compared to the ₹2.5 lakh provided at the beginning of the scheme in 2016.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/over-14000-applicants-for-life-second-phase/article32795419.ece
147,2020/10/07,HC directive to keep Munnar clean,"PCB directed to inspect treatment plants of hotels and resorts

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has directed the Pollution Control Board (PCB) to investigate the functioning of treatment plants maintained by establishments such as hotels and resorts in Munnar and to ensure that the wastes generated in such establishments are not dumped in any public property.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chali on Wednesday directed the PCB to ensure that the treatment plants of these establishments functioned on a day-to-day basis and that they were set up with the consent of the board.

Legacy waste

It also directed the Munnar grama panchayat to take steps to remove the legacy waste at its Kallar trenching ground in six months and complete construction of the septage treatment plant there in six months.

The court directed the Idukki District Collector to ensure that the removal of the legacy waste and the construction of the septage treatment plant were carried out by the panchayat in its trenching yard without the interference of any third person.

The panchayat was also directed to take immediate and appropriate action against waste generators under the provisions of the Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, with police assistance.

Financial benefits

The Bench ordered that financial benefits of any programmes, missions, and the financial benefits from any fund of the Central government or any other scheme be provided to the panchayat.

The directives were issued on a writ petition filed by R. Sudha, a Kochi-based lawyer, seeking a directive to the State government and others to take stringent actions against owners of hotels and resorts for discharging the septic tank and other wastes into the rivers, lakes, and streams in and around Munnar, the Eravikulam National Park, the Periyar Tiger Reserve, and the Chinnar and Idukki Wildlife Sanctuaries.

Govt.’s duty

The court observed that the State government, the panchayat and other bodies constituted for the protection of environment had a duty to ensure that the pristine beauty of the hillock was sustained and maintained.

The Munnar grama panchayat had submitted that it had decided to set apart its trenching ground at Kallar for establishing a septage plant after removing the legacy waste.

148,2020/10/07,Tracking a wind-aided migration across continents,"Citizen project monitors movement of dragonfly Pantala flavescens from Africa and back

Migratory dragonfly Pantala flavescens has started arriving in swarms to the State. They have been spotted at Vellayani Lake here, Kole farms in Thrissur, Kasaragod, and in beaches.

The inter-continental migration of these dragonflies, known as Wandering Gliders, that cross oceans with the help of winds has always fascinated naturalists. Society for Odonate Studies, a group of nature enthusiasts dedicated to the study of dragonflies, has launched an inter-continental citizen science project titled Pan Pantala Track to track their migration.

A study published in 2012 has proved that these dragonflies migrate from Africa to India and back with the help of the monsoon winds. They lay eggs in temporary pools formed after the rains where their larvae grow rapidly, feeding on mosquito larvae and other small creatures. They complete four life cycles to finish their migratory circuit.

Sole claimant

“It is the only regular transoceanic movement of any insect in the world. It is also the longest; the total distance travelled in a year would be more than 16,000 kilometres,” says Subramanian K.A., Scientist-E, Zoological Survey of India, who launched the project online. Although it is presently the most abundant dragonfly species in the world, it needs to be studied how it responds to the changing climate, he adds.

“KoBo Toolbox, a free open-source tool for data collection using mobile phones is used for the project. Observers can upload data from anywhere in the world"", says Sujith V. Gopalan, a coordinator of the study. “We thought of starting the study in India and extending it to other countries. Already enquiries have come from Israel, South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya. We expect the project to be on a global scale soon. It will help us understand more about the grand migration.”

34 sightings

Since Wednesday morning, 34 reports of spotting have reached from Bengaluru, Trichy, Thanjavur, Coimbatore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Ernakulam, Kottayam, and Thiruvananthapuram. “We have reports of more than 1,000 wandering gliders,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cj59ny/article32794881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pantala-flavescens,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tracking-a-wind-aided-migration-across-continents/article32794882.ece

152,2020/10/07,Is liberal arts education the way to go?,"Despite the expectation that learning should have an immediate (and easy to discern) application, worth, or utility, liberal arts education has a lot to offer

As the jury still seems to be out concerning the value of Liberal Arts learning, its advocates and exponents remain on the back-foot. They are forced to translate the complex value systems that define Liberal Arts education into terms that have been preordained by various significant others: such as the ‘hard’ sciences, the ‘national’ curriculum, or ‘employability’ metrics. External appreciations of the Liberal Arts hang, therefore, in the balance.

Freedom first

If accusations of these fields’ incoherence and incompatibility are fair, what might future students in the Liberal Arts make of it all? From their inception, the Liberal Arts fields literally and metaphorically put freedom first. Whether this was initially a strategic or else a descriptive manoeuvre, putting ‘freedom first’ certainly has its benefits.

For it demands a response — whether from its proponents, adherents, sceptics, or detractors — that engages the actual qualities of liberal knowledge. For example by unpacking the expectation that learning should have an immediate (and easy to discern) application, worth, or utility.

The freedom that is given pride of place in Liberal Arts fields is open-ended. Ostensibly, it pertains to the individual’s freedom to choose their own path of study, and thus to become empowered with a view to making sense — crucially in their own terms — of a loose matrix of facts, insights, experiences, languages, values, responsibilities, knowledges, understandings, evaluations, soft skills and competences.

It is here, in the open and active mind of the learner as well as in the invisible college of higher learning, that the ethos of ‘freedom first’ acquires an exciting combination of depth and meaning, especially in its capacity to impart social as well as intellectual responsibilities to the individuals and the institutions that are involved.

Resembling something like academic citizenship, Liberal Arts fields encompass an almost infinite configuration of subjects,to enable diverse kinds of transnational exchange and personal development. But their role in sustaining economic development and human flourishing — whether in respect of our knowledge of fundamental rights and freedoms, or our revaluation of constitutional forms of citizenship — seem to be routinely ignored.

Liberal Arts learning is open to Indian and many other student nationalities. The heritage of transnational intellectual cooperation helps us to address another important dimension of the ‘freedom first’ maxim, which can be sharpened in an effort to highlight the significance of liberal values worldwide.

Considered less as a domain of social and intellectual autonomy, which might be presumed or hoped to exist independently of market forces, of vocational strictures, and of political dogmas, Liberal Arts fields actually intimate how and why human freedom, rights, and responsibilities persist at the heart of liberal democracies.

In this light, efforts to redefine India’s Liberal Education in the Arts Fields (LEAF) — not only as a supplement to the knowledge systems and funding priorities associated with STEM, but also as a way to enhance intellectual, cultural, and institutional autonomy and productivity — are hugely significant. Created by Professor Rukmini Bhaya Nair (IIT Delhi), the LEAF agenda anticipates the long-term resolution of the ‘Grand Challenges for the Humanities in India’ and was submitted in a report to the MHRD, in June 2019. LEAF anticipates a fully-fledged and sustained response, from educators, students, and civil society alike, to these challenges.

But will this help tip the scales, in favour of our love and appreciation of knowledge and freedom? Those in favour should acknowledge and amplify India’s historic and current contribution to the Liberal Arts, as has become evident in institutions like Viswabharati University (West Bengal), Ashoka University (near Delhi), and FLAME (Pune; formerly the Foundation for Liberal and Management Education). Then we can invite the jury to reconvene, to appreciate anew the symbiosis of interests and ideas that enable humanity to liberate, communicate, and innovate. If the LEAF agenda is to inspire “a generation of citizens for our democracy” who are not only able to discern their intellectual, social, and global responsibilities, but also willing to express and engage them, we must now delineate the pathways towards these larger freedoms.

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday condemned the Centre for not including Tamil in the list of languages for admissions to Archaeology degree courses.

“Sanskrit, Bali, Prakritam and Arabic languages have been accepted as qualifying languages but Tamil has been ignored. This is an attempt by the Central government to impose its cultural leanings on Tamil. Everyone should raise their voice against this move that seeks to undermine the multi-cultural identity of the country,” Mr. Stalin said.

He said that for the past 10 years in Tamil Nadu, citizens of the State have been denied jobs in Railways and the Electricity departments, the Cordite factory in Ooty, and these jobs have been given to north Indians.

A look at the composition of the eleven-member steering committee of the AIADMK announced on Wednesday reveals that the party leadership has given representation to different communities, hailing from different geographical regions of the State.

Vellala Gounders (Ministers P. Thangamani and S.P. Velumani) and Mukkolathors/Thevar (Ministers Dindigul C. Sreenivasan and R. Kamaraj) accounted for two each.Of them, the first two are from the western belt, while Mr. Sreenivasan and Mr. Kamaraj are from the southern and the central districts.

Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam is a Vanniyar while J.C.D. Prabhakar, a Christian by faith, can also be counted as a representative of the community, as he is called a Vanniyar Christian. Both are from the northern region.

P.H. Manoj Pandian, also a Christian, is perhaps the youngest of all the members in the steering committee and he fills the slot for the Nadar community too. He and Sholavandan legislator, K. Manickam, who is from the Devendra Kula Vellalar community, hail from the southern belt.

Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, former Minister P. Mohan and former Member of Parliament, R. Gopalakrishnan are representatives of fishermen, Pillai and Yadava communities respectively, the first two of whom are from the north and the last, the south.

The absence of some of well known faces of the party such as School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan, former Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha M. Thambi Durai, Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar and Cooperation Minister Sellur K. Raju in the committee did not go unnoticed.

155,2020/10/07,"With herbal garden and library, Siddha COVID-19 care centre in Tirupathur strives to keep patients engaged","The goal is to keep patients motivated and confident during their stay at the centre, a doctor said

From music, to herbal gardening and a library to provide food for thought, the Siddha COVID-19 Care Centre in Tirupathur has made several arrangements to ensure that patients are fully occupied during their stay at their premises.

The Tirupathur Siddha COVID-19 Care Centre was started at the hostel of a government polytechnic college in Natrampalli two months ago, and has 60 beds in 26 rooms . To date, more than 480 patients have been treated and around 430 have tested negative and been discharged.

“During their time in the centre, we wanted to keep the patients engaged and not think about the infection. We already have a television and 24-hour-music, but we wanted something to keep them occupied and at the same time, educate them,” said V. Vikram Kumar, government Siddha doctor who is the coordinator for the Siddha COVID-19 care centre.

Hence, based on instructions from Tirupathur collector M. P. Sivanarul, a herbal garden was started. “We have 50 varieties of herbal plants including karpooravalli, tulsi, hibiscus, thumbai, thuthuvalai, papaya, adathodai and others. Their uses are stated in a board beside the plants,” he added.

Every morning and evening, patients water the plants and take care of them. “We wanted to improve their confidence levels and motivate them. Books are the best medium to do this. Hence we also started a small library with a few hundred books,” Dr. Vikram Kumar explained.

The library comprises books by Tamil authors, books on Siddha medicine and on the environment. “People learn new things and many have picked up the reading habit now,” he added.

Apart from this, the patients perform yoga and light exercises everyday. “Food is provided in mud pots,” he explained.

One of the patients said that he initially came in fearful.. “But after coming here, I felt very relaxed. It was as if I was at a resort. Food is provided on time. I also learnt about medicinal plants and their uses,” said the patient.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4f5c7c/article32791619.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07OCTTH--Libraryjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/with-herbal-garden-and-library-siddha-covid-19-care-centre-in-tirupathur-strives-to-keep-patients-engaged/article32791620.ece

157,2020/10/07,Guest lecturers to get their dues but no word on filling vacant teacher posts,"The Tamil Nadu Higher Education Department has issued an order releasing funds to pay guest lecturers their dues. The decision would cover 2,423 teachers who were appointed as guest lecturers in the government arts and science and teacher education colleges in the State.

The guest lecturers will be paid ₹15,000 a month due to them since April. According to the Government Order, 1,623 guest lecturers in men’s arts and science colleges; 760 teachers in women’s colleges; 25 lecturers in men’s teacher education colleges; and 13 in women’s teacher education colleges will benefit.

“The lecturers have been working since April without pay. We were told to employ them for evaluation and internal assessments. But how can we extract work from them without giving them payment? The government cited (the COVID-19) lockdown as the reason. We had been repeatedly pointing out that they have lost their livelihood due to the pandemic,” said an office bearer of the Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers Association (TNGCTA).

The GO, issued on Tuesday, cited a letter from the department the College Education director that at the start of the academic year 2019-20 there were 3,443 vacancies. The government had said that it would not be able to fill vacancies at present and permitted the colleges to appoint guest lecturers to continue the teaching-learning processes.

Government college teachers blame the DCE for not conducting the transfer counselling last year. With around 70-80 more teachers retiring the number of vacancies has also increased in arts and science colleges.

TNGCTA members point out that they had been repeatedly appealing to the government to appoint faculty to the posts that fell vacant following retirement of existing faculty. There was some relief when earlier this year the government increasing the retirement age by a year. The number of those who retired fell marginally. However, this number would go up next year, they add.

There is yet no word about filling vacancies in constituent colleges that the government took over. When the government takes over the rest of the 24 constituent colleges more vacancies would arise as new posts would be created, the members say.

Meanwhile, the government has started seven more colleges this academic year but there has been no mention of faculty appointment. When the government creates posts in these colleges another 70-80 vacancies would arise, said T. Veeramani, general secretary of the Association.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/guest-lecturers-to-get-their-dues-but-no-word-on-filling-vacant-teacher-posts/article32789983.ece
158,2020/10/07,Sugarcane growers in TN demand settlement of dues and amendment to bankruptcy law,"In a memorandum addressed to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry State Private Sugarmill Cane Growers’ Associations, has said that a delay in settling dues has left hundreds of farmers in distress

The Federation of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry State Private Sugarmill Cane Growers’ Associations has urged the Union government to take steps to ensure payment of dues totalling ₹65 crore owed by four private sugar mills -- two in Cuddalore district and one each in Thanjavur and Nagapattinam districts -- to farmers.

In a memorandum addressed to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, K.S. Venkatesan, secretary of the association said that the delay in settling dues had left hundreds of farmers in Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Thanjavur districts in distress.

He said that Ambika Sugar Mills at Chittoor and Thiru Arooran Sugar mills at Thirumandakudi and Kottur were yet to settle dues to cane growers who had supplied sugarcane to the mills over the last four years.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has already initiated insolvency proceedings against the four mills based on petitions filed by banks. This has confirmed the fear of farmers that they will no longer get the pending dues, he said.

The Association also demanded that an amendment be made in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to change the status of cane growers from operational creditors to priority creditors.

The Tamil Nadu government has already sent a proposal in favour of the amendment to the Centre.

The Union government has the responsibility to protect the welfare of farmers. Hence, it should immediately intervene and ensure settlement of pending dues to farmers, Mr. Venkatesan added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sugarcane-growers-in-tn-demand-settlement-of-dues-and-amendment-to-bankruptcy-law/article32789686.ece

160,2020/10/07,Edappadi Palaniswami will be AIADMK’s CM candidate: O. Panneerselvam,"A 11-member steering committee has been set up to guide the party on all matters.

Edappadi K. Palaniswami will be the ruling AIADMK’s candidate for the post of Chief Minister for the upcoming 2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly election.

Deputy Chief Minister and party coordinator O. Pannerselvam announced this at the party headquarters on Wednesday morning in the presence of senior leaders and Ministers ending the unease within the party over the issue since August 15.

Prior to Mr. Panneerselvam’s announcement, the Chief Minister, as an indication of agreeing to the former’s principal demand for an eleven-member steering committee, made public the composition of the panel, which would guide the organisation on all matters. The formation of the panel was one of the points of agreement at the time of merger of groups led by Mr Palaniswami and Mr Pannerselvam in August 2017. A resolution adopted by the general council in September 2017 too made a mention of the committee.

Those who made it to the panel were Dindigul C.Sreenivasan, R. Kamaraj, P. Thangamani, S.P. Velumani, D. Jayakumar and C.Ve. Shanmugam, all Ministers; K. Manickam, Sholavandan legislator;P Mohan, former Minister; P.H. Manoj Pandian and R Gopalakrishnan, former Members of Parliament, and J.C.D. Prabhakar, former Villivakkam legislator. The first six were regarded as nominees of the Chief Minister and the last five, those of the Deputy Chief Minister.

Conspicuously no woman leader was nominated to the steering committee. Former Ministers B. Valarmathi and Gokula Indira were said to be aspirants for a slot in the committee.

Mr. Panneerselvam pointed out that the move to make Mr Palaniswami the party’s CM nominee was in tune with the decision taken at a meeting chaired by chairman of the party presidium, E. Madhusudanan and attended by key functionaries. He added that this was approved by senior office-bearers and the steering committee.

The day’s developments brought to a close the debate witnessed by the AIADMK in the last two months over the issue of the CM candidate. After a stormy meeting of the party’s executive on September 28 wherein Mr Panneerselvam and Mr Palaniswami had aired their differences, the former did not attend a meeting held by the latter on the prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic in the State. After the Deputy Chief Minister’s return to Chennai on Monday night from his home district of Theni where he met his supporters over the last weekend, negotiations between camps of the two leaders commenced on Tuesday morning and lasted till early hours of Wednesday.

Asked why the discussion went on for hours, sources in the party said most of the time was spent with regard to finalising names of the members. Shortly, the terms of reference regarding the committee would be worked out as the panel’s functions and powers had not been spelt out in the party constitution.

Mr Palaniswami, who hails from Salem in the western district of the State, became the Chief Minister in February 2017 under dramatic circumstances after Mr Panneerselvam quit as Chief Minister and the Supreme Court confirmed conviction of V.K.Sasikala, former interim general secretary of the party. The fact that his government completed more than three-and-a-half years in office disproved initial forecast made by the Opposition regarding the early end of his regime. In the last three and odd years, his party generally supported the BJP-led Central government though it had taken a different stand on issues such as the three-language formula proposed in the National Education Policy and free power for farmers.

It was for the first time that the AIADMK had made a formal declaration regarding the CM nominee. However, when the party was led by the party founder M. G. Ramachandran and his successor, Jayalalithaa, it went without saying that the two leaders were the organisation's candidates for the CM post.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/64wfu/article32789129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OPS-EPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/eps-is-aiadmks-cm-candidate/article32789107.ece

“The Central and State governments seem to be stepping back from their promises. We want to remind them of their promises through this protest.

169,2020/10/07,Revive Krishi Vigyan Kendra: Ramadass,"Former MP urges Union Ministry of Agriculture to bring institution under ICAR

Former MP M. Ramadass has urged the Union Ministry of Agriculture to convert the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Puducherry, the country’s first, into an institution under the fold of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).

In a memorandum to Narendra Singh Tomar, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Mr. Ramadass said the role of what was a fine institution was being gradually diminished. He sought the intervention of Mr. Tomar, who is also president of Indian Council of Agriculture Society, in salvaging the KVK by bringing it directly under ICAR’s governance.

Mr. Ramadass pointed out that it was the ICAR that established the first Krishi Vigyan Kendra of the country in Puducherry in 1974 and its administrative control was vested with the Agriculture Department of Government of Puducherry since 1992.

The Kendra commenced its agricultural operations in 1974 in an area of 200 acres with 16 permanent staff recruited by ICAR and 250 casual labourers engaged by the Government of Puducherry on a daily wage basis.

The institution was making rapid and remarkable strides over the years to emerge as a first ranking KVK today among 715 kendras in the country. This distinct and unique achievement was made possible by the constant, dedicated and combined work of ICAR scientists and about 200 subordinate casual labourers recruited by the Government of Puducherry as and when required.

However, the solid foundation of KVK began to crack when 153 casual labourers recruited after February 2009 were summarily and arbitrarily dismissed earlier this year. This action was prompted, presumably, at the orders of the Lt. Governor as this engagement, according to her, ran contrary to and in violation of G.O. Ms. No. 22 dated February 27, 2009.

The labourers, who included highly-qualified candidates, were working for ₹200 per day for 20 days in a month for about 11 years without salary for six years with assignments involving both labs and 145 acres of land.

Their work included collaborating with specialists in 21 departments and implementing schemes, programmes and projects, such as All India Coordinated Rice Improvement Project (AICRIP), sponsored by ICAR and National Horticultural Mission, Mr. Ramadass said.

At a time, when the activities of KVK had increased manifold, necessitated growing demand for manpower — various committees constituted by the Government had estimated a requirement ranging from 220 to 270 casual labourers — the dismissal of 153 workers had crippled the institution, the former MP said.

Mr. Ramadass also pointed out that he had drawn the attention of Lt. Governor, Chief Minister and Agriculture Minister of Puducherry to the emerging situation and requested remedial action.

He urged the Ministry’s intervention to save this KVK, and specifically, to persuade the L-G to reinstate the 153 workers, pay them their back wages and arrears of wages for six years and work out a scheme of permanent rehabilitation of these productive workers.

Since the Government of Puducherry is suffering from a serious financial crisis and is closing organisations, the feasibility of taking over Puducherry KVK and converting it into an ICAR-run KVK may be considered, Mr. Ramadass said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/arui8q/article32787031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THKVK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/revive-krishi-vigyan-kendra-ramadass/article32787032.ece
170,2020/10/07,‘Agri admissions in deemed varsities subject to result of cases’,"Petitions were filed challenging the government’s insistence on obtaining NOCs from it

The Madras High Court on Tuesday said that all new admissions made by deemed universities in the State in agriculture and allied courses would be subject to the result of writ petitions filed in the court challenging the Tamil Nadu government’s insistence on obtaining no-objection certificates from it after proving availability of requisite infrastructure.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy passed the interim order on a petition filed by the Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences.

The judges also clubbed petitions filed by the SRM Institute of Science and Technology and the Vellore Institute of Technology, challenging a government order issued on July 28.

Advocate General Vijay Narayan defended the G.O. stating that it had become necessary on the part of the State government to ensure the availability of requisite infrastructure, such as over 100 acres of farmland, and so on, since a greater number of educational institutions in the State had started offering agriculture and allied courses.

When private agriculture colleges affiliated to Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) in Coimbatore were complying with the norms laid down by the State, there was no reason why deemed universities should not, he said. Advocate Abdul Saleem, representing TNAU, said he would adopt the arguments of the A-G.

Stating that agricultural research and education falls under Entry 14 of List II (State list) of the Seventh schedule to the Constitution, the A-G said the State government was fully competent to require deemed universities to obtain NOCs. But Additional Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan, representing the UGC, differed with him.

Senior counsel G. Masilamani and Chitra Sampath, representing the petitioner institutions, said an interesting question of law with regard to the competence of the State government to insist on NOCs from deemed universities had been raised, and hence, they would require time to argue the matter at length.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/agri-admissions-in-deemed-varsities-subject-to-result-of-cases/article32787016.ece

172,2020/10/07,MCI for uniform bond conditions for medicos across the country,"Judges rule that State governments must offer jobs within bond period

The Medical Council of India (MCI) has informed the Madras High Court that it has recommended a uniform procedure to be followed by all States for the execution of bonds by medical students who agree to serve State hospitals for a particular period in return for highly subsidised education in government institutions.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy were informed by V.P. Raman, counsel for MCI (replaced with the National Medical Commission since September 25), that the recommendations were made to the Centre in July, following deliberations with representatives of the governments of 19 States.

The MCI had constituted a committee to come up with a uniform bond policy in accordance with directions issued by the Supreme Court in 2019. While deciding a case involving the Association of Medical Super Specialty Aspirants and Residents and the Centre, the court had stressed the need for uniform bond conditions.

Accordingly, the panel recommended that the bond period for MBBS candidates should not exceed one year, and the bond value should not be over ₹10 lakh for those admitted under the all-India quota (AIQ). The bond value alone could be increased to a maximum of ₹15 lakh for students admitted under the State quota. After a year of bond service, the candidates could be allowed to serve for one more year.

The State governments must induct the candidates into government service within three months of completion of internship, failing which the bonds would stand terminated. Further, those who opt for the Defence Services must be exempted from rendering compulsory bond service. For PG students, the bond tenure should be restricted to a maximum of two years for State quota candidates and one year for AIQ candidates. Their bond values should not exceed ₹20 lakh and ₹15 lakh respectively. In so far as super speciality courses are concerned, the committee recommended a common bond policy of two years and ₹20 lakh.

The submissions were made during the hearing of several writ petitions filed by doctors who pursued PG degree and diploma courses under the AIQ in government medical colleges in Tamil Nadu between 2012-13 and 2015-16. The government neither provided them jobs in government hospitals as per the bond conditions nor returned their original certificates.

Disapproving of the course of action adopted by the government, Chief Justice Sahi, in his 166-page judgment, held that the government ought to have offered the petitioners jobs within the bond period of two years. Failure to do so would render the bonds infructuous, and all their original certificates must be returned forthwith, he ordered.

Though the petitioners contended that the State government was not entitled to demand the execution of bonds by AIQ candidates, the first Division Bench negatived the contention. The judges said that those who had signed the bonds before taking up the course could not be allowed to challenge the validity of the same bonds after completing the course.

“The idea of compelling pass-outs to serve the State hospitals is neither unjust nor against the students. It subserves a benevolent public purpose, namely that the people of the State are able to receive the best of medical attention,” the Bench said, adding that the State was also duty-bound to provide the best facilities to medical students.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/x5vbw6/article32786982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7THHC-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mci-for-uniform-bond-conditions-for-medicos-across-the-country/article32786983.ece

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar announced the findings of the survey during a programme held in line with the National Voluntary Blood Donation Day observed on October 1.

The Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and the Tamil Nadu State Blood Transfusion Council organised a webinar on “Emerging challenges in blood transfusion services” on Tuesday. They were working to raise awareness about regular non-remunerated voluntary blood donation across the State, according to a release.

The Minister released the blood donation information, communication and education posters and launched an online chatbot named “Punch Paati” that would serve as a tool to allay doubts on HIV and blood transfusion services.

He lauded the efforts of the blood bank team and organisers of voluntary donation camps for maintaining sufficient quantity of blood in all hospitals.

During the COVID-19 period, a total of 1,77,400 units of blood were collected across the State and 1,74,500 units were transfused to the patients in need. The monthly average of 34,000 units of blood were maintained in the State during the pandemic, the release said.

176,2020/10/07,Conservation work just in time saves Udayagiri Fort,"Originally a mud fort, it was rebuilt with stones by King Marthanda Varma

A few kilometres from the Padmanabhapuram Palace in Kanniyakumari district stands Udayagiri Fort, which once housed an iron foundry and arms manufacturing unit of the Travancore kings. Years of neglect and growth of a thick forest inside the fort in Puliyurkurichi took a toll on its walls.

Timely intervention by the Department of Archaeology in the form of restoration and conservation saved the fort from further deterioration. “The fund for the work came from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the allocation for Udayagiri Fort is ₹2.3 crore,” said T. Udayachandran, Commissioner of the department.

The fort covers 99 acres of impenetrable forests and a hill and houses many wild animals and birds. The area comes under the control of the Forest Department.

The conservation work includes strengthening of the fort wall and restoration of the memorial of Dutch warrior De Lonnoy, who became the Commander-in-Chief of the Travancore Army, his wife and son and a few other officials.

Originally constructed as a mud fort during Venadu King Sri Vira Ravivarma’s period (1565-1607), it was reconstructed with stone during the reign of King Marthanda Varma (1729-1758), the maker of modern Travancore.

When Marthanda Varma decided to strengthen all the forts of his kingdom, he assigned the task to De Lonnony, who was defeated and captured in a war at Colachel.

The king was fascinated by De Lonnoy’s appearance and asked him to train his bodyguards in modern warfare. He gradually gained the confidence of the king and reached the position of the Commander-in-Chief of the Travancore Army.

“Maharaja, seeing his extraordinary skills and superior knowledge, authorised him to superintend the construction of a strong fort around the hill at Udayagiri,” writes Sankunny Menon in his book, The History of Travancore from Earliest Times. “An iron foundry was established at the Udayagiri Fort where cannons, mortars and balls were cast, and all the batteries were supplied with the necessary pieces of artillery,” he further wrote.

Years of neglect resulted in the weakening of the wall of the fort. “Roots of the trees inside the fort penetrated the walls and dislodged many of them. We have removed the roots and fixed the stones again,” said K. Olimalik, assistant executive engineer of the Archaeology Department.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/z5qeqy/article32786735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06OCTTHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/conservation-work-just-in-time-saves-udayagiri-fort/article32786736.ece
177,2020/10/07,MSP will continue to be there: Finance Minister,"Centre can enact laws on inter-State farm trade, she says

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday reiterated that the minimum support price (MSP) for crops will continue and will not be withdrawn.

“MSP was there and will continue to be there. But because of the focus on increasing the MSP of only paddy and wheat annually, it has brought a distortion in the agriculture sector as many farmers shifted from other crops to the cultivation of paddy and wheat,” she told journalists at Indian Bank’s corporate office here.

Ms. Sitharaman added that only after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took over in 2014, the Central government started shifting the focus of MSP on other crops, such as coarse grains, oil seeds and spices, to reduce dependence on imports.

Attacking the Congress, she said those who gave support price only for paddy and wheat, neglecting other commodities, are the ones who are now raising unreasonable apprehension.

Talking about the three legislation on agriculture reforms, the Minister said that they would benefit farmers, and the bills were introduced keeping their welfare in mind.

She said that prior to the introduction of the farm bills, the issue was extensively discussed with farmers and experts in the agricultural sector.

Earlier, she launched MSME Prerana, an online business mentoring programme for MSMEs, an initiative by Indian Bank.

MSME Prerana is the first-of-its-kind initiative by a bank in the country for the sector. This is for empowering entrepreneurs through skill development and capacity building workshops in the local language.

The programme is in collaboration with Poornatha and Co, a firm that designs entrepreneurial development programmes in vernacular using web-based interactive sessions and case studies.

Later, after a meeting with farmers, Ms. Sitharaman said the Centre had every right to enact legislation regarding inter-State farm trade. “What we have done is at the Central level. That aspect of farming, which deals with inter-State trade, is in the Central list. Parliament has every competence to pass legislation which has a bearing on inter-State trading,” she said.

She was responding to a question on the call by Congress president Sonia Gandhi exhorting various Congress-led State governments to pass laws in their respective State Assemblies negating the Centre’s laws as agriculture is a State-subject.

Slamming Ms. Gandhi, she said, “See how much of respect the Congress has for the Indian Parliamentary system. It is really disappointing that the president of the Congress party, which had been in power for a long time, can seek to undermine the parliamentary process.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/yov3jk/article32786704.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07NIRMALASITHARAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/msp-will-continue-to-be-there-finance-minister/article32786705.ece

Deputy Chief Minister and AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam may agree to withdraw from the race as Mr. Palaniswami has hinted that he is open to the former’s demand for the constitution of an 11-member steering committee for the party.

Party panels

At the same time, other committees could also be constituted for handling various activities, such as election propaganda, seat-sharing negotiations with prospective allies and the preparation of the election manifesto.

The Chief Minister and his deputy, who on Tuesday separately held multiple discussions with senior leaders, including Ministers, are likely to announce the decisions at a joint press conference at the party headquarters in Chennai on Wednesday.

Among the issues that had engaged the leaders in prolonged discussions were the composition of the proposed steering committee, the need for other committees for purposes like seat-sharing negotiations with prospective electoral partners and election propaganda work, and the possibility of changes in the functions and powers of key functionaries.

Also read: AIADMK rift | Panneerselvam firm on steering panel

Sources indicated that as per an agreement worked out between the two camps, the steering committee could have six members from the Chief Minister's side and five from Mr. Panneerselvam's side, on the lines of what was agreed at the time of the merger of the two groups in 2017.

Earlier, Mr. Panneerselvam was visited by several Ministers, including S.P. Velumani, P. Thangamani (both considered close associates of the Chief Minister), D. Jayakumar, C.Ve. Shanmugam and R.B. Udhayakumar. Another round of discussions took place both between and within the camps. Any understanding that may be reached between the two leaders would end the months-long, intra-party debate on the AIADMK’s CM nominee.

At a meeting of the party’s executive committee held on September 28, several senior members demanded that the issue be resolved immediately. They hinted their preference for Mr. Palaniswami. But a few others like former Villivakkam legislator J.C.D. Prabhakar did not approve of the way in which the matter was discussed. Senior party leader Panruti S. Ramachandran explained the rationale behind Mr. Panneerselvam’s position on the steering committee.

Hailing from Imagine Documentaries, the project will be directed and executive produced by two-time Academy Award-winner Barbara Kopple (“Harlan County, USA,” “American Dream,” “Shut Up & Sing”), and executive produced by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, along with Campbell, Crawford, Evangelista and Turlington, who have joined in an unprecedented partnership on the series.

“The Supermodels” travels back to the 1980s, when four women from different corners of the world united in New York. Already forces in their own right, the gravitas they achieved by coming together transcended the industry itself.

Their prestige was so extraordinary that it enabled the four to supersede the brands they showcased, making the names Naomi, Cindy, Linda, and Christy, as prominent as the designers who styled them. Today, the four Supermodels remain on the frontlines of culture through activism, philanthropy, and business prowess. As the fashion industry continues to redefine itself – and women’s roles within it – this is the ultimate story of power and how four women came together to claim it, paving the way for those to follow.

The docuseries, which is produced under Apple’s exclusive, first look agreement with Imagine Documentaries, will also be executive produced by Sara Bernstein, and Justin Wilkes.

“The Supermodels” will join Apple’s expanding offering of documentaries and docuseries, including the soon-to-premiere “Bruce Springsteen’s Letter to You”; “Billie Eilish: The World’s A Little Blurry,” directed by award-winning filmmaker R.J.

186,2020/10/07,CM for stricter measures to prevent attacks on Dalits,"Adopt a humanitarian approach when the weak and meek approach for help, police told

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the police officials to take all precautionary measures to prevent the scope for occurrence of any untoward incidents against Dalits.

The police should focus on the preventive measures and be on alert all the time. The responsibility of preventing attacks on the weaker sections by stronger ones was lying with the police and therefore, the need for scaling up the preventive measures.

The Chief Minister made these remarks while reviewing the functioning of the Home and Forest departments with senior officials on Wednesday. He said it was unfortunate that incidents of atrocities against Dalits were being reported from different parts of the country in spite of the measures initiated. He directed the police officials – from higher officials to lower ones – to become part of the society and perform “friendly policing” giving respect to each and every citizen without discrimination and thereby, enhance spirit of policing. The officials concerned should adopt humanitarian approach when the weak and meek approach them for help and protection.

On the other issues, the Chief Minister said since the formation of Telangana State, one of the major achievements of the government was eradication of manufacture and sale of illicit liquor. However, there were reports suggesting that some illicit liquor manufacturing was taking place in a few places following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. “This has to be stopped forthwith,” he said.

The police and Excise officials who worked for making Telangana illicit liquor-free State should work with the same zeal in coordination. The police should also be on alert about social evils like gambling and deal stringently with those indulging in such activities.

The government had given special attention to women protection and the police should put extra efforts in this direction.

Advising farmers not to bring their produce to the market yards, he said arrangements were being made to ensure purchase of the crop at the farmers' doorstep on the lines of the purchases made amidst Coronavirus pandemic last season.

The government had on Tuesday announced support price of ₹1,888 a quintal for A-grade variety and ₹1,868 for B-grade variety provided they had less than 17 per cent moisture content. The Chief Minister said harvesting was expected to continue for a month and a half and officials of the Agriculture, Marketing and Civil Supplies departments should take steps to avoid inconvenience to farmers during purchase of the crop.

Officials had been directed to prepare accurate estimates of the quantum of produce based on which an action plan for procurement should be prepared. With the government investing in enhancing water availability and providing investment assistance, barren lands were being brought under cultivation and there was reverse migration to villages.

The officials concerned should accordingly make fool proof arrangements for immediate payment of the amounts to farmers. Given the transformation of the State into a leading agricultural producer, steps should be initiated to strengthen the Civil Supplies department accordingly and an action plan in this direction should be prepared soon.

Since farmers opted for regulated cropping and took up cultivation of red gram in 10.78 lakh acres, steps should be taken to purchase the commodity too.

188,2020/10/07,Congress MLA questions govt’s silence over rape attempt on minor in Khammam,"Congress team visits the girl at the hospital

Congress MLA D. Seethakka, on Wednesday, questioned the silence of the government over the rape and murder-attempt on a 13-year old from Khammam, who is now battling for her life in Osmania General Hospital.

Ms. Seethakka along with TPCC spokesperson Indira Shobhan and a team of Congress workers visited the girl in the hospital, said it was unfortunate that neither a Minister nor an MLA visited the family even after 18 days of the incident.

She said the government did not even shift the girl with 70% burns to a private hospital for better treatment. “This government is blind and deaf to the rape of a Dalit girl and it is shameful that none from the government has responded so far,” she remarked.

The girl was allegedly set ablaze after she resisted rape by the son of the house owner where she is a domestic help in Khammam.

According to police, on September 18, the girl was at the employer’s home when his son tried to rape her. As she resisted and tried to escape. the accused allegedly poured kerosene on her and set her ablaze. The accused family allegedly misled the girl’s parents saying she suffered burns after catching fire while lighting a lamp and also promised compensation.

She was shifted to a private hospital in Khammam for treatment and the police were informed later by the girl’s parents. The girl was shifted to Osmania General Hospital in Hyderabad for better treatment. The accused, a married man, was also arrested. His pregnant wife was not present at home when the incident occurred.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-mla-questions-govts-silence-over-rape-attempt-on-minor-in-khammam/article32791666.ece
189,2020/10/07,Man accused of setting afire minor girl arrested,"Allam Maraiah, the town-based 25-year-old married youth accused of setting a 13-year-old minor Dalit girl on fire for resisting his rape attempt over a fortnight ago, was arrested by the One Town police here on Tuesday.

The girl, who worked as a domestic help in Maraiah’s house at Mustafanagar here, suffered grievous burn injuries in the horrific incident. She was shifted to Osmania General Hospital in Hyderabad on Monday night.

The shocking incident came to light more than a fortnight after the horrific crime after a vain bid by the accused, who hails from the same community to which the minor girl belongs, to hush up the matter by resorting to intimidating tactics.

Maraiah was booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act and the relevant sections of the IPC. He was arrested on Tuesday and produced in a local court, which remanded him in 14 days’ judicial custody, police said.

Meanwhile, protests against the horrific incident continued across the district on Tuesday with members of mass organisations taking to streets demanding deterrent action against the accused.

The protesters also sought action against the management of the private hospital in the town, where the grievously injured minor girl had undergone treatment for more than 15 days, for allegedly keeping the authorities in the dark about the shocking incident.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/man-accused-of-setting-afire-minor-girl-arrested/article32787000.ece
190,2020/10/07,GJM demands formation of Gorkhaland State,"At meeting in Delhi, representatives of the Bimal Guru faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha also demand Scheduled Tribe status to 11 Gurkha sub-communities.

Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy on Wednesday met representatives of the Bimal Guru faction of the Gurkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) at North Block. The group demanded the creation of a State of Gorkhaland comprising Darjeeling and the adjoining hill districts in West Bengal.

The Home Ministry had convened the meeting to discuss “issues related to the [GTA] Gorkhaland Territorial Administration”. The GTA is a regional autonomous body formed as a result of tripartite agreement between the State, the Centre and the GJM in 2011.

Another faction of the GJM is led by Benoy Tamang. Currently, it wields control of the GTA and has the backing of the ruling Trinamool Congress. Mr. Gurung is wanted by the West Bengal police under anti-terror law UAPA (Unlawful Activities [Prevention] Act) following the 100-day unrest in the region in 2017.

No State representation

No representative of the West Bengal government attended the Wednesday meeting.

GJM working president Lopsang Lama, who attended the meeting, said they did not discuss the GTA, but submitted a memorandum demanding the creation of ‘Gorkhaland’.

“We did not discuss anything about the GTA. It has failed and we informed the Home Ministry about it. We want a permanent solution and demand the creation of ‘Gorkhaland’ as promised by the BJP in its election manifesto,” Mr. Lama, former vice-president of the GTA, said after the meeting.

Another GJM leader, Kalyan Dewan, said the Union Minister gave them a patient hearing and assured them that the dialogue on their demands would continue.

Later, in a statement, Mr. Lama said the seven-member delegation raised the ‘Gorkhaland’ demand and grant of Scheduled Tribe status to 11 Gorkha sub-communities.

Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and other senior officials attended the meeting.

The statement said, “When the GTA issue was raised, the GJM delegation submitted that the delegation was there to discuss the statehood demand and grant of Scheduled Tribe status and not the GTA since the Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Union of India, the government of West Bengal and the GJM in 2011 was not honoured by the State of West Bengal”.

‘Obstacles by State govt’

The memorandum submitted by the GJM delegation mentioned about the alleged “irregularities, interferences and obstacles committed by the State government, thereby rendering the GTA defunct”.

The GJM said that moreover, all the elected members of the GTA had resigned en masse in 2017, rejecting the said body.

The delegation further submitted on the issue of Gorkhaland being the oldest statehood demand in the country and presented various materials supporting it, the statement said.

“The hon’ble minister, after giving a patient audience, assured the delegation that the government would consider all the materials presented before it and announce the next meeting after speaking with the Hon’ble Union Home Minister Amit Shah and briefing him about the contents of today’s meeting”, it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bnhxro/article32797862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BimalGurung,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gjm-demands-formation-of-gurkhaland-state/article32795881.ece
191,2020/10/07,Bombay High Court suggests Maharashtra government to increase frequency of local trains,"A division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni said currently the Maharashtra government has permitted several sectors to resume and hence it is high time the frequency of trains was increased.

Noting that railway services need to correspond with the partial lifting of lockdown, the Bombay High Court on Wednesday suggested an increase in the frequency of local trains being run in Mumbai to check overcrowding.

A division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni said currently the Maharashtra government has permitted several sectors to resume and hence it is high time the frequency of trains was increased.

“We are now in partial lockdown. Malls are open, hotels are allowed to remain open, government offices are working with 100% staff and several other sectors are now working. Railway services need to correspond with this,” the court said.

“The frequency of local trains on all three lines (western, central and harbour lines) has to be increased to reduce overcrowding, the Bench said.

The court directed the State government to consider its suggestions and see if it can forward a proposal to the Railways for an increase in the frequency of trains. The Bench was hearing a bunch of petitions, seeking a direction to the Maharashtra government to include lawyers and their clerical staff under essential services and permit them to use the local trains to attend court and their office.

Last month, the high court directed the State government to permit lawyers, who had to attend physical hearings in courts, to use the trains.

The court on Wednesday said the number of trains should be increased to 600 on the central and harbour lines and up to 700 on the western line.

“We cannot direct the Railways or the State government to increase the frequency. But, we hope and trust that the State government responds favourably to our suggestions,” the court said in its order.

“Our suggestion is not just for lawyers and their staff, but for the general public too, it said.

The Central Railway runs its services from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in south Mumbai) to Kasara (in Thane) and Khopoli (in Raigad) on the main line, and from CSMT to Panvel (Navi Mumbai) and Goregaon on the harbour line.

The Western Railway runs its suburban services from Churchgate in south Mumbai to Dahanu in Palghar district. The High Court also directed the bar associations of each court in Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar district to inform the number of lawyers who would be willing to attend physical hearings of courts and intend to travel by local trains.

192,2020/10/07,Fuel station blast leaves 9 injured in Bhubaneswar,"Fire occurred when CNG was filled into the tank of a vehicle around noon.

An explosion in an underground Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) tank of a fuel station close to the Governor’s House here left nine persons injured on Wednesday.

Fire occurred when CNG was filled into the tank of a vehicle around noon. “The CNG chamber accidentally caught fire leading to the explosion. Fortunately, the diesel and petrol tanks did not catch fire,” said Sudhansu Sarangi, Commissioner of Police for Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.

Fire tenders were immediately pressed into service and the situation was brought under control, he said.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik announced free medical treatment to those injured and wished their speedy recovery.

An eyewitness said people were queuing up to fill up fuel when the explosion took place. They ran helter-skelter leaving their vehicles. Around 20 to 25 people, who were present at the time of the mishap, received burn injuries. The roof of the fuel station was damaged. Some passersby also sustained injuries.

193,2020/10/07,2 Mizoram political parties merge,"The move follows a phase that has seen the birth of several regional parties in adjoining Assam

Two political parties in Mizoram have merged amid a rush to launch new regional parties in the adjoining poll-bound Assam.

On October 7, the Mizoram People’s Conference (MPC) and the People’s Representation for Identity and Status of Mizoram (PRISM) merged to form People’s Conference Party.

The merger was declared by MPC president and former Indian Revenue Service officer Lalhmangaiha Sailo and his PRISM counterpart Vanlalruata. The two were chosen president and senior vice-president of the new party that seeks to be an alternative to both the ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) and the Opposition Congress.

“The new party will try to fulfil the aspirations of the people who have been deprived of development,” Mr. Sailo told journalists in State capital Aizawl. He panned the Socio-Economic Development Policy, the flagship programme of the MNF and the similar New Land Use Policy of the Congress earlier for doing more harm than good to the people.

One of the oldest regional parties in the Northeast, the MPC was formed in April 1975 by Brigadier Thenphunga Sailo, who became Mizoram’s second Chief Minister.

The MPC allied with another regional party, named Zoram Nationalist Party, to contest the 2018 Assembly polls under the banner of the Zoram People’s Movement. The former walked out of the alliance a year later.

The PRISM used to be an anti-corruption watchdog before graduating to a political party ahead of the 2018 State polls.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2-mizoram-political-parties-merge/article32792996.ece
194,2020/10/07,"Journalist and three others, arrested on their way to Hathras, booked for sedition in U.P.","Yogi Adityanath vows action against “conspirators” over Hathras.

The Uttar Pradesh police on Wednesday booked journalist Siddique Kappan from Kerala and three others, who were arrested on Monday on their way to Hathras, for sedition and other charges.

The four were produced before a local court, which sent them in judicial remand. “Further action will be taken after collection of evidence in the investigation,” said Mathura SSP Gaurav Grover.

An FIR lodged against them at the Mant police station charges them under Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code, Sections 14 and 17 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967; Sections 65, 72 and 76 of the Information Technology Act, for promoting enmity between groups and outraging religious feelings. Section 17 of the UAPA deals with raising funds for terrorist acts.

The four were taken into custody at a toll plaza in Mathura when they were travelling in a car from Delhi to Hathras, the police said. The car was stopped after the police found their activities “suspicious”.

Besides Mr. Kappan, a journalist working with Malayalam portals based in Delhi, the other three were identified as Ateeq-ur-Rehman of Muzaffarnagar, Masood Ahmed of Bahraich and Alam of Rampur. While Mr. Ahmed and Rehman are research scholars, Mr. Alam was the driver of the car, said Ansar Indori, their lawyer.

In the FIR, sub-inspector Prabal Singh accuses the four of carrying pamphlets reading ‘Justice for Hathras Victim’ and moving towards the district to disrupt peace as part of a “big conspiracy”.

Website creation

The FIR alleged that they, along with unidentified others, were linked to a crime involving the creation of an Internet platform carrd.co and website named ‘justiceforhathras’ with the motive of gathering foreign funds to trigger caste riots.

The pamphlets recovered from the four, reading: ‘Am I not India’s Daughter, Made With Carrd’, could spread social discord and mass rebellion, the police said.

Police recovered six mobile phones and a laptop from the four.

The FIR stated that as per media reports, some “anti-social elements” were trying to trigger riots and spread caste tension and adversely impact communal harmony over the Hathras incident.

It said some people were gathering funds for spreading caste fear and triggering riots by planning events and protests.

The organisers of carrd.co were collecting foreign donations to trigger riots, the police said, adding that no legal procedure was followed in collecting these funds thus making their worthy of being seized.

“Such websites are evoking anti-national feelings among the youth”, the FIR stated and accused the platform of engaging in anti-constitutional activities.

The FIR said organisations and workers linked to the said website were using it to “spread rumours about the alleged gang rape incident” to raise funds and provoke caste violence and riots under the garb of providing justice. “Who created the website and with what goal, how much funds were so far collected and where have they been used would all be investigated”, police said.

4 linked to PFI: police

The police, after arresting the four persons, had claimed they were linked to the Popular Front of India (PFI), an outfit blamed by the State government for the violence during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last December.

The PFI said the attempt to link it to a conspiracy to incite caste or communal violence “is completely baseless and ridiculous”.

In a fresh statement, it said, “The new rounds of allegation against Popular Front are nothing but an attempt by the Uttar Pradesh government to divert the attention away from its failure to handle the Hathras rape case”.

CM’s warning

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who had said that those who don't like development wanted to trigger caste and communal riots, asked people to “recognise those faces doing politics on the body of a poor [Dalit girl]”.

“We won't let any conspiracy succeed and all the conspirators will be unmasked. We will take strong action against such elements who want to spread caste discord and anarchy, and disrupt development”, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lvqdfq/article32797750.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KAPPANjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/malayalam-journalist-3-others-arrested-near-hathras-booked-under-sedition-law/article32791003.ece
195,2020/10/07,70 detained in Haryana over protests against farm laws,"They had demanded the resignation of Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala

Police on Wednesday detained around 70 people, most of them farmers in Haryana’s Sirsa, who were squatting on a road leading to Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala’s residence, demanding his resignation from the post against the Centre’s agriculture sector laws.

“We have detained around 70 people who were squatting on a road since Tuesday night, close to Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala’s residence, causing inconvenience to the public. Most farmers had left after yesterday’s protest, but a few people squatted on the road in the city. We are investigating if any ‘anti-social’ elements are among the group,” Bhupender Singh, Superintendent of Police, Sirsa, told The Hindu.

National president of Swaraj India Yogendra Yadav said that the Haryana government was rattled by the farmers’ agitation and was using force against them. “I have been detained by the Haryana police for joining the peaceful dharna at Sirsa. Dharna site has been demolished. About 100 farmers and leaders were arrested. Clearly, Haryana government is rattled by the farmers’ questions, bent upon using brutal force to prevent dissent,” he said.

“More farmers who had joined the Sirsa protest after our detention have also been detained by the police. The farmers’ fight will only get bigger from here,” he added.

Several farmer outfits under the banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee held a protest rally in Sirsa’s Dusshera ground on October 6. Police had resorted to the use of tear gas and water canons to disperse the agitating farmers as they marched to “gherao’’ the residence of the Deputy Chief Minister.

Protesting farmers have termed the new farm laws “anti-farmer’’, and are demanding the Deputy Chief Minister withdraw from the coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party in the State government by resigning from his post. Mr. Chautala of the Jannayak Janta Party has defended the new farm laws as “pro-farmers”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/70-detained-in-haryana-over-protests-against-farm-laws/article32790452.ece

197,2020/10/07,U.P. power dept. staff call off agitation,"No oppressive action would be taken against the engineers and staff of the electricity department for taking part in the agitation, said the note of agreement reached by the two sides.

Engineers and employees of the Uttar Pradesh power department on Tuesday called off their agitation after the state government agreed to put on hold its plan for dissolution and privatisation of the power distribution company Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited.

Under the UP Vidyut Karmachari Sanyukt Sangarsh Samiti, the employees of the power department had launched an agitation and boycotted work leaving many parts of eastern U.P. without electricity on Monday and Tuesday.

After a meeting with the Power Minister Shrikant Sharma and Finance Minister Suresh Khanna, the UPVKSSS representatives agreed to call off the boycott of work.

""No privatisation would taken at any level in UP without taking into confidence the employees and engineers,"" the government said.

Also, no oppressive action would be taken against the engineers and staff of the electricity department for taking part in the agitation, said the note of agreement reached by the two sides.

198,2020/10/07,Haryana’s Sonipat district launches helpline for girls at risk of school dropout,"In a patriarchial society, phones are being kept out of reach of girls for fear of misuse

Panic-stricken Gauri, a student of Class IX who doesn’t use a surname, recorded a quick audio message to alert a community worker that her father had forbidden her from using a mobile phone to access pre-recorded school lectures. Two months since the incident, in her district of Sonipat in Haryana, the local administration on Tuesday launched a toll-free helpline in collaboration with NGOs Breakthrough and Samarthya to reach out to students like her who are at risk of dropping out.

Also read: Online learning: The medium of tomorrow

Fourteen-year-old Gauri’s classmates remember her as a hard-working student, who attended school despite sickness or heavy rain. She is also known to take keen interest in both dancing as well as martial arts. Today, her friends in Rewli village are unaware of her whereabouts.

Her father, 46-year-old Radhey Shyam, says she has been sent to her elder sister’s marital home to help her with household chores. “Phones can be easily misused. Children will use them to talk rather than study. It is an issue when your children are growing up, more so when they are girls because it becomes a question of their honour,” the family patriarch explains in a telephonic conversation.

The COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a nationwide lockdown, forced schools to shut down. When restrictions began to be eased, classes moved online. With the Union Ministry of Human Resources and Development issuing guidelines for schools to re-open from October 15, Haryana plans to ask students from Class 9 to 12 to return to schools while others will continue to take video lessons, explains District Education Officer, Joginder Hooda, who launched the helpline.

The toll-free helpline (1800180135) aims to provide counselling to children with mental health problems due to COVID-19, lend an ear to those unable to cope with academic challenges, counsel parents threatening to deny access to school education due to gender bias and extend career guidance. It will also help parents who are migrants from States like UP and Bihar apply for admissions for their children after their families were displaced during the lockdown.

Five resource persons will operate the helpline, who will then put callers in touch with a counsellor from a pool of 60 psychologists, psychiatrists, NCERT- and CBSE-certified career and academic counsellors. Various school principals in the district will be responsible for disseminating information about the new helpline among students through WhatsApp groups.

“Dropping out of school or school closures for a long period of time have the potential of exacerbating cases of early marriage. Since families treat school expenditure on girls as a liability, when schools are shut, parents think marriage is the best possible solution. Statistics show that if girls are in school, the chances of marriage become much less and the longer they are in education, the longer they are able to delay marriage. If they can stay longer in education, their aspiration for themselves change, they are more self-aware and able to exercise their agency,” explains Sohini Bhattacharya, CEO, Breakthrough India.

Past experiences of natural disasters and humanitarian crises have shown how disruption in schools results in an increase in child marriage. During the 2004 tsunami, girls in Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka were forced into marriage with tsunami widowers. School closures during 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak and 2015 earthquake in Nepal, too, resulted in a spurt in child marriages. Up to 2.5 million additional girls are expected to marry over the next five years as a result of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is in addition to the 58.4 million child marriages that take place every five years.

Online classes have proved to be very challenging for most students in Rewli village where power cuts are common, internet data unaffordable for families with limited means and access to phones is limited, especially in families where there are three to four school-going siblings but only one phone available. Add to this, the challenges that are unique to girls.

15-year-old Priyanka Sahni is able to spend only one hour studying at home during her “school hours” of 8am to 2pm. “Because I am now at home, my mother asks me to help her with domestic chores.” A demand never made of her brothers. Her household responsibilities have more than doubled as she has to sweep and swab the house clean, wash utensils, in addition to helping her mother in the kitchen, which she also used to do before the lockdown.

Her classmate, Kajal Kanaujia, complains that she even has to do the heavy lifting at home such as fetch water, even though her brother is the one with perks like owning a phone.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/23gdr1/article32788769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDSONEPAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/haryanas-sonipat-district-launches-helpline-for-girls-at-risk-of-school-dropout/article32788770.ece

The WODC was set up with the objective of removing regional imbalances by undertaking accelerated development programmes in western Odisha – the region infamous for incidences of poverty and distress migration. The jurisdiction of WODC spreads over 89 blocks of 10 districts.

According to CAG report for general and social sector for the year ended March 2018, which was laid in the State Assembly on Tuesday, irrigation as a priority sector was not provided with adequate funds between 2015 and 2018.

“Contrary to the decision of WODC in August 2013 to give highest priority to irrigation sector, it had not been given priority. Other projects which were not critical to the development of the region, were given highest priority and funds to the tune of ₹159.41 crore (39 %) were allocated,” the apex audit agency says in its report.

“Construction of 77 community centres in Rourkela Municipal Corporation (RMC) were approved at ₹3.03 crore during 2015-18 though the city was being developed as a ‘Smart City’ and did not need allocation from WODC,” it points out.

Further, ₹32 lakh was allotted (2014-15) for installation of seven statues in RMC area, which were not critical activities and violated the instructions of the government, issued in November 2013.

“The amount could have been utilised in the critical projects, which could not be completed due to paucity of funds,” the CAG says.

When auditors sought response of the State government on misplaced priority, The Planning and Coordination Department stated that those projects had been sanctioned in view of public demand. The fact, however, was that the sectoral allocation norm approved by WODC was not followed in allocation of funds, the CAG points out.

Out of 89 blocks coming under WODC, 34 blocks (38%) were very backward and 25 blocks (28%) were backward. In June 2013, the State government had instructed to give more priority to very backward and backward blocks.

“Out of total outlay of ₹409.72 crore, during the years 2015-18, ₹183.41 crore (45%) had been allotted for developing and developed blocks, while only ₹128.79 crore (31%) had been allotted for very backward and ₹97.52 crore (24%) for backward blocks,” finds the apex audit agency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cag-finds-misutilisation-of-funds-allocated-for-western-odisha/article32788451.ece
201,2020/10/07,Rhino horn piece puts Nagaland politicians in discomfort,"Ex-lawmakers’ association worried after contractor in arrested Assam reveals he sold one to a former MLA

A piece of rhino horn has triggered anxiety among the members of an association of former lawmakers in Nagaland.

The Ex-Parliamentarians’ Association of Nagaland (EPAN) has been “disturbed” ever since an arrested contractor from Assam’s Karbi Anglong district disclosed that he had sold a piece of a rhino horn to a former Nagaland legislator. The horn had been sawn off a rhino shot in the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve months ago.

“Manshing Terang, the contractor from Diphu (headquarters of Karbi Anglong district), confessed to us that he sold a broken piece of the rhino horn to a former Nagaland MLA in August,” Piraisoodan B., Kaziranga’s assistant conservator of forest told journalists on October 2. He said the contractor, well-known for his socio-cultural activities, claimed to have also met the wife of the former MLA.

On October 5, the EPAN sought the disclosure of the rhino horn piece buyer’s name as the “suspense” over not naming the person concerned has “tarnished the image” of Nagaland’s former legislators.

“Our association stands for the preservation of flora and fauna,” EPAN president Joshua Sumi said, requesting Assam’s forest authorities to disclose the name of the MLA who allegedly bought the piece.

P. Sivakumar, Kaziranga’s director said the name of the buyer would be revealed after all material evidences are collected. “We know who he is,” he added.

The police and forest guards have caught almost a dozen people accused of poaching rhinos in Kaziranga and other wildlife reserves in Assam. Essentially compressed hair and rhino horns are sold in China and Southeast Asian countries in the belief that they act as an aphrodisiac.

The Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985, has an estimated 2,413 rhinos. The park houses 55% of the world’s total population of one-horned rhinos.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5vh49z/article32787272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RHINOKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rhino-horn-piece-puts-nagaland-politicians-in-discomfort/article32787273.ece
202,2020/10/07,Landlord booked for rape of tribal labourer in Gujarat,"A 22-year-old tribal woman working as a farm labourer in Gujarat’s Kutch district was allegedly repeatedly raped by the owner of the farm. The police have booked the owner based on a complaint lodged by the victim.

The alleged incident had occurred on September 16 in Ratnal village of Kutch district but the FIR was registered only on Tuesday as the accused Ranchhod Ahir had threatened to kill husband of the woman if she disclosed the incident.

The tribal couple are migrant workers from Dahod in Gujarat.

According to the police, they were working as labourers at Ahir‘s farm when the incident occurred. After the incident, the traumatised couple returned to Dahod without approaching the police.

However, with the help of an NGO, Majdur Adhikar Manch, which works for the cause of migrant workers, a zero FIR was registered at Sabarmati police station in Ahmedabad after pressure from different sections including the human rights cell of the Gujarat police.

According to Mina Jadav of the NGO, officials at Sabarmati police station initially refused to register the FIR but after the intervention of the human rights cell, a complaint was lodged and subsequently transferred to Kutch.

A zero FIR can be filed at any police station and can be transferred to the appropriate police station under whose jurisdiction a crime has taken place.

The accused has been booked under sections 376 (2) (n) (committing rape repeatedly), 354 (A)(1)(i) (sexual harassment), 506 (2) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

203,2020/10/07,Assam court’s order on cattle found to have “crept into blatant illegality”,"Release of animals to the owner “cannot be considered” during pendency of trial, says Gauhati High Court

The Gauhati High Court has said an order pertaining to seized cattle by the court of a sub-divisional judicial magistrate in north-eastern Assam’s Biswanath district had “crept into blatant illegality”.

Disposing of a petition by Dhyan Foundation, an NGO tasked with rescuing cows from cattle smugglers in Assam since November 2019, the GHC found that the local court’s order allowing possession of 26 of 116 seized cattle to one Md. Babul Hussain “de hors the provision” of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.

(De hors means “out of agreement” or “foreign to” something in discussion.)

“Such an order of the learned court... crept into blatant illegality,” High Court Judge Rumi Kumari Phukan observed, adding that the release of the animals to the owner “cannot be considered” during the pendency of the trial.

The High Court also observed that the Biswanath court had in a July 20 order granted interim custody of the seized cattle to the NGO but had allowed custody of 26 cows to Mr. Hussain through an order on September 4 with the “condition for making payment to the petitioner-foundation towards the cost of maintenance of the cows”.

The High Court in its order on September 23 said the (Biswanath) court “cannot pass such subsequent orders, which amounts to review of its own order(s), that too without giving any opportunity to the earlier zimmadar [NGO]) of being heard”.

The personnel of the Gingia police station in Biswanath district had on July 15 seized 118 cattle that were being transported from Gohpur to Biswanath Chariali town in four tarpaulin-covered trucks. A case was registered after the police booked the drivers and helpers for illegal trafficking of animals.

A local court granted interim custody of 116 cattle — two cows had died during the official process — to Dhyan Foundation on the basis of a formal letter issued by the Deputy Commissioner concerned. The cattle were kept in its gaushala (cow shelter) at Halem in the district.

A spokesperson of the NGO said it has rehabilitated more than 3,500 cattle rescued by the Border Security Force from smugglers along the India-Bangladesh border. Apart from the one at Halem, it runs cow shelters in Goalpara and Dhubri, both in western Assam.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/t403t5/article32787576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CATTLEKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-courts-order-on-cattle-found-to-have-crept-into-blatant-illegality/article32787504.ece

An official said militants made an unsuccessful bid to kill BJP leader Ghulam Qadir at his residence in Ganderbal in the district's Nunar area. “The attack was repulsed and the BJP worker escaped unhurt. However, the PSO, constable Altaf Hussain, was injured and died on the way to a Srinagar hospital,” the official said. A police spokesman said Mr. Qadir “is safe now”.

207,2020/10/07,Rahul’s tractor rally enters Haryana amid high drama,"After his three-day rally spree in Punjab, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday took the party’s ‘tractor rally’ to neighbouring Haryana to extend support to farmers agitating against the Centre’s agriculture sector legislations.

High-voltage drama was witnessed at Haryana’s border with Punjab when the ‘tractor rally’ was stopped for a while with Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja accusing the Haryana police of not allowing Congress leaders and workers to enter the State.

The police, however, dismissed the charges. “Our jurisdiction starts from halfway through the Markandey bridge from where we were supposed to provide a carcade to Mr. Gandhi as per norms of the Z plus security. Our carcade was ready on the bridge on our side of the border... Mr. Gandhi was on a tractor and people who were with him had surrounded it and didn’t let it proceed. Whatever chaos happened occurred on the other side of the border in Punjab,” Rajesh Duggal, Superintendent of Police, Kurukshetra, told The Hindu.

“They had due permission from the District Magistrate and there was no reason why we would stop him,” he added.

After wrapping his public rally at Sanaur in Patiala district, Mr. Gandhi along with party leaders and workers from the Punjab Congress moved towards Haryana. Barricades laid by the Haryana police were thrown by Congress workers who were ahead of the tractor rally, led by Mr. Gandhi. They shouted slogans against the Centre and the State government. As the procession stopped at the border, Mr. Gandhi tweeted, “They have stopped us on a bridge on the Haryana border. I’m not moving and am happy to wait here. 1 hour, 5 hours, 24 hours, 100 hours, 1000 hours or 5000 hours.”

208,2020/10/07,"West Bengal Governor tweets rape, kidnapping figures","Data misleading, says State home department

West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday tweeted the figures of rapes and kidnapping in the State reported in the month of August 2020 triggering a vehement denial by the State’s home department.

“Rapes-223 and Kidnappings-639 @MamataOfficial in August 2020 as per official reports indicate worrisome state of crime against women - a cause of concern. Time to douse fire under feet and put law and order in place @WBPolice @KolkataPolice, before attending flames elsewhere,” Mr. Dhankhar tweeted along with screen shots of a district-wise breakup of crimes in the month of August.

The tweet triggered strong reactions from the home department which took to social media to call the allegations baseless and assert that the figures were not based on official data.

“Rajbhavan dissemination of WB “statistics” on rape and kidnapping is not based on any official report, data, or information. Allegations are baseless, ill-founded, and misguiding: totally incongruous with authentic facts and figures,” the official handle of the home department said from its official Twitter handle.

The Governor responded by calling the tweet a “terrible misrepresentation” and added that all figures are after “due diligence”.

“Stunned@MamataOfficial terrible misrepresentation. Must apologetically withdraw and make amends. Statistics of Rapes-223 and Kidnappings-639 in August 2020 emanate from authentic reports officially sent to me from each of Divisions. All figures after due diligence.” Mr. Dhankhar said.

He also warned that those “responsible for such outrageously incorrect assertions to run down a constitutional office will not be without consequences”. “Such a stance in public interest cannot be countenanced. Action will surely ensue.

210,2020/10/07,Meet India’s vision-impaired photographers who use technology and grit to make their mark,"Ahead of World Sight Day on October 8, we speak to photographers with vision impairment who use the lens to interact with the world

A strip of cloud cut across the sun, over a grand old dormant volcano in Mauritius — a beautiful setting for a picture, thought Pranav Lal, on honeymoon with his wife Sacheta. Being born blind has not stopped this Delhi-based cyber-security specialist from choosing photography as his hobby. Pranav is in fact one among a number of amateur photographers with visual impairments in India.

“The thrill of taking photographs for me is my desire to perceive what I can’t touch. Landscapes, the sky and its clouds, faraway hills and mountain peaks with snow,” says Pranav.

A view of the city, mountains, and the sky from Mauritius Sports Council, photographedby Pranav Lal

He perceives beauty through the sense of sound, using a software, vOICe vision technology that facilitates an augmented reality on his pair of glasses. “It is like an artificial eye, and it works on two levels,” explains Pranav. “First, it takes live camera views and translates them to a defined set of sounds.” So images are converted into stereo sound by scanning them from left to right — the brighter the object, the louder the sound; the greater the elevation, the higher the pitch.

“The second level uses neuroscience. The sound gets converted into electrical impulses in the brain. Your brain cells don’t care where they are getting that data from. When it receives that data, the specialised neurons re-recruit themselves for vision,” he says, explaining how he sees in illusory flashes. “Once I see what I like, I press click on my smartphone camera.”

A view of the sunlit sky, captured by Pranav Lal

The contrast in light is why he loves taking pictures of landscapes and structures. “Water especially gives you a lot of scope to play with reflections. If the light falls on it differently, it will be an entirely different picture.”

Current bionic eyes place such microelectrodes near the optical nerve to create visuals inside the brain. Mumbai-based Bhavesh Patel however uses no advanced equipment for his photography. Yet, he is India’s only fully blind photographer to have shot commercial projects.

Bhavesh Patel at Epic Show India, Pune

Bhavesh has always been interested in the creative fields, especially Art. “I studied in a school in Worli until I was 15, and I remember there was this art gallery nearby. I would go with my uncle and he would visually describe what was there in those paintings.”

In 2009, he had his first tryst with photography, thanks to a group Blind With Camera, helmed by photographer Partho Bhowmick. “He introduced me to a basic Kodak camera. We clicked pictures of the pigeons in Dadar. Whenever they flapped their wings, we would point and shoot.”

A black-and-white photograph capturing the play of light, by Bhavesh Patel

Capturing imagination

When Bhavesh had those developed pictures described to him, it took him back to his childhood memories with his uncle. “It captured my imagination,” he says.

From that first photo of the pigeons taking flight, he moved on to take pictures of Katrina Kaif for Lux, and got paid for it. “That was mostly done with the help of other sighted photographers, who adjusted the lighting and the environment. I had to sense where she was positioned and what she was doing, and click according to that,” he says. However, for Oppo, the shoot was more dynamic. “We travelled to different locations in Delhi to capture different scenarios with an Oppo smartphone.”

Under Blind With Camera, many others like Bhavesh have been experimenting with photography as a hobby. Its founder, Partho, claims to have introduced the camera to over 1,500 Indians with visual disabilities. The group also raises awareness by holding workshops for the sighted in which they are blindfolded and taught to use the camera by people with vision impairments.

One such workshop held in Hyderabad was with Mercedes-Benz, for potential buyers. Vivek Yeralkar, from the group, acted as the mentor, instructing students to use their sense of sound to capture pictures of cars zooming on tracks at a speed of 90 kilometres per hour.

Vivek Yeralkar mentoring students with vision impairments in photography

Staying focussed

Completely blind in one eye and with 10% vision in the other, Vivek used to be a photographer — he recalls the local awards he won with great joy — before he lost his vision due to retinal detachment in 1992.

“Back then I was in Thane, working as an engineer. I would use Vernier callipers and micrometers, but one day I couldn’t see the readings properly.” Several visits to the doctor and a surgery did not help, and he moved back to his parents’ home in Pune. “That year I was very depressed. I had photojournalist friends and it was my dream to be a photographer too, par woh adhura reh gaya (it was left unfinished),” he says.

After getting back on his feet with some computer training and learning to use screen readers, Vivek heard of a Blind With Camera workshop in Goa in 2010. Since then, he has been reacquainted with the lens.

His favourite memory is that of the Kaas Plateau in Satara, where he went two years ago with his son. “There were flowers of so many colours, yellow, violet, orange.”

A picture of the flowers in a valley in Satara, taken by Vivek Yeralkar

Technology has helped him over the years, with most cameras now being equipped with autofocus. The screen reading phone too makes things a lot easier — especially in taking selfies. “Otherwise, before we would have to turn the rear camera and never know if the framing is right.”

Pranav is a huge supporter of using better technology, not just to click pictures, but also to perceive them. “Right now, an exhibition for the blind would probably have audio descriptions. Or they have tactile (raised) pictures. But they are never enough to convey all the details in a photograph,” he says.

This is why he prefers the vOICe vision technology to ‘look’ at pictures. “In fact, the whole reason I started photography is to check if others were looking at the same thing as I was,” he says.

For Bhavesh, the draw of photography is this: “The more you focus on clicking a picture, the more aware you are of your surroundings, the better your judgement. You will understand the world a bit better,” he says. A photograph is a record, proof that you were there, with the world, at that moment in time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/hbk8yu/article32791572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PranavIMG-20190726-WA0018,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/world-sight-day-meet-indian-photographers-with-vision-impairments/article32791575.ece
211,2020/10/07,IPL 2020 | Ashwin let off ‘pal’ Finch,"The off-spinner moots a 10-run penalty for backing up too far

Delhi Capitals (DC) spinner R. Ashwin cited his close friendship with Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) opener Aaron Finch as a reason for not affecting the ‘Mankad’ dismissal in their IPL encounter on Monday.

Like a derailed bogey

Ashwin added that Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting wanted him to run Finch out.

“Going into my jump, I saw a gold helmet (Finch) moving forward like a derailed bogey of a train. I stopped to think whether to run him out or not. Finch didn’t even return to the crease; he just stared at me.

Finch and I played together at KXIP. Finch is a great guy; he is my friend. We spent a lot of time together during our KXIP days. I did the math in my head — it did not work out, so I gave him a final warning,” Ashwin said, on his Youtube channel.

Also read: ‘First and final warning for 2020’, says R. Ashwin

Finch’s offence was so blatant that even Ponting — reportedly not a fan of ‘Mankading’ — reversed his stand.

“I met Ponting after the match. He said, ‘Finch ventured out so far out that I wanted to get up and tell you to run him out’. Ponting said that he is speaking to the ICC Committee, asking for a rule which imposes a penalty for batsmen who leave the crease early,” Ashwin said.

Ashwin stated that imposing a 10-run penalty is the only way to stop batsmen from leaving the crease early.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ky15nw/article32797379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th08ash,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-ashwin-let-off-pal-finch/article32797380.ece

Former Australia batsman Dean Jones has been farewelled in a poignant final lap of an empty Melbourne Cricket Ground following his sudden death last month.

The casket of Jones, who collapsed and passed away aged 59 in Mumbai, was draped in an Australia flag and carried in a white hearse adorned with flowers spelling “324”, his Test cap number and his highest first-class score, achieved at the MCG.

Rocket Man by Elton John — a friend of Jones — echoed through the 100,000-capacity arena as the hearse, followed by only 10 mourners due to anti-coronavirus rules, proceeded around the field on Saturday.

213,2020/10/07,IPL 2020 | Kartik Tyagi is an exciting talent: Jos Buttler,"Star keeper-batsman says the Royals’ top-order needs to fire

Jos Buttler finally was back amongst the runs on Tuesday. But his 44-ball 70 could only soften the blow a bit for Rajasthan Royals from Mumbai Indians at Abu Dhabi.

Buttler, who was in cracking form for Royals in the last IPL, had failed to get going in the first three games. “I hadn’t been feeling my best in the middle,” the England wicketkeeper-batsman said.

Finding his feet

“I still feel like I am finding my form a bit. It was good for me to have spent some time in the middle.

“Hopefully I can take some confidence from today and use that for the rest of the tournament.”

He said Royals had to sort out the issues at the top of the order. “We haven’t managed to come off as a top-order in the last three games,” he said. “We lost three wickets in the PowerPlay... In T20 cricket, you never win too many games from that position.”

One of the few positives for Royals against Mumbai was Kartik Tyagi, the 19-year-old seamer who made a promising debut. “He is really an exciting talent,” he said. “One thing the IPL always does is unearth fantastic young Indian players.”

Praise for Suryakumar

He was all praise for Suryakumar Yadav, whose unbeaten 79 (47b) laid the foundation for Mumbai’s victory.

214,2020/10/07,IPL 2020 | Bumrah was keen to take new ball: Bond,"Mumbai Indians bowling coach Shane Bond has revealed that star pacer Jasprit Bumrah took the new ball and backed his yorkers with renewed vigour against Rajasthan Royals as he was a bit disappointed with his IPL performances so far.

Bumrah, who was having a rather ordinary tournament, was back to his destructive best, claiming a four-wicket haul as his side inflicted a 57-run defeat on Rajasthan on Tuesday.

It was the first time the 26-year-old was handed the new ball in the tournament and Bumrah didn’t disappoint, returning the impressive figures of 4/20, including the prized scalp of Steve Smith.

“Jasprit genuinely wanted to take the new ball so there was a discussion that went on one day before the game against Royals, we obviously have used him in a defensive manner at the back-end of the PowerPlay,” said Bond during the post-match press conference.

“It was a fresh wicket and there was grass on it, he has the ability to nip the ball around, we knew Rajasthan’s key players were in the top-order so we wanted to give him an opportunity to get out there, take the new ball and take some wickets for us,” he added.

Bond said the Indian pace spearhead was unhappy with his performances in the tournament and wanted to make the kind of impact that is expected from a bowler of his calibre. “Jasprit really wanted to back his yorkers against Royals, he wanted to go back to his strengths and use his bouncer as he normally does,” the New Zealander said.

“That’s his strength, if he is not happy with his performances, he tends to bounce back to a new level. I know, traditionally through IPL, Bumrah tends to get better and better,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ajj1rb/article32797227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08BOND-BUMRAH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bumrah-was-keen-to-take-new-ball-bond/article32797228.ece

216,2020/10/07,IPL 2020 | Batsmen hold the key in clash between Kings XI and Sunrisers,"The bowlers of both teams have been disappointing so far

With their respective bowling attacks struggling to find form, Kings XI Punjab and Sunrisers Hyderabad will look to their power-hitters to do the job when the two teams go head to head in the IPL here on Thursday.

KXIP is languishing at the bottom after losing four of its five games, while SRH is sixth following two wins and three losses so far.

KXIP’s strength has been its formidable opening duo. Skipper K.L. Rahul has scored two fifties and a century, while Mayank Agarwal also has a half-century and a three-figure knock to his credit. But despite the solid batting performances, KXIP has been unable to win because of the disappointing bowling attack.

Apart from Mohammed Shami, all the others have failed to take wickets.

The team was unable to defend 223 against Rajasthan Royals. During the 10-wicket loss in the previous outing, the KXIP bowlers were at their wits end as Chennai Super Kings overhauled a 178-run target with 14 balls and 10 wickets to spare.

Come Thursday, Sunrisers, blessed with a strong top order comprising Jonny Bairstow, David Warner, Manish Pandey and Kane Williamson, will look to exploit the KXIP’s bowling unit.

Having lost the opening two games due to the middle order, Sunrisers brought in Williamson to the playing XI. Skipper Warner backed youngsters Abhishek Sharma and Abdul Samad to fill in for the fifth bowler’s slot and it paid off.

However, the team was dealt a massive blow when senior pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar was ruled out of the tournament with a thigh muscle injury.

In his absence, SRH struggled with the bowling. Apart from T. Natarajan, pacers Sandeep Sharma and Siddarth Kaul leaked runs.

Samad was also expensive, which led Warner to turn to Williamson to bowl two overs of off-spin against Mumbai Indians.

Going ahead, there will be added pressure on Natarajan and star spinner Rashid Khan.

The team has the option of playing experienced Afghanistan all-rounder Mohammad Nabi or West Indies’ Fabian Allen but that would mean Willamson sitting out.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cfz9e6/article32797174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08MANDEEP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-batsmen-hold-the-key-in-clash-between-kings-xi-and-sunrisers/article32797176.ece
217,2020/10/07,"Indian Premier League 2020 | Super Kings lose the plot, Knight Riders hold their nerve","Pursuing 168, the Chennai side slips up from 99 for one; Rahul Tripathi’s 51-ball 81 sets up the Kolkata team’s 10-run win

Chennai Super Kings squandered a good start and stumbled in its chase, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders by 10 runs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.

Chasing 168 for victory, CSK was 90 for one at the end of 10 overs before KKR fought back strongly, led by Sunil Narine, to record its third win of the season.

Good platform

Shane Watson continued his good run from the previous match, scoring 50 (40b, 6x4, 1x6) as he set a good platform with Ambati Rayudu (30).

But once the two were dismissed in quick succession, first Rayudu followed by Watson — leg-before to Narine — the game slipped away.

Vital wickets

The West Indian spinner was ably supported by Kamlesh Nagarkoti, C.V. Varun and Andre Russell, all of whom chipped in with crucial wickets.

The CSK middle-order looked out of sorts, as M.S. Dhoni, Kedar Jadhav and Sam Curran struggled to get the remaining runs.

It was a puzzling decision by the team management to send an out-of-form Jadhav (7 n.o., 12b, 1x4) ahead of powerful hitters such as Dwayne Bravo and Ravindra Jadeja.

Boundaries dry up

CSK could not strike any boundaries between the 11th and 15th overs, scoring only 20 runs.

Earlier, Rahul Tripathi justified his promotion to the top of the order by smashing a 51-ball 81 (8x4, 3x6) and guiding KKR to a respectable score of 167.

Led by leg-spinner Karn Sharma’s brilliant spell (4-0-25-2) in the middle overs, CSK came back strongly. Karn, who replaced Piyush Chawla, was playing his first match of the season.

In top gear

Tripathi, who shot into the limelight in the 2017 IPL as an opener for Rising Pune Supergiant, made full use of the opportunity to go after the bowling in the PowerPlay.

After being hit for a six by Tripathi in his opening over, Karn made a grand comeback. He varied his length and pace cleverly and did not concede another boundary in his spell.

Pulling things back

The Kolkata side, at 93 for two after 10 overs, was well placed for a strong finish. But CSK medium-pacers Shardul Thakur (two for 28), Curran (two for 26) and Bravo (three for 37) ensured that KKR’s momentum was arrested.

In the end, however, KKR had enough runs on the board to hand CSK its fourth defeat of the season.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gpa747/article32797146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAHULKBjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-kolkata-knightriders-vs-chennai-super-kings-at-abu-dhabi/article32796128.ece
218,2020/10/07,"Indian Premier League 2020 | Suryakumar’s shot-making was perfect, says Rohit Sharma","Royals skipper Steve Smith blamed the top-order for their third straight loss.

Shot selection was letting Suryakumar Yadav down in earlier games but his Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma said it was perfect against Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.

Suryakumar Yadav was back among the runs after he blazed his way to an unbeaten 79 off just 47-balls, propelling Mumbai Indians to an imposing 193/4. Then their bowlers led by Jasprit Bumrah bundled out Rajasthan Royals for 136 to carve a 57-run win.

“It (a big knock) was coming, I spoke to him (Surya) before the game as well. He was batting really well all these games. He got off to a good start and it was just about making sure, you know, that the shot making sometimes can be very very important and today his shot-making was perfect.

“We wanted him to bat till the end because of those innovative shots that he has, it was quite handy towards the end,” Rohit said at the post-match presentation.

He also said the pitches in the UAE were conducive to the pacers and it was good to see his bowlers exploit the conditions well.

“When we knew that the IPL is going to happen in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, we were not sure how the pitches were going to be, whether the pace-battery we have got will be helpful or not. But coming here and looking at the pitches here, it is quite helpful for the seamers.

“Today it was nipping around to start with and towards the end as well, so good to have guys like those (the pacers) in your squad who can exploit the conditions very well, said Rohit.

Royals skipper Steve Smith blamed the top-order for their third straight loss. “Obviously, losing wickets early does not help us. We haven’t been able to get off to a good start in the last three games. So outside of Jos (Buttler) and Jofra (Archer) in the end there, we have got to do a bit of work with our batting, I’m sure,” Smith said.

“I don’t think we need to panic too much. It is just about implementing our plans and playing some good cricket for longer, we have not been able to do that in the last three games and we got to turn that around quickly.”

Smith also informed that swash-buckling English all-rounder Ben Stokes won’t be available till October 10.

220,2020/10/07,Maharashtra to decide on reopening schools only after assessing situation,"Educational institutions told to stop collection of development fees, says minister

While the Union Education Ministry has issued guidelines to States on the reopening of schools and colleges from October 15, Maharashtra Minister of Higher and Technical Education Uday Samant on Tuesday said that in the current pandemic situation in the State it was not conducive to do so.

The Minister hinted that Maharashtra would be reopening schools and colleges only after assessing the COVID-19 situation.

“The decision to open up colleges will have to be based on the current spread of COVID-19 in the State… Maharashtra’s pandemic situation has not yet normalised. Hence, it will not be appropriate to physically conduct classes,” Mr. Samant said after a review meeting of preparations for final year exams with the authorities of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). He said that he had directed educational institutions to stop the collection of development fees from students as there had been no physical classes for the last few months.

Stating that the final year examinations would be conducted while taking due care of the health of the students, Mr. Samant said that two-and-a-half lakh students would be appearing for the final year examinations under the SPPU.

“Of them, two lakh students will be taking the exams online. The rest 50,000 students will be writing the exams offline,” Mr. Samant said, adding that all provisions had been made to ensure that students do not encounter any technical problems while taking their exams and that no student would be deprived of the exams. The disabled students will be get 20 extra minutes to complete their papers.

“For those appearing physically at the 113 exam centres, zilla parishad and Pune civic body authorities must ensure that the facilities are properly sanitised,” he said.

Mr. Samant further said that practice question papers would be given from October 8 while a grievance redressal centre would be set up to deal with any problem students might encounter.

However, a number of students across the State, especially in rural areas, are apprehensive about their online exams with several complaining about technical glitches, hall tickets, and power failure among others.

“About 60% of the students appearing for the final year examinations are from the rural areas. They face a range of problems from erratic electricity supply to poor range for mobile phones. Already, students appearing for Mumbai University’s final year exams have been bedevilled with poor internet connectivity and power outages with server failure and phones hanging in the middle of their examinations,” student leader Kuldeep Ambekar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/30hzmq/article32787211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BMSTUDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/maharashtra-to-decide-on-reopening-schools-only-after-assessing-situation/article32787212.ece

The footpath along the iconic Spencer’s Road in Udhagamandalam, which had become damaged, is being repaired by the Highways Department.

The stretch from Charring Cross to the District Collector’s office is a part of town very popular with tourists visiting the district, many of whom walk along the pathway. Over the last few years, the pathway had become damaged while the guard-railing running alongside the pathway had also become damaged.

Officials from the National Highways said that the pathway is being re-laid with the guardrails being replaced with ones made of stainless steel. “The work on re-laying the pathway is being done alongside the widening of a bridge near the Farmers’ Market in Charring Cross, with the project costing ₹10 crore,” said an official.

The footpath is also being laid with pipe ducts that will allow wires and other infrastructure to be routed through the pathway without the need for the pathway to be excavated in the future, officials said.

The Udhagamandalam Municipality is also repairing sections of road within the town. The minor repair works are being conducted along major roads within the town, while parks such as the Davis Park, which was in need of urgent renovation after being neglected for the last few years will also be cleaned, officials said.

The fence to the park had been damaged and allowed tipplers to use the premises without authorization, which had led to the accumulation of garbage and waste inside the premises. The Davis Park, along with other parks and roundabouts within the town will be repaired, officials from the municipality said.

The work is being done in preparation for the visit of the Chief Minister Edappadi K.

In an effort aimed at expediting the progress of projects taken up under the Smart Cities Mission, the Coimbatore Corporation has fixed fortnightly and monthly targets for contractors.

Corporation Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian held a meeting a couple of days ago with engineers, project management consultants and contractors to review the progress in model road, lake development, multi-level car parking and other Smart Cities Mission works.

At the meeting, he asked the contractors to divide the projects into small components to fix targets for each of those components and fortnightly and monthly targets and stick to those to complete the project in time, said Deputy Commissioner S. Madhuranthagi.

Sources that participated in the Monday’s review meeting said the Commissioner had asked the contractors to complete the model road work, taken up on D.B. Road, R.S. Puram, by December 2020.

Likewise, he had asked the contractor executing the multi-level car parking project, again on D.B. Road, by January 2021. Though the contractor had asked for time till June 2021, the Commissioner said it would be better if the revised deadline was January 2021, the sources said.

As for the timeline for projects taken up to beautify and rejuvenate the lakes in the city, the Corporation wanted the contractor to complete the projects taken up at Valangulam, Ukkadam Big Tank (Periyakulam) and Selva Chinthamanai tanks December 2020. The sources said that the Corporation stuck to the deadline though the contractor had asked for an extension by a month or two considering the North-East Monsoon, the sources said.

The Corporation had revised deadline very much keeping in mind the impact of COVID-19 lockdown and the impact of monsoon on the tank work.

Nevertheless, the Corporation stuck to the deadline because it had floated the tender more than two years ago and wanted the works complete to showcase them to the public.

As for the deadline for model road project on Race Course and lake development project on Kurichi tank, there was no change as the Corporation had floated tenders only less than six months ago, the sources added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fv0ck5/article32797470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB08-WORK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-corporation-fixes-fortnightly-monthly-targets-for-contractors/article32797472.ece

232,2020/10/07,"Delhi riots were ‘big conspiracy’ to disturb country, says MoS Nityanand Rai","The Minister of State for Home was addressing RAF troops on the occasion of the Force’s 28th anniversary, or Raising Day, at a Central Reserve Police Force camp in Gurugram.

The riots in Delhi this year were a “big conspiracy” to disturb the country but security forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) played an important role in “suppressing the elements that spread anarchy” during the time, Union Minister Nityanand Rai said on Wednesday.

The Minister of State for Home was addressing RAF troops on the occasion of the Force’s 28th anniversary, or Raising Day, at a Central Reserve Police Force camp in Gurugram. The RAF is a special anti-riot wing of the CRPF and was raised in 1992.

“A big conspiracy was deployed to disturb the country through the Delhi riots that took place this year. The RAF played an important role in suppressing the elements that spread anarchy and ensured peace,” Mr. Rai said in his address to the troops.

He added that RAF personnel had “completely defeated” the nefarious designs of the rioters.

“You suffer damage and injury during riots and protests...but you use force only when violent groups start troubling the peace of society,” the Minister added.

The RAF was deployed during the communal violence that broke out in northeast Delhi in February, killing 53 people and injuring about 200. Delhi Police has filed multiple chargesheets before a Delhi court in these cases.

The RAF has 15 battalions (over 15,000 personnel) based in various parts of the country. Union Home Minister Amit Shah also greeted RAF personnel on the occasion. “Greetings to RAF personnel and their families on their 28th anniversary. RAF has distinguished itself in dealing with the challenges relating to law and order,” the Minister said on Twitter.

“Time and again, their commitment in several humanitarian works and UN peacekeeping missions has made India proud,” he added.

Mr. Rai, who reviewed a parade of the RAF personnel at the CRPF academy, said maintaining internal security and peace are “two very important” factors for the development of a country.

He lauded CRPF personnel for killing top commanders of terror groups operating in the Kashmir valley and said the force has worked to defeat “Pakistan sponsored” terrorist activities in that region. “These are big achievements made by you,” he said.

CRPF Director General A.P. Maheshwari also addressed his troops and said security forces and special units such as the RAF now have a new challenge in the form of fake and inciting messages spread through social media.

“Earlier, the protests were supposed to be countered in the physical space but now we see radicalisation being spread through cyber space,” Maheshwari said. He added that his force is prepared to tackle these new challenges.

Maheshwari said the CRPF will undertake a mega awareness campaign on COVID-19 related protocols in the country. The aim, he added, is to reach about 12 crore citizens.

“A meeting was held in the Home Ministry yesterday...it was decided that a campaign underlining three things, wearing a mask, washing hands and ensuring social or physical distancing, should be ensured by everyone to check the coronavirus spread.”

“All the security forces, including the CRPF, will undertake this campaign in their respective areas. We aim to get in touch with 12 crore people through our 1,600 bases in the country over the next 100 days,” the DG said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l94d8x/article32621689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Nityanand-Rai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-riots-were-big-conspiracy-to-disturb-country-says-mos-nityanand-rai/article32795301.ece

234,2020/10/07,Interfaith pair seek removal of objection provision in Special Marriage Act,"Delhi High Court seeks response from Union government

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought a response from the Union government on a petition by an interfaith couple seeking to do away with the provision of inviting objection from public while applying for marriage registration under the Special Marriage Act (SMA).

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan also issued notice to the Delhi government on the petition.

The duo, who are currently housed at an NGO here, seek their marriage to be registered immediately.

All marriages done under the SMA require publication of the names of the couple for inviting objections from the public for 30 days. Within this period, anyone can object to the marriage on the ground that it would contravene one or more of the conditions specified in section 4 of the SMA.

Some of the conditions include that neither party has a spouse living; either of them is of unsound mind, incapable of giving a valid consent; and the male has completed the age of 21 and the female the age of 18.

The petition stated that the 30-day gestation period was not warranted as the same objective could be mitigated on the basis of certificates issued by government hospitals and on the basis of an undertaking by them.

The question with regard to whether either party had a living spouse could arise in other religious marriage also, but they were exempted from the 30-day notice period, advocate, Utkarsh Singh, for the couple, argued.

Quashing of sections

The petition sought to quash section 6 and 7 of the SMA, which mandate the publication of the public notice, on the ground that it was unreasonable and arbitrary.

It claimed that the law commission had urged a reduction of this period to bring the procedure in line with all other personal laws, where registration under the Hindu Marriage Act could be attained in a day and signing of a ‘Nikahnama’ also conferred the status of husband and wife on a couple immediately.

“The 30-day period offers an opportunity to the kin of a couple to discourage an inter-caste or inter-religion marriage”, it said.

The 28-year-old man, belonging to the Hindu religion, was working in a pharmacy firm in Delhi, while the 26-year-old woman from the Muslim religion is pursuing her B.Ed. They met during graduation from Delhi University in 2011.

Mr. Singh said that his clients’ inter-religion relationship had led to various difficulties, with resistance from their respective parents.

During the lockdown, when parents of the woman started finding a match for her, the pair decided to marry on their own. “The petitioners applied for solemnising their marriage under the SPA, but under the fear if consequences of public notice that may arise in 30 days, they opted out of it”, the petition said.

Later as the situation in the house of the woman got worse, the twosome moved to a house provided by NGO Dhanak of Humanity. The petition stated that they had reapplied for marriage under the SPA as they did not want to change their religion or names for the sake of marriage.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6mzb7/article32791400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Special-Marriage-Act,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/inter-faith-pair-seek-removal-of-objection-provision-in-special-marriage-act/article32790987.ece

239,2020/10/07,"Not getting MSP for produce, allege farmers","APMC says FCI under Centre not buying from markets since 2015; BKU writes to CM

Farmers from different villages in Delhi alleged that they are not getting the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce in markets and many times, suffer losses despite the Delhi government promising higher prices than the MSP.

“A week ago, I sold about 17 quintals of bajra for ₹1,250/quintal to a middleman in Najafgarh mandi. The MSP is more than ₹2,100. But we do not get that rate and there is no government control at the mandi. Also, the government does not buy from us,” said 65-year-old Ram Kumar, a farmer from Kharkhari Jatmal village in Delhi.

Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Delhi in-charge Virender Dagar said the Delhi government had promised them Swaminathan Committee rates for their produce, which is higher than the MSP, but they do not even get the MSP.

Naresh Kumar, Chairman of Najafgarh Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), where farmers go to sell their produce, said the FCI (Food Corporation of India) under the Centre has not been procuring any produce from Delhi’s markets since 2015. He said they have written multiple letters to the FCI on the same, but in vain.

“The Delhi government has no power to buy produce from farmers and it has no storage. If FCI buys from the farmer, then they will buy at MS. But now when a private person buys, farmers do not get the MSP in most cases,” Mr. Kumar said. He said the farmers are suffering losses because of this problem.

On Tuesday, the BKU gave a memorandum to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the issue and he has promised to look into the matter.

Panel report

In February 2019, the Delhi government had said they have “conceptualised” the implementation of recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee report on farmers that “MSP should be at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production” under a scheme — Mukhya Mantri Kisan Mitra Yojna.

An “Agriculture Conference on Implementation of Recommendations of Swaminathan Committee” was also held by Development Minister Gopal Rai. The proposed MSP, with 50% margin at the cost of production, was ₹2,616/ quintal and ₹2,667/quintal for wheat and paddy respectively.

“The proposed MSP structure is higher than the Government of India MSP by ₹776/quintal for wheat and ₹897/quintal for paddy. It is likely to incur an additional liability of ₹96.38 crore, if implemented,” an official statement had said. The FCI was supposed to buy produce from the farmers at the new higher MSP and the Delhi government was to give the extra amount to the Centre. But the scheme did not work out as FCI is not buying the produce, according to Delhi government officials.

Mr. Kumar and other farmers said their counterparts in Haryana were getting the MSP of ₹2,150/quintal for bajra. “After all my expenses in ploughing, sowing, cost of manure and cutting, I am losing money by selling it at ₹1,250/quintal. But what can I do?” said the farmer, who owns two acres of land.

Kamal Singh, 60, from the same village said he had sold 27 quintals of wheat at ₹1,680/ quintal, which is less than the MSP of ₹1,925/quintal of 2019.Many others from the village had similar complaints and said that always middlemen buy from them.

Yogesh Phalswal, 25, of Ghumman Hera village said bajra is being sold for around ₹1,400/quintal and they do not get MSP. He also showed a WhatsApp message of the purported rates of different produce being sold in the market and all prices in the list, expect for rice, was lower than MSP.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved verdict on a plea of senior journalist Vinod Dua seeking quashing of FIR lodged against him for sedition and other offences by a local BJP leader in Himachal Pradesh over his YouTube show.

A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Vineet Saran, after hearing arguments for Mr. Dua, Himachal Pradesh government and the complainant in the case, asked the parties to file written submissions in the matter within three days.

On July 20, the top court had extended till further orders the protection granted to Mr. Dua from any coercive action in the case.

The top court had said that Mr. Dua need not answer any other supplementary questions asked by Himachal Pradesh police in connection with the case.

On July 7, the top court had extended the protection to him from any coercive action and sought a report in a sealed cover on the probe conducted so far by the state police.

An FIR against Mr. Dua under provisions of Indian Penal Code for offences of sedition, public nuisance, printing defamatory materials and public mischief was lodged by BJP leader Shyam at Kumarsain police station in Shimla district on May 6 and the journalist was asked to join the probe.

Mr. Shyam has alleged that Mr. Dua, in his YouTube show, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of using “deaths and terror attacks” to get votes.

Earlier, in an unprecedented hearing conducted on a Sunday on June 14, the top court had granted protection from arrest to Dua till further orders. However, it had refused to stay the ongoing probe against him.

It had asked Dua will have to join the investigation through video-conferencing or online mode as offered by him in his response to the summons issued by the police seeking his personal appearance.

Besides seeking quashing of the FIR, Mr. Dua, in the plea, has sought “exemplary damages” for “harassment”.

He has also sought direction from the apex court that “henceforth FIRs against media persons with at least 10 years standing be not registered unless cleared by a panel to be constituted by every State government, the composition of which should comprise of the Chief Justice of the High Court or a Judge designated by him, the leader of the Opposition and the Home Minister of the State.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sc-reserves-verdict-on-vinod-duas-petition-in-sedition-case/article32786962.ece

“It is the inherent right of the Legislature to examine matters of public importance... This is a matter of great public importance going to the very foundation of the day-to-day functioning of the NCT of Delhi,” the Assembly, represented by advocate Shadan Farasat, explained.

Live broadcast

Its affidavit submitted on October 5 said the Committee had summoned Mr. Mohan as a witness. There was no coercive action against him. The committee proceedings are conducted in the “most transparent manner with live broadcast”.

“A witness cannot claim his right to silence or to be let alone in response to the summons to depose before a lawful Committee of an empowered legislature,” the affidavit contended.

The Assembly said Mr. Mohan had attended the proceedings of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on September 2, 2020.

“The plea of the petitioners claiming right to silence and violation of other fundamental rights in the present petition is therefore, non-genuine and not in good faith, having appeared before another Legislature knowing fully well that he does not have a right to silence before a committee of a legislature,” the affidavit said.

It said the right to remain silent was relevant only in a criminal investigation.

“The proceedings before a committee of the Legislature are not criminal or judicial proceedings. There is no accused before a committee,” the affidavit said.

The affidavit said it is a matter of “common knowledge through news reports available in the public domain that even internationally, serious questions have been raised on the role of Facebook platform as a mechanism to disseminate hate and divisiveness that have destroyed and damaged entire communities such as in Myanmar and Sri Lanka”.

“Committee on Peace and Harmony had received multiple complaints/representations addressed to its chairman Raghav Chadha, underscoring the alleged instances of inaction/inability on the part of social media platform - Facebook to enforce its policies against inflammatory and hateful contents. It was alleged in the complaints/representations that even in respect of Delhi riots in February 2020 a lackadaisical approach of Facebook was visible,” the affidavit said.

The affidavit came in a petition filed jointly by Mr. Mohan and Facebook against the summons issued by the Committee. It said the Assembly had threatened Mr. Mohan with breach of privilege if he did not comply. Mr. Mohan was summoned to appear before the Committee on September 23. The meeting was deferred when the case reached the apex court.

The court had asked the Assembly to not proceed further with the Facebook official. The next court hearing is on October 15.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/no-coercive-action-against-facebook-official-delhi-assembly-tells-sc/article32786929.ece
244,2020/10/07,PIL initiated to monitor cases against MLAs,"High Court asks Centre, Delhi government and its own registry to respond

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre, Delhi government and its own registry to respond to a case initiated by it on direction of the Supreme Court to all High Courts to immediately hear long-pending criminal cases against sitting and former legislators.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked all the respondents to submit their affidavits indicating the steps taken pursuant to the top court’s direction.

On September 16, the apex court had asked the Chief Justices of all High Courts to list before an appropriate Bench all pending criminal cases involving sitting and former lawmakers, where stay was granted.

4,400 trials held up

Over 4,400 criminal trials have been held up, some for decades, because the powerful MPs and MLAs had approached the High Courts and got an interim stay. Some date back nearly 40 years. Most are stuck at the stage of framing of criminal charges. These cases range from corruption to money laundering, the top court had said.

“There are about 175 cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act and 14 cases are pending under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 against sitting/former legislators,” the order had noted.

There are over 2,500 criminal cases against sitting legislators alone, it had said. The top court has directed that there should not be any unnecessary adjournments. The hearings should proceed on a day-to-day basis.

247,2020/10/07,‘Will begin use of bio-decomposer from Oct. 11’,"CM makes announcement after visit to facility; many farmers wary but ready to try

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that the government will start spraying “bio-decomposer” in the fields to decompose straw and stubble left in the fields after harvesting. The solution turns the straw and stubble into manure and is seen by the government as a solution to avoid burning them.

The Chief Minister made the announcement after visiting a facility in Kharkhari Nahar village, where the bio-decomposer capsule which was developed by Pusa Institute, is made into a solution through a week-long process.

Creating a model

Development Minister Gopal Rai, who was also present, said that though people say there is not much stubble burning in Delhi, the government is using this bio decomposer in Delhi and creating a model, so that other States cannot make any excuses for burning stubble. “If Delhi can make a centralised system and do it, then other States can also do it. It depends on how serious they are. Delhi will get benefit only when Punjab and Haryana will use this,” Mr. Rai said.

“The entire process of creating the solution to spraying it on the fields across the entire Delhi costs only around ₹20 lakh. I hope this will prove to be an effective alternative for the neighbouring States as well,” the Chief Minister said.

Meanwhile, farmers of two villages The Hindu met are wary since they can only sow wheat or mustard about 20-25 days after the government sprays the solution and said they doubt whether the time gap may affect their next crop.

Sell straw

About a dozen farmers from two villages and a farmer’s association told The Hindu said that they do not burn the stubble in Delhi and also the crop is cut by labourers not using machines.

There are two kinds of waste after harvesting: one is the straw left behind after threshing and taking out the grain. And the second is the stubble which is left attached to the ground, along with the root system, after harvesting. The burning of both of them is broadly termed as stubble burning.

In Punjab and Haryana, the crop is cut mostly by combine harvesters, which leaves a longer stubble attached to the ground. Farmers burn it as they cannot plough them back into the Earth very easily. In many cases, they also burn the straw as it is not sold or used as fodder for animals.

“Last year, we sold straw of one acre after harvesting for about ₹3,000. We even sell them to other villagers who use it as fodder for cows after mixing it with straw of jowar or bajra,” said Surender Singh, 45, a farmer from Kharkhari Jatmal village. Singh said that he was ready to try the new solution on the stubble standing on the ground after selling the straw.

Many other farmers had a similar opinion.

But he was wary. “Last year, I sowed wheat in December as the harvesting of paddy was late. Half of my seeds did not germinate and I ended up losing a lot of money. I hope the spraying won’t delay my next sowing,” the farmer said.

A group of farmers gathered at the spot said the bio-decomposer will be more useful in Haryana and Punjab where the farm waste is burnt.

Nithin Phalswal, 27, from Ghumman Hera village said that he would allow spraying only in half of his farm land close to a canal where sowing is done a little late. “If I allow in the other half and I get delayed for sowing and the soil moisture decreases, then the seeds won’t germinate,” he said.

Most farmers said that the government is yet to contact them for the procedure.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/3q11v5/article32786880.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06DELPRIYAKEJRIWAL11,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/will-begin-use-of-bio-decomposer-from-oct-11/article32786881.ece

Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri also expressed concern over the non-payment of fees for children of the Economically Weaker Category (EWS) in schools run by the Delhi government and demanded that their fees should be deposited urgently so that no child is removed from school.

“The Delhi government has removed 5,600 re-employed teachers while about 5,000 guest teachers have not been appointed. On the other hand, the posts of 9,000 teachers in various government schools are lying vacant,” Mr. Bidhuri said.

The Leader of Opposition said that the Delhi High Court has already directed that no posts of teachers should remain vacant. Despite this, he said, the posts of about 20,000 teachers in Delhi schools are lying vacant. According to Mr. Bidhuri, the last time large scale appointments of teachers were made was when Sahib Singh Verma was the Delhi Chief Minister with additional charge of education.

249,2020/10/07,Call for sacking Adityanath gets louder,"Women’s organisations demand safety and security of Hathras victim’s family

National Federation of Indian Women, along with Pragatisheel Mahila Sangathan and ANHAD demanded the sacking of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath after visiting Hathras on Monday.

A delegation comprising NFIW’s national general secretary Annie Raja, PMS’ general secretary Poonam Kaushik and activist Shabnam Hashmi met the rape victim’s family and doctors and other staff in Aligarh, where the victim underwent treatment before being shifted to Delhi.

The team demanded that Mr. Adityanath be sacked from the CM’s post “for deteriorating condition of constitutional bodies and growing violence against women, especially Dalits”. They also demanded enquiry into the diversionary narrative propaganda, suspension of the District Magistrate, safety security and livelihood of the family. “We demand that NHRC should investigate why all the dissent is being criminalised,” they said in a statement.

Talking about the “narrative” being propagated claiming that the victim was not raped, the team said that an offence has been committed by revealing the girl’s identity by the head of BJP IT cell who shared a video of the victim. “In the video, when the victim was asked why they strangulated her, she says because she was resisting ‘zabardasti’. ‘Zabardasti’ is used for sexual assault and this video is of the police station in Hathras. Such efforts of the government and the BJP in trying to shield the perpetrators are highly condemnable,” they said.

Voice of dissent

The team also condemned filing of cases against protesters and said that all acts of dissent is now being termed as conspiracy to malign “the BJP and its State governments”. “They have forgotten that it is every citizen’s right under the Constitution to raise his/her voice against injustice,” they said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7mm7vb/article32786866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL07-ANNIERAJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/call-for-sacking-adityanath-gets-louder/article32786867.ece

Delhi Police’s counsel had stated that polygraph test of two of the suspects have been conducted and of the other three suspects is yet to be conducted. “The same could not be conducted on account of the lockdown. As soon as the polygraph tests are resumed at the facility in Ahmedabad, the said tests of the other three suspects should also be conducted,” the counsel had said.

“Let the narco analysis test of the three remaining persons be conducted either at Ahmedabad or at Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital as soon as the said facility becomes operational,” the court ordered.

252,2020/10/07,SC judgment today on Shaheen Bagh protests,"Apex court’s verdict is of significant import for stirs in future

The Supreme Court on October 7 will pronounce its judgment about balancing the right to protest against the right to public movement in the background of the marathon protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Shaheen Bagh.

Shift anti-CAA protesters

A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul will deliver judgment on a petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni, several months ago, for a direction to shift the anti-CAA protesters of Shaheen Bagh, mostly mothers and their children, to an alternative site as they have been “blocking” public movement and causing traffic snarls in the area.

The protesters were later removed by the police on March 24 with the advent of the pandemic and the resultant national lockdown.

The protesters had at the time written to Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde against the “forcible and vindictive removal of the protest site” by the Delhi Police.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued that the right to protest, like any other right, was not “absolute”. Justice Kaul had orally said in a parliamentary democracy the avenue of debate was first Parliament.

In addition, peaceful protests could be held.

Mr. Sahni had said though the reason for the petition — the blockage of the main road by Shaheen Bagh protesters — had become infructuous, the court should still pass specific orders that “in future, protests should not hinder public movement”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5wb29y/article32789799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sc-judgment-today-on-shaheen-bagh-protests/article32789800.ece

Telangana High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Central and State governments in a PIL petition seeking direction for establishment of ‘State Council for Clinical Establishment’.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, after hearing contentions of the petitioner, instructed the State government to file a counter affidavit within four weeks. The petition was filed by a voluntary organisation Forum Against Corruption president Vijay Gopal. He stated in the plea that the Centre had brought out Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act-2010. It was notified by the Parliament on February 28, 2012. While many States did not adopt the Act, Telangana State adopted it by passing a resolution in the Assembly on March 25, 2017. The petitioner contended that as per Section 8 of the Act, the government should create a State Council for Clinical Establishments. Not creating the council had created a situation where people availing services of private hospitals found no system to redress their grievances, the petitioner said.

Mr. Vijay Gopal sought a direction to State government to constitute ‘District Registering Authorities’ as per the Act along with setting up State Council for Clinical Establishments. He asked the court to direct the government to release the approved standard list of medical procedures for treating different patients. The petitioner said the government should also release standard template for costs of medical procedures as approved by the National Council for Clinical Establishments as per rule 9 (ii) of the Act. In some cities, hospitals were being operated illegally. There was no mechanism to look into allegations of excessive charges being imposed on patients. There is no system of ensuring adequate facilities by such hospitals set up in districts.

Patients and their families are in a state of confusion as to whom they should approach to secure justice, he said. The petitioner requested the court to direct the government to create Enforcement Cell to ensure every provision of the Act was complied with by the government.

South Central Railway (SCR) has taken up the task of upgrading maximum permissible speed in the sections of ‘Golden Quadrilateral/Golden Diagonal (GQ/GD) routes’ including the sections of Balharshah - Kazipet - Vijayawada - Gudur, Vijayawada- Visakhapatnam and Wadi- Gooty - Renigunta sections to 130 kmph.

Existing maximum permissible speed between Balharshah - Kazipet - Vijayawada and Kazipet -Secunderabad is about 120 kmph, while it is 110 kmph between Vijayawada - Gudur and Wadi -Gooty - Renigunta sections. These routes are under the process of speed upgradation up to 130 kmph as decided by the Railway Board, informed General Manager Gajanan Mallya on Wednesday.

Railway Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO/Lucknow) had already conducted ‘oscillation trials’ through ‘Confirmatory Oscillograph Car Run’ (COCR) consisting of 24 coaches of all classes. During this check, the engineering teams travelling in these special inspection trains check for the signalling, traction distribution equipment, locomotive and coach fitness.

Trial runs were conducted in July between Balharshah - Kazipet - Secunderabad and Gooty - Renigunta sections. Works pertaining to upgradation of these routes to required standards like sturdier rails, improvement of curves, gradients and other components in double line electrified routes are under way, he said.

Chief Public Relations Officer (CPRO) Ch. Rakesh said about 260-metres-long welded rail panels are being laid to improve track structure. Trial runs are also being carried out in the remaining sections of Kazipet - Vijayawada - Gudur & Wadi - Gooty sections with the track strengthening and other infrastructure enhancement already in progress to meet the specified standards.

Once all the infrastructure improvements are done, a detailed report will be sent to the Commissioner of Railway Safety (Secunderabad circle) for getting necessary permissions to enhance the maximum permissible speed of all these routes to 130 kmph. Mr. Mallya pointed out that increasing the trains speed in these important sections of Golden Quadrilateral/Golden Diagonal routes will definitely boost the operation of passenger and freight trains. “As the running time of the passenger services can be drastically reduced, it will pave the way for running more number of trains,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/scr-strengthening-infra-to-run-trains-at-130-kmph/article32797239.ece

Ms. Seethakka, along with TPCC spokesperson Indira Shobhan and a team of Congress workers, visited the girl in the hospital, said it was unfortunate that not a Minister or even a MLA has visited the family even after 18 days of the horrific incident.

She said the government did not even shift the girl with 70% burns to a private hospital for better treatment. “This government is blind and deaf to the rape of a dalit girl and it is shameful that none from the government has responded so far,” she remarked.

The girl was allegedly set ablaze after she resisted rape by the son of the house owner where she is a domestic help in Khammam. According to the police, on September 18 the girl was at her employer’s home when his son tried to rape her. As she resisted and tried to escape, the accused allegedly poured kerosene on her and set her ablaze. The accused family allegedly misled the girl’s parents saying she suffered burns while lighting a lamp and also promised compensation.

She was shifted to a private hospital in Khammam for treatment and the police was informed later by the girl’s parents.

263,2020/10/07,TRS seeks support of elected members of local bodies in Nizamabad,"KTR asks them to ensure a big win to the party candidate K. Kavitha in MLC poll

Working president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) K.T. Rama Rao has urged the electors of Nizamabad Local Authorities Constituency in the Legislative Council – elected representatives of rural and urban local bodies – to ensure big win for the party one more time.

Speaking in a virtual meet with the electors on Tuesday, he alleged that some parties were running a misinformation campaign against TRS unable to digest the good work being done by its government. He, however, stated that TRS was strong enough to face such forces including those trying to pursue communal politics.

Stating that Nizamabad had been the strength of TRS since inception of the party, Mr. Rama Rao said the party had started its indomitable journey with a unanimous election in Mothe village of the district about two decades back and hoped that it would continue further. He sought the support of local bodies elected members keeping in mind the good work being done by the government for the last six years on all fronts including the efforts being made to make agriculture remunerative.

He stated that the government was planning special food processing zones in the district to provide value addition to the agricultural produce in the district to ensure better returns to farmers. He noted that TRS had been opposing the new legislations brought in by the Centre recently harming the interests of the farming community. The party was also against the electricity amendment bill that was against providing free power to farmers.

Reminding them about the commitment of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to improve the lives of all sections of the society, Mr. Rama Rao asked MPTC and ZPTC members and councillors and corporators to support TRS candidate K.

Minister for Municipal Administration & Urban Development (MA&UD) K.T.Rama Rao has asked the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) officials to prepare proposals for several more sewage treatment plants (STPs) to fulfil the needs of the city.

During a review meeting on Tuesday, Mr.Rama Rao asked them to ready proposals for new STPs to treat 1200 million litres of sewage water per day (MLD) in addition to the existing ones with a capacity of 770 MLD.

Already Hyderabad has the highest capacity of sewage treatment facilities among all other cities in the country, the minister said, and instructed that the STPs should be aligned with the Musi river cleaning project.

He asked the officials to submit a report to the government with all details about the construction of STPs based on the Hyderabad Master Sewerage Plan, within a week.

Speaking about the upcoming Keshavapuram reservoir project works, Mr.Rama Rao said land acquisition for the reservoir has reached completion stage. Close to 1490 acres of land is being acquired for the reservoir which is expected to assure sufficient drinking water for Hyderabad till 2050.

He asked officials to expedite the process for obtaining stage-II Forest clearances for the reservoir, in view of the stage-I clearances already accorded. Foundation for the reservoir will soon be laid from the hands of the chief minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao, whose dream it is to see the city without water scarcity, he said.

The Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) has come out with a start-up grant to encourage researchers and students develop products and services useful in the fight against COVID-19.

The assistance is part of the start-up grant set up by the university with financial assistance under the Centre’s RUSA (Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan) to help students and researchers convert their innovative ideas into full-fledged ventures.

The grant will be managed by Cusat-TBI under the Cusat Tech Foundation formed by the university for entrepreneurship development, employability enhancement, and to promote innovation. About 40 lakh will be disbursed as grant in multiple instalments, according to an official release.

COVID-19 response grant is exclusively for the development of products and services specifically useful in the fight against the pandemic. The final outcome of the work should be ‘development of a prototype/formulation/process/Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which can be scalable for deployment.’

Idea grant

The varsity had received applications under the idea grant for potential start-ups having a brilliant idea or research output, which the innovators wanted to scale-up to a commercial level. The product grant for start-ups is meant for those who have completed their prototype and are seriously looking at final product development before hitting the market.

The screening of application forms were done by an expert panel set up by Vice Chancellor K.N. Madhusoodanan and it comprised academicians and industry experts. Twenty-four start-ups under various domains such as electronic hardware, biotechnology, marine science, polymer and software applications were recommended by the committee initially.

The university has plans to upgrade its Technology Business Incubator to a state-of-the-art facility with assistance under RUSA. It will provide infrastructural facilities for start-ups and also support innovators to make the best out of the facilities and resources available on the campus. An additional space of 3,000 sq.ft. has already been allotted at the Students’ Amenity Centre and sanction will be given for the construction of another 10,000 sq.ft.

269,2020/10/07,Dip in revenue of Registration dept.,"Though operations are back to normal, number of registrations in Ernakulam are yet to touch pre-lockdown levels

The pandemic has dealt a severe blow to the government’s revenue through the Registration Department in the district, with the number of registrations and the resultant income dropping significantly.

The district has a total of 25 sub registrar offices and they collectively recorded 6,427 registrations accounting for ₹56.45 crore in March, towards the fag end of which the State went for a lockdown that lasted over two months.

In February and January, the registrations and resultant revenue were pegged at 7,625 and ₹63.11 crore, and 7,790 and ₹63.92 crore respectively.

With restrictions in place and registration limited to 10 a day in each office, the number of registrations in April nosedived to an unprecedented low of 479, generating revenue of ₹6.45 crore.

Though the operations are back to normal, the registrations are yet to touch pre-lockdown levels. In May, 4,379 registrations were held netting ₹43 crore, whereas in June and July, the numbers were 5,292 and ₹44.21 crore and 5,048 and ₹43.62 crore.

August has so far registered the biggest post-lockdown revenue of ₹48.88 crore from 4,931 registrations. However, it remains a far cry from ₹59.70 crore, ₹59.56 crore and ₹65.28 crore in the last three months respectively of 2019. During those three months 7,276, 7,356, and 7,107 registrations were done in the district.

The registration of sale deeds, reflecting property transactions and the biggest revenue grosser for the Department, remains particularly dented.

In March, the revenue from sale deed registration stood at ₹47.11 crore, a fall from ₹52.49 crore in February and ₹54.62 crore in January. In the last three months of 2019, the revenue on this count was ₹50.67 crore, ₹52.37 crore and ₹56.69 crore respectively.

In April it plummeted to ₹5.70 crore, before rising to ₹35.37 crore in May, ₹37.36 crore in June, ₹38.06 crore in July, and ₹41.68 crore in August.

Registration of gift deeds, settlement deeds, exchange deeds, partition, release, mortgage and lease deeds accounts for other major transactions and source of revenue.

Stamp paper shortage

The shortage of stamp papers has also affected registrations. Senior Revenue Department sources attributed it to logistical problems in sourcing stamp paper from the Nashik press, owing to the proliferation of COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra. It had been dealt with and the shortage would be resolved shortly, said sources.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/dip-in-revenue-of-registration-dept/article32787183.ece
270,2020/10/07,A glimpse into Thrikkakara’s past,"Cartoonist Sudheer Nath’s blog posts create nostalgia in times of pandemic

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues its terrifying march across the world, people are finding solace and a means of survival in collective memory. Closer home, the popularity of blog posts titled “Thrikkakara Sketches” underscores that nostalgia can bolster survival efforts in the midst of uncertainties and anxiety.

The man behind the blog, cartoonist Sudheer Nath, who is based in New Delhi, said he began posting “Thrikkakara Sketches” on Atham day (August 22 last).

Having been born and brought up in Thrikkakara, he wanted to make up for his inability to travel home for Onam celebrations with a few posts on local history and the importance of the Thrikkakara temple, which is at the centre of the Onam legend.

“Though I wanted to conclude after 10 posts, the overwhelming response forced me to continue as people coaxed me, giving suggestions, providing material and sharing their memories,” he said. At one time, the number of readers used to rise to 50,000 a day, he said about the 38 posts from August 22.

A street scene of Thrikkakara in the early 90s.

Thrikkakara Sketches comprise a wide variety of topics ranging from the itinerant circus shows that arrived here every year, to the Onam celebrations at the Thrikkakara temple. There are also posts on the first bus that people in Thrikkakara relied on and the toddy and arrack shops frequented by the locals.

Mr. Nath said that stories of ordinary people evoked a tremendous response and generated a considerable number of comments from readers. Writing about a popular barber of yesteryear as well as about the tea shops brought lots of comments, he said.

“Though we’ve had movies on villages, there has not been such a variety of topics dealt with in the writings on the past life of a place,” said Pratheesh V. Vijayan, a young filmmaker in Kochi who regularly reads Thrikkakara Sketches. Senior psychiatrist Philip John said people were living through a period of anomie and anticipatory anxiety.

271,2020/10/07,Small players lose ground,"Till about a year ago, Vidyasagar T.K., a small-time real estate agent, used to make a decent living from buying and selling properties.

But then, business went off the boil and the outbreak of the pandemic sealed his fate. After nearly three decades in the field, Mr. Vidyasagar is now a non-player, dependent on the meagre income from his photostat shop at Nedumbassery that is not doing brisk business either.

“I used to buy plots along with three others and then sell it in small parcels for small margins. The progressive increase in fair value over the years had already driven small players like us out of business when the pandemic erupted and hit our fortunes,” he said.

K.S. Suresh Kumar, district secretary of All Kerala Document Writers and Scribes Association, lamented how the fair value of land had gone up by 50% in last five years, with 10% rise in every State budget, making property deals in general untenable. “The 10% stamp and registration duties meant that a property deal worth ₹10 lakh attracts a duty of ₹1 lakh. The demand for pegging these duties at 5% like many other States has gone unheeded,” he said. Paul T.C., another small real estate broker, said while the impact of the pandemic was temporary, the real deal-breaker for the sector was the demonetization of 2016 from which the sector never really recovered. “While the property deals have dried up, the land price, especially in urban areas never really dropped. Land largely remains with the wealthy class and they are not willing to sell it at throwaway prices,” he said.

Joy Antony, who runs a website for property deals, however, claimed that there was a mini-surge for newly-built medium houses and small plots among expatriates forced to return in the wake of the pandemic. “We are receiving many such enquires, probably because expatriates have advanced their plans to buy houses and invest in land. Besides, they are no longer able to stay with their relatives or extended family on return as in the past owing to the quarantine protocol,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/small-players-lose-ground/article32787151.ece
272,2020/10/07,Stalemate over Thripunithura bypass leaves landowners in a quandary,"Ban on sale and renovationof properties has been in effect for the past 30 years

There seems to be no end in sight to the burgeoning traffic hold-ups in and around Thripunithura and on the Kundannoor-Pettah stretch, with the three-decade-old stalemate over constructing the Thripunithura bypass set to continue.

The proposal to construct the 8-km bypass dates back to 1989. The project remained in the cold storage except for four hectares of the total 16 hectares of land being acquired, after paying what landowners termed as a pittance as compensation to them. Currently, landowners are in a quandary. They are unable to sell their land, renovate houses or build new ones since the land for the alignment remains frozen. Officials of the PWD (NH wing) said that the land acquisition cost had increased manifold during the past years. “This is among the reasons why the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has not prioritised the project. Else, the State government would have to pool in 50% of the project cost. Efforts to develop the corridor in a phased manner too have not yielded results”.

The proposed bypass passes through three parliamentary constituencies and as many Assembly constituencies. “I raised the demand to hasten the project in the Lok Sabha since the land owners are unable do any transaction of their properties. The bypass stretch would have worked wonders in developing the entire area. A Project Director of NHAI visited the area recently to assess the situation. Apart the long-overdue alignment, an alternative one through Puthencruz, located further away, is being looked into,” said Benny Behanan, MP.

Among the people affected by the inordinate delay in implementing the project is A.T. Geevarghese. “The project was initiated when I was 10 years. Now I am 40, and little has materialised,” he said, while expressing his willingness to surrender his land for the project.

Another landowner, V.G. Ambujakshan, a native of Mamala and State president of the National Federation of the Blind, said that his long wait for the bypass remained unanswered although he had surrendered over 8 cents of land and his house for the project. “I got a measly amount as compensation back then. The alignment was changed multiple times at the behest of influential people who did not want to surrender their land. This resulted in adding many curves in the alignment, despite safety hazards. Our efforts to convince PWD officials and others with the help of satellite images to carve out the alignment through alternative lands proved futile”.

Landowners were unable to modify their houses even during the wedding of their children due to the uncertainty over the project. A bypass beyond Thripunithura town would also be crucial from the safety point of view since mega industrial units such as the KRL were located close-by. The existing narrow roads were too congested, he said.

“I am unable to do anything on 60 cents of my 1 acre land that the PWD identified for acquisition for the project. The government must speed up land acquisition,” said T.C. Varghese, a resident of Sasthamukal.

Natarajan, secretary of the Thiruvankulam Action Council for Thripunithura Bypass, said that the long pending bypass was of strategic importance too since it would link Kochi, which has the Southern Naval Command and a host of other defence establishments, with Dhanushkodi through Madurai.

He cautioned against changing the alignment since it would result in motorists having to travel up to 14 km of additional distance for no reason.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/65qney/article32787123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06KI-BYPASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/stalemate-over-thripunithura-bypass-leaves-landowners-in-a-quandary/article32787124.ece
273,2020/10/07,Port witnesses 24% fall in throughput,"Number of ships calling at Kochi too records decline

With COVID-19 continuing to disrupt trade and business across the globe, the Cochin Port Trust saw a fall in cargo throughput as well as in the number of ships calling at the port.

During the first half of 2020-21, the port handled a total of 12.58 million tonnes. This is a decline of more than 24% in cargo volumes as compared to the same period during 2019-20.

Petroleum, oil, and lubricants throughput stood at 7.20 million tonnes, and containerised cargo movement stood at 2.85 lakh TEUs in the first half of the year. With the continuing disruption in normal movement of vehicles and suspension of air services, petroleum product movement declined nearly 34% this financial year when compared to the same period last year. Decline in container movement is around 9% when compared to the fist six months of 2019-20.

However, the first half ended on a positive note for the port, with cargo movement registering nearly 10% growth in September. This is the first time during the pandemic days that cargo throughput is showing a positive trend, port sources said. Some signs of recovery were visible in the volume of containers being handled at the International Container Transshipment Terminal at Vallarpadam. The negative trend in container cargo has shown a slowdown, even as the container terminal notched up record handling of the highest volume of cargo for a single month in September this year. The terminal handled 62,472 TEUs of cargo during the month.

Meanwhile, the port trust has invited expression of interest (EoI) from investors with experience in port, shipping, or logistics businesses for developing the NCB berth and back-up areas on public-private partnership basis/landlord model. The project is aimed at bringing cargo and vessel traffic to the port. The port trust said those interested were encouraged to offer innovative business suggestions for the proposed venture, contributing to an increase in business through projects like warehouses, tank farms, and bulk cargo storage silos.

The port is also open to considering developing any other berths besides the NCB depending on the business potential.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/port-witnesses-24-fall-in-throughput/article32787098.ece

278,2020/10/07,"Closure of Palarivattom underpass hardly affecting traffic, claims study","Attribute it to the decline in the number of vehicles in the wake of the prohibitory orders in place or the effectiveness of the traffic re-routing arrangements, either way, the closure of the Palarivattom underpass for the demolition of the flyover seems to have hardly disrupted the traffic.

In fact, traffic flow at the underpass this Monday, the first working day since the traffic restrictions kicked in, compared to the last Monday was much less as per a comparative study put out by the traffic police.

The study looked at the traffic flow to the Palarivattom bypass junction from all four directions – Edappally, Kakkanad, Vyttila, and Palarivattom – through the peak morning hours between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. and evening peak hours between 4 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. During none of the time slots, the traffic through the underpass this Monday matched with that of the previous Monday.

As per the study, before the closure of the underpass, the biggest surge in the traffic flow from the Edappally side to the underpass was witnessed between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. and 6.45 p.m. From the Kakkanad side, the traffic flow was almost uniformly hectic between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. and between 5.15 p.m. and 6.15 p.m.

Traffic flow to the Palarivattom underpass from the Vyttila side peaked between 9.30 a.m. and 10.45 a.m. and then between 5.30 p.m. and 6.45 p.m. whereas from the Palarivattom side it peaked between 10 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. and 5.15 p.m. and 7.15 p.m.

However, since the closure of the underpass, the traffic flow was uniformly sedate except for a minor surge from the Palarivattom side during the time slots of 6 p.m. and 6.15 p.m. though even that was no match to the traffic during the same time before the closure of the underpass.

Signal at the Palarivattom bypass remains switched off and direct movement across the junction to Kakkanad and Palarivattom remains banned. The traffic police have knocked down the median immediately after the junction en route to both Vyttila and Edappally, opening up a wider U-turn facilitating smooth passage even for bigger vehicles headed to both Palarivattom and Kakkanad respectively.

“The relatively narrower U-turns before Oberon Mall and Ernakulam Medical Centre during similar restrictions in the past used to hold up traffic. Further, cones have been intelligently used to facilitate seamless movement of oncoming vehicles and those taking the U-turns,” said a cop deployed for regulating traffic.

However, indiscriminate speeding by motorists ignorant about the U-turns poses a potential threat of accidents, especially during nights, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/closure-of-palarivattom-underpass-hardly-affecting-traffic-claims-study/article32786722.ece
279,2020/10/07,Kochi to have new fleet of e-autos soon,"Vehicles to hit roads of West Kochi, Elamkulam, and Kadavanthra

The city might soon have another fleet of electric autorickshaws to improve last-mile connectivity.

The Kochi Corporation signed a joint declaration of intent with the Ernakulam Jilla Autorickshaw Drivers’ Co-operative Society (EJADCS), an umbrella group of six trade unions of autorickshaw drivers, to run about a 100 e-autos as a pilot project.

The e-autos will hit the roads of West Kochi (all 28 divisions), Elamkulam and Kadavanthra. A study by GIZ (the German Agency for International Cooperation), which is offering technical support to the corporation in implementing the project, had identified these areas as being poorly connected to and from bus stands and metro stations. Some of these areas, a few with narrow roads, including several parts of West Kochi, are not quite connected by public transport, the study had found.

The project is part of the civic administration’s Integrated Sustainable Urban Transport Systems for Smart Cities (SMART-SUT) scheme detailed in the current financial year’s budget.

An e-auto network would both help reduce carbon emissions, ensure better connectivity in some parts of the city and offer a pocket-friendly mode of transport, Mayor Soumini Jain said in a release. The EJADCS will purchase the vehicles and run the share e-autos along fixed routes that are not part of regular bus and metro routes.

In addition to the subsidy offered by State and Union governments for purchase of electric vehicles that the cooperative society can claim, the Kochi Corporation will also be able to offer financial support through the funds the local body will receive for the project from GIZ and UN Habitat. The remaining amount will be funded through a loan taken by the society. GIZ will also fund the charging infrastructure and the auto stands that the corporation will set up.

The society would rent the e-autos out to drivers, said M. B. Syamandabhadran, president, EJADCS.

Depending on the success of the pilot project, the corporation is likely to scale it up to about 1000 e-autos.

The team implementing the project had been waiting for the COVID-19 situation to ease up before launching the e-autos out of fear that the drivers might not find regular commuters with the pandemic, sources associated with it said. The upcoming local body elections could also delay the project and the funds the corporation is set to receive. They were, however, hopeful of implementing the project by February next year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kochi-to-have-new-fleet-of-e-autos-soon/article32786715.ece
280,2020/10/07,College freshers get a taste of ‘new normal’ amidst pandemic,"Institution in Kochi shoots online sessions at various locations on campus to familiarise newcomers with facilities

The pandemic crisis seems to have opened up a unique experience for freshers on campuses here.

The worsening COVID-19 situation has robbed them of the sheer excitement of walking into their new classroom and having a great time with their new friends. Instead, videos of their classrooms and laboratories shown online and freshers’ day being held in Google Meet or Zoom platforms have become the new normal.

“It is a fact that we missed the first day in our college in the face-to-face mode. But there is no other option now in view of the pandemic. But we are getting accustomed to this new experience, where everything is happening in front of our computer or mobile screen,” said students of B.A. Economics and English, who had joined autonomous colleges in the city.

Autonomous institutions had started classes for first-year students nearly two weeks ago while the admission process in government and aided arts and science colleges under the Mahatma Gandhi University is progressing. Prasant Palakkappillil, Principal of Sacred Heart College, Thevara, said that the initial online sessions for freshers were shot at various locations across the campus to familiarise them about the various facilities available on the campus. “We had organised family meetings and interactions among students aimed at making them at ease with the new normal,” he said.

Lizzy Mathew, Principal of St. Teresa’s College, said that freshers’ day was celebrated online with senior students welcoming newcomers. “We have also started online sessions, where first-year students will get an opportunity to present their talents ranging from literary and culinary to arts and music,” she said. Managements are planning to opt for the blended learning mode by combining both online and offline sessions even after colleges reopen for the traditional face-to-face sessions. Some of the colleges are toying with the idea of providing lectures online and using the offline mode for discussion and interactions on the lectures aired through videoconferencing platforms. Colleges have also stepped up the infrastructure for online learning by installing state-of-the-art teaching tools and systems.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/college-freshers-get-a-taste-of-new-normal-amidst-pandemic/article32786685.ece
281,2020/10/07,Week-long online music programme in memory of virtuoso Neyyattinkara Vasudevan held,"More than 40 musicians from different places in India and abroad participated in the fête

With over a lakh views and musicians joining in from all over the world, this year’s anniversary fête in memory of maestro Neyyattinkara Vasudevan was a different experience altogether for musicians, music buffs and organisers.

Instead of a grand concert and a lecture that are usually organised by Manirang, the Neyyattinkara Vasudevan Foundation, to pay homage to the musician, the organisers decided to go in for a week-long online programme from September 21 to 27 in view of the pandemic and curbs on the number of people attending a function.

“We invited Vasudevan sir’s disciples, their students and certain select musicians to participate in the programme. Their recitals were posted on Facebook and the number of views came as a boost to our morale,” says eminent Carnatic vocalist Sreevalsan J Menon, Neyyattinkara Vasudevan’s prime disciple.

In addition, veteran musicians like TH Subramanium who wanted to offer tribute to Neyyattinkara Vasudevan also participated in the fête. “It turned out to be an online gathering of musicians of different generations. Laila Sashikumar, Vasudevan sir’s disciple who rendered Tyagaraja’s ‘Intha Soukya’ in Kapi, was perhaps the senior-most while Anjana A who sang ‘Jalandhara Supeedasthe’ in Valachi was the youngest. Senior vocalist Ayamkudi Mani, who had been taught by sir, recalled sir’s teaching method and how each class was special. Since the recitals are there on Facebook, anyone can go back to listen to them,” explains Sreevalsan.

The organisers had given a time limit to each of the singers and they were requested to begin their performance after saying a few words to pay homage to the late virtuoso.

As Edappally Ajithkumar points out before his melodious violin recital, Neyyattinkara Vasudevan was among the handful of Carnatic musicians from Kerala who had carved a niche for themselves without moving away from the State. Moreover, his programme Karnataka Sangeeta Paatam on All India Radio proved to be a guide and eye-opener for students of classical music in the State.

Subbulakshmi Krishnamoorthy, Vidhu Vijay, Anish Ram, Anand Subramanium, Gayathri Devi Vijayakumar, Kollam Balamurali and Latha Prasad were some of the vocalists who participated in the programme. Saranya Ozhukil, Sreevalsan’s student, tuned in from the US with the soulful Swathi kriti ‘Saramaina’ in Behag, while ghatam exponent Vazhappally R Krishnakumar played ‘Tamburee mettidava’ on the ghatam.

Thodupuzha Manoj Kumar, who used to accompany the legend on the violin, was among the senior musicians who participated.

“It was a first for us and we were not sure how it would pan out. Contrary to our expectations, it turned out to be a huge success and now we are planning to see if it can be made an annual feature along with the concert and lecture,” says Sreevalsan, who performed a duet with his son, Narayana Menon.

He adds that even after the official conclusion of the ‘remembrance week’, musicians from all over the world were sending musical notes of love and affection as a mark of respect for Neyyattinkara Vasudevan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/oo2udg/article32793449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08MPTVMNEYYATTINKARA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/week-long-online-music-programme-in-the-memory-of-neyyattinkara-vasudevan/article32793450.ece
282,2020/10/07,"Johnny Nash, singer of 'I Can See Clearly Now,' dies at 80","Nash, who had been in declining health, died of natural causes at home in Houston, the city of his birth

Johnny Nash, a singer-songwriter, actor and producer who rose from pop crooner to early reggae star to the creator and performer of the million-selling anthem “I Can See Clearly Now,” died Tuesday, his son said.

Nash, who had been in declining health, died of natural causes at home in Houston, the city of his birth, his son, Johnny Nash Jr., told . He was 80.

Nash was in his early 30s when “I Can See Clearly Now” topped the charts in 1972 and he had lived several show business lives. In the mid-1950s, he was a teenager covering “Darn That Dream” and other standards, his light tenor likened to the voice of Johnny Mathis. A decade later, he was co-running a record company, had become a rare American-born singer of reggae and helped launch the career of his friend Bob Marley.

Nash praised “the vibes of this little island” when speaking of Jamaica, and he was among the first artists to bring reggae to U.S. audiences. He peaked commercially in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when he had hits with “Hold Me Tight,"" “You Got Soul,” an early version of Marley’s “Stir It Up” and “I Can See Clearly Now,” still his signature song.

Reportedly written by Nash while recovering from cataract surgery, “I Can See Clearly Now” was a story of overcoming hard times that itself raised the spirits of countless listeners, with its swelling pop-reggae groove, promise of a “bright, bright sunshiny day” and Nash’s gospel-styled exclamation midway, “Look straight ahead, nothing but blue skies!"", a backing chorus lifting the words into the heavens.

The rock critic Robert Christgau would call the song, which Nash also produced, “2 minutes and 48 seconds of undiluted inspiration.”

Although overlooked by Grammys judges, “I Can See Clearly Now” was covered by artists ranging from Ray Charles and Donny Osmond to Soul Asylum and Jimmy Cliff, whose version was featured in the 1993 movie “Cool Runnings.” It also turned up everywhere from “Thelma and Louise” to a Windex commercial, and in recent years was often referred to on websites about cataract procedures.

""I feel that music is universal. Music is for the ears and not the age,” Nash told Cameron Crowe, then writing for Zoo World Magazine, in 1973. “There are some people who say that they hate music. I’ve run into a few, but I’m not sure I believe them.”

The fame of “I Can See Clearly Now” outlasted Nash’s own. He rarely made the charts in the years following, even as he released such albums as “Tears On My Pillow” and “Celebrate Life,” and by the 1990s had essentially left the business. His last album, “Here Again,” came out in 1986, although in recent years he was reportedly digitizing his old work, some of which was lost in a 2008 fire at Universal Studios in Los Angeles.

Nash was married three times, and had two children. He had loved riding horses since childhood and as an adult lived with his family on a ranch in Houston, where for years he also managed rodeo shows at the Johnny Nash Indoor Arena.

In addition to his son, he is survived by daughter Monica and wife Carli Nash.

John Lester Nash Jr., whose father was a chauffeur, grew up singing in church and by age 13 had his own show on Houston television. Within a few years, he had a national following through his appearances on “The Arthur Godfrey Show,” his hit cover of Doris Day’s “A Very Special Love” and a collaboration with peers Paul Anka and George Hamilton IV on the wholesome “The Teen Commandments (of Love).” He also had roles in the films “Take a Giant Step,” in which he starred as a high school student rebelling against how the Civil War is taught, and “Key Witness,” a crime drama starring Dennis Hopper and Jeffrey Hunter.

Nash convinced his manager and business partner Danny Sims, with whom he formed JAD Records, to sign up Marley and the Wailers, who recorded “Reggae On Broadway” and dozens of other songs for JAD. Nash brought Marley to London in the early 1970s when Nash was the bigger star internationally and with Marley gave an impromptu concert at a local boys school. Nash’s covers of “Stir It Up” and “Guava Jelly” helped expose Marley’s writing to a general audience. The two also collaborated on the ballad “You Poured Sugar On Me,” which appeared on the “I Can See Clearly Now” album.

After the 1980s, Nash became a mystery to fans and former colleagues as he stopped recording and performing and rarely spoke to the press or anyone in the music industry. In 1973, he told Crowe that he anticipated years of hard work- “What I want to do is be a part of this business and to express myself and get some kind of acceptance by making people happy.”

A quarter century later, he explained to The Gleaner during a visit to Jamaica that it was “difficult to develop major music projects” without touring and promoting and that he preferred to be with his family.

""I think I’ve achieved gratification in terms of the people I’ve had the chance to meet. I never won the Grammy, but I don’t put my faith in things of that nature,” he added. “A lifetime body of work I can be proud of is more important to me. And the special folksy blend to the music I make, that’s what it is all about.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ijwqko/article32790567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2633263,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/johnny-nash-singer-of-i-can-see-clearly-now-dies-at-80/article32790568.ece
283,2020/10/07,Guitar rock legend Eddie Van Halen dies of cancer aged 65,"Van Halen is among the top 20 best-selling artists of all time, and the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007

Eddie Van Halen, the guitar virtuoso whose blinding speed, control and innovation propelled his band Van Halen into one of hard rock’s biggest groups, fueled the unmistakable fiery solo in Michael Jackson’s hit “Beat It” and became elevated to the status of rock god, has died. He was 65.

A person close to Van Halen’s family confirmed the rocker died on Tuesday due to cancer. The person was not authorized to publicly release details in advance of an official announcement.

With his distinct solos, Eddie Van Halen fueled the ultimate California party band and helped knock disco off the charts starting in the late 1970s with his band’s self-titled debut album and then with the blockbuster record “1984,” which contains the classics “Jump,"" “Panama” and “Hot for Teacher.”

Van Halen is among the top 20 best-selling artists of all time, and the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. Rolling Stone magazine put Eddie Van Halen at No. 8 in its list of the 100 greatest guitarists.

Eddie Van Halen was something of a musical contradiction. He was an autodidact who could play almost any instrument, but he couldn’t read music. He was a classically trained pianist who also created some of the most distinctive guitar riffs in rock history. He was a Dutch immigrant who was considered one of the greatest American guitarists of his generation.

The members of Van Halen - the two Van Halen brothers, Eddie and Alex; vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist Michael Anthony - formed in 1974 in Pasadena, California. They were members of rival high school bands and then attended Pasadena City College together. They combined to form the band Mammoth, but then changed to Van Halen after discovering there was another band called Mammoth.

Their 1978 release “Van Halen” opened with a blistering “Runnin’ With the Devil” and then Eddie Van Halen showed off his astonishing skills in the next song, “Eruption,” a furious 1-42 minute guitar solo that swoops and soars like a deranged bird. The album also contained a cover of the Kinks’ ""You Really Got Me” and “Ain’t Talkin’ ‘Bout Love.”

Mike McCready of Pearl Jam told Rolling Stone magazine that listening to Van Halen’s “Eruption” was like hearing Mozart for the first time. “He gets sounds that aren’t necessarily guitar sounds - a lot of harmonics, textures that happen just because of how he picks.”

Van Halen released albums on a yearly timetable - “Van Halen II” (1979), “Women and Children First” (1980), “Fair Warning” (1981) and “Diver Down” (1982) - until the monumental “1984,” which hit No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album charts (only behind Michael Jackson’s “Thriller""). Rolling Stone ranked “1984” No. 81 on its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s.

""Eddie put the smile back in rock guitar, at a time when it was all getting a bit brooding. He also scared the hell out of a million guitarists around the world, because he was so damn good. And original,” Joe Satriani, a fellow virtuoso, told Billboard in 2015.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ofs5qx/article32787228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OBITEDDIEVANHALEN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/guitar-rock-legend-eddie-van-halen-dies-of-cancer-aged-65/article32787229.ece

285,2020/10/07,Coronavirus | Kolkata caught between festivities and fear of COVID-19,"Healthcare system is already under strain ahead of festive season

How bad is the COVID-19 situation going to get — this question appears to be uppermost on the minds of many people in Kolkata, where the healthcare system is under strain at a time when the city is all set to open up for festivities.

On October 15, theatres across the city and rest of West Bengal will open. As many as 12 Bengali films — perhaps the highest ever — are set to be released on that day. While a few of them were intended for a Puja release, a few others were supposed to be released earlier but could not be because of the lockdown. Theatres, of course, will have to follow procedures — only 50% occupancy, staggered shows, audience giving their phone number for contract tracing, and so on — but people would still be at risk.

The opening of the theatres will be followed by Durga Puja, which is barely two weeks away, and since the State Government has given its go-ahead for the celebrations to be held — albeit with some restrictions — people are now out shopping. A recent picture from the well-known footwear store, Sreeleathers, is being shared widely on social media: it can be seen packed with shoppers.

The scene is hardly different in other well-known stores where shoppers traditionally flock before Puja. If one were to discount the masks — which, in most cases, either sit below the nose or under the chin — it would seem life is normal.

The scene, however, is very different in hospitals. There is even panic in some places, such as the iconic Medical College on College Street. On Tuesday, its principal sent an SOS to the Director of Health Services, urgently asking for more doctors.

“Presently, 26 post-graduate trainees including 12 faculty members have tested positive for COVID-19 and are either quarantined or undergoing treatment. As such, the Medical College is facing an acute shortage of doctors with the enhancement of 100 beds. Hence [I request] you to post/detail senior residents with specialisation in MD (medicine), preferably ex-students of this institution, to cater effective and adequate care to patients admitted [here],” the principal wrote.

Said Dr. Punyabrata Gun, convenor of West Bengal Doctors’ Forum: “So many doctors getting infected is a serious matter. It becomes more serious as we are anticipating a manifold rise in the number of cases after Durga Puja. There will be acute shortage of human resources.”

According to him, the situation had almost come under control in Kolkata, with the numbers dropping in the city but rising in the districts, but after Mahalaya and Vishwakarma Puja, the graph climbed up again. “We fear the number of cases will again rise after Puja,” Dr. Gun said.

On Tuesday, West Bengal recorded the highest number of daily deaths so far: 63. The number of daily cases recorded in the State continues to hover a little over 3,000.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/u2uk65/article32793244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN07KOLKATAMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/kolkata-caught-between-festivities-and-fear-of-covid-19/article32793003.ece

Amid protests against the farm Acts, the Congress government in Rajasthan has started making arrangements of seeds and fertilizers for the rabi crops after an assessment of the farmers’ needs in different regions. Instructions have been issued for taking strict action against adulteration and black marketing of agricultural inputs.

The sowing season for rabi crops in the State extends from mid-October to November-end. Agriculture Minister Lalchand Kataria said here on Tuesday that monitoring would ensure availability of certified seeds, urea, diammonium phosphate and single superphosphate in sufficient quantities.

Farmers in the northern districts have been protesting against the farm Acts passed in the Parliament, while taking a pledge to not allow private companies to take over their land and agricultural produce on the pretext of contract farming.

Mr. Kataria gave instructions for ensuring the supplies first to the regions in eastern parts of the State, where preparations were in full swing for sowing of mustard in a 30-lakh hectare area. “The information about availability of farm inputs will be conveyed through Kisan Call Centres and other forums,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/rajasthan-to-provide-seeds-fertilizers-for-rabi-crops/article32786869.ece

Engineers and employees of the Uttar Pradesh power department on Tuesday called off their agitation after the State government agreed to put on hold its plan for dissolution and privatisation of the power distribution company Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited.

Under the U.P. Vidyut Karmachari Sanyukt Sangarsh Samiti, the employees of the power department had launched an agitation and boycotted work, leaving many parts of East U.P. without electricity on Monday and Tuesday.

288,2020/10/07,Meet the designer who moved his boutique to a luxury hotel,"Vivek Karunakaran’s new boutique at the Hyatt Regency is an example of how the pandemic is pushing designers to be inventive

Designer Vivek Karunakaran is functioning out of a five star hotel. On the surface, it all sounds glamorous. But in the undertaking of this project lies a sacrificed dream.

In December last year, Vivek moved into his new boutique on Rutland Gate, a glitzy 1,500 square feet space. “I held on to the space for a long time. But after five months of uncertainty, I had to take a tough call and close it,” says Vivek.

However, the situation pushed him to reinvent. Now, his boutique is at the Hyatt Regency, in a cosy 500-square-feet hotel room. The bed has been moved, a little space has been converted into a changing room, and racks bearing his collections occupy much of the room.

Given the times, Vivek says his new retail set-up at the Hyatt is operationally more convenient than a standalone store, as “the hotel in its trademark manner handles the nitty gritties like maintenance and generator, among others.”

Says Vivek, “The idea came up in conversation with Tarun Sethi, general manager of the hotel, and we are excited about exploring this option.”

For now, he is meeting customers by appointment only. “We sanitise the space after each appointment,” he states.

With a studio in Neelankarai, Vivek says that he requires a space in the city to meet clients. “In this new generation, this is how we roll... We are trying to figure out if luxury can be reinvented.”

His clients have been trickling in every other day.

289,2020/10/07,"From the looms, for men and children","Gaurang Shah expands his online portfolio with handloom collections for men and children

Textile designer Gaurang Shah who specialises in handlooms, strengthened his online presence (gaurang.co) earlier this year to entice buyers seeking the safer option of an online purchase as opposed to store visits during a pandemic. Handloom saris and ensembles for women are the label’s mainstay. However, diversifying into clothing for men and children, Gaurang has also launched portals to address these categories (men.gaurang.co and little.gaurang.co).

The collections in all three categories are made possible by more than 800 weavers and craftspeople who work with the label. The catalogue for men includes Gaurang’s signature handwoven bandi jackets, kurtas and sherwanis with traditional motifs and contemporary textures: “There was a strong demand from my clients to expand my signature to menswear, and I thought this is the right time to launch them,” says the designer.

Some of the pieces have involved months of weaving using jamdani technique. Various textures have been created infusing yarns such as khadi, muga silk, tussar silk and organza.

The Little Gaurang section has clothing in handwoven fabrics using natural dyes for children in the age group of 0 to 12. “The fabric that touches a child’s skin matters, since their skin is delicate. Our clothing is as natural as it can be, without harmful chemicals and synthetic fabrics,” adds Gaurang.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/kabofc/article32790656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/gaurang-menswear-1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/gaurang-shah-expands-his-online-portfolio-with-handloom-collections-for-men-and-children/article32790660.ece
290,2020/10/07,Call to defer mandatory permanent admission to UG courses,"Parents point to monetary loss in terms of fee payment

Demand is rife to defer the plan to have compulsory permanent admission to undergraduate (UG) courses in colleges affiliated to Calicut University until the allotment process following the Kerala Engineering Architecture Medical (KEAM) entrance test is completed.

The compulsory allotment for UG courses is expected to follow the second allotment process, which began on Wednesday afternoon. Candidates are bound to take permanent admission to colleges up to October 15 by submitting transfer certificates (TCs) and remitting fees as mandated by the respective institutions.

Permanent admission is reported to be compulsory for all students, even though they are not happy with the current allotted option. Those students who got their last option also need to complete the admission process by the deadline. Otherwise, they will lose their chance in the allotment process.

However, parents point out that when students get a new option in the third allotment or community admission or go for KEAM admission, they will obviously lose the fees already paid. They will also have to get new TCs from the colleges. Apart from monetary loss, it will force students to move around offices, which is at best avoidable in the current pandemic situation, a section of teachers believes.

In this context, P. Rasheed Ahmed, Syndicate member of the university, urged Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj to continue the online allotment process until at least 95% of seats under the Directorate of Admissions are filled and claimed by students. Mr. Ahmed said the procedures should be fine-tuned to serve the best interests of stakeholders. Even students who have the higher option now will be compelled to take admission in colleges. However, at least 10,000 students are likely to move away after the culmination of the KEAM allotment process.

Thus, students should also be given online facilities to relinquish the admission, if they are joining other institutions. Community admission should begin only after completing at least one permanent admission. Students should be given editing facility before the second allotment, Mr. Ahmed added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/call-to-defer-mandatory-permanent-admission-to-ug-courses/article32797832.ece
291,2020/10/07,50% of sellers resume business at Palayam market,"Quick Response Teams at work to ensure flawless protocol implementation

Around 50% of vegetable and fruit sellers at the Palayam market in Kozhikode resumed business on Wednesday, complying with the COVID-19 protocol. Quick Response Teams and policemen were deployed in the area to oversee the flawless implementation of regulations and adopt instant action against health protocol violators.

Only traders who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 were allowed to resume business. There were several shoppers who could not make use of the relaxations, as their workers were in quarantine. At the same time, a few elderly traders voluntarily kept away from reopening shops.

The market had remained shut for over a fortnight after 232 persons, including traders and labourers, tested positive for the virus. It was the biggest count ever reported from a market area in Kozhikode district. Following the unexpected test results, over 700 persons had been asked to undergo antigen test in view of public safety.

Meanwhile, some traders were of the view that the risk factor was still there owing to the unscientific measures adopted to control crowd. They claimed that surveillance by a few policemen and QRT members would not be enough to cover such a wide area with multiple entry and exit points.

“For a well-organised mall or shopping centre, the crowd control measures proposed by the district administration will work. Here, more planning is needed,” said Prasannakumar, a vegetable vendor. He added that the risk of disease spread still existed at the market in the absence of thorough screening and uncontrolled entry of people.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/b8lt5m/article32797817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvkzpalayam1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/50-of-sellers-resume-business-at-palayam-market/article32797818.ece
292,2020/10/07,BOND proves a hit in Kozhikode,"With the latest service between Vadakara and Kalpetta, it benefits over 200 passengers.

The Bus on Demand (BOND) service launched by the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to offer pre-booked daily service to commuters on select routes is proving a success in Kozhikode district.

With the launch of the latest service between Vadakara and Kalpetta on Wednesday, there are now five exclusive BOND services, benefiting over 200 regular passengers.

The services are available between Thottilpalam and Civil Station, Thalassery and Calicut University, Thamarassery and Kozhikode Corporation, and Thiruvambady and Kozhikode city. Considering the warm response, four more routes between Koorachundu and Kozhikode, Balussery and Baby Memorial Hospital, Thamarassery and Calicut University, and Thamarassery and Iqra Hospital have been identified for the service.

Project coordinators said BOND services were now being explored mostly by working professionals who had earlier been depending on private vehicles or local buses. As the entry is exclusively reserved for travel card holders, the services offer a premium feel to commuters thanks to strict timings, convenient boarding options, assured seats, and non-stop travel, they added.

The routes have been fixed in such a way to benefit maximum number of commuters. Exclusive helplines have been launched to answer their queries and grievances. The trips are offered by maintaining the COVID-19 protocol. Since commuters with reserved seats do not have a chance to mingle with other travellers, they also enjoy a safe journey.

Travel cards for just five days or a month are now available at the KSRTC’s reservation desk. Though it is a premium service, officials have made it clear that they charge only reasonable fare based on the distance. Efforts are also on to add more features to the BOND service considering its popularity.

For the KSRTC, one of the biggest advantages of the service is that it can get funds in advance and use them for effective planning of trips. It is a mutually rewarding experience, as commuters can enjoy uninterrupted journey in time even during the peak hours, assured seating arrangements, and convenient pick-and-drop service.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/axatx0/article32797573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvkzksrtc,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/bond-proves-a-hit-in-kozhikode/article32797574.ece

Active COVID-19 cases in Kozhikode district reached 10,957 on Wednesday when 1,576 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This is the highest single-day spike so far.

Health officials pointed out that 9,951 samples had been tested in the last 24 hours, and that the results of 9,776 were made available on Wednesday. The test positivity ratio, which determines the prevalence of the infection among the tested population, remains high at 15.04%. It is thrice the standard of 5% set by the World Health Organisation. However, the accumulative test positivity rate so far has been 6.35%.

According to the District Medical Officer, 1,471 people got infected through local transmission. The source of infection in 88 persons was unknown. As many as 327 people from within the Kozhikode Corporation acquired the infection through local contact. A total of 5,872 people are in home isolation. There are 35 health workers among the newly infected persons.

Three deaths were reported from the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. They include a 70-year-old woman from Kodoor, an 87-year-old man from Muthuvallur, and a 50-year-old man from Palengad, all in Malappuram district, said a bulletin.

Meanwhile, Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran called for compliance with restrictions in the wake of the severity of cases in the district. Pointing out that large gatherings at public places were the main reason for the current situation, he said none should venture out unless for emergency needs. Otherwise, it will not only affect them, but also those sick people and senior citizens at their homes.

All frontline workers, including health workers and police personnel, are now getting infected. If people do not abide by rules, restrictions will be made more stringent, he said in a release.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/edy7je/article32796689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvkzmavroorroad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/active-covid-19-cases-cross-10000-mark-in-kozhikode/article32796690.ece
294,2020/10/07,Will CPI(M) re-think strategy of wooing IUML dissidents?,"Cadres view experiment as turning into a liability for party

The experiment of the CPI(M) to strengthen its relations with the Muslim community by wooing disgruntled elements of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) from time to time is viewed in the party circles as a liability for the Left Democratic Front (LDF) after the gold smuggling case hanging over the heads of some leaders.

The gold smuggling case, according to CPI(M) sources, has set off debates within the party circles about the party continuing the experiment. The latest trigger for the debate is Karat Faisal, an LDF-backed councillor of Koduvally municipality, being taken into custody by the Customs Commissionerate (Preventive) in Kochi last week in connection with the gold smuggling case. The sleuths also raided and seized documents from a private hospital of which he is the executive director. Incidentally, P.T.A. Rahim, another CPI(M)-backed legislator, representing Kunnamangalam segment, is the chairman of the hospital.

Already, a section of the CPI(M) cadres in north Kerala has covertly expressed reservations about the party continuing this experiment in the wake of the interrogation of the Minister of Higher Education, K.T. Jaleel, by the premier anti-terror agency, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), a week after he was questioned by another Central agency, the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

Lok Sabha polls

The party leadership has been wobbling around this experiment even after the LDF’s dismal performance in the Lok Sabha polls last year. The induction of the Indian National League into the LDF and the subsequent merger of the National Secular Conference (NSC) of Mr. Rahim failed to impact the community arithmetic in its favour unlike the previous Assembly polls.

Incidentally, the merger of the NSC with INL was done with the approval of the CPI(M). Mr. Rahim, a former district secretary of the IUML, had left the party almost a decade ago and won from Koduvally and Kunnamangalam Assembly segments in the 2006 and 2011 polls. Mr. Rahim was in the news when his son and son- in-law were among the 19 Keralites arrested in Saudi Arabia two years ago.

Karat Razak, legislator of Koduvally, was the IUML’s general secretary of the Koduvally mandalam before he won with the support of the LDF in the 2016 Assembly elections.

Last year, although the Supreme Court had stayed a Kerala High Court verdict disqualifying Mr. Razak, the apex court had restrained him from taking part in voting in the Assembly and he would not receive any emoluments as an MLA.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/will-cpim-re-think-strategy-of-wooing-iuml-dissidents/article32787093.ece

298,2020/10/07,Madurai Corporation yet to set up smart city advisory forum: MP,"‘Elected representatives are not being involved in project implementation’

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan on Wednesday expressed anguish over Madurai Corporation’s failure to constitute the Smart City Advisory Forum (SCAF) comprising elected representatives as per Smart City Mission Guidelines.

“The local body has taken up several important works to make one of the oldest cities a smart city with additional facilities at a massive cost of ₹2,000 crore. But a few officials have been taking the calls on project design to execution without following the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs guidelines on the mission,” Mr. Venkatesan told The Hindu.

He wondered why the local body chose not to involve the elected representatives such as the MP and MLAs in the projects.

“In the absence of the corporation council, as the urban local body election could not be conducted, the presence of SCAF and convening of periodical meetings with elected representatives would have helped in better planning and execution of the projects,” he pointed out.

Under the guidelines, Madurai Collector would have been the Chairman of SCAF with the MP as Co-Chairman. The six MLAs, whose constituencies were in the city limits, and the Corporation Commissioner and City Engineer would have been members.

When the DISHA meeting, chaired by Madurai MP, was convened on September 7 to discuss the smart city projects under implementation, Corporation officials feigned ignorance about the need to constitute SCAF. “Both the Commissioner and City Engineer said they were unaware of this aspect,” Mr. Venkatesan said.

However, subsequently, he accessed through MoHUA the reminder letter sent to State governments and Chief Executive Officer of all smart cities to convene SCAF meetings.

Reminder letter

The letter, dated December 26, 2019, sought compliance report on the SCAF meeting. The reminder was a direct fallout of a number of MPs of the Parliamentary Standing Committee for MoHUA complaining that the SCAF meetings were not conducted by many smart cities.

“The Ministry had asked the smart cities to convene at least one meeting by January 15. But officials of Madurai Corporation have conveniently given it a miss,” he said.

In his response, Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan said the city held time-to-time consultation with stakeholders on plan and progress of projects.

“We will shortly convene the SCAF meeting that could not be conducted due to COVID-19 pandemic,” the civic body chief added.

Complaining about lack of transparency in the detailed project report on implementation of proposals, Mr. Venkatesan said though 45% of local residents gave priority to improvement in city traffic and transport facilities, the authorities chose different projects.

“The decision to increase the number of shops and space for vehicle parking at Periyar bus stand by three-fold without enhancing traffic facilities is only going to make the city more congested. There is nothing smart about it,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cov1sm/article32797516.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA08-SUVENKATESAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai-corporation-yet-to-set-up-smart-city-advisory-forum-mp/article32797517.ece

With the experience gained in treating COVID-19 patients and a well-equipped intensive respiratory care unit, doctors at Kanniyakumari Government Medical College Hospital at Asaripallam here have saved the life of a 76-year-old woman who was taking treatment for 53 days.

When the woman from Muttom, a coastal hamlet, was brought to the hospital, investigations conducted on her showed that she had 95% lung involvement. Though her relatives lost hope that she would recover from the viral infection, the doctors took it as a challenge and started the treatment.

304,2020/10/07,Training for police personnel on CD file writing,"Finer case details in the document will lead to conviction of accused: SP

Madurai District Police have embarked on a programme to train police personnel on the nuances of case dairy (CD) file writing, an important document in taking cases to their logical conclusion.

Three police personnel identified in each police station will undergo five-day training.

“CD file writing assumes lot of significance when it comes to fetching conviction to the accused in cases. Often inadvertent mistakes in entering finer details of a criminal case result in acquittal of the accused,” Superintendent of Police Sujit Kumar, said after inaugurating the training programme on Wednesday.

Though the cases are investigated by officials in the rank of sub-inspector and above, the role of CD file writing police personnel is significant. “They need to take a lot of caution in making entries to ensure that not even minor case details are missed,” he pointed out.

Officials have roped in resource persons who will provide them case details where mistakes in CD file writing led to acquittal.

“This will help the police personnel understand the gravity of CD file writing. Besides classroom teaching, the trainees will be given practical tests on writing CD files,” the SP added.

Even as a team of experts from IIT-Madras is involved in investigating the ‘strain’ on structural member of Pamban rail bridge, Southern Railway has short-terminated Chennai-Rameswaram special train at Mandapam as a precautionary measure.

“Since the continuous health monitoring system revealed a major strain on the member of the bridge, we are not allowing any passenger trains on it,” a senior railway official said.

The sensors installed on the century-old steel bridge by IIT-Madras raised an alarm after the first train — on resumption of train services after lockdown — crossed the bridge on Friday. Consequently, the empty rake of the train was run on the structure from Rameswaram to Mandapam. Passengers were ferried through special bus services to Mandapam.

“The inspection is under way and the actual problem is being ascertained. Only after trials and ensuring the stability of the bridge, we will advise on running of trains on the bridge,” the official added.

306,2020/10/07,Police to visit petitioner’s place,"Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar has instructed his subordinates including the Deputy Superintendents of Police to visit the petitioner’s place, instead of asking them to come to the police station for questioning, so that the Investigating Officer can better understand the nature of complaint and take appropriate and immediate action.

In the 56 police stations across the district, the aggrieved public used to submit around 80 petitions every day seeking redressal for their grievances, mostly land disputes or conflicts over using the ommon path. In the normal procedure, the petitioner and the opponent would be asked to come to the police station at a particular time for inquiry by the Inspector or Sub-Inspector of Police concerned. In most of the cases, the petitioners and the opponents would come to the police station along with their advocates.

A.C. Arun, consultant gastroenterologist at the hospital, said the patient approached the hospital as she was suffering from jaundice and abdominal pain. After evaluation, it was found that a stone was formed in the patient's bile duct, which was the reason for her jaundice. It was also found that the patient was COVID-19 positive.

“So, we performed an advanced endoscopy procedure to place a stent inside her pile duct and she recovered from jaundice. The procedure was successfully performed even when the patient was COVID-19 positive,” said Dr. Arun.

308,2020/10/07,Hoteliers urged to serve hygienically-prepared food,"Owners of eateries – right from leading restaurants to roadside eateries – should serve quality food prepared in a hygienic manner with quality ingredients to the customers, Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish has said.

Formally inaugurating the ‘Eat Right Challenge’ programme here on Wednesday, Ms. Shilpa said a balanced diet, the firm foundation for leading a disease-free living, should be ensured to every customer. Though the hoteliers were aware that cooking oil being used repeatedly for preparing food would cause health issues to the consumers, a section of them, with profit as the only motive, was serving substandard food prepared with oil already used for frying food.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India recently launched the ‘Eat Right Challenge’ competition in 197 districts and 150 cities across the country to create awareness among consumers of food safety. The objective is to improve public health through right choice of food to fight lifestyle diseases.

As more than 60% of the deaths in the country are attributed to lifestyle-related non-communicable diseases, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched this programme.

The Collector also inaugurated a special training programme for roadside eatery owners on preparing and serving quality food and gave them uniforms sponsored by a private firm.

Since a special camp for registration of roadside eateries and issue of licence was organised as part of this event, Ms. Shilpa handed over permits to two applicants.

309,2020/10/07,‘Government trying to bury facts behind UP-murder’,"Condemning the alleged rape and murder of a 19-year-old dalit girl in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras, members of Aathi Thamizhar Peravai staged a demonstration in front of the Collectorate on Wednesday.

Addressing the protestors, Padma Kalaikannan, deputy secretary of the forum’s Tirunelveli district women’s wing, said that when the entire nation had been rocked by the gruesome rape and murder of the girl, the government was working overtime to bury the facts behind this heinous crime, besides coercing and barring politicians and the journalists from meeting the family members of the victim.

The pre-planned attack unleashed by the police on Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi when they were on their way to meet the family could be neither forgotten nor pardoned. “The circumstances that led to the commission of the crime and the ongoing developments associated with the rape and murder of the girl clearly show that there is no safety for anyone from the oppressed communities, especially for women, in the country.

The police officers who manhandled Mr. Gandhi and misbehaved with Ms. Priyanka should be removed from service while handing over the investigation of the case to the CBI. The cases foisted against those who were protesting against the rape and murder of the girl should be withdrawn unconditionally, said the protestors who offered bangles to one of the protestors wearing the mask of Yogi Adityanath.

National Women’s Front members also staged a demonstration at Melapalayam condemning the rape and murder. Led by its district president N. Jannathul Firdous, they raised slogans against Mr. Yogi Adityanath and the highhandedness of the police against political leaders and the media who were working to bring to light the truth.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/government-trying-to-bury-facts-behind-up-murder/article32794991.ece
310,2020/10/07,Pothole-ridden railway underbridge poses serious threat to motorists,"Motorists feel blindfolded once they enter the underbridge which lacks natural lighting even during daytime

Vehicle drivers cruising smoothly on National Highway 75 at Padil will suddenly feel blindfolded even as the vehicle totters no sooner they enter the railway underbridge at Padil on the outskirts of the city.

For, the flyover commissioned after an abnormal delay in April 2017 has been in a lower elevation thereby preventing flow of natural light during the daytime and the road surface has got completely damaged following constant water-logging.

Built through box-pushing technology, the underbridge has been mired with flaws every since its commissioning. As the surface of the underbridge is below the road surface from both the ends, rainwater always gets accumulated inside and motorists have a tough time particularly during the rainy season.

The underbridge is part of the National Highways Authority of India’s Mangaluru Port Connectivity Project between BC Road and Nanthoor.

Ramachandra Nayak, who regularly uses the underbridge, said that the NHAI appeared to have made no attempt to address the water-logging issue inside the underpass. Consequently, the underpass is filled with potholes and craters thereby giving shivers to vehicle drivers, he said.

There are no lights either inside the underpass which remains pitch dark even during daytime because of its lower position, rued Harniish Raj, an entrepreneur having his office at Kannur. Lack of lighting makes drivers blind when they enter the underpass after a smooth drive from Padil Junction, he said.

Rohan Kumar, a two-wheeler rider, said that it would be a test every time he passed through the underbridge as there was every chance of a heavy vehicle hitting him if he applied brakes to avoid craters. Those new to the stretch would have no idea of the road condition and often their vehicles get damaged, he said.

The underpass on carriageway of National Highway 75, which was commissioned recently, has no such issues as the carriageway is on the road level on both the sides.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/gtnge3/article32799748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08MNPADILRAILWAYUNDERBRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/pothole-ridden-railway-underbridge-poses-serious-threat-to-motorists/article32795744.ece
311,2020/10/07,Udupi temples asked to take preventive steps,"A large number of people are expected to visit them during Navarathri, Deepavali

Udupi Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha on Wednesday directed officials managing temples in the district to take all precautionary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during the upcoming festival season.

Chairing a meeting of administrators and other officers of temples in Udupi, Mr. Jagadeesha said that a large number of people were expected to visit temples during the Navarathri, Deepavali and other festivals in the coming days. Temple managements should ensure that COVID-19 guidelines were strictly followed while allowing people to participate in sevas and festivities.

Temple administrations should mark boxes at every 6 ft distance, provide hand washing/ sanitiser facility and ensure that visitors wear masks. They may take the help of the police to regulate crowd, if more people are visiting temples. While fairs, Brahmotsavas, Pavithrotsavas, etc., were temporarily banned, temples that could not stop these rituals may hold them inside the premises with the participation of only the required staff, he said.

Meanwhile, managements should thoroughly sanitise temple premises and surrounding areas every time after any programme, during the night and the day. They also should display publicity material on COVID-19 awareness and make public announcements at repeated intervals. Temples that were already conducting Anna Santarpane (mass feeding) may continue to do it by adhering to the guidelines, though starting such a programme afresh was not encouraged, Mr. Jagadeesha said.

Temple managements should also ensure owners and staff of shops and establishments around the temples wear face masks and ensure social distancing. Assistant Commissioners, Tahsildars and police officers should visit temples in their jurisdiction at regular intervals to ensure that guidelines are being followed.

Additional Deputy Commissioner B. Sadashiva Prabhu, Muzrai Tahsildar Sudhakar and others were present.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/udupi-temples-asked-to-take-preventive-steps/article32795665.ece
312,2020/10/07,KIOCL achieves highest export turnover in 2019-20,"The company plans to spend about ₹ 3,553 crore towards expansion and diversification

KIOCL Ltd., a public sector undertaking under the Union Ministry of Steel, exported 1.99 million tonnes of pellets worth ₹1,574.13 crore, highest since the closure of its Kudremukh captive mine (2005) during 2019-20.

Total exports stood at 84%, up by 31% year-on-year basis, penetrating into Brazil, Middle East, China, European markets etc., thereby improving overall performance of the company all through complete utilisation of sea route, said a release here.

Stating this at KIOCL’s 44th annual general meeting held at Bengaluru recently through video-conferencing, Company Chairman and MD M.V. Subba Rao noted insights by the company made it stronger thereby producing better results despite COVID-19.

During the year, the pellet production was 2.375 million tonnes, up by 6% YoY, pellet dispatch was 2.356 million tonnes, up by 7% YoY, revenue from operations was ₹2,056.53 crore, up by 2% YoY and profit after tax was ₹43.48 crore, he said while declaring a dividend of ₹0.7 per equity share.

Capacity expansion

Stating that the company was passing through an important phase, Mr. Rao noted major projects were under way to diversify the activities from a mere single product company whose plant was away from both mine and consumer head. In this direction, about ₹3,553 crore are being spent on expansion and diversification projects.

Setting up of a 5 MW captive solar power plant in Karnataka, modernisation of Pellet Plant Unit by installing Vertical Pressure Filters and Reclaimers to handle iron ore fines, undertaking mineral ore exploration works as an exploration entity for State and Union governments setting up of 1.8 lakh tonnes per annum Coke Oven Plant and 2 LPTA Ductile Iron Spun Pipe Plant and 2 MPTA pellet plant as a joint venture with Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd., Vaizag, were under different stages of implementation as part of diversification and expansion, Mr. Rao said.

Mr. Khader told reporters here that the district in-charge Minister had said that COVID-19 positive patients would be treated for free at all private hospitals under Ayushman Bharath. However, confusion still prevails with regard to treatment and billing, he said.

The district nodal officer handling the scheme was suddenly removed and a medical doctor was proposed to be appointed to that role. It was not proper to appoint a doctor who has to treat patients as a nodal officer, Mr. Khader said, urging the government to appoint a non-medical doctor to discharge the responsibility.

Former Minister K. Abhayachandra Jain said the government was not responding to the strike by contractual health support staff. Many people have told him that it was difficult to get treatment in private hospitals under the Ayushman scheme, he said adding Mr. Khader had rejuvenated the healthcare system when heading the health and family welfare department.

Mr. Jain said it was essential that the Health Minister, Ministers and legislators work in unison to fight COVID-19.

317,2020/10/07,"At 41 million real-time transactions a day, India leads the world: Report","According to the report released on Wednesday, six other countries also saw more than doubling of their real-time payment transactions year-over-year

Thanks to the pandemic, the country has become the global leader in real-time financial transactions with 41 million transactions per day, which is more than double that of the last year, says an international report.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen India doubling its every day real-time transactions at 41 million, says the latest report from FIS, which is a leading provider of technology solutions for merchants, banks and capital markets firms globally.

According to the report released on Wednesday, six other countries also saw more than doubling of their real-time payment transactions year-over-year, while four saw at least a twofold increase in transaction value.

But in terms of the growth rate, the list is topped by Bahrain with 657% growth, followed by Ghana clipping at 488%, the Philippines growing at 309% , Australia at 214% , and Poland at 208%.

India’s growth was 213%, handling 41 million transactions a day, according to the report.

India leads global real-time payments, processing 41 million real-time transactions per day, more than any other country in the world, says the report, adding the country continues to innovate with the launch of extensive business services on the real-time rails including IPO subscriptions, mandate management and invoice-in-the-box.

South Korea reported the highest number of real-time transactions per capita, with 75 transactions annually processed. In the U.S., over 130 financial institutions are currently implementing real-time payments, a five-fold increase since September 2019.

Over half (56%) of all European payments service providers have joined the pan-European Sepa Credit Transfer Instant Payments Network, which brings cross-border and instant payments to 20 countries.

Vietnam and Hungary added real-time payments networks since last year, bringing the total number of countries with such schemes to 56.

According to FIS, the request to pay (R2P), cross-border payments, and corporate treasury business-to-business payments are driving adoption of real-time payments networks globally. R2P systems offer a convenient and flexible way for people, businesses and governments to request a payment from a third-party.

FIS supports real-time payments across the globe, processing instant transactions in 24 countries including Australia, Britain, China, India, and the U.S.

318,2020/10/07,Govt recognises need for further stimulus at an appropriate time: Sanyal,"Addressing the 115th AGM of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he said there was space on the monetary and fiscal side to implement further stimulus

Principal Economic Adviser Sanjeev Sanyal on Wednesday said the government recognises the need for further stimulus at an appropriate time to perk up demand in the economy, hit by COVID-19.

Addressing the 115th AGM of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he said there was space on the monetary and fiscal side to implement further stimulus.

With the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the government announced ₹1.70 lakh crore Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, followed by the unveiling of ₹20.97 lakh crore Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package, which many analysts said fell short of addressing demand concern.

“However, we recognise that there is a need for providing further stimulus to the economy at some point in time as may be appropriate,” he said.

This is not something that is new, he said, adding that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently mentioned this.

Addressing the anxiety over low demand in the economy, Mr. Sanyal said unlike many countries which may have gone from very large upfront demand creation, the approach of India was basically focused on creating a safety net, both for the vulnerable sections of society and business sector given the fiscal constraints.

“If we tried to re-inflate consumption demand in April, May, June it would have been entirely a waste of resources for the simple reason we ourselves have locked down all the avenues for spending,” he said.

With unlock taking place, he said, the manufacturing sector is gradually getting back to the pre-COVID levels and the services sector will gather momentum.

“So as we open things up, clearly, we are in a better position to do so (announce further a stimulus package). In this context, let me say there is space both on the monetary side and on the fiscal side to do this, and a willingness to use this,” he said.

Echoing similar views, K.V. Kamath - former president New Development Bank - said there is space on both monetary and fiscal sides for another package.

Mr. Kamath also said India has unending space and the opportunity to grow at double-digit for the next 25 years.

Besides, strong foreign currency flows, low-interest rate and ample liquidity, he said, top 50 companies in India are almost totally unleveraged and have the capacity to make fresh investment.

About the fear of double-digit contraction, Morgan Stanley India managing director Ridham Desai said: “Our forecast is minus 4.7% for this year. We think that the economy is coming back and coming back very quickly.”

Mr. Desai projected that India’s manufacturing sector could triple in the next 10 years as the world is entering into multi-polar from bi-polar earlier.

“When we talk to large manufacturing companies, a lot of them are eager to come to India to set up manufacturing. These companies were never worried about demand in India, and therefore you can see that India has had a very steady flow of FDI,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/738g8l/article30705408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01SANJEEVSANYAL1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/govt-recognises-need-for-further-stimulus-at-an-appropriate-time-sanyal/article32793802.ece
319,2020/10/07,IMF chief says global economy less dire but long climb ahead,"Fund will make a ‘small’ upward revision to its earlier forecast, says Georgieva

The global economy is looking ‘less dire’ than it did in June and the International Monetary Fund will make a ‘small’ upward revision to its 2020 global output forecast, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Tuesday.

“My key message is this: The global economy is coming back from the depths of this crisis,” Ms. Georgieva said in remarks to a London School of Economics event. “But this calamity is far from over. All countries are now facing what I would call ‘the long ascent’ — a difficult climb that will be long, uneven, and uncertain. And prone to setbacks,” she added. The IMF had in June forecast that the coronavirus shutdowns would shrink global GDP by 4.9%, marking the sharpest contraction since the 1930s Great Depression, and called for more policy support. The IMF will publish its revised forecasts next week.

But $12 trillion in fiscal support, coupled with unprecedented monetary easing has allowed many advanced economies, including the United States and the euro zone, to escape the worst damage and start to recover, she said.

‘China recovery faster’

China also has recovered faster than expected.

Emerging markets and low income countries face a precarious situation with weak health systems, high external debt and dependency on sectors most exposed to the pandemic such as tourism and commodities as well as high external debt, she said. “In low-income countries, the shocks are so profound that we face the risk of a lost generation.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ppdxt8/article32786555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07BUINTERNATIONALMONETARYFUND,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/imf-chief-says-global-economy-less-dire-but-long-climb-ahead/article32786556.ece

India’s largest software services firm Tata Consultancy Services on October 7 reported 4.9% rise in consolidated net profit to ₹8,433 crore for the September 2020 quarter, and announced up to ₹16,000 buyback plan.

The net profit excluded ₹1,218 crore-provision towards legal claim. Including this number, the net profit was at ₹7,475 crore, TCS said in a regulatory filing.

TCS had registered a net profit of ₹8,042 crore in the September 2019 quarter.

321,2020/10/07,"Govt. allows Reliance, others to sell gas to affiliates; marketing freedom to benefit Cairn, Focus","The government between 2016 and 2019 gave pricing freedom for all fields except those given to State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) on a nomination basis.

In a major boost to firms such as Reliance Industries, the government on Wednesday allowed affiliate companies to buy gas produced from non-regulated fields as part of giving complete marketing freedom.

The government between 2016 and 2019 gave pricing freedom for all fields except those given to State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) on a nomination basis.

But, there were restrictions on marketing including a ban on affiliates of producers buying the fuel and in some cases, a state nominee being mandated to offtake the gas. This restricted competition kept prices artificially low.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved natural gas marketing reforms, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters.

There will be no change in the price of gas sold by ONGC and OIL from fields given to them on a nomination basis. The rate at $1.79 per million British thermal unit is half of the production cost.

He said the CCEA approved a standard procedure for discovering the price of gas through a transparent and competitive e-bidding as also “permitting affiliates to participate in the bidding process for the sale of gas”.

Complete marketing freedom has been provided where production sharing contracts (PSCs) already provide for pricing freedom. This would benefit firms such as Vedanta-owned Cairn and Focus Energy who can now sell fuel to anyone and not necessarily to state-owned GAIL.

“This will add 40 million standard cubic metres per day of production from Krishna-Godavari basin and other areas to the current output of 84 mmscmd,” Mr. Pradhan said.

He said the ban on producers buying their own gas will continue to prevent manipulations.

But, their affiliates can participate in the auction for the discovery of price and buying the gas, he said.

Last year, Reliance and its partner BP had bid out 5 mmscmd of new gas from their KG-D6 block to firms such as Essar and GSPC.

Reliance and BP were keen to buy the gas but rules did not allow. Now, India Gas Solutions Pvt Ltd, an equal joint venture of Reliance and BP, will be allowed to bid and buy the gas.

“The objective of the policy is to prescribe a standard procedure to discover the market price of gas to be sold in the market by gas producers, through a transparent and competitive process,” he said.

He added that it permits affiliates to participate in the bidding process for the sale of gas and allows marketing freedom to certain field development plans (FDPs) where PSCs already provide pricing freedom.

Mr. Pradhan said the policy aims to provide a standard procedure for the sale of natural gas in a transparent and competitive manner to discover market price by issuing guidelines for sale by the contractor through e-bidding.

“This will bring uniformity in the bidding process across the various contractual regimes and policies to avoid ambiguity and contribute towards ease of doing business,” he said.

He, however, said re-bidding will be done in case only the affiliates participate in the auction.

“These reforms will build on a series of transformative reforms rolled out by the government in the past several years,” he said.

The industry association added that this will also “endanger U.S. jobs, put U.S. interests at risk, slowing down R&D into solutions to the COVID crisis,” while reiterate that it is important for the US market to be able to access skilled talent for its businesses, especially during the COVID-19 recovery phase.

The new rules notified by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Labor (DoL) for the H-1B visa regime, changes the definitions of specialty occupation, employer, & employee-employer relationship, and limits the validity of an H-1B visa to one year for a worker placed at a third-party worksite, while also increasing enforcement and investigations for these visas.

“The new rules also changes the current four-tiered prevailing wage system for jobs that U.S. employers seek to fill with foreign workers. Both rules will be issued as Interim Final Rules (IFRs), without any notice period or right to comment,” Nasscom noted.

It added that these regulations seem to be based on misinformation about the programme and runs counter-productive to their very objective of saving the American economy and jobs. “This is particularly relevant at a time when U.S. businesses continue to face a huge deficit of STEM skills: overall U.S. unemployment rate grew from 4.1% in Jan-2020 to 8.4% in August-2020; while unemployment in computer occupations declined from 3% to 2.5% in this period.”

In the 30-day period ending September 28, 2020, there were over 652,000 active job vacancy postings advertised online for jobs in computer occupations, up from 625,000 vacancies in the 30-day period ending May 13, 2020. “That is, despite the high degree of overall unemployment in the US, demand for high-tech skills continues to remain robust – clearly endorsing the argument that there are just not enough workers with relevant skills to fill them. The new rules announced will worsen this talent gap by making it more difficult for U.S. employers to hire foreign workers,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/new-h-1b-rules-to-restrict-uss-access-to-skilled-talent-nasscom/article32790314.ece
323,2020/10/07,‘Tough time for banks as stressed loans set to rise’,"Quick recovery key to limit losses: Fitch

Fitch Ratings on Tuesday said Indian banks face a tough operating environment in the near term as stressed loans and write-offs increase due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Indian banks face a tough operating environment in the near term, as stressed loans and write-offs increase as a result of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, but a swift economic recovery will be critical to limiting loan losses in what is likely to be a protracted period of weakness in the asset-quality cycle,” Fitch Ratings said.

Banks have been permitted by the Reserve Bank of India to undertake a one-time restructuring exercise of loans affected by the pandemic, which will provide relief in terms of bad loan recognition and provisioning, Fitch said.

“However, the exercise could leave the sector saddled with a high bad loan burden over the next few years if restructured loans do not perform according to agreed milestones,” it added. Fitch said the central bank’s data showed that Indian banks wrote off almost $85 billion over FY14-FY19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/s2lrje/article32786519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07BUEMPTYSHOP,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tough-time-for-banks-as-stressed-loans-set-to-rise/article32786520.ece

Torrent Gas Ltd. on Tuesday said it will invest ₹8,000 crore over the next five years in expanding its city gas operations with a target to set up 500 CNG dispensing pumps by March 2023.

Torrent Gas, the city gas distribution (CGD) arm of Gujarat-based $3-billion Torrent Group, holds a city gas licence for selling compressed natural gas (CNG) to vehicles and piped cooking gas (PNG) to industries and households kitchens in 32 districts across seven States.

Within 18 months of its operations, Torrent Gas has set up 100 CNG pumps, its director Jinal Mehta said at a virtual event organised to announce the commissioning of 42 CNG stations.

“Torrent Gas intends to make a total investment of ₹8,000 crore ($1.1 billion) over the next five years towards the creation of CGD infrastructure in the country, of which ₹1,050 crore has already been invested,” Mr. Mehta said.

Despite the constraints presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, Torrent Gas has been able to set up 100 CNG stations within a relatively short span of time.

“We are now working towards our near-term goal of setting up 200 CNG stations by March 2021 and medium-term goal of setting up 500 CNG stations by March 2023, apart from making PNG widely available to industries and residences.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/torrent-gas-to-invest-8000-cr-in-distribution/article32786466.ece
326,2020/10/07,Rupee recovers by 13 paise; ends 2-day losing streak,"Snapping its two-day losing streak, the rupee strengthened by 13 paise to settle at 73.33 against the U.S. dollar on October 7, aided by foreign fund inflows and positive domestic equities.

At the interbank forex market, the domestic unit opened at 73.53 against the U.S. dollar, and moved in a range of 73.29 and 73.55.

It finally finished at 73.33, registering a rise of 13 paise over its last close of 73.46 against the greenback.

Traders said investors are focusing on the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. The newly-constituted MPC of the Reserve Bank began its three-day deliberations on Wednesday. The decision of the rate-setting panel will be announced on October 9.

“This week is the RBI MPC outcome, we expect the central bank to maintain a status quo on the back of rising inflation. The focus will be on growth projections, as since February 2020, the RBI has not given a solid economic projection,” said Rahul Gupta, Head of Research-Currency, Emkay Global Financial Services.

Mr. Gupta added, “We are observing an occasional bullish attempt in the dollar. And as the dollar index marches towards 94 zone, there is an uptrend in USD-INR. Also, there still persists an uncertainty in the run-up to U.S. presidential elections and this cautiousness will keep dollar bulls active.”

Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, inched up 0.03% to 93.71.

On the domestic equity market front, the 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex rose 304.38 points or 0.77% to close at 39,878.95.

Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty jumped 76.45 points or 0.66% to finish at 11,738.85.

Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in the capital markets, picking up shares worth ₹1,101.76 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional exchange data.

Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 1.27% to $42.11 per barrel.

Gaurang Somaiya, Forex and Bullion Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said, “Rupee consolidated in a narrow range but gained marginally following a surge in domestic equities. Yesterday, the greenback rose against its major crosses in the latter half of the session after U.S. President Trump called off negotiations with Democratic lawmakers on coronavirus relief legislation until after the election.”

“In the next couple of sessions we expect volatility to drop ahead of the important RBI policy statement that will be released later this Friday. We expect USD-INR [Spot] to quote in the range of 73.20 and 73.80,” he added.

Sriram Iyer, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities, said the currency started the day on a weak note after the U.S. dollar rebounded on October 7 morning after Mr. Trump called off stimulus negotiations.

“So risk appetite waned as uncertainty in the markets could continue until the November 3 election which helped the safe haven U.S. dollar,” he said.

However, after briefly trading weaker, the currency was aided by speculative dollar sales on bets that investment flows will pick up in the coming sessions, he added.

“Indian rupee gained after two consecutive daily losses on foreign fund inflows in Reliance subsidiaries and buoyant domestic equities indices,” said Devarsh Vakil, Deputy Head Retail Research, HDFC Securities.

The Sensex has now gained 1,905.73 points in five sessions, while the Nifty has advanced 516.45 points.

Titan was the top gainer in the Sensex pack on October 7, climbing 4.44%, after the Tata group firm said its business has been returning to normalcy in the second quarter of this fiscal, led by the jewellery division.

Index heavyweight Reliance Industries spurted 2.13% a day after its retail arm raised ₹5,512.50 crore from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) for a 1.20% stake.

Bajaj Auto, Maruti, UltraTech Cement, and ONGC were among the other prominent gainers.

IT major TCS inched up 0.78% ahead of its quarterly results.

On the other hand, Bajaj Finance, PowerGrid, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, NTPC and Bajaj Finserv were among the laggards, skidding up to 4.12%.

On the global front, Wall Street tumbled after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was calling off negotiations with Democratic lawmakers for a fresh stimulus package until after the elections next month.

However, Asian and European markets showed a mixed trend.

“Markets remained upbeat amid signs of stabilisation in India’s services sector and optimism over earnings. Business updates have been strong for companies like HDFC, HDFC Bank, Titan.

329,2020/10/07,A wake-up call for the Republic,"Only the court can withstand aberrations that make the citizen lose faith in the functioning of the state

No social contract can eliminate crime in society. History has shown constant hostility between criminals who disturb the social order and those who endeavour to maintain it. Laws dealing with crimes and criminals emanate from power structures, in one form or another, charged with the responsibility of maintaining the social order which allows individuals to go about their everyday lives in the belief that they enjoy the protective cover of those wielding authority. No modern society should tolerate individual rights to be trampled upon and individual liberties to be sacrificed by the state and its machinery collaborating with or aiding those charged with offences that disturb societal peace and tranquility.

Of late, our Republic has witnessed crimes, the sheer barbarity of which has shocked our collective conscience. Perpetrators of such heinous crimes have been emboldened by the manner in which the state investigating machinery has been dealing with them in the recent past.

The colours of violence

Since 2014, caste-based criminal targeting has increased exponentially. Dalits are often victims of upper-caste brutality. The iniquitous caste structure accompanied by unforgiving mindsets allows such crimes to be committed with impunity. The perpetrators believe that the state machinery will come to their aid because of caste affiliations embedded in the power structure. This explains the public lynching of Dalits and the forgotten episodes of their victimisation including sexual assault, with perpetrators going unpunished. Caste and poverty go hand in hand. Those at the bottom of the caste structure are also immersed in poverty. They lack the wherewithal to get justice.

Then there are crimes based on religious predilections. Minorities within a majoritarian state need the protective measure of the state because the prevalent majoritarian culture seeks dominance which often expresses itself in violent retributions. Innocent victims are attacked for not following majoritarian diktats. They are targeted for what they wear and for their physical attributes. They are publicly shamed and made to pay for the perceived sins of their ancestors. The perpetrator is perceived to represent majoritarian nationalist sentiment.

The third aspect is the foisting of an ideology on those who either don’t subscribe to it or are openly opposed to it. Here, the politics of violence takes over. The political class, in suppressing the voice of dissent, seeks to use violence as a weapon to instil fear so that the message of conformity percolates downstream to quell all forms of opposition. The Indian state, therefore, has to confront violence which has cultural, religious and political colour.

State of the legal system

For the rule of law to prevail, the legal system must equip itself to meet the expectations of the law. It must investigate fairly, remain unbiased, and punish the guilty. But the legal system seems to have distanced itself from the law by doing the bidding of dominant affiliations. Recent tragedies fuel doubts about the nature of the state and the role of investigating agencies. How then does one explain a crime recognised by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court to have been committed in public gaze culminating in the court unable to identify both the conspiracy and the conspirators? How does one explain the conduct of an investigating agency which cremates a 19-year-old victim in secrecy at 2:30 in the morning without informing the family? How do we come to terms with the opinion of that agency that the victim was not raped despite the family referring to the condition of the girl and later her dying declaration alleging gang-rape?

The cases relating to lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq and the rape victim in Kathua along with the politics of dominance surrounding such crimes show the state machinery as biased and unforgiving not qua the perpetrators but qua the victims. Any investigating agency has the ability to botch an investigation: manipulate records, fail to record statements of key witnesses, wilfully choose not to collect evidence crucial to the case, and ensure that witnesses incriminating the accused are not produced in court. The court finds itself helpless and occasionally chooses not to help itself and the law. When the nexus among the state, investigating agencies and the accused becomes the norm, the victim is the rule of law.

It is a wake-up call for the Republic. Some of our spineless institutions with their open biases have led to this abysmal state of affairs. The only institution that can withstand such aberrations that make the citizen lose faith in the functioning of the state is the court. Our future will depend on the court’s courage to call a spade a spade.

330,2020/10/07,Approaching the misinformation storm,"Those who use social media must pull in another direction to maintain access to a range of views

Echo chambers have been a defining character of smaller towns for a number of years. When I first went to the U.S. for postgraduate study, I chose a small town in New York state. The university was considered one of the best business schools in the world. The fact that the long since diminished Bausch & Lomb, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox were headquartered in the town meant the university was well-funded. It attracted star faculty despite the town’s small size and reputation for long, cold winters.

When I arrived there, however, I was horrified by the paucity of news. The local Democrat & Chronicle (derisively called the ‘Demagogue and Comical’) only covered news from the local county. There was no U.S. news to speak of, let alone global news. Having grown up on a diet of broadly focused Indian newspapers, this was anathema to me.

My indulgent father gifted me a subscription to the international edition of The Hindu, which was printed weekly and took at least a further week to arrive by post. It was only six pages in a small pamphlet format that could be folded and stuffed into a regular envelope to save on postage costs. Nonetheless, it gave me a much-needed view of international, Indian, and even U.S. news.

Biased ‘news’

In the 1980s, the penultimate decade of U.S. newspaper ascendancy, hundreds of news organisations existed to serve these sorts of towns, much like they still do in multilingual India today. The Internet put paid to all that. One would have thought that democratic access to a large variety of news from all corners of the globe would have opened up the echo chambers in towns and rural areas, but the hard fact is that the Internet has pulled the other way. There are far fewer news outlets now than there were some years ago.

The travesty is that many of these organisations are not news outlets; they are social networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter. These have no journalistic norms. Anyone can say anything at any time about any topic with scant respect for the truth. Everything is an opinion, but not clearly labelled as such. As a result, much of the ‘news’ available on these platforms is biased. The unscrupulous sale of personal information and meddling by inimical foreign regimes can potentially even influence the outcome of an election. Worse, the spread of false and malicious news can stoke violence at short notice. We have already seen this in India, when WhatsApp came under Indian regulatory scrutiny after a doctored video that originated as an innocent advertisement in Pakistan spread on that medium and stoked violence.

A stark warning

The ascendance of Jio and the response from its competition means that anywhere between 500 million and 700 million people are now newly online, almost all from towns and rural areas. The U.S.’s experience with the Internet should serve as a stark warning to India. Most Americans now get their news from dubious Internet sources. The hardening of political stances on both sides of the divide is plain to see, and the acute polarisation of the average American’s viewpoint is painful to watch. For India, the danger is that like the U.S., such extreme polarisation can happen in a few short years.

Also, the echo chamber has been greatly enhanced by the highly targeted algorithms that these companies use. The algorithms were built around making users stay online longer and click through to advertisements. They are likely to bombard users with information that serves to reinforce what the algorithm thinks the searcher needs to know. For instance, if I search for a particular type of phone on an e-commerce site even once, future searches are likely to autocomplete that search by showing that phone when I next open the app. It is the same with news. If I show a preference for right-wing leaning posts, for instance, the algorithms are likely to provide me with ever more right-wing posts from people and organisations.

As they familiarise themselves with the Internet, newly online Indians are bound to fall prey to the echo chamber algorithms that social network firms use, as well as other algorithms that ensure that they spend inordinate amounts of time within the bubble of one social network, therefore becoming easy marks for targeted advertising — both for products and of political viewpoints. Much can be said about how we should approach the impending Internet misinformation storm. I shall attempt to make a beginning here.

Things to do

First, we know that tech firms are already under fire from all quarters. Just as they are struggling to meet calls to contain the online spread of misinformation and hate speech online, they are being accused of suppressing both left-wing and right-wing views. There is no pleasing anyone on this issue. Nonetheless, we need to act.

Second, unlike the U.S., which has now become unlikely to directly regulate such firms, India might need to chart its own path by keeping them under check before they proliferate. In the U.S., these issues were not sufficiently legislated for and have existed for over a decade. Existing legislation has been tested by the American court system which has held that companies like Google and Facebook clearly engage in both free speech and press activities when they display content created by third-parties. Free speech is inherent in the Constitution of many other democracies, including India’s. This means that new Indian legislation needs to preserve free speech while still applying pressure to make sure that Internet content is filtered for accuracy, and sometimes, plain decency. Let us remember that our courts do not legislate; they ensure adherence to existing legislation.

The third issue is corporate responsibility. Facebook, for instance, has started to address this matter by publishing ‘transparency reports’ and setting up an ‘oversight board’ to act as a sort of Supreme Court for Facebook’s internal matters. However, for all these companies’ efforts at transparency, we cannot ignore the fact that these numbers reflect judgements that are made behind closed doors. What should be regulatory attempts to influence the transparency of information that members of the public see are instead being converted into secret corporate processes. We have no way of knowing the extent of biases that may be inherent inside each firm. The fact that their main algorithms target advertising and hyper-personalisation of content makes them further suspect as arbiters of balanced news. This means that those who use social media platforms must pull in another direction to maintain access to a range of sources and views. Whether this will be possible as the hinterland of India comes online is doubtful. We need strong intervention now. Else, in addition to the media, which has largely been the responsible fourth estate, we may well witness the creation of an unmanageable fifth estate in the form of Big Tech.

331,2020/10/07,A champion on and off court,"From being a girl of promise, Naomi Osaka has become an icon of hope

In tennis, it is rare to see an athlete truly grow up. This ‘growing up’ is not what it often means in sport: usually, the ability of a player to be disciplined, or not throw a tantrum when things don’t go right. This is more about finding their own self, a distinct voice; navigating a relentlessly demanding sport they have been trying to perfect since childhood. It may be easy if you are a veteran: all those years of weathering the endless rigmarole of touring, raking up ranking points and navigating sponsors comes with its own lessons. But how does someone young and introverted — almost to the point of being melancholic — like Naomi Osaka manage to find herself standing, barely three years after bursting onto the scene?

Osaka, 22, has often been described as ‘shy’, ‘innocent’ or ‘awkward’. Two years ago, she would tip-toe into press conferences and counter tough questions with self-deprecating humour. But when summer arrived this year, one saw in a world plagued by despair, a girl of promise become an icon of hope.

Amplifying voices

Osaka, who is the highest paid female athlete according to Forbes, was among the first to register her support for the Black Lives Matter movement. She flew to Minneapolis and attended protests surrounding the death of George Floyd. This was a transformed Osaka, someone whose life pivoted around the practice court. Floyd’s death at the hands of a white policeman had outraged much of the U.S., and when Osaka chose to stand among those who felt anguished, she was making a clear statement.

On social media, she amplified messages about organisations working for the Black Lives Matter movement and urged her fans to understand what it means to be a person of colour in America. She was, of course, met with the usual lamentations: why was an athlete commenting on issues that do not concern her sport? But Osaka remained unfazed. She became accutely aware of her reach and used the platform to facilitate change. In doing so, she made the sport relevant to issues plaguing the world today.

In what was perhaps the most defining moment in her role as a leader for social advocacy, Osaka announced that she would not be playing her semi-final match at the Western & Southern Open to protest against the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a young Black man, in Wisconsin. It was discernible then that playing good tennis was only going to be a subset of what Osaka stood for. As a result of her decision, the tournament itself paused play for one day.

In 2020, Osaka has redefined what it means to be a tennis player. It is not just about enthralling fans with deft shotmaking, filling up stadium seats and raking up TV views. It is also about making the sport a sanctuary where an athlete can achieve everlasting change.

Masks and the message

She brought seven masks into the U.S. Open with her, each emblazoned with the name of a Black person who was a victim of racially charged, law-enforcement confrontations. But wearing seven masks required playing seven matches, from the opening round to the final. Osaka did just that and more. Standing inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, named after a Black player who spent much of his life fighting prejudice, she won her third Grand Slam title, showing those who doubted her that it was possible to be a champion on and off court.

At the trophy ceremony, she was asked again about what message she wanted to send. The new Osaka, now brave and assertive, responded without missing a beat: “Well, what was the message you got, is more the question.”

A few hours and several thousand miles away, a Japanese TV show introduced the story behind each person on her masks. Osaka’s message had gone global.

332,2020/10/07,Coming up trumps in the virus fight,"Despite the belief that tests are the key to control of the pandemic (“Test! Test! Test!”), they are not infallible.

Which country has performed the highest number of COVID-19 tests? The United States. Which country’s President said he is safe because everyone who meets him at work or attends a political rally is pre-screened by virus testing? Again, the United States. Unfortunately, U.S. President Donald Trump has now been infected by the novel coronavirus despite all that testing. While wishing him a speedy recovery, we must wonder why that formidable cordon of testing did not prevent the virus from sneaking through. Also, why is the U.S. the global leader in COVID-19 deaths while testing at such high rates? The answers are relevant to other countries.

Also read: Donald Trump may not be out of the woods but can go home, says Conley

The ‘test’ strategy

Despite the belief that tests are the key to control of the pandemic (“Test! Test! Test!”), they are not infallible. They have inaccuracies arising from false negative and false positive results. False negatives mean that tests do not always detect the virus when present. This may be because the virus could not be picked by the swab early or late in the infection or that a defective sampling technique could not grab the virus. ‘Sensitivity’ is the ability of the test to detect the virus in persons who are truly infected. This is usually assessed in hospital cases where the diagnosis is highly probable on clinical criteria, as compared to persons who are judged to be virus free.

However, such ‘technical sensitivity’ is often higher than the ‘clinical sensitivity’ observed in field conditions, as pointed out in a recent paper by McAdam and Pettengill (“Can We Test Our Way Out of the COVID -19 Pandemic?”). Molecular tests such as real time RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) have a real world sensitivity between 60-70%. The Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT), when tested against RT-PCR as the gold standard, have a sensitivity ranging from 50-90%, according to different estimates. So, if RT-PCR has a sensitivity of 70% and RAT has a sensitivity of 70% compared to it, we run the risk of missing half the infected persons with RAT.

The other tests

While some manufacturers have claimed higher technical sensitivity with recent improvements, the rapid tests have been widely criticised for low sensitivity in field conditions. Yet, these are the tests that were used for screening officials, visitors and rally attendees who might pose a viral threat to the U.S. President.

Widespread use of tests for detection and isolation of infected cases, followed by tracing their contacts for testing and quarantine, with treatment of diagnosed cases, was promoted as the ‘Test-Trace-Treat’ formula by global and national health agencies. While this is conventional wisdom in infectious disease epidemics, the COVID-19 virus proved too tricky for this standard tackle. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic persons emerged as persons harbouring and discharging the virus. How many symptomless persons can we test in a large population, and how often?

Even for guiding treatment decisions, the only drug that has emerged so far with life-saving potential in seriously-ill hospitalised patients is dexamethasone. Steroids are not specific to COVID-19 and their use is dictated mainly by clinical state and not the test result.

Have we set too much in store by the testing rates in the population? When neighbouring countries are compared in any geographic zone, with similar socio-demographic and environmental conditions, there is absolutely no correlation between tests per million and deaths per million. Why is the death rate in Canada much lower than in the U.S. which has tested at a much higher rate? Across the world, the scatter is even wider. In contrast to the emphasis on testing rates, the U.S. did not fare well in contact tracing. It failed to mandate masks and faltered in persuading people to wear them, sending mixed political messages and conflicting technical advisories on their use.

Mask use

Some of the delay resulted from global health agencies taking time to unequivocally recommend the universal use of masks, despite the experiential wisdom of East and South East Asian countries in using masks to combat earlier respiratory virus epidemics. Would the world have been in a better place today if the World Health Organization’s call in March was “Mask! Mask! Mask!’? Perhaps, the clarion call for testing reflected the understanding at that time. We are better informed now. Yet, many in the U.S. remain impervious to evidence and advice on masks.

The U.S. also paid little heed to social distancing. The fractious political environment bred contempt for public health advice and positioned opposition to masks and physical distancing as a libertarian assertion of personal freedom.

The fact that ‘Super Spreader’ events promote rapid dissemination of infection from a few infected persons to many others is well known from past epidemics of respiratory viruses. This is akin to the Pareto principle, propounded by the Italian-Swiss economist Vilfredo Pareto that roughly 80% of the effects in many events come from 20% of the causes. We now know that 5-20% of the infected persons are responsible for spreading the virus to 80% of others who are infected. Since this happens mostly in crowded ‘Super Spreader’ events (where people congregate or travel together), testing is either not always possible or does not pick up the virus in asymptomatic persons.

Yet, indoor crowding can form virus clouds from such persons in confined spaces, endangering many others. Here too, universal masking offers the best protection. If only we could roll the clock back and recommend universal masking in January or February 2020. If only the President of the United States had regularly worn a mask and told others to do so too.

333,2020/10/07,Vanquishing viruses: On Nobel prize for medicine,"The Nobel Prize for Medicine is an inspiration to researchers working on SARS-CoV-2

At a time when the world is faced with multiple assaults from a frighteningly obscure virus, it cannot be mere coincidence that the Nobel Committee decided to anoint three scientists who peeled the layers off another virus that confounded generations of physicians — the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). The 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, to Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice, is a stout endorsement of years of work that went towards identifying one of the world’s greatest scourges. But to see it shorn of the context it is couched in would be to miss the larger point or purpose it could serve. Choosing researchers who went after a pathogen, and succeeded in unwrapping the whole puzzle at a time when others are fighting fatigue in a daily battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is also a hat tip to the virologists and geneticists burning the midnight oil, for over nine months now.

The accolades went to the three for identifying the viral origin of Hepatitis C. Their work, the Nobel statement said, characterised this form of hepatitis to be a distinct clinical entity, caused by an RNA virus of the Flavivirus family, now known as HCV. In fact, it was for the discovery of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV), and the development of the first-generation HBV vaccine, that Baruch Blumberg, whom the young Alter collaborated with, was awarded the 1976 Medicine Nobel. However, even the isolation of the HBV only partially eliminated the risk of contracting this severe liver disease transmitted through blood. The circle was only complete with the discovery of HCV. According to the WHO Global Hepatitis report, HBV and HCV are major causes for mortality and morbidity, with 1.34 million deaths reported in 2015, a 63% increase from 1990, mainly due to HCV. The number of deaths is also comparable to that caused by TB and higher than that caused by AIDS. The discoveries (of HBV and HCV), and the development of effective screening routines, have virtually eliminated the risk of transmission via blood products in much of the world. Also, with the development of effective drugs against HCV, it is possible that the threat of this viral infection will reduce, and hopefully, be eliminated soon. That is what makes this year’s Laureates’ achievement so tremendous. The Nobel Committee called it “among the most impactful scientific accomplishments of the 20th century”. In true lineage of other Nobel Prizes for Medicine, their identification represents “milestone achievements that have revolutionised medicine and substantially improved human health”. The triumph of humanity, over the pathogens that debilitate and kill men and women is certainly a singular achievement that is worth celebrating, and showcasing this achievement will send a deeply inspiring message at a time when another virus is holding the world to ransom.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vanquishing-viruses-on-nobel-prize-for-medicine/article32785917.ece
334,2020/10/07,Grapes of wrath: On Yogi Adityanath regime handling Hathras case,"The Yogi regime is trying to stigmatise legitimate outcry on the Hathras murder

The registration of multiple police cases in Uttar Pradesh on charges of conspiracy and sedition is an insensitive, albeit unsurprising, response to the legitimate outrage sparked by the way in which its officials had handled the aftermath of the gang rape and murder of a Dalit girl in Hathras. The State administration is seeking to convert the outcry and political advocacy into a putative conspiracy to foment caste discord. There seems to be inadequate recognition that initial attempts to deny that any rape took place and to prevent political leaders and the media from meeting the girl’s family pointed to an administrative posture hostile to the doing of complete justice. It was only to be expected that such an attitude would create a backlash against the State government. The only way to restore its image is to display empathy for the victim and treat protests seeking justice as legitimate. Even though the suspects named by the 19-year-old before her death in a Delhi hospital have been arrested and the FIR includes the charge of gang rape, there are clear signs that the Yogi Adityanath government is adopting dubious tactics to prevent what it sees as the crystallisation of public opinion against itself. Recognising that the formation of an SIT did not help undo the damage to the government’s image, the Chief Minister recommended a CBI investigation. However, even that came across as a move to fob off any adverse order from the Allahabad High Court, which has taken suo motu cognisance of the matter.

Remarks by senior police officers to the effect that there was no evidence of rape — citing the absence of semen in swabs taken for forensic analysis — indicated an official reluctance to acknowledge the gang-rape part of the offence. Latest reports suggest that a journalist on his way to Hathras and three others have been detained. They are also sought to be linked to the Popular Front of India, an organisation whose name came up in connection with recent riots and anti-government protests. This raises the suspicion of an attempt to control the narrative by resorting to a template of identifying members of a communal organisation as alleged conspirators and instigators of violence. The template includes the use of penal provisions relating to sedition and conspiracy and the projection of a theory that all protests and political activity against it constitute a plot to overthrow the government. A responsive government would have endeavoured to extend a healing touch, reassure the victims, and reserve its wrath for the offenders. Instead, the Adityanath government is focusing on blaming political leaders, pressuring the victim’s family and preventing the emergence of a united voice against sexual violence, attacks on the marginalised communities and the devastating effect an unregenerate caste hierarchy has on society.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/grapes-of-wrath-on-yogi-adityanath-regime-handling-hathras-case/article32785916.ece
335,2020/10/07,Prices of pulses in Bengaluru shoot up in two weeks; hoarding blamed,"Price rise comes in the immediate aftermath of the passage of the farm reform Bills, which, among other measures, deregulate trade in pulses

When Meenakshi from Banashankari went grocery shopping a few days ago, she was shocked to see that the price of toor dal had almost doubled in a little over a fortnight. Other pulses too had become more expensive.

While excess rain has had a role to play, industry insiders attribute the trend largely to the hoarding of pulses by “big players”.

It has created an artificial scarcity in the market, which in turn, has resulted in a rally in prices over the last two weeks.

For instance, toor dal that was trading in the range of ₹70–₹90 a kg two weeks ago, but was being quoted from ₹100–₹140 in the wholesale market on Saturday. The prices of other pulses have also shot up.

This price rise comes in the immediate aftermath of the recent farm reforms Bills, which among other measures deregulated trade in pulses. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, recently passed by Parliament and made into law, removed pulses, cereals, and oil seeds from the list of essential commodities.

“Big players have definitely resorted to hoarding over the last few weeks. However, unlike before, now that pulses are no longer an essential commodity, the government cannot check for stocks or intervene. The prices of pulses, cereals, and oil seeds will henceforth be prone to such artificial rallies,” said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, chairman, APMC Committee, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

At a recent meeting of stakeholders, including mill owners, farmers and government officers, in Kalaburagi, which is the biggest contributor of red gram in Karnataka, it emerged that an artificial scarcity in the market was the primary reason for the rally in prices.

Rithendra Sugoor, Joint Director of Agriculture, added that a premature assumption that this season’s harvest will be low had “prompted traders to keep the crop with them for better price”.

T.N. Prakash Kammardi, former chairman of the Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission, said that this artificial rise in prices had proved their argument against the recent farm reform Bills. “The government should not give up control over agriculture commodity marketing. The present system, as is being shown, neither helps farmers nor consumers, but only big corporates,” he alleged.

Farmers had sold red gram, from which toor dal is processed, at a low price of ₹6,100 a quintal earlier this year.

What has aggravated the situation is crop loss owing to excess rain in parts of the State in August–September. “Of the 5.5 lakh hectares that had redgram sown in Kalaburagi, crop on over 1 lakh hectares has been completely damaged,” said Mr. Sugoor. However, he hoped the yield in the rest of the area would be good.

Excess rain creates scarcity of onions

Excess rain in parts of the State in August and September led to large-scale crop damage that has now caused a severe scarcity of onions, driving its price northwards.

“The supply of onions has dropped to unprecedented levels. Crop loss was reported from almost all onion growing regions of the State starting from Sira, Molakalmur and Hubballi to Belagavi. What has worsened the situation is a similar crop loss in Maharashtra and Telangana as well,” said Ravi Kumar of Bangalore Onion and Potato Traders’ Association.

Onions are currently being traded at ₹40 a kg in the wholesale market, which has already pushed the retail price to above ₹50 level, sometimes even being sold at ₹60 a kg. However, despite paying a steep price, the quality of onions is poor.

“Waterlogging and increased soil moisture have damaged the crop hugely,” Mr. Ravi Kumar said.

All hopes are pinned on the next harvest from Rajasthan, which is expected to reach the market in November–December. If that fails, it will create a long period of acute scarcity till the next harvest in February, warn traders.

“If the Rajasthan crop is not adequate, we may see onion prices cross the ₹120 level, but then too, the quality may be very bad,” Mr. Kumar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/eelazm/article32797019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGSHOPP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hoarding-of-pulses-in-bengaluru-causes-prices-to-almost-double-in-two-weeks/article32797024.ece
336,2020/10/07,Union cabinet clears Bengaluru suburban rail project,"No formal announcement by the Union Railways Minister as the election model code of conduct is in place.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday reportedly cleared and approved the much delayed 148-km-long suburban rail project for Bengaluru, sources said. However, no formal announcement was made as the election model code of conduct is in place.

Bypolls are scheduled to be held in two Assembly constituencies – Rajarajeshwarinagar in Bengaluru and Sira in Tumakuru – on November 3.

According to sources, the proposed existing four corridors have been retained, but the estimated cost for the project had changed. Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE), the agency which is executing the project, will float the tender once a formal announcement is made, sources added.

While briefing the media after the Cabinet meeting, Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said that they could not give any information on the issue as the model code of conduct was in place in the city. However, he announced that the Union cabinet on Wednesday had given its approval for the revised cost for the Kolkata East-West Metro Corridor project.

The Bengaluru suburban rail project involves building four corridors connecting different parts of the city: KSR Bengaluru-Devanahalli, Baiyappanahalli-Chikkabanavara, Kengeri-Cantonment-Whitefield, and Heelalige-Rajanakunte.

Citizens’ groups and activists have carried out a series of campaigns for years to keep up pressure on governments to clear the project, which been mentioned in multiple Union budgets, including in 2019-20 and 2020-21.

However, a token amount of only ₹1 crore was allocated, as per the ‘Pink Book’ brought out by the Railways on Work, Machinery and Rolling Stock Programme of Railways for 2020-21, much to the disappointment of citizens of the city.

In the Union Budget 2020-21, the Centre announced that it would provide 20% of equity and facilitate external assistance up to 60% of the project cost, which was estimated at ₹18,600 crore. The project had been cleared by the Extended Railway Board (ERB) in November 2019.

Transport expert Sanjeev Dyamannavar of the advocacy group Praja said that now the focus should be on execution of the project as everything for start of the project was in place.

“K-RIDE is executing the project, the DPR is ready and there will not be any major issue with land acquisition as a major portion of the land for the project is with the Railways. Now, both the State and Union governments should allocate funds so that the project is implemented soon,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/9vcfqn/article32796991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGSUBURBANP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/union-cabinet-clears-bengaluru-suburban-rail-project-sources/article32796992.ece

338,2020/10/07,Bengaluru ranks 24th among 30 global cities in dementia innovation,"Study aims to uncover opportunities; experts recommend city-specific strategy to tackle prevalence of the brain disorder

Bengaluru has been ranked 24th in dementia innovation out of 30 global cities, according to a new report released on Wednesday by the Global Coalition on Aging (GCOA), Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) and the Lien Foundation.

The report, ‘Dementia Innovation Readiness Index 2020: 30 Global Cities’, evaluates the readiness of 30 cities to develop and adopt innovations in dementia and aims to uncover where there are opportunities for innovation across the global dementia community.

Dementia is a progressive neuro-degenerative brain disorder that affects memory, language, problem-solving abilities, and progressively affects the ability to function independently. The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease.

Dementia innovation readiness is defined in the above-mentioned index as the level to which each city is prepared to innovate in terms of novel approaches, systems, or processes that would have an impact on the prevention, treatment, or care of dementia.

The report examines 26 indicators across five categories of innovation readiness – strategy/commitment, early detection/diagnosis, access to care, community support and business environment.

The report found that Bengaluru ranks 24 out of the 30 cities evaluated with an overall score of 5.2 out of 10. The city scored low in strategy and commitment, and business environment. Of around two lakh dementia patients in Karnataka, nearly 40,000 are in Bengaluru.

Meera Pattabiraman, chair of Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI), said that Bengaluru should focus on a dementia strategy going forward.

“In Bengaluru, experts have implemented community-based screening tools that are calibrated to address specific local issues, like low education rates and heterogeneous cultures and languages,” she said. “Developing a city-specific strategy should be a priority for Bengaluru to address dementia prevalence, and plans have been set in motion to formulate such a strategy.”

P.T. Sivakumar, professor of psychiatry and consultant in Geriatric Psychiatry Unit, Department of Psychiatry in NIMHANS, said Bengaluru is among the leading cities in India to have many active initiatives to cover prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for dementia.

“Major governmental organisations like NIMHANS, Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) and several non-governmental organisations have made active contributions and innovations in this field. However, considering the global standards and the growing need, we need to further enhance these initiatives into a strategic plan that can have a comprehensive approach to this issue,” he said.

Stating that there is a need to create awareness for early diagnosis, reducing stigma and facilitating care with dignity, Dr. Sivakumar said training of primary care physicians and health workers to identify dementia and provide appropriate initial management is required.

“Training of family and professional caregivers for dementia care is also important. There is a need to develop a complete range of care systems that are affordable and accessible for those with limited economic capacity on priority. Promoting technological innovations that can support persons with dementia to maintain independence and ensure good quality of life are most important,” he explained.

Radha S. Murthy, president of ARDSI’s Bengaluru chapter, said the Society was working towards making Bengaluru dementia-friendly by 2025.

“Our support systems are good compared to other cities. We have brought down the cost of care by 40% through tele-medicine. Awareness has increased as a result of which stigma has reduced,” she said.

ADI Chief Executive Paola Barbarino said that local leadership is critical in preparing for dementia. “A willingness to act at a local leadership level has been clearly linked to a city’s preparedness and ability to innovate,” she pointed out.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-ranks-24th-among-30-global-cities-in-dementia-innovation/article32796472.ece
339,2020/10/07,Passport appointments back to normal,"But the number of applicants has come down by 50%

After having to reduce the number of appointments amidst a raging pandemic, the Regional Passport Office (RPO), Bengaluru recently restored the number of appointments to normal after adopting the necessary precautionary measures. But the surge in COVID-19 cases is keeping nearly half of them vacant.

As on Wednesday, the number of normal appointments available at the Lalbagh Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) was 1,200. Another 600 were available at the Marathahalli PSK, and 100 enquiry slots at the Koramangala office. In Hubballi-Dharwad and Mangaluru, 450 normal appointments were available.

Regional Passport Officer Bharath Kumar Kuthati told The Hindu that only half or less than half the appointments have been taken. “The number of appointments taken has come down to 40% from pre-COVID-19 times. But it has been steadily increasing – from 20% post the first lockdown to around 40% now. Air travel suspension and international travel restrictions were major factors, apart from a general trend of avoiding crowded places,” he said.

In March, just days before the first lockdown was announced, the Ministry of External Affairs sent out a directive to reduce appointments. The Bengaluru RPO had then announced a reduction in appointments by half, with officials requesting applicants to return home if they were suffering from symptoms or did not want the passport service as an emergency.

“Till a month ago, we had reduced appointments to 50% of the regular number at the PSKs. There were no operations at the Post Office PSKs (POPSKs). We were going by indication given by the Department of Posts. They expressed their readiness a month ago. Since then, we’ve started functioning. PSKs started operating earlier,” Mr. Kuthati explained.

Most POPSKs in the State are offering between 20 and 30 appointments.

“All our centres are following the Central guidelines scrupulously. Both at the PSKs and POPSKs as well as RPO, wearing of masks, use of sanitisers and maintaining social distancing are being implemented. Initially, we reduced appointments by 50%. But over a period of time, we observed that footfalls have not been more than 50%. So, we’ve opened 100% of all appointments. At POPSKs, we are offering appointments depending on the Department of Posts’ request. At the PSKs, we’re seeing if we need additional personnel. But that may not be necessary as of now,” the RPO added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/3zfrsv/article32796366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGPASSP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/passport-appointments-back-to-normal/article32796367.ece
340,2020/10/07,Drugs probe: CCB questions Ricky Rai on Alva’s whereabouts,"Police suspect him of giving shelter to the accused, and have confiscated his phone

A day after raiding his residence, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) on Wednesday questioned Ricky Rai, the son of the former underworld don-turned-social activist late Muthappa Rai, in connection with a drug racket.

“We summoned him for questioning again to ascertain the whereabouts of Aditya Alva, one of the key accused who is absconding. We believe Ricky had given shelter to the accused,” said a senior CCB official.

The CCB has confiscated Ricky’s phone for technical analysis in the hope that the data will shed some light on their probe. The police suspect him of being in touch with some of the accused in the drug peddling racket and attending parties they had organised.

“The main focus of the investigations right now is to track down Shiva Prakash, the prime accused in the drug case, Sheikh Faazil and Aditya Alva. They are crucial to the case,” the official added.

Alva, who is the son of the late minister Jeevaraj Alva, and others have been accused of organising parties and facilitating the sale and use of drugs. Many of the accused were regular visitors to the farmhouse of Alva where parties were organised on weekends, claim the CCB.

On Tuesday, CCB officials reached Ricky’s apartment at Sadashiva Nagar. His car, which was parked in the garage, was also searched, said sources.

The city police unravelled the plot behind a robbery at a businessman's house in T. Nagar, and arrested eight suspects who were allegedly involved in the crime.

The complainant Noorul Yakub, 71, has a construction business in Dubai. Yakub said he, his wife Anisha, her nephew and their domestic help have been under home quarantine at their house on Saradambal Street in T. Nagar, as they tested positive for COVID-19. One of their relatives, Moideen from Thoothukudi district, has been staying with them for the past two weeks.

According to police, unidentified persons entered the house on the evening of September 30, and made away with 120 sovereigns of gold jewellery and ₹95,000 cash, other valuables and a high-end car, after tying up Mr. Yakub and his family members. Mr. Moideen had also gone missing, and his mobile phone was switched off. The family members managed to untie themselves and reported the incident to the police over the phone.

Pondy Bazaar police began an investigation into the complaint. On scrutiny of CCTV footage, the police found the suspects arrived on three bikes.

Police arrested Mahesh, 33, Sugumar, 27, Lokesh, 25, of Guduvanchery and five others. Moideen who is suspected to be the main perpetrator, is still at large. Special teams have been constituted to trace him.

344,2020/10/07,Elective surgeries resume in Chennai’s government hospitals,"The procedures were put on hold because of the pandemic

After spending the last six months focusing primarily on COVID-19, a number of government hospitals have slowly started performing elective surgeries.

In the wake of COVID-19 cases, elective surgeries were put on hold in a number of government hospitals such as the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). These hospitals had earmarked wards for COVID-19 patients and had been handling hundreds of patients in the last six months. They have resumed elective surgeries with precautionary measures in place.

RGGGH, which has been handling thousands of COVID-19 patients, started to perform elective surgeries from Monday. “Every day, we perform 15 to 20 emergency surgeries. We had four to five elective surgeries on Monday that included neuro and ENT. We can increase the number of surgeries slowly as we are handling several COVID-19 patients. We are readying the operation theatre for cardiac procedures too,” E. Theranirajan, Dean of RGGGH, said.

He added that prior to surgery, patients were screened for COVID-19.

“If they are clinically symptomatic, we do a CT scan. If there are any findings, we put the surgery on hold,” he added.

At Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, a senior doctor said they had started to take up elective surgeries last month. “It is slowly picking up. We are doing RT-PCR tests for the patients before the surgeries,” he said.

Another surgeon said they started performing surgeries in July. “We have been doing all surgeries — both minor and major — except transplant and open heart surgeries. We have been doing both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 work. All standard universal precautions and protocols are being followed,” he said.

P. Vasanthamani, Dean of Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, said the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (OG), Burns and Orthopaedics had been continuously performing elective surgeries.

“Nearly 50% of our beds are allocated for COVID-19 patients. So, we have about 600 beds for OG, paediatrics, burns and cardiology units. We have not stopped elective surgeries. While cardiology is doing limited procedures, both surgery and urology departments are performing elective surgeries,” she said.

Affiliate assistance

Earlier, the hospital referred a few cases to its affiliated institute, Government Royapettah Hospital (GRH), and also the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital. KMC and GRH have performed a total of 5,000 surgeries from April to September.

This included 3,383 major surgeries.

As elective surgeries are back on track, safety of the patient and health workforce was the main aim, a doctor of Government Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Women and Children said. “We have now started performing elective surgeries with COVID-19 precautions. However, we do not encourage surgery if a patient belongs to the high risk category, that is has diabetes or hypertension or is morbidly obese, and if it can be postponed for two to three months later. Such patients require in-patient care before the surgery and this is a risk. We are doing the necessary investigations - RT-PCR test and CT scan - prior to surgery,” she said

She said that doctors followed all safety precautions and educated the patients.

“Still, we have patient relatives crowding at the hospital. Most of them keep their masks lowered and this is worrying as the COVID-19 incidence is rising in the city,” she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/81vspa/article32787077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THRGGGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/elective-surgeries-resume-in-chennais-government-hospitals/article32787078.ece
345,2020/10/07,Port-Maduravoyal corridor likely to have two more ramps,"NHAI studying the feasibility of the proposal, say officials

The Chennai Port-Maduravoyal Elevated Expressway Corridor that is being presently revived is likely to have ramps at Spurtank Road and Swami Sivananda Salai.

This will allow vehicles other than those proceeding to and from the port to use it.

Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said they were studying the feasibility of the proposal to construct up and down ramps at the locations.

The State Highways Department insisted during a meeting with the NHAI that the ramps should be constructed as planned earlier, according to sources.

“The project had been put on hold since the alignment was not proper. A change in the pillars was made and somewhere in this process, the two ramps seemed to have dropped,” a source in the department said.

Original plan

A former official of the Highways Department said the corridor’s original plan included three ramps — at Koyambedu, Spurtank Road and at Swami Sivananda Salai — apart from the up and down ramps at the port and at Maduravoyal on Poonamallee High Road.

“In the affidavit submitted by the NHAI in the court, they said the corridor would be used to evacuate ambulances and other vehicles. If these ramps are not provided, it would only be a waste of public money. The State government has spent so much on rehabilitation of families living along the Cooum river, along which most of the 19.2-km-long alignment of the corridor runs. The government has borne 50% of the cost of land acquisition and relief and rehabilitation,” he pointed out.

The Madras High Court in its February 2014 order has also pointed out that “the traffic congestion from Maduravoyal to Chennai Port, which runs through thickly populated middle portion of the city, will be reduced and the school and college going students and travelling public will be benefited by saving travelling time.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/port-maduravoyal-corridor-likely-to-have-two-more-ramps/article32787055.ece
346,2020/10/07,"Why are tin sheets used to block entrances, asks Madras High Court","GCC Commissioner told to appear before Division Bench

The Madras High Court on Tuesday expressed its displeasure over the practice adopted by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) of using tin sheets to block entries and exits to places where COVID-19 patients have been detected and subjected to home quarantine.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha directed GCC Commissioner G. Prakash to appear before them through video conferencing on November 10 and explain the rationale behind blocking entrances to individual houses using tin sheets.

The judges wanted to know if there was a scientific basis behind such a course adopted by the Corporation and whether any of the guidelines issued by the Centre or the State government permit the use of tin sheets to block entrances.

Question of hygiene

The Bench also wanted the Corporation to explain whether facilities for institutional quarantine were being maintained hygienically. The interim orders were passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate R. Priyanka.

She argued the case in person and complained to the court that her husband was forcibly taken to an unhygienic institutional quarantine facility by Corporation officials, though he was asymptomatic and could have been subjected to home quarantine.

Stating that they were living in a five-bedroom house, the petitioner accused the sanitary inspector of having ordered institutional quarantine on grounds that their house did not have two separate rooms or separate toilets, was in a slum area and had no cross ventilation.

She said the inspector filled the referral form mechanically, without even visiting her house. She alleged that her husband was treated disrespectfully by the Corporation officials on August 20 when his test results returned positive for COVID-19.

He was taken straight to an institutional quarantine facility because civic officials were interested in showing numbers at such facilities, so that the funds allocated by the Centre, for their maintenance, could be misappropriated, the litigant alleged.

On August 23, civic officials blocked the main door to her house with tin sheets. “The officials, instead of blocking our main gate, blocked our front door, making it impossible for us to come out in case of emergencies like fire and other health-related problems,” she added. Finding some force in her submissions, the senior judge in the Bench told the Corporation counsel to explain the amount of money spent on such tin sheets, whether contracts had been awarded to private firms and whether the sheets were being reused.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ttlbxk/article32786987.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7THCORPORATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/why-are-tin-sheets-used-to-block-entrances-asks-madras-high-court/article32786988.ece

A 22-year-old was arrested by the Avadi police for killing a two-year-old by attacking him with a ladle because of a grudge against the child’s mother.

Police identified the victim as Gokulraj, the second child of Harikrishnan, 32, who works in a private firm, and his wife Bagyalakshmi, 26, a fish vendor in Shasthri Nagar, Pulianthope.

Ms. Bagyalakshmi initially opposed her sister Bhavani’s love marriage with Arunkumar but the sisters eventually patched up.

Arunkumar and his wife recently moved into a house in Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, Avadi, and Gokulraj was staying with them.

On September 5, Arunkumar admitted the child to the Government Children’s Hospital, Egmore, claiming that he had sustained injuries after falling down some stairs.

Ms. Bagyalakshmi suspected foul play and lodged a complaint.

Eight persons, who are suspected to have been involved in the murder of an advocate in Villivakkam, surrendered before a court at Vaniyambadi in Tirupattur district on Tuesday.

K. Rajesh, 45, founder of a little-known political party Makkal Aalum Arasiyal, was hacked to death near Villivakkam on Sunday.

The victim was said to be a relative of history-sheeter Somu. He was also cited as an accused in connection with the murder of an advocate on the Egmore court premises in 2015.

On Sunday, he was standing outside his house when a group of men attacked him with machetes. There were cut injuries on his head, an officer said.

After the gang fled, the Villivakkam police sent the body for post-mortem examination at the Kilpauk Medical College Hospital.

Four special teams were constituted to trace the accused.

350,2020/10/07,"During special drive, police seize 510 kg of ganja in Madhavaram","Intensive checking under way across the city, says Police Commissioner

City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal on Tuesday said police personnel were conducting an intensive special drive against drugs across the city.

Over 1,680 kg of ganja was seized from drug cartels in the last three months. As many as 201 cases were booked and 368 accused arrested for possession and sale of the contraband, he said.

Trailed gang for 3 days

On Tuesday, the Commissioner inspected a major seizure of ganja by a special team of police personnel in Madhavaram. The team led by Madhavaram Deputy Commissioner of Police K. Balakrishnan shadowed a gang for three days.

On the receipt of credible information, they intercepted a tanker lorry carrying contraband from Andhra Pradesh in the early hours of Tuesday.

On inspecting the tanker, they found a secret chamber in which the ganja was concealed.

The contraband was being smuggled from Vishakapatinam to Chennai and from here to Madurai, the police said.

About 510 kg of ganja was seized and the driver was arrested.

The total worth of the contraband could be around ₹70 lakh, they added.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Aggarwal said, “All personnel have been taking effective action. We are not stopping with just the seizure of drugs and the arrest of suppliers, we also trace the retailers and nab them as well. In case the retailers are caught, we also trace the origin and nab the suppliers. We are also arresting suspects who are holed up in Andhra Pradesh.”

Mr. Aggarwal said going by statistics, it could not be said that the number of murders had suddenly risen. He listed out the steps which had been taken to reduce the crime rate.

“We are trying to prevent all crime and are invoking the Goondas Act against history-sheeters. The Deputy Commissioners in 12 police districts are using the powers conferred on them to frequently initiate proceedings against the offenders,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/abuw8u/article32786814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06OCTTHMOTHERLOAD-GANJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/during-special-drive-police-seize-510-kg-of-ganja-in-madhavaram/article32786815.ece
351,2020/10/07,Tiruvottiyur Theradi Metro inauguration may be delayed,"Problems in land acquisition affect pace of construction

When Chennai Metro Rail’s phase I extension project from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar opens, commuters living near Tiruvottiyur Theradi may not be able to use it as the station is unlikely to be ready before the inauguration by early next year, sources said.

This project is meant to cover 9 km of north Chennai with stops at nine stations — Washermenpet, Thiyagaraya College, Tondiarpet, New Washermenpet, Tollgate, Kaladipet, Tiruvottiyur Theradi, Tiruvottiyur and Wimco Nagar. While Thiyagaraya College and Tondiarpet are being built as underground stations, the remaining ones are elevated structures.

Usually, underground stations consume more time than the elevated ones; in this case, both Thiyagaraya College and Tondiarpet will be constructed and ready for inauguration while Tiruvottiyur Theradi, an elevated one, is likely to remain unfinished, sources said.

It is likely to be opened only a few weeks after the inauguration if the contractor doesn’t speed up the construction and pump in more manpower now. “The viaduct is not connected to the station yet. It is not clear how they can finish on time,” a source said.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), there was a delay in land acquisition, which subsequently affected the pace of construction.

“It took a lot of time to get access to the land required for the station. So, naturally, it had an impact and caused a delay in finishing it. Right now, we have been taking measures to complete it at the earliest and get it ready for inauguration,” an official said.

The detailed project report estimates that the station might see nearly 22,000 passengers by 2026.

CMRL is installing a signalling telecommunication system for this project. In addition, the laying of tracks along the 9 km-stretch is nearly over and is likely to be finished in another week or 10 days.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/78ed86/article32786728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06OCTTHUNFINISHED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tiruvottiyur-theradi-metro-inauguration-may-be-delayed/article32786729.ece

354,2020/10/07,The disintegration of the criminal justice system,"A problem-solving system handled by the executive is taking shape; establishing truth through trials has ceased to exist

A well-established textbook on the principles of criminal law in the United Kingdom painstakingly establishes various theoretical bases for justifying what should be a crime — that it should involve some harm, must carry a certain degree of seriousness, and so on. But then, revealingly, it undoes this edifice in a single section by telling us that at the end of the day, criminal law and crimes are whatever the state says it is. In India, this political nexus is arguably more pronounced: A majority government makes the laws and controls the investigative machinery, which means that not only does it define what a crime is but it can also selectively pursue only those crimes which it cares about and forget about the rest.

In disarray across India

Pursue those crimes to what end, you ask. Ultimately, the idea of “crime” is hollow without the accompanying punishment. The loss of liberty upon imprisonment we are all taught to dread. However, it is often forgotten that this punishment can only arise upon a judgment of conviction at the end of a trial. There is, then, a synergy between the crime, its pursuit by an investigation, and the calling to account of those found guilty, which is colloquially referred to as a criminal justice system. And wherever one looks across India, it is in a shambles.

The morbid happenings in the State of Uttar Pradesh are but one stark example of just how bad things can get. A notorious gangster was involved in a gunfight with police, fled, and was later captured from another State. In the meanwhile, the news was awash with stories alleging corrupt links of the accused to public servants. As his entourage made its way back to Uttar Pradesh, there was an “encounter” and the accused was shot dead.

There was a crime, several crimes in fact. The State police decided to pursue it. However, there was no waiting for a trial to condemn the accused and sentence him; punishment was swiftly meted out by the police itself. So much so, that an erstwhile Supreme Court Judge felt that the State’s version of events made it appear as if it did not even care whether the encounter story was believed or not.

Extremes in Uttar Pradesh

If the Vikas Dubey encounter death demonstrated a willingness to punish without condemning an accused through trial, Uttar Pradesh has also demonstrated a willingness to condemn without any trial. It passed a law enabling the publishing of massive hoardings with the names and personal details of persons allegedly involved in the destruction of property caused in riots following the anti-Citizenship Act protests. But, here is the thing: all of this is before a court convicted them for these acts. Rather, the power to condemn was sourced not from a judicial order, but from the power to level allegations, which is wholly executive in scope. In this fashion, the police became judge, jury, and executioner.

Of course, these instances are where the State decided to pursue alleged crime. There are many cases where it turns a blind eye to incidents of violence, either indefinitely or for long enough. A young girl was brutally assaulted and left to die when she was found by her family on September 14 in the village of Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. The same family did what anyone would do — report the incident to the police while they rushed their daughter to a hospital. Only, here, despite the injuries being evident, the police did not register a case for hours, and even then did not include the serious offence of rape. Of course, where the police was not willing to register this single case of rape, it has swiftly registered at least 19 cases regarding an alleged conspiracy to use the incident for political purposes to show the State in a bad light.

Govt.-judiciary disconnect

There are clear, discernible tendencies which these examples from the State of Uttar Pradesh only serve to demonstrate. These are, first, the growing disconnect between the government and judiciary in matters of criminal justice; second, the bolstering of executive power as a result of this growing disconnect, and third, the unsurprising imitation of executive-mindedness by the judiciary. The result of this, I argue, is a transformation from a criminal justice system, to a problem-solving system.

The Crime in India data for 2019 confirm a trend that has been on display for decades now: our police are seemingly super-efficient, but our courts are super-slow. Let us continue with Uttar Pradesh as an example. Its police have a pendency rate for cases at just above 15%, but the courts have pendency rates just above 90% (for IPC crimes). And, worryingly, these are not the worst figures. What this means is that as police forces keep adding to the docket every year, the courts are becoming ever slower in their ability to conduct trials and pass judgments.

This exacerbates the natural time-gap between the incident and any potential punishment, and reduces the importance of courts in the criminal justice system. Among other things, this disconnect also reduces whatever value condemnation through trial might have had, as people move on and so does life in almost all cases. Just how severely this tendency is magnified in an era defined by the 24-hour news cycle is anyone’s guess.

How does a system fill this gap between incident and eventual judgment? By slowly legitimising the idea of punishments without condemnation or any kind of being called into account. All that matters, is solving the problem, and moving on.

This system where judges lose sway is where the executive gains more power. It is the arrest, and not a conviction, which becomes the seminal moment in the criminal process. Victims do not even think as far as proving anything in court, at times, and all that matters is arrest and an indefinite incarceration, or even an encounter if the allegation is heinous enough. At the same time, the executive tries to legally bolster powers of pre-trial arrest and custody, while also arrogating to itself more powers to punish without condemnation — asset forfeiture being a key power.

Presumption of innocence

The transformation stands complete, when judges try to regain some of their lost footing by trying to imitate the now popular branch. Courts become happy to look at facts, in detail, at the stage of bail itself. What is more, courts also become willing to help arrive at settlements through this stage by using incarceration as a bargaining tool to force errant accused persons to make reparations. In doing so, courts actively replace facts established through cross-examination of a witness with her untested allegations that the police decided to pursue, because even courts no longer have the time for the process either. The presumption of innocence be damned, so long as the problem is solved and a victim can go home satisfied.

Amidst this pandemic and the spiralling chaos that it has brought, there has been a comforting background score that has steadily played on. This is the systematic disintegration of any criminal justice system worth its name across India, and its gradual replacement with a problem-solving system where initial accusations and their handling by the executive branch becomes most critical and values such as the presumption of innocence and establishing truth through trials have long ceased to exist. That certain States are at the vanguard of this progression could, perhaps, cynically be seen as yet another symptom of their development which makes many others envious.

355,2020/10/07,"Letters to the Editor — October 7, 2020","Hathras fallout

The strategy by the Uttar Pradesh government to level the charge of a ‘conspiracy’ by some groups and individuals to instigate caste and communal violence’ in the State is nothing but this — a diversionary tactic (Page 1, “U.P. police allege bid to trigger caste violence”, October 6). The State government needs to answer these questions: Why was the girl from Hathras, who was practically mutilated, cremated in the early hours of the day and in such a tearing hurry, violating, in the process, the rights of her family? Who ordered the girl’s cremation and why? Why was the victim’s family isolated? Why were political leaders who wanted to console the victim’s family not allowed to meet them initially? It is surprising that most of the very articulate and senior women Ministers in the Union cabinet have not said a word about the incident.

A. Jainulabdeen,

It appears that women’s safety has become a casualty in Uttar Pradesh. What is worrisome is that the police appear to be hand in glove with the State in attempting to deny justice to the victim and her family. The State administration is in a state of deep slumber while the rest of India is in a state of shock. Ironically, the protectors of the law unabashedly shield the perpetrators of crimes.

P.K. Varadarajan,

Chennai

It may not be an exaggeration to say the cases of assault against women are on the rise in India, and most of us are reacting only when the degree of injury inflicted on the victim or survivor shakes the human conscience.

It is worrying that crime against women is not being given the attention it deserves. It is akin to inflicting a grievous wound on the nation. Women in India need to be safe anywhere and at all times.

Mritunjay Pathak,

Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh

One shudders to think of the pain and the mental agony the victim would have undergone. It is jungle raj in Uttar Pradesh where the perpetrators of crime are safe and where the law of the land appears to be for the upper castes. After Hathras, the BJP’s slogan “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” cannot sound more hollow. People who do not raise their voice against atrocities on women are only silently acknowledging acts of violence.

G.B. Sivanandam,

Coimbatore

It is clear that there is still a long road ahead of India in purging our culture and its psyche of the deeply embedded toxicity of male dominance. The case mirrors a typical caste-ridden patriarchal set-up that bestows a sense of entitlement on a certain section of men. The horrific act has a familiar script — of lapses by the state. The much tom-tommed laws in trying to ensure better safety for women after the 2012 Delhi case are proving to be ineffective to deterring offenders and predators. . As long as the social prejudice that devalues women is not rooted out, it is not quite a country for women.

Lesson for POTUS

Not very long ago, the U.S. President, Donald Trump, dismissed the novel coronavirus as another flu and that it would go away. We in India had a more scientific mindset and hence were more respectful to this affliction. Mr. Trump, like a western cowboy, was acting plain macho and is now afflicted. The virus is having its merry course, irrespective of science or geography. An under-treatment Mr. Trump must be wondering if his bravado will now cost him his second term. Should he fortuitously find his way back to the Oval office post November 2020, one can only hope that he revises his assessment of the World Health Organization and underwrites the U.S.’s role as a responsible member in international institutions that promote scientific inquiry into the strange ways of nature and our ability to understand them.

Academic year

As a parent of B. Tech and Junior college students, I feel this academic year should be declared a ‘zero year’ due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, it has only been one-sided online classes without practicals and a truncated syllabus. Parents are worried as children are least interested in online classes. Educational institutions are more interested in the collection of fees for their own survival than the fate of students. Without field practicals, especially in engineering and science, one can only imagine the quality of students.

356,2020/10/07,Enhance your upper body with rock rings,"Rock rings, used to practise climbing, can be added to home workouts to enhance upper body and core strength

Used to improve climbing skills, rock rings not only enhance finger grip but also add value to regular upper body and core strength workouts. Rock rings are inexpensive, portable and can be hung easily over bars, tree limbs or any surface which can take the load of your body.

The ring is designed for different finger grips. From a full grip at the very top — also known as the jug — for four fingers and three- and two-finger grips at the bottom of the ring. The idea is for your body to be able to pull its weight when climbing up a mountain, using just two fingers.

Of course, this will be assisted by a strong core and the upper body muscles. The fingers can be partially or fully bent. They will be sore in the beginning but as the callouses form, the sensitivity will reduce as will the abrasions. Remember to keep the elbows slightly bent, scapulae (shoulder blades) retracted and all the upper body muscles actively engaged. This will prevent any strain on the joints of the elbows, on the neck and the upper back. The lower back should be neutral at all times.

Keep the workout as simple and compact as possible — a few minutes, to begin with. And then progress according to your individual abilities and goals. As always, warm up. A 15-minute moderate to intense warm up should include full body movements like jogs with arms pumping, jumping jacks, spot jogs, burpees or anything that makes you sweat. At the end, cool down. Include stretches for all the upper body and upper back muscles. Rolling is also a good option.

The basic moves

Hold these for 10 seconds at a time. You can do two or three repetitions if you wish. Increase the duration of the holds as you get better.

Straight arm hang

Use the four fingerhold to hang on, without bending the arms at the elbow.

Bent arm hang

In a half-pull up position, with arms bent at the elbow.

Offset hangs

Shift your bodyweight to one side, loading one arm at a time.

Pull ups

Pull yourself up until your shoulder is on the same level as the rings. Here, it is important that the lower body be totally silent (or inactive).

Offset pull ups

Shift your bodyweight to one side, performing one arm pull-up at a time.

L hang

Choose a grip you can work with. Maintaining all the posture guidelines, lift the legs to a 90 degree position and hold.

Sample workout

This 10-minute workout is for advanced athletes; scale it down to half if you are a beginner, following all the posture and safety guidelines.

1. Pull ups using the uppermost edge of the rings for one minute.

2. Bent arm hang, followed by straight arm hang, using the three finger pocket.

3. Offset pull ups or single arm pull ups, using the upper edge.

4. Bend arms to do a hanging sit using the upper edge. Bring both knees towards the chest and hold.

5. Straight arm sit reps are the same exercise as above, but repeat the knee ups.

6. Straight arm hang using two or three finger pockets.

7. Sit hang using four finger pocket. Keep the legs straight ahead, without bending the knees.

8. Pull ups using the upper edge.

9. Straight arm hang, followed by single arm hang, using three finger pockets.

358,2020/10/07,Carnivorous plants have got the attention of gardening enthusiasts in the country,"Many of them are falling prey to the captivating beauty of these plants

“If possible, I would have filled my house with Nepenthes (pitcher plants),” laughs Dr Payel Sarkar. At her home in Uran, Navi Mumbai, Payel grows different varieties of carnivorous plants; she also hosts workshops on these plants for school students.

Payel is among a growing tribe of carnivorous plant growers in India. Says Partha Pratim Borah from Nagaon, Assam, “There were not many growers when I started collecting these 12 years ago, but things are different now.” Partha has over 10,000 plants in his ever-growing nursery, and last year, he resigned his job to devote more time to his collection.

Besides Nepenthes, the varieties that are commonly grown and sold in India include Venus flytraps, Droseras (sundews), Utricularias (bladderworts), Pinguiculas (Butterworts) and Sarracenias (American Pitcher Plant).

Wilson C Varghese, owner of Vinay Gardens in Kozhikode, Kerala, began his tryst with carnivorous plants two decades ago, during the inauguration of Malabar Botanical Garden and Institute for Plant Sciences in his hometown.

“I spent ₹1,000 to get my first. Although rodents destroyed it a few months later, I could replant it,” says 60-year-old Wilson. Today, his nursery is a leading producer of hybrid species of Nepenthes (over 30 of them), and he has a clientèle across India.

Chennai-based K. Shivaramakrishnan remembers how some people made fun of him when he decided to collect the plants.

“I loved growing exotic stuff and, as you know, these guys are not normal. Finally, I got a plant imported from Malaysia, for which I had to shell out ₹7,000-8000, inclusive of shipping cost,” says Shiva, a senior product engineer with Computational Brain Research at IIT Madras.

He has also been running Forest Studio, an online shop, which “study, choose and sell rare, exotic and borderline endangered plant species.

Social media has played a huge role in popularising these plants. When Prajay Jervis Fernandes from Thane, Mumbai, started the Facebook community ‘Carnivorous Plants India’ five years ago, it was out of a desire to find fellow hobbyists.

“The community now has over 1,600 members, and is a forum for sellers and for new growers to clear their doubts,” says the 33-year-old, whose favourite is a Nepenthes that “does not kill”. The lower surface of the lid contains a sweet sugary laxative which is tempting for tree shrews. It causes them to involuntarily poop inside the pitcher. This poop is high in nitrogen, thus providing the nutrient for the plant, he adds.

Payel, meanwhile, has her Instagram page (@traps_and_leafs) flooded with photos of the plants from her garden. The collectors note that the world of carnivorous plants is mysterious. They argue that there is more to them than what our science classes in school have let on.

“I consider them intelligent and sophisticated. Even humans and animals have to go in search of food, but they get it delivered directly. Their morphological features are bizarre in the most beautiful way, and some of them have the loveliest flowers,” says N. Nirmal Kumar, a gardening enthusiast from Kochi, who owns a terrarium of carnivorous plants, and runs the YouTube channel, Nandanam Exotics, dedicated to gardening. Shiva makes note of Drosophyllum lusitanicum that is fussy and Stylidium that becomes carnivorous only when they wish to flower.

N Nirmal Kumar | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

Carnivorous plants are grown from seeds, from cuttings and by tissue culture. Seeds or plants are imported from Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Americas and Europe. Rates differ as per variety. Sundews are priced ₹250 onwards; the cost of Nepenthes start at ₹600 and can go up to several thousands. Venus flytraps and Sarracenia cost upwards of ₹700. Meanwhile, a pack of seeds cost around ₹300.

“Refrain from buying seeds from unknown or unverified sellers on e-commerce platforms, as there can be fake or old seeds in the consignment,” adds Prajay.

The plants require good sunlight and the soil should be nutrient free. Coco peat and sphagnum moss are preferred options. No fertiliser should be applied. Water used should be devoid of dissolved solids or minerals. Experienced growers even create new varieties by crossing breeds through manual pollination, but it is not easy.

“Female plants are few when compared to their male counterparts and you can only differentiate them when they flower. However, flowering doesn’t happen often, and the flowers are so small that you have to use a paint brush to handle the pollen,” says Wilson.

There are varieties that require cold winters to enter dormancy stage. “Many people buy Venus fly trap because they are enamoured by its trapping mechanism. But they don’t realise that it is not a tropical plant and requires at least a month of harsh winter,” says Shiva. Creating artificial conditions, then, is the solution. While certain collectors have their own incubators, keeping them in the fridge (for at least two months) is another option.

However, the tedious process involved in nurturing the plant has not affected its demand. For instance, Lakshmi Ashok Kumar, facilitator with a learning community in Kochi, cultivated Utricularia in the small pond at her home without knowing what it was. “Now I look forward to collecting more varieties and studying about the species,” she says.

And once you get hooked, you tend to become greedy. Partha and Nirmal look forward to adding the Australian pitcher plant to their collection, even though they are expensive and need extremely cold conditions to thrive. Shiva hopes to have Pygmy drocera, which sprout and live only during winter, and a hybrid variety that has pitchers huge enough to place one’s foot till the knee!

“For me, having a carnivorous plant is the closest I can get to owning a pet,” says Prajay, adding “Since these plants are rare and some are getting extinct, having them gives me a sense of satisfaction.”

Landmark discovery

In 2013, a group of scientists of Phytochemistry and Phytopharmacology division of the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute in Thiruvananthapuram (JNTBGRI) discovered blue fluorescence emissions in the traps of Nepenthes, Sarracenia and Venus flytrap to lure the prey. The glow is invisible to human eye. Carnivorous plants are a star attraction at the Institute.

“We get enquiries from hobbyists and a lot of visitors to see our collection. We have 27 species that fall into eight genus. Among them are three Nepenthes hybrids that we have developed,” says Saleem M, technical officer, Orchid Biology and Carnivorous Plant Unit, JNTBGRI.

359,2020/10/07,"English medium education to help poor, marginalised students, AP tells SC","The Andhra Pradesh government has told the Supreme Court that providing education through English medium would help the poor and marginalised students and bring better opportunities for career growth.

The State government told a Bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde that the Andhra Pradesh High Court order, which stayed the implementation of such plan for government-run Telugu medium schools, would limit the prospects of the students hailing from weaker strata of society.

Senior advocate K.V. Viswanathan, appearing for the state government, told the apex court that the most formative years of a child requires medium of instruction to be in English so that no “islands of exclusion” are created.

He said the government had said that it would set up Telugu schools at Mandal headquarter levels with transport facilities to help those students who wanted to study in their native language.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted before the Bench, also comprising Justices A.S. Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, that those who have studied in the vernacular medium are in ‘islands of isolation’ is a bit “uncharitable.”

The top court has now posted the matter for hearing in next week.

In April this year, the high court had set aside the order for government schools to convert the medium of instruction from Telugu to English.

Mr. Vishwanathan had earlier said a majority of parents wanted English to be the medium of education and it was a progressive, forward-looking measure in accordance with the Constitution.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-assembly/english-medium-education-to-help-poor-marginalised-students-ap-tells-sc/article32790941.ece

362,2020/10/07,New fish market becomes functional,"Photo: M.Srinath

TIRUCHI: The new fish market at Kasivilangai on the outskirts of Tiruchi was opened to the people without much fanfare on Wednesday.

Although no formal function marked the inauguration, senior officials of Tiruchi City Corporation and the traders, who were allotted shops, visited the market in the morning. A section of traders moved their equipment such as refrigerators, weigh machines, ice boxes and others from the Puthur fish market, which is to be demolished to pave the way for the construction of a shopping complex in a few days.

Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that the new market had become operational since Wednesday. All traders, who had got permanent shops at the Puthur market, had been allotted shops at the Kasivilangai market. Some of them had begun trade. A few others were in the process of moving. Full fledged trading activities would begin in a day or two.

He said the new market constructed at an estimate of ₹3.32 crore had 9 shops for the wholesale traders and 24 shops for the retailers. All necessary infrastructure for loading and unloading fish consignments had been provided in the new market. The market has been constructed on 1.5 acre site.

Retail shops have been built on a 6,905 square feet area, the wholesale outlets occupy the remaining area. A restroom for traders and customers and parking lots for two wheelers and four wheelers are part of the market complex. Space has been earmarked for installation of an ATM kiosk.Mr. Sivasubramanian said that the market had been designed for serving the people for at least 25 years.

Meanwhile, another senior official, who held a meeting with the traders at Puthur fish market ahead of shifting, told them to move to the new market with immediate effect. All vendors should vacate the outlets as early as possible. If they continued to trade at the old market, action would be taken against them. Moreover, lorries carrying fish consignment would be allowed to unload the consignment only at the new market.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/uiuzvx/article32796937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY08FISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/fish/article32796938.ece

364,2020/10/07,Srirangam temple gets second elephant,"Premi has been donated to the temple by Lakshmi Mills, Coimbatore

The Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam on Wednesday welcomed its second elephant, Premi.

Twenty-year-old Premi will soon join Andal, who is 42 and has been at the temple for over 30 years. Premi has been donated to the temple by Lakshmi Mills, Coimbatore and was set to reach the temple even before the lockdown was imposed in view of the pandemic, P. Jayaraman, Joint Commissioner, Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, told The Hindu. The second elephant was accepted as a donation because of the number of temple activities.

The temple authorities began preparations for an additional shed, next to Andal’s, nearly a year ago, a temple official said. “Her shed is the same as Andal’s and was constructed specially to accommodate her,” he said.

Premi arrived in Srirangam on Wednesday afternoon from Coimbatore. “She was to join us in March, but since the lockdown was in force, there was no transport available,” he added.

The elephant will undergo training at the temple premises for a period of at least six months before she joins Andal in temple events, the official said. “Even though she is already domesticated, she needs to get accustomed to the temple premises, her trainers and her role in the temple,” he said.

When Premi is ready, a schedule will be drawn up so that Andal and she take over temple duties on alternate days. “This will give them both rest and allow rituals and other events in the temple to run smoothly,” he said.

Until she is ready to take on her newly assigned duties, Premi will be on a diet of rice, cane jaggery and grass. She will be taken on walks and will be trained according to the temple needs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/7a2ix3/article32795543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SRIRANGAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/srirangam-temple-gets-second-elephant/article32795544.ece

Severe damage to groundnut crop in Anantapur district due to excess rainfall has raised concerns among agriculture scientists, farmers’ welfare bodies and farmers.

District Collector Gandham Chandrudu, taking into account these reports pouring in for the past fortnight, visited Ramapuram in Obulapuram Panchayat of Bathalapalli mandal to discern the ground reality of the crop, which has been failing for the majority number of years in the past three decades.

During his interaction with a farmer T. Ramanjaneyulu in the village, the Collector was told that against the normal yield of 10 to 12 bags, this year it has come down to five to six bags at the most due to the rot set in. A standard bag of groundnut is 40 kg and 5 bags translates to 240 kg per acre and 576 kg per hectare.

According to agriculture scientists, 700 kg per hectare was an economically viable crop yield. Mr. Chandrudu told farmers and farm labourers in the village, while sharing a cup of coffee with them, that he would get the fact verified on the groundnut crop and send a report to the State government if the yield was lower than the average.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/sm31tl/article32797775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08VJANNATPURGRPUNDNUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/report-groundnut-crop-damage-to-be-sent-to-govt/article32797776.ece

375,2020/10/07,Steps will be taken to revive coop. sugar factories: Minister,"Farmers urge Cabinet Sub-Committee members to create marketing facilities

Cabinet Sub-Committee comprising Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Botcha Satyanarayana, Agriculture Minister K. Kanna Babu, Industry Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy and Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao and MP Vanga Gita on Tuesday visited Thandava and Etikoppaka Cooperative Sugar Factories in the district and consulted the farmers on the steps needed to improve their functioning.

Mr. Goutham Reddy said there were 12 cooperative sugar factories in the State and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy asked them to take steps to benefit farmers.

Speaking to the farmers, Mr. Satyanarayana said that the YSRCP government was farmer-friendly and the Chief Minister would not deceive them like TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu had done. Mr. Kannababu assured the farmers that a report will be submitted to the Chief Minister soon. He said the State government will take steps to revive the 12 sick cooperative sugar factories. He said dues to the factories would also be cleared.

Funds to be released

The Agriculture Minister said that the Chief Minister was keen on revival of sugar factories and the government will give ₹9 crore for Thandava factory and ₹7 crore for Etikoppaka factory.

He urged the workers and farmers to strive to restore the past glory of the sugar factories.

The Agriculture Minister said that the crushing capacity had fallen as the past government did not make payments to farmers.

He said farmers should restore crop areas to support the factory. Mr. Goutham Reddy said the government was committed to protect the sugar units and necessary funds will be released for them.

The farmers urged the committee to create marketing facilities for sugar.

377,2020/10/07,Last month warmest September on record globally: EU Earth Observation Programme,"For the 12-month period through September, the planet was nearly 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Earth's surface was warmer last month than during any September on record, the European Union's Earth Observation Programme said Wednesday.

This year has now seen three months of record warmth — January, May and September — with June and April virtually tied for first, the Copernicus Climate Change Service reported.

“There is currently little difference between 2020 and 2016 for the year-to-date,” Copernicus senior scientist Freja Vambourg told AFP.

For the 12-month period through September, the planet was nearly 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. That is alarmingly close to the 1.5 degrees C threshold for severe impacts detailed in a major 2018 report by the UN's climate science advisory panel, the IPCC.

The Paris Agreement has enjoined nations to cap global warming at “well below” 2 degrees C, and 1.5 degrees C if feasible.

So far, Earth has warmed on average by one degree, enough to boost the intensity of deadly heatwaves, droughts and tropical storms made more destructive by rising seas. Climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels has picked up pace in recent decades.

Nineteen of the 20 last years are the warmest since accurate readings began in the late 19th century.

Since the late 1970s, the global thermometer has crept up 0.2 degrees C every decade, according to EU data.

Temperatures in September were “exceptionally high” over northern Siberia, which — along with much of the Arctic Circle — has seen freakishly warm weather for months.

September was brutal in the Middle East, with new high temperatures reported in Turkey, Israel and Jordan.

Fire and ice

Parts of North Africa and Tibet were also scorching hot, while maximum daytime values reached 49 degrees C in Los Angeles County early in the month.

Also Read UN, Britain say global climate summit set for December 12

Across California, five of the state's six biggest wildfires in history were still burning at the end of the month.

""September was warmer by 0.05 degrees C than September 2019, the previous warmest September,"" the Copernicus report said.

Last month's global record for heat was all the more remarkable because of the regional cooling effect of a naturally occurring La Nina weather event over the tropical Pacific.

Arctic sea ice, meanwhile, shrank to its second lowest extent last month, slipping below four million square kilometres for only the second time since satellite records began in 1978, according to C3S.

Climate change has also disrupted regional weather patterns, resulting in more sunshine beating down on the Greenland ice sheet, which is melting — and shedding mass into the ocean — more quickly than at any time in the last 12,000 years, according to a study published last week in Nature.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/rqydjx/article32790848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID-19MASKADVICEANDSUN,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/last-month-warmest-september-on-record-globally-eu-earth-observation-programme/article32790849.ece
378,2020/10/07,14 million tonnes of microplastics on sea floor: study,"Researchers at the agency, known as CSIRO, used a robotic submarine to collect samples from sites up to 3,000 metres deep, off the South Australian coast

The world's sea floor is littered with an estimated 14 million tonnes of microplastics, broken down from the masses of rubbish entering the oceans every year, according to Australia's national science agency.

The quantity of the tiny pollutants was 25 times greater than previous localised studies had shown, the agency said, calling it the first global estimate of sea-floor microplastics.

Researchers at the agency, known as CSIRO, used a robotic submarine to collect samples from sites up to 3,000 metres deep, off the South Australian coast.

“Our research found that the deep ocean is a sink for microplastics,” principal research scientist Denise Hardesty said. “We were surprised to observe high microplastic loads in such a remote location.”

The scientists, who published their findings in peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Marine Science, said areas with more floating rubbish generally had more microplastic fragments on the sea floor.

“Plastic pollution that ends up in the ocean deteriorates and breaks down, ending up as microplastics,” study lead Justine Barrett said. “The results show microplastics are indeed sinking to the ocean floor.”

Hardesty called for urgent action to find solutions to marine plastic pollution, which affects ecosystems, wildlife and human health. “Government, industry and the community need to work together to significantly reduce the amount of litter we see along our beaches and in our oceans,” she said.

379,2020/10/07,Manpreet and Reid want to return to full momentum gradually,"After training was severely affected by COVID-19 restrictions, the Indian men’s hockey team’s chief coach Graham Reid and skipper Manpreet Singh say it will be a deliberately slow progress towards the players attaining pre-lockdown fitness levels.

Six players of the men’s team, including Manpreet, had tested positive for COVID-19 at the team’s training base here in August after they arrived for the national camp following a month’s break.

“...we slowly started the procedures of getting back to play. The coaches have created a plan so that we gradually return to full momentum and I am happy to be back practising again,” Manpreet said in a release issued by Sports Authority of India (SAI).

Skills training

Reid said the emphasis is on skills training, especially individual basics, which allows the players to practice in small groups with adequate social distancing in place.

“...we have been able to gradually increase the workload and intensity of the training to the point where we are able to have the majority of the squad up to pre-COVID levels by the end of the next camp,” Reid added.

“This has been a slow and deliberate process designed to produce maximum output while minimising the risk of injury.”

The players are also happy with the safety protocols in place at SAI’s Bengaluru centre. “It feels good that we have started training after such a long time,” Rani Rampal said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/15b4j4/article32786263.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07MANPREET,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/manpreet-and-reid-want-to-return-to-full-momentum-gradually/article32786264.ece
380,2020/10/07,"Coronavirus | Unchecked, ‘immunity boosters’ can turn toxic","Unchecked, repeated use of ‘immunity boosting’ home remedies, prompted by the COVID-19 scare, can turn dangerous. Here’s a guide to deriving the most out of kitchen ingredients

“Yesterday my patient on the operating table bled buckets. He wasn’t on blood thinners — no explanations... After surgery, he told me he was taking a herbal concoction of ginger, garlic, turmeric and asafoetida thrice daily to prevent Covid.” A consultant at Manipal Hospitals and an ophthalmic surgeon, Dr Raghuraj Hegde’s viral tweet has started a conversation on natural ‘immunity boosters’. So far considered harmless, their copious use, especially by those who have comorbidities, has actually turned dangerous.

With COVID-19 causing panic and fear, suddenly our WhatsApp group chats are full of recipes for homemade kitchen concoctions — kashayams or kadhas — to ‘boost immunity’. The supplements market also boomed. Vitamin C and D flew off shelves, and advertisements for turmeric pills popped up on social media.

Fear of hospitals, combined with the reluctance to make digital appointments with doctors, kept people at home, self-medicating on ingredients they believed to be safe, and hoping for the best. An Indian wellness juice company, that claims to be ‘powered by Ayurveda’ says that in the past six months, one of its most popular products has been a ‘body defence drink’, which is a concoction of ashwagandha, amla, moringa, turmeric, gotu kola and coconut water. “We have seen a 300% growth in the past six months,” says a company representative.

Chennai resident, B Adhiban, 20, suffered an aggravation of his dormant ulcer last month. “I drank a long pepper concoction everyday for two weeks to prevent a cold. My mouth started burning, and my ulcer started acting up again.”

Doctors are worried. “During consultation, I get patients who try to get a prescription for zinc tablets, or vitamin C in the hope that these will protect them against COVID-19,” reveals Dr S Krishnamoorthy, senior consultant physician at Apollo Speciality Hospitals, Chennai. “And most of these are sold as health or herbal supplements, so they are not that regulated. Anybody can sell them over the counter.”

Dr P Mohanavel, MS, Villupuram Government Hospital points out the result of this kind of self-medication. “At least 15% of the patients we get are those that have overdosed on such concoctions. They are treated for stomach problems, and sometimes, in severe cases, an endoscopy is done.”

As much as our concern for immunity has risen, health practitioners remind us that there is no magic pill.

“The very concept of boosting immunity is wrong to start with. Your immunity is a reflection of your own health. It is not like we should be consciously working on our immune system; work on your overall health, specifically gut health, and your immunity will automatically improve,” says Delhi-based dietitian Manjari Chandra, adding that about 70% of our immunity depends on our gut health, “And then it is the environment, the state in which you eat.” Exercise, sleep, and hydration are other equally important cornerstones, adds Dr Krishnamoorthy.

The most abused OTC supplements Vitamin C. “Vitamin C supplements work better in ascorbate form than in ascorbic acid form, which is the most common type sold,” says Manjari Chandra.

Zinc, another popular supplement, in excess induces a deficiency in copper levels in the body and may also cause lethargy, according to a 2010 study, The Essential Toxin: Impact of Zinc on Human Health, published in Internation Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

Ayurvedic and herbal medicines such as ashwagandha, ‘kapasura kudineer’ and ‘nilavembu kashayam’ too see heavy demand OTC.

“I am not against herbal concoctions and natural remedies, but there is a dosage that must be followed,” says Dr Mohanvel. When eaten as a part of our meals (like turmeric in dal), it is good for us, also because the spice is used in balance, “But many people are taking one cup of such concoctions like coffee and tea in the morning and evening,” he adds.

Dietitian Preethi Raj gives us some pointers on popular home remedies, what each does, and how much is too much.

1. Turmeric

Curcumin is the active ingredient which is responsible for its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Freshly ground turmeric works better than store-bought powders, and should be consumed within three weeks. To maximise its benefit, have it with pepper. Cooking it in oil increases its bioavailability.

Stop if… you feel bloated or experience cramps. Eat no more than three grams (half a teaspoon) a day if taking in a concoction.

2. Ginger

The physiological action of ginger is due to gingerol. Fresh ginger helps maintain the health of the digestive tract by stabilising gut bacteria. Dried ginger detoxifies the lung. For optimal effect, have as ginger lime juice.

Stop if… you experience gastrointestinal discomfort. Eat no more than 10 ml (two teaspoons) of fresh ginger juice or four to five grams (one teaspoon) per day

3. Black pepper

The piperine in black pepper helps in lung detoxification and improves production of T-cells, that help fight infections. Apart from being anti-inflammatory, it also helps in the initial stages of phagocytosis (where cells engulf bacteria, which in turn helps strengthen immunity). It improves the absorption of curcumin and beta carotene, so it can be combined with Vitamin A rich foods, such as a carrot salad.

Stop if… you face gastrointestinal issues, mild acid increase or heart burns. Eat less than four grams of pepper kernels over a day.

4. Fenugreek

Fenugreek is anti-inflammatory, lowers blood sugar and cholesterol, thanks to its active ingredients, mainly flavonoids, which work as antioxidants, and alkaloids and coumarin, which have antiviral properties. Sprouted fenugreek has a lot of antioxidants and when taken on an empty stomach, its absorption will be maximum. It also goes well with fermented food like idli and dosa, as the fermentation process feeds the good bacteria in the gut. So use it in a curry to eat with these.

Stop if… you feel intestinal distress. Have less than five grams (one teaspoon) a day, as more may cause liver toxicity which could lead to a fatty liver or even cirrhosis.

5. Garlic

Allicin, disulphate and thiosulphate in garlic detoxify the lung from micro-organisms and oxidants, and induce good digestion for healthy adults. Best eaten with fish as the Omega-3-fatty acids in the latter, increasing the allicin component. Vegetarians can replace fish with flax seeds, like in the Bihari teesi ki chutney.

Stop if… you develop a bad odour in the mouth, feel bloated or weak in any way (it could be a sign of low blood pressure). Eat no more than seven grams a day (a teaspoon and a half at most) or 300 mg (a pinch) of dry garlic powder.

6. Cumin and coriander seeds

Best had together, cumin contains cuminaldehyde and phytochemicals that aid in gut motility (bowel movement). Being rich in minerals like selenium, calcium, magnesium and potassium, it helps build immunity. Cumin can also be had with salmon, and for vegetarians, with lentils and eggplant.

Be careful if… You have low blood pressure — do not exceed 600 mg of cumin and one gm (a few seeds) of coriander per day.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/pom4r9/article32793666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1249816798,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-immunity-boosters-can-turn-harmful/article32793667.ece
381,2020/10/07,Suicide has come home?,"We should start to listen, acknowledge, and simply asking the question: what can I do to change this reality, so no one is pushed to the edge?

Trigger warning: The following text is about suicide, which may be upsetting to some people.

When the lockdown began, and we were still getting used to working from home, a friend told me they were in a dark space. “Did I ever tell you,” they said, “that I once attempted suicide?”

Journalists are trained to listen, and so I did, to a successful writer who engages with the world readily, whose eyes come alive when they speak, who is always enthusiastic, loves the family dearly, and will go out of their way to get a quality kebab.

I will not give you the details of their attempt, because we’re not supposed to, under World Health Organization’s guidelines on writing about suicide, lest it sets off copycat suicides in people. For many of us, suicide may be restricted to a thought, a habit to lapse into, to fantasise about, each time a situation is too difficult to find a solution to. And therein lies the problem. From the time we are very young, we are told to find solutions. Our society is solution-driven, like somehow if you don’t find one there is something wrong with you. The maths problem, the financial situation, the alcohol addiction — they all needed solutions, often with minimal support and little empathy.

Suicide does not have a single cause — it is not about a girlfriend swindling you of some money, or a friend supplying you with drugs, or even a mental health condition alone. Sure, the careful contemplation of someone with depression, or the impulsive decision of someone with a personality disorder may be the ultimate cause of a person taking their life, but it is really an erosion of resilience over a long period, of not being heard, of a deep sense of loneliness.

Suicide is about you, me, our parents, children, teachers, governments, neighbours, friends, schools and colleges, workplaces, religious and financial institutions — the systems and relationships on which we build our lives. It is not about ‘fixing’ anything. It is about listening, acknowledging, and simply asking the question: what can I do to change this reality, so no one is pushed to the edge? It is not about saying, “Oh but he was always smiling.” Because people — even those who contemplate suicide —have moments where they enjoy life, and many more where they wear masks. It is about offering a friendly ear of course, but equally about acknowledging that each of us is a part of the problem. India, we have been told repeatedly, is a collectivist society, always offering support. It’s time to live out our claims. Then, the ‘solution’ will take care of itself.
