0,2020/10/22,Woods eyes record 83rd USPGA title,"Defends title at Zozo championship

Tiger Woods has improved his game since missing the cut at last month's US Open, and is defending his title at the Zozo Championship with an eye on next month's Masters.

The 44-year-old former World No. 1 is trying for an unprecedented 83rd career US PGA title at Sherwood Country Club, where Woods once hosted his Hero World Challenge charity event.

Improvement

“My game is definitely better than it was at the US Open,” Woods said. “I feel a little bit more prepared, a little bit better, and hopefully that translates into playing the golf course.”

Woods won his 82nd career Tour title last October in Japan at the Zozo, matching Sam Snead for the all-time record, but the event was moved to California this year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, giving Woods a chance to repeat as champion on a different but familiar layout.

“I think that having it here and having Zozo come to America and have it come to this venue in particular is fantastic for all of us,” Woods said. “The fact we're able to have this championship, it was a big thing for the Tour and a big bonus. It's awesome for us to be able to come back here to Sherwood. It's a golf course I know well.”

As well as defending his crown, Woods is using the event as a tune-up for the Masters, which was moved from April to November due to the virus outbreak.

Woods said he might play the Houston Open the week before the Masters.

Play and practise

“My plan is just to play and practise. This entire year has been different for all of us. My run-up to Augusta is unlike anything I've ever experienced. That's just the way it is. The whole idea is to be ready in a few weeks and whether or not that's playing one more event or just playing here at Zozo, just making sure that I'm ready for Augusta,” he said.

Woods has, meanwhile, called off this year's World Challenge, planned for December in the Bahamas.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/c0657a/article32921046.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23WOODS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/woods-eyes-record-83rd-uspga-title/article32921047.ece
1,2020/10/22,National camp starts after quarantine period ends,"Shooters, coaches and staff were tested twice for COVID-19

The National camp for the Olympic core group shooters started at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, on Thursday, after stringent adherence to safety protocols.

The shooters, coaches and other support staff had been tested for COVID-19 when they reported for the camp, and quarantined in a hotel for a week, before a second test cleared them for training at the range.

“We did zoom sessions for fitness training during the quarantine period,” said Deepali Deshpande, the high performance coach for rifle.

Meanwhile, the high performance coach for pistol, Delhi-based Samaresh Jung said that he had finished the formalities of home isolation and testing, and would be joining training on Friday.

Most of the shooters reported for the camp.

There were rare exceptions like Asian skeet champion Angad Vir Singh Bajwa who continues to train at his home range in Chandigarh, as he has to take care of his grandparents.

Guidance

In the absence of national coach Ennio Falco, who trains the skeet shooters, Angad said that he was following the guidance of his coach Tore Brovold for training routine at home.

For the other Olympic quota holder in skeet, Mairaj Ahmad Khan, nothing much has changed as he has been training at the range, ever since it opened for training, long before the camp.

“I hope Falco joins soon,” said Mairaj, who also got tested so as to follow the protocol.

“For me, nothing much has changed, as I have been regularly training at the range,” said Mairaj.

Saurabh Chaudhary and Manu Bhaker also had their home quarantine before joining the camp, as there was an option for those living in Delhi NCR to be in “home isolation”.

There will be a break for a week for Deepavali, before the shooters assemble once again for training and continue till December 17.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/yf1wgf/article32920965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23SHOOT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/national-camp-starts-after-quarantine-period-ends/article32920966.ece
2,2020/10/22,Lack of competition not ideal but Bajrang won’t mind going straight into World Championship,"The United World Wrestling cancelled the junior worlds but is hopeful that senior championships will be held in Belgrade, Serbia from December 12-20 despite rising COVID-19 cases in Europe.

Not getting any competition before the World Championships is not ideal but India’s top wrestler Bajrang Punia says neither is lining up for any or every event amid a raging pandemic and he would rather go straight to the big event, albeit a bit short on match practice.

The United World Wrestling cancelled the junior worlds but is hopeful that senior championships will be held in Belgrade, Serbia from December 12-20 despite rising COVID-19 cases in Europe.

The Indians are currently training at the Sports Authority of India’s (SAI) Sonepat centre.

“It is very good that we are back at training. It isn’t that we were out of rhythm because we were training at our homes during the lockdown. But that cannot be compared to what one can do at the camp when we train on mat,” Bajrang said in a SAI release.

The men’s camp began at the SAI centre from September 1.

”...but we will only know our level and where we stand when we compete. A player needs to play otherwise they will never know where they stand,” Bajrang acknowledged.

There are two men’s freestyle international events scheduled in Poland (November 4-8) and Russia (November 7-8) but Bajrang told PTI that they are not keen to compete there.

“At these events, any number of wrestlers can come but at the Worlds only one wrestler in each category will be there, so I don’t think it’s prudent to travel to either Russia or Poland,” the 65kg category wrestler said.

“We are not sure if even the Worlds will be held. We are hearing that fresh coronavirus cases are increasing in Europe.”

It means that if, at all, the world championship is held, wresters will jump into the biggest event on the UWW calendar straight from training without any prior competition.

“So what, we have to start from somewhere and since everyone is sailing in the same boat, it is ok. Olympics is the target,” said Bajrang, one of the three men’s freestyle wrestlers from the country to qualify for the Tokyo Games.

National coach Jagmander Singh also said getting to competition is important.

“From the time training restarted to now, the wrestlers have improved considerably...The true test of where the wrestlers stand will only come when they participate in competitions,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/jihlya/article32919369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BAJRANGPUNIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/lack-of-competition-not-ideal-but-bajrang-wont-mind-going-straight-into-world-championship/article32919370.ece
3,2020/10/22,Ritu ready with ‘shock’ tactics,"Takes on Cambodian Nou Srey Pov in an MMA bout

With two easy wins in as many bouts in her MMA career so far, Ritu Phogat will be looking to step up her game when she takes on Cambodian Nou Srey Pov on October 30 in Singapore.

Training well

The One: Inside the Matrix challenge would be the first for Ritu in eight months. And, while her wrestling pedigree has helped her so far, Ritu says she has been working on other aspects as well, including striking, something her opponent is an expert at.

“Wrestling has formed the bedrock of a lot of my efforts in MMA but I have been working on perfecting a lot of other techniques. Initially, I had a lot of trouble with striking and jujitsu, but I have improved,” Ritu said during a virtual interaction.

Unwilling to reveal further, she simply said her opponent was “an experienced MMA champion” and that it would be “an interesting fight” but added that Pov would be ‘shocked’ with her different strategy for the fight.

Admitting that combat sport in an empty stadium would be a challenge, Ritu insisted she was ready for the experience.

“No audience will definitely feel different as crowds can provide motivation. But when I step into the ring, my sole focus is my opponent. Besides, an empty stadium means you can hear your coach guiding you,” she reasoned.

Inspiration

The Indian draws inspiration from Russian MMA champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, boasting of an incredible 28-0 record, and Virat Kohli.

“His (Khabib’s) control on the ground is immense, I hope to fight like him and watch his videos to learn more. Virat Kohli is also really inspiring, I like watching his training videos,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/8gjqfs/article32918400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23RITU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ritu-ready-with-shock-tactics/article32918401.ece

5,2020/10/22,TTFI’s National camp from Oct. 28,"Sharath Kamal says its a welcome move

The Table Tennis Federation of India’s (TTFI) National camp — postponed multiple times due to circumstances beyond its control — will finally begin on October 28 at Sonepat (Haryana).

In an e-mail on Wednesday addressed to some of the top players, TTFI said: “SAI has now agreed for the camp beginning October 28 at DPS School, Sonepat, with the condition that all players must report on the same date (Oct. 28).

“Since you all had given your consent we will be asking SAI to issue tickets for your travel to Delhi on the said date.”

Speaking to The Hindu on Tuesday, M.P. Singh, secretary TTFI, said: “We are very much eager to start. It will be good practice for the Olympic qualification scheduled to begin next year. G. Sathiyan and Harmeet Desai can join the camp when they return from their respective European leagues.

“Earlier the camp was for 15 days with a short break followed by another 15 days. Now SAI and TTFI have decided that it will be for 35 days. If the players agree to it, we can plan accordingly.”

India’s top paddler Sharath Kamal said it’s a good start. “All of us have been looking for good practice partners and it is great that we all will be coming under one roof.”

However, Sharath wondered on the possibility of players getting stale if the TTFI sticks to its plan of a long camp of 35 days.

“If it is a long camp with just four players, it will get stale. We have to keep bringing in new players keeping the [bio] bubble in mind.”

The National camp players: Men: Sharath Kamal, Manav Thakkar, Manush Shah, Sudhanshu Grover and Jubin Kumar.

Women: Archana Kamath, Sutirtha Mukherjee, Takeme Sarkar and Anusha Kutumbale.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/mquh4u/article32912234.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22KAMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ttfis-national-camp-from-oct-28/article32912235.ece
6,2020/10/22,"U.S. pharma giant suffers data breach, exposes private data of drug users","The exposed data was related to conversations between Pfizer’s automated customer support software and people using its prescription drugs.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

The U.S. pharma company Pfizer mistakenly leaked private data of the country’s prescription drug users in a data breach caused due to unsecured cloud storage, according to cybersecurity firm vpnMentor.

The exposed data was related to conversations between Pfizer’s automated customer support software and people using its prescription drugs.

“By not protecting this data, Pfizer compromised the privacy and security of people using its medications, many of them already vulnerable due to poor health,” vpnMentor said in a blog post.

It added that Pfizer initially denied the importance of data and after vpnMentor sent a file with a sample of their customers’ personal identifiable information, the pharma giant secured the bucket and never replied to vpnMentor’s messages.

The folder that contained transcripts of conversations between drug users and company’s customer support software was named ‘escalations’. The company’s investigation showed that there were hundreds of transcripts while more were being uploaded.

Each transcript had personal data such as full names, address, phone number, and details of health and medical status. In addition to this, transcripts carried information related to products manufactured and sold by Pfizer, including many medicines used to treat various forms of cancer.

The cybersecurity firm also posted screenshots of the data and conversations exposed in its blog.

It cannot be known whether cybercriminals gained access to the data, but the sensitive information could be used to target those exposed with highly effective phishing campaigns such as fake prescription refills and identify fraud.

vpnMentor noted that while Pfizer isn’t liable under US laws that how dictate healthcare companies manage customer data, it still broke plenty of rules and best practices for handling sensitive medical data in the US.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/1rs6o2/article32918941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/pfizerjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/us-pharma-giant-suffers-data-breach-exposes-private-data-of-drug-users/article32918868.ece
7,2020/10/22,Facebook tops attackers’ list for cyber frauds,"Facebook was leveraged with 4.5 million phishing attempts between April and September this year, as per Kaspersky’s analysis.

Facebook has been at the top of the list of cybercriminals for launching a cyberattack to steal personal information, according to a report by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.

Facebook was leveraged with 4.5 million phishing attempts between April and September this year, as per Kaspersky’s analysis. It was followed by Whatsapp and Amazon with 3.7 million and 3.3 million respectively.

While Google’s offering including YouTube, Gmail and Google Drive held sixth position with 1.5 million phishing attempts.

“These results only confirm the trend that popular applications have become valuable platforms for fraudsters’ malicious attacks,” Kaspersky said in a report.

Web services that employees of small and medium businesses most frequently access while working are some of the most exploited by malefactors as they are used as a springboard for phishing, it added.

The statistics also points out at what web applications are likely to be limited on organisations’ corporate devices. As noted by Kaspersky, the top five most blocked applications only include social networks- Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and LinkedIn.

While the organisations bar Facebook, they don’t include messengers, file sharing or mail services in their list of applications that cannot be used by employees due to their work purpose needs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/nh5yoe/article32918931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/facebook-phishing-attackjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-tops-attackers-list-for-cyber-frauds/article32918822.ece
8,2020/10/22,Google’s antitrust case could benefit Microsoft’s Bing search engine,"From at least 2007 through 2015, Microsoft lobbied lawmakers, funded private lawsuits, commissioned opposition research and academic papers and even ran TV commercials, all with the aim of getting regulators to bar what it viewed as anticompetitive practices by Google.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

The U.S. government's antitrust suit against Alphabet Inc's Google on Tuesday could deliver a huge opportunity for Microsoft Corp to increase usage of its Bing search engine, an unexpected epilogue years after it abandoned a long campaign for legal relief.

From at least 2007 through 2015, Microsoft lobbied lawmakers, funded private lawsuits, commissioned opposition research and academic papers and even ran TV commercials, all with the aim of getting regulators to bar what it viewed as anticompetitive practices by Google.

Codenamed “Appendix A” inside Microsoft, the campaign failed to change Google's behavior or boost Bing's market share, according to current and former Microsoft officials involved in the effort. Satya Nadella killed Appendix A by cutting funding and staff when he took over as chief executive in 2015, the sources said.

Yet, the concerns once expressed by Microsoft underlie the Justice Department's new case.

Google cornered the web search and search ads markets by paying billions of dollars to smartphone makers, wireless carriers and browser makers to promote its search engine and penalizing them for showcasing rivals, the government alleges.

Google denied the claims in the lawsuit and called it ”deeply flawed.”

The complaint quotes a Google executive as saying without the “really important” penalties, Bing could have stolen away the widespread promotion Google enjoyed. Another Google staffer is quoted as noting Google's promotional deals with browsers are ”a good way to keep [a browser] away from Bing.”

About 80% of U.S. web searches go through distribution points that Google now owns or controls, leaving Bing with about 7% of the market as the closest competitor, the lawsuit says.

Though Google said it is prepared to fight the lawsuit for years, the filing of the complaint is likely to motivate its search engine rivals to newly invest in improving their technology and challenging Google's various restrictions to gain greater distribution, technology and legal experts said.

And if Microsoft's response to a government antitrust lawsuit twenty years ago is any guide, Google may move more cautiously against rivals while the case plays out.

“Markets work better when firms know there is a sheriff in town,” said Chris Sagers, law professor at Cleveland State University.

Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former Google executive who now runs Neeva, which is developing a paid, privacy-focused search engine, said that “we hope the DOJ's actions will create a more equal playing field for search apps like Neeva that want to create real options for customers.”

Microsoft declined to comment for this story. It has answered questions about Google from investigators in several countries over the last two years, according to public records, but has not been proactively bashing Google, two academics and two attorneys once retained for anti-Google work said.

APPENDIX A

The Appendix A effort dated back to Microsoft's frustration with Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, or less than what Microsoft had offered, one source said.

Then-CEO Steve Ballmer organized a handful of people to understand Google's strategy and fight the deal, which regulators approved over Microsoft's objections.

The codename, according to sources, referred to the section within a paper written by Google's co-founders in which they said “advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.”

Microsoft tried to make a case to regulators and the public that Google hurt consumers by blocking them from alternatives and instead ironically providing low-quality search results because they were packed with ads.

Microsoft funded and managed anti-Google groups including FairSearch and Icomp, bringing on board other Google foes including Expedia Group Inc, Yelp Inc, News Corp and Oracle Corp, sources said.

Microsoft-backed websites, such as SafeCloud.org, promoted articles raising concerns about the security of Google cloud services, one source said. One Microsoft staffer focused on bonding with small business aggrieved by Google, two other sources said, with some of the operations subsisting off Microsoft funding.

Political campaign strategist Mark Penn later joined in 2012 to produce the widely viewed “Scroogled” advertising campaign that criticized Google's privacy practices and its ad-heavy product searches.

But when Nadella took Microsoft's reins, he expressed concern that fighting the industry darling that was Google had hurt his company's ability to hire, partner and attract new business, according to sources involved in the discussions. Nadella decommissioned the Appendix A team, cleared the air with Google, and began using Google-owned software to power Microsoft's internet browser and some mobile devices.

Bing's ad salespeople are among those inside that have agitated to renew anti-Google lobbying, sources said.

Meanwhile, Oracle and those other Google critics picked up where Microsoft left off, and have focused over the last five years on Google's control over advertising technology used by publishers - a subject mostly left out of Tuesday's complaint.

The Justice Department could introduce allegations related to Google's advertising technology as soon as next month, again benefitting Microsoft, according to sources briefed on the investigation.

Democracies around the world are under a constant barrage of cyberattacks that must be identified, called out and stopped, Microsoft President Brad Smith told a gathering of security and defence officials on Wednesday.

Speaking at the Atlantic Future Forum, Smith named Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as the states most frequently engaged in malicious cyberattacks targeting elections and the domestic politics of other countries.

“We're living in this period of time that is certainly not necessarily war but doesn't feel entirely like peace either,” he said. “It's this grey zone where we see these constant cyberattacks.

“Five years ago, I think we thought about this principally in terms of attacks on, say, conventional infrastructure or our military capabilities, but today I think it's just become an onslaught on democracy itself.”

U.S. officials have warned that countries including Russia and Iran are tryting to sway the outcome of the Nov. 3 presidential election. Moscow and Tehran have repeatedly denied such accusations.

Smith said the “hacking and weaponising” of private emails and disinformation campaigns posed the greatest threats. “I do believe it's one of the greatest risks to the protection of our democracies today.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/jfys1z/article32917681.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/brad-smithjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/global-democracy-at-risk-from-cyberattack-onslaught-microsoft-president/article32917661.ece

Reliance Jio has launched new, revamped `JioPages’, its Made-in-India mobile browser that is available in eight Indian languages and promises enhanced browsing experience while focusing on data privacy.

The new version of the browser made its debut on Google Playstore on Tuesday.

JioPages is built on the Chromium Blink engine, and provides enhanced browsing experience through faster engine migration, webpage rendering, faster page loads, efficient media streaming, Emoji domain support and encrypted connection, company sources told PTI.

A Jio spokesperson confirmed the launch but did not offer details.

Sources, meanwhile, said the previous version had seen over 14 million downloads and all those users would be upgraded to the latest version in a phased manner.

Conceptualised and designed entirely in India, JioPages supports eight Indian languages - Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Bengali, besides English.

Users will have the choice of customising the content feed according to their preferred state.

On selecting a state, the local popular sites start appearing on the screen, the source added.

Amid concerns on web security and data protection, the browser focuses on data-privacy and offers users full control of their information, the source said.

The key features include a personalised home screen, where users have the option of setting any of the leading search engines such as Google, Bing, MSN, Yahoo and others as the default search engine. For quick and easy access, the user can also pin the links of their favourite websites on the home screen.

Other features are choice of personalised theme (including an option to switch to ‘dark mode’ for an eye-friendly viewing experience at night), and personalised content, with content-feed, customised to suit the user’s preference in terms of language, topic and region.

An `Informative Card’ captures key numbers, trends, symbols or headlines of a given topic, say, stock market trends, commodity prices or cricket score, and displays them as compact clickable banners on the screen, the source pointed out.

Besides this, on JioPages, users have the option of setting a four-digit security PIN or fingerprint as an access code to the `incognito mode’.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ljtxun/article32916644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/jio-reutersjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/jio-unveils-new-upgraded-jiopages-made-in-india-mobile-browser-supports-8-indian-languages/article32916641.ece
11,2020/10/22,Google's navigation software let hackers track and identify users,"Security DevOps engineer Peter Gasper discovered a flaw in the API that lets hackers track movements of drivers and identify the users.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

A security researcher found a vulnerability in Google’s Waze, a GPS navigation software, that can allow hackers to track and identify users by their location.

Security DevOps engineer Peter Gasper discovered a flaw in the API that lets hackers track movements of drivers and identify the users.

“I have reported findings via Google vulnerability programme,” Gasper told The Hindu. “I described possible attack scenarios and they confirmed it as a valid issue.”

He added that the issue seems to be fixed now. However, Google has not responded to an email query at the time of publishing this story.

Gasper reported the bug to Google in December last year and received a bug bounty of $1,337 in January 2020, he revealed in a blog post.

“Based on a reward size I think they consider it as a ‘potential’ misuse or possible vulnerability without any active harm done,” Gasper said.

Waze is used by drivers all around the world to share real-time information on traffic, accidents, and blocked roads by simply keeping the app open. Users should have an active data connection to use the service. The app was created for private cars so currently it doesn’t support navigating in lanes dedicated to public transportation, bicycles or trucks.

Gasper’s research iinto Waze began when he found that he could visit Waze from any web browser at waze.com/livemap and decided to check how driver icons are implemented. He noticed that Waze API can give data on a location by sending the location’s coordinates. Additionally, it also sends coordinates of other drivers who are nearby.

To Gasper’s surprise, the identification numbers (ID) associated with the icons were not changing over time, so he decided to track one driver and after some time she appeared in a different place on the same road.

He continued his research to find out a way to translate ID to a username or vice versa. He had success when he found out that if a user acknowledges any road obstacle or reported police patrol, user ID together with the username is returned by the Waze API to any Wazer driving through the place.

“The application usually doesn’t show this data unless there is an explicit comment created by the user, but the API response contains the username, ID, location of an event and even a time when it was acknowledged,” Gasper said in his blog post.

He explained that attacker can pick multiple locations with high traffic and periodically call API and crawl the users that confirmed the existence of an obstacle. As many people use their legitimate names as usernames, an attacker can build a dictionary of user names and their IDs. They can also store all the icon locations and correlate them with the user.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ccwzor/article32916833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/google-wazejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/googles-navigation-software-let-hackers-track-and-identify-users/article32916640.ece
12,2020/10/22,India’s mobile revolution turns 25: tracking the high and low points,"The sector continued to see steady growth until Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani entered the the industry with his Reliance Jio offering in 2016. A move that disrupted the existing order.

India’s mobile connectivity traces back to July 31, 1995 when the then West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu made the first mobile call to Sukh Ram, the then Union communications minister, using a Nokia Phone.

“25 years ago, when the Indian telecom sector was liberalized and players, including Airtel emerged on the scene, no one had imagined we would come this far,” said Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman of Bharti Airtel in a report.

Back then, Indian consumers had to wait for months to get a landline connection. Today, in just a few hours, a consumer can buy a mobile and activate connection, allowing them to connect with people across the world instantly.

In the last two and half decades, mobile phones, too, have moved categories, from a luxury gadget for the rich to a ‘must-have’ device for all people. The gradual drop in voice calling rates and handset cost have accelerated mobile adoption across sections of the society.

During this period, mobile tariffs saw a significant drop. Today, consumers enjoy free phone call, which used to cost Rs. 18 per minute 25 years ago.

Licensing and mobile technology

In 1994, India gave license to private telecom players and allowed them to access the market. This move led to a mobile revolution - - one which made operators suffer heavy losses as they paid about Rs 27,000 crore for license. The government later changed the fixed-license fee to a revenue-sharing system to support the operators.

In 2002, Tata Teleservices, Reliance Communications Limited and Hutchison operated on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) based network, a second-generation telecom standard. They introduced CDMA to reach out to the low-budget sections.

In 2004, when incoming calls were made free. Also, for the first time, the number of mobile phone users in India surpassed the number of landline users.

Three years later, the number of mobile users jumped to more than 5 times to 233 million, according to data from Cellular operators association of India (COAI).

Due to an increase in FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) cap to 74%, from 49%, the sector gained more financial clout that helped boost development in mobile technology and connectivity.

In 2009, Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC launched their first smartphone in India, priced at about Rs 30,000. This was followed by the entry of Chinese brands in 2014 that sold cheaper handsets to Indian consumers. The Chinese brands became more popular than homegrown brands like Micromax, Intex and Lava.

At the other end of the spectrum, Apple and Samsung were selling handsets for people looking for premium gadgets.

Enter Jio

The sector continued to see steady growth until Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani entered the the industry with his Reliance Jio offering in 2016. A move that disrupted the existing order.

Jio gave its subscribers free voice calls, and data at extremely low rates. In an attempt to play catch up, rivals spent a lot and compromised their margins.

Mobile operators like Aircel, Telenor had to shut shop, leaving only 3 players in the industry - - Jio, Airtel and Vodafone. Jio today is the largest mobile network operator in India, followed by Airtel and Vodafone.

Reliance’s dominance in India’s telecom industry today is linked to its acquisition of Infotel Broadbad Services just few hours after the company won 4G auction.

The small internet service provider won a slot and 4G spectrum in each of India’s 22 telecom circles. The bid amount was several times the net worth of Infotel.

At the time of auction, the spectrum was supposed to be used for data services only. However, the rules were later changed to allow voice services on the same spectrum.

Legal woes

The already squeezed operators were told by the Supreme Court to pay their Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues for he last 10 years. This situation could stifle competition in the sector, which is currently ruled Jio and Airtel. Vodafone stated that it was not in a position to pay the dues.

Telecom operators are supposed to share a percentage of AGR with the government, as a part of the ‘revenue-sharing fee’ model that was adopted from ‘fixed license fee’.

The government intervened and formally submitted to the Supreme Court to stagger the AGR payment dues over 20 years. This could significantly ease burden on a few operations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/860qbc/article32916175.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MobileNetworkConnectivity,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/indias-mobile-revolution-turns-25-tracking-the-high-and-low-points/article32916145.ece
13,2020/10/22,Microsoft to take Azure to space to enable cloud services in remote locations,"The new connectivity will help bring valuable customer data from geosynchronous orbit (GEO) satellites directly into Azure, Microsoft said.

Microsoft is launching Azure Space to help deal with the vast amount of data generated from satellites, bring cloud services and bandwidth to remote locations, and design highly complex space systems.

“We will extend the utility of our Azure capabilities with worldwide satellite connectivity, unblock cloud computing in more scenarios, and empower our partners and customers to achieve more,” said Tom Keane, Corporate Vice President, Azure Global.

The new connectivity will help bring valuable customer data from geosynchronous orbit (GEO) satellites directly into Azure, Microsoft said.

Microsoft also revealed the Azure Orbital Emulator to enable testing satellite constellation operations in simulation, using both software and hardware. This will allow satellite developers to evaluate and train AI algorithms and satellite networking before ever launching a single satellite, it said.

The US-based company aims to make space connectivity attainable across industries like agriculture, energy, telecommunications, and government, with the new initiative.

The company partnered with SpaceX Starlink to provide high-speed, low-latency satellite broadband for the new Azure Modular Datacenter (MDC), a container-based data center unit that can be deployed in remote locations.

Microsoft said that it designed the MDC to support high-intensity, secure cloud computing in challenging environments where power and building infrastructure are unreliable. The MDC can run on low-bandwidth networks, or be completely disconnected that helps to deploy them in even remote locations.

The MDC can also give Microsoft’s customers a way to migrate apps to Azure.

Microsoft said that its offerings can help mobile command centres, military mission needs, mineral exploration, and other areas that require high intensity and secure computing on Azure.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/jaruvu/article32915715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MicrosoftAzureSpace,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microsoft-to-take-azure-to-space-to-enable-cloud-services-in-remote-locations/article32915656.ece
14,2020/10/22,PayPal to open up network to cryptocurrencies,"U.S. account holders will be able to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in their PayPal wallets over the coming weeks, the company said.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

PayPal Holdings Inc said on Wednesday it will allow customers to hold bitcoin and other virtual coins in its online wallet and shop using cryptocurrencies at the 26 million merchants on its network.

The new service makes PayPal one of the largest U.S. companies to provide consumers access to cryptocurrencies, which could help bitcoin and rival cryptocurrencies gain wider adoption as viable payment methods.

The San Jose, California-based company hopes the service will encourage global use of virtual coins and prepare its network for new digital currencies that central banks and companies may develop, President and Chief Executive Dan Schulman said in an interview.

“We are working with central banks and thinking of all forms of digital currencies and how PayPal can play a role,” he said.

U.S. account holders will be able to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in their PayPal wallets over the coming weeks, the company said. PayPal plans to expand the service to its peer-to-peer payment app Venmo and some other countries in the first half of 2021.

The ability to make payments with cryptocurrencies will be available from early next year, the company said.

Other mainstream fintech companies, such as mobile payments provider Square Inc and stock trading app firm Robinhood Markets Inc, allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but PayPal's launch is noteworthy given its size.

The company has 346 million active accounts around the world and processed $222 billion in payments in the second quarter.

PayPal's shares were up 4% at 1418 GMT, set for their best day in a month.

Bitcoin hit its highest since July 2019 on the news. It was last up 4.8% at $12,494, taking gains for the original and biggest cryptocurrency above 75% for the year.

Cryptocurrency market players said the size of PayPal meant the move would be a plus for bitcoin prices.

“The price impact will be positive overall,” Joseph Edwards of Enigma Securities, a cryptocurrency brokerage in London, said.

“There's no comparison with regards to the potential exposure between the upside of PayPal offering this, and the upside of any similar previous offering.”

Bitcoin and other virtual coins have struggled to become established as widely used forms of payment despite being around for more than a decade. Cryptocurrencies' volatility is attractive for speculators, but poses risks for merchants and shoppers. Transactions are also slower and more costly than other mainstream payment systems.

PayPal believes its new system will address these issues as payments will be settled using traditional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. This means PayPal will be managing the risk of price fluctuations and merchants will receive payments in virtual coins.

“We are going about it in a fundamentally different way to make sure we provide the maximum amount of safety to our merchants,” Schulman said.

PayPal's service comes as some central banks have announced plans to develop digital versions of their currencies, following a Facebook-led cryptocurrency project Libra in 2019, which was met by strong regulatory pushback..

PayPal was among the founding members of this project but dropped out after a few months.

PayPal has secured the first conditional cryptocurrency licence from the New York State Department of Financial Services. The company will initially allow purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies called ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin, it said.

PayPal is teaming up with cryptocurrency firm Paxos Trust Company to offer the service.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/la6kci/article32915189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/paypaljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/paypal-to-open-up-network-to-cryptocurrencies/article32915118.ece
15,2020/10/22,Saad Hariri renamed Lebanon PM,"Three-time Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri was renamed to the post on Thursday to create a cabinet that can lift the country out of its worst economic crisis in decades.

Mr. Hariri, 50, made his comeback almost a year after stepping down under pressure from a protest movement demanding an overhaul of Lebanon’s political system. The country is under international pressure to form a crisis cabinet to address a plummeting economy made worse by COVID-19 and the blast at the Beirut port on August 4.

Immediately after President Michel Aoun named him, the returning premier vowed to form a cabinet of experts, in line with conditions set by French President Emmanuel Macron to help rescue the debt-ridden country from crisis.

Hariri said he would “form a cabinet of non politically aligned experts with the mission of economic, financial and administrative reforms contained in the French initiative roadmap”.

“I will work on forming a government quickly because time is running out,” he said, calling it the country’s “only and last chance”.

He was set to start consulting the country’s various parliamentary blocs from Friday, the parliament said in a statement.

Cabinet formation is often a drawn-out process in Lebanon, where a complex governing system seeks to maintain a precarious balance between its various political and religious communities.

Hariri himself took eight months to hammer out his last cabinet after 2018 parliamentary elections.

Celebratory gunfire

His nomination on Thursday was backed by a majority of 65 lawmakers, while 53 abstained from naming anyone during consultations with the president.

The parliamentary bloc of the powerful Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah did not give the president a name of a preferred candidate, but its main ally the Amal Movement supported Hariri’s nomination.

The UN envoy to Lebanon Jan Kubis said the onus was once again on political parties to back change.

“It is the traditional political forces that have again put on themselves to choose the way forward, regardless (of) their numerous failures in the past and deep skepticism about the future,” he wrote on Twitter.

There was no immediate reaction in the streets from the protest movement, which had however long said it did want the return of the political old guard it accuses of ineptitude and corruption.

Hariri’s supporters fired celebratory gunfire in the northern city of Tripoli, which a medical source told AFP wounded three including an elderly man and someone cleaning in front of his shop.

Hariri’s return to politics comes after Beirut’s massive port blast killed more than 200 people and devastated swathes of the capital in the country’s worst peacetime disaster.

The authorities said the August 4 explosion occurred after a fire broke out in a warehouse storing hundreds of tonnes of ammonium nitrate.

A probe into the cause of one of the largest non-nuclear blasts ever has resulted in the arrest of 25 people, including top port and customs officials.

‘Political interference’

But Human Rights Watch said Thursday the probe had failed to yield any credible results more than two months later, and called for an “independent, international investigation”.

“Political interference coupled with long-standing failings of the judicial system have made a credible and impartial domestic investigation seemingly impossible,” the rights group said.

Outrage over the disaster blamed on official negligence led to the resignation of the government of prime minister Hassan Diab, who was replaced by a relatively unknown diplomat, Mustapha Adib.

But Adib faced resistance from some of the main parties and threw in the towel less than a month later, leaving Lebanon rudderless to face soaring poverty.

Aoun Wednesday accused unnamed officials of blocking reforms long demanded by international donors, including the overhaul of the power sector and a forensic audit of the central bank.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian Wednesday warned change was desperately needed in the former French protectorate.

“The more we wait, the more the boat sinks,” he said.

Demonstrations against Hariri took place in central Beirut late Wednesday.

Dozens of protesters shouted slogans against him and faced off with his supporters as security forces stepped in between both sides.

Local media said Hariri supporters burned a giant cut-out of a clenched fist bearing the word “thawra” or revolution in Arabic but his party denied any involvement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uoaa5w/article32917788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN22LEBANON-CRISISHARIRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/saad-hariri-renamed-lebanon-pm/article32922061.ece
16,2020/10/22,Sri Lanka: Controversial 20th Amendment passed,"The controversial 20th Amendment to Sri Lanka’s Constitution that envisages expansive powers and greater immunity for the Executive President was passed in Parliament with a two-thirds majority, following a two-day debate.

The 20th Amendment was the Rajapaksa administration’s first big test in the legislature, since it triggered concern and resistance from not just the political opposition, but also the influential Buddhist clergy that Sri Lanka’s southern polity venerates.

As many as 156 MPs in the 225-member House voted for it, while 65 legislators voted against the Bill.

Significantly, eight opposition MPs voted in favour of the legislation that their parties and leaders not only vehemently opposed, but also challenged at the Supreme Court. Following as many as 39 petitions filed by opposition parties and civil society groups, the Supreme Court determined that the passage of the legislation required only a two-thirds majority, except for four clauses that needed additional public approval through a referendum, unless they were amended in line with the determination.

Ceremonial role

The 20th Amendment rolls back Sri Lanka’s 19th Amendment, a 2015 legislation passed with wide support from the Rajapaksa camp — then in Opposition — that sought to clip presidential powers, while strengthening Parliament. The new legislation in turn reduces the Prime Minister’s role to a ceremonial one.

In the two-day debate, opposition MPs broadly argued that the Amendment threatened to take the country on the path of authoritarianism, giving the President unbridled powers, while government MPs emphasised the need for centralised power for better governance.

The 20th Amendment’s passage comes at a time when the country is facing a new wave of COVID-19, with the number of cases rapidly increasing — after Sri Lanka contained the pandemic in the early months — to 6,028 cases and 14 deaths as of Thursday evening.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/b7yt39/article32921799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22SRILANKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-controversial-20th-amendment-passed/article32921800.ece
17,2020/10/22,Golden Dawn leaders sent to prison,"A Greek court on Thursday ruled to imprison the leadership of the extreme right-wing Golden Dawn party, following their convictions for running the party like a criminal organisation, but granted suspended sentences to five of the party’s 18 former lawmakers, who were convicted of lesser charges.

The ruling came after two weeks of summations by defense lawyers following the prosecutor’s recommendation that all former Golden Dawn lawmakers be allowed to remain free pending appeal.

The party was founded as a neo-Nazi group in the 1980s and rose to prominence during Greece’s financial crisis. It was blamed for planning multiple hate crimes, including brutal street attacks on immigrants and left-wing activists. Eleven former party leaders convicted of simple participation received sentences of between five and seven years.

The decision ends a five-year-long trial involving 68 defendants, dozens of lawyers, and encompassing four cases, including the 2013 fatal stabbing of left-wing Greek rap singer Pavlos Fyssas and physical attacks on Egyptian fishermen and left-wing activists. Fyssa’s killer, Giorgos Roupakias, was also ordered to begin serving his life sentence.

18,2020/10/22,"Arce’s victory is legitimate, says OAS","International observers on Wednesday declared Bolivia’s presidential election transparent and Luis Arce’s incoming leftist government legitimate, as an official but incomplete tally showed an overwhelming victory for the ex-president Evo Morales’ protege.

The findings are sharply different from 2019 elections, when Mr. Arce’s former boss, Mr. Morales, won an unconstitutional fourth term in polls that sparked weeks of protests, leaving 36 dead and 800 wounded. .

“People voted freely and the result was clear and overwhelming, granting strong legitimacy to the incoming government, to Bolivian institutions and the electoral process,” Manuel Gonzalez, head of the observer mission for the Organization of American States, said while releasing the team’s preliminary report on Sunday’s polls. With over 90% of polling places accounted for, Mr. Arce has 54.5%, Centrist ex-president Carlos Mesa has 29.2%, followed by right-winger Luis Fernando Camacho with 14.2%.

Despite the pandemic, a record 87 percent of Bolivians voted, according to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.

“Thanks to the audit report carried out after last year’s elections, today the country has an independent electoral authority and had a more equitable and transparent contest,” said Gonzalez, a former foreign minister of Costa Rica.

Arce’s rivals also recognized his victory, including Mesa and interim president Jeanine Anez, a fierce critic of Arce’s leftist MAS party and of ex-president Morales.

In addition to the OAS findings, the results have been in line with projections from two private polling firms on the night of the election.

The European Union and US-based Carter Center also sent missions to observe the vote.

The Bolivian constitution declares the candidate who obtains an absolute majority or 40 percent of the vote with a 10-point advantage over their nearest challenger as the winner in the first round. Otherwise, there must be a second round.

Despite that, hundreds of Bolivians have protested in Santa Cruz, a right-wing bastion, and in the central city of Cochabamba, claiming fraud in Arce’s win and opposing a return to Bolivia of the exiled Morales. A crowd also gathered to protest in the capital La Paz.

Morales reviled by conservatives

Arce was credited as the architect of Bolivia’s economic miracle under Morales, who became the country’s first indigenous president in 2006.

Over the next decade, Arce slashed poverty levels and modernized the nation’s infrastructure, boosted by demand for Bolivia’s natural resources.

The election, twice postponed due to the coronavirus, was the first in 20 years not to feature Morales, who resigned and fled into exile after the 2019 protests.

An interim administration was set up, led by right-wing senator Anez.

She withdrew her candidacy for the presidential vote shortly before the election.

Morales, currently in Buenos Aires, on Monday signaled his intention to return to Bolivia after Arce’s sweeping victory.

He faces arrest on terrorism charges after the right-wing interim government accused him of directing anti-government protests from exile.

Morales is also being investigated over allegations of “rape and trafficking” of underage girls.

The leftist ex-president dismissed the accusations, saying they were “part of a dirty war” waged against him.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/arces-victory-is-legitimate-says-oas/article32921597.ece
19,2020/10/22,Sri Lankan government confident of support for passage of the 20th Amendment in Parliament,"We have sorted out all issues and found answers for a positive outcome, Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Energy said.

The Sri Lankan government is confident of securing a two-third majority for the passage of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution that aims to bolster the powers of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa when the vote on the bill will take place in Parliament on Thursday, according to official sources.

The government on September 2 gazetted 20A, a new proposed legislation that would replace the 19th Amendment introduced in 2015 that curtailed the powers of the president and strengthened the role of Parliament.

The bill was presented in Parliament on Wednesday for a two-day debate following which a vote will take place later on Thursday. The amendment would become a part of the country’s basic law after Assembly Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena signs it.

We have sorted out all issues and found answers for a positive outcome, Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Energy said.

Mr. Gammanpila and his ministerial colleague Wimal Weerawansa had led a discussion with a group of members in the government who are opposed to the 20A even after they pledged to move amendments so that a referendum would not be needed to write it to the statute books.

The government insiders were confident of at least 6 Opposition defections, while the Opposition said that at least two government members would either abstain or would vote against the bill.

The government on Wednesday said it would move as many as five amendments to the bill during the parliamentary debate.

We will make three of the amendments asked for by the Supreme Court while adding two more of our own, Mr. Gammanpila had said.

The Supreme Court had ruled that the 20A as a whole was not unconstitutional except for the 4 clauses which needed a referendum. It said that Clauses 3,5,14 and 22 in the amendment in their present form are inconsistent with Article 3 read with Article 4 of the Constitution and requires a referendum.

The Attorney General, on behalf of the government, had pledged that amendments would be made at the committee stage so that no referendum would be required.

The thrust of the debate on Wednesday was that the 20A was only meant to restore the powers enjoyed by the president since the original 1978 constitution.

The pro-democracy, good governance 19A adopted in 2015 was an impediment on the smooth functioning of the state as two political power houses being built around both the president who heads the executive and the prime minister who heads the Parliament.

The 19A was also branded as one adopted to target the powerful Rajapaksa family — to subject them to politically whipped up charges of wrongdoing and to prevent some of the family members from staking a claim to high profile political offices.

The 20A was needed to preserve national security and to effect rapid economic development through an efficiency based state administration, it was debated.

The Opposition’s defence was that the 19A had depoliticised key areas of governance by preserving the rule of law. The 20A rolls back all that and makes one person — the president- all too powerful with no checks and balances.

The 20A is meant to annul the 19A which was seen as a pro-democracy, good governance amendment and called for checks and balances in the presidential system while making Parliament more powerful.

The 20th Amendment proposes to restore full legal immunity to the President, removing the provisions made in the 19A to take legal action against the President.

President Rajapaksa was elected with a mandate to abolish the 19A.

During the last November’s presidential elections and last month’s parliamentary elections, Gotabaya Rajapaksa said that the 19A had made governance difficult as it created a rift between the executive president and the prime minister.

Interestingly, the current prime minister is the president’s elder brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was earlier president of the country for two terms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lankan-government-confident-of-support-for-passage-of-20a-in-parliament/article32919182.ece
20,2020/10/22,"COVID-19 deaths: U.K. to record ethnicity to assess impact on Indians, minorities","Minister for Equalities Kemi Badenoch presents the first quarterly report on progress to understand and tackle COVID-19 disparities on ethnicity grounds

The U.K. government on October 22 laid out a series of measures as part of a review into the higher COVID-19 death rate among people of Indian-origin and other ethnic minorities, including a mandate for ethnicity to be recorded as part of the death certification process.

Minister for Equalities Kemi Badenoch made an oral statement in the House of Commons as she presented the first quarterly report to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock on progress to understand and tackle COVID-19 disparities on ethnicity grounds.

The report follows an official review set up in the wake of a Public Health England (PHE) analysis tabled in Parliament earlier this year, which concluded that older Indian-origin men fall within a higher risk category of coronavirus deaths in England along with other black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups.

“Today’s report marks an important first step in our journey to understand and tackle the disproportionate impact of COVID,” said Ms. Badenoch.

“Access to the latest public health information and protections should be available to everyone. To ensure that is the case we have invested in a strong package of measures to target messaging, develop the data we have available and make sure everyone is as safe as possible at home or in the workplace,” she said.

‘Evidence-based, efficient action’

Besides an ethnicity column on death certificates, the other measures set out by the Minister include a new “Community Champions” scheme, worth up to 25 million pounds, to provide funding to enhance existing communication strategies in the most-at-risk places and communities.

The national “Shielded Patients List”, or those deemed within the highest risk category and asked to shield at home, will also be enhanced for a better understanding of the risk factors related to the virus and the drivers of disparities.

“It is vital that we understand the key drivers of the health disparities caused by COVID-19 and set out evidence-based, efficient action to tackle them,” said Dr. Rohini Mathur, the Indian-origin Assistant Professor of Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

“This report is a strong step on the path to doing this, highlighting important findings, dispelling damaging misinformation and presenting clear steps to address the impact of the virus on ethnic minority communities,” she said.

A related review to the PHE report had claimed that “historic racism” may be behind the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on ethnic minorities. However, a specially-appointed government adviser has ruled out racism as the key driver and pointed to economic areas, such as jobs and housing, as the defining factors.

“Instead of focusing on ethnicity we need to look at the key underlying risk factors [which are mainly socioeconomic] that are causing their higher death rates — and that will therefore reduce the risk of death in all ethnic groups, including whites,” said Dr. Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate at the MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge.

“The main differences are due to increased risk of infection, with black and Asian people more likely to live in deprivation, in densely populated urban centres with higher levels of air pollution, and in larger, multi-generational households. They also have a higher risk of a poorer outcome once infected, due to higher levels of comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes,” he said.

The government has appointed Ali and Professor Keith Neal from the University of Nottingham as special advisers to work alongside the Cabinet Office’s Race Disparity Unit to provide further advice and support on action required in addressing COVID-19 related ethnic disparities.

The government said that since the PHE report, ‘Disparities in the risk and outcomes of COVID-19’, highlighted the ethnic variations within the impact of the pandemic it has taken several steps, including 4.3 million pounds of spending on six innovative research projects to better understand the links between COVID-19 and ethnicity.

Health inequalities and COVID019

An additional 4 million pounds has been allocated for targeting messaging at ethnic minority communities and frontline National Health Service (NHS) staff from ethnic minority backgrounds undergoing risk assessment.

“This important report into health inequalities and COVID-19 draws together important strands of evidence to highlight the disproportionate impact on ethnic minorities by identifying the key factors that contribute to their increased risk of infection and adverse outcomes,” said Professor Sir Mark Caulfield, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, Queen Mary University of London and Chief Scientist for Genomics England.

“These include household size, deprivation, co-morbidities and particularly occupation which highlights the vital contribution our diverse communities have made as key workers on the frontline during the pandemic,” he said.

Following the quarterly update on the ongoing review, the Cabinet Office said that the evidence and data gathered will be translated into further action required to protect those that are at greatest risk.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/91yzqg/article32918760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BRITAIN-UK-CORONA-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-deaths-uk-to-record-ethnicity-to-assess-impact-on-indians-minorities/article32918761.ece
21,2020/10/22,EU awards human rights prize to Belarus opposition,"Opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya joined the race after her husband who aspired to run for president was jailed.

The European Union has awarded its top human rights prize to the Belarus opposition movement and its leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, for their challenge to President Alexander Lukashenko’s long, hard-line reign.

“It is an honour to announce that the women and men of the democratic opposition in Belarus are the 2020 Sakharov Prize laureates,” European Parliament president David Sassoli said.

“They have on their side something that brute force can never defeat: the truth. Do not give up on your fight. We are by your side.” The 27-nation bloc agreed this month to impose sanctions against officials suspected of election misconduct and a brutal security crackdown on protesters in Belarus. The EU has warned it is ready to sanction Lukashenko himself if he fails to enter into talks with the opposition and order an end to the repression launched after a disputed election.

Mr. Lukashenko won his sixth term in office in a presidential election widely seen as rigged. Since the Aug. 9 polls that handed Mr. Lukashenko a victory with 80% of the vote, mass protests have rocked the ex-Soviet nation sandwiched between Poland and Russia.

Ms. Tsikhanouskaya, Mr. Lukashenko’s main challenger, got 10% of the vote. She and her supporters refused to recognise the results, saying the outcome of the vote was manipulated.

A 38-year old former English teacher with no previous political experience, Ms. Tsikhanouskaya joined the race after her husband who aspired to run for president was jailed. He has remained in prison.

Ms. Tsikhanouskaya has rejected the official tally and refused to concede defeat, but was forced to move to Lithuania under pressure from authorities.

Ms. Tsikhanouskaya shares the prize with several leading members of the opposition’s Coordination Council, which was created after the election in a bid to facilitate talks on a transition of power.

The EU award, named after Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, was created in 1988 to honor individuals or groups who defend human rights and fundamental freedoms. Last year’s winner was economist Ilham Tohti for his work defending China’s Uighur minority.

Others on the shortlist for the award this year were activists defending the Guapinol river in Honduras and murdered environmental activist and indigenous leader Berta Caceres. Najeeb Michaeel, the archbishop of Mosul, also made the cut for his role in the evacuation of Christians, Syriacs and Chaldeans to Iraqi Kurdistan and safeguarding historic manuscripts after the Islamic State arrived in Mosul in 2014.

The prize will be presented in a ceremony in Strasbourg, France, on Dec 16.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9hvo0w/article32918541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EUROPESAKHAROVPRIZE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-awards-human-rights-prize-to-belarus-opposition/article32918542.ece
22,2020/10/22,Hariri secures parliamentary support to be Lebanon's next PM,"Lebanon's leading Sunni Muslim politician Saad al-Hariri secured enough support in parliamentary talks on Thursday to be named prime minister and try to form a government to tackle the worst crisis since the country's 1975-1990 civil war.

A tally by Reuters and local media of nominations declared by politicians after consultations with President Michel Aoun showed Hariri had won the backing of 47 parliamentarians, more than the number of MPs yet to formally declare their stance.

Mr. Hariri would still face major challenges to navigate Lebanon's power-sharing politics and agree a cabinet, which must then address a mounting list of woes: a banking crisis, currency crash, rising poverty and crippling state debts.

A new government will also have to contend with a COVID-19 surge and the fallout of the huge August explosion at Beirut port that killed nearly 200 people and caused billions of dollars of damage.

23,2020/10/22,"Vatican, China extend bishop agreement over US opposition","The Holy See and Beijing government jointly announced a two-year extension to the 2018 agreement, which expired Thursday

The Vatican and China extended a controversial accord on bishop nominations Thursday over strong opposition from the White House and conservative Catholics.

The Holy See and Beijing government jointly announced a two-year extension to the 2018 agreement, which expired Thursday. The Vatican defended the extension by saying the agreement was purely ecclesiastic and pastoral in nature, and not political.

The agreement, which hasn’t ever been published, envisages a process of dialogue in selecting bishops. The Vatican signed it in 2018 in hopes it would help unite China’s Catholics, who for seven decades have been split between those belonging to an official, state-sanctioned church and an underground church loyal to Rome.

The Vatican has defended the 2018 accord against criticism that Pope Francis sold out the underground faithful, saying the deal was necessary to prevent an even worse schism in the Chinese church after Beijing named bishops without the pope’s consent.

The question of bishop nominations has long vexed Vatican-China relations, with the Holy See insisting on the pope’s divine right to name the successors of the apostles and Beijing considering such nominations foreign infringement on its sovereignty.

The Holy See considers the initial application of the agreement — which is of great ecclesial and pastoral value — to have been positive, thanks to good communication and cooperation between the parties on the matters agreed upon, and intends to pursue an open and constructive dialogue for the benefit of the life of the Catholic Church and the good of Chinese people, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/862f1o/article32917674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VATICAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vatican-china-extend-bishop-agreement-over-us-opposition/article32917675.ece
24,2020/10/22,Banksy artwork sells for almost $10 million at auction,"Banksy’s playful take on a famous Impressionist painting has sold at auction for 7.6 million pounds ($9.8 million), the second-highest price ever paid for a work by the British street artist.

‘Show Me the Monet’ sold to an unidentified bidder at Sotheby’s in London on Wednesday evening, surpassing its upper pre-sale estimate of 5 million pounds.

In the 2005 work, Banksy added abandoned shopping carts and an orange traffic cone to Claude Monet’s image of water lilies in his garden at Giverny.

Alex Branczik, Sotheby’s European head of contemporary art, said the work was one of the strongest and most iconic Banksy works to appear at auction.

Banksy, whose real name has never been officially confirmed, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world’s best-known artists.

Another Banksy work, Devolved Parliament, sold last year at Sotheby’s in London for 9.9 million pounds.

25,2020/10/22,"Germany’s virus situation ‘very serious’, says health body","Germany, like many European countries, has been facing a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases for several weeks.

Germany is facing a “very serious” rise in coronavirus cases, the head of the Robert Koch Institute disease control centre said Thursday, as the country reported a record 11,287 new infections.

It is still possible to bring the virus under control through “systematic compliance with restrictive measures”, Lothar Wieler said.

But “the overall situation has become very serious,” he added.

Germany, like many European countries, has been facing a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases for several weeks.

Thursday's caseload far exceeds the previous record of 7,830 recorded last Friday, and is a steep jump from the 7,595 cases reported on Wednesday.

Faced with the rebound, authorities have toughened measures to curb the spread of the pandemic, such as banning large gatherings.

Local restrictions have also been imposed — in Berlin, it is now compulsory to wear a mask on certain busy streets.

Wieler on Thursday blamed private gatherings, especially among young people, for the dramatic rise in cases.

“The more people gather in private circles, the more the numbers will increase and the further the virus will spread,” he said, noting that “the young are currently the most exposed to this virus”.

Wieler urged people to observe the rules but cautioned that an ""uncontrolled"" spread could be unavoidable in some regions.

On Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel asked citizens to cut down on socialising, encouraging them to stay at home instead.

“What winter will be, what our Christmas will be, will be decided in the days and weeks to come,” she warned.

At least 392,049 people have been infected in Germany since the outbreak of the virus, with 9,905 deaths reported.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nye7i5/article32916712.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Germany,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/germanys-virus-situation-very-serious-says-health-body/article32916713.ece
26,2020/10/22,"In Pakistan, police and military in direct conflict over arrest of Nawaz Sharif’s son-in-law","Opposition parties have alleged that the Sindh police chief was reportedly forcibly taken away by paramilitary forces from his home in Karachi in the wee hours of Monday and pressurised to order for the arrest of Sharif’s son-in-law.

Pakistan’s Sindh Police chief has deferred his leave and asked his officers to set aside their leave applications for ten days “in the larger national interest” after Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa ordered an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the arrest of former premier Nawaz Sharif’s son-in-law, an issue that brought the paramilitary forces and police in direct conflict in the country’s largest city.

In a series of tweets, Sindh Police said on Tuesday that the “unfortunate incident” that occurred on the night of 18/19 October caused “great heartache and resentment” within its ranks, referring to the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Sharif’s son-in-law Capt (retd) Muhammad Safdar.

The incident

Opposition parties have alleged that the Sindh police chief was reportedly forcibly taken away by paramilitary Frontier Corps from his home in Karachi in the wee hours of Monday and pressurised to order for the arrest of Safdar.

“As a result, IG Sindh decided to proceed on leave and subsequently all ranks decided that they would also apply for leave to protest the humiliation meted out to Sindh police. This was a spontaneous and heartfelt reaction and made on an individual rather than a collective basis, because every single member of the department felt an acute sense of disrespect,” it said.

The Sindh Police thanked Gen Bajwa for “realising the sense of hurt that prevailed within a uniformed force, and for promptly ordering an inquiry into the matter”.

“IG Sindh has decided to defer his own leave and ordered his officers to set aside their leave applications for ten days in the larger national interest, pending the conclusion of the inquiry,” it said.

The Sindh Police also thanked Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah for showing solidarity with the police leadership. The PPP is the ruling party in Sindh province.

On Wednesday, Chief Minister Shah met IGP Mushtaq Mahar and other top officers to assure them that the government was with them.

“Sindh government is with its police in their difficult time. We will not let police be demoralised under any condition,” he said.

He asked the police officers to continue their duties in an objective and independent manner and said his government would try to address their grievances.

The police officers decided to delay their leave for 10-days.

Direct conflict

On Tuesday, Sindh IGP, at least two additional inspectors general, seven deputy inspectors general and six senior superintendents of police decided to go on long leave in protest over the siege of Inspector General House that brought the law enforcement agency and security establishment in direct conflict, Dawn reported.

Safdar was arrested on Monday from his hotel room in Karachi for raising slogans at the mausoleum of Pakistan’s founder M.A. Jinnah just before the second rally of the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s — an alliance of 11 Opposition parties.

He was released on bail on the same day and flew back to Lahore, but the PPP which rules the province while distancing itself from the incident wondered who had ordered the arrest of Safdar.

Controversy had already been brewing over the circumstances surrounding Safdar’s arrest, with PML-N leaders claiming that the police had been put under pressure to pick him up.

Sindh Police’s Digital Media Cell had tweeted, then deleted, then tweeted again a statement defending Safdar’s arrest, saying it was done “according to the law”, Geo TV reported.

Following the controversy, Gen Bajwa directed the Karachi Corps Commander to “immediately inquire into the circumstances to determine the facts and report back as soon as possible”.

“Taking notice of the Karachi incident, the COAS has directed Karachi Corps Commander to immediately inquire into the circumstances to determine the facts and report back as soon as possible,” a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations — the military’s media wing — said on Tuesday.

Back story

Safdar, a retired Army officer, and his wife PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz were in Karachi to attend the rally of the Opposition parties when he was arrested. Police allegedly forcibly entered their room in the hotel after breaking the latch of the door. The Opposition parties are holding nationwide protests against the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan.

The incident left the provincial PPP government red faced as the couple was their guest in Karachi.

Mr.Bilawal in a press conference said that all top officers of Sindh Police were wondering “who were the people who surrounded” the Sindh police chief’s house on Monday and took him to an unspecified location before Safdar was arrested.

He had demanded that the Army chief and the ISI chief should probe the matter as the paramilitary Frontier Corps, controlled by the Army, was accused of forcing the police to arrest Safdar.

He also demanded to know the identities of “the two people who went inside the IG’s house” at around 4 a.m.

Meanwhile, Information Minister Shibli Faraz said that opposition parties were targeting institutions to create uncertainty.

“They have tried to spark a conflict between the institutions [and] are trying to create uncertainty and unrest. The people will hold them accountable for this,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/w4e2db/article32916668.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAKISTANTHNAK-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/in-pakistan-police-and-military-in-direct-conflict-over-arrest-of-nawaz-sharifs-son-in-law/article32916669.ece
27,2020/10/22,Deport Nawaz Sharif from London: Pakistan requests UK for third time,"The former Pakistan Prime Minister is in London for medical treatment.

Pakistan has requested the UK for a third time to deport former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from London to serve his prison term in the country after being sentenced in corruption cases, according to a media report on Thursday.

Sharif, the 70-year-old supremo of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) who was ousted from power in 2017 by the Supreme Court on corruption charges, is in London for medical treatment.

A letter for the deportation of the three-time Prime Minister was handed over personally to the British High Commissioner here some three weeks ago, Dawn newspaper reported.

Also read: The rise and fall of Nawaz Sharif

Through the letter, the Pakistani government asked the British authorities to consider cancelling Sharif’s visit visa, which has allowed him to live in London on medical grounds since November.

The letter has cited Britain’s own immigration laws of 1974 under which any person sentenced to imprisonment of more than four years had to be deported to the country of his/her origin.

When contacted, Shahzad Akbar, Adviser to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Accountability and Interior confirmed that the government has made three requests to the UK authorities to deport Sharif, with the last being on October 5.

The previous letter, he said, had been dispatched after the cancellation of Sharif’s bail by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) last month.

In the latest letter, the government has pointed to a possible way out of the issue of specific deportation of the former premier, Mr. Akbar said, adding that the ball is now in the court of British government .

The IHC on September 15 issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Sharif in the Al Azizia case while hearing three applications filed by him, including the ones about forgoing the requirement of his surrender before the court and exemption from personal appearance.

The former Prime Minister left for the UK in November last year after the Lahore High Court granted him permission to go abroad for medical treatment.

He had submitted an undertaking to the court that he would return within four weeks or as soon as he was declared healthy and fit to travel by doctors.

Sharif criticised the military establishment in recent speeches at gatherings of the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement.

Days before the July 2018 general elections, Sharif was convicted in the Avenfield properties case and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His daughter Maryam was sentenced to seven years in prison for abetment and his son-in-law Captain (retd) Mohammad Safdar to one year.

In December 2018, anti-corruption court judge Arshad Malik convicted Sharif in Al-Azizia Steel Mills case and sentenced him to seven years in prison. Judge Malik was later dismissed from service over misconduct.

The IHC later granted bail to Sharif, Maryam and Safdar. Sharif, after his conviction in the Al-Azizia case, was sent to jail but released for eight weeks on medical grounds. The bail-granting order lapsed while the former premier was in London.

The IHC had in September fixed the appeals against conviction of Sharif in Al-Azizia and Avenfield cases. After hearing the pleas, the court rejected Sharif’s applications seeking hearing in absentia and issued his non-bailable arrest warrants.

The court then issued his proclamation giving the former premier final opportunity to join the proceeding before confiscating his properties.

Separately, an accountability court in Islamabad has already confiscated movable and immovable properties of Sharif because he absconded in the Toshakhana case, which is about alleged corruption in purchase of vehicles.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gouqv2/article32916539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAKISTANPOLITICSTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/deport-nawaz-sharif-from-london-pakistan-requests-uk-for-third-time/article32916540.ece
28,2020/10/22,U.S. presidential elections | Final debate could thrust foreign policy back into campaign,"Both campaigns believe their competing approaches can sway voters.

As Joe Biden hopscotched through Iowa and New Hampshire in late 2019, he also name-dropped his way across the globe.

China’s Xi Jinping. German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Vladimir Putin of Russia.

“I’ve met every major world leader for the last 40 years,” the former Vice President and eventual Democratic presidential nominee said.

Behind the braggadocio was something Mr. Biden saw as a chief selling point for his third White House bid: His decades as a leading senator and two-term Vice President make him ready on day one to restore a world order he believes President Donald Trump has destabilized.

Mr. Biden’s foreign policy credentials have largely been overshadowed by questions about how he would lead the U.S. through the worst pandemic in a century. But the issue could re-emerge on Thursday as Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden take the stage for a final debate, with a topic list including national security.

Competing approaches

Both campaigns believe their competing approaches — Mr. Trump’s America First doctrine that he says ended an era of other nations taking advantage of the United States; Mr. Biden’s pledge to reinvigorate a network of Western democracies — can sway voters.

The 800-pound gorilla that will be making its presence felt on January 21 is still going to be COVID-19, said Tony Blinken, Mr. Biden’s top foreign policy adviser, describing the pandemic as the first big national security challenge that would require Mr. Biden to make good on his promise of better coordination among the U.S. and its allies.

But, Mr. Blinken said, “The world doesn’t stop just because we have this COVID crisis. We would have to walk and chew a lot of gum at the same time.”

On immigration policies

Mr. Biden blisters Mr. Trump on everything from his hard-line immigration policies and dismissing the climate crisis to criticizing NATO allies and embracing Putin and North Korea’s authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un.

In an ABC News town hall last week, Mr. Biden credited Mr. Trump for recently cementing diplomatic ties between Israel and two Arab neighbours: Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. But, Mr. Biden said, the President still has no coherent plan for foreign policy beyond America alone.

Also read: U.S. presidential polls | Trump campaign proposes new debate dates; Biden team rejects

Mr. Trump counters that America First is more than sloganeering. He won a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, curtailed legal immigration, wielded tariff powers and insists he’s staring down Beijing’s Xi on trade — efforts he frames as benefiting American workers.

Foreign policy pitch

Yet heading into the final debate, Mr. Trump’s loudest foreign policy pitch isn’t about his record. It’s casting Mr. Biden as corrupt because of his son Hunter’s business associations in Ukraine and China.

The President has promoted an unconfirmed New York Post report published last week that cites an email in which an official from Ukrainian gas company Burisma thanked Hunter Biden, who served on the company’s board, for arranging for him to meet Joe Biden during a 2015 visit to Washington.

Also read: Biden against second debate if Trump still suffers from COVID-19

The Biden campaign has rejected Trump’s assertion of wrongdoing and noted that Mr. Biden’s schedule did not show a meeting with the Burisma official.

Once the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Biden hails from the bipartisan establishment that shaped U.S. international policy from World War II’s end until Trump’s election.

Mr. Biden sees the international order established over that span — NATO, the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization — as anchoring global stability, with the U.S. leading as the world’s democratic superpower, rivaled only by one-party China.

Mr. Trump eschews those institutions and their multilateral efforts. He’s withdrawn the U.S. from the World Health Organization, the Paris accords to reduce carbon pollution worldwide and a multinational deal that limited Iran’s nuclear program. He’s pledged to withdraw thousands of troops from Germany, a notable retreat from the post-WWII framework.

To Mr. Biden, those moves invite Russian aggression in Europe and an unchecked Beijing.

Mr. Trump undoubtedly has been an international force. His NAFTA overhaul drew bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. The latest Middle East deal is a historic step, though it doesn’t address the region’s biggest unresolved matters: the Syrian civil war, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and the land dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.

Mr. Biden has promised immediate changes.

He’d recommit to the Paris accords while rejoining WHO and restoring its U.S. financial support. He’s pledged to reverse Trump’s executive actions limiting travel from certain Muslim nations and curtailing the U.S. asylum program for refugees.

He’d restore foreign aid programs to other Western Hemisphere nations, especially in Central America, where economic and political instability drive migration patterns to the U.S. Aides said Biden would likely halt troop reductions in Europe, believing those postings are fundamental to the U.S. commitment to NATO and containment of Russian ambitions on the continent.

Mr. Biden also promises to confront Putin, whom he describes as a thug, over interference in U.S. elections via social media and other means. Trump has publicly rejected U.S. intelligence findings that Russia interfered in 2016 and is doing so again in 2020 in ways intended to help Mr. Trump.

Some key questions heading into the debate:

CAN TRUMP CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE RACE?: Mr. Trump cannot afford a status quo debate. National polls show him losing to Biden, and while some battleground state polls are tighter, even some of Trump’s own allies are worrying aloud about the prospect of a serious defeat. This debate represents his best, and perhaps last, opportunity to change the contours of the race while tens of millions of Americans are watching.

The President fumbled his chance in the opening debate last month, when his attack-all-the-time approach backfired. Trump missed another opportunity when he refused to participate in the second debate after organizers decided the candidates would face each other virtually because of concerns about the president’s coronavirus infection.

Mr. Trump needs to find a way to focus the debate — and the election more broadly — on Mr. Biden and his liabilities. But to do that, he needs to avoid making himself the centre of attention, something that doesn’t come naturally to the president.

WILL THE MUTE BUTTON KEEP THINGS CIVIL?: The mute button has gotten a lot of attention leading up to the debate, but its impact may be overstated.

Given Mr. Trump’s unrelenting interruptions in the first debate, the Commission on Presidential Debates added a new rule for Thursday’s affair that will keep each candidate muted while the other delivers his two-minute remarks at the outset of each of the six debate topics. The remainder of each 15-minute block will be open discussion, without any muting, the commission says.

The change will ensure the candidates have at least some time to answer questions without interference. Ultimately, however, the mute button can only be used for a combined total of 24 minutes of the 90-minute debate. That’s plenty of time for the candidates to mix it up.

DOES TRUMP HAVE A BETTER ANSWER FOR THE PANDEMIC?: Whether he wants to or not, the President will have to talk about the coronavirus at length. And he has to come up with a better answer than he did during the first debate to convince persuadable voters that he has the situation under control.

It won’t be easy.

Coronavirus infections are surging to their highest levels in months. More than 220,000 Americans are dead. And rather than working on a comprehensive plan to stop the spread based on science, Mr. Trump has spent recent days attacking the nation’s most respected infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, while undermining his own administration’s recommendation to wear masks.

In the first debate, Mr. Trump pointed to his months-old decision to institute a partial travel ban on China as evidence he was doing a good job. He’s also highlighted carefully selected statistics that downplayed the extent of the crisis. He’ll have to come with something better than that if he’s going to convince anyone but his most loyal base that he hasn’t completely surrendered to the deadliest U.S. health crisis in a century.

HOW WILL BIDEN HANDLE ATTACKS AGAINST HIS SON? Mr. Trump and his allies in the conservative media have ramped up their focus on alleged maleficence by Mr. Biden’s son Hunter in recent days. Mr. Biden’s team expects Mr. Trump to make those allegations a centerpiece of his debate strategy.

The President tried to make an issue in the first debate of Hunter Biden and his drug use, which the younger Biden has publicly acknowledged. But Trump’s attack may have backfired when Mr. Biden declared that he was proud of his son, who, like many Americans, had fought to overcome an addiction.

Mr. Trump believes he has more ammunition this time around, however, following the publication of a tabloid report offering a bizarre twist to familiar concerns about Hunter Biden’s work overseas. The report centres on data allegedly recovered from Hunter Biden’s laptop, though the data has not been verified and, if it is legitimate, does not tie candidate Mr. Biden to any corruption.

Mr. Biden’s team considers the issue a distraction from much more pressing concerns — namely, the pandemic — but Mr. Biden will certainly have to defend himself and his family again on Thursday night.

CAN BIDEN AVOID PLAYING INTO GOP NARRATIVE? Mr. Biden’s greatest foe Thursday night may be himself.

Mr. Trump has struggled to find an effective line of attack against the 77-year-old Democrat, but the lifetime politician has a well-established history of gaffes that has made him the butt of Republican jokes for years.

To that end, the 74-year-old Mr. Trump and his allies spent much of the year questioning Mr. Biden’s mental and physical health. While Mr. Biden quieted those questions with a solid performance in the first debate, they have not gone away. He needs to avoid any embarrassing missteps on stage that would play into the broader Republican narrative that he’s ill-equipped to lead the free world.

Mr. Biden will certainly be prepared. He spent four of the last five days with no public events so he could focus almost exclusively on debate prep.

Still, Mr. Biden’s history of self-imposed stumbles raises the distinct possibility that he could hurt his campaign, with or without Trump’s help. It doesn’t help Mr. Biden that expectations will be higher after Trump’s weak performance in the first debate.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/59imda/article32916062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIDEN-TRUMPa,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/final-debate-between-us-president-donald-trump-and-democratic-candidate-joe-biden-in-nashville/article32916064.ece
29,2020/10/22,Pak parliamentary panel approves government’s bill to seek review of Kulbhushan Jadhav’s conviction,"Federal Minister for Law and Justice Farogh Naseem said the bill has been introduced in compliance with directives of the ICJ.

A Pakistani parliamentary panel has approved a government bill that seeks a review of the conviction of death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav, complying with the directives of the International Court of Justice, according to a media report on Thursday.

The draft bill titled the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance was discussed and approved by the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Law and Justice on Wednesday despite stiff resistance from the Opposition.

Also read: Kulbhushan Jadhav coerced into refusing appeal, says India

Taking part in the debate, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Farogh Naseem said the bill has been introduced in compliance with directives of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

He warned that in case the bill was not adopted by Parliament, Pakistan could face sanctions for not complying with the ICJ’s verdict.

Also read: Kulbhushan Jadhav | Pakistan failed to give access, says India

Fifty-year-old retired Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.

In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court.

The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.

However, the committee’s members from the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) requested its chairman Riaz Fatyana to reject the bill, the Dawn reported.

However, Fatyana, who belongs to the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), decided to settle the matter through voting. He also tried to stop two PTI members from leaving the hall before voting.

Eight members voted in favour of the bill, while five opposed it, the report said.

The Opposition members termed the bill as NRO for Jadhav.

The NRO is the National Reconciliation Ordinance which former president and military dictator Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf offered to the-then exiled political leadership and under which several corruption cases against different politicians were dropped.

Aliya Kamran of the JUI-F accused the government of misleading the country’s establishment, saying that they were not here to legislate for Jadhav and the bill should be presented before the public and bar associations for a public debate.

The legislation is unnecessary since the judgement of former chief justice of Pakistan Nasirul Mulk has already said the constitutional courts can review the judgements of the military courts, Mr. Kamran said.

Syed Naveed Qamar of the PPP said that through the legislation, the government was trying to give Jadhav relief of appeal against the sentence of a military court which is not even available to a Pakistani citizen.

This is tantamount to giving an NRO to Jadhav and “we oppose this bill,” he said.

The Law Minister said his ministry had sought to pre-empt a possible Indian move of filing a contempt petition against Pakistan in the ICJ by promulgating the said ordinance.

In such a scenario, the country could face sanctions if the matter was referred to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), he said.

The Minister pointed out that neither India nor Jadhav had filed a petition before the Islamabad High Court to seek relief permissible under the ICJ verdict.

Subsequently, the law ministry had to file a petition for the appointment of a lawyer for Jadhav which is pending adjudication.

A Pakistani court was informed on October 6 that India failed to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav in the case of the review of his death sentence by a military court in this country.

Earlier, Pakistan had again rejected India’s demand that an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel should be appointed for Jadhav to ensure a free and fair trial in the case.

On October 8, India said that Pakistan has failed to address the core issues in Jadhav’s case and pressed for an “unimpeded, unconditional and unhindered” consular access to him as ordered by the ICJ.

“The core issues need to be addressed if we have to have effective review and reconsideration as ordered by the international court of justice. Pakistan must show its intention to deliver on the core issues,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6th8ai/article32915652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KULBHUSHANJADHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pak-parliamentary-panel-approves-governments-bill-to-seek-review-of-kulbhushan-jadhavs-conviction/article32915653.ece
30,2020/10/22,"Sent from Gitmo to UAE, detainees fear final stop","The United Arab Emirates is planning to send 18 former Guantanamo Bay detainees to Yemen, after holding them in custody for five years

The Guantanamo detainees were promised they were being sent to a Muslim country for rehabilitation that would help integrate them into society, opening the way to jobs, money, and marriage, according to their lawyers and families.

It was a lie.

Instead, the detainees -- 18 Yemenis and one Russian, swept up from Afghanistan and Pakistan after the Sept. 11 attacks -- have languished in custody in the United Arab Emirates for as long as five years, their families and lawyers tell .

In short, sporadic phone calls from undisclosed locations in the UAE, including a notorious prison rife with torture, several whispered to their families that as bad as life in Guantanamo was, they wish they could return there.

Now there are plans to send them to Yemen, where their families fear they face treatment that is even worse.

A senior Yemeni government official confirmed the plans, pending security arrangements; a State Department official indicated the U.S. government was aware that it was happening. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The UAE didn’t respond to AP questions.

United Nations rights experts described the men’s upcoming repatriation as a “forced return,” warning that it violates international laws.

Their destination is a poor Arab country wracked by a grinding civil war for the past six years. Torture and arbitrary detention are widespread in networks of secret and formal prisons run by various factions controlling different parts of the country.

The family of one detainee, Salem, said- “We fear they will be gunned down or rounded up as soon as they put a foot in Yemen.”

The lingering confinement of these men violates promises made by U.S. officials when they were sent to the UAE in 2015-17. It underscores flaws in the transfer program and the failure of President Donald Trump’s administration to ensure their humane treatment.

President Barack Obama pressed to close the Guantanamo facility amid opposition from Congress. The plan was to prosecute some detainees and to continue to hold others without charges while carrying review board evaluations. Those who no longer were deemed dangerous were transferred to their homelands or third countries.

Trump had other plans. Before taking office, he declared on Twitter that there would be “no further releases from GITMO.” His administration dismantled an entire office tasked with closing the Guantanamo facility, overseeing transfers, and following up on the resettled detainees.

Terms of the agreements the U.S. struck with the UAE and dozens of other countries that received Guantanamo detainees weren’t made public. But Ian Moss, a former chief of staff for the State Department’s Guantanamo envoy, insisted that, “We wanted these individuals after they were released to have a fresh start in life. It wasn’t part of the deal that they be incarcerated.”

Under Trump, only one prisoner, a Saudi, was transferred to Saudi Arabia to serve the remainder of his sentence after he agreed to a plea bargain.

Under Obama, a total of 197 were transferred to other countries, while 500 were transferred by George W. Bush. The U.S. base now has 40 detainees; most are being held without charges and a third are Yemenis.

Katie Taylor is deputy director of the United Kingdom-based group Reprieve and coordinator of the group’s Life After Guantanamo project. She told the AP that after documenting the lives of nearly 60 former detainees in 25 countries, “I have to say that the situation facing the men resettled in the UAE is among the worst and most troubling.”

It is not clear whether there are now 17 or 18 detainees in UAE hands; unconfirmed reports suggest one Yemeni left prison because of medical complications.

One detainee is represented by lawyer Patricia Bronte. (His name and the full names of all the Yemeni detainees are being withheld for fear that they might face retribution.) She recalled that State Department officials had told her and the detainees that they would be held from six to 12 months in a rehabilitation facility, and then they would be allowed to reunite with their families in the UAE.

""From early on, the assurances I have been given weren’t lived up to,” she said.

She has had no contact with her client since his arrival in the UAE in 2016. Families of the detainees say their communication with their loved ones has been infrequent, and troubling-

--Abdo, 41, told his brother that he spent 70 days in solitary confinement -- blindfolded, handcuffed, and with hands and feet chained to the ground -- upon his arrival. There was no rehabilitation or “de-radicalization sessions,” his brother Ahmed told the AP. Abdo and other detainees moved to a “filthy and dark prison” for 16 months.

""It was just terrible there,” the brother quoted Abdo as saying. He was later moved to al-Razin prison, located nearly 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Dubai, where human rights groups have documented abuses and torture.

In the spring of 2019, Abdo was brought back to the “filthy” prison, where he remains.

The brother quoted Abdo as saying, “It’s not what I thought. I wish I return to Guantanamo ... it’s 1,000 times worse here.” Then the phone call was cut off.

--Rival Mingazov, a former ballet dancer and an ex-member of the military, was the only Russian left in Guantanamo when he was sent to the UAE. He was accused of fighting with the Taliban. A Pentagon profile also alleged that he had links to an Islamic group in Uzbekistan with ties to al-Qaida.

Mingazov’s mother, Zoria Valiullina, said her son wanted to return to Guantanamo. “It’s better there.”

--The family of Abdel-Rab, 44, said he disappeared three years ago after two phone calls during which he complained about conditions, and nervously said, “I am under pressure ... Guantanamo was much better. One billion times.”

The call was cut off; he never called again. His family members said they have no clue if he is alive.

According to records, Abdel-Rab had told interrogators that he worked as a house painter in Yemen before he left for Afghanistan in 2000 to study and teach Quran. He was captured in a crackdown on those suspected of links to al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and landed in Guantanamo in 2002.

In June, a man pretending to be Abdel-Rab called the family. “It wasn’t his voice. He wasn’t the same,” said his brother.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vvuki7/article32915714.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UAEGUANTANAMODETAINEES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sent-from-gitmo-to-uae-detainees-fear-final-stop/article32915559.ece
31,2020/10/22,Thailand lifts emergency decree in bid to calm protests,"Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha went on national television on Wednesday night to appeal to pro-democracy protesters to reduce political tensions

Thailand’s government on Thursday canceled a state of emergency it had declared for Bangkok last week after the embattled prime minister suggested the gesture to cool massive student-led protests seeking democracy reforms.

Watch | What is happening in Thailand?

The revocation of the emergency decree was published in the government gazette, and took effect at noon Thursday.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha went on national television on Wednesday night to appeal to pro-democracy protesters to reduce political tensions and promised to lift the emergency measure.

As he was speaking, protesters marched near Government House, his office, to demand he step down. They also asked for the release of their colleagues who were arrested in connection with earlier protests.

They said that if their demands were not met, they would return in three days.

Read: Editorial | Showdown in Thailand

The protesters are pressing for a more democratic constitution and reforms to the monarchy. The implicit criticism of the royal institution has stirred controversy because it traditionally has been treated as sacrosanct and a pillar of national identity.

Wednesday marked the eighth straight day of demonstrations by a movement that was launched in March. It went into a lull as Thailand dealt with a coronavirus outbreak, and slowly revived in July. In the past week especially, protest have spread to other provinces.

The demonstrations have continued even though many top protest leaders have been detained and the state of emergency banned public gatherings of more than four people.

Mr. Prayuth, in the taped speech, pleaded with his countrymen to resolve their political differences through Parliament.

""The only way to a lasting solution for all sides that is fair for those on the streets as well as for the many millions who choose not to go on the streets is to discuss and resolve these differences through the parliamentary process,” he said, according to an official English-language text of his remarks.

The government on Tuesday approved a request to recall Parliament to deal with the political crisis in a special session from Monday to Wednesday.

""While I can listen to and acknowledge the demands of protesters, I cannot run the country based on protester or mob demands,” Mr. Prayuth said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tcptvv/article32915434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDTHAILAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thailand-cancels-emergency-decree-in-bid-to-calm-protests/article32915435.ece
32,2020/10/22,U.S. to nix business visas for H-1B speciality jobs,"The move is likely to impact several Indian companies which send their technology professionals on B-1 visas for a short stay to complete jobs on site in the U.S.

The State Department has proposed not to issue temporary business visas for H-1B speciality occupations which allowed several companies to send their technology professionals for a short stay to complete jobs on site in the U.S., a move which could affect hundreds of Indians.

The proposal, if finalised, will eliminate any misconception that the “B-1 in lieu of H policy” provides an alternative avenue for foreign professionals to enter the U.S. to perform skilled labour that allows, and potentially even encourages them and their employers to circumvent the restrictions and requirements relating to the H non-immigrant classification established by Congress to protect the U.S. workers, the State Department said.

The move, made public on Wednesday, less than two weeks ahead of the November 3 presidential election, is likely to impact several Indian companies which send their technology professionals on B-1 visas for a short stay to complete jobs on site in the U.S.

On December 17, 2019, the Attorney General of California announced a $800,000 settlement against Infosys Limited to resolve allegations that approximately 500 Infosys employees worked in the state on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas rather than H-1B visas, the State Department said.

“The proposed changes and the resulting transparency would reduce the impact of foreign labour on the U.S. workforce of aliens performing activities in a specialty occupation without the procedural protections attendant to the H-1B classification,” it said.

In its federal notification issued on Wednesday, the State Department said the U.S. architecture firm seeking protection from rising labour costs in the country might believe it could lay off its U.S. architects and contract for the same professional architectural services to be provided by a foreign architecture firm.

If the foreign firm sought H-1B visas for its architects, it would be required to pay the prevailing wage for architects in the area of intended employment in the United States, presumably the same wage the U.S. architects had been paid, and meet the other requirements enacted by the Congress to protect U.S. workers.

But under the B-1 in lieu of H policy, the foreign architects could ostensibly seek B-1 visas and travel to the U.S. to fill a temporary need for architecture services, as long as they retained a residence in the foreign country and continued to receive a salary, perhaps significantly lower than what is customary for U.S. architects, dispersed abroad by the foreign firm (or under the auspices of a foreign parent or subsidiary), the State Department said.

Under the Department’s guidance, visas could be issued for multiple architects planning temporary work in the U.S. in certain situations. However, a foreign employer may succeed in undermining the U.S. immigration law and policy by rotating architects between the U.S. and the foreign country to effectively fill the position of one U.S. architect at a significantly lower cost, the notification said.

“If the architects who intended to perform skilled labour were “of distinguished merit and ability... seeking to perform (temporary architectural services) of an exceptional nature requiring such merit and ability, one might argue the current regulatory language suggests this type of labour is a permissible basis for B-1 non-immigrant visa issuance,” the State Department said.

This potential outcome is harmful to the U.S. workers and contrary to the policies of the Trump administration, it said.

The State Department said the application process for a B-1 visa does not include similar procedural requirements to protect the U.S. workers like that of H-1B visas.

Also, the fees for the B-1 visas are far less than that of H-1B visas.

While Congress required H-1B employers to pay significant fees to fund assistance to the U.S. workforce as well as prevention and detection of fraud related to skilled labour, employers are not required to pay comparable fees to employ skilled workers under the B-1 in lieu of H policy, it said.

According to the notification, the State Department estimates that this proposal will affect not more than 6,000 to 8,000 foreign workers per year, specifically aliens intending to provide services in a specialty occupation in the U.S..

As per its estimate, up to 28% of the approximately 8,000 annual B-1 visa issuances under the B-1 in lieu of H policy were to foreign workers who applied for a visa to perform services in a specialty occupation for a small entity in the U.S.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tczvjf/article32263809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/H1B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-proposes-not-to-issue-business-visa-for-h-1b-speciality-occupations/article32915427.ece
33,2020/10/22,Trump says U.S. has had enough of 19 years in Afghanistan,"The President’s remarks follows his statement early this month that he will bring all troops back from Afghanistan by year-end

The United States has had enough of 19 years in Afghanistan, President Donald Trump has said, reiterating that American troops are coming back from the war-torn country.

Also read: Another Afghan peace push and a role for India

Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he would bring home all the US troops from “endless wars”. It was also one of the promises he made during his 2016 Presidential campaign.

Last month, he said that the United States will reduce the number of its troops in Afghanistan to 4,000 in a very short period of time.

“We never had anything like it -- and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that you’ve never even heard of. And they’re all coming back. You know that, right? I hope nobody objects, “ Mr. Trump told his supporters on Wednesday at an election rally in Gastonia, in the battleground state of North Carolina.

“I think 19 years in Afghanistan is enough, wouldn’t you say? We’re like a police force over there. We have the greatest soldiers in the world, but over there we’re like a police force. 19 years is enough,” he said.

“You think it’s easy getting out with all the military-industrial complex, right? The military -- beware the military-industrial complex. They are right but we are all coming home, they are all coming home,” Mr. Trump said.

Early this month, Mr. Trump announced that he will bring all troops back from Afghanistan by year-end. The Pentagon had expressed surprise over it, while the Taliban had welcomed the move.

The U.S. and the Taliban signed a landmark deal in Doha on February 29 to bring lasting peace in war-torn Afghanistan and allow US troops to return home from America’s longest war.

Under the US-Taliban pact signed in Doha, the US has agreed to reduce its troops in Afghanistan from 13,000 to 8,600 in the next 130 days and withdraw all its soldiers in 14 months.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dn4qn7/article32915314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-says-us-has-had-enough-of-19-years-in-afghanistan/article32915315.ece
34,2020/10/22,US officials link Iran to emails meant to intimidate voters,"“Unlike the U.S., Iran does not interfere in other country’s elections,” Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for Iran’s mission to the United Nations, said.

U.S. officials accused Iran on Wednesday of being behind a flurry of emails sent to Democratic voters in multiple battleground states that appeared to be aimed at intimidating them into voting for President Donald Trump.

The officials did not lay out specific evidence for how they came to pinpoint Iran, but the activities attributed to Tehran would mark a significant escalation for a country some cybersecurity experts regard as a second-rate player in online espionage. The announcement was made at a hastily called news conference 13 days before the election.

The allegations underscored the U.S. government’s concern about efforts by foreign countries to influence the election by spreading false information meant to suppress voter turnout and undermine American confidence in the vote. Such direct attempts to sway public opinion are more commonly associated with Moscow, which conducted a covert social media campaign in 2016 aimed at sowing discord and is again interfering this year, but the idea that Iran could be responsible suggested that those tactics have been adopted by other nations, too.

“These actions are desperate attempts by desperate adversaries,” said John Ratcliffe, the government’s national intelligence director, who, along with FBI Director Chris Wray, insisted the U.S. would impose costs on foreign countries that interfere in the U.S. election and that the integrity of the vote remains sound.

“You should be confident that your vote counts,” Mr. Wray said. “Early, unverified claims to the contrary should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism.”

The two officials called out both Russia and Iran for having obtained voter registration information, though such data is sometimes easily accessible and there was no allegation either country had hacked a database for it. Iran sent spoofed emails designed to intimidate voters and sow unrest and also distributed a video that falsely suggested voters could cast fraudulent ballots from overseas, Ratcliffe said.

Mr. Wray and Mr. Ratcliffe did not describe the emails, but officials familiar with the matter said the U.S. has linked Tehran to messages sent to Democratic voters in at least four states, including battleground locations like Pennsylvania and Florida. The emails falsely purported to be from the far-right group Proud Boys and warned that “we will come after you” if the recipients didn’t vote for Trump.

Though Democratic voters were targetted, Mr. Ratcliffe said the spoofed emails were intended to harm Mr. Trump, though he did not elaborate how. One possibility is the messages may have been intended to align Trump in the minds of voters with the Proud Boys after he was criticised for failing to unequivocally denounce the group during the first presidential debate.

It would not be the first time that the Trump administration has said Tehran is working against the president.

An intelligence assessment in August said- “Iran seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections.” It said the country would probably continue to focus on “spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content.”

Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for Iran’s mission to the United Nations, denied Tehran’s involvement.

“Unlike the U.S., Iran does not interfere in other country’s elections,” Mr. Miryousefi wrote on Twitter. “The world has been witnessing U.S.own desperate public attempts to question the outcome of its own elections at the highest level.”

Mr. Trump, speaking at a rally in North Carolina, made no reference to the intelligence announcement, but repeated a familiar campaign assertion that Iran is opposed to his reelection. He promised that if he wins another term he will reach a new accord with Iran over its nuclear program.

“Iran doesn’t want to let me win. China doesn’t want to let me win,” Mr. Trump said. “The first call I’ll get after we win, the first call I’ll get will be from Iran saying let’s make a deal.”

“We cannot allow voter intimidation or interference efforts, either foreign or domestic, to silence voters’ voices and take away that right,” the they said in a statement.

While state-backed Russian hackers are known to have infiltrated U.S. election infrastructure in 2016, there is no evidence that Iran has ever done so. It was also not clear how officials were able to identify Iran so quickly.

The voter intimidation operation apparently used email addresses obtained from state voter registration lists, which include party affiliation and home addresses and can include email addresses and phone numbers.

Those addresses were then used in an apparently widespread targeted spamming operation. The senders claimed they would know which candidate the recipient was voting for in the Nov. 3 election, for which early voting is ongoing.

Federal officials have long warned about the possibility of this type of operation, as such registration lists are not difficult to obtain.

“These emails are meant to intimidate and undermine American voters’ confidence in our elections,” Christopher Krebs, the top election security official at the Department of Homeland Security, tweeted Tuesday night after reports of the emails first surfaced.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-officials-link-iran-to-emails-meant-to-intimidate-voters/article32915231.ece

36,2020/10/22,"U.S. presidential election 2020 | Back on campaign trail, Obama rips into Trump","With less than two weeks until Election Day, the former President urges Black men not to give into apathy

With less than two weeks to go before Election Day, former U.S. President Barack Obama campaigned in Pennsylvania for his former Vice President and Democratic nominee Joe Biden. At a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, Mr. Obama delivered an impassioned speech, in which he painted a picture of a highly dysfunctional President, Donald Trump, and his failing administration, while he made a character and policy-based case for a Biden-Harris administration. Mr. Obama said Mr. Trump was not interested in the job and was using the presidency as a reality show to get attention.

Also Read Obama emerges as central figure in 2020 presidential race

Mr. Obama criticised Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying at least 2,22,000 Americans had died, millions of jobs were gone and 1,00,000 small business were closed. He compared South Korea and Canada’s handling of the pandemic to the U.S.’, which has been far worse in terms of mortality and infections than the other two countries in question.

“Donald Trump wants to take full credit for the economy he inherited and no responsibility for the pandemic he ignored,” Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama took a shot at Mr. Trump for having a bank account in China. The New York Times had reported earlier this week that Trump International Hotels operated an account in the country.

“We know that he continues to do business with China because he's got a secret Chinese bank account. How is that possible? How is that possible?,” Mr .Obama said. [The bank account is not technically “secret” as the New York Times reported it had got the information from an analysis of Mr. Trump’s tax records].

“Listen, can you imagine if I had had a secret Chinese bank account when I was running for re-election? You think Fox News might have been a little concerned about that? They would've called me ‘Beijing Barry’,” Mr. Obama told the audience at the rally.

Mr. Obama vouched for Mr. Biden’s character, saying he had empathy and decency. He criticised the Republicans for repealing and not replacing the Affordable Care Act ( “Obamacare”) and said Mr. Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris would expand Medicare (public health insurance) and create green jobs as part of Mr. Biden’s $ 2 trillion climate plan.

Mr. Obama kept returning to the theme of the President’s conduct.

“With Joe and Kamala at the helm, you're not going to have to think about the crazy things they said every day. And that's worth a lot,” Mr. Obama said.

“You're not going to have to argue about them every day. It just won't be so exhausting. You, you might be able to have a Thanksgiving dinner without having an argument. You'll be able to go about your lives, knowing that the President is not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or that Navy Seals didn't actually kill Bin Laden. Think about that, the President of the United States retweeted that,” he said referring to a bizarre conspiracy theory that Mr. Trump had retweeted, according to which Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden had U.S. soldiers killed to cover up a plot related to Osama Bin Laden.

Mr. Obama said that with a Biden-Harris administration, the country would not have to deal with a President who insulted or threatened people who disagreed with him.

“We wouldn't tolerate it from a high school principal. We wouldn't tolerate it from a coach. We wouldn't tolerate it from a co-worker. We wouldn't tolerate it in our own family, except for maybe crazy uncle somewhere, you know?” he said, asking why folks were making excuses for Mr. Trump’s conduct.

“There are consequences to these actions,” Mr. Obama said animatedly. “They embolden other people to be cruel and divisive and racist and it frays the fabric of our society. And it affects how our children see things. And it affects the ways that our families get along. It affects how the world looks at America,” he said.

“That behaviour matters. Character matters.”

Mr. Obama urged people to vote, and said that he did not care about the polls because the polls had got the results wrong in 2016 presidential elections. Mr. Biden is leading nationally and in Pennsylvania as per polls.

The former President said America was a “good and decent place” and asked people to trust Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris to “lead this country out of these dark times.”

“Honk if you’re fired up, honk if you’re ready to go,” Mr. Obama said to the drive-in rally attendees who responded by honking.

37,2020/10/22,Coronavirus | Spain becomes first Western European nation to top 1 million COVID-19 cases,"Health Ministry data showed total cases had reached 1,005,295, rising by 16,973 from the previous day

Spain became the first Western European country to exceed 1 million coronavirus infections on Wednesday, doubling its tally in just six weeks despite a series of increasingly stringent measures to control the second wave.

Health Ministry data showed total cases had reached 1,005,295, rising by 16,973 from the previous day. The death toll increased by 156 to 34,366.

After slowing to a trickle in the wake of Spain's strict March to June lockdown, the infection rate accelerated to frequently exceed 10,000 cases a day from late August, and hit a new peak of more than 16,000 last week.

A hurried exit from confinement before tracing systems were in place let transmission get out of hand faster than in other countries, said Dr. Rafael Bengoa, co-founder of Bilbao's Institute for Health and Strategy.

He also blamed Spain's deeply entrenched political polarisation for the rise. “There's a lot of political noise but a shocking leadership vacuum,” he said.

As Spain's health ministry released the latest figures, most of its lawmakers were bitterly debating a motion of no confidence in Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez launched by the far-right Vox party

“These politicians are only comfortable with the simplicity of short-term... ideologically motivated debates, but the virus doesn't care about ideology,” Bengoa said.

While daily deaths have been hovering around 100 - a far cry from the peak of nearly 900 registered in late March - nationwide hospital admissions have jumped 20% in two weeks and 70% in Catalonia.

That may potentially force some Barcelona hospitals to suspend non-urgent procedures.

Desperate to avoid a repeat of the first wave, when the virus ravaged Spain's elderly population and brought the health service to its knees, several regions have toughened restrictions in the past weeks.

The tiny wine-producing region of La Rioja joined nearby Navarre in announcing a blanket ban for all non-essential travel to and from the area.

The government is also contemplating curfews for the worst-hit areas, including Madrid, where a two-week state of emergency is due to expire on Saturday.

But conservative regional leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso, who has regularly locked horns with the left-wing government, said she would prefer more “surgical measures” that do not penalise businesses.

“What's most important is that the economy doesn't suffer any more,” she told a news conference on Wednesday.

Neighbouring France has more than 900,000 cases and could also surpass 1 million this week, though its population is around 40% larger than Spain's.

Both Britain and Italy have reported more deaths than Spain, but fewer overall infections.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/obvoej/article31435215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSSPAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-spain-becomes-first-western-european-nation-to-top-1-million-covid-19-cases/article32914217.ece
38,2020/10/22,Maldives major seizures put drug enforcement agencies on alert,"Efforts on to decide if drugs are being pushed into India too, says Customs official

Drug enforcement agencies have taken note of some major seizures, involving about 200 kg of drugs, made in the Maldives in the past few weeks. Among those detained were four Pakistani nationals, who allegedly operated as couriers.

They were arrested in September second week after they reached Maldives by flight on the charge of possession of drugs. A Kenyan national was also arrested on the same charge.

In another case reported on October 3, the Maldives police seized 98.60 kg of drugs in Addu City and arrested over a dozen suspects. The drugs were in the form of heroin, amphetamines and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).

The contraband was being smuggled through the sea route in conspiracy with international drug traffickers, suspected to have links in Pakistan.

About 100 kg of drugs, including heroin and methamphetamine, were seized from a boat in Hulhumale on October 12.

A transit point?

“Tourism in Maldives has been severely hit in the past few months due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, therefore, we suspect that local drugs consumption has also gone down significantly. However, drugs in large quantities are still landing there, raising suspicion that international syndicates may also be using Maldives as a transit point for other destinations,” said a Customs official.

Efforts were on to determine if drugs were being diverted to India too. “There have been innumerable instances of drugs being pushed into the country through transit points overseas, by land, air or through maritime routes. Earlier this year, the Narcotics Control Bureau arrested two women from Mozambique with about 10 kg of heroin at the Delhi airport,” said the official.

In the same case, an Ivory Coast national was arrested in Greater Noida with over 4 kg of the stuff. The seized drugs were suspected to be part of a larger consignment first smuggled to Mozambique via Pakistan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/maldives-major-seizures-put-drug-enforcement-agencies-on-alert/article32913335.ece
39,2020/10/22,Coronavirus | Brazil's Bolsonaro rejects plan to buy China's Sinovac vaccine; Health Minister tests positive,"On Tuesday, Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said in a meeting with state governors that the Ministry would buy the Sinovac vaccine

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro and a high-ranking health official said on Wednesday the federal government will not buy a COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinovac, one day after the Health Minister said it would be included in the nation's immunization program.

The apparent about-face, following anti-China social media commentary by some of Mr. Bolsonaro's supporters, thrust into the open a simmering debate over vaccine policy between the president and key governors, who have been exploring alternatives to the AstraZeneca vaccine the federal government has prioritized.

On Tuesday, Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said in a meeting with state governors that the Ministry would buy the Sinovac vaccine to include in the immunization program, along with AstraZeneca's vaccine developed with Oxford University. That inclusion would be contingent on approval by drug regulator Anvisa, he said.

The Health Ministry on Wednesday announced that Mr. Pazuello has tested positive for the virus, making him the latest Brazilian official, including Bolsonaro, to do so.

Sao Paulo state biomedical research center, the Butantan Institute, is testing the Sinovac vaccine, and Governor Joŗo Doria said he hopes to have regulatory approval by the end of the year to start vaccinating people in January.

But Mr. Bolsonaro said on Wednesday, Mr. Pazuello had been misinterpreted during the meeting with Brazil's governors.

“For sure, we will not buy the Chinese vaccine,” Mr. Bolsonaro said on social media, responding to a supporter who urged him not to buy the vaccine.

Later in the morning, Health Ministry official Elcio Franco said all vaccines would be forced to go through federal health approval channels, but that the government had no interest in ”Chinese vaccines.”

Mr. Doria, who announced on Tuesday that the federal government had agreed to buy 46 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine, took exception to that stance on Wednesday.

“The vaccine is what is going to save us, save us all,” he told reporters.

“It's not ideology, it's not politics, it's not an election that will save us. It's the vaccine,” added Doria, who is viewed as a potential opponent for Bolsonaro in 2022 presidential elections.

Brazil has been among the world's hardest hit nations by the pandemic, with more than 5 million infections and nearly 155,000 COVID-19 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.

The inclusion of the vaccine, called CoronaVac, in the national vaccination program of a nation of 230 million people would be a major success for Sinovac in what could be one of the world's first immunization efforts against the coronavirus.

The Brazilian government already has plans to purchase the AstraZeneca vaccine and produce it at its biomedical research center FioCruz in Rio de Janeiro.

The Butantan Institute said on Monday that preliminary results from late-stage clinical trials of CoronaVac on 9,000 volunteers have proven that the two-dose Chinese vaccine is safe. Butantan director Dimas Covas said efficacy data will not be released until trials are completed.

Mr. Bolsonaro, a far-right leader who has drawn close to U.S. President Donald Trump, has made disparaging remarks about China in the past, even though it is Brazil's largest trade partner.

“The vaccine belongs to India and not the BJP. The politicisation of the vaccine proves that they have no other option except to sell the fear of disease and death. Biharis have self respect and they won’t sell the future of their children for a few rupees.” the RJD’s official handle tweeted.

Using a video clip of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s comment at the BJP’s Bihar manifesto release event, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said, “You vote for me and I will give vaccine.... what appalling cynicism! Will the Election Commission rap her & her shameless Govt on the knuckles?”

As the issue snowballed into a major controversy, senior BJP leader Bhupender Yadav stepped in and accused Mr. Tharoor of twisting Ms. Sitharaman’s statement. “Your attempt to twist Smt Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement reeks of desperation. All parties issue manifestos. Vaccines will be made available to all Indians at nominal costs. States can make it free. In #Bihar, we will,” Mr. Yadav said.

Free, universal regimes

The Congress’s official twitter handle pointed out that every major vaccination programme, from small pox to polio, has been free in India over the years, and asked if the BJP government intends to reverse the policy.

While National Conference leader Omar Abdullah called the BJP’s statement a case of “blatant populism that shamefully expoits COVID fears”, Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav called it “opportunistic politics”.

41,2020/10/22,"Bihar Assembly election: BJP’s 19 lakh jobs promise ‘gimmick’, says Congress","What happened to PM Modi’s 2 crore jobs a year assurance, asks Congress

The Congress on October 22 heaped scorn on the BJP for promising 19 lakh jobs in Bihar and a two-fold rise in the State’s GDP over the next five years, and wanted to know what happened to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of providing “two crore jobs a year”.

AICC general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala hit out at Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who released the BJP’s manifesto for Assembly elections earlier in the day, saying, “What do we make of claims about GDP made by a woman under whom the country’s growth rate has nosedived from 10% to minus 23%.”

The Congress leader, at a press conference in Patna, sought to embarrass the NDA, which rules the Centre as well as the State, by playing video clips of the Prime Minister and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar launching blistering attacks on each other.

The JD(U) chief, who is running for his fourth consecutive term in power, had won the 2015 Assembly elections as the chief ministerial candidate of the Grand Alliance which included the Congress and Lalu Prasad’s RJD.

“The BJP manifesto is full of gimmicks and comes nowhere close to ours released the day before. Instead of coming out with yet another jumla [gimmick] of 19 lakh jobs, the BJP would have done better by stating what came of the promise made by Modi before the 2014 general elections to provide 2 crore jobs per year,” Mr. Surjewala said.

“Had they been able to deliver on their promises, 12 crore people would have got employment across the country in the last six years. Bihar too would have benefited in due course. But since they have failed, they cannot be trusted anymore,” he said.

The Congress leader alleged the JD(U)-BJP combine has driven the State to the “brink of ruin” (badhaali ke kaggar par) in the last 15 years and said Mr. Kumar, who is called “sushasan babu” for his claims of ushering in good governance deserved the epithet “phisaddi babu” (laggard).

“It is not just we who say that Nitish Kumar has been a non-performer. A recent report of the Niti Aayog, which functions under the Modi government at the Centre, speaks volumes about the woeful situation of Bihar where students’ dropout rate is high, the number of qualified teachers is low, malnutrition exists on an alarming scale.

“Who else is responsible for the pathetic situation other than Nitish Kumar and Modi? The State has also suffered on account of the Centre’s indifference under Modi which the CM used to speak about earlier but now cannot since he is shackled [bediyon mein hain — an allusion to the tie-up with BJP],” the Congress leader said.

Mr. Surjewala said he always had respect for Mr. Nitish Kumar but was saddened upon seeing the JD(U) national president losing his cool at a rally on the previous day where he “asked young protesters to get out”.

The AICC general secretary was referring to a rally in Parsa seat where the JD(U) has fielded Chandrika Roy, the turncoat from RJD whose daughter Aishwarya is the estranged wife of Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav.

Mr. Kumar lost his cool when slogans were raised by a group of supporters of Chhote Lal Rai, who had won Parsa for JD(U) twice but quit the party unhappy over Ms. Chandrika Roy’s induction and is now in the fray as the RJD candidate.

“You people must leave if you do not want to listen. You need not vote for me. But do remember you will end up harming the prospects of the one who has sent you. He was with us till recently and ran away to the other side,” said a visibly irritated Mr. Kumar.

A stickler for propriety in public who rarely drags private affairs into political discourse, Mr. Kumar, who was annoyed by the episode, turned towards Ms. Chandrika Roy and Ms. Aishwarya who were seated on the dais and exclaimed, “What insults were heaped on this educated girl. Nature will make them [Lalu family] pay for their sins.”

“Nitish Kumar ji, you are on your way out. But please do not give vent to your frustration in this manner just because you are staring at a loss of power,” Mr. Surjewala added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/7a9i4s/article32919379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-SURJEWALA-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-election-bjps-19-lakh-jobs-promise-gimmick-says-congress/article32919380.ece

Senior RJD leader and party spokesperson Manoj K Jha speaks to The Hindu on the electoral prospects of the party, Tejashwi Yadav’s rallies and the burden of the 15-year Lalu-Rabri regime that the party carries.

The opinion polls have suggested that the RJD-Congress-Left combine lags behind the NDA in the upcoming Assembly elections in Bihar. Your comments.

I would just say they should check their opinion polls of 2015 also. I know their compulsions and I know the pressures under which they work. I know the mandate given to them by their top bosses — opinion polls are more often than not are opinionated polls.

Across Bihar, Tejashwiji is drawing an interactive crowd. These are not just limited to Muslims and Yadavs. Look at the areas where the rallies were held — Aurangabad, Goh, Taimur, Magadh, Aliganj… it is a mixed crowd. I have not seen such an enthusiastic and interactive crowd in recent times.

Bihar CM and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar in almost every rally of his is invoking the “jungle raj” during the 15-year Lalu-Rabri rule. Is that why the RJD has removed Laluji’s and Rabriji’s pictures from its posters?

I give you a task — compare NCRB data 1990 to 2005 and subsequently 2005-2020. The data for the two periods whether it is kidnapping or dacoity is not different. Story lies in the data, not only what one says. I have seen an unprecedented degeneration in the language employed by Mr. Nitish Kumar, our honourable Chief Minister. He addresses Tejashwi “karta hai, bolta hai”. This is not the language of Bihar. Across all regions people in Bihar will differ with each other fundamentally, but they will never employ such derogatory language. I don’t know what happened to him. If there were 15-years of Jungle Raj under Lalu and Rabriji then in 2015, why did you have an alliance with the RJD. Why did you come to us? He became Chief Minister in 2015 with our support. I never thought he could reach such a level of decay.

No, no way. It is the other way round. They chose their own trajectory, I wish them well. I would say, very frankly, with conviction, the fight is between the RJD alliance and the BJP and on certain seats with the LJP. There is virtually no fight with the JD(U).

The Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday released its manifesto for the Assembly polls in Bihar with the first promise in it being free distribution of vaccine against COVID-19 once it is approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

The announcement led to a storm of criticism of the BJP over social media by opposition leaders who felt that promising free vaccines as an election promise during a pandemic was morally questionable. At this, senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav clarified over Twitter. Responding to Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, Mr Yadav tweeted: “Your attempt to twist Smt Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement reeks of desperation. All parties issue manifestos. Vaccines will be made available to all Indians at nominal costs. States can make it free. In Bihar, we will”.



BJP information technology cell chief Amit Malviya offered more clarifications. “Like all programmes, Centre will provide vaccines to states at a nominal rate. It is for state Governments to decide if they want to give it free or otherwise. Health being a state subject, Bihar BJP has decided to give it free,” he said.

The manifesto also promised 19 lakh jobs in the next five years, including the appointment of three lakh teachers within the next year in schools and higher education institutions and one lakh jobs in the health sector.

Jobs has become a major issue in these elections with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejaswi Yadav promising that his first act, on being elected to power, would be to create 10 lakh jobs.

A promise to construct 30 lakh pucca houses for the poor was also made. Special emphasis would be given to the information technology sector, as well as the establishment of 13 food processing parks.

45,2020/10/22,Online Puja celebrations for Bengali community in Thiruvananthapuram,"In its golden jubilee year, Trivandrum Bengalee Association plans to stream pujas, cultural programmes and competitions in connection with the annual Durga Puja festivities

Durga Puja celebrations of the Bengali community in Thiruvananthapuram is taking the digital route this year. The biggest event of the community, which usually features community pujas, cultural programmes and food festivals, is going online this year. Coordinating the events, as always, is the Trivandrum Bengalee Association (TBA).

“It is the golden jubilee year of our Durga Puja celebrations in Thiruvananthapuram and it is disappointing that we can’t have a grand event. But, in the current scenario, this is the best we can do. This is the new normal,” says Kaustabh Kumar Maiti, president, TBA.

The online programme from October 23 to 26 is observed as Maha Saptami, Maha Ashtami, Maha Navami and Vijaya Dashami. Usually artisans are brought from West Bengal to make the idols of Durga. But the pandemic ruled out that possibility. “Pujas will be held on a small scale at the house of a senior member of the TBA, in the morning and evening. That will be streamed on our website and our WhatsApp group,” he adds.

Cultural programmes put up by the members of the TBA are a highlight every year. This year, dance, music, drama and recitation will be recorded events and competitions for children in categories such as singing, drawing, essay writing and recitation will be held live. Instead of inter-school quiz competition, they are holding a quiz session open for members of all ages of the TBA. However, the members have decided to give the food festival a miss.

Curtains up

“Children and elders put up separate plays always and we didn’t want to skip that. The children’s play is Aban Jalpan, a work by Sukumar Ray, Satyajit Ray’s father. It is a drama in the form of poetry and talks about a man going in search of water. The child actors, five of them, recorded their dialogues from their homes, with their mothers helping them out. The presentation will be a mix of audio and video. The children are between the ages of four and 13,” says Maitrali Maiti, joint cultural secretary of TBA.

Meanwhile the elders’ play is a radio drama, Vivah Viched (Divorce), a comedy written by Nirup Mitra. “We had to go for a play with minimum characters since all the actors had to record dialogues separately. This one has four actors. The audio files, over 200 of them, were later merged to form the play,” says Samir Das, coordinator of the play.

The TBA, now associated with Bharat Bhavan, was formed in 1971 and registered in 1994. It was the setting up Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) that brought many Bengalis to the city. Now over 80 families are members of TBA, with some of them living in the city for more than 45 years. While employees of VSSC continue to form a major chunk of TBA, some of the members work in public and private sector institutions in the capital city.

“Durga Puja is what every Bengali in the city looks forward to. It is a time for all of us to come together. Bengalis who are not members of TBA also used to turn up at the TBA’s programme at Hassan Marikkar Hall. We had employees from Technopark coming in buses,” says Sudipta Sarkar, secretary, TBA, and a resident of the city for the last 15 years.

The online celebration will be inaugurated by VK Ramachandran, vice-chairman, Kerala State Planning Board, October 23 at 6.30 pm.

46,2020/10/22,The cult of food,"With the pandemic lockdown has come a deluge of debate on the authenticity of food

The pandemic, social distancing and lockdown set off two distinct food trends on social media. The first was recipes that minimised waste and the second, traditional recipes. The trend on minimising waste seems to be fading off a bit; but social media is still abuzz with traditional recipes as we struggle to find comfort in food that is close to our roots, food that stokes familial memories during this time of social isolation. What came along with the deluge of traditional food was the debate on authenticity. While the lockdown might have given us some headspace to engage with it, we can safely say that the debate on the authenticity of food will outlast these times.

Authenticity has become both a hallmark and bane for several people involved with documenting food, especially recipes. In the world of quick social media gratification and instant Google research, authenticity has been used for quick personal gains. A few months ago, Kolkata-based food blogger Anindya S. Basu shared a very topical article in the Wall Street Journal titled ‘The Misguided Obsession With ‘Authentic’ Food’. This then led to a prolonged discussion about food, documentation and the authenticity of recipes. A few months down the line, and a pandemic later, I am still having the same discussion, with Anindya and other friends who research, write or blog about food.

Suspended in time

The WSJ article, said: “The cult of authenticity is based on the idea that recipes are suspended in time and place, like berries in an old-fashioned Jell-O mould.” It is one of those lines that you read and think, “Damn! I wish I had written that!” I love the analogy and like this coinage of cult of authenticity. I, however, politely disagree with the writer’s “hope” that “on the way out is the insistence on ‘authenticity’.”

It is absolutely beyond doubt that our exposure changes with every generation; more rapidly in today’s hyper-connected world. And with that changes our outlook, aspirations, taste and resource availability. The same applies to food, and every generation cooks and eats differently, changing the cookbook. Somehow the more we change, the more we remain the same. The debate or insistence on authenticity is therefore more complex and needs to be understood in relation to identity, and nostalgia. Trying to resolve it with “Modern apples tend to be sweeter than older varieties, so to make an apple pie that tastes authentically like one of the 1950s, you would need to use less sugar,” is a tad too simplistic.

The insistence on authenticity is both proactive and reactive to the sense of identity and the emotion of nostalgia. It is perhaps as old as civilisation. Logical as it is that food and recipes continuously evolve based on “ingredients and resources available and the tastes of the times,” it is also true that the will or desire to retain authenticity has remained. Penning cookbooks can partly be attributed to this desire. Or holding on to recipes as family heirlooms.

In the larger context, it gets influenced by questions such as: How strong is the sense of identity of the collective? How much does it feel threatened? How does identity assess its bargaining power? These questions are all deeply political and economic but manifest in everyday social life through various markers of identity. One of the strongest being food.

Personal emotion

Then there is the more personal emotion or that of a smaller collective, especially in cases of food — nostalgia. Authenticity, in such cases, gets shaped by how far in time our comforting nostalgia takes us. ‘My grandmother was extremely loving and she made this daal in the most authentic way!’ These words often get spoken together and that then becomes a benchmark for authenticity.

Nostalgia is deeply intertwined with sense of personal identity. The older we grow, the more unsettled or troubled we feel, the more nostalgic we become in a bid to hold on to our original, unadulterated identities despite the strong winds of time, jobs, families and all other variables that growing up brings with itself. Often, the steeper the obstacles we face, the deeper is the nostalgia and the stronger our attempt to hold on to our identities.

This is very evident in displaced, war torn, asylum-seeking and new migrant communities. This is the reason several charities and social enterprises across the world are using food and cooking skills to help refugees rehabilitate, fight trauma and form new networks. As a Syrian refugee at a refugee food festival held in Paris in 2016 put it, “People see refugees as numbers, but each person has a dream, a story, a family, a life.” Or as we hear personal anecdote of families forced by the lockdown to receive ration from government or benevolent donors ask for familiar food — like rice being preferred by families from east in place of the government ration of wheat. Here, food and the sense of authenticity linked to it becomes extremely important for the person or the community. It becomes a means of stability, assertion and a political currency. Here authenticity is reactive to the threat to self, stability and identity.

The bid of authenticity in food, however, can also be extremely proactive: in India, for instance, the Brahminical insistence on asserting that the vegetarian diet is the ‘authentic’ diet of the country or a family or a temple claiming their cooking method or recipe is authentic even if facts points otherwise. These come with a stronger bargaining chip, and an attempt at exclusion. They also come from a sense of threat to identity, no matter now imagined.

The cult of authenticity of food thus forms the bridge between what is deeply personal and acutely political. To oversimplify it or to deny it completely would be to deny nostalgia and overlook politics.

To say that evolution of recipes is linked solely to availability, especially in today’s globalised world, is myopic. It is an expression of creativity, an indicator of aspiration and assimilation, and a benchmark of how wide your window to the world is. I would say, in varied degrees, it was always so. What has changed is the pace at which the evolution is happening, owing to efficient global value chains, movement of people and technology. All these have brought the world closer, put it in a jar and given it a good shake, mixing our identities, cultures and foods. In that mix have also entered elements of subversion, misinformation and appropriation.

A shaking up

As the world becomes more and more connected, the logic that exposes the datedness and often farcical nature of authenticity of recipes becomes more and more evident. At the same time, as identities are threatened and diluted in an increasingly polarised and defensive world, the desire to prove authenticity of recipes also gets stronger. As has been the case during this pandemic and lockdown, when social interactions that we have always taken for granted has been shaken up, making us reach for roots, comfort, nostalgia and authenticity.

Quoting American author Jonathan Safran Foer, “Food is not rational. Food is culture, habit, craving and identity.” So no matter how patronising, irritating and illogical it is to some, the cult of authenticity is here to stay. All we can hope for is that the right credit goes to the right people and that it unites a fractured world.

51,2020/10/22,Global CXOs rapidly accelerating digital transformation due to COVID-19: IBM,"A new IBM study of global C-Suite executives revealed that nearly six in ten Indian organisations have accelerated their digital transformations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, 66% of executives surveyed said they have completed initiatives that previously encountered resistance while 55% of them plan to increase their prioritistion of digital transformation efforts over the next two years, said IBM on Thursday.

The IBM Institute for Business Value study “COVID-19 and the Future of Business,” includes input from more than 3,800 C-Suite executives in 20 countries and 22 industries, including 172 executives from India.

During the pandemic, traditional and perceived barriers to digital transformation like technology immaturity and employee opposition to change have fallen away. Now, executives see organisational complexity, inadequate skills and employee burnout as the biggest hurdles to overcome — both today and in the next two years.

The study shows that over the next two years, most executives plan to focus on internal and operational capabilities, such as increasing prioritization of workforce skills and flexibility – critical areas to address in order to jumpstart progress.

“In the last few months, we have witnessed year-long digital transformation and adaption compressed into weeks. Companies in every industry have been encouraged to initiate digitisation measures, propelled by the infusion of automation and AI, and look forward to building cognitive enterprises of the future,” said Kamal Singhani, Country Managing Partner, Global Business Services, IBM India/South Asia.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/global-cxos-rapidly-accelerating-digital-transformation-due-to-covid-19-ibm/article32921414.ece

55,2020/10/22,"‘In order to export, you have to import’: Raghuram Rajan cautions against import substitution","The former RBI Governor said that targeted spending by the government can be fruitful in the longer term.

Former Reserve Bank governor Raghuram Rajan on Wednesday cautioned against import substitution under the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative of the government, saying the country has gone down this route earlier but could not succeed.

“If the focus (under Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative) is on import substitution by erecting tariffs, which we have done lot of in the last few years, then I think it is a direction we have tried before and it has failed. I would caution against going in that direction,” Mr. Rajan said.

He was addressing a webinar organised by the Centre for Financial Studies at Bhavan’s SPJIMR.

Mr. Rajan said in order to export, one needs to be able to import things that go into those exports as cheaply as it can.

“China’s rise as an export power came on the back of assembly. It brought in the stuff, put it together and exported it out. In order to export, you have to import. Don’t erect huge tariffs and focus on creating right environment for production in India,” he said.

According to Mr. Rajan, targeted spending by the government can be fruitful in the longer term.

“I think it is good to keep an eye on the overall spending and to be careful. This is not the time to have a free cheque book. But targeted spending can repay a lot if it is done wisely and carefully,” he said.

He further said the country’s growth has been significantly hit but it is more important to understand the consequences of that slowdown on the economic system.

“If a number of firms have shut down never to reopen again, the supply side of the economy is affected. If a number of households have stopped sending their kids to school because they can’t afford to do so, that again inhibits our growth potential for the future as these are going to be poorly educated kids who are going to be capable of much less quality jobs,” he stated.

He said reforms undertaken by identification of real problems are good but the process needs to have consensus of all stakeholders.

“People, critics, opposition parties have some ideas and if you could build more consensus in them... you make sure they are rolled out in a more effective way. I am not saying one needs to debate forever... but it is important in a democracy to build that consensus,” he emphasised.

Mr. Rajan said one big impediment to infrastructure development is the land acquisition process and that requires some technical changes, including better land mapping and clearer ownership.

“Some States have moved ahead on this but we need to move ahead across the board,” he pointed out.

Mr. Rajan also said fixing the financial system is another area where the country needs to improve and there should be a steady process for reforming the sector.

“It is pathetic that at 50% credit to GDP, we still don’t have a healthy financial system. We are failing both in quantity as well as in quality,” he said.

Mr. Rajan said retail inflation at 7.34% in September is on the higher side.

“How much of that is temporary and how much of that is longer term is hard to understand and which is why I think the RBI is in wait-and-watch mode,” he said.

Asked about the monetary policy, Mr. Rajan said he does not want to opine on future RBI policy, but added that it is very accommodative.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ov839k/article32914569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKGLOBAL-CENBANKPOLICYMAKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/in-order-to-export-you-have-to-import-raghuram-rajan-cautions-against-import-substitution/article32914570.ece
56,2020/10/22,India recorded export growth of 4% in September: UNCTAD,"The UN trade and development body expects the value of global trade to contract by 7 per cent to 9 per cent with respect to 2019.

Export growth declined in India in the third quarter of 2020 relative to the same quarter last year but picked up pace in September, according to a global trade update by the UN.

The UNCTAD’s new global trade update said that global trade recorded a 5 per cent drop in the third quarter of 2020 compared with the same period last year. This marks an improvement on the 19 per cent year-on-year plunge recorded in the second quarter, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) expects the frail recovery to continue in the fourth quarter.

India’s export growth saw a decline of 6.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to third quarter of last year. However India recorded export growth of four per cent in September, it said.

Depending on how the COVID-19 pandemic evolves in the winter months, the UN trade and development body expects the value of global trade to contract by 7 per cent to 9 per cent with respect to 2019.

“The uncertain course of the pandemic will continue aggravating trade prospects in the coming months,” UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said.

Read: Editorial on India’s trade amid the pandemic: Export blocks

“Despite some ‘green shoots’ we can’t rule out a slowdown in production in certain regions or sudden increases in restrictive policies.”

Although a 7 per cent to 9 per cent decrease would be a negative finish for the year, Mr. Kituyi said it’s a much more positive result than was expected in June, when the UNCTAD had projected a 20 per cent year-on-year drop for 2020.

Since then, trade trends have improved primarily thanks to the earlier-than-expected resumption of economic activities in Europe and east Asia, it said.

The UNCTAD said the sharp and widespread decline in international trade in Q2 2020 was similar for developing and developed countries. But exports from developing economies appear to be recovering faster.

Year-on-year growth of developing nations’ exports improved from -17 per cent in the second quarter to -6 per cent in July, while those from developed nations increased from -22 per cent to -14 per cent. South-South trade — commerce among developing countries — has shown some resilience, with the year-on-year decline sitting at 8 per cent in July, up from 16 per cent in the second quarter.

The report’s assessment of trade in different sectors said that the pandemic has hit the energy and automotive industries the hardest, while mitigation responses including teleworking and personal protection measures have led to strong growth in sectors such as communication equipment, office machinery, and textiles and apparel.

Watch | What is PPE?

UNCTAD’s analysis gives special attention to COVID-19 medical supplies, which include personal protective equipment, disinfectants, diagnostic kits, oxygen respirators and other related hospital equipment.

According to the report, exports of COVID-19 medical supplies from China, the European Union and the United States rose from about USD 25 billion to USD 45 billion per month between January and May 2020.

The increase in such trade, however, has primarily benefited wealthier nations, with middle- and low-income countries largely priced out from access to COVID-19 supplies, the report says.

The UNCTAD warns that if a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, the access divide between residents in wealthy and poor countries could be even more drastic.

While some low-income countries have the capacity to locally manufacture some protective equipment, this may not be the case for vaccines, which require stronger manufacturing and logistics capacities.

The report calls on governments, the private sector and philanthropic sources to continue mobilizing additional funds to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries and to support financial mechanisms, such as the global COVAX initiative, to provide safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mwms2k/article32797107.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08VJCOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-recorded-export-growth-of-4-in-september-unctad/article32914365.ece
57,2020/10/22,HC stays proceedings against Arun Shourie in disinvestment case,"The Rajasthan High Court on Thursday stayed the proceedings in a trial court against former Union Minister Arun Shourie and four others in a case registered over the disinvestment of an India Tourism Development Corporation-owned hotel in Udaipur in 2002. The special CBI court in Jodhpur had last month ordered reopening of the CBI probe into the matter.

While passing the interim direction, Justice Vijay Bishnoi at the High Court’s principal seat in Jodhpur summoned the records of the case from the special court and asked it not to proceed against the five petitioners till further orders.

Besides Mr. Shourie, others against whom the trial court had ordered registration of a new FIR were then Disinvestment Secretary Pradip Baijal, valuer Kantilal Karamsey, Bharat Hotels Director Jyotsna Suri and Lazard India Managing Director Ashish Guha.

The Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel in Udaipur was sold for ₹7.52 crore when Mr. Shourie was the Minister in charge of disinvestment in the NDA government at the Centre. During a preliminary investigation by the CBI, the property was valued at 252 crore, suggesting a loss of ₹244 crore to the exchequer. The CBI later filed a closure report in the matter.

The counsel for the five petitioners, who challenged the special CBI court’s order and arrest warrants, appeared in the High Court through video conferencing. While Mr. Shourie said the trial court had made certain observations against him without giving him a hearing, others contended that they could not be accused of being involved in a crime on the basis of the material collected by the CBI.

Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju said the CBI had filed closure reports twice in the matter with detailed reasons on why no offence was made out and contended that the trial court’s order was not in conformity with law. The High Court had earlier put on hold arrest warrants against all the petitioners as well as the trial court’s order to the Udaipur district administration to take over the hotel.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x6tlb5/article32922351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGMARUNSHOURIE2766488f,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hc-stays-proceedings-against-arun-shourie-in-disinvestment-case/article32922348.ece

59,2020/10/22,Sole evidence of sexual offence victim is enough for conviction: Supreme Court,"Court confirms sentence for assault of 13-year-old.

The sole and trustworthy evidence of a woman, who is a victim of a sexual offence, is enough to find her assailant guilty, the Supreme Court has held.

“A woman, who is the victim of sexual assault, is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person’s lust and, therefore, her evidence need not be tested with the same amount of suspicion as that of an accomplice,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan observed.

Also read | Sexual offence cases not being probed in stipulated time: Report

The court was confirming the punishment awarded to a man found guilty under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old child in Tamil Nadu. The Madras High Court had upheld the trial verdict of guilt. The verdict was based on the evidence of the victim though her mother had turned hostile.

Justice M.R. Shah drew attention to the long train of judicial precedents from the apex court which have all held that “evidence of the victim of sexual assault is enough for conviction” in a sexual offence case unless there are serious contradictions. Cases of violence against women should be treated with “utmost sensitivity”. Minor contradictions in her testimony should not derail an otherwise water-tight case.

Comment | Putting victims on trial

The rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female, Justice Shah quoted from a past verdict.

“The Third India-U.S. 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue will entail a comprehensive discussion on cross-cutting bilateral issues of mutual interest.

“India and U.S. have a comprehensive global strategic partnership which includes political, security and defence, economic, commercial, technology and people-to-people contacts. We have regular dialogue for various levels to discuss ongoing bilateral cooperation and to exchange views on developments in the region,” the MEA statement said.

The MEA denied that the timing of the visit of senior U.S. officials exactly one week before U.S. elections on November 3, was unusual, and said it followed the pattern of “2+2” meetings in previous years.

“As regards the timing of the meeting, you know that diplomatic calendars have their logic, and you will notice that the earlier two meetings have been held towards the end of the year,” Mr. Srivastava said in response to a question from The Hindu.

In a separate response on progress in border negotiations with China, the MEA said, “India and China continue to have discussions through both diplomatic and military channels to peacefully resolve the issues along the LAC in India China Border areas..

This is a clear violation of the 2003 Ceasefire Understanding between the two sides. This year, till date, Pakistani forces have carried out more than 3,800 unprovoked ceasefire violations. There have also been attempts to drop arms and ammunition close to the LoC in the garb of civilian activities,"" said Mr Srivastava.

The Indian official also accused Pakistan of using drones and quadcopters for smuggling of arms and narcotic substances across the International Border (IB). “Such violations are regularly highlighted to Pakistan through diplomatic channels and at the regular DGMO level talks,” Mr. Srivastava said.

The accusations are timed with the ongoing FATF Plenary meeting which is looking at Pakistan’s compliance with the 27-point FATF Action Plan. The official also pointed out that Pakistan has not fulfilled several of the action items. “As is well known, Pakistan continues to provide safe havens to terrorist entities and individuals and has almost not yet taken any action against several entities and individuals including those proscribed by the UNSC such as Masood Azhar, Dawood Ibrahim, Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi.”

65,2020/10/22,‘Common Man’ statue to come up in Jaipur school,"The signature creation of legendary cartoonist R.K. Laxman will be built to mark his birth centenary and commemorate his special connection with Pink City

A statue of “Common Man”, the signature creation of legendary cartoonist R.K. Laxman, will shortly come up at a school in Jaipur to mark the centenary year of his birth and commemorate his special connection with the Pink City.

The late humorist, who died in 2015, had visited the Rajasthan Capital several times.

The iconic character’s statue will be built at Merry Lands School in Jaipur’s Malviya Nagar area. Laxman had attended many functions at the school and interacted with its students.

Dharmendra Bhandari, Jaipur-based author of Laxman’s biography, said here on Thursday that the statue would be a tribute to post-Independence India's greatest artist.

Laxman, born on October 24, 1921, used to come to Jaipur frequently as a guest of Dr. Bhandari. In 2003, he delivered a memorial oration commemorating Dr. Bhandari's mother, Prakash Bhandari, and laid the foundation stone for the Art, Music and Dance Academy at Merry Lands School.

Dr. Bhandari, who was earlier an associate professor in Rajasthan University, served as an officer on special duty to the Reserve Bank of India and an advisor to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on securities scam in 1992-93. He was also on the Board of Directors of Bank of Baroda and JP Morgan Mutual Fund.

Former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam wrote the foreword to R.K. Laxman: The Uncommon Man, authored by Dr. Bhandari. Laxman drew the cover designs of Dr. Bhandari's several other books as well. Dr. Bhandari said he used to commission the cartoonist for doing a lot of artworks and caricatures.

Dr. Bhandari curated a ‘Laxman Rekha’ exhibition of the artworks of Laxman at Jawahar Kala Kendra here in 2005, which was inaugurated by Kalam. The then President invited the Laxmans and Dr. Bhandari's family for a week-long holiday to Rashtrapati Bhavan later that year.

Dr. Bhandari said he and Laxman experienced the personal hospitality of the President for a week and spent hours conversing about a wide range of subjects. “The only notable omissions from our conversations were politics and politicians,” he noted.

Dr. Bhandari stated that Laxman’s work, which included the pictures of humour drawn in 1950s and 60s, were relevant even now. An exhibition of Laxman’s artworks hosted by the Indian Embassy in Belgium last year was so widely acclaimed that the European Union Parliament and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belgium exhibited the works for a week.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6c3rsg/article32920117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-COMMONMAN-VB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/common-man-statue-to-come-up-in-jaipur-school/article32920040.ece

The Editors Guild of India on Thursday said the sealing of the Srinagar offices of Kashmir Times was “reprehensible” and had disturbing implications for the media in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

On Monday, the J&K Union Territory administration sealed the newspaper’s Srinagar offices.

In a statement, the Guild said that newspapers and magazines in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which was replaced with the UTs of J&K and Ladakh last year, were “already ravaged by conflict”.

“Publications have steadily lost advertising over the last decade. Jammu and Kashmir’s communication shutdowns, followed by the pandemic lockdown, have totally stopped the trickle of revenue... Instead of assisting the media, which was most needed in these dark times, the administration without any notice took control of the office of Kashmir Times, putting its lock on the door. The newspaper editor, Ms. Anuradha Bhasin, and the staff have been denied access to records, computers, furniture and equipment in the office”, it stated.

‘Action is vindictive’

The Guild termed the action vindictive and called on the government to restore status quo.

The Press Club of India also issued a statement seeking the restoration of status quo.

“We demand that the authorities end their show of small-mindedness immediately, and restore the earlier status of the Srinagar office of Kashmir Times”, the statement said.

The PCI demanded the same for Ms. Bhasin's residence, which the administration had “raided”.

“Kashmir Times and Ms. Bhasin personally have attracted the ire of the authorities because she showed the gumption to challenge in the Supreme Court the circumstances- in particular closure of the internet and curfews, both of which made journalism impossible - that flowed from the deeply troubling decision taken by the Government of India on August 5 last year”, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uwbv12/article32919768.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-KASHMIRTIMES-NISSARAHMAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/editors-guild-kashmir-times-office-sealing-reprehensible/article32919769.ece

69,2020/10/22,"Priority in chartering to be given to ships built, flagged in India and owned by Indians: Govt","In a major boost to shipbuilding in India, the government has amended existing norms and now the first priority in chartering of vessels will be given to ships built and flagged in India as well as owned by Indians, Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Thursday.

The move in alignment with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat mission will promote ‘Make in India’ initiatives and give a strategic boost to domestic shipbuilding industries and generate employment, the minister said.

“To boost shipbuilding activities in india, the Ministry of Shipping has amended Right of First Refusal (ROFR) licensing conditions. Now, it has been decided that for any kind of charter of a vessel undertaken through a tender process, the first priority for RoFR would be given to Indian built, Indian flagged and Indian owned vessels,” Shipping Minister Mandaviya told PTI.

The second priority will be given to foreign built, Indian flagged and Indian-owned vessels while the third priority will be given to Indian built, foreign flagged and foreign-owned ships, he said and termed the policy change a “bold step” in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to promote the domestic industry.

The Ministry of Shipping has reviewed the ROFR licensing conditions for chartering of vessels/ships through tender process for all types of requirements in pursuance of ‘Make in India’ policy of the government.

“The revision of RoFR licensing conditions is a giant step towards Aatmanirbhar Shipping. It will promote ‘Make in India’ initiatives through self-reliance and will give a strategic boost to domestic shipbuilding industries, contributing towards long-term economic growth of India,” Mandaviya said.

“India mostly handles four types of EXIM cargo - crude, gas, coal and fertiliser. Government of India floats tenders for bringing these from foreign. So far Indian flags were given priority in tender irrespective of where the ship is built. Now we have changed that in addition to Indian flag it should be ‘made in India’ Government PSUs used to give priority to Indian flags till now but now Indian make has also been included,” Mr. Mandaviya said.

He elaborated that if any international vessel emerges the lowest bidder in any tender, ‘Indian built, Indian flagged and Indian owned vessels’ would be first offered the chance to match that bid irrespective of the fact that they had bid higher amount and if they are ready, tender would be given to them first. Only after their refusal, the bid will go to any other vessel, he added.

To promote the demand of the ships built in India, priority in chartering of vessels is given to vessels built in India, flagged in India and owned by Indians under the amendments in the guidelines of the ROFR.

The minister said the idea was to enhance India’s share in global shipbuilding from barely one per cent at present to 3 per cent in the next five years.

“There are 24 shipyards and shipbuilding activities are bound to boost post this step and in turn would result in employment of a large number of labourers, technicians, engineers and other skilled personnel,” he said.

All vessels flying the flag of India (i.e. registered in India) up to the date of issue of new circular by the Director General of Shipping shall be deemed to be Indian built vessels, the Ministry of Shipping said.

Besides, it said the foreign flagged vessels permitted by DG (Shipping) for chartering by an Indian citizen/company/society, who is building a ship in an Indian shipyard for registration under the Indian flag, as a temporary substitute for the Indian ship under construction, shall come under first priority provided “25 per cent of the contract money has been paid to the Indian shipyard” and “50 per cent of the hull fabrication has been completed, as certified by recognised organisation.”

The duration of licence to such chartered vessel shall be limited to the period of building of the ship, as mentioned in the shipbuilding contract.

It is to be noted that the Ministry of Shipping has made provision for long-term subsidy for shipbuilding activities under shipbuilding financial assistance policy (2016-2026).

The ministry has already disbursed an amount of Rs 61.05 crore till date under this policy.

It is an endeavour of the government to further incentivise shipbuilding by providing additional market access and business support to ships built in India, Mr. Mandaviya said.

He said the revised guidelines will give a boost to the domestic shipbuilding and shipping industries and encourage the domestic shipping industry to support the domestic shipping industry.

The minister said to revive the Indian shipbuilding industry, the government has already asked all major ports to procure or charter tug boats that are made in India.

India has 12 major ports -- Kandla, Mumbai, JNPT, Mormugao, New Mangalore, Cochin, Chennai, Kamarajar (Ennore), VO Chidambaranar, Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Kolkata (including Haldia) -- that handle about 61 per cent of the country’s total cargo traffic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/priority-in-chartering-to-be-given-to-ships-built-flagged-in-india-and-owned-by-indians-govt/article32917676.ece

71,2020/10/22,SC notice to Centre on plea for SOP mandating pre-litigation mediation,"The apex court was hearing a petition filed by Youth Bar Association of India and advocate Sanpreet Singh Ajmani.

The Supreme Court has sought response from the Centre on a plea seeking formulation of standard operating procedure (SOP) for mandating pre-litigation mediation across the country to reduce pendency of cases.

A bench of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde, A.S. Bopanna, and V. Ramasubramanian issued notices to the Ministry of Law and Justice and various high courts on the plea.

Issue notice returnable in four weeks, the bench said.

The apex court was hearing a petition filed by Youth Bar Association of India and advocate Sanpreet Singh Ajmani which suggested that alternate and pre-litigation processes be made mandatory to reduce pendency of cases in various courts.

Also read | Opinion: Settling disputes out of court

According to the petition, use of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms will help to control frivolous matters coming up for hearing by giving an opportunity to parties to settle their disputes amicably before any litigation can start.

The plea contended that pre-litigation mediation is an attempt to resolve the dispute among the parties amicably with the help of neutral third party called Mediator before going to the court or even before filing litigation or sending a notice.

It gives a chance to both the parties to end the dispute in a win-win position. In it issues can be sorted out sooner and this process is inexpensive compared to the expenditure incurred at every stage of the case/issues in litigation.

To reduce the number of pending cases, the Government should work on a mechanism to introduce a pre-litigation mediation process, so that avoidable cases can be prevented from reaching the courts and settle the issue effectively, the plea said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/5qte3g/article31679427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SCKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-notice-to-centre-on-plea-for-sop-mandating-pre-litigation-mediation/article32917264.ece

73,2020/10/22,Government relaxes visa restrictions,"Except electronic tourist visa on arrival, which includes short-term medical visa, all visa restrictions have been lifted.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Thursday further relaxed visa restrictions enabling foreigners to come to India for various purposes such as business, conference, employment, education, research and medical purposes. Except electronic tourist visa on arrival, which includes short-term medical visa, all visa restrictions have been lifted.

“The government has now decided to make a graded relaxation in visa and travel restrictions for more categories of foreign nationals and Indian nationals who wish to enter or leave India. Therefore, it has been decided to permit all OCI (Overseas Citizens of India) and PIO (Persons of Indian Origin) card holders and all other foreign nationals intending to visit India for any purpose, except on a Tourist Visa to enter by air or water routes through authorized airports and seaport immigration check posts. This includes flights operated under Vande Bharat Mission, Air Transport Bubble arrangements or by any non scheduled commercial flights as allowed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation,” the MHA said in a statement.

Adherence to guidelines

All such travellers should, however, strictly adhere to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare regarding quarantine and other health/COVID-19 matters, it stated.

“Under this graded relaxation, Government of India has also decided to restore with immediate effect all existing visas (except electronic visa, Tourist Visa and Medical Visa).

74,2020/10/22,"Contract of insurance is of utmost good faith, says SC","“A proposer who seeks to obtain a policy of life insurance is duty bound to disclose all material facts.”

A contract of insurance is of utmost good faith and a proposer who seeks to obtain life insurance policy is duty bound to disclose all material facts bearing upon the issue, the Supreme Court has said.

The apex court said this while setting aside the March this year verdict of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) which had dismissed the plea of an insurance firm against the order asking it to pay full death claim along with interest to the mother of the deceased.

A bench headed by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud noted that the proposal form requires a specific disclosure of pre-existing ailments, so as to enable the insurer to arrive at a considered decision based on the actuarial risk.

“A contract of insurance is one of utmost good faith. A proposer who seeks to obtain a policy of life insurance is duty bound to disclose all material facts bearing upon the issue as to whether the insurer would consider it appropriate to assume the risk which is proposed,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee.

The bench delivered its judgement on an appeal filed by insurance firm against the NCDRC’s verdict which had rejected its plea against the state’s CDRC order in the matter.

While setting aside the NCDRC’s order, the bench noted the proposer had failed to disclose that he was suffering from pre-existing illness and also about vomiting of blood which had taken place barely a month prior to the issuance of policy.

“The investigation by the insurer indicated that the assured was suffering from a pre-existing ailment, consequent upon alcohol abuse and that the facts which were in the knowledge of the proposer had not been disclosed,” it said.

“We are, therefore, of the view that the judgment of the NCDRC in the present case does not lay down the correct principle of law and would have to be set aside. We order accordingly,” it said.

The counsel appearing for the insurance firm informed the apex court that during the pendency of proceedings, the entire claim was paid over to the nominee, except the amount of cost.

“Having regard to the age of the respondent (mother of deceased), who is seventy years old and the death of the assured on whom she was likely to be dependent, we are of the view that it would be appropriate for this court to utilize its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution, by directing that no recoveries of the amount which has been paid shall be made from the respondent,” it said.

In August 2014, a proposal for obtaining insurance policy was submitted by the man and the form contained questions pertaining to his health, medical history and required a specific disclosure on whether any ailment, hospitalization or treatment had been undergone by him.

The proposer had answered these queries in the negative, indicating that he had not undergone any medical treatment or hospitalization and was not suffering from any ailment.

Based on the information provided by the man, an insurance policy was issued. Later in September 2014, he died following which a claim was lodged.

During independent investigation, the hospital treatment records were obtained and it revealed that he had been suffering from Hepatitis C.

The insurance firm had repudiated the claim in May 2015 on account of non-disclosure of material facts.

The nominee had initiated a consumer compliant before the district consumer disputes redressal forum which had directed the insurance firm to pay full death claim together with interest.

The appeal against the order was rejected by the state consumer disputes redressal commission and later, the NCDRC also dismissed the plea of the insurance firm.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u8efqs/article32508873.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3TH-SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/contract-of-insurance-is-of-utmost-good-faith-says-sc/article32916488.ece

76,2020/10/22,Govt. warns Twitter over map misrepresentation,"Any disrespect of sovereignty and integrity is totally unacceptable, it says

India has warned Twitter over its location setting that showed Leh in China, saying any disrespect of the country’s sovereignty and integrity is totally unacceptable.

In a strongly worded letter, Ajay Sawhney, Secretary in the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), asked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to respect the sensitivities, sources in the Ministry said.

Twitter came under heavy criticism and faced backlash from social media users after its geotagging feature displayed “Jammu & Kashmir, People’s Republic of China” in a live broadcast from Leh’s Hall of Fame, a war memorial for fallen soldiers in the Union Territory of Ladakh.

This triggered angry responses from netizens who demanded that stringent action be initiated against the micro-blogging platform.

Twitter, earlier this week, called it a technical issue which has been swiftly resolved.

Sources said Mr. Sawhney, in the letter sent on Wednesday evening, warned Twitter that any attempt to undermine the sovereignty and integrity of India will not just bring disrepute to the micro-blogging site but also raises questions about its neutrality and fairness as an intermediary.

He reminded Twitter that Leh is the headquarters of the Union Territory of Ladakh. And that both Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir are integral and inalienable parts of India, governed by the Constitution.

When contacted, Twitter in an e-mail response said: “Twitter remains committed to working with the Government of India.

77,2020/10/22,Economy not a circus lion that will respond to ringmaster: Chidambaram,"Former Finance Minister reacts to comments by senior officials on state of economy

Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Thursday said there was no point in trying to talk up the economy as it was not a circus lion that would respond to a ringmaster.

In a series of tweets, Mr. Chidambaram, who was reacting a day after senior officials spoke on the state of the economy, asserted that unless the government put money in the hands of the people, it would not help.

“Is it not intriguing that the RBI Governor, the SEBI Chairman and the DEA Secretary should speak on the same day on the same subject ? All three have tried to “talk up” the economy. I wish the economy was a circus lion that would respond to the stick of the ringmaster !”

On Wednesday, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said that India was at the doorstep of an economic recovery.

Responding to the comments, Mr. Chidambaram said the economy was largely determined by the market, laws of demand and supply, purchasing power and sentiments of the people.

“The three distinguished men should tell the Finance Minister, in unison, that the vast majority of the people do not have the money or the inclination to buy goods and services. Unless the government puts money in the hands of the bottom half of the families and puts food on the plates of the poor, the economy will not revive smartly,” he said.

The former Union Minister cited the example of election-bound Bihar, where voters reportedly complained about an “existential crisis” because of no work or income.

“If you doubt what I say, just listen to the voices of the voters of Bihar on their existential crisis — no work or not enough work, no income or little income, and their thoughts are on surviving, not on spending,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ajt7vq/article32847238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14CHIDAMBARAMNEWS3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/economy-not-a-circus-lion-that-will-respond-to-ringmaster-chidambaram/article32915699.ece

81,2020/10/22,EC sets up panel to study candidates’ expenditure limit,"Decision following increase in number of electors, rise in Cost Inflation Index and other factors

The Election Commission on Wednesday said it had set up a committee “to examine the issues concerning expenditure limit for a candidate in view of the increase in number of electors and rise in the Cost Inflation Index and other factors.”

The expenditure limit for Lok Sabha and Assembly candidates is ₹70 lakh and ₹28 lakh respectively, but on Monday the Law Ministry has approved a 10% hike for the COVID-19 period.

The committee, comprising former IRS officer and Director General (Investigation) Harish Kumar and Secretary General and DG (Expenditure) Umesh Sinha, would submit its report within 120 days of its constitution, an EC statement said.

The expenditure limit for a candidate was last revised in 2014, and for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, it was revised in 2018, the EC said.

82,2020/10/22,Cabinet nod for NAFED to procure 12 lakh tonnes of J&K apples,"Only 1% of procurement target reached last year

The Union Cabinet has given its nod for a Central procurement agency to buy 12 lakh tonnes of apples in Jammu and Kashmir this year, even though the same scheme flopped when it was introduced last year, managing to procure only about 1% of its target.

Apple procurement in the Union Territory will be done by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED) through designated State agencies, under a Market Intervention Scheme of the Agriculture Ministry, according to an official statement. On Wednesday, the Cabinet approved the extension of the scheme to the current 2020-21 season on the same terms and conditions as the last season.

Last year, apple procurement was announced in September, in the wake of a lockdown of the Valley after Article 370 was abrogated and the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir dissolved into two Union Territories. Political turmoil, frequent curfews and transport blockades, and unseasonal snowfall, had exacerbated the plight of apple farmers, a key backbone of the local economy, and it was in that context that the Centre had offered to procure 13 lakh tonnes of apples via NAFED.

However, only 15,770 tonnes of fruit valued at ₹70 crore were bought by NAFED last year, against a target of 13 lakh tonnes, according to the Home Ministry’s reply to a question in the Lok Sabha in February 2020. Earlier, in November, with the season almost over, the Agriculture Ministry had told the House that less than 8,000 tonnes had been procured. Whichever figure is accurate, less than 1% of the total harvest of approximately 20 lakh tonnes were procured, leaving farmers bereft.

In fact, some farmers groups had then said that by selling the procured fruits at a loss in Punjab markets, NAFED had effectively driven down prices and caused further losses.

This year, the procurement process will be monitored by panels headed by the Cabinet Secretary at the Centre and the Chief Secretary at the UT level, according to the official statement. Designated Price Committees set up last season will continue to set prices for the various varieties and grades of apples, while the J&K administration will provide facilities in the designated procurement mandis. Last year, most mandis were shut, farmers groups had said.

The Centre has allowed NAFED to use a government guarantee of ₹2,500 crore for this operation, the statement said. Losses incurred, if any, will be shared by the Centre and the Union Territory’s administration on a 50:50 basis. Procurement will be done directly from apple growers and payment will be done into their bank accounts via direct benefit transfers.

“This announcement of the Government of India will provide an effective marketing platform to apple growers and will facilitate employment generation for the local people. It will ensure remunerative prices for apples resulting in overall income enhancement of farmers in J&K,” said the statement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cabinet-nod-for-nafed-to-procure-12-lakh-tonnes-of-jk-apples/article32913345.ece

The Bombay High Court, referring to the probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, on Wednesday asked Republic TV’s lawyer if asking the public who should be arrested in a case was part of investigative journalism.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni posed this question to counsel Malvika Trivedi representing Republic TV with respect to the hashtag campaign ‘#ArrestRhea’ run by the channel.

The Bench asked, “The grievance is regarding #arrestrhea. Why is this part of your channel news? When a case is under investigation and the issue is whether its a homicide or a suicide and a channel is saying it is murder, is all this investigative journalism?”

The court said, “investigative powers are given to the police under the Cr.PC [Code of Criminal Procedure] and you have become the investigator, prosecutor, judge and you also declare the verdict. Then why are we here?”

The court asked why the channel broadcast photos of the body, and speculated on whether the actor’s death was a case of suicide or homicide.

The court was hearing a bunch of public interest litigation petitions against the unfair, malicious and false media campaign against the Mumbai police and seeking directions from the court to issue guidelines to be followed by all media to curtail any comments which may jeopardise the probe.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/n47rgt/article31960285.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-BOMBAY-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hc-poses-questions-to-republic-tv-on-its-hashtag-campaign-against-rhea/article32913344.ece
84,2020/10/22,"Detentions should be in conformity with Constitution, laws, says SC judge","Supreme Court judge, Justice U.U. Lalit, said on Wednesday detention of persons should be in conformity with the Constitution and the laws.

Justice Lalit was speaking at an international web series of Indian judges and jurists in conversation with American jurists conducted by the Georgetown University Law Center and the Society for Democratic Rights based in New Delhi. The topic of the conversation was “Keeping the Executive in Check — The Role of the Judiciary”.

Justice Lalit was responding to a question from debate moderator, Dean William M. Treanor, on how the Supreme Court of India has been called upon to rule on the limits of the government’s national security powers.

“There are two facets to national security — our Constitution permits preventive detention in certain matters to stop somebody from indulging in prejudicial activities against the nation. There laws framed under the Constitution. There are checks and balances so far as the exercise [of preventive detention] is concerned,” Justice Lalit said.

Justice Lalit said preventive detention, as a facet of the State’s powers under national security, allows the government to detain a person without adjudication of his or her guilt. This detention can be extended to a year or so, Justice Lalit explained.

The Supreme Court judge said the power of judicial review of the court is wide and extends to even Constitutional Amendments.

Justice Lalit said the very fact that over 40,000 cases come to the court was proof of the public faith in the Supreme Court.

At one point, Professor Neal Katyal, Paul and Patricia Saunders Professor of National Security Law and the former Acting Solicitor General of the United States, also a participant, asked Justice Lalit how Benches were formed in the Supreme Court to hear cases and whether there was any public explanation made from the court why particular judges were selected to hear a case.

Justice Lalit said the choice of judges on a Bench was left to the “pure discretion” of the Chief Justice of India.

Professor Katyal said the judges on the United States Supreme Court treat their Chief Justice as first among equals with no special powers.

Justice Lalit replied that the Chief Justice of India was equal to other judges on the judicial side. Other judges could overrule his judgment. But he was the master of the roster, deciding on his own which judge should hear which case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/detentions-should-be-in-conformity-with-constitution-laws-says-sc-judge/article32913341.ece
85,2020/10/22,Extremists kill villager in Odisha,"They alleged that he was a police informer

Hours after the Border Security Force (BSP) detected and defused an improvised explosive device in Odisha’s Swambhiman Anchal — once a naxal hotbed, left wing extremists reportedly killed one person and critically injured two others.

Members of the banned CPI (Maoist) of Guma Area Committee perpetrated the violence in Khajuriguda village under the limits of the Jodambo police station after accusing the villager of being a police informer, said Malkangiri district police.

The ultras had slit the throat of Dasu Khemudu and also assaulted two other persons, identified as Sana Santa and Samru Khila, of Khajuriguda.

“The attack was carried out to obstruct the development going on in the area. They wanted to warn people not to interact with forces. People have, however, come out in large numbers to support security forces and development,” said Shefeen Ahamed, Deputy Inspector General (police) of the south western region.

By spreading fear, the CPI (Maoist) leadership is trying to ensure that the area remains backward and cut off from the mainstream, Mr. Ahamed said, adding that such killings would instead alienate them from local people. The injured villagers have returned to Khajuriguda village after treatment.

The BSP personnel deployed in Swabhiman Anchal had detected seven IEDs that were buried strategically near a bridge and under a mango tree close to the Odisha-Andhra Pradesh border.

86,2020/10/22,"NCW’s Rekha Sharma called ‘bigot’, ‘misogynist’ after “love jihad” tweet","After Twitter users re-post her old tweets, she restricts her twitter account and removes old posts

Head of the women’s rights panel, the National Commission for Women, Rekha Sharma, has been variously decribed as ‘bigot’, ‘misogynist’, “garden variety troll”, after she tweeted on Monday about her meeting with Maharashtra Governor B.S. Khoshiyari over the “rising number of love jihad cases”.

The term “love jihad” is a derogatory reference made by right-wing activists against inter-faith marriages. Many Twitter users attacked Ms. Sharma by re-posting her old tweets dating between 2011 and 2016 where she made repulsive remarks about Mahatma Gandhi, former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as well as sexual innuendos about women politicians like Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. Ms. Sharma told The Hindu that she doesn’t regret using the disparaging reference and that she was being trolled because of her work at the NCW.

But an old tweet purportedly from her account in 2012 against Prime Minister Narendra Modi forced her to spring to her defence on Tuesday and she replied, “Someone hacked my account and tweeted against Narendra Modi. How mischievous people are. Coming from Maharashtra and can understand why this happened.” In her tweet against the then Gujarat Chief Minister, she had written, “Narendra Modi is deaf and mute whose life revolves around mentally challenged women.”

Since making the hacking claims, Ms. Sharma has protected her Twitter account, which prohibits anyone apart from her followers from seeing her tweets or tweeting to her.

Pratik Sinha, co-founder of fact checking portal AltNews, says Ms. Sharma had soon after started to clean up her twitter history and removed 470 tweets.

“After she protected her Twitter account, NCW Chairperson has deleted nearly 460 tweets. Often the first thing Twitter users do after protecting their account after such controversies is to delete old tweets. So, we started monitoring her Twitter account and we kept archiving her account at regular intervals and found that her total tweets dropped down to 16,461 from 16,937 at the time she protected her account.” He adds that it may be difficult to determine the content of tweets deleted besides the ones which are already in public domain.

“The tweets that have been highlighted on social media are only a small number of these 470 tweets, but clearly are those that she, or whoever is behind the clean-up act, thinks should not exist on her account.”

When The Hindu spoke to Ms. Sharma she said she didn’t regret using the term “love jihad”, but added that she could have used the phrase “forced conversion because of marriage”. “I have been trolled badly for the past two days. It is because people don’t like NCW working so hard.”

“When someone uses the term love jihad they are saying that Hindu woman is the property of her community and she can’t choose to love a Muslim man and if she does, we can’t listen to her and she is a victim of love jihad. Her autonomy is not respected by those who treat her as property and hate Muslims. For NCW as an institution to have tweeted this and for Rekha Sharma to have done this is of course the lowest of the low,” says Kavitha Krishnan, a woman’s rights activist and a member of the CPI(ML).

“When it is the RSS or the BJP appointing someone to the post of the Chairperson of NCW, they pick up someone like Rekha Sharma who has posted a series of tweets, where she behaves like a garden variety troll towards women in public life. They probably think she qualifies for this position because they don’t want a feminist, but someone who is absolutely patriarchal, preferably casteist and of course, communal.

Mohini Giri, chairperson of the second NCW Commission constituted in 1995, rues the deterioration of the NCW, which she says was a result of the women’s rights struggle of the 1980s.

“The NCW Act which was passed in 1990 in Parliament was a result of a lot of hard work and women’s rights movement of the 1980s against dowry deaths and bride burning or Sati. The likes of Veena Majumdar, Geeta Mukherjee, I as well as the seven sisters [seven women’s rights organisations including the AIWC, AIDWA, CWDS, NFIW, Mahila Dakshata Samiti, Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) and Joint Women’s Program (JWP)] had pushed for a women’s commission to safeguard women’s interest. When I headed it, we didn’t serve the cause of a particular party, but those of women. The NCW Act requires that the head of the Commission should be a women’s rights activist, but the current Chairperson has no such background. The problem is that the NCW receives funds from the Ministry of Women and Child Development, while to be fully independent it should perhaps be allocated funds under the Consolidated Fund of India like NHRC.”

A government proposal in 2014-2015, floated by former Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi, to give teeth to the NCW was quitely buried. The proposal was to give the NCW powers on par with civil courts so that it could issue warrants and conduct judicial proceedings and was submitted to the PMO.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ygqeer/article31312225.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-RekhaSharma,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ncws-rekha-sharma-called-bigot-misogynist-after-love-jihad-tweet/article32913343.ece

Deputy Commissioner of Police Abhishek Trimukhe confirmed this to The Hindu and said, “They have been issued notices after the direction from the court.”

On October 17, the Bandra magistrate court ordered a FIR to be registered against the duo for “promoting enmity between groups on grounds of religion” through their tweets.

This direction came after Munnawarali alias Sahil Ahsrafali Sayyed, a film casting director, filed an application before the court.

The application said, “Her [Ms. Ranaut’s] tweets are creating divisions between Hindu Artists and Muslim Artists. I say that she is maliciously bringing religion in almost all her tweets for example lynching of Hindu Sadhus at Palghar, calling the BMC as “BABUR SENA”. I say that she has gone to such an extent that she has also blamed Jamaatis for spreading Corona virus etc. thereby trying to create hatred and communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims deliberately as she is well aware that she is a well known actress and has a big fan base so her tweets will be seen and will reach out to many people.”

He urged the court to give a direction to the police to register an FIR against the sisters under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), and 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code.

About 30 elephant trackers from both sides located the tusker moving close to the Gudiyattam-Chittoor road on the border. The trackers, with the help of drumbeats and firing of crackers, drove the pachyderm towards the Gudiyattam range crossing the Chittoor limits. As the animal moved deep into the forests beyond the 5-km range, the possibility of its making an immediate comeback into the vicinity of the border villages was considered remote.

A single-judge Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, comprising Justice R. Raghunandan Rao, has ordered the postponement of the APPSC Group-I Mains examination scheduled to be conducted on November 2 and preparation of fresh preliminary results citing certain mistakes in the final key.

Notification for the Group-I examination was issued on December 31, 2018, and the preliminary examination was conducted on May 26, 2019.

Errors in final key

There was a batch of 10 cases for cancellation of the examinations and reservations for the physically challenged and SCs and STs in the preliminary examination, and a case that challenged the correctness of the final key.

The court dismissed the writ petitions that wanted the examinations to be cancelled altogether.

Reservation

As far as the demand for reservations in the preliminary examination is concerned, the court upheld the selection in 1:50 ratio without any reservation. The judge agreed with the APPSC’s argument that there was no rule to that effect and preliminary marks were not considered for the final merit list.

Regarding errors in the final key, Mr. Justice Raghunandan Rao directed that five questions be reconsidered by the APPSC, and it should prepare a fresh preliminary qualified list of candidates who can write the mains.

96,2020/10/22,HC questions rationale behind SEC’s plea on official residence,"‘Is it not a waste of public money to have one in Hyderabad and another in Vijayawada?’

The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Thursday questioned the rationale behind State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar’s plea that his residence in Hyderabad be declared as the official residence of the A.P. State Election Commissioner.

A single-judge bench which consisted of Justice B. Devanand, also asked whether it was not a waste of public money to have the official residence in Hyderabad and another one in Vijayawada.

‘No proof of denial of support’

Reserving its order on the State Election Commission’s writ petition accusing the government of not cooperating in the conduct of local body elections and holding back funds of ₹40 lakh sanctioned in January 2020, the court was of the view that the petitioner was unable to show any proof of denial of support, except of non-payment of certain amounts to the SEC.

Presenting his arguments during a hearing on the writ petition, Government Pleader C. Sumon claimed that a sum of ₹39.70 lakh was released on October 20 and about ₹110 crore since July 2019.

He further said that the SEC’s contention that the government’s non-cooperation obstructed the process of elections had not been substantiated.

He insisted that the affidavit filed by Mr. Ramesh Kumar neither contained any averment nor showed any instance of non-cooperation.

The Government Pleader further pointed out that the State government was constitutionally obligated to extend all support and cooperation to the SEC, and that the question of support arises when the elections were announced.

The petitioner also alleged that some posts were not filled by the government, but the court asked where was the proof of it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/6r3zuh/article32818643.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09gt-hc-notice-G8U7RH8G53jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hc-questions-rationale-behind-secs-plea-on-official-residence/article32922318.ece
97,2020/10/22,Treat floods in A.P. and Telangana as national calamity: Narayana,"He also asks Centre to withdraw ‘corporate-friendly’ farm Acts

CPI national secretary K. Narayana on Thursday urged the Centre to treat the floods in Andhra Pradesh and Telagana as a “national calamity” and extend liberal assistance to the two States.

Addressing the media here, Mr. Narayana said the flood situation in the two States was grim. The Centre’s liberal financial support was needed to help the two States to take up relief and rehabilitation measures on a war-footing.

The CPI leader accused the ruling BJP at the Centre and the ruling TRS in Telangana of paying too much attention on Hyderabad alone with an eye on the civic body elections for the sake of “political gains” and ignoring the other flood-affected areas.

Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s caution to people as the threat of COVID-19 still continued, he said, “Empty words do not matter.”

Health sector allocation

The Centre should show its commitment in the fight against the pandemic by stepping up allocation to the health sector to at least 6% of the Gross Domestic product (GDP) against a little less than 2% earmarked now.

He demanded that the Centre withdraw the three “corporate-friendly” farm Acts as they spelt doom for the farmers in the predominantly agrarian country.

The Centre was pursuing its “corporate-friendly” economic agenda, including reforms in the power sector, much against democratic principles and federal spirit of the Constitution, Mr. Narayana alleged, adding that it was unfortunate that the Jagan Mohan Reddy Government backed the BJP’s “suicidal economic policies” to the hilt.

At the time of COVID-19-induced economic meltdown, the Modi government was preoccupied with currying favours to the corporate sector by aggressively pursuing liberalisation policies, he charged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/geo97i/article32922294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJPG4-NARAYANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/treat-floods-in-ap-and-telangana-as-national-calamity-narayana/article32922295.ece
98,2020/10/22,NEET aspirants allege discrepancies in marks,"They appeal to NTA to supply them an office copy of the OMR sheet

Days after the announcement of results of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET UG 2020), many students from across the country are complaining about “discrepancies” in their marks.

A few candidates who have reportedly contacted the National Testing Agency (NTA) to report the same allege that they haven’t received any support.

In Anantapur district, Narreddy Pedavemannagari Siva Prakash Reddy, who had appeared for the examination conducted on September 13, is facing a similar quandary, and suspects that his Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) sheet has been tampered with.

‘Huge difference’

“When I checked my OMR sheet and the answer key released by the NTA on its official website on October 6, I got a score of 639 out of 720 marks. But, in the final results declared on October 16, the score card showed only 419 marks, a difference of 220 marks,” Siva Prakash told The Hindu on Thursday.

“Since we had not downloaded the OMR sheet on October 6, we had visited the NTA website to recheck the OMR sheet after the results were declared. But it was completely different. It was not my brother’s OMR sheet,” alleged Siva Prakash’s sister Vineetha.

She said that they had compared her brother’s OMR with that of his friend’s and found that Siva Prakash’s OMR was not original.

‘Nil response’

“The OMR has been tampered with,” Ms. Vineetha alleged. “The multiple mails to the NTA, requesting for an office copy of my brother’s OMR have evoked nil response,” she alleged.

Reports of students pointing out discrepancies have surfaced from many places.

Venkata Vineela of Nandyal in Kurnool district had earlier told the media that as per the final key, she should have scored 550 marks. “But in the final results, I scored only 113 marks,” she lamented.

Similarly, Sai Akshay of Chennai had alleged that his OMR sheet had been manipulated and that he was awarded zero marks. K.S. Manoj, a student from Coimbatore, alleged that his OMR sheet had been tampered with.

It may noted here that Mridul Rawat, who had been declared “failed” as per the mark-sheet issued by the NTA, later emerged all-India topper in the ST category after he challenged the result and re-checked his OMR sheet.

Siva Prakash said the NTA should respond and provide them with the official copy of the OMR sheet for revaluation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/neet-aspirants-allege-discrepancies-in-marks/article32922228.ece

113,2020/10/22,Centre’s privatisation policy will hurt service sector: CPI(M),"Leaders accuse YSRCP and TDP of toeing NDA govt.’s line

The CPI(M) Greater Visakha City Committee on Wednesday condemned the move of the NDA government to privatise various Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), and accused the YSRCP government and the opposition TDP of ‘toeing the line of the Centre’.

“The move will hamper the growth of Visakhapatnam city, which has a number of PSUs like Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT), Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL), Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), apart from defence units and Railways,” CPI(M) Greater Visakha City Committee secretary B. Ganga Rao and Secretariat member R.K.S.V. Kumar told reporters here on Wednesday.

The party members alleged that the Centre was trying to hand over Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) to South Korean steel major POSCO. “Privatisation will lead to decline in employment opportunities and reduction in wages, which will ultimately affect the service sector. The BJP government is trying to amend labour laws to benefit corporate managements,” they alleged, adding that the BJP was also attempting to fan communal tensions in Visakhapatnam city for their own political mileage.

They also alleged that the State government was trying to privatise civic services and to hike user charges, under pressure from the Centre. The property tax was planned to be levied, based on the value of the house, rather than the total area. This would result in an increase in the property tax by three to four times. GVMC was planning to hike water charges and fix meters for water tap connections. Discoms were also planned to be privatised, they alleged.

The construction of 25,000 houses had started during the previous TDP government in Visakhapatnam city. Some of them were completed but they have not been allotted to this day, though selection of beneficiaries was done and allotment letters were issued to them long ago. The beneficiaries had paid amounts ranging between ₹25,000 and ₹1 lakh through demand drafts. The State government has cancelled the allotments made in the past and now plans to make fresh allotments, they alleged. Opposing the cancellation of allotments made in the past, they demanded completion of the houses and immediate allotment to the beneficiaries.

The CPI(M) leaders alleged that the GVMC officials had laid a road illegally to an apartment complex, being constructed by the company belonging to Visakhapatnam MP M.V.V. Satyanarayana in Survey no. 67 at Yendada in the city. They sought action against the officials responsible for laying a road to a private property.

They said that the CPI(M) would launch a door-to-door campaign from November 1 to 15 on the problems of the people in the city.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/z500fe/article32914658.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31vzskp2PublicGJO2OTDF93jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/centres-privatisation-policy-will-hurt-service-sector-cpim/article32912706.ece

119,2020/10/22,ASW corvette INS Kavaratti to be commissioned in Vizag today,"The indigenously built ship can detect and destroy submarines

The last of the four indigenously built Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) stealth corvettes ‘INS Kavaratti’ under the Project 28 (Kamorta class) is scheduled to be commissioned into the Indian Navy by General Manoj Mukund Naravane, Chief of the Army Staff, at the Naval Dockyard in Visakhapatnam on Thursday.

Said to be a potent stealth ASW corvette, Kavaratti is indigenously designed by the Indian Navy’s in-house organisation Directorate of Naval Design (DND), and built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) in Kolkata.

This initiative portrays the growing capability of the Indian Navy, GRSE and the nation in becoming self-reliant, in tune with the national objective of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.

The ship has up to 90% indigenously built content and the use of carbon composite for the superstructure is a commendable feat achieved in Indian shipbuilding. The ship’s weapons and sensors suite are predominantly indigenous.

Kavaratti has the state-of-the-art weapons and sensor suite which are capable of detecting and destroying submarines. In addition to its anti-submarine warfare capability, the ship has a credible self-defence capability and good endurance for long-range deployments.

Combat-ready platform

The ship will be commissioned into the Navy as a combat-ready platform as it has completed the sea trials of all the systems on board.

125,2020/10/22,Visakha Agency a repository of vintage firearms,"Many arms date back to the tribal rebellion era in 18th and 19th century: experts

On October 14, B. Balaram, a 24-year-old tribal, was allegedly shot dead by Poorna Rao, one of his hunting companion, in the Baliaguda forest area in Dumbriguda mandal in Visakhapatnam Agency.

Around 20 people from the same village had gone on a hunting expedition and Balaram was reportedly shot dead accidentally by Poorna, who mistook Balaram’s concealed movement behind a bush for an animal. He died on the spot and the police arrested five of the hunting party members including Poorna and seized five country-made firearms. Well, this is not a stray incident. A few months ago one such incident was reported in Parvathipuram Agency in Vizianagaram district.

Hunting is considered to be a ritual for tribal people, especially during festivals, and they primarily hunt wild rabbits and wild boars commonly found in this part of the eastern ghats hills. They are generally armed with bow, arrows, spears and guns.

Many families living in the interior mandals such as G.K. Veedhi, Dumbriguda, G. Madugula, Munchingput, Koyyuru and Pedabayalu posses at least one firearm. The police term the weapons as ‘natu tupaki’ or country-made guns, but not many know that some of them have vintage value.

‘A matter of pride’

Experts say some of the guns owned by tribals are from the colonial period and are muzzle-loading, smooth-bore flintlock muskets, which could date back to the 18th and 19th century.

“For a tribal, possessing a musket is a matter of pride as they claim that the weapon has been passed down to him from his ancestors. The Agency areas from Rampa in East Godavari to Malkangiri in Odisha, spreading in Visakhapatnam district, have witnessed several violent rebellions against the British in different phases, by the likes Tamanna Dora (from 1839 to 1880) and Alluri Sitaramaraju (from 1922 to 1924). And some of the arms date back to those eras, which were looted from the British garrisons,” says prof. P.D. Satyapal of the Department of Anthropology in Andhra University,

Over the years, some have been maintained well, repaired and even remodelled by local craftsman and are in use till date, said Inspector General of Police Ch. Srikanth, who has spent considerable time in anti-Maoist operation in Visakha Agency.

Many tribals have used the old flintlock technology to manufacture new ones with the help of local blacksmiths and carpenters. If the arms are collected and exhibited, they can be quite an antique collection, as many still have the British markings engraved on brass plates pinned to the wooden butts of the muskets, he said.

The muskets are muzzle-load weapons, where gunpowder is poured into the barrel, a few pellets are dropped and stuffed with a rod and fired. Over the years, the tribals have learnt the art to collect the ingredients for making gunpowder.

‘No Munger connection’

Meanwhile, some senior police officers ruled out the possibility that the arms have the Munger connection. Moreover, the tribals who rarely go out of their native mandals, cannot reach Munger to buy a weapon. They neither have the access nor the money to buy the arms from Munger, said a police officer. Moreover, Maoists will not allow them to procure modern armsas they could be detrimental to their movement.

However, Visakha Range DIG L.K.V. Ranga Rao, says the police will collect all such arms to avoid recurrence of such incidentsand the matter is being probed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qxaezf/article32912406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22ONG5WEAPON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/visakha-agency-a-repository-of-vintage-firearms/article32912407.ece

128,2020/10/22,"‘New tourism policy will be flexible, aggressive’","It is aimed at giving industry status to mega projects: official

Special Chief Secretary, Tourism and Culture, Rajat Bhargav, on Wednesday said the new tourism policy, to be released soon, is not only flexible and aggressive but will also address key issues such as giving industry status to mega tourism projects.

Potential locations

Speaking at an online interactive session on ‘Revival of tourism in Andhra Pradesh’ organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Mr. Bhargav said the department had identified high potential locations for development of hotels and resorts, and had been actively marketing it to investors and developers of international repute. Plans were also in the offing to develop amusement parks and adventure sports while ensuring seamless connectivity of the destinations from all major airports.

He emphasised the importance of marketing in quick revival of tourism.

Responding to the issues raised by the industry bodies, Managing Director of AP Tourism Development Corporation and CEO of AP Tourism Authority Pravin Kumar said the department had adopted a strategy for revival of the sector. He said the next two months would be crucial from the standpoint of building confidence in the tourists about safe travel. Aggressive, yet cautious marketing, coupled with adherence to the SOPs for safe operation of hotels, would be critical for revival, he said.

Mr. Pravin Kumar said the APTDC had already started operating its 37 hotels across the State.

The tourism committee members stressed the importance of resolving the issues impeding the recovery of the sector. They said, though hotels and other establishments had opened, the footfalls were anything but encouraging.

They said the path to revival would involve building a perception of safe tourism in the minds of people, and the neighbouring States would have to work together to ensure free flow of tourists across borders.

“It will involve a coordinated effort between the stakeholders such as the Central government, State governments, tourism bodies, tour and travel operators and hospitality industry,” he emphasised.

They also recommended a unified mobile app to better synergise the efforts being undertaken by various states.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gdg28c/article32889743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ALL1South01AGCM78DSVL2jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/new-tourism-policy-will-be-flexible-aggressive/article32912337.ece
129,2020/10/22,JAC urges Transco CMD to address employees’ concerns immediately,"It drops plan to stage agitation for the time being

The A.P. State Power Employees’ Joint Action Committee has requested the AP-Transco CMD to immediately sort out certain critical issues faced by the power sector and not to go ahead with implementing its agenda without due consultations.

The JAC recently served a notice warning the management of resorting to agitation, but decided not to resort to such an action for the time being keeping the interests of the sector in view.

In a letter to the CMD, JAC office-bearers P. Chandrasekhar, M. Veda Vyasa Rao and B. Sai Krishna said there was unrest among the employees on the “unilateral decisions/actions” of the management, which was “using the COVID-19 pandemic situation to its advantage.”

‘Norms being ignored’

“The employee cost has been wrongly projected as 61%. There has been a consistent effort to paint the sector in poor light. The established norms, wage agreements, and protocols are being ignored,” they alleged.

The JAC demanded that the government publish a White Paper to let the people know about the financial health of the sector, and the agencies responsible for the state of affairs.

Among others, the JAC sought clarification on the quantum of rise in demand, power purchase cost, revenue realised, dues from various sources, projects pending, dues from Telangana, and the value of the properties left behind in Hyderabad, in which A.P. had a share.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jac-urges-transco-cmd-to-address-employees-concerns-immediately/article32912292.ece

Hundreds of people visiting the city during Dasara festivities are competing with one another to take selfies and photographs on the newly constructed Kanaka Durga flyover.

Many people, while travelling on the flyover, which was inaugurated recently, were seen posing for photographs standing at the parapet wall. With visitors parking their two and four-wheelers on the flyover to take a selfie, it is leading to traffic jams.

Police had a tough time in controlling the rush on the flyover, particularly near Indrakeeladri, which has a picturesque beauty of the temple and the aerial view of Krishna river.

“The scene from the flyover is beautiful. One can enjoy the overflowing Krishna River and Sri Kanaka Durga temple on the other side from the flyover,” said an Intermediate student K. Srivalli of Gollapudi.

“The place is so beautiful for taking photographs and selfies. As the flyover was opened recently, many visitors are preferring to click photographs from the structure near the temple,” said B. Mallikarjuna Rao of Eluru.

One Town Circle Inspector P. Venkateswarlu said the police were making efforts to prevent traffic congestion on the flyover near the temple. “The traffic and Blue Colts police are patrolling the flyover and clearing the rush. We are requesting the visitors not to park vehicles on the flyover and create traffic jams on the bridge,” the CI said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5do0f6/article32912289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22VJSELFIE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/selfie-crazy-people-cause-traffic-jams-on-new-flyover/article32912290.ece

Further, Mr. Revanna said the State government had ignored the basic principles of democracy while finalising the reservation for the posts of president and vice-president in urban local bodies. The BJP had planned to assume power in 48 local bodies without required strength. The officers had been supporting the ‘unethical’ practices of the government, he alleged.

133,2020/10/22,State to push for intangible cultural heritage tag for Mysuru Dasara,"Groundwork and documentation required for the purpose to be pursued seriously

Fresh efforts will be initiated to secure UNESCO’s intangible cultural heritage tag for Mysuru Dasara given its historicity and continuity.

The issue is being seriously promoted by the Department of Archaeology Museums and Heritage, Government of Karnataka, which has resolved to complete the groundwork and prepare the documentation required for the purpose.

This was also one of the resolutions passed in the heritage committee meeting held in December last year but the pandemic broke out soon after, bringing all activities to a halt.

N.S. Rangaraju, convenor of INTACH, Mysuru, and one of the members of the heritage committee, told The Hindu that this is a long-pending issue and should be taken to its logical end.

“Though our traditions such as Navaratri and Dasara don’t need anyone’s stamp of approval, securing the intangible cultural heritage tag will put Mysuru on the global map of tourism as a centre for art and culture besides helping promote the State’s culture at a global level’’, he said.

UNESCO has described intangible cultural heritage as ‘’practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognise as part of their cultural heritage’’. ‘

It also states that “intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity’’.

UNESCO lists oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural heritage; performing arts; social practices, rituals and festive events; traditional craftsmanship etc as forms of intangible cultural heritage.

At present tradition of Vedic chanting, Ramleela, chanting of Buddhist hymns in the Ladakh region, Yoga, Kumbh Mela, Navrouz, and Kutiyattam (Kerala’s Sanskrit theatre) are among the 12 traditions recognised as intangible cultural heritage.

There is a general perception that intangible heritage inscription for Dasara celebrations can also help promote greater pride in the city and its traditions. Prof. Rangaraju said it will also give a fresh thrust to the preservation of local traditions and cultural practices besides an increased visibility and spotlight on Mysuru.

Also, inscribing Dasara as an intangible cultural heritage will reinforce the sense of belonging and ownership which people of the State display towards the tradition which has been documented by medieval travellers including Domingos Paes and Fernao Nuniz of Portugal.

Celebrated in different ways across the country, Dasara in Mysuru is a legacy of the Vijayanagar emperors who ruled south India from 1336 CE to 1646 CE and extended State patronage to the cultural and religious tradition of the people. These practices were inherited by the Wadiyars of Mysuru and the festival is now celebrated as Nada Habba or People’s Festival.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/zddvnx/article32922263.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22MYSHERITAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-to-push-for-intangible-cultural-heritage-tag-for-mysuru-dasara/article32922264.ece
134,2020/10/22,MMCRI’s lab does over 1 lakh swab tests,"COVID-19 tests cross 2.50 lakh-mark with over 50,000 tests done in less than ten days

Even as the number of swab samples tested for COVID-19 has crossed 2.90 lakh-mark in Mysuru district, the Microbiology Laboratory of the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) has alone tested over one lakh swabs.

MMCRI Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj said 89,589 samples belong to Mysuru district while 11,024 samples were from other districts. In total 1,00,613 swab samples were subjected to testing at MMCRI till October 20, he added.

The lab at the MMCRI was also carrying out tests of samples sent from other districts in the beginning when they lacked the testing facilities. After the districts, including Kodagu, Mandya and Chamarajnagar, also got the COVID-19 labs, they started doing the tests in their own facilities and the samples sourced from Mysuru district were tested at the MMCRI lab.

Among the tests, 9,295 samples tested positive and this included 8,926 positive cases from Mysuru district and 369 from other districts, he said.

In the government labs, including the MMCRI’s lab, 2.59 lakh tests had been done and over 31,000 samples in the private labs as on October 21. The cumulative positive cases in Mysuru have crossed 45,000 with 45,864 cases as on October 21. This is the second highest in the State after the cases in Bengaluru.

The number of patients in home isolation was also decreasing with a remarkable recovery rate. As on Wednesday, 3,723 patients were in home isolation and the total active cases stand at 5,046. Nearly 75 percent of cases in Mysuru are in home isolation.

Meanwhile, the trauma care centre on the KRS Road may also launch treatment for COVID-19 soon with the work on equipping its beds with oxygen supply nearing completion.

The unoccupied building of Trauma Care Centre, which was inaugurated long ago but remained vacant for want of equipment and manpower, has been taken over and was being converted into the second largest COVID-19 hospital. As the facility was being designed to cater to the seriously-ill COVID-19 patients, who require oxygen support, an oxygen concentrator plant (which sources oxygen from atmospheric air) had been established on the hospital premises to overcome any shortage of liquid oxygen supply once the hospital becomes fully functional.

MLA L. Nagendra, MLA, on Wednesday inspected the hospital and told the doctors and officials carrying out the works to ensure early completion of the facility for COVID-19 treatment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/625nt5/article32925853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bg-mys-MMCRIG8L65K8BM3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mmcris-lab-does-over-1-lakh-swab-tests/article32922225.ece
135,2020/10/22,Case of Dalit girl missing for 5 years shrouded in mystery,"Mystery shrouds the case of a Dalit girl supposed to have married five years ago but was missing for 5 years and is now suspected to have been murdered by her in-laws.

The victim, Meghashree, was a student of MET College in Bengaluru when she came into contact with T.K. Swamy of Tirumalapura village in Pandavpura taluk of Mandya district . The two are said to have married, as per Meghashree’s kin.

But the girl apparently did not retain any contact with her parents or relatives after marriage as there was opposition from her family who belong to a village in Malavalli taluk.

But her mother who was pining to see her daughter made efforts to trace Meghashree but it was futile in the absence of any definite address.

“However, she stumbled upon Swamy’s voter’s ID card in an old almirah which was being cleaned ahead of the festival, on Occtober 14. She rushed to Tirumalapura village on October 16 only to be told by the local residents that the girl was murdered by her in-laws five years ago”, according to Y.N. Mamatha, who heads a local human rights and social welfare outfit.

She told The Hindu that it could as well be a case of honour killing as it was an inter-caste marriage.

The police also reopened old files pertaining to unnatural deaths and unidentified bodies to crack the case. A photo of an unidentified woman whose body was found in a canal in 2015 is now under scanner as it resembles Meghashree, according to Mamatha.

The case is now being investigated by a team headed by Srirangapatana Dy SP Arun Nage Gowda. He said they cannot jump to any conclusion at this stage as Swamy claims that he never married the girl though they were in love.

Mr. Nage Gowda said they have gone into the old records and Meghashree’s photo bears no resemblance to the body of a woman retrieved from the canal 5 years ago. “We need to conduct a DNA test and will ensure that the probe is fair’’, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/case-of-dalit-girl-missing-for-5-years-shrouded-in-mystery/article32922212.ece

137,2020/10/22,PU teachers not content with 30% cut in syllabus,"Further cut not on the agenda: DPUE

While the Department of Pre-University Education has reduced syllabi for I and II PU courses by 30%, a section of teachers have demanded further reduction to 50%.

In a circular issued on Wednesday, Snehal R., Director, Pre-University Education, said that the decision to reduce the syllabi was in continuation of the measure to provide recorded video lectures to students affected by the absence of physical classes.

The circular stated that the reduction of syllabi of physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology is as per what the CBSE has done. The CBSE has reduced the syllabi by 30% for classes 1 to 12. The reduction of 30% for 33 subjects is as per the recommendation by members of Text Book Revision Committees. Carnatic music subject has been dropped as no student has taken it for the last two years, the circular said.

Talking to The Hindu, Ms. Snehal said: “We are working on reducing practicals, which will be decided once the physical classes start.” Recorded video lectures and notes are being uploaded on YouTube regularly since July. Ruling out any further reduction, Ms. Snehal said the revised syllabi can be covered in the remaining part of 2020-21 academic year.

Questioning the decision, Madhava Poojary, Principal of R.N. Shetty Pre-University College, Murudeshwar, said the department has revised the syllabi three months after CBSE’s decision. “It is difficult to complete the revised syllabi by January 2021. Either it should be further reduced to 50% or the academic year be extended till April, in order to give justice to students, more to those who have problem in accessing video lessons,” he said. He referred to Uttakoppa village in Bhatkal that has problem with network and 40 students of this village were disconnected from their lectures. “Physical classes are the only recourse for such students. This circular has created undue pressure on students, who have failed to get access to video lectures,” he added.

M. Nagaraj, Secretary of the Bengaluru North Pre-University College Principals’ Association, said as the calendar of events for examination has not yet announced, he hoped the department would extend the academic year and have PU examinations in April.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/k28ibl/article32922177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGLECTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pu-teachers-not-content-with-30-cut-in-syllabus/article32922179.ece

139,2020/10/22,‘Want to be known beyond the identity of being D.K. Ravi’s wife’,"It is important for women to get into electoral politics: Kusuma

For 31-year-old Kusuma H., the transition from the classroom to canvassing in her constituency appears seamless, but she says the two worlds are very different. The Congress candidate from Rajarajeshwari Nagar Assembly constituency in the byelections says while she earlier had to learn and teach from a prescribed syllabus as a lecturer, she now does not have the luxury of saying that questions asked by her voters are “out of syllabus.” Speaking to The Hindu, she talks about her plans for the constituency and how she is striving to carve her own identity. Excerpts:

Do you think it is possible to carve your own identity because people know you as late IAS officer D.K. Ravi’s wife? Now D.K. Suresh, MP, also appears to be in the limelight while campaigning for you.

I am D.K. Ravi’s wife and I cannot change that. What I, however, want is to be known beyond that identity. D.K. Suresh sir is an experienced politician who has done a lot of good work and I do not think I will be overshadowed by him.

Why is it important for women to get into electoral politics?

I come from a family of privilege. Despite that, when my husband died, I had to face several accusations as a woman. I often think about the hardships that women who are not as well placed have to face. Politics is a space where we can reach out to people and it is important for women to take the plunge.

What will be your priorities for the constituency if elected to power?

My priority is to improve affordable healthcare, in the midst of a pandemic. There is economic slowdown and people have lost jobs or seen steep cuts in salaries, which needs to be addressed. I also want to focus on education and environment, issues close to my heart.

Is this your one off attempt in politics or are you are here to stay?

I am here to stay. Winning or losing the elections will not change my motive of wanting to help people.

How do you perceive your chances of winning against BJP candidate Munirathna Naidu, who has won twice from here?

I do not think of how strong or popular my opponent is. I am only trying to focus on how I can reach out and convince people that I will do a good job if elected.

You are foreign educated and come from a family of privilege. Will you be able to understand the problems at grassroots?

People do not know how my initial upbringing was. My father hailed from an agricultural background and was once a bus conductor. I definitely understand the difficulties of people and connect.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/npajxd/article32922153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGKUSUMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/want-to-be-known-beyond-the-identity-of-being-dk-ravis-wife/article32922154.ece

The autopsy, claimed to be the first in India, was done early last week by forensic expert Dinesh Rao, who heads the Department of Forensic Medicine in Oxford Medical College and Research Institute in the city. “I took up the autopsy to understand the disease process and its outcome, and to study if there is a need to modify the treatment protocols. Of the various swabs I took, those from the mouth, throat and nose tested RT-PCR positive, while there was no trace of the virus on the skin of the face, neck, or internal organs like the respiratory passage and lungs. That is because the lung surface was dominated by bacterial infections,” Dr. Rao said.

Virus effect

“The lungs, which are normally like a soft sponge ball, were more like a leather ball. They normally weigh about 600-700 gm, but this victim’s lungs together weighed 2,180 gm and the texture was leathery. There were blood clots and the air sacs were ruptured. It was shocking to see what the virus had done to the lungs,” he said.

“These findings indicate that artificial ventilation or oxygen administration would not have helped the patient. The patient required thrombolytic therapies that involve dissolving the clots in the body first. The air sacs were filled with clots and that had to be dissolved first,” he explained.

Also, going by these findings it is advisable that all COVID-19 bodies should be cremated and not be handed over to families, he said.

Stating that these findings only pertain to a single COVID-19 body, the doctor said: “We need more research to understand the disease process and modify our treatment protocols instead of blindly following what the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends. All guidelines and treatment protocols put out by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) are based on WHO recommendations and international data.

Dr. Rao, who conducted the 1.10-hour autopsy all alone as none were willing to join him, said he only took help to lift the body and keep it on the autopsy table. “There are a few more tests — immunohistochemistry, CT scan of the body, electron microscopic, and virological tests — that I wanted to do but had no facilities. More research is needed in this regard,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/xaced1/article31375821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19TH-SCICORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/autopsy-on-covid-19-body-reveals-virus-active-18-hours-after-death/article32921903.ece
142,2020/10/22,Karnataka shifts scheme from LIC to India Post,"A Cabinet meeting, presided by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, decided to transfer the scheme from the LIC to India Post from 2020-21 owing to low rate of interest in the former.

The State Cabinet on Thursday decided to implement a redesigned Bhagyalakshmi scheme under the Sukanya Samriddhi Account scheme of India Post, instead of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India.

The scheme is aimed at providing financial assistance to a maximum of two girls born into a below poverty line (BPL) family by issuing an insurance bond and its maturity value will be given to the girl at the age of 18.

The scheme was launched during 2006-07 for improving the sex ratio by providing incentives to BPL families with girl children. Under the scheme, the girl will get ₹1 lakh upon attaining the age of 18.

A Cabinet meeting, presided by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, decided to transfer the scheme from the LIC to India Post from 2020-21 owing to low rate of interest in the former.

Owing to the reduced rate of interest, the LIC had asked the State government to deposit the difference in the amount and this led to the scheme being shifted to India Post.

According to official sources, under LIC conditions the State government had to deposit an additional ₹2,000 crore in the name of beneficiaries.

The LIC argued that the premium amount being paid by the government is less, sources said. The government pays a premium of ₹19,350 for the first child and ₹18,350 for the second.

India Post provides an interest rate of 7.6% on deposits under the scheme. The public is allowed to invest a minimum of ₹250 and a maximum of ₹1.5 lakh per year.

The Siddaramaiah government neglected the scheme by reducing the allocation in the State budgets, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has alleged.

Sources said that the Cabinet also discussed the Rajyotsava awards, which will be given out in a simple ceremony this year.

Among other decisions, the Cabinet withdrew a 2018 government order for a French company to establish an unit generating electricity from solid waste at Chikkanagamangala in Bengaluru limits.

To curb illegal depositors’ schemes, operated by chit funds and private firms, the Cabinet also approved the Karnataka Banning of Unregulated Depositors’ Scheme Rules, 2020.

It also approved the Karnataka State Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 2020; the Karnataka State Civil Services (Amendment) Rules, 2020, for recruitment of stenographers typists, and the Karnataka State Civil Services (Amendment) (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 2020, according to official sources.

The Cabinet also approved the revised estimate of ₹26.92 crore for implementing early warning dissemination system in three coastal districts under the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/efkcvt/article31847764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-india-post-postal-department,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-shifts-scheme-from-lic-to-india-post/article32921886.ece
143,2020/10/22,"Post-COVID-19, patients complain of health issues","With growing concern over breathlessness, joint pain, cardiac issues and memory loss, a recovery clinic was launched in Mysuru

After recovering from COVID-19, patients are said to be complaining of problems such as breathlessness, joint pain, chest pain, cardiac related issues and even memory loss.

With nearly 50 per cent of the recovered patients complaining of these issues, a private hospital in Mysuru on Thursday announced the launch of the Post-COVID-19 Recovery Clinic to treat the rising number of patients suffering from mid= and long-term effects of the infection.

The recovery clinic at the Apollo BGS Hospitals in Kuvempunagar will be run by a team of specialists with the help of neurologists and immunologists.

Announcing the clinic at a press conference here on Thursday, hospital’s consultant physician Sanjeev Rao Girimaji said the clinic was launched as many patients had contacted doctors about symptoms they are experiencing and not knowing how to to deal with them. The clinic aims to help patients get specialised care with the guidelines laid down and the clinicians trained to ensure that patients get correct treatment, he added.

COVID-19 can impact vital organs and acute events such as stroke and myocardial infection, and chronic conditions including diabetes and hypertension are a part of the post-COVID conditions. A number of sudden deaths in post-COVID patients had been reported and most of these are attributed to acute cardiac events, a release from the hospital said.

Consultant pulmonologist Madhu K. said COVID-19 attacks not just the lungs but other organs as well and leaves behind lingering health issues. Some of the manifestations occur weeks and months after the treatment.

N.G. Bharateesha Reddy, Vice-President and Unit head, Apollo BGS Hospitals, Mysuru, in the release, said the COVID-19 syndrome is adding to the disease load and if not addressed with special attention will lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality beyond the pandemic among the recovered patients.

144,2020/10/22,"Jamboo Savari: Elephants, others take part in first rehearsal","Thursday’s practice was restricted till Balarama Gate of the palace from the forecourt; two more rehearsals planned for the low-key Vijayadashami procession scheduled on Oct. 26

The first rehearsal for the scaled-down Jamboo Savari on the day of Vijayadashami was conducted on the palace premises on Thursday.

Dasara elephants led by Abhimanyu and a limited number of participants, including the mounted police, were present.

The rehearsal was restricted till the Balarama Gate of the palace.

‘Pattada Ane’ Vikrama and ‘Nishane Ane’ Gopi could not participate in the rehearsal since they were participating in the Dasara related rituals of the Wadiyar family. They are expected to join for the next rehearsals.

Abhimanyu, along with ‘Kumki’ elephants Kaveri and Vijaya, were taken near the elevated rostrum in front of the palace where the police officers standing on the elevated platform showered petals on the elephants to rehearse for the low-key procession.

Abhimanyu would be carrying the 750-kg golden howdah for the first time on the day of Dasara finale on October 26. At the rehearsal on Thursday, Abhimanyu was not carrying the wooden replica of the howdah but the tusker had undertaken weight training with sandbags and the wooden replica since its arrival from the forest camp.

After the showering of flowers on them, the jumbos moved towards the Balarama Gate which were followed by the Mounted Police and other police personnel. The rehearsal ended at the gate.

However, when the rehearsal was about to end, a horse of the mounted police panicked and the rider (policeman) fell off. However, the horse calmed down and the rider climbed back to complete the procession.

The final rehearsal will be conducted on Saturday, a day before the Ayudha Puja, besides another rehearsal scheduled on Saturday.

Sources told The Hindu that a couple of cultural troupes and one or two tableaux are expected to be part of the procession but there was no clarity on it yet.

Entry to the palace for Jamboo Savari will be restricted to less than 300 on advice of the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, Bengaluru. Accordingly, the arrangements would be limited with the seating only for the shortlisted participants, similar to the way it was done for the inauguration atop the Chamundi Hills.

Meanwhile, senior forest veterinarian D.N. Nagaraj, who has been looking after the elephants, told The Hindu that all five elephants were in good health and completed scheduled rehearsals for the big day.

Abhimanyu has been successfully handling the tasks as it was not new for him since such tasks he had carried even before as a stand-by to Arjuna, the outgoing lead elephant, which was retired from the tasks as it turned 60 years. “Abhimanyu is perfectly handling the tasks. All training so far went off smoothly,” the vet said, after the rehearsal.

The Forest Department has full faith that Abhimanyu will pull off the task with perfection as it has been in the elite Dasara jumbo team for over two decades. It is best known for its astuteness in the operations for capturing errant elephants and aged and injured wild tigers straying out of forests. Called an “all-rounder”, the jumbo makes the job easier for the forest authorities with its expertise of tracking the target jumbo in operations because of its quickness on any terrain. Abhimanyu is known to perform its job with finesse, according to forest sources.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jamboo-savari-elephants-others-take-part-in-first-rehearsal/article32919084.ece

146,2020/10/22,Mangalore University establishes facility for Carbon-14 dating of archaeological artefacts,"The Centre for Advanced Research in Environmental Radioactivity (CARER) at Mangalore University has established a facility for Carbon-14 dating of archaeological artefacts or material of biogenic origin based on Liquid Scintillation Counting technique.

Carbon-14 dating is a method for determining the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radiocarbon, a radioactive isotope of carbon. The method was developed in the late 1940s at the University of Chicago by Willard Libby, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to this work in 1960.

Measuring the amount of Carbon-14 in a sample from a dead plant or animal, such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone, provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died, a release from the university said on Thursday.

This facility has been established through financial support from the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE). Through a research project sanctioned by BRNS and with collaboration with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai, the CARER had undertaken a study for standardising the method for Carbon-14 measurements in the vicinity of nuclear power plants, it said.

A team of scientists led by Karunakara N., a professor and coordinator, CARER, in collaboration with BARC has standardised a batch method for the thermal combustion of the samples by tube furnace system for Carbon-14 measurements. The spin-off application of this method is its application for determining the age of the material up to 30,000 years old, the release issued by K. Raju Mogaveera, Registrar (administration), said.

The CARER with state-of-the-art facilities has been established by the university as a national facility through financial support from BRNS. This is an advanced centre for radioecological and radiation protection research in the country with collaborations with many advanced laboratories of the world. The centre is serving the research needs of various research groups from national laboratories/institutions/universities.

147,2020/10/22,HC notice on plea challenging constitutionality of law to protect rights of transgender persons,"The High Court of Karnataka has ordered issue of notice to the Union government in a PIL petition questioning constitutional validity of a series of provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order on the petition filed by Ondede, a public charitable trust working extensively with the transgender community in the State and others.

The petitioners have termed the Sections 4,5,6,7, 12(3), 18(a) and 18(d) of the Act as violative of the fundamental rights of the equity before law, the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, sex or place of birth, the equality of opportunity in matters of public employment, and the protection of life and personal liberty guaranteed respectively under the Articles, 14,15, 16 and 21 of the Constitution.

Pointing out that as per the Section 4, a transgender person shall have a right to be recognised only as ‘transgender’ and not as male, female, or other, the petition has claimed that this compulsion to only identify as ‘transgender’ violates one’s right to gender identify under the Article 21.

Self-determination

The Sections 5, 6 and 7, prescribing process for consideration of application for certificate of identity after considering medical and psychological documents are violation of the apex court’s judgement, in the case of National Legal Services Authority vs Union of India, which had held that gender self-determination cannot be based on medical reassignment or any other procedure, the petitioners have contended.

On minors

The petitioners have also claimed that Section 12 does not make any distinction in treatment between minors and adult transgender persons when they get rejected by their family as they can be assigned to a rehabilitation or to their homes by the orders of a court without giving any third alternative of their own choice if the transgender is not a minor person.

Abuse of transgenders

Section 18 of the Act, which prescribes maximum punishment up to two years in cases of certain offences like physical or sexual abuse of a transgender person, is discriminatory in nature, petitioners have claimed while pointing out that the Indian Penal Code prescribes severe punishment of seven years and above in cases of similar offences against women.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a5cx1v/article32913375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-notice-on-plea-challenging-constitutionality-of-law-to-protect-rights-of-transgender-persons/article32913376.ece
148,2020/10/22,"Issue guidelines for online classes, says Minister","Directive follows reports of students complaining of eye problems

After media reports of children complaining of eye problems due to online classes, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar on Wednesday directed the Commissioner of Department of Public Instruction (DPI) to immediately issue a detailed circular listing measures that can be taken to curtail the problem and formulate guidelines.

“It is being reported in the media that students have been facing eye-related problems as a result of online classes being held across the State. Hence, it is directed to issue a detailed circular on modalities of conducting online classes based on the expert committee report,” the letter by the Education Minister stated.

In its report submitted in the first week of July, the expert committee had recommended an age-appropriate approach for students attending online classes.

V.P. Niranjan Aradhya, educationist and member of the Committee, told The Hindu that a robust mechanism needs to be in place for follow up on the implementation of the report. It was submitted to the government after consulting and deliberating with various stakeholders including doctors. “The overall well-being of students should be accorded utmost priority. In the report, we have also said that after a particular time, the functioning of the system should be revived. It has been three months since we submitted the report and there will be scope for improvement based on experiences,” he said,

Frequency of classes

The committee report had specified the frequency of classes that could be held every week and had recommended that schools could conduct alternative-day classes for students up to Class 2, while five-days-a-week classes were allowed for Class 3 and above. Two days of the week should be strictly non-screen time.

A few parents that The Hindu spoke to said that schools needed to chart out a way to improve ‘offline classes’. “My son’s school is conducting online classes continuously and it’s a strain on his eyes,” said a mother of a Class 7 student enrolled in a private school in Bengaluru.

Other activities

The parents of a teenage boy said their son was experiencing dry eyes or a burning sensation after sitting for online classes continuously. They also admitted that after classes, their son watched TV or played games on his phone as he cannot engage in team sports. “This adds to the problem,” said his father. Many expressed hope that the guidelines will address this problem. “But the government should also monitor schools and ensure that rules are being followed,” said the parents.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ifnd3v/article32913364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGONLINECLASSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/issue-guidelines-for-online-classes-says-minister/article32913365.ece

Every time dark clouds gather overhead, people of Aralagodu Panchayat in Sagar taluk begin to worry. For, they have not yet come to terms with landslips and the destruction caused by heavy rain this August.

Houses were damaged and entire areca plantations disappeared as heavy rain lashed the region for three days from August 4.

Things have been particularly bad for two families of Nandodi village. The State government had sanctioned houses for the families of Sripada and Mahabalagiri as their houses were damaged during heavy rain in August 2019.

The two families were sanctioned ₹5 lakh each. But during the rain this August, the houses that were being built were also damaged. Both the families had got ₹3.5 lakh each and spent it. However, as the structures developed cracks following landslips, the gram panchayat asked them to stop construction.

Prasanna Bhat, son of Mr. Sripada, one of the beneficiaries, told The Hindu, “The old house constructed by my parents 30 years ago was damaged, and now the new one being constructed also developed cracks.” His family has shifted to Sagar.

Similarly, Mr. Mahabalagiri’s family has shifted to Kargal village.

Following landslips in the village, the district administration issued notices to 15 households nearby and asked the residents to shift.

Land was identified for rehabilitation at Kargal. But, the residents refused to shift citing that they could not travel from 12 km to look after areca plantations.“The administration identified the only land available for rehabilitation, but people refused to move there, and gave in writing that they would stay here only,” said R. Praveen Kumar, Panchayat Development Officer of Aralagodu.

However, though they are reluctant to leave the place the families are worried about their safety. Instances of landslips have been reported whenever it rains in the area.

Areca plantation, spread over two acres, was displaced completely at Arodi village in August. Not even one areca tree survived. Somashekhar, owner of the land that was displaced, said he has no alternative land to grow areca. The landslip has taken away the plantation that earned him about ₹2 lakh a year. “I don’t know how the government will compensate my loss. The plantation is over 50 years old. Even if I am allotted an alternative land, it will take years to develop a plantation,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xyppf4/article32913182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/families-in-malnad-villages-reel-under-back-to-back-heavy-rain-landslips/article32913184.ece

Paying tributes to policemen during the Police Martyrs Day at the Police Grounds in Dharwad on Wednesday, Prof. Chetti said that policemen strive hard for maintaining societal health keeping aside their personal life and family interests. Their bravery and valour would lead to creation of a crime-free society, he said.

Lauding the commendable role played by police personnel in the fight against COVID-19, Prof. Chetti said that as police personnel always worked for society, the government should extend additional benefits and perks to them. Superintendent of Police of Dharwad Vartika Katiyar read out the names of the 259 police officials and personnel who lost their lives while on duty during last year and paid tributes to them.

Deputy Superintendent of Police Ravi Naik, Deputy Superintendent of Police Shivanand G.C. and others were present. Led by Reserve Police Inspector G.C. Dooganavar, a DAR platoon conducted a parade and offered gun salute.

The 65-year-old leader passed away on Tuesday.

The hexagenarian, who was said to have recovered from COVID-19, died of severe pneumonia at a private hospital in Solapur, Maharashtra. He is survived by his wife and two sons.

A four-member COVID-19 body disposal team from the Solapur hospital brought the body to his native Ambalga village at noon on Wednesday. All the protocols were followed during the disposal of the body.

Though a large number of people gathered for the funeral, they were not allowed to see the face of the leader for the last time. Party members, activists from various organisations, workers and farmers stood carrying the party flag on either side of the 5-km stretch from Belkota to Ambalga village, where the last rites were performed on government land.

Manpade was the State vice-president of the Karnataka Pranth Raita Sangha. He dedicated his life to fighting for the rights of farmers and workers in the organised and unorganised sectors in the Kalyana Karnataka region. He always criticised the government’s import policies that directly affected local farmers.

District in-charge and Minister for Women and Child Welfare Shashikala Jolle criticised BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal for saying that the party was planning to replace Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa with a leader from North Karnataka.

She said that Mr. Yediyurappa would complete his remaining term of three years in office and there would be no change. He is managing COVID-19 very well and providing calamity relief in a commendable manner, she added.

Mr. Yediyurappa, who was supposed to hold a meeting of officers in Alamatti, cancelled his visit citing bad weather. He flew over some flood-affected areas along the Bhima river in Vijayapura district before conducting an aerial survey over Kalaburagi district.

About Mr. Yatnal’s concern that the Chief Minister had withdrawn ₹ 125 crore released to city corporations, she said that the funds were likely to be restored as the issue was being discussed at the highest level of the government.

She said that the State Cabinet would discuss flood relief and related issues at its next meeting. She said that she would ask her Cabinet colleagues to urge the Union government to declare the floods as a national emergency. That would enable the Centre to provide additional funds to the State, she said.

She said that a committee of senior officers would look into the allegations that Irrigation Department officers had committed an error by which additional water was released from the Sonna barrage on the Bhima river, causing floods in the command areas. On the face of it, it looks as if there has been a mistake. A technical committee will decide it and find out which officers are responsible for lapses, if any, she said.

She said that the government would form a committee to see that irrigation officers from Karnataka and Maharashtra worked in coordination over water discharge and other issues in the Bhima river basin, on the lines of the committee for the Krishna basin.

According to her, 28 villages on the banks of the Bhima were affected and the initial estimate of loss has been put at ₹ 625 crore.

156,2020/10/22,Belagavi GTTC gets new building,"Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan inaugurated the new building of the Government Tool Room and Training Centre in Belagavi during a virtual event on Wednesday.

He hoped that the GTTC with additional facilities would aid the all round development of the district. He said that courses in precision manufacturing and tool and dye making were very popular among students as they guaranteed well-paying jobs.

MLA Abhay Patil said that the State government was committed to increasing the export potential of the city.

Belagavi is already the second biggest exporter in the State after Bengaluru. “We need to make it even stronger. Equipping the GTTC to enable it to produce highly skilled youth is one of the steps towards this,” he said.

He urged the Minister to start more industry relevant courses in the Belagavi GTTC.

157,2020/10/22,An initiative to help needy theatre artistes,"Considering the sorry state of many of the theatre artistes across the State, especially because of the COVID-19 situation, theatre group Veer Kathakar has taken up an initiative to extend a helping hand to needy artistes.

Addressing presspersons here on Tuesday, founder of Veer Kathakar, actor, artist and director Sushma Veer said that as everyone was looking up to the government for help during these difficult times, she was doing her bit within available resources.

KBR Drama Company has, meanwhile, joined hands with her in the efforts.

Ms. Sushma Veer said that Veer Kathakar had taken up the responsibility of providing food kits for three months for nearly 600 needy artistes. It had also started the process of issuing health cards to those who needed healthcare. Ms. Sushma Veer, who is the granddaughter of legendary theatre artiste Gubbi Veeranna, said that she had learnt from her grandfather and family that it was her duty to maintain her family in times of distress, and theatre was her family.

She said that as she had limited resources, she wanted to ensure that help reached the needy. She was cross-checking the veracity of requests for help through organisations suh as KBR Drama Company and other individuals.

“While food and healthcare are the immediate requirements, we also plan to bear educational expenses of the children of theatre artistes once the educational institutions re-start to function,” she said.

Chindodi Srikanthesh and Chindodi Shambhulingappa of KBR Drama Company and theatre artiste Helen Mysuru said that there were several issues concerning artistes, especially after the lockdown and ban on staging plays. The initiative by Veer Kathakar would help in creating a platform where common problems could be addressed.

Ms. Sushma Veer said that apart from just help, the initiative was also aimed at preparing for the coming days, including finding alternative sources of earnings, along with bringing in technology into theatre, among others.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/l3hqa1/article32912779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21HBHELPARTISTES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/an-initiative-to-help-needy-theatre-artistes/article32912780.ece

Although the IUML has denied any tie-up with the Welfare Party, Mr. Kunhalikutty had hinted at making electoral adjustments with regional groups and parties for the local body elections.

159,2020/10/22,Police congress delves into new technologies,"Officers must be trained in modern trends, says Pinarayi

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the second Police Science Congress organised online by the Kerala Police Academy on Thursday.

The event is an extension of the first congress held in November 2019 to provide a common platform to various police forces/units, social scientists, forensic experts, and technocrats, to deliberate on selected themes of interest to the Indian police.

Mr. Vijayan described the meet as quite appropriate for the times. “Awareness of forensic science, forensic medicine, cybersecurity, and other emerging technologies in policing and a thorough knowledge of law have become indispensable for members of any investigating agencies these days.”

He said the Kerala Police Academy was resolved to train police officers in modern trends in relevant fields so that effective policing would result. Organising research-based congresses would help in that regard.

Staying true to its commitment to law and order and preserving communal harmony, the Kerala government wanted to transform the police academy into a centre of excellence in police science and research. “This will scale up the training given to our police personnel and enable Kerala Police to further improve its record as one of the premier investigating agencies in the country,” the Chief Minister said.

He expressed hope that the presentations, research papers, and deliberations of the Congress would contribute to the policing fraternity and decision-makers across the country.

State Police Chief Loknath Behera presided. Director of Kerala Police Academy B. Sandhya welcomed the delegates. Neeraj Kumar Gupta, DIG (Training) proposed the vote of thanks.

P.S. Sathidevi, Director in Charge of the NIT-Calicut; M.K. Jayaraj, Vice Chancellor of the University of Calicut; K.C.

160,2020/10/22,Tourism in Pala gets a boost,"CM opens Green Tourism Complex in town

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday inaugurated the Meenachil River View Park and Green Tourism Complex in Pala town as part of the Green Tourism Circuit, which connects visitor attractions and pilgrimage centres across the high ranges of Kottayam and Idukki.

The main attraction of the project, the first of its kind by the Tourism Department, is the Green Tourism Complex that has come up at the point where the Lalam stream converges with the Meenachil river. The bridge that connects to the complex is built on the lines of the London Bridge.

It also has an underground structure having a glass roof, similar to the Love Museum in Paris. The authorities have also set up a snack bar, open conference area, river viewing platform, and electric lighting in the complex.

The project was kick-started during the tenure of K.M Mani as minister in the previous UDF government. It, however, got a fresh lease of life following the election of Mani C. Kappan as the legislator of Pala.

According to officials, the Green Tourism Circuit aims to connect the tourist destinations and pilgrimage centres in the eastern region of Kottayam with Pala as its gateway.

The first phase of the project, which received administrative sanction in 2013, envisages construction of pilgrim amenities at Ramapuram Nalambalam, Bharananganam Sri Krishnaswamy Temple, Edappadi Anandashanmukha Swamy Temple, and Ezhacheri Uma Maheshwara Temple.

Land has been made available at Ilaveezhapoonchira and Illikkal Kallu in Meenachil taluk and at Kulamavu and Kumili in Idukki for expansion of the project.

The Green Tourism Circuit Society was revamped in 2017 with the Tourism Minister as its chairman.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran presided over the programme, via videoconferencing.

The government is yet to make the report public although it was submitted on Wednesday. When contacted, Mr. Nambiar said he would comment on the report only after the government made it public.

The committee was asked to examine whether the privacy of personal and sensitive data of individuals have been adequately protected, whether adequate procedures have been followed while finalising the arrangements with Sprinklr and whether deviations, if any, are fair, justified and reasonable considering the extraordinary and critical situation the State was facing at the relevant period.

163,2020/10/22,KIIFB aid to RTC for buying 360 buses,"50 of these vehicles will be electric and the rest CNG-powered

The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) will provide ₹286.50 crore to the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) for purchasing 360 new buses.

Of the new buses, 50 will be electric ones that will operate as Fast Passenger and the remaining 310 will be powered by CNG and will run as Super Fast.

The government accorded nod for the purchase of the new buses after the KIIFB board meeting under Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had cleared the proposal, Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran said on Thursday.

The 50 electric buses will cost ₹27.50 crore and the subsidy under FAME 2 will be used for the purchase. The remaining ₹259 crore will be made available by KIIFB as loan to the KSRTC at a nominal interest of 4%.

A green effort

Mr. Saseendran said the initiative was part of the government effort to make Thiruvananthapuram city green. The government’s aim was to ensure that only CNG, LNG and electric buses plied the roads of the State capital in another three years.

A CNG pump has been set up at the IOC depot at Anayara and oil majors are undertaking studies for opening CNG pumps in other districts. While the high speed diesel costs ₹71 a litre, the CNG costs ₹57.3 and LNG ₹44 a litre. A 30% shift in fuel will lead to huge savings for the KSRTC.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kiifb-aid-to-rtc-for-buying-360-buses/article32920185.ece

165,2020/10/22,Lockdown uncovers a birds’ haven in rail colony,"Palakkad divisional manager photographs around five dozen species

The Southern Railway Colony at Hemambika Nagar near here is a haven for birds. But it took a pandemic and a lockdown for the railway officials to uncover that haven.

Dozens of bird species were identified and recorded in the Railway Colony during the lockdown, thanks to Divisional Railway Manager Pratap Singh Shami’s hobby in photography.

“The birds I found here are testimony to the general saying that Palakkad is one of the most beautiful divisions of the Indian Railways,” said Mr. Shami.

Indian grey hornbills

Staff too

Mr. Shami introduced the concept of “backyard birding” among his staff as most of them got stuck at home during the lockdown. He said he was surprised to find so many beautiful birds perching on the trees around his bungalow.

According to M.K. Gopinath, Palakkad Railway Division’s public relations officer, more than five dozen species could be identified and photographed during the lockdown. “We were surprised to find so many varieties of birds,” he said.

Main residents

Among them were Indian grey hornbills, Asian koels, black-headed and golden orioles, different types of myna and bulbul, purple-rumped sunbird, rufous treepies, sparrows, many types of kites and hawks including marsh harrier and shikra, varieties of drongos, bee-eaters, herons, egrets, owls, nightjars, woodpeckers, parrots, peacocks and babblers.

Using his Nikon P-1000 super-telephoto amateur camera, Mr. Shami shot several dozens of them from his house. “I did not have to even go out of my house to find such a great variety. Describing this place a mere haven for birds will be an understatement,” he said, playing the video of the birds he chronicled.

Admitting that he was neither a serious birdwatcher nor a photographer, Mr. Shami said the birds helped him develop a fresh interest in nature and photography.

Mr. Shami said Palakkad used to be widely appreciated as a beautiful division in Railways. “It is like living in a green mansion with colourful birds playing their mesmerising music all along,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dqt9pi/article32919896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23tvmpm-Black-headed-oriole,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lockdown-uncovers-a-birds-haven-in-rail-colony/article32919900.ece
166,2020/10/22,No nod for prosecution in KSDC graft case,"CBI had registered a case against officials alleging corruption in purchase

The State government has refused to give sanction to prosecute Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation (KSCDC) officials, notably its former chairman and Congress leader R. Chandrasekharan, in a case registered by the CBI in connection with the alleged corruption in the tendering and purchase of raw cashew during the period of the previous United Democratic Front (UDF) government.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan denied the allegation that Mr. Chandrasekharan’s alleged proximity to him had saved the veteran Congress trade unionist from prosecution by the CBI.

Mr. Vijayan said the government’s decision was neither off the cuff nor motivated by any personal interest. It was based on the merit of the legal opinion received by the government. The administration examined the CBI’s finding in detail and found them to be flawed and without legal basis.

The KSCDC had merely followed a time-tested procurement practice that was the norm internationally. Its board had approved the decisions. The procurement guaranteed employment for cashew workers during the 2013-15 period.

The High Court had ordered an inquiry into the alleged scam in 2015 given its international ramifications. The CBI had reportedly found that procedural violations, opacity in tender modalities, and possible attempts to fix bids had cost the public exchequer ₹600 crore and accorded a corresponding benefit to cashew suppliers and their middlemen.

The CBI had reportedly found that the KSCDC had purchased raw cashew at higher than prevailing international market rates. Lack of accurate price data on cashew had allegedly resulted in opaqueness in procurement.

It also allegedly found that the order to the original bidder had changed hands multiple times through contracts on High Sea Sales (HSS), raising the possibility of fraud in the tendering process and money laundering.

The CPI(M) had also agitated against the KSCDC on the issue in Kollam district. It had made the allegations against the KSCDC an election issue in the 2016 Assembly elections that saw significant victories for the LDF in the cashew procession region.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-nod-for-prosecution-in-ksdc-graft-case/article32919869.ece
167,2020/10/22,Corpn. inspects IUML MLA’s house,"As per directive from ED in ₹25-lakh briber case

A Town Planning Department team attached to the Kozhikode Corporation carried out an inspection at the house and its premises of Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) legislator K.M. Shaji near the civil station here on Thursday.

The inspection was carried out on the basis of a directive from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) which is probing a bribery case of sanctioning Plus Two courses for an aided school at Azhikode in Kannur district in 2014.

The case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act was that Plus Two courses were sanctioned to the school after collecting a bribe of ₹25 lakh from the management. A notice has been served on Mr. Shaji to be present for questioning him next month.

Violations

Sources said that documents showed that the house in Vengeri revenue village was in the possession of Asha, wife of Mr. Shaji, and that permission for its construction had been granted in 2013.

But the approval had been granted to construct the house for a space of 3,200 sq ft. Now the total space of construction was found to be 5,500 sq ft.

Besides the owner had not secured the occupancy certificate from the civic authorities. The house had a temporary electricity connection. No Corporation taxes had been paid till now, the sources said.

At the time of inspection, Mr. Shaji and his wife were not present at the house. A report on the inspection would be submitted to the ED before October 27, the sources said.

ED officials had already collected the statements of IUML leaders, including State general secretary K.P.A. Majeed and Kannur district general secretary Abdul Kareem Cheleri, in connection with the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/corpn-inspects-iuml-mlas-house/article32919789.ece
168,2020/10/22,LDF admits Mani faction into the coalition,"Congress, BJP slam it as political trading

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) on Monday inducted the Jose. K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) into the ruling coalition.

Mr. Mani’s inclusion comes barely four months after the United Democratic Front (UDF) announced that the faction had lost the right to continue in the front.

Bickering over the chairpersonship of the Kottayam district panchayat with the KC(M) group headed by P.J. Joseph had paved the way for Mr. Mani’s acrimonious exit from the UDF and subsequent entry into the LDF.

The Communist Party of India (CPI) and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) were initially unsympathetic to the proposal.

The CPI(M) leadership smoothened out the process by persuading the CPI and the NCP to shed their frostiness towards Mr. Mani. It also managed to overcome the CPI suggestion to test Mr. Mani’s electoral sway in Central Travancore in the upcoming local body elections before admitting him into the coalition.

The Election Commission of India’s decision toe award the ‘Two Leaf’ symbol to Mr. Mani also hastened his admittance.

Oppn. flays it

The Congress maintained that the arrangement was patently incongruous. The CPI(M) and the KC(M) had differed on every political issue for the last 39 years. Both parties did not see eye-to-eye at the grassroots level. KC(M) workers would reject the pact Mr. Mani has struck with the CPI(M), Congress sources said.

The Bharathiya Janata Party (BJP) said political expediency and not principle had prompted the LDF to embrace Mr. Mani.

LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan denied that Mr. Mani’s inclusion was political trading ahead of the elections. The KC(M) had joined the LDF unconditionally to advance the secular and pro-farmer policies of the front. The admittance of the KC(M) was a watershed in the history of coalition politics in Kerala, he said.

It signalled that the traditional base of the KC(M) had abandoned the Congress-led UDF for the LDF. They despised the UDF for playing second fiddle to the BJP, and their ire will reflect in elections, he said.

LDF claim

Mr. Mani’s entry has improved the fighting chances of the LDF in the citadels of the UDF. The expansion of the front would ensure a second consecutive term for the LDF government, he claimed.

Mr. Vijayaraghavan also dispelled scepticism that the KC(M) and the Left parties would make uneasy bedfellows given their decades-old political antagonism.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2n8qhi/article32924788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mani,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ldf-admits-mani-faction-into-the-coalition/article32919438.ece
169,2020/10/22,State seek Centre’s nod to cull wild boars,"Provision sought to save crops from extensive damage

The government has commenced steps to seek the Centre’s nod to declare wild boars as ‘vermin’ under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, to cull the animal.

The Chief Wildlife Warden has directed Divisional Forest Officers (DFOs) to identify clusters or regions that have witnessed instances of man-animal conflict and extensive crop damage to enforce the provision and kill the boars en masse.

Forest Minister K. Raju said the Forest Department had struggled to rein in the menace of wild boars owing to the stringent provisions of the law. Nevertheless, the government had recently permitted their killing by forest officials and farmers possessing licensed guns, subject to a number of clauses.

While several wild boars had been killed by way of the order, their population continued to remain above worrying proportions, necessitating further steps to considerably bring down their number by declaring them as vermin. Large sections of the farming community had raised concern over the efficacy of the recent order, considering only few farmers possessed licenced guns.

Considering the unlikelihood of the Centre permitting the culling of boars across the State, the government had commenced steps to seek permission for clusters, mainly hilly and forest fringe areas, Mr. Raju said in a statement.

According to official statistics, the wild boar population had increased from 40,425 in 1997 to 60,940 in 2002, but slumped to 48,034 in 2011. However, the State was roughly estimated to be home to over 55,000 wild boars at present, sources said.

Besides permitting the culling of wild boars in certain States, the Centre has declared other animals, including nilgai (or blue bull) and rhesus macaque, as vermin for specific periods in the recent past.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-seek-centres-nod-to-cull-wild-boars/article32919432.ece

171,2020/10/22,Special judge to decide on plea for court change today,"Prosecution’s petition in female actor rape case

The special judge trying the female actor rape case may decide on the prosecution’s application seeking time for change of court on Friday even as the trial in the case has come to a halt for over a week.

A. Sureshan, the special public prosecutor, had moved an application before the Additional Special Sessions Court (SPE/CBI)-3, Ernakulam, which is hearing the case, last Thursday seeking the transfer of trial to another court as he felt that fair trial would not be possible in the court.

He alleged that the trial court was acting in a “highly biased,” manner, which was “detrimental to the judicial system and to the entire prosecution.” He also feared that justice would be denied to the survivor in the case if the case was tried before the present court.

Report sought

Meanwhile, the trial court is understood to have sought a report from the investigating officer on why the special public prosecutor was absent for conducting the trial. The official was also repeatedly directed by the court on Thursday to make arrangements for the renewal of the trial as the proceedings had to be completed within the deadline fixed by the Supreme Court.

Actor Dileep, has been arraigned as the eigth accused in the case, in which seven others were accused of abducting and raping a female actor in a moving car.

As the court resumed its business on Thursday, the counsel representing the special public prosecutor informed the court that it was in the process of moving the Kerala High Court for changing the trial court.

However, the special judge informed the prosecution that the trial could not be put on hold indefinitely on the ground that it was planning to move the High Court. The judge also indicated that eight days had elapsed after the prosecution first informing the court about its decision to approach the High Court.

Dileep’s petition

It also posted the petition of Dileep against media houses for allegedly reporting the proceedings of the case for hearing on Friday.

At the same time, sources indicated that the prosecution has appraised the State government and the officials concerned of its apprehension regarding the conduct of trial before the Special Court.

Though the prosecution had filed a complaint regarding the developments in the trial court before the Registrar General of the High Court, it was yet to move a petition in the High Court.

172,2020/10/22,Kannur varsity to launch Green Computing initiative,"Project to use SMAASH PC to reduce carbon emission, save power

The Department of Information and Technology at Kannur University will launch a ‘Complete Green Computing Initiative’ at its central computing facility built on the Mangattuparambu campus.

The project, which is part of the Make in India initiative, will use SMAASH PC and Smart Power Station manufactured by ITI Palakkad. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the project through videoconferencing on October 27.

Vice Chancellor Gopinath Ravindran said the university would be able to save about 144,000 units of electricity and reduce its carbon emission by 102 metric tons in five years through the Green Computing initiative .

He said all the computers in the students’ amenity centre would be using SMAASH PC.

The Vice Chancellor further said that even if 10% of the new desktop installations were powered by a Smart Power Station, it could save 10 million units of grid power per year.

While desktop computers used 150 watts, the power consumption of the ITI SMAASH PC was just 35 watts, he said.

Mr. Ravindran observed that installing a single SMAASH PC with a solar panel could eliminate 267 kilograms of carbon production per year. Consumption of eco-friendly products could also reduce waste generation, he said.

The inauguration will be attended by Minister of Higher Education K.T. Jaleel, Member of Parliament Rajmohan Unnithan, T.V. Rajesh, MLA, and syndicate members.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kannur-varsity-to-launch-green-computing-initiative/article32919126.ece
173,2020/10/22,"Case against Kummanam, 8 others for fraud","Aranmula native alleges he was cheated of ₹36 lakh by the accused

Senior BJP leader from Kerala and former Mizoram Governor Kummanam Rajasekharan has landed in a controversy after the Aranmula police in Pathanamthitta booked a case against him and eight others for allegedly defrauding a person of several lakhs of rupees.

Acting on a complaint lodged by C.R. Harikrishnan, a native of Aranmula, a case has been registered against nine persons, including Mr. Rajsekharan, for cheating and criminal breach of trust.

Praveen V Pillai, former private secretary of the former BJP State president is the prime accused while Mr. Rajasekharan has been arraigned as the fourth accused.

The other accused in the case were identified as Vijayan, Xavier, N. Hari Kumar, Krishnaveni, Dalia, Saniya and Raniya.

The case

As per the case, the accused had allegedly collected ₹36 lakh from the complainant on the pretext of making him a partner in a factory unit to be opened in Palakkad. Despite repeated requests, the accused allegedly refused to hand him over the share certificate.

After several rounds of mediation, the accused had returned the complainant a part of his investment but refused to give back the remaining amount.

As the fraud came to light, Mr. Harikrishnan had lodged a complaint with the Pathanamanthitta District police Chief, who in turn referred the case to the police station concerned.

According to the complainant, he had met the first accused in the presence of Mr. Rajasekharan, who encouraged him to invest in the proposed business venture.

Cases have been registered against the accused under IPC Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and IPC 34 (Criminal act in furtherance of common intentions)'', confirmed a senior police officer.

Denies charge

Meanwhile, Mr. Rajasekharan responded that the case was politically motivated and he came to know about it only through the media.

“I am no way connected to any financial transactions and it is unfortunate that the police are attempting to frame me in this case at somebody’s behest,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/case-against-kummanam-8-others-for-fraud/article32919101.ece
174,2020/10/22,Travancore Heritage backwater tourism circuit soon,"₹8.85 crore project to link Kadinamkulam and Anchuthengu lakes

The work for the Travancore backwater cruise heritage tourism circuit linking the brackish-water Kadinamkulam Lake, the biggest inland waterbody in the capital district, and Anchuthengu lake will begin soon.

Inaugurating the Perumathura beach development work on Wednesday, Minister for Tourism and Decaswoms Kadakampally Surendran said the ₹8.85 crore backwater tourism circuit would give a big boost to tourism in the capital and increase footfall.

Boat jetties will be constructed at Murukkumpuzha, Poundukadavu, Kayikkkarakadavu, Panayilkadavu, and Puthenkadavu. A welcome arch will also be constructed at Veli.

Once the tourism circuit is developed, cruise from Kadinamkulam Lake to Akathumuri is possible if houseboats and speedboats are introduced.

Anjengo Fort, Lighthouse, Asan Memorial, Kayikkara, and historical places will form part of the circuit involving two lakes with Perumathura, 29 km north of Thiruvananthapuram.

Varkala beach

The Minister said Kerala Tourism had kicked off the Phase I of the comprehensive development of the Varkala beach at a cost of ₹9 crore. In addition, projects worth ₹2.66 crore had been completed at Varkala as part of improving the infrastructure facilities.

At Perumathura, Kerala Tourism will construct a road, children’s park, ticket counter, pavillion, walkway, stage, snacks bar, rest rooms, boundary wall, and a life guard room at a cost of ₹3 crore. The Minister said the the work at Perumathura will be completed by May 2021.

175,2020/10/22,Master plan for Munroe Thuruthu,"To protect wetland ecosystem while promoting development

The Munroe Thuruthu grama panchayat has prepared a draft master plan to mitigate the environmental challenges and protect the wetland ecosystem while promoting development.

An Assembly committee that studied the environmental issues of Munroe Thuruthu had recommended a specific master plan for the area. The draft was completed with the approval of the District Planning Committee while the Department of Town and Country Planning provided the technical support.

The plan was prepared after conducting a land utilisation survey and socio-economic survey that covered all families residing in the panchayat.

The panchayat plans to take a big leap forward with the completion of various bridges connecting the island to the mainland. The Perumon-Pezhumthuruth bridge, Kannangattu bridge, Munroe Thuruthu-Thevalakkara bridge, Arinallur bridge, Pattamthuruthu East- Kidapram South bridge and a number of roads are expected to give a major boost to tourism in the island.

Along with ensuring all amenities for tourists, steps will be taken not to disturb the fragile ecology of the island. While the master plan focusses on rural tourism, chances of lightweight construction will be explored to protect vulnerable areas.

Due to the specific topography of the island, people residing in 50% of land area will have to be shifted to 28% of land in near future as per Coastal Regulation Zone rules. Some areas in the island are facing the threat of submergence, making it impossible to construct anything in a huge portion of the island.

“So the master plan recommends some changes in the norms so that the residents can go for some eco-friendly methods of construction. Another recommendation is constructing houses and more infrastructure facilities to accommodate more families and tourists. Suggestions to opt for land pooling and joint townships are also there,” says Binu Karunakaran, panchayat president.

The panchayat also plans to promote agriculture, fish farming, livestock farming, and traditional industries to expedite overall development of the island.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dl56ch/article32922414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23tvko-Munroe-Island-3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/master-plan-for-munroe-thuruthu/article32918983.ece
176,2020/10/22,Kerala’s COVID-19 case graph shows sliding trend,"Citing the pattern of the curve elsewhere and the disease nature, experts warn against lowering guard too soon

For the first time since the pandemic curve started its upward growth in Kerala in September first week, the COVID-19 case graph in Kerala is on the decline.

Current disease trends show the effective reproductive number (R) to be less than 1, meaning that the cases will continue to decline. (R is the average number of secondary cases per infectious case in a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible hosts). However, it might be way too early to assume that the worst is over.

“Going by the nature of the disease and the pattern of the curve seen internationally, every time there is a dip, another crest is just beyond the corner. This pattern of a dip-plateau-crest will continue in repeat cycles till the case numbers really go down,” a public health professional says. He does not expect life to normalise before March next.

After a dip during September first week (the dip was in the post-Onam period when testing had also gone down), Kerala’s case graph has been growing continuously. The first dip following that surge is being witnessed now.

Epidemiologists point out that in many districts, the weekly case growth, when compared to the State’s weekly moving average in the current week, has been in the negative. Also, the State’s active case pool has not been growing, as the number of new cases added on daily is being stabilised by as many or more number of recoveries.

The graph has been definitely on the way down in Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam at least for the past 10 days, while Pathanamthitta, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Kannur, and Kasaragod have also been reporting negative growth. However, Malappuram and Palakkad reported over 10% growth last week than in the previous week.

World over, cities have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 crisis, with the transmission focussed in urban areas first and then slowly moving to rural areas. The pattern has been similar in Kerala too, all five districts with maximum cases have city corporations.

The cases are more in the Malappuram-Palakkad belt now. Soon, the “visible” disease transmission hub will shift to Malappuram, while transmission at a lower intensity will continue throughout the rural areas in all districts, it is projected.

“The current disease dynamics, however, will sustain only if we maintain our general vigil,” a senior epidemiologist says.

The epidemic curve will naturally come down once a chunk of the susceptible population is affected but now that almost all cases are locally acquired infections, it will not take much for a local cluster to form and the disease curve to rise again.

The State will have to maintain high vigil as the upcoming Sabarimala pilgrimage and local body elections are definitely two events which will in all likelihood change the trajectory of the epidemic curve, experts warn.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uwjefd/article32234626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-kerala-corona-pti,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/states-case-graph-shows-sliding-trend/article32918914.ece
177,2020/10/22,SNGOU will also focus on science courses: VC,"‘Laboratory facilities of govt., aided colleges will be utilised’

The Sree Narayana Guru Open University (SNGOU) will utilise the laboratory and other facilities of government and aided colleges to offer science courses, Vice Chancellor of the fledgling university P.M. Mubarak Pasha has said.

Pointing out that the absence of practical classes had resulted in such courses finding few takers in other open universities, Dr. Pasha said the State’s strong network of arts and science colleges, affiliated to various universities, could be leveraged to circumvent hurdles associated with offering science courses through the distance education mode.

“We intend to designate well-equipped colleges as programme centres across the State to conduct practical classes on weekends. Considering that arts and science colleges spend 12 hours for laboratory sessions in a semester on an average for science courses, we hope to ensure an equal or greater duration within semesters that are 16 weeks long. Besides utilising the college facilities, the services of their faculty members will also be roped in for conducting the practical sessions,” Dr. Pasha told The Hindu.

The open university also plans to adopt a blended pedagogical approach that will enable it to disseminate offline modules through the virtual learning mode. Study materials that include tutorial videos and documents will be made accessible for students for a certain period, possibly for the duration of the course. “While the feature will be beneficial for large sections than live sessions owing to connectivity issues, we also intend to facilitate interactive sessions with teachers to supplement the learning process,” he said.

Dr. Pasha, who assumed charge at the helm of the university along with Pro Vice Chancellor S.V. Sudheer and Registrar P.N. Dileep on Monday, said he hoped to overcome the teething challenges through collective efforts. He said the university, named after Sree Narayana Guru, would stay true to the ideals propagated by the social reformer. While ensuring top priority for equality and accessibility, the university would strive to uphold quality, he said.

While efforts were currently on to constitute the Boards of Studies, the university will take a call on courses that could be launched immediately following discussions with Higher Education Department officials next week.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/h4tw1e/article32919264.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201022-WA0027,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sngou-will-also-focus-on-science-courses-vc/article32918870.ece

183,2020/10/22,COVID triggers mental health issues among elderly,"More than six months into the pandemic, the COVID-19-induced social isolation has triggered a spate of mental health issues in the elderly.

Helplines opened by the Social Justice Department receive hundreds of calls a day from senior citizen who are grappling with mood disorders and depression as their whole worlds have been turned upside down.

From loneliness and lack of social interaction to missing grandchildren and weekly church service, the older adults find it very difficult to cope with the new post-pandemic routine.

Lack digital literacy

Moreover, many of them lack digital literacy and are dependent on others for a broader array of services.

""We receive around 200 incoming calls from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and we reach out to more than 1,500 persons a day. There are elderly people who get in touch with us when they get anxiety attacks and several persons break down during the calls. Based on their issue, we forward the calls to counsellors. Though the call centre service was started for two months, it may be extended depending on the situation,"" says Alan Antony, an official coordinating the calls.

Team of volunteers

In each district, a team of volunteers and counsellors keep a tab on all elderly based on the data provided by the department. They mainly focus on persons who live alone or whose children fail to provide for them.

""A majority of them had been going out on a regular basis before the pandemic and missing social life has been very hard on some. They feel very suffocated and most of them complain about insomnia, palpitations and excessive nervousness,"" says Smitha S, psychologist.

There are also some persons who are worried about falling sick or contracting the virus.

""A neighbour testing positive or the death of a peer will generate fear and psychological trauma in them.""

Call centre number

The department has circulated the call centre number through media and instructed ASHA workers and anganwadi teachers to connect all elderly persons with the facility.

According to volunteers, there are calls that continue for hours as the elderly persons find it very comforting to talk to someone. But there is also some who have no access to phones, the only link to the world outside.

Domestic abuse

""If the parents don't have phones, we call up the children and arrange a convenient time. Based on a set of questions, our volunteers decide what kind of service they need and if they need regular follow-ups. There are also persons who face domestic abuse from their children and caregivers.

184,2020/10/22,"Print me a cookie, please! How KAU is exploring food of the future","Varsity’s 3D food printing project focusses on promoting local produce

A packet of 3D-printed cookies with a dash of cardamom and pepper or cinnamon and cloves looks closer to reality than ever before as the Kerala Agricultural University’s business incubation centre firmly explores 3D food printing using a combination of locally available ingredients.

The incubation centre was looking at several combinations for the 3D food printing project, said head of the centre K.P. Sudheer on Wednesday.

Vice Chancellor R. Chandra Babu said the incubation centre was leading the efforts to build an economy founded on local produce. “Vocal for Local is the motto as we help farmers and entrepreneurs with identifying potential produce, processing, value addition, branding and marketing,” he said.

Among emerging trends, experts say, 3D food printing will revolutionise the way we eat. Automatic food tellers and instant chapatis look primitive before food printers, churning out, layer by layer, the ‘masala dosa’ of one’s imagination with the choicest of colours, flavour, shape and nutrition.

C. Anandharamakrishnan, director of the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology, Thanjavur, cited reports that said 3D printing could achieve a market volume of around $30 billion by 2022.

He told The Hindu on Wednesday that the institute had, over the past two years, identified and optimised printing and post-processing conditions for a range of food materials and food/agro materials.

“We now work on various aspects of technology scale-up and other allied fields, popularising the technology across the country,” he said.

Established in 2014, the KAU agri business incubation centre is backed by the World Bank, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Kerala and Union governments as part of the National Agricultural Higher Education Project and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana-Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sectors Rejuvenation.

Innovations

The centre has been engaged in developing new techniques, hand-holding entrepreneurs and funding them through various government schemes.

Its successes include the development of a technique for vacuum frying chips, which ensures product quality as well as enables reuse of the frying medium up to sixty times against the conventional single use.

The centre has developed a sensor-based fruit sorter, a machine to slice through jackfruit, a vegetable and fruit slicer-cum-dicer and a fruit and vegetable blancher.

Other innovations include a bee wax-based solution in bran oil as a healthy coating substitute for conventional products.

The vacuum impregnation method to preserve fruits as well as a technology to make pulp, jam and ice-cream from fruits have been developed at the centre. A method to produce powder from banana stems, which has great medicinal qualities, is a major breakthrough.

The centre has developed a technique to produce gluten-free pasta from medicinal quality rice varieties like Njavara and Raktasaali as well as rice flakes; a mini parboiling machine that can easily be handled by women; retort pouches for long-term storage of food items; and a method for preparing ready-to-eat snacks from dried elephant foot yam and moringa combination.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hjtq4t/article32912344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/biscuitki21,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/print-me-a-cookie-please-how-kau-is-exploring-food-of-the-future/article32912345.ece

Aaron Sorkin’s The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a slice of 1960s' America. The movie, which is currently streaming on Netflix, shows the trial of eight anti-war activists (one would be given a mistrial and taken out of the proceedings), representing the different streams of the anti-war movement of the decade. They were charged by federal prosecutors with conspiracy and crossing State lines with the intention of inciting riots. Sorkin, known for his dialogue-heavy dramas, has dramatised real-life incidents to show how a vengeful administration and a corrupt system dealt with dissent in the U.S.

Also read: ‘The Trial of the Chicago 7’ movie review: A spectacular white-knuckle thrill ride

The Chicago protests and the ensuing police violence took place in August 1968 when the Democratic National Convention was under way in the city. It was one of the bloodiest years in post-war America. The country was dealing with many upheavals. And Sorkin has drawn out the political context clearly in The Trial of the Chicago 7 understanding which is important in understanding the movie itself. Predominantly, there are five historical layers in the movie.

Vietnam war

The American invasion of Vietnam and the anti-war movement at home loom large in the background of the The Trial. The protesters, from counterculture activists to students, assembled in Chicago to demonstrate against the war. The context is that 1968 was an election year. U.S. troops in Vietnam peaked during the year with President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, sending more soldiers, taking the total number of U.S. troops to 549,000. It was also the deadliest year of the Vietnam war for the U.S. and its allies. During the year, 27,915 troops of the U.S.-allied South Vietnam and 16,592 American troops were killed. The body bags of soldiers reaching the country intensified the protests in the U.S. Tom Hayden, one of the anti-war protesters who were charged by the federal prosecutors along with others, reading out the names of the fallen soldiers in Vietnam during the course of the trial, in the courtroom, in defiance of the judge, captures the spirit and essence of the anti-war movement.

Radicalisation of blacks

On April 4, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, by a white racist gunman. The murder led to widespread riots across the States in which dozens of were killed and thousands injured. Several black communities were ravaged by violence. Two months later, Robert F. Kennedy, a Democratic Presidential candidate who was making waves in the campaign with his strong anti-war, pro-poor positions, was assassinated by a Jordanian gunman of Palestine origin. The assassinations of Dr. King and Kennedy were a setback to the gradualist movements that were pushing for reforms and policy changes through the democratic means, and contributed to the radicalisation of the youth.

The Black Panther Party, founded by Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton in 1966, focussed on self-defence, in sharp contrast to Dr. King’s non-violent methods. The assassination of Dr. King only strengthened the resolve of the panthers to militantly organise the Black youth against police violence and racism. Sorkin brings these widening fault lines among the Black power movement to the movie. Seale, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, says: “Dr. King... is dead. He has a dream? Now he has a f*****g bullet in his head. Martin is dead, Malcolm [X] is dead. Medgar [Evers] is dead. Bobby [Kennedy] is dead. Jesus is dead. They tried peacefully, we are going to try something different.”

Structural racism

Seale was only briefly in Chicago when the riots took place, but he was also charged with conspiracy to incite riots. Sorkin tells the viewers how John Mitchell’s prosecutors exploited the panthers in the case. “I’m not with them. And speaking frankly, the US attorney wanted a Negro defendant to scare the jury. I was thrown in to make the group look scarier,” Seale shouts in the courtroom on one occasion. The judge repeatedly denies him the rights to speak in the court-room. And the brutal treatment meted out to Seale — he beaten, chained and gagged — shows how racist American courts were in the 1960s. Not just that, a member of the jury who had a James Baldwin book, was taken out of the trial. The killing of Fred Hampton, the socialist activist who was leading the Illinois chapter of the Panther, is a critical moment in the movie, which throws Seale off balance in the courtroom.

Counterculture movement

Two of the Chicago 7, Abbie Hoffman (played by the brilliant Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin, belonged to the counterculture revolutionary Youth International Party (also known as Yippies). The counterculture movement was an anti-establishment cultural movement that celebrated Bohemianism, and the hippie and other alternative lifestyles. The movement swept through the U.S. in the 1960s. The Yippies joined the civil rights movement and the anti-war protests, and used theatrics to mock America’s political leadership, such as naming a pig (Pigasus the Immortal) as a presidential candidate for the 1968 elections. Hoffman’s dark wits and satirical takes on the American judiciary lightens up the otherwise tense moments of the court-room scenes in the movie. In one scene, when Hoffman was asked if he has contempt for the government, he responds: ‘I think the institutions of our democracy are wonderful things that right now are populated by some terrible people.”

Resentment against Democrats

The counterculture and anti-war movements were increasingly at odds with the Democratic Party, which, under President Johnson, steadily expanded the war despite the setbacks and protests. While it was clear that the party establishment would pick Johnson’s Vice President Hubert Humphrey as the Democratic Party’s candidate for the 1968 Presidential election, the activists planned to go to Chicago and disrupt the National Convention. Humphrey was largely seen as a representative of the war lobby. Different groups were involved in the protests. The Youth International Party of Hoffman, Students for a Democratic Society of Tom Hayden, and the Panthers were among them.

The protesters assembled in Chicago. But before they could march to the convention, Chicago Police and Illinois Guardsman broke them up using brute force. Humphrehy won the Democratic nomination, with blessings from the party bosses, but lost to Richard Nixon in the November election, who ran his campaign, in a year marked by protests and violence, over the theme of ‘law and order”, something which President Donald Trump is trying to do in 2020, another year that saw widespread race-related protests across America, after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in October.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/t56ysm/article32918943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-AARONSORKIN-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-political-context-of-the-trial-of-the-chicago-7/article32918936.ece
186,2020/10/22,‘General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait’ is a film that shows the devil in every authoritarian leader,"The 1974 documentary was filmed with the Ugandan dictator’s co-operation, but he wasn’t happy when he heard that a version he hadn’t seen was being shown in Europe

Many films have been made on the infamous Ugandan military dictator, General Idi Amin Dada; both fiction and non-fiction, including the Oscar-winning The Last King of Scotland. But the most intriguing of all is the very first one, an 87-minute-long documentary titled General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait, by the celebrated Swiss filmmaker Barbet Schroeder. Schroeder made this unique film in 1974 with Amin’s consent, and hence called it “a self-portrait”. Interestingly, Amin is also credited for the music in the film.

The prelude to the film is a brief history of Amin coming to power in a coup d’état; his proclamation of economic war by ordering the expulsion of Asians from Uganda in 1972; the mass murders conducted in full public view to set an example to dissenters; the announcement of his arrival to world leaders, from U.S. President Richard Nixon to Queen Elizabeth II, with hilarious but stupid telegrams —Amin ordered the Queen to send Scottish guards to accompany him to the Commonwealth Games. By 1974, the economic situation had deteriorated considerably, with increased unemployment and high levels of inflation.

At the surface level, the film’s structure is very straightforward: Schroeder and his crew capture Amin going about being the ‘President’ and this footage is interspersed with a voiceover — presumably Schroeder’s — providing important additional information. But the prototype of a dictator is revealed emphatically as we watch Amin make his speeches, showcase his love for animals — he takes the film crew on a boat ride, proudly asking them to film the elephants and crocodiles — mix freely with his people in public gatherings and talk irresponsibly about war and international affairs..

Simple solutions

It’s fascinating to see Amin’s simplistic view of problems. In a speech to boxers, he tells them the way to win is to knock out the opponent; to pilots, he says, don’t fly thinking of coming back to the base; he urges his cabinet ministers not to waste time with law and to use shortcuts to deliver justice — and, most importantly, to “teach people to love their leader”. In possibly the most tense sequence in the film, Amin is seen addressing a room full of doctors, giving a brief pep-talk in which he praises their role in maintaining public health and urges them not to drink “because people won’t believe a drunk doctor”. Then, a presumably brave doctor stands up and asks Amin to consult with the leader of the medical association to understand their challenges. The camera focuses on Amin’s face as the smile turns into a menacing frown.

As per Schroeder, many of the public events featured in the documentary were planned and staged specifically for the filming. Amin uses the opportunity to showcase his armed forces by taking the crew to several military training sessions and proudly showing off his tanks, guns and aircraft. But the visuals reveal their inadequate capabilities. In one amusing sequence, Amin makes the crew film a drill designed specifically to demonstrate how his military would conquer the Golan Heights (a region of conflict between Israel and Syria), ordering the camera to film a particular helicopter. In hindsight, the film would prove prophetic; in one sequence, Amin reveals in a sit-down interview that he would welcome Palestinian militants if they were to fly a hijacked Israeli plane to Uganda. This became a reality in 1976 when an Air France plane from Tel Aviv was hijacked and taken to Entebbe.

Screenshot from the documentary.

Evil and naïveté

Despite all the evil on display, it is hard not to notice the ease with which Amin could mingle with his people — there are sequences of him dancing with performers, playing the accordion with a band — and enthrall them with his seemingly popular humour-laced speeches. Like all authoritarian leaders, Amin also believed that he was the chosen one who would lead Uganda to prosperity; he was the most powerful and influential world leader; he worked hard to rise from a poor family to become the saviour. Occasionally, he also comes across as an endearing figure, with his infectious laughter when asked questions such as, “Is it true that you wrote to the Tanzanian Prime Minister that you would have married him if he was a woman,” and with his childlike enthusiasm to show his score at a shooting range. But it is hard to discern if he seriously meant to help when he says he set up a “Save Britain” fund to save the U.K. from financial ruin in 1973, and even harder to predict what would have happened if he had lost in the staged swimming race.

It was probably Amin’s naïveté that convinced him that such a film would help his cause. Schroeder played by Amin’s rules and yet managed to make a clever film with a very small crew and limited resources that would act as a reminder of the devil within every authoritarian leader. But it wasn’t a smooth ride for Schroeder; after realising that a longer version of the film — which he had not seen — was being shown everywhere in Europe, Amin ordered Schroeder to make some cuts. When Schroeder refused to comply, Amin arrested more than 100 French citizens in Uganda, put them in a hotel in Kampala, and asked them to call the director and convince him to make the cuts. Schroeder called this “censor by hostage”. Of course, after Amin lost power and fled to Libya in exile, Schroeder promptly put the deleted parts back into the film. The complete version of this timeless film is currently streaming on MUBI in India.

188,2020/10/22,A remake that is original: PC Sreeram retrospect on 25 years of ‘Kuruthipunal’,"On the film’s 25th anniversary, cinematographer-filmmaker PC Sreeram discusses the events that led to the making of the Kamal Haasan-starrer, and why its underlying emotion is more relevant today

They are cut from the same cloth, driven by their own ideologies. One comes from a position of privilege and is with the State, while the other is a messiah to the oppressed and tries to destabilise the establishment. They are both armed, but what sets them apart is that while one is bound by the conventions of law and order, the other is not.

Kamal Haasan’s DCP Adhi Narayanan and Nassar’s Badri, leader of a militant outfit, gave an edge to the PC Sreeram-directed Kuruthipunal, making its proceedings rather unusual and contemplative than what could have been a regular cat-and-mouse game.

There is a general anger against the system at fault that creeps into the narrative. Sreeram agrees that the anger and resultant feeling of being dwarfed by the system were what attracted him towards remaking Kuruthipunal. “In that sense, it is a very personal film. If you look at the photographs we had used in the first scene, we were angry with what had happened in the country,” says Sreeram over phone, “The anger in me was a reflection of my shots; the camera was always in close proximity with the subject. I don’t have a theory behind it, but this was the way I wanted to tell the story.”

How it all came together

Kamal and Sreeram were in Bombay when veteran filmmaker Govind Nihalani invited them for the screening of Drohkaal, starring the legendary duo Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah. This was a time when films were projected for distributors, friends and members of the fraternity. The film evoked an emotion in Sreeram, which he could not express then and even now. Kamal’s immediate response was to remake Drohkaal in Tamil and asked Sreeram what he thought. “That’s the best thing to do,” he said on a whim.

There were discussions among Sreeram, screenwriter John Edathattil (who wrote the screenplay for Gunaa) and Kamal on how to go about the shoot, and it was decided that the latter write the screenplay and dialogues. When the script was ready, Kamal had suggested three titles — one of which was Kuruthipunal and the other was Drohi, which eventually became the title for the Telugu version. The filmmaker was advised against going with Kuruthipunal (River of Blood) as the audience may not have a stomach for a morbid title. “But I was persistent because it was taken from a novel by [Indira] Parthasarathy and there was also a [Akira] Kurosawa connect [Throne of Blood],” he says.

One of the aspects that is less spoken about is the background score by Mahesh Mahadevan; it had no songs and very little background score, and was among the first Indian films to have a Dolby sound system. “The effect it [Dolby] produced gave a different dimension. In fact, most people came to theatres to experience the sound,” says Sreeram. It was Mahesh’s idea to synchronise the ominous score for Nassar. “He wanted the omen of death to reflect on Nassar’s face whenever he appeared. Sangu udhara maari irukanum (it should sound like a conch) is what he told me and it was his interpretation of the brief.”

Commercial viability was still a question of concern, given the absence of songs and the nature of the film (it was rated ‘A’). But Sreeram says they pulled it off in under 30 days with a tight budget and a tighter schedule — “The shooting was akin to a war footing. You cannot shoot three or four scenes a day, if not for a great star cast.”

Behind the lens

Sreeram does not see himself as a cinematographer but a co-author executing the vision of the author (director). However, in the case of Kuruthipunal, he was both author and co-author. He says the process was not as exhilarating as he thought it would be, “I am not a cinematographer but someone who is part of the expedition group,” he explains, adding, “There were lots that were planned ahead of the shoot, which made it easier for us. That is why this film gave me the most satisfaction.”

The film follows the pursuit of two level-headed cops Adhi Narayanan and Abbas (Arjun) on a covert mission called Operation Dhanush, to infiltrate a militant group. Through the course of their mission, they are awakened to a system that cracks from the inside and realise the price that they pay for: honesty.

Often cited as a cop film with western sensibilities, Kuruthipunal set a benchmark with regard to staging. A particular scene which has become a recurring motif in cop films, more recently in Vikram Vedha, is the interrogation featuring Kamal and Nassar. “Firstly, that is not how actual interrogation would look like,” he says, “I was opting for that visual style for the first time. I felt it shouldn’t look mundane; it also came from a point of commercial interest.”

Barring its artistic frames and performances, the film was replete with scenes that were violent and graphic, and depicted the extent of custodial torture. “When the threatening comes from the system of power, it will be brutal” says Sreeram, adding, “The idea was to convey the fear that seeps into a man [Adhi] who had always been true to his virtue. That fear of being let down by the system is more relevant now.”

He praises Kamal Haasan for treading a fine line between displaying desperation and betrayal, which were the film’s underlying themes. “Kamal sir conveys the feeling of helplessness remarkably well when he discovers that his boss [played by K Vishwanath], the one he looks up to, was a sellout,” says Sreeram, of a friendship that dates back a few decades preceding Kuruthipunal.

Camera buffs

Both Kamal and Sreeram were part of the now-famous “Samco” gang — comprising a motley group of film students and enthusiasts — that would gather at Samco hotel in Alwarpet in the ‘80s, spending the evening discussing world cinema over tea.

“It was also the cheapest place to get together because we had the luxury of sharing one tea amongst the five of us,” he says with a laugh, “We were just passionate about films. I was a film student then and my greatest skill was listening.”

Kuruthipunal, in fact, was among the last projects Sreeram and Kamal worked on after Nayakan, Apoorva Sagodharargal, Thevar Magan and Subha Sankalpam. When the film released a year after its Hindi counterpart in 1995, the response it got was overwhelming; the Tamil version fared much better compared to Telugu, according to Sreeram.

It was ultimately chosen as India’s entry for the Oscars that year, but was not nominated. “For me, it [Oscars] was not a big deal. Although you could say that Kuruthipunal had the intensity of a Hollywood film,” he adds.

The bigger deal, for Sreeram, was when Govind Nihalani came for the première and called it “a remake that is original”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/yav5ov/article32917388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pc-sreeram-on-25-years-of-kuruthipunal/article32917391.ece
189,2020/10/22,‘Lovecraft Country’ review: A gateway to all sorts of horrors,"The series, whose producers include Jordon Peele and JJ Abrams, uses pulp fiction to explore deeper questions of race, gender and sexuality

From the opening shots of aliens, spaceships and monsters from the fertile imagination of Korean War veteran Atticus Freeman (Jonathan Majors), Lovecraft Country fixes you with its glittering eye. It is the 1950s and Atticus, a black man, returns home to a mysterious letter from his abusive father Montrose (Michael K. Williams), who is missing.

Montrose has apparently gone to Ardham, Massachusetts to find details about Atticus’ mother’s family. Atticus, his friend Letitia (Jurnee Smollett) and his uncle George (Courtney B. Vance) set off on a road trip in Woody, the trusted family car to find Montrose and the family legacy. The road trip becomes a gateway to all sorts of horrors from slimy, many-toothed monsters to restless, vengeful spirits. There is also the horror of systemic racism from slavery and segregation to casual murders, lynching and unspeakable experiments on black people.

Lovecraft Country, whose producers include Jordon Peele (Get Out, Us) and JJ Abrams, uses pulp fiction to explore deeper questions of race, gender and sexuality. Though accused of perpetuating stereotypes, the gloriously gory Lovecraft Country, is a thoroughly entertaining ride through brightly coloured genres of pulp fiction from sci-fi to horror.

The American writer HP Lovecraft (1890-1937) is considered the father of modern horror and was also deeply racist. Lovecraft Country based on Matt Ruff’s eponymous book, takes Lovecraftian horrors and upends them by making black people the centre of the stories.

Lovecraft Country Season: 1

Episodes: 10

Run time: 53 to 68 minutes

Developed by: Misha Green

Starring: Jurnee Smollett, Jonathan Majors, Aunjanue Ellis, Courtney B. Vance, Wunmi Mosaku, Abbey Lee, Jamie Chung, Jada Harris, Michael K. Williams

Storyline: Atticus, a black Korean War veteran, battles Lovecraftian horrors in 1950s America

While Atticus discovers his legacy and connection with a secret society of wizards called the sons of Adam, his aunt, Hippolyta (Aunjanue Ellis), George’s wife, goes on a trip of her own through a multiverse where she can call herself anything and be anyone.

Letitia buys a house (unfortunately haunted by sinister Dr Hiram Ipstien’s horrific experiments) in the hope of creating a safe refuge for black people in need. Her half-sister, Ruby (Wunmi Mosaku) is seduced by a white man, William (Jordan Patrick Smith), who promises her a potion that will turn her into a white woman. While Ruby enjoys the power of being white, she realises it only makes her angrier. There is also Christina Braithwhite (Abbey Lee), the only white woman in the Sons of Adam, who chafes against being kept out of the order.

Diana (Jada Harris), Hippolyta and George’s daughter, draws sci-fi comics and when she is haunted by malevolent spirits, Topsy and Bopsy, it is up to the family to get rid of the spell. Ji-Ah (Jamie Chung) a Korean nurse who has a relationship with Atticus also has a secret. Abused by her stepfather, she is possessed by the Kumiho, a nine-tailed spirit. She has to kill 100 men before she can become human again. After killing 99, she meets and falls in love with Atticus but when Atticus sees her Kumiho form (it is truly hideous with tentacle-like tails coming out of all orifices) when they are having sex, he leaves her.

Using real events like the death of Emmett Till (who is presented as Diana’s friend) and the riots at Tulsa in 1921 as a backdrop does not work too well as it does not add to the narrative. However, the rich colours, the velvet music, the competent cast and the orgy of violence and monsters make Lovecraft Country an addictive watch.

192,2020/10/22,‘Borat’ sequel: Rudy Giuliani shown in hotel bedroom scene,"The former New York City mayor is shown in a compromising position in a hotel room with a young woman acting as a television journalist in a scene

Rudy Giuliani is shown in a compromising position in a hotel room with a young woman acting as a television journalist in a scene in Sacha Baron Cohen’s latest mockumentary, a sequel to his hit “Borat” film.

The scene shot in a New York hotel room in July —which resulted in Giuliani calling police — includes a moment when Giuliani is seen lying on a bed, tucking in his shirt with his hand down his pants and the young woman nearby.

Giuliani went to the hotel room thinking he was being interviewed about the Trump administration’s COVID-19 response. The young woman is flirtatious with him and invites him to the bedroom, which is rigged with hidden cameras.

Giuliani then asks for her phone number and address. He lies back on the bed to tuck in his shirt after she helps remove his recording equipment, and he has his hands in his pants when Baron Cohen rushes in wearing an outlandish outfit.

Baron Cohen, who was disguised as part of the crew, screams that the young woman is 15 years old. Up to that point, there is no indication she is underage. The character, who is Borat’s daughter, is played by Maria Bakalova, who is listed as 24 years old on the Internet Movie Database site, IMDb.com.

Speaking on his weekly radio program on WABC on Wednesday afternoon, Giuliani called the scene “a hit job.”

“I am tucking my shirt in, I assure you, that’s all that I was doing,” he said. He said he realized he was being set up when the woman asked whether he wanted a massage.

“At no time before, during, or after the interview was I ever inappropriate,” Giuliani tweeted. “If Sacha Baron Cohen implies otherwise, he is a stone-cold liar.”

The former New York City mayor called police after that encounter, but there is no indication an investigation was launched. Giuliani spoke to the New York Post’s Page Six column about the encounter in July but did not mention the bedroom aspect.

New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, who profiled Baron Cohen ahead of the the film’s release, tweeted Wednesday about the scene, “It’s even wilder than it sounds. Beyond cringe.”

Trolling those close to President Donald Trump is a central theme of the new “Borat” film, a sequel to the 2006 mockumentary that saw Baron Cohen’s character travel the United States, espousing sexist, racist and anti-Semitic views and eliciting similar responses from unwitting subjects.

For “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm - Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,” Baron Cohen returns as his alter ego from Kazakhstan in a plot that involves trying to give his daughter as a gift to Vice President Mike Pence.

The closest Borat gets is the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he shouts to Pence that he’s brought a woman for him. Dressed in a Donald Trump costume and with Borat’s daughter, played by Bakalova, slung over his shoulder, Baron Cohen is swiftly escorted out by security.

That leads to a second scheme involving Giuliani that ends up in the hotel room scene.

Giuliani finalized his divorce from his wife of 15 years in December.

Baron Cohen has made a history of poking fun at conservative figures. For his 2018 Showtime series “Who Is America,” the British comedian got former Vice President Dick Cheney to sign a waterboarding kit. A sketch with former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore involved the comedian administering a “pedophile test.” Moore has sued over the encounter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/u77xn1/article32915805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILM-BORAT2-RUDYGIULIANI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/borat-sequel-rudy-giuliani-shown-in-hotel-bedroom-scene/article32915806.ece

195,2020/10/22,"Promotion is administrative prerogative, says HC","‘Punishment of censure should have effect for one year’

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has dismissed the plea of a now retired government official who had sought a direction to be promoted to the post of District Revenue Officer with consequential benefits.

The court was hearing the petition filed in 2015 by D. Ravindran. The grievance of the petitioner was that he was entitled to be included in the panel of Assistant Commissioners fit for promotion to the post of District Revenue Officer.

His name was not included in the list on account of two sets of charges against him. The petitioner said that subsequently the charges were dropped and, therefore, he should have been included in the list. He was entitled to be promoted retrospectively, he said.

Justice S.M. Subramaniam observed that any punishment, including censure imposed on a member of service after the crucial date for consideration of promotion but before actual promotion or appointment, should be held against the member of service and he should not be given promotion or appointment.

The punishment of censure should have the effect for the period of one year. Therefore, within one year from the date of imposition of the punishment of censure, the officer was not entitled for promotion to the higher post, the judge said.

Promotion was an administrative prerogative, and per se could not be claimed as a matter of right, the judge said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/promotion-is-administrative-prerogative-says-hc-madurai/article32921194.ece
196,2020/10/22,‘Stop installation of high lamp masts in narrow street’,"Rockfort Welfare Association, Tiruchi, has filed a petition before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a direction to restrain Tiruchi Corporation from installing high masts carrying LED lamps in North Rockfort Street, Malaikottai, under the Smart City Mission.

The petitioner, R. Sundararajan, secretary of the association, said Rockfort was one of the heritage sites in Tiruchi identified for beautification. As part of the project, high lamp masts were proposed to be installed for illuminating the hillock.

North Rockfort Street was one of the spots where high masts would be installed. This would cause a lot of hardship to residents as the street was narrow. Installation of the high masts would further shrink the road and make it unmotorable, particularly for emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire engines, the petitioner said.

Also, during temple festivals temple car would not be able to enter the street, the petitioner said, and sought a direction to restrain the Corporation from installing the high masts in the narrow street.

197,2020/10/22,Coronavirus | All in Tamil Nadu will get COVID-19 vaccine free: Edappadi Palaniswami,"The Chief Minister said the spread of the novel coronavirus was on the decline in the State due to the intensive measures taken by the State government.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Thursday that the COVID-19 vaccine would be administered to all people in Tamil Nadu at government expense.

“People are apprehensive of contracting the novel coronavirus. When a vaccine is available, it will be administered to all free of cost,” he told reporters here after chairing a meeting to review the measures taken to control COVID-19 in the district.

Mr. Palaniswami, however, said the spread of the novel coronavirus was on the decline in the State, owing to intense measures taken by the government. Compared to the neighbouring Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the spread of the infection had been brought down in Tamil Nadu.

“The coordinated efforts have yielded good results at a time when even developed countries are finding it difficult to control the spread of the virus,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

The number of positive cases had come down, while the number of those who recovered from the infection had increased. These measures had also helped to bring down the mortality rate, he said.

Complimenting officials on their dedication in the fight against the infection, at the frontline, Mr. Palaniswami said adequate testing centres had been created all over the State and bed facilities had been augmented at hospitals. Tamil Nadu was on top in respect of testing: RT-PCR tests were being done on 90,000 persons a day.

Mr. Palaniswami accused Leader of the Opposition and DMK president M.K. Stalin of spreading false information in a “planned manner” about the investments made in the State after the global investors meet.

The establishment of the manufacturing unit of ITC Ltd., at Viralimalai in the backward Pudukottai district, providing employment to 2,200 persons, was an example of the government’s commitment to attracting investments and promoting industrialisation, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/6crmey/article32918884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PALANISWAMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-vaccine-will-be-provided-free-in-tamil-nadu-says-cm-palaniswami/article32918885.ece
198,2020/10/22,Empowering girls in a fishing hamlet through Kabbadi,"For the past three years, a school physical training (PT) master has been trying to secure a good future for girls from fishing hamlets in Mamallapuram with the help of Kabbadi. Though he provides free coaching for them, he is forced to seek donations from others to provide jerseys and shoes for the team members. Now the district police have come forward to help his team.

G. Satish Kumar, the 32-year-old PT master at Swami Dayananda Matriculation School has been conducting free kabbadi coaching for the girls in Koovathur fishing hamlet. “Most of the families here are poor and some of them get their girl children married at an early age due to poverty. I wanted to stop this. Hence I went and spoke to the parents and convinced them that the sport can fetch their children collegiate education and a good job. Many of them agreed and started sending their children for coaching despite their hardship,” he explained.

He formed a sports club and is now coaching 15 girls who are studying in class eighth. “It takes three years to develop a good team. They have won district and divisional tournaments and took part in state-level school kabaddi tournaments. But the team does not have proper jerseys or shoes and I struggle to take them for tournaments in other districts. Most of the children are from poor families so even they are not able to fend for their travel expenses,” he said.

Police comes to rescue

The team is supposed to participate in a tournament in Tiruvannamalai on Friday and Mr. Satish Kumar was wondering how to travel to the district with his team mates, when help arrived from the police. “I heard about the team and I requested a NGO called Directions Charitable Trust, to sponsor them. We will try to help them in whichever way possible. Involving the girls in sports and making them excel in it will help prevent child marriages too. We will organise other skill development programmes,” said E Sundaravathanan, ASP, Mamallapuram sub-division.

Arjunan Isaiarasu from Directions Charitable Trust said that his organisation was happy to help the team. “We will continue to support them,” he said.

M. Nathiya, mother ōf M. Narmada who is part of the Kabbadi team, said that she wanted her daughter to excel in sports and get a good job. “Seeing her, other residents in our hamlet are inspired and send their daughters for coaching. We will not get her married at a young age, we want her to pursue higher studies.

199,2020/10/22,"Eligibility of TET certificates: Validity extension should be given for everyone, say teachers","In 2013, over 70,000 teachers passed the TNTET and several thousands of teachers are yet to receive jobs.

Teachers' associations have welcomed a move by the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE) to grant lifetime validity of the Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) certificate for candidates in the future. However, they have also appealed for extending similar validity to teachers who have already cleared the exam.

The council had approved the extension of the validity in their general body meeting held in September and said that the provision to extend the validity of the certificate from seven years to a lifetime will have ‘prospective effect’.

“For those who have already passed out and already have TET certificates, NCTE would take legal opinion and act accordingly,” the council said.

The Tamil Nadu Teachers Association welcomed this move and said that while it would greatly benefit teachers and steps should be taken to extend this provision to teachers who have already passed the exam as well.

“Teachers are losing their livelihood due to lack of work and the certificate expiring after 7 years would bring us additional concerns. We urge the council to consider the plight of teachers across the country who already have certificates and extend the validity as well,” said P.K. Ilamaran, president, Tamil Nadu Teachers Association.

In 2013, over 70,000 teachers passed the TNTET and several thousands of teachers are yet to receive jobs. “Keeping this in mind, we are appealing to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to extend the validity of all these teachers,” said M.Elangovan, coordinator, 2013 TNTET qualified teachers welfare association.

In 2018, the Tamil Nadu government had also announced that apart from TNTET, teachers would also have to qualify in a competitive exam to become eligible for jobs. “Instead of implementing this additional exam, we want hiring to be done on the basis of TET seniority- for instance, teachers who cleared TET back in 2013 and are still without jobs can be given first preferences for vacancies,” Mr. Elangovan added.

University informs students

The Tamil Nadu Teachers Education University, in a circular, informed all its affiliated colleges of the recent announcement to extend the validity of the TET certificate. V. Balakrishnan, registrar of the university, asked colleges to encourage students pursuing their B.Ed and M.Ed degrees to take up the TET and benefit from the same.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/eligibility-of-tet-certificates-validity-extension-should-be-given-for-everyone-say-teachers/article32918142.ece
200,2020/10/22,Bonded labourers rescued from Tiruttani,"Some of the women workers also alleged sexual harassment by the owner.

A total of 7 bonded labourers, including three childten, were rescued from a wood cutting unit in Kodivalli village near Kanagamachathiram in Tiruttani on Thursday by Tirutanni Revenue officials and police.

Ten others who were working in the unit were also rescued during the operation. It is alleged that the owner had also sexually abused some of the women workers and made all of them work during the lockdown.

According to Tiruttani revenue, officials, staff of the International Justice Mission received information about bonded labourers present in a woodcutting unit run by Ramesh of Arakkonam in Kodivalli village and it was conveyed to M. Sathya, Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO), Tiruttani. She and a team of policemen raided the unit.

""There were a total of 17 of them including six children. When we inquired, they said that only seven from Ramapuram village in Tiruttani were bonded labourers as they had taken an advance of ₹20,000 from the owner. This included three child labourers. The other 10 claimed that they were rescued by Ranipet RDO in 2014 and given release certificates. Now they have been working for daily wages,"" said Ms. Sathya.

The seven bonded labourers reportedly told the officials that they left the unit some time ago due to the torture meted out against them, but the owner came to their village and brought them back to the Unit. “Many children wanted to study, but Ramesh verbally abused them and even passed casteist remarks. They claim they were forcibly taken back to the unit”, she added.

Some of the women workers also alleged sexual harassment by the owner. “He used to pay them ₹500 every three weeks. This is sheer torture and they were struggling for food,: added Ms. Sathya. She said that apart from cases under Bonded Labour System Abolition Act, Ramesh will be booked for sexual harassment, child labour and even under Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

202,2020/10/22,PMK founder Ramadoss hits out at Tamil Nadu government,"Ramadoss urged the Vanniyar community to prepare themselves for a massive protest demanding separate reservation.

In a sharp attack on the government in Tamil Nadu, S Ramadoss, founder of PMK, a key ally of the ruling AIADMK, on Thursday accused it of not heeding to people's demands. On the other hand, he praised Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy saying the latter is fullfilling all his promises and also going beyond it in delivering welfare measures to the public.

While commending Mr Reddy in a tweet, the PMK leader, who aligned with the AIADMK ahead of last year's Lok Sabha polls, criticised the Tamil Nadu Government. He said those ruling here now are refusing to say anything about fulfilling the requests of public and even if it is pointed out to them, they are not bothered and do not fulfil them.

However, he did not specify which demands of the people were not fulfilled by the government.

Earlier in the day, Mr Ramadoss urged the Vanniyar community to prepare themselves for a massive protest demanding separate reservation.

In a social media post, he pointed out the demand for 20% reservation for Vanniyars is a long pending demand for over 40 years and already lot of protests and sacrifices have been made.

However, Mr. Ramadoss said those who ruled the state in the past and the current government have not fulfilled the demand.

“Time has come to again fight for our rights and this protest would be a historic one. It will make the government to request us to stop the protest and accede to our demand,” he said.

AIADMK sees attack on govt as posturing by PMK

The ruling AIADMK felt Dr. Ramadoss was resorting to posturing, ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections, by attacking the state government.

A senior AIADMK minister, preferring anonymity, said the PMK founder’s posturing was actually to improve the bargaining power of his party during the run-up the Assembly elections.

However, PMK sources said Dr Ramadoss was upset because the AIADMK government had not implemented a separate reservation for Vanniyars.

Asked would not his tweet cause strain in the relationship between the PMK and the AIADMK, sources said Dr Ramadoss was ready for any consequences as his objective was only to obtain separate reservation for Vanniyars. That was why he had given a call to the Vanniyar community to prepare themselves for a struggle to win 20 per cent reservation for them.

“Many youth who were not born when we launched the struggle for reservation wanted to participate in a similar struggle. Time has come to fulfil their wish,” he had said.

Reiterating that the struggle for a separate reservation would be historical event, Dr Ramadoss said the government would be forced to request the community to give up the struggle and invite to sign the agreement for reservation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/whv8f/article32916570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SRAMADOSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pmk-founder-ramadoss-hits-out-at-tamil-nadu-government/article32916571.ece
203,2020/10/22,PMK MP Anbumani Ramadoss urges Centre to withdraw 10% EWS quota,"10% quota for the economically weaker sections was given without any social survey or statistics, says the Rajya Sabha MP

Pattali Makka Katchi's Member of Parliament and youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss on Thursday urged the Centre to immediately withdraw the 10% quota for the economically weaker sections (EWS) among open competition category, contending that it is creating a big social injustice.

Also read: Majority of Tamil Nadu parties oppose 10% EWS quota

In a statement, he pointed out that in the recently released SBI Clerk preliminary exam result, the cut off for the OBC/SC/ST category was 59.50%, while for EWS it was only 57.75%.

Mr. Anbumani claimed that when he raised the issue last year, the Centre had unofficially said that the cut-off would be increased from this year.

If the argument is that this year also only lesser number of EWS candidates appeared for the exams, then it should be interpreted that they have been given higher quota, he added.

The opportunities meant for SC/ST and OBC candidates are going to the EWS candidates and this is dangerous and against principle of social justice, Mr. Anbumani argued.

Also read: It is up to States to provide 10% EWS quota: Centre

The EWS quota was given without any social survey or statistics and the current example is a clear proof of the social injustice rendered to SC/ST and OBC candidates, he added.

In a separate statement, PMK founder S. Ramadoss urged Tamil Nadu government to follow the example of Andhra Pradesh government, which has set up separate welfare board for 56 major castes under the Backward Classes category.

He pointed out there are 263 castes under the backward classes category and a separate welfare board should be formed for each category whose population is more than 30,000 and the person belonging to that category must be appointed as the head of the welfare board.

In a separate statement, Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) president K. Veeramani also pointed out the social injustice in SBI Clerk preliminary exam result and alleged that the EWS quota was brought in for welfare of the upper caste. He also said parties like Congress and CPM which voiced support to the EWS quota should reconsider it.

In a bid to boost fitness within the force, the Fire and Rescue Services Department has opened a gym in Villupuram to help firefighters attached to 14 fire stations in Villupuram and Kallakurichi districts remain physically fit for the task.

The gym was set up District Fire Officer of Villupuram district Robin Castro. A 2019 batch officer, Mr. Castro has introduced a schedule for all the 145 firefighters in Villupuram and Kallakurichi districts to sweat it out and remain physically and mentally fit.

207,2020/10/22,Chennai's real estate market shows signs of recovery,"After a slump during COVID-19, sales are seeing an uptick

Following relaxations in lockdown restrictions, the residential market in Chennai, which had witnessed a slump due to the pandemic, is now slowly showing signs of recovery. Real estate firms are even queuing up new launches.

Estimates provided by real estate firm Knight Frank show that city-based developers managed to sell over 3,085 new properties between July and September, when compared to 4,240 during the same period last year. The analysis done by Knight Frank pointed out that with developers innovating on marketing prowess to include financial benefits, discounts and easy payment options to attract buyers during the lockdown, sales have seen an uptick in the third quarter of 2020 over the preceding one.

‘Demand for housing’

“The lockdown resulted in a pent-up demand for housing. Homebuyers who were fence-sitting before COVID-19 are back in the market to take advantage of the reduction in interest rates on home loans and the availability of ready-to-move-in properties,” said Sanjay Chugh, city head (Chennai), ANAROCK Property Consultants.

“Residential properties [apartments/plotted land] priced at ₹25 lakh-₹75 lakh are witnessing maximum traction from homebuyers in suburban areas. The work-from-home option has changed preferences towards larger apartments in the suburbs. Homebuyers are willing to travel a little further to buy a larger home to accommodate a dedicated working space within their houses,” he added.

Padam Dugar, vice-chairman and managing director of Dugar Housing Limited and president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI)-Chennai chapter, said the post-pandemic home had become a necessity rather than an investment.

“Lower home-loan interest rates have helped sales in the city. It will get a better boost if the Tamil Nadu government comes out with some incentives by reducing the stamp duty,” said Prakash Challa, chairman and managing director of SSPDL.

Chennai’s residential real estate market also witnessed an increase in launches, from 182 units in the second quarter of 2020 to 1,487 in the third, according to data provided by JLL Research (the comparison pertains only to the last two quarters, since the current crisis has no parallel, and has infused uncertainty that has not been witnessed in the past decades).

The western suburbs (Porur, Ambattur and Padi) accounted for nearly 80% of the launches during the quarter. JLL’s data showed that residential real estate witnessed pent-up demand, translating into sales, and 1,570 units were sold during Q3 2020. Sales were concentrated in the southern (Padur, Navalur, Perumbakkam and Kilkattalai) and western suburbs, which contributed over 80% to the quarter.

Maximum sales traction was witnessed in the affordable and lower-mid segments. Subsequently, enquiries for larger-sized homes from a certain section of prospective buyers also increased, as preferences shifted towards homes with more open spaces and study rooms.

“There has been a marginal decline in unsold inventory during the quarter, as sales outpaced launches. While quoted residential prices remain stagnant, developers are offering various financial schemes, low booking amounts and other freebies to attract homebuyers,” said Siva Krishnan, managing director, Chennai, JLL India.

Two real estate developers said they had managed to sell properties after relaxations in lockdown norms, but consumers were on a bargaining spree. One of them said he had to dole out lucrative incentives to ensure that the consumer picked his space. “Enquires are coming in, and demand is picking up at a slow pace,” he added. Most developers said with work-from-home options, consumers now wanted better spaces of their own.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7bopp6/article32913019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-LT-HOUSESINCHENNAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/real-estate-market-shows-signs-of-recovery/article32913020.ece
208,2020/10/22,"Courts must presume people’s innocence, says Madras HC","Judge comes to aid of person holding Indian and Swiss passports

“It is legitimate for the police, given the kind of training imparted to them, to distrust and suspect everyone but courts must always start with a presumption that all persons are honest and innocent,” the Madras High Court has said.

Justice P.N. Prakash made the observation while quashing a First Information Report (FIR) booked against a 35-year-old clinical psychologist by the Greater Chennai police for having possessed both Indian and Swiss passports ever since he was a child.

The FIR had been booked in 2018 at the insistence of a Deputy Passport Officer who accused the petitioner of having made a false declaration in 2006, when the psychologist was a 19-year-old, that he did not possess citizenship of any other country.

However, on inquiry, the judge found that the petitioner had actually grown up in an orphanage in Chennai. According to his birth certificate, he was born on May 11, 1985. He was given in adoption to a childless couple in January 1986.

His adopted father was an Indian national and mother a Swiss national. He grew up with his father, a nationalised bank employee, who had obtained an Indian passport for him when he was less than 10-months-old and continued to renew it periodically.

Simultaneously, his mother had obtained a Swiss passport for him when he was a four-year-old and she, too, continued to renew it periodically. The petitioner had never used his Swiss passport to travel to any country during his childhood and even after.

As a 19-year-old in 2006, he got his Indian passport renewed after giving an undertaking that he did not hold any foreign citizenship. He was reportedly not aware of the Swiss passport, he claimed, and Justice Prakash found no reason to disbelieve him. The judge pointed out that the entire issue of dual passports came to light only when the petitioner voluntarily wanted to surrender his Indian passport in 2016 in order to obtain an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card. It was only after that a police complaint was lodged against him.

Holding that the petitioner did not appear to have committed any offence, the judge said the question of prosecution would not have arisen if he had gone to Switzerland with his Swiss passport and surrendered his expired Indian passport at the Embassy there.

The judge also stated that the Central Crime Branch police here could not be blamed for having registered an FIR because providing wrong information in a passport application would amount to an offence under the Passports Act of 1967.

“However, technicalities cannot put shackles in the hands of constitutional courts which do have the power to come to the rescue of an honest person in a given case as the present one,” the judge concluded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5m2i2b/article32903952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MADRASHIGHCOURTVG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/courts-must-presume-peoples-innocence-says-madras-hc/article32912978.ece

211,2020/10/22,Diabetics in low income countries at higher risk of mortality: study,"‘Cardiovascular event rates 3 times higher in diabetics’

Lack of access to medication could be a reason for a higher risk of mortality in low income countries, an international study has found.

The study, which looked at population across 21 countries, found that the risk of death due to diabetes is higher in low income countries than in high income countries. It compared people with diabetes and those without diabetes, in low, middle and high income countries and found that the overall mortality rate is three times higher among those with diabetes as compared to those without diabetes.

The rate doubles when the risk of mortality among persons with diabetes in a low income country is compared to persons without diabetes in high income countries. “Primarily rates of cardiovascular events like heart attack are about three times higher in those with diabetes across all countries,” explains Anjana Ranjit Mohan, lead author and vice-president of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation. “The overall mortality is higher in low income countries. In the lower income countries, the background mortality is higher among those with diabetes and non-diabetes. The mortality rate among those with diabetes is manifold higher here when compared to those in higher income countries,” she says.

The study, Contrasting Associations Between Diabetes and Cardiovascular Mortality Rates in Low-, Middle-, and High-Income Countries: Cohort Study Data From 143,567 Individuals in 21 Countries in the PURE Study (Anjana et al), was published in the journal Diabetes Care.

The researchers looked at the access to healthcare and medication across the countries. Dr. Anjana says, “We looked at the categories of anti-diabetes drugs, anti-hypertensives, statins and aspirins. In high income countries, about 60% of people are taking their medication correctly but only 20% in low income countries take their medication. This could be one of the reasons that the event rate is higher and the death rate is higher.”

The researchers also felt individuals in low income countries were not prescribed drugs at optimal dose or at optimal time, which they termed “therapeutic inertia”.

Access to finance

This non-availability of medicines could be related to access to finance, as in low income countries most patients pay out of pocket for medicines. It could also be due to patient or providers’ belief regarding the safety and efficacy of the medicines prescribed.

The researchers said individuals with self-reported diabetes had “higher hazards of mortality” when compared to those with newly diagnosed diabetes. They made a case for more widespread screening of the population so that risk factors are identified early and treated appropriately.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/vzqd5y/article29975037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DIABETES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/diabetics-in-low-income-countries-at-higher-risk-of-mortality-study/article32912877.ece
212,2020/10/22,Hike in onion prices due to hoarding: Stalin,"DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday alleged that hoarding had resulted in the hike in onion prices.

In a statement in Chennai, he said even if the AIADMK government procured onion and sold it for cheaper rates in the open market, it was not clear whether it would be available to all.

“The price of onion has increased to ₹130 per kg and it will increase manifold as the newly-enacted farm laws will allow hoarding,” the DMK leader charged.

On war-footing

Mr. Stalin said at least now the AIADMK government should realise the situation and not allow the implementation of the farm laws in Tamil Nadu.

“The government should take steps on a war-footing and procure onion for sale in the open market,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hike-in-onion-prices-due-to-hoarding-stalin/article32912845.ece

Korea and India can closely co-operate to create a new digital framework in the MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) industry by combining their strengths, Young-seup Kwon, Consul-General of the Republic of Korea in Chennai, has said.

“I don’t think that non-personal MICE can totally replace the face-to-face MICE industry. So it is highly likely that the hybrid on-line and off-line MICE will become the future standard,” he said in his inaugural address at the webinar on ‘Future of MICE Travel Post COVID’, with a focus on South Korea, organised by Korea Tourism and The Hindu.

Korea and India could closely cooperate to create a new digital framework in the MICE industry by combining Korea’s strengths in the hardware and product research and development with India’s strengths in the software and IT solutions, Mr. Kwon said. This kind of synergy effects had already been proved in the Samsung R&D centre and LG Software in Bengaluru, and it should be extended to other areas and companies, he said.

Mr. Kwon also noted that India would have more Korean investments and become the regional and global manufacturing hub for the Korean companies, in line with India’s ‘Make in India and Make for the World’ policy.

Suresh Chukkapalli, Honorary Consul-General of the Republic of Korea, Telangana, and Chairman Emeritus, Phoenix Group, said India and Korea had many things in common in terms of culture and Korea was one of the safest countries and of late, filmmakers were encouraged to go and shoot in Korea.

Sandeep Dutta, Marketing Manager, Korea Tourism Organization, said Korea had a world-class infrastructure and one of the fastest internet connections.

An encouragement

At a panel discussion, Aikta Tyagi, vice-president, Special Events and Facilities, Amway India Enterprises, said the company used the MICE as a tool to incentivise its distributors. Ashok Jaiswar, Group Head, Marketing B2C and B2B, Greaves Cotton Limited, said MICE was used to motivate and encourage the company’s retail and front-line teams.

Shefali Khalsa, Head, Brand and Corporate Communication, SBI General Insurance, said the exhibitions component of the MICE had been worst affected by the lockdown to curb COVID-19.

Ramadoss on Wednesday welcomed the decision taken by the Centre to extend the validity of the certificate given by the National Council of Teacher Education to candidates who pass the Teachers Eligibility Test and the Central Teachers Eligibility Test for lifetime.

He urged the State government to create vacancies by considering the student and teacher ratio at the school level instead of at the State level and fill the positions with candidates still waiting for jobs.

In a statement, he said, “Validity of the certificate used to be seven years. When the tests were introduced, around 90% of the candidates who were certified got jobs. But since 2013, the vacancies were not filled properly and less number of appointments were made.”

“With the validity of the certificates expiring this year, this is a welcome move,” he said.

217,2020/10/22,"CRPF recruitment centres likely in T.N., Puducherry","‘Decision will be based on scrutiny of applications for paramedical staff’

The office of the Directorate-General, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), has said recruitment centres in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry for the written examination for paramedical staff recruitment would be designated, if required, on scrutiny of applications.

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan had sought at least one centre each in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry because out of the nine recruitment centres designated, there was none for the State and the Union Territory.

Responding to his memorandum, Manoj Dhyani, Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Recruitment), CRPF, said the designated recruitment centres had been selected region-wise on the basis of previous recruitments and anticipated receipt of applications. “Scrutiny of applications for the recruitment of paramedical staff-2020 is under way. After completion of the process, more recruitment centres may be designated, if required,” he said.

Welcoming the open-minded approach of the CRPF, Mr. Venkatesan expressed the hope that the centres would be set up in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. He said recruitment centres should be announced at the stage of submission of applications itself. Lack of centres would have discouraged many job aspirants from applying for the recruitment.

The CRPF should announce new centres and extend the last date for submission of applications, he said.

218,2020/10/22,Stalin urges Governor to give assent to medical quota bill,"Govt. school students can benefit from reservation this year itself, he says

DMK president M.K Stalin on Wednesday urged Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit to give assent to the Bill seeking to implement 7.5% horizontal reservation for NEET-qualified State government school students in medical college admissions.

In a letter to the Governor, he said the government school students could benefit from the reservation this academic year itself, only if the assent for 7.5% horizontal reservation Bill, passed by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, was given immediately.

He reiterated that the DMK had been demanding the scrapping of NEET, “which acts as a hindrance for rural and urban poor students to pursue their medical studies and to realise their dream of becoming doctors”.

Mr. Stalin pointed out that the Bill was adopted in the Assembly based on the recommendations of Justice Kalaiyarasan to provide the reservation to government school students who had scored qualifying marks in the NEET.

G.O. enough: VCK

Meanwhile, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder Thol. Thirumavalavan too urged the government to pass a G.O. instead of waiting for the Governor to sign off on the Bill.

In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan argued that a law needs to be passed only if ‘reservation is going to be introduced for a category’. “The state government is within its powers to make an allocation for sub-reservation within the pre-existing reservation. Not only that, no special legislation has to be passed in these circumstances, and it can be achieved through a Government Order alone,” he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan recalled how the DMK government in 1977 constituted a high-level committee to look into rural students’ representation in education, and following the recommendations of the committee, implemented 15% reservation for rural students in engineering and medical seats through a G.O. “The subsequent AIADMK government under the leadership of Selvi Jayalalithaa increased the rural students reservation to 25%. That was also done through a G.O.,” he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan said that though the orders were challenged, and subsequently struck down by the High Court of Madras, the court did not rule at any point that the State government does not have the power to issue G.Os.

“While striking down these orders, the court only held that the State failed to show cause that students from rural areas were at a disadvantaged position compared to their urban counterparts. It also held that the government failed to justify the discrimination,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stalin-urges-governor-to-give-assent-to-medical-quota-bill/article32912730.ece

Tokyo Olympics organisers wrapped up three days of tests on Wednesday, trialling a number of security and COVID-19 countermeasures and asking supporters and officials to pack less to wait less when entering venues during the Games.

During the tests at Tokyo Big Sight, a convention centre that will host the media during the postponed Games next year, organisers assessed various technologies to monitor body temperatures of spectators.

‘Thermometer strips’

As seen at other sporting events during the pandemic, thermology cameras and non-contact infrared thermometers were used but organisers also tested the use of ‘thermometer strips’.

The strips, which were pasted onto the wrists of volunteers being used in the trial, contain heat-sensitive liquid crystals and can immediately detect if the wearer has a fever. Another key element of the field test was checking how smoothly spectators can pass through the inspection area while other measures, such as social distancing in queues, are being enforced.

Volunteers presented security personnel with more than 40 different scenarios, including forgetting to wear a mask and trying to bring an aerosol can through security, to test their readiness for the Games.

Happy with initiative

Organisers were happy with the testing but said more trials will be needed when full COVID-19 protocols are decided. “Pack less, wait less.

The State government has informed the five-member inter-ministerial Central team, deputed to Telangana to assess the damaged caused by rains and floods, that the loss suffered by different sectors was over ₹9,420 crore with the agriculture sector bearing the maximum brunt.

Chief Secretary to the Government Somesh Kumar explained to the Central team, led by Joint Secretary in Home Ministry Praveen Vashista, on Thursday that the State government had taken all measures to minimise loss of life and property in the recent rains and floods. He also explained the extent of damage with the help of a photo exhibition on the damage caused.

Mr. Somesh Kumar stated that damage to public infrastructure was enormous and the State government had already made a preliminary assessment of the damage. While the loss to crops was estimated at ₹8,633 crore, the loss to road network was around ₹222 crore. Besides, loss in the GHMC area was estimated to be around ₹567 crore.

On its part the State government had released ₹550 crore for immediate flood relief and food packets were supplied to over 2 lakh people. Besides, each family in the affected/inundated areas was given one kg of bleaching powder and over 3 lakh chlorine tables were also distributed among the affected people. All the 15 electrical sub-stations which were inundated were brought back into service within 48 hours, Mr. Somesh Kumar explained to the visiting team.

The visiting team also interacted with the senior officials of Irrigation, Municipal Administration, Roads and Buildings, Energy, Agriculture and Panchayat Raj Departments, GHMC and Hyderabad Metro Water Board. The officials gave an overview of the loss incurred by the departments individually.

Officials explained to the Central team that there was excess rainfall during the last 10 days and it had resulted in flooding. Although rains across the State were excessive, the damage other than crop and roads was most in and around Hyderabad. Breaches to three major tanks coupled with flooding in Musi river resulted in inundation of several low lying areas in the City, they told the visiting team.

A Central team led by R.B. Kaul and K. Manoharan visited several villages in Mulugu and Murkook mandals on Thursday and examined the crop lost due to the recent heavy rains and floods. They also inspected the damaged roads and submerged houses.

Collector P. Venkatrami Reddy took the team to the villages and showed them the damaged crops. The team visited Timmapur village in Mulugu mandal and interacted with farmers. The farmers informed the officials that more than half the crop was lost at the time of harvest, further the crop was left to soak in rain water. The farmers told the team that they had been struggling with pest attack and have urged the government to come to their rescue.

Later, the team has visited Annasagar in Mulugu mandal where a culvert was washed away due to heavy flooding. The Collector informed the team that due to flooding all the fields were filled with sand and mud, and it would be a herculean task for farmers to make the fields cultivable again. Large number of farmers met the visiting Central team and poured out their woes to them. They said that cotton crop was lost at the time of first picking of balls itself.

The team members interacted with paddy farmers at Murkook and asked one Bomma Yellaiah how he lost the crop.

Mr. Venkatrami Reddy explained to the visiting officials that there was rain for 80 days out of 120 days, for the first time in the last three decades. “There was a rainfall of 1,449.5 mm against the normal rainfall of 760.2 mm. As much as 20 cm rain fall was registered within three days. Main crops like paddy, cotton and vegetables were lost. Crops were damaged in 84,159 acres worth ₹ 423.7 crore pertaining to 62,745 farmers. Further, 3,047 houses were damaged and three persons were killed during heavy rains,” the Collector explained. They were also informed that R&B roads were damaged to the extent of 324 km, which would require ₹ 17.54 crore for restoration, 71 km panchayat raj roads were damaged and require ₹ 18.17 crore for repair work.

The Central team is expected to submit its report to the Central government shortly. Secretary Agriculture Janardhan Reddy and others accompanied the team.

This came to light when Atmakur police of Kurnool district interrogated 21 ‘tricksters’, including a woman, who were arrested for trying to sell ‘naga sorakaya' (snake bottle gourd) to gullible people for a minimum of ₹10 lakh and a maximum of ₹30 lakh each.

Of 21 accused, four are from Kurnool and Anantapur, while the rest 17 are the native of Mahabubnagar, Nalgonda, Wanaparthy, Nagarkurnool and Jogulamba Gadwal districts in Telangana.

Matka is a chance game where a punter gets a return of ₹90 for every Re one bet. Online gambling is banned in both the Telugu States.

When the mobile phone of prime accused Gopidesi Venkata Subba Rao was examined, the investigators found a number of online matka apps, and further going through his WhatsApp messages they stumbled upon frequent chats between some sadhus and others in the temple town, said Atmakur Deputy Commissioner of Police J Venkata Rao.

He said Venkata Subba Rao was also a self-styled godman, who lives in Vishweshwaraiah Annapurna Devi Ashramam, run by one Aravinda Reddy, a history-sheeter with Atmakur police station.

“They send messages to fellow gamblers in a code language and the bet money is transferred online to the punters’ bank accounts,” Mr. Rao said.

The offers given by the organisers are very lucrative. A message from the WhatsApp chat of a 'swamiji' read: Matka play live with a highest full rate. Same day withdrawal. Bumper offer in a deposit of ₹2,000 and more five % extra point. ₹10,000 and more 10 % extra, ₹20,000 and more 15 % extra and more ₹50,000 and more 20 % extra. Minimum deposit is ₹200 and minimum withdrawal is ₹1,000.

“With the arrest of this gang, we came to know that online gambling is rampant and quite popular among sadhus here. Measures will be taken to curb the illicit activity,” the officer said.

Initially, the godmen invest in the game with the money they get through alms and after getting good returns, holed themselves up for a couple of days in neighbouring villages or some parts of Telangana, as smoking and drinking alcohol is banned in the temple town.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/self-styled-godmen-in-srisailam-hooked-to-online-matka/article32919946.ece

The team first visited the road over bridge damaged in the Chandrayangutta-Falaknuma area and the nearby localities inundated by flood. They interacted with the flood-affected people to have first-hand knowledge on the impact of flood and examined the restoration works there, including desiltation of nala.

Several residents of the area explained to the Central team that the flood water reached up to the first floor of houses after submerging the ground floor completely and the murky water and muck was still around even 10 days after flooding. Walls of their houses were damaged badly as they were soaked in water for over 10 days now.

Commissioner of GHMC D.S. Lokesh Kumar and Chief Engineer of GHMC Jiauddin informed the Central team that heavy flow of water in the seven-metre wide nala after the breach of Palle Cheruvu tank had damaged the retaining walls of the bridges badly and inundated several residential areas downstream with water flowing up to a height of five meters on the roads.

The Central team then examined the restoration works of nala near Kandikal gate and interacted with flood-affected people in Phoolbagh area in Chadrayangutta. Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi met the team and explained that flood water had flowed up to 10 ft height in the area causing heavy damage to property.

During the visit to Balapur and Hafeezbaba Nagar areas, flood-affected people explained to the Central team that furniture and other household belongings were completely damaged in the muck that covered their houses after the breach of Palle Cheruvu and Gurram Cheruvu tanks and the intensity of flood had also led to collapse of walls. Mr. Vashista of the Central team suggested to the GHMC officials to focus on strengthening the tanks as a permanent measure to prevent recurrence of flooding and inundation.

At Gurram Cheruvu and Palle Cheruvu tanks, the Central team examined temporary restoration works to plug the breaches. Before winding up their field visit the Central team examined the breach plugging work at Appa Cheruvu at Gaganpahad. GHMC officials explained to the team that the intensity of flood had washed away several two-wheelers and four-wheelers parked in the residential colonies in the area after the breach of Appa Cheruvu.

227,2020/10/22,"Telangana scribe’s minor son kidnapped for ransom, killed","Abductor was known to boy’s parents.

The kidnap for ransom of a nine-year-old boy, son of a journalist in Mahbubabad town- 220 km from here- ended in tragedy as the police found him murdered on Thursday.

The parents had arranged ₹45 lakh to be paid to the abductor for the safe return of the boy. The Mahbubabad district police, which launched 10 special teams to crack the abduction mystery reported four days ago, received a rude jolt as the boy’s burnt body was found just 5 km from his home.

A person known to the boy’s parents emerged the abductor and killer in the sensational case. Presenting the accused Manda Sagar before the media at Mahbubabad, district SP Koti Reddy said greed to make fast buck drove him to kidnap and kill the boy. The boy’s father Ranjith Reddy is a reporter for Telugu TV channel T News.

“Sagar, who is in his early 20s alone carried out the kidnap and killing. Possible complicity of others is still being probed,” the SP told The Hindu over phone. Deekshit was playing near his house on Thursday around 6 p.m. when Sagar came there on his bike. “The unsuspecting boy, who knew Sagar, sat on the bike when he offered him a ride,” the SP said.

Two hours later, the boy’s parents received a call on their mobile phone from a private number demanding ₹45 lakh ransom to set him free. Worried parents rushed to police who swung into action forming dedicated teams with specific tasks to trace boy.

Normally, police would have tracked the abductors by tracing the phone calls. In this case, they hit a cul-de-sac as the incoming call did not display on parents’ mobile phone except showing ‘private number’. Realising that abductor was using VoIP to make calls, investigators sent emails to 10 companies providing VoIP call services.

Investigation in this angle provided some clues. Actually, even before police chalked out a plan to rescue the boy, Sagar murdered the boy. “Though the boy knew Sagar, he started asking the latter to take him back home. Unable to control the kid and worried of being identified, Sagar, gave him a sleeping pill,” the SP said.

When the boy fell unconscious, the accused throttled him to death. Later, Sagar poured petrol on the body and set it ablaze, he said. Even after killing the boy, he started making ransom calls. Police officers from special wings like Hyderabad Task Force, Cyberabad Special Operations Team and Intelligence along with technical experts started working on different leads to trace the boy.

Meanwhile, police received an input locally pointing the needle of suspicion towards Sagar who admitted to the killing when picked up and interrogated. He led the police to the boy’s decomposed body which was found on a hillock in nearby Thallapoosalapally forest area.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/l68gjl/article32915491.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/telanganapolicejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kidnapped-boy-found-murdered-in-telangana/article32915104.ece

229,2020/10/22,Kalakriti's new exhibition focuses on emerging contemporary artists and their diverse voices,"An ongoing exhibition highlights new voices in contemporary art that focus on urbanisation, spiritual journeys and human networks

Kusum Lata Sharma is an art practitioner and researcher in Bhopal, which is often referred to as a city of lakes. A few years ago, she began a contemporary art series ‘Water Hyacinth’. Having worked on a 100 paintings in the series, she asserts that art has to reflect reality — in this case, disruption of ecological balance. A few paintings from the ‘Water Hyacinth’ series are on view at Kalakriti art gallery, Hyderabad, and the gallery’s website (kalakritiartgallery.com).

The ongoing exhibition ‘Through the Looking Glass: New Voices in Contemporary Art’ dips into the diverse viewpoints and techniques of emerging contemporary artists.

A painting by Kusum Lata Sharma

“At first, the water hyacinth appears beautiful, glistening in the sun rays. Soon, it takes over the water body and the aquatic life is deprived of oxygen and nutrients. I’ve tried to convey this dichotomy, using symbolism and abstraction,” says Kusum. She compares this takeover of the water hyacinth to the rampant urbanisation in cities where the quality of life takes a hit.

Her paintings are elaborately detailed, over several layers, offering a bird’s eye view of a city and its plight. In her Dream City series, she allows her imagination to soar and says, “dreams are limitless, full of possibilities.”

Protyusha Mitra, Balagopalan Bala, Nishant Dange, Sumit Banerjee, Uday Goswami, Ekta Sharma and Divya Patwa are among the many featured artists.

Diverse techniques

Aishwarya Sultania’s Network

Among the artworks on display, mixed media sculptural installations by Aishwarya Sultania deserve a mention. She has been working extensively with wood, carving or etching them, and at times using them as part of a larger work. In a ‘Network’, she rethinks the ‘six degrees of separation’ in a contemporary, shrinking world where people are interconnected more than ever before. The ‘jalebi’ symbolises the network.

The jalebi is a recurring motif in her art and ironically, Aishwarya explains that when she first did a jalebi mixed media work, it was rejected by an art gallery: “But I persuaded; and it was the first piece to be sold!” In another set of five works, she depicts the life of Buddha, adding a gold-tinted aluminium foil to hint at the enlightenment.

A painting by Ekta Singha

Artist Ekta Singha looks back at the past — her family lineage that can be traced to a royal Rajput family — and on the other hand, reflects her journey of sharing a hostel room while studying art. An image of mattresses piled up in the hostel room, for instance, is from her series on everyday life. In ‘Story of a Kingdom’ and ‘Joint Family’ series, she shares stories of her family using techniques such as the sepia-tinted, faded or burnt pages from a diary.

Transformative journey

The paintings of French artist Claire Lono who currently lives in Auroville, Pondicherry, have a meditative quality to them as she depicts her own transformative, spiritual journey in calming hues of sky blues and sea greens. She uses her work to introspect on life and how she embraced simplicity in Auroville. In ‘Passages’, she uses the moon as a symbol of the spiritual journey. In yet another painting ‘The call of the divine flute player’, she doesn’t figuratively represent Krishna or the flute but focuses on the atmospherics of the musical call.

Swim by Smita Gupta

Smita Gupta’s flowy textures are a result of she allowing the fluidity of the colours (alcohol ink on paper) guide her as she paints: “My work is never pre-planned,” she says. The feminine form, the earth and Krishna emerge from this fluid merging of one colour and pattern into another.

230,2020/10/22,Artist Bhavya Desai’s new series ‘While you were asleep’ is an ode to the night shift workers,"Chennai-based digital artist Bhavya Desai’s new series celebrates the men and women who build our city before the first ray of light hits the streets

Thrice every week, before 5 am, artist Bhavya Desai has his eyes peeled as he travels from his home in Thiruvanmiyur to his karate class in Besant Nagar.

He studies every passer-by: the man who sells tea to the watchmen wrapping up their night shift, the sanitation worker sweeping her last lane for the night, the milkman segregating packets into crates, and the newspaper man about his route.

Each of these people makes their way into Bhavya’s latest series, ‘While you were asleep’. The characters, in his trademark style, are cartoonish, with wide eyes, spindly arms, and in goofy situations.

Since he picked up his pen to draw in 2015, Bhavya’s work has often reflected the spirit of Chennai — from colourful bustling tea stalls to porters scooting across the platforms of Central Railway Station. He says, “All these years, I have been drawing whoever I see around me. This time, I wanted to draw those that we don’t see on a regular day,” the ones who worked under the cloak of night.

“These are the people who make a big difference in our society before we have even begun our day. Our economy starts with them,” he says.

The characters he draws are imaginary, although they are inspired by real people. “I exercise my own imagination in creating narratives, but I try and take characteristics from them: their body language, and expression.”

He prefers to observe the people he caricatures without interacting with them. “For this series, I didn’t want to intrude upon them while they were working, I want to see them as who they are, naturally.”

This was not the case in his previous series, where he was commissioned to illustrate the pre-Independence heritage eateries of Calcutta.

“I would ask the cooks if I could take 15 minutes of their time and speak to them about their work, families, and backgrounds. They gave me their 100% while speaking to me, but after that it sounded fake if I asked them to go back to what they were doing. They would become very conscious, so that’s why I didn’t want to do that this time,” he says.

His first sketch, that of an egg-seller, received immense response especially from late risers, with people suggesting what other professions he could cover. This motivated him to continue the series. He chose 12 in total in case the sketches could one day be turned into a calendar. “I think practising karate also gave me that discipline to stick to a project and not get distracted by other ideas,” he muses.

Bhavya is happy he is developing the skill of giving a theme and context to his caricatures. “When I started, I was just drawing everything in sight, without any backstory, like a headless chicken!”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/pzcxnq/article32908868.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPBhavya3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/chennai-artist-bhavya-desai-series-while-you-were-asleep/article32908869.ece
231,2020/10/22,PM to inaugurate top Gujarat projects via video conference,"Newly built ropeway, electricity scheme for farmers, and a paediatric heart hospital in Ahmedabad will be launched

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate three important projects in Gujarat through video conference. The projects are a newly built ropeway over Gujarat’s highest mountain range Girnar; an electricity scheme for farmers; and a paediatric heart hospital in Ahmedabad.

Also read: PM Modi to unveil projects worth ₹16,000 crore in Bihar ahead of Assembly poll

Of the three, the Girnar ropeway is the main project, which has been developed after decades of controversy over adverse environmental impact and other factors.

To start with there will be 25-30 cabins, with a capacity of eight people per cabin in the ropeway over Girnar mountain in Junagadh, which is a noted pilgrimage site and historical tourist hub in the Saurashtra region.

A distance of 2.3 km will now be covered in just 7.5 minutes over the ropeway. According to the Gujarat government’s estimate, the ropeway will make Junagadh a major tourism hub. There are two important temples along the way — a Jain temple is situated mid-way, and a Datatreya temple is located at the top.

Under the Kisan Suryodaya Yojana, which envisages providing day-time power supply for irrigation, farmers will get electricity from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. for irrigation purposes.

The State government has allocated a budget of ₹3,500 crore for the installation of transmission infrastructure under the scheme by 2023. Over 234 “66-Kilowatt” transmission lines, with a total length of 3,490 circuit kilometres (CKM) will be established under the project, in addition to 220 KV substations.

In the first phase, districts like Dahod, Patan, Mahisagar, Panchmahal, Chhota Udepur, Kheda, Tapi, Valsad, Anand and Gir-Somnath have been included under the scheme for 2020-21, while the remaining districts will be covered in the second phase by 2022-23.

With the inauguration of the Paediatric Heart Hospital attached with the U.N. Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre, the institute will now become the country’s biggest hospital for cardiology. The State government-run hospital is undergoing expansion at a cost of ₹470 crore and is slated to become a world-class facility. The number of beds will increase from 450 to 1,251 after the the expansion is completed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hqt5jw/article32826540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pm-to-inaugurate-top-gujarat-projects-via-video-conference/article32920459.ece
232,2020/10/22,Night curfew withdrawn during Durga Puja days in Tripura,"Government doctors caution people against crowding pandals.

The Tripura government has revised its decision on State-wide night curfew during the Durga Puja festival. Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar in a fresh memorandum said it appeared prudent not to impose the curfew during the puja days as it will increase crowding during the non-curfew period.

The Chief Secretary said cancellation of night curfew would commence on Friday. He said the district Magistrates can take the decision on enforcing curfew in any area of the district concerned.

The All Tripura Government Doctors Association (ATGDA) cautioned that the virus situation could aggravate if people violate guidelines and precautions during the festival days. Its general secretary Rajesh Choudhury appealed to revellers to refrain from crowding in the pandals, streets and eateries.

The association urged the State government to fill up vacancies of doctors, nurses and health workers. He said early appointments are necessary to cope with the general coronavirus (COVID-19) situation as around 200 doctors of government health facilities are under quarantine after contracting the virus.

233,2020/10/22,"Madhya Pradesh bypolls a prestige battle for Scindia, Kamal Nath","The former Congress leader’s sway over 16 seats up for grabs remains a crucial factor.

Amid portraits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president J.P. Nadda and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on the hoardings at the party’s Bhopal office, the absence of a popular face, whose 19 supporters are in the fray for the 28 bypolls after pulling down the Congress government in March, is glaring.

“Members of the party, even if a Maharaj, have to stick to its discipline and convention,” explained a worker, referring to the royal ancestry of Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scinda who does not figure on the hoardings.

People's court: On Madhya Pradesh by-elections

Mr. Scindia, who led the Congress to victory in the Assembly elections in 2018, is now a BJP member but his stature as a new entrant and unyielding stiffness has meant that he is eclipsed by the party’s more committed, older leaders.

The byelections to 28 seats in Madhya Pradesh will decide the fate of the seven-month-old Shivraj Singh Chouhan government. Twenty-five seats fell vacant after the defection of 22 Congress MLAs — 19 of whom backed Mr. Scindia — and three others later. Three other seats have fallen vacant after the deaths of sitting legislators.

However, the polls are more a prestige battle between Mr. Scindia, who left the Congress and is eyeing a Ministerial Berth at the Centre, and former Congress Chief Minister Kamal Nath.

The BJP has given a ticket to all the defectors.

Also read: I understood that Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh will ruin the Congress govt. in months, says Jyotiraditya Scindia

The Congress, which won 27 of the 28 seats in 2018, needs to win all to pull up its tally of 88 MLAs and wrest power again. However, after the political drama of the defections and change of government, it can no longer rely on the support of the four independent, two Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the lone Samajwadi legislators, which had helped it cross the 115 simple majority mark previously.

The BSP MLAs seemingly backed the BJP during the political turmoil, while independents are eager to secure ministerial berths, irrespective of the party in government.

Meanwhile, the BJP needs to extend its tally of 107 by at least nine seats in the 230-member Assembly to retain power.

With 16 seats up for grabs in the Gwalior-Chambal region, the Scindia stronghold, the BJP is drawing strength from the former Congress leader’s cadre. In 2018, Mr. Scindia’s popularity was just behind that of Mr. Chouhan, far exceeding that of Mr. Nath, according to a CSDS-Madhya Pradesh Post-Poll Survey 2018. Yet the denial of the Chief Minister's post sparked off discontentment which led to the fall of the Congress government.

Also read: Not angry with Scindia, says CM Kamal Nath

With Mr. Nath leading the campaign, the Congress’ appeal to voters is to salvage democracy by bringing back the party to power. It is also seeking to garner support by highlighting its the opposition to the Centre’s three recent farm Acts, police brutalities and atrocities against Dalits, the spread of the sand and liquor mafia in the State and the BJP government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Faced with an erosion of its cadre in Gwalior-Chambal after Mr. Scindia’s exit, the party has been scrambling to revive its organisation locally.

The non-fulfilment of election promises most prominently of waiving crop loans within 10 days of government is the major poll plank of the BJP, which is also pointing to Mr. Nath’s reported ignorance of farmers’ issues and ‘poor-performance’ as a Chief Minister.

Both the parties are intent on wooing the Dalit vote as nine seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes candidates. But the BSP’s considerable popularity among Jatavs in pockets adjacent to Uttar Pradesh such as Chambal and Vindhya Pradesh is likely to throw a triangular contest on a few seats. In 2018, the party secured the second spot on Gohad, Dabra and Pohri, while altered results on Gwalior, Gwalior East and Mungaoli. Two of its contestants this time are former Congressman.

Also read: Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sachin Pilot were the ‘princelings’ of Congress, says Manish Tewari

The Congress vote share jumped by nearly four points to 40.85% in the 2018 election, marginally behind the 40.91% of the BJP, which has ruled the State for 15 years.

On the 34 seats of Chambal, the Congress had won 26 with Mr. Scindia’s support and the BJP just seven.

This time, the Congress is seeking to reap dividends through the tropes of ‘honour’ and ‘pride’, that still hold currency in Chambal especially, asking voters to reject ‘traitors’ and ‘sold out’ leaders to win maximum seats in Bhind and Morena districts.

Former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh, first within the Congress to flag reported the BJP’s efforts by the BJP to lure its MLAs in March, has receded to the background, left to placate those upset at being denied a ticket. Often identified by the BJP as responsible for ‘infighting’ within the Congress which led to the fall of the government, Mr. Singh was even accused by a Congress Minister last year of attempting to destabilise it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oqkt0y/article32922048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TH-KAMALjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-a-prestige-battle-for-scindia-kamal-nath/article32919464.ece

Both Kerala and Maharashtra were reporting a very high number of new cases, with more than 8,000 cases each, followed by Karnataka, with more than 5,000 cases, a Ministry release said.

India also reported 702 case fatalities, as per the data. Of this, nearly 82% was concentrated in 10 States/UTs and more than 25% of the new fatalities were from Maharashtra (180), the Ministry said.

The active cases have been sustained below 10% of the total cases for the last three days, and presently, they comprised 9.29% of the total positive cases of the country standing at 7,15,812, the release stated.

“The positivity rate has also been maintained to less than 5% over the past three days, indicating that the spread of infection is being effectively contained through focussed strategies and actions of the Centre and the States/UTs.

Not the last pandemic: WHO

WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a release issued on Thursday, said that with the ongoing pandemic, it had never been clearer that health was a political and economic choice.

“In the past 20 years, countries have invested heavily in preparing for terrorist attacks, but relatively little in preparing for the attack of a virus – which, as the COVID-19 pandemic has proven, can be far more deadly, disruptive and costly,’’ he said. This would not be the last pandemic, he noted.

“But when the next one comes, the world must be ready. Part of every country’s commitment to build back better must therefore be to public health, as an investment in a healthier and safer future,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/q7pfq1/article32919254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22IN-KERALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-kerala-reports-most-covid-19-cases-maharashtra-continues-to-register-most-deaths/article32919255.ece
235,2020/10/22,Assam-Mizoram border issue: Trucks resume movement after four days,"Cachar district official spokesperson said, “More than 140 trucks have crossed over to Mizoram since this morning. A few trucks have also reached Lailapur from across the border.”

A day after Assam and Mizoram agree to restore peace and normalcy on the inter-State boundary following a clash, movement of trucks carrying essential items has resumed after four days, officials of the two States said on Thursday.

Trucks that got stranded on both sides of the border since the clash between the people of the two States on Saturday night have started moving since this morning, though a major student body of Mizoram has launched a blockade on National Highway-306, which links the two neighbouring States.

The student body Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) said it has started the blockade at Vairengte in Mizoram’s Kolasib district near the border since Wednesday evening, claiming that people of Lailapur in Assam’s Cachar district have also put up a blockade.

MZP president B. Vanlaltana said that the agitation was also intended to protect Mizoram’s territory and mount pressure on the Centre and the State governments to resolve the long-standing inter-State border dispute.

Mr. Vanlaltana said that 11 MZP leaders, including the vice-president Peter Chhangte were arrested in the small hours of Thursday for staging the blockade. The police, however denied this. Kolasib district Superintendent of Police Vanlalfaka Ralte, told PTI that some trucks carrying essential commodities have entered the State under police escort on Thursday morning from neighbouring Cachar district of Assam.

Cachar district official spokesperson said, “More than 140 trucks have crossed over to Mizoram since this morning. A few trucks have also reached Lailapur from across the border.”

Meanwhile, Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga has instructed officials to ask security forces not to withdraw from the border areas till a final decision is made by the Centre on the matter and normalcy returns to the area.

Several people were injured in the clash that occurred between the people of the two States, during which several makeshift huts were torched on Saturday night.

A home secretary-level meeting was held on Wednesday on the issue, in which the joint secretary to the Ministry of Home Affairs (in-charge of North East), Satyendra Garg, was also present.

Both the States agreed to restore peace and tranquillity along the border areas, provide security and instil a sense of safety among the people there. Mr. Garg held meetings with the Mizoram Chief Secretary and NGOs on Thursday in Aizawl over the border issue. He also called on Chief Minister Zoramthanga, officials said.

Mizoram shares a 164.6km border with Assam. Several dialogues held since 1995 to resolve the boundary problem have yielded little results.

Meanwhile, a report from Imphal said that the Kuki Inpi Manipur, the apex body of Kuki tribes of Manipur, urged the Assam government to restore peace and normalcy in its border with Mizoram so that supply of essential commodities is not affected in the area.

Kukis belong to a kindred tribe of the Mizos and they live mainly Manipur’s southern district of Churachandpur which shares border with both Mizoram and Assam.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-mizoram-border-issue-trucks-resume-movement-after-four-days/article32918883.ece
236,2020/10/22,"Rendered jobless, Odisha civil engineer labours under MGNREGA","He opted to assist his daily wager father as pandemic brought acute financial distress to their home

An engineering graduate was found labouring under a Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme in Odisha’s Balangir district as the job market battered by COVID-19 is yet to open up.

It was on a regular field inspection of Balangir on Tuesday that District Collector Chanchal Rana came across a young man working silently, removing soil with a spade.

When asked, the young man, Anant Beria, identified himself as a civil engineering graduate. Mr. Beria said he had lost his job as a supervisor with Chennai-based construction company during the COVID-19 lockdown.

“It did disturb me. As an engineering graduate, he was supposed to be in a better place, doing more skilful work. But as we know, the pandemic is unprecedented in nature and brought out untold human miseries,” said Mr. Rana.

Mr. Beria, who has three other siblings, was brought up with much hardship by his father Baisakhu Beria, a daily wager, in Jurlakani village under Degaon block of Balangir.

After clearing his civil engineering graduation, he got a job in Chennai and was supervising construction work before being forced to return to his village due to the COVID-19 lockdown. However, Mr. Beria could not get job, even though some normalcy was restored in the past couple of months. With the financial crisis at home becoming acute, Mr. Beria opted to assist his father in MGNREGA work.

“We have offered Mr. Beria temporary work in our MGNREGA monitoring cell, where he will get more skilful work. We have asked him to utilise the opportunity to study hard and try to get a permanent job,” said the Balangir District Collector.

Balangir, one of the most migration-prone districts of Odisha, sends thousands of poverty-stricken families to work in brick kilns and construction sectors of other States every year.

Mr. Rana admitted people were being provided advance wages for migration through informal channels.

“This year, we have tried to provide enough jobs under MGNREGA to people so that they could earn for their family members. More than 65 lakh man-days have been created in six months. This target is usually achieved under MGNREGA in one year,” he explained.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3b9woa/article32918804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MGNREGA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rendered-jobless-odisha-civil-engineer-labours-under-mgnrega/article32918805.ece
237,2020/10/22,Hoteliers in Himachal Pradesh seek government support to revive industry,"Run inter-State a\c buses and waive taxes and electricity tariff, they say

Reeling under losses amid several restrictions on travelling to the State due to COVID-19, the Federation of Himachal Hotels and Restaurants has asked the State government to come to its rescue.

The hospitality industry has taken a severe hit. The State government allowed unrestricted entry into the State from mid-September, which came as a big relief for the the hard-pressed tourism sector. However, hoteliers in the hill State feel government needs to immediately come to the aid of the industry to put it back on track.

“Our industry is in dire straits. Hotels and restaurants have remained shut for about six months and only recently have started opening for tourists. Inter-State air-conditioned buses are still not operating and railways are still to resume normal operations. Sentiments of the tourists are down. Tourists from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Bengal, who used to travel in bulk during the Dasara-Diwali holidays, are not coming this year. We are only getting a few tourists from Punjab and Haryana on the weekends,” Sanjay Sood, vice-president of the Federation, told The Hindu on Thursday.

Mr. Sood said even by the most conservative estimates, it will take nothing less than a year and half before businesses might see some recoveries. “The low occupancy has impacted the revenue generation and hotels are not in a position to pay for the house tax and other levies in this financial year. There is hardly 20%-25 % occupancy in hotels, and thus the power load consumption is also not more than 20%-25% of the connected load. In these difficult times, we want the Electricity Board not to make profit out of the misery of the hoteliers. We request full waiver of load charges for at least another six months,” he said.

“We also urge the State government to allow movement of inter-State AC buses as in the absence of proper air connectivity in the State, these buses are the only viable and comfortable mode of transportation for the inter-State tourists. Hotel industry is on the verge of collapse and we look forward towards the State government to save it by waivers,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/n1abhj/article32918800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDEXSHIMLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hoteliers-in-himachal-pradesh-seek-government-support-to-revive-industry/article32918801.ece
238,2020/10/22,Relief for Mukhtar Ansari’s sons,"Allahabad HC grants interim relief from arrest

The Allahabad High Court has granted interim relief from arrest to the two sons of jailed MLA Mukhtar Ansari in a case of alleged illegal occupation of government land.

An FIR was lodged against the MLA and his two sons Abbas Ansari and Umar Ansari in Hazratganj police station of Lucknow in August on charges of illegal occupation.

The charges included criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and Section 3 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. Mr. Abbas Ansari is a national-level shooter and had also contested the 2017 Assembly elections only to lose by a thin margin.

“Having regard to the overall facts and circumstances, as discussed above, the petitioners have been able to make out the case for grant of interim relief,” the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court said.

A division bench of Justices Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Saroj Yadav in an order dated October 21 noted that the investigation in the case would go on and that the petitioners will fully cooperate with the investigating agency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/iwo699/article32918495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-ALLAHABADHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/relief-for-mukhtar-ansaris-sons/article32918499.ece
239,2020/10/22,Odisha tribal student migrating to earn a smartphone for online schooling rescued,"Generous government officer gives a smartphone to Malkangiri Class IX student

A meritorious tribal student, who was about to migrate as a daily wager just to earn enough for buying a smartphone for his online classes, was rescued in Odisha’s Malkangiri district, 650 km from here.

After his rescue, a generous government officer donated a smartphone to ensure that he did not drop out from the school.

The poignant story of Surendra Kumar Khara, a Class IX student in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya-1 in Malkangiri district has brought the focus back on children being deprived of an education due to the lack of access to online facilities during the pandemic.

Surendra, who belongs to Kondh tribe, is a first generation learner in his family and first one to attend an English medium school from his village, Bijaghati.

At the age of 18, he would have been in college. But Surendra did not have a smooth initiation into school due to his family’s impoverished financial circumstances and lack of awareness. His 17-year-old brother and 14-year-old sister have already dropped out from school and become daily wagers.

“I made the entrance for the Jawahar Navodaya schools in Class V, and since then I have been studying near the district headquarter town of Malkangiri. Like all students, I was stranded in my village due to the pandemic,” said the boy.

“Due to the lack of a smartphone, I could not start my formal studies this academic season. Though I had textbooks, there was no one in my village to guide me. Apprehending that I would lag behind in studies, I decided to migrate to Bhadrachalam in Telangana, work there for two months, and return with a smartphone for resuming studies,” he said.

When the labour agent was taking the group, including two minors, on October 11, Surendra and others suspected that they were not being taken to Bhadrachalam as was agreed, but to Bengaluru. They protested and tried to return to their village. As the labour agent used force to take them along with him, members of Jai Malkangiri, a volunteers’ group, spotted them and handed them over to the police. A case in this regard was registered with the Malkangiri Police Station.

On being informed, Alok Kumar Anugulia, Kalimela Tahasildar, rushed to Bijaghati. “The incident did not surprise me. Being a native of Malkangiri, I have seen many people leaving their studies just because they did not have ₹1,000 or ₹2,000. I did not want the student dropping out because of a smartphone. I gave him a smartphone. He has already resumed his studies,” said Mr. Anugulia.

According to Samir Ranjan Dash, School and Mass Education Minister, about 38 lakh out of 60 lakh students in Odisha did not have access to online education. When the lockdown was lifted, the number of 22 lakh students accessing online education dropped further to 7-8 lakh as parents took the only smartphone in the family to their workplaces.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8yrc1x/article32918164.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Malkangiri-3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-tribal-student-migrating-to-earn-a-smartphone-for-online-schooling-rescued/article32918165.ece
240,2020/10/22,Supreme Court closes case filed by Iltija Mufti against detention of her mother Mehbooba Mufti,"Bench dismisses petition as infructuous on learning that the former J&K CM has already been released

The Supreme Court on Thursday closed a petition filed by Iltija Mufti seeking the immediate release and whereabouts of her mother and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister, Mehbooba Mufti.

A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul dismissed the petition as infructuous on learning from Iltija’s lawyer, advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, that Ms. Mufti has already been released.

“Good,” Justice Kaul reacted to Ms. Ramakrishnan’s submission.

Ms. Mufti was released on October 13. She had been detained under the Public Safety Act (PSA).

In its previous hearing on September 29, the court had asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration on how long it proposed to keep Ms. Mufti under detention.

The question had come a day after the Srinagar District Magistrate, on September 28, reasoned in an affidavit to the court that the detention was ordered on the basis of an extensive scrutiny of the material on Ms. Mufti, which showed a “past conduct” of “glorifying militants, brazenly inciting religion to divide the people, demoralising the security forces and the proclivity to indulge in such behaviour in future which would be highly prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/die3sq/article32753543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MEHBOOBAMUFTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/supreme-court-closes-case-filed-by-iltija-mufti-against-detention-of-her-mother-mehbooba-mufti/article32862153.ece
241,2020/10/22,Eight more arrested by Maharashtra CID in Palghar mob lynching case,"With this, 186 people have so far been arrested and 11 juveniles detained in connection with the incident.

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of Maharashtra police on Thursday arrested eight more people in connection with the lynching of three persons by a mob in Palghar district in April this year, a police official said.

With this, 186 people have so far been arrested and 11 juveniles detained in connection with the incident. After the arrest of 24 people on Wednesday, the police nabbed eight more persons on Thursday, the official said.

He said these accused were present at the incident spot amid the COVID-19 pandemic and also did not stop the assault on the three victims. Some of these people were also recording videos of the incident and some were involved in the clamour at that time. The accused also had sticks in their hands, the official said.

On April 16, two seers and their driver, who were heading towards Surat from Mumbai in a car, were beaten to death by a mob in Palghar’s Gadchinchlale village on suspicion that they were child-lifters.

The accused in the case were charged with murder, armed rioting and using criminal force to prevent a public servant from doing his duty, among other offences, the police said. Earlier, the Palghar police had conducted a probe into the case, but it was later handed over to the State CID.

243,2020/10/22,"Rescinded order to ensure CBI not misused, says Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh","Deshmukh referred to the apprehension, saying the government wanted to avoid such a thing happening.

A day after the State government withdrew “general consent” given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases in the State, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the step was taken to ensure that the Central agency is not misused for political purpose.

“CBI will need Maharashtra governments permission henceforth (to operate in the state). It can’t carry out investigation here in Mumbai till we issue permission,” the Minister told reporters on Thursday.

Maharashtra government on Wednesday withdrew general consent given to the agency to probe cases in the State, a day after CBI took over a case registered by UP Police against “unknown” channels and persons over alleged fudging of TRPs.

The move follows apprehension in the State government that the CBI would take over a similar case on alleged fudging of TRPs in Maharashtra in a bid to move it away from the purview of Mumbai police.

Nr. Deshmukh referred to the apprehension, saying the government wanted to avoid such a thing happening.

The CBI was formed as per Delhi Police Establishment Act, Mr. Deshmukh said.

The State Home Department’s order issued on Wednesday said, “In exercise of the powers conferred by section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, the government of Maharashtra hereby withdraws the consent accorded to the Members of the Delhi Special Police Establishment vide Government Order dated February 22, 1989.”

“CBI had been given a free pass by the earlier government. We have withdrawn it. We thought about political scores being settled through CBI. So we have withdrawn the permission granted earlier to avoid such a thing happening,” he said.

“Earlier, CBI had taken up the investigation in some cases. We are concerned about use of CBI to intervene in the ongoing TRP scam and hence Maharashtra decided to withdraw its permission,” the minister said.

Mr. Deshmukh said a Supreme Court judge had a few years ago described CBI as the “government’s parrot”. “We want to avoid it happening now,” the Minister said.

After registering an FIR on October 6, Mumbai police had claimed that three channels, including Republic TV, were prima facie involved in manipulating TRPs. Republic TV had subsequently approached the Bombay High Court, where its counsel had asked for the case to be transferred to the CBI.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ykupvj/article32917456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANILDESHMUKH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rescinded-order-to-ensure-cbi-not-misused-says-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh/article32917457.ece

A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment

“We have received four FIRs so far, two of Hathras, one of Aligarh and one of Mathura, and we will be looking into them in detail, the official said, adding the Mathura case relating to arrest of four persons allegedly linked to the PFI will also be probed.

The official refused to divulge further details.

Amid the massive outrage over the alleged gang rape and killing of a Dalit woman, the UP police had filed around 19 cases in different parts of the state against “unknown” persons and invoked the sedition charge against them for attempting to trigger a caste conflict and tarnish the UP government’s image.

The FIR lodged at Chandpa police station in Hathras had mentioned 19 IPC sections, including 124A (sedition), 505 (intending to cause public alarm and inducing someone to commit offence against state or public tranquillity), 153A (promoting enmity between groups).

245,2020/10/22,"Lokayukta notices to Odisha MLA, engineers for alleged destruction of embankment","The embankment was blown away using dynamites in order to give an impression that swirling floodwaters had caused the breach, alleges an RTI activist in a petition.

Odisha Lokayukta has issued notices to six persons, including a Member of Legislative Assembly, in connection with alleged deliberate destruction of an irrigation embankment in order to cover up corruption and substandard work.

An RTI activist, Sarbeswar Beura, filed a petition with the Lokayukta alleging that some people, who were involved in substandard construction of an irrigation embankment in Jajpur district, had deliberately blown away the embankment using dynamites in order to give an impression that swirling floodwaters had caused the breach.

According to Mr. Beura, the incident had taken place on night of August 28 where there was flood water in Keura River under Dharmasala block of Jajpur district. The embankment between Gokarneswar and Budhalinga Majhipada Road was damaged, causing the loss of paddy in 4,000 hectares.

People noticed that the breach in the embankment was not natural, but man-made. “It is alleged that Pranab Balabantaray, local BJD MLA, and Naren Jena, junior engineer of office of the executive engineer, Panikoili Road and Building Division were behind the conspiracy. They had engaged miscreants to damage this embankment with explosives in order to suppress the irregularities and misappropriation of huge amount of money in the construction work,” activist submitted.

As per the petition, the project was sanctioned at an estimate of ₹21.99 crore to one Balakrushna Mohanty in 2016. The work was to be completed by April 30, 2018. However, the contractor faced problem due to political interference. The project got delayed for which project cost was escalated to ₹ 24.47 crore.

“The construction of the embankment ended in last part of 2019. Having seen the low quality of work, I had filed RTI application which was rejected. Authorities apprehended that corruption could have been exposed. The low quality of work was highly visible in the road,” Mr. Beura alleged.

As the issue was highlighted in newspapers, the top government authorities had admitted that the destruction of embankment was man-made. Even the Road and Building Department had lodged a complaint with Dharmasala Police seeking inquiry into the breach.

Mr. Beura urged the Lokayukta to conduct an inquiry by engaging a technical expert team and Crime Branch, Odisha police, to find out the reasons behind destruction of embankment, miscreants involved, and involvement of local MLA and officials. He had sought stringent legal action against the people responsible for it.

Lokayukta issued notices to Jajpur District Collector, Chief Engineer of Department of Works, MLA Mr. Balabantaray, Mr. Jena, junior engineer and execute engineer, and his deputy of Roads and Building division of Panikoili. It listed the matter on December 3.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lokayukta-notices-to-odisha-mla-engineers-for-alleged-destruction-of-embankment/article32916536.ece
246,2020/10/22,Allahabad HC restrains Ghaziabad Development Authority from demolition in slum area,"Bench says it is the responsibility of the State to protect the weak during the COVID-19 pandemic

The Allahabad High Court has restrained the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) from carrying out demolition in a slum area in Ghaziabad, noting that the State should have offered a place to rehabilitate the residents before their eviction and demolition of their houses.

“It would also be appropriate to state that when the entire globe is facing a pandemic, it is the responsibility of the State to protect everyone, more specifically the population of weaker sections from any hardship that may aggravate their plight adversely,” the court stated.

It was hearing a petition seeking directions to the GDA to not undertake any further demolition and or eviction of residents of Bhovapur Basti behind Radisson Blue Hotel, Kaushambi, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.

In an order dated October 21, a Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Siddhartha Varma, while granting time to the GDA to file a counter affidavit, directed it not to proceed with the demolition till further orders.

The court also issued directions to provide temporary shelter to the residents of Bhovapur Basti whose houses have already been demolished and see to the viability of providing houses under the Pradhan Mantri Avas Yojna. All necessary arrangements should also be made as a temporary measure by the GDA to provide essential amenities, including light and water, to the residents.

Medical facilities

The residents should also be extended all necessary medical facilities, the court said, and listed the next date for November 18 when the GDA would have to propose a complete plan for rehabilitation of the residents.

As per the petition, the ‘basti’ came into existence in 1990 and labourers from different parts of the country live there. Some are involved in rag-picking.

The counsel for the petitioners had argued that the residents could not be evicted without providing them an alternative place of residence as prescribed under the Proviso to Section 26-A of the Uttar Pradesh Planning and Development Act, 1973.

Since the residents hailed from the lower section of society and looking to the need for rehabilitation of such persons, the State Legislature under the Act of 1973 protected their right of residence under the Proviso to Section 26-A, the petitioners had said.

Compensation sought

The petitioners also prayed that the court direct the GDA and the State to undertake the complete rehabilitation of all the residents and pay ₹20,000 to each of them as compensation for unlawful demolition undertaken on September 30 and October 9.

As per the petitioner, the District Administration, Ghaziabad, at the instance of Ghaziabad Development Authority was continuously making efforts to remove the residents without providing them any alternative land for their rehabilitation.

The petitioners asserted that on October 9, some of the houses were damaged as an effort was made to evict the residents.

Apprehending complete demolition of houses, the writ was filed.

150 houses demolished

A.Q. Zaidi, counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners, said that about 150 houses had already been demolished by the GDA. According to the counsel, the residents whose houses have been demolished have no roof to protect themselves and they are living in the open.

While opposing the writ, the lawyer appearing on behalf of the GDA stated that whatever action taken by the Authority was in compliance of the directions given by the High Court on September 22, 2015 in PIL 2014 of 2015. It was also further by the administration stated that the residents of Bhovapur Basti were trespassers and, therefore, the encroachment made by them should be removed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/15zmks/article32915761.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDGHAZIABADSLUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/allahabad-hc-restrains-ghaziabad-development-authority-from-demolition-in-slum-area/article32915762.ece
247,2020/10/22,Punjab’s farm laws an alternative model to market produce: Chidamabaram,"One System One Country will wreck federalism, says ex-Finance Minister

A day after Congress-ruled Punjab became the first State to pass it’s own laws to negate the Central laws on the agricultural sector, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Wednesday argued that the law passed by the Assembly should be viewed as an ‘alternative’ model to market produce.

In a series of tweets, Mr. Chidambaram argued that “One Country One system will wreck federalism”.

“Modi government has adopted a model of agricultural produce marketing, Punjab government has adopted another model. Why can’t there be two models of marketing farm produce in a large country like India? Article 254 of the Constitution gives that right to every State,” he said.

The former Union Minister argued that in a federal system “there is space for as many models as there are States”.

“One Country One System will lead to mediocrity and wreck federalism. Let the people of each State decide which model they want. That is a decision that the people must make, not the Governor or the President.”

The Congress and the BJP are engaged in a bitter battle over the recently enacted farm laws that propose to drastically change the way agricultural commodities are marketed in India.

While the Congress alleges that the new laws would disempower farmers by allowing large corporates to enter the agri sector and put an end to the system of offering minimum support price (MSP), the BJP, on the contrary, has argued that the new laws will remove restrictions and will enable farmers to market their produce freely without compromising on the MSP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjabs-farm-laws-an-alternative-model-to-market-produce-chidamabaram/article32913339.ece
248,2020/10/22,CM hits back after Oppn. ‘U-turn’ on Punjab Bills,"He questions their dual stance inside and outside Assembly

A day after the Punjab Assembly ‘unanimously’ passed three amendment Bills to negate the Central farm laws, Opposition criticism prompted Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to express “amazement” at their “double standards”. He said they [Shiromani Akali Dal and Aam Aadmi Party] spoke in favour of the Bills in the Assembly, and even went with him to meet the Punjab Governor, but said different things outside.

“It is more than clear that these parties are not interested in securing the future of the farmers or protecting the State’s agriculture and economy,” said Capt. Amarinder.

He said the SAD and AAP were playing to the gallery by pretending to back the Bills in the Assembly on Tuesday. “Their lack of sincerity towards the farmers’ cause has been totally exposed by their statements thereafter. If they thought we were fooling the people of Punjab, why did they not say so in the House? Why did they support and vote for our Bills?” said the Chief Minister.

Reacting to Arvind Kejriwal’s tweet raising doubts about the effectiveness of the amendment Bills, Capt. Amarinder said it smacked of total ignorance on the part of the Delhi Chief Minister. He said instead of questioning his government’s Bills, it would be better for Mr. Kejriwal to “get out of the IT mindset” and ask AAP’s Punjab unit to back the State government in its fight for the rights of the farmers, unless their support to Bills was just a façade. “The ball is in your court — are you with farmers or against them,” he asked the Delhi Chief Minister, challenging him to come out with a categorical stand on the issue of the Punjab amendment Bills.

SAD leader and former Minister Bikram Singh Majithia said that the Bills, and the manner in which they had been brought and passed on Tuesday, were “clearly an orchestrated and foxy move by the [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi-Captain duo to completely destroy the farmers’ cause by throwing the responsibility for purchase of crops up in the air between the State and the Centre”.

‘Farmers betrayed’

Mr. Majithia said that the Assembly session had been convened with only two objectives and on both, the farmers had been stabbed in the back.

AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann said the State government Bills were not enough to safeguard the interests of farmers and the only way forward was that it should enact its own law guaranteeing the purchase of all crops, including wheat and paddy, at minimum support price.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fpuj4i/article32912755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE21-AMARINDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cm-hits-back-after-oppn-u-turn-on-punjab-bills/article32912756.ece

While issuing the direction on Tuesday, Justices Sheel Nagu and Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava restrained District Magistrates of nine districts under the jurisdiction of the Bench from permitting any political party/candidate to organise physical congregations unless they satisfied the DM that virtual campaigns were not possible.

The decision of the DM permitting any political party to conduct physical congregation should become effective only after the EC approved it in writing, the court said, while hearing a petition filed by Gwalior-based lawyer Ashish Pratap Singh.

Even if the permission was granted, the Justices added, congregations could be organised only after the political party/candidate concerned “deposits money with the DM sufficient to purchase double the number of masks and sanitisers required for protecting and sanitising the number of persons expected.”

Candidates are also required to file an undertaking that they would be personally liable to distribute masks and sanitisers to members of a congregation before it started. Instances pointed out in the last 15 days gave “a clear indication” that functionaries, members of political parties or the person at the helm were taking no steps to avoid physical congregation, the court noted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/file-cases-against-leaders-for-violating-covid-19-norms/article32912677.ece

251,2020/10/22,Freelance scribe granted bail by Allahabad HC,"He was arrested for posting fake tweet

Freelance journalist Prashant Kanojia, who was arrested by the Lucknow police for allegedly posting a fake tweet, was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court, his wife said on Wednesday.

“Prashant has secured bail from the High Court,” said his wife Jagisha Arora. “My faith in the judiciary and Baba Saheb’s [B.R. Ambedkar] constitution has paid off,” she said on Twitter.

Mr. Kanojia was arrested in August for allegedly posting on Twitter a tweet purportedly about Dalits, tribals and Backward Castes people being barred from entering the Ram Mandir. He was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police from his Delhi residence.

According to an FIR registered at the Hazratganj police station here, Mr. Kanojia was accused of posting on Twitter the screenshot of a post attributed to Sushil Tiwari, a member of a little known fringe group Hindu Army. In the post, Mr. Kanojia allegedly made a sarcastic remark about barring entry to the Ram Mandir for OBC, SC and ST communities.

252,2020/10/22,"Give FIR copy to Umar Khalid, court tells Delhi Police","‘No person shall be held in custody without being informed of reasons for arrest’

A court here ordered Delhi Police to supply former JNU student leader Umar Khalid a copy of the FIR, remand application and remand order of the case related to the north-east Delhi riots in which he was arrested.

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Purshotam Pathak noted that it was a settled proposition of law that no person shall be detained in custody without being informed of the grounds for such arrest.

The court said that the remand application, the remand order and medical reports of his examination conducted during police custody “does not contain any material which may not be disclosed due to sensitivity of the matter or for any other reason”.

It also highlighted that the chargesheet in the case has already been filed.

Mr. Khalid in his plea, seeking the documents, said he was arrested in an FIR registered at Crime Branch on September 14, and remanded to police custody for 10 days. Thereafter, he has been remanded to judicial custody till October 22.

Requests were ignored

During the judicial custody period, Mr. Khalid was arrested again in an FIR registered at Khajuri Khas police station, which is being investigated by the Crime Branch. He stated that during the course of the remand proceedings, he made categorical requests to the duty magistrate at Tihar jail for the presence of his lawyer.

However, the request was not entertained, he said.

On the other hand, special public prosecutor vehemently opposed Mr. Khalid’s plea saying that there was no provision in CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) to supply the documents before taking cognisance by the court.

The SPP further submitted that if the documents are supplied to Mr. Khalid at this stage, it will open a Pandora box and he will be moving a number of applications for supplying one or the other document.

The court, however, rejected this contention saying, “An accused must be informed of the bare necessary facts leading to his arrest, such as the grounds and the reasons, and the facts that in respect of whom and by whom the offence is said to have been committed as well as the time and the place of offences etc”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ihq09z/article32912513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21DELPRIYAUMARKHALID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/give-fir-copy-to-umar-khalid-court-tells-delhi-police/article32912514.ece
253,2020/10/22,Shakti and Mukti Mohan on celebrating dance amid uncertain times in new reality show,"Dancers and sister-duo Shakti and Mukti Mohan talk about celebrating dance as first-time collaborators ahead of their new reality show, Zee Cafe’s ‘Dance With Me’

Even on a Zoom call, the camaraderie is unmissable: Shakti and Mukti Mohan, the dancer/actor/sister-duo, is actively looking for chances to poke fun at each other. While Shakti exudes a formal energy (characteristic of an older sibling in the presence of a younger one), Mukti is all smiles. In fact, the latter is known for her wicked abilities to be eternally cheerful, says Shakti.

It is this effortless dynamic, sans filters, that they wish to bring to Zee Cafe’s new reality show Dance With Me, as co-hosts. An interactive show, Dance With Me will invite entries from viewers (in the form of videos) which will be reviewed by the Mohan sisters, who will also take the audience through a ‘hook step’ every week. Former Dance India Dance episodes will also be featured. And, in between all the reviewing and teaching, there will be a whole lot of “sisterly banter”, Shakti and Mukti assure amid laughs, from their Mumbai home.

Being products of Television and reality shows, both Shakti and Mukti are not unfamiliar with the medium or format. In fact, through the locked-down months, Mukti had come up with her own YouTube videos under the moniker Mukti Manch, while Shakti was busy with a video series called ‘Dance About It’ where she discussed life in lockdown and her trials to cope through dance, as a form of expression.

Dance With Me, is however, different.“Using this platform to talk about experienced and new dancers, dance forms and judges; is a huge responsibility but at the same time a lot of fun because it has ‘us’ together,” says Mukti, for whom having Shakti onboard, right beside her, is an experience in itself — she has always looked up to her elder sister as an artiste.

“We want the viewers to celebrate everything in and around dance, right from costumes to props and expressions. and how important they are to a dancer,” she says. The idea is to create a community of and for dancers. Together, they had also founded Nritya Tribe, a platform that explored the duo’s classical and folk influences from childhood.

In its purest form

The relaxed format of Dance With Me works for the times we are in. “As a result of the pandemic, I feel that dancers have got the chance to stop the race and introspect why they started dancing in the first place. When you sit back and think, you end up creating more,” says Shakti. “Dance is in its purest state now; which is also something we want to celebrate in the show.”

And, reality shows provide the platform: which, according to Shakti, is all the more important now, when artists all over are experiencing a slump. “They can draw from the energy that a platform like this gives and create more.”

The most prominent criticism that reality TV has had to face is perhaps that the fame or recognition received is short-lived. Shakti, however, feels that fame is something that cannot be controlled. “Fame comes, money comes..it sometimes may not. But that’s not the fault of the platform, stage or the talent.” Mukti quips in, “I feel that we shouldn’t bother about the things that are really not in our control. An artiste is always asked ‘what, next?’ But, right now, it is the time to introspect and rewind.”

Dance With Me will be aired every Sunday starting October 25, at 10 pm on Zee Cafe and 10 am on Zee TV",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/1xydp8/article32917418.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MOHANS2200RGB-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/shakti-mohan-and-mukti-mohan-on-new-dance-reality-show/article32917419.ece
254,2020/10/22,Epics retold through a blend of art forms,"Sonal Mansingh’s ‘Kala Yatra’ brought alive episodes through narration and performance

The universal appeal and relevance of our epics are what inspire artistes to revisit them.

Sonal Mansingh’s two-day ‘Kala Yatra 2020’, a virtual presentation, was a blend of performances, talks, paintings and puppet shows.

The festival began with Kalakshetra’s ‘Sita Swayamvaram’. The presentation lacked vibrancy, perhaps it was an old recording.

Choodamani Nandagopal’s talk on the ‘Abduction of Sita’ followed by the depiction of Rama’s exile through a puppet show made for a seamless flow of episodes. Choodamani explained how the Ramayana lends itself beautifully to diverse art forms. The navarasas find perfect expression in the epic.

Referring to the maiming of Shoorpanaka evoking laughter in Sita and Lakshman, Choodmani said it was difficult for 21st century minds to laugh over an instance of a woman getting maimed, no matter how wicked she is. Her lengthy talk, though very informative, could have been made more interesting with pictures.

Aesthetic presentation

The Dramatic Arts college of the Thailand-based Bundit Pattana Silpa Institute depicted the Swarn Mrig (golden deer) scene. It was replete with aesthetic movements and mime. The costumes, particularly the headgear, caught the eye. The Mareech dance was well choreographed. The presentation proved how the Ramayana is popular across South East Asia, with each region adding its own flavour to the epic.

Prasoon Joshi’s elucidative talk in chaste Hindi on the character of Jambavant, who spanned across three yugas, bridged the abduction episode with the quest for Sita and the ensuing battle with Ravana where Jambavant plays a pivotal role in igniting (as a motivational speaker) Hanuman’s prowess.

Joshi stressed on the conversation between human (Ram and Lakshman) and non-human (Jambavant and Sugreev) as indicative of interactions at higher levels of consciousness. Another puppet show showed ‘Lanka dahan’ (Lanka on fire).

The curtains came down with ‘Sankatmochan Hanumanashtak,’ a group presentation by the students of Delhi-based Shri Kamakhya Kalapeeth, depicting the life of Hanuman, his companions Bali, Sugreev, Jambavant, his search for Sita, and his innate devotion to Lord Rama. Sadly, occasional disturbances marred the visual appeal of the presentation.

Next on Mahabharata

With its wide range of characters, the episodes from the Mahabharata on day two made for a lively offering. Dr. Bharat Gupt threw light on the incidents that led to ‘Bhishma Pratignya’ (Vow of Bhishma).

The professor maintained that Bhishma was a flawless character and if there were faults, it was in his father Shantanu and the social milieu of the times. The comparison of Bhishma with a Greek tragic hero was interesting.

It was followed by a riveting solo by Sonal Mansingh. For those of us who have not seen her on stage recently, it gave a glimpse of her artistry, especially her abhinaya. The multi-layered character of Draupadi — from a proud princess of Panchal to a morally wounded woman who loses everything — was explored with finesse. Her fiery spirit was brought to the fore with conviction. The back and forth technique and the use of fabric as a metaphor were commendable. Sonal’s dance was an eclectic mix of Odissi, Bharatanatyam and contemporary.

Focus on Karna

‘Karna Vadh’ by Rasa United (Delhi), that brought together Chhau, Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam, had ace dancer S. Vasudevan in the lead. He conveyed the pathos of Karna through an effective narrative.

Dr. Sahana Singh spoke about the Mahabharata and education, with examples of learning centres that had thrived in that era.

The battle of Kurukshetra and its aftermath were well portrayed through Nangiar Koothu, and the dancers of Natanakairali showcased ‘Urubhangam’. Balarama, Duryodhana and Gandhari were played in front of a huge brass lamp, the light accentuating gestures, eye movements and expressions. Even the goriest scenes were played with such subtlety that they lingered long after the show was over.

G. Shanmuga Sundaram, Deputy Inspector General of police, Prisons, (Coimbatore range), told The Hindu on Thursday that new remand and convict prisoners were admitted to Coimbatore Central Prison by following various safety measures.

“New prisoners are lodged in separate facilities in sub-jails for 14 days before shifting them to the Central Prison. They will be quarantined in a separate facility in the Prison for another 14 days before shifting to main blocks,” he said.

Prison authorities check whether a new remand prisoner was subjected to COVID-19 test during the medical examination conducted by the police as part of the remand procedure. The test results come while they undergo the quarantine in sub-jails.

Headmistress Ayyammal (55) and her husband Thangavelu (56), a retired employee of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, were arrested and remanded on Wednesday.

As the girl continued to insist on a change of school, the parents asked her for the reason and she disclosed to them the ordeal she had been through.

She told her parents that Thangavelu, who used to spend time at the school when he comes to drop and pick his wife, sexually assaulted her in an isolated place on the school premises in March, said the police.

The Mi mobile phones, said to be worth ₹15 crore, were stolen by gang suspected to be from Madhya Pradesh that had carried out similar attacks elsewhere.

The consignment that originated from Sriperampudur Industrial Estate was crossing Shoolagiri here, when the truck was reportedly stopped on the highway at about 2 a.m. The drivers, Arun (26) and Kumar (29), were attacked and tied up by the gang. The consignment that included 15 cartons of 960 mobile phones each and a few more mobile phones were shifted to another vehicle. The gang fled the spot with the consignment. The drivers found help from the highway patrol, who alerted the district police.

Totally, 14,500 mobile phones are suspected to have been stolen, though the police are still awaiting a formal complaint from the company as of Wednesday evening. The container vehicle that belonged to DHL courier was retrieved from the spot.

Superintendent of Police Bandi Gangadhar told The Hindu that the truck was stopped by the gang that was believed to have followed the consignment from the point of origin. “The same modus operandi was followed in Nellore, Chittoor, Guntur and Warangal districts of Andhra Pradesh, where a gang would follow the vehicle and intercept it at a desolate spot. We are yet to receive a complaint from the company, and we have the accounts of the drivers. The courier company’s vehicle is, however, intact,” Mr.Gangadhar said.

Earlier, Deputy Inspector General of Police Pradip Kumar and Mr. Gangadhar visited the spot.

Truck jacking incidents have occurred on the same stretch of the highway earlier. In 2015, a consignment carrying aluminium worth several crores was stolen and the driver was brutally murdered, sparking an inter-State strike by truckers demanding protection.

273,2020/10/22,Motor room at tribal settlement lying in disuse for 17 years without power,"Talamalai Panchayat had constructed the tank and motor room at a cost of ₹10 lakh in 2003

An overhead water tank and a motor room that were constructed 17 years ago at Ramaranai tribal settlement in Talamalai Panchayat were lying idle in all these years as the settlement is yet to get power connection.

Located one km. away from Talamalai – Dhimbam forest road, the settlement is nested inside the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) where 20 families comprising 90 members were residing. “We were using kerosene lamps during night hours in all these years”, said Almadhan (72), the senior most person in the settlement, who first saw electric bulbs lighted up in the settlement when automatic solar lighting systems were installed in 2018. But the system helps in lighting only two bulbs in each house and all electronic gadgets like television and radios were lying idle, he added.

The panchayat had in 2003-04 constructed the tank and a motor room at a cost of ₹ 10 lakh. However, in the absence of power connection to the settlement, the tank and the motor room, remain unused. People said that they had deposited money for electricity connection in 2003, but later, the electricity board had returned their money claiming that the forest department had refused permission for installing electric poles and giving power connection,” said K. Raman of the settlement.

A hand-pump helps them to draw water and fulfil their needs, which people say is inadequate.

The hamlet has no anganwadi centre and children are directly admitted to the school-cum-hostel at Talamalai which is located five km away.

“We have to walk for one km. to reach the bus stop and board the bus to Talamalai which is difficult for the children”, said K. Ramesh, who wanted a tar-topped road, anganwadi centre and power connection to the village.

Recently, Tangedco officials had submitted a proposal to the forest department for installing electric poles from Talamalai to the settlement while the details for giving house service connections are yet to be submitted.

Sources in the Forest Department said that if the required land for the project is less than one hectare, District Forest Officer, Hasanur Division, can give permission, while if it is more than one hectare, permission has to be obtained from the National Tiger Conservation Authority.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/2a8itg/article32912366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB21WATERTANK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/motor-room-at-tribal-settlement-lying-in-disuse-for-17-years-without-power/article32912367.ece

278,2020/10/22,We are hungry to win: Rabada,"A lot of credit for Delhi Capitals’ stay at the top of the points table is being attributed to Purple Cap holder Kagiso Rabada. But he was quick to point out several other performers responsible for the team’s impressive showing.

Rabada, during Thursday’s press conference, backed his response with facts. “We’ve seven players who’ve won (eight) Man-of-the-Match awards… there are match-winners galore. It shows all of us are hungry to win. Every bowler has bowled well. It is just that I happen to have the purple cap. That’s it!”

The team’s award winners so far are Shikhar Dhawan (twice), Anrich Nortje, R. Ashwin, Axar Patel, Shreyas Iyer, Prithvi Shaw and Marcus Stoinis.

He praised Nortje for his impressive efforts. “He’s bowling really well. He has a lot of pace. He’s always willing to learn and open to new ideas, and I think that’s a great trait to have. Anrich and I are always giving our best for our team.”

About the conditions in the UAE, Rabada said: “I feel there is seam movement sometimes. But all the pitches have definitely slowed down, so it’s pretty similar to India, but it’s a different kind of slow. I feel the conditions in the UAE have something for everyone.”

Liberal environment

He was lavish in his praise of skipper Shreyas. “Shreyas has been really unbelievable. Leading overseas players on a big stage is a huge task. Shreyas is a just a normal guy who is chilled out. When we get on to the field, he is a captain who has to make decisions. I am sure Ricky (Ponting) is helping him. Shreyas has many tools around him, and he has used them well so far.

“It’s a very liberal environment in our team — not a dictatorship — which is one of the reasons we’ve been really successful.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tyg2bd/article32921714.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23RABADA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/we-are-hungry-to-win-rabada/article32921715.ece
279,2020/10/22,"India’s Australia tour green-lit, set to begin with Sydney ODI","BCCI wants CA to allow players’ families to travel

Having obtained the requisite government clearances, Cricket Australia (CA) has shared the provisional itinerary of India’s forthcoming tour with the BCCI.

Unless the “teething issues” raised by the BCCI result in a stand-off, the tour is set to begin with the first ODI in Sydney on November 27 and culminate with the fourth Test in Brisbane from January 15 next year.

While the BCCI is yet to confirm the itinerary, The Hindu understands that it has no problems with the schedule.

The impending issues, as confirmed by a BCCI insider, have more to do with the size of the touring entourage and whether the players’ families will be allowed to travel with them.

“CA has advised families of players to be barred from travelling, considering the sensitivity and sanctity of the bio-bubble. But given the prolonged duration of the bubble the players will remain in, it would be in their interest if the families can be with them in Australia, at least for some time. Hopefully, the issue will be sorted out soon,” revealed the BCCI insider.

Despite the itinerary not formally being made public, the Test specialists, along with the coaching and support staff, are set to arrive in Dubai by Sunday. Once they complete their quarantine, they can train together before the touring party departs for Sydney from Dubai after the IPL final on November 10.

It is also learnt that the Indian team management has requested the BCCI for a psychologist and motivational trainer in Australia to better handle the challenges of living in the bio-bubble.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/eejn5f/article25108229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKETAUSTRALIAKB1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indias-australia-tour-green-lit-set-to-begin-with-sydney-odi/article32921507.ece
280,2020/10/22,"Indian Premier League 2020, RR vs SRH | Pandey’s masterclass helps Sunrisers flatten Royals","His sensational 83 n.o. is complemented by Vijay Shankar and Holder’s efforts; Rajasthan batsmen manage below-par 154

On his day, Manish Pandey can be devastating with a bat in his hands. Rajasthan Royals was at the receiving end of his beautiful onslaught at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday.

Chasing what looked like an under-par target of 155, his unbeaten 83 (47b, 4x4, 8x6) helped Sunrisers Hyderabad post an eight-wicket win after three straight defeats. His 140-run stand for the unbroken third wicket with Vijay Shankar (52 not out, 51b, 6x4) ensured RR had little chance after Jofra Archer had made early inroads.

David Warner's men, with eight points, have now caught up with RR and KXIP, as the battle for a place in the playoffs hots up in the lower half of the table.

Warner, Archer’s bunny

The chase had begun disastrously, though, as Archer extended his stranglehold over Warner, removing him with the fourth ball of the innings.

The delivery moved away to take the outside edge and Ben Stokes justified Steve Smith's decision to have a second slip with a diving catch. It was the sixth time in the last seven innings that Archer had dismissed the Australian.

Archer dealt another severe blow in his next over, this time with a ball that came back in sharply, at 149kmph. It was too good for Jonny Bairstow, who was bowled through the gate.

This meant SRH’s two most successful batsmen, both with over 300 runs in the tournament, were back in the dugout inside the third over, with the score on 16. It also meant that Pandey had an opportunity to showcase his talent. He stroked the ball well from the beginning, hitting two boundaries off Kartik Tyagi.

In the following over, he smashed two sixes off Ben Stokes, including one with a stunning flick over square-leg. Pandey timed his shots well and paced his innings wonderfully. At the other end, Vijay Shankar was growing in confidence too. By the time Archer was brought back after his two-over burst, it was too late. He was even hit for three successive fours by Vijay Shankar.

Earlier, RR struggled after being put in. None of the batsmen were able to convert their starts against tight bowling, especially by Rashid Khan. Stokes (30, 32b, 2x4) and Sanju Samson (36, 26b, 3x4, 1x6) put on 56 for the second wicket before it was broken by Jason Holder, who made his first IPL match in four years count by taking three wickets.

281,2020/10/22,ICC to consider splitting points for WTC matches affected by COVID-19 pandemic: Report,"The matter is likely to come up for discussion at its Cricket Committee meeting next month.

Aiming to complete the World Test Championship cycle and host the final in June as per schedule, the ICC is contemplating splitting points for all those WTC bilateral series that had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

The matter is likely to come up for discussion at its Cricket Committee meeting next month, ESPNCricinfo has reported.

According to the website, while one of the options is splitting points, the other feasible option could be considering the points for only those matches that will actually be played by the end of March, 2021.

Based on those matches till March, the final positions on the points table could be computed based on the percentage of points the teams have won from the matches that they’ve contested.

As of now, each series carries 120 points and depending on the number of matches, two, three, four or five, the points are distributed.

For a two-Test series, winner gets 60 per match and 30 for a draw. For a three-match series, it is 40 and 20 for win and draw. For a four-match rubber, it is 30 and 15 while for a maximum of five-game event, it would be 24 and 12 points.

“A significant number of Tests have been postponed this year because of the pandemic. In many cases, it isn’t clear when they might be rescheduled to, let alone whether they can be squeezed in within this WTC league cycle, which concludes at the end of March 2021,” the website reported.

The points split system that they are mulling will be distributing one third of the total points for the postponed series.

“Splitting the points would be within the regulations as they stand, whereby all Tests in the cycle that can’t be played (through no fault of either side) are deemed draws. In that scenario, both sides receive a third of the points available for a Test (120 points are available for every series). Basing it on percentages of points played for would require a tweak to existing regulations,” the website wrote.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/f0i9fr/article32918050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ICC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-to-consider-splitting-points-for-wtc-matches-affected-by-covid-19-pandemic-report/article32918051.ece
282,2020/10/22,"Indian Premier League 2020 | Struggling for survival, Chennai faces fierce rivals Mumbai","CSK can still get to 14 points if they win their remaining four games, giving them an outside chance of making the play-offs.

Their campaign turning from bad to worse, Chennai Super Kings are expected to try out a few of their younger players when they take on defending champions Mumbai Indians in an IPL match here on Friday.

Though skipper M S Dhoni conceded after the loss against Rajasthan Royals that the season might be already over them, CSK can still get to 14 points if they win their remaining four games, giving them an outside chance of making the play-offs.

As head coach Stephen Fleming pointed out, the ageing squad may have finally “run out of juice” after doing well over the past two seasons when they won in 2018 and reached the final the following year.

Things have gone pear-shaped for CSK since their win over MI in the tournament opener on November 19.

The team received a hammering at the hands of Rajasthan Royals and would be without the services of the injured Dwayne Bravo, who is out of the tournament.

The Super Kings batsmen struggled against Rajasthan Royals and it remains to be seen if the untested players in the side get their chance as indicated by Dhoni after the drubbing on Monday.

Dhoni himself has not been at his best along with the others barring Faf du Plessis. The team’s persistence with a struggling Kedar Jadhav has come in for a lot of flak and it needs to be seen if he makes way for either N Jagadeesan or Ruturaj Gaikwad.

However, they would be up against a formidable MI side which won five games in a row before Kings XI Punjab halted the juggernaut, turning the tables in a double Super Over on Sunday night.

The four-time IPL champions have been in ominous form and the varied bowling attack could prove a challenge for the CSK batters, who are low on confidence.

At Sharjah, which was a tough venue for bowlers to start with, things seem to have changed with the wicket slowing down and sort of evened out things.

Also, the MI batting line-up has been in good nick with Quinton de Kock in splendid form while Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan have had their moments.

That’s not all, the power-hitting abilities of Kieron Pollard and Hardik Pandya have rescued MI when the big guns have not fired. Krunal Pandya has underlined his utility with some crucial cameos and tight spells in tandem with leggie Rahul Chahar.

The Mumbai bowling unit has been doing well but the think-tank may consider bringing in James Pattinson for Nathan Coulter-Nile, who has proved expensive.

A well-rounded and consistent Mumbai Indians unit could provide a huge challenge for an under-fire CSK battling to salvage some pride.

Two points on Friday match would take Rohit Sharma’s men closer to sealing a play-offs berth while the Super Kings, who are theoretically still in with a chance, would aim to finish strongly in what has been a nightmare of a season so far.

Teams:

Chennai Super Kings: MS Dhoni (C), M Vijay, Ambati Rayudu, Faf du Plessis, Shane Watson, Kedar Jadhav, Ravindra Jadeja, Lungi Ngidi, Deepak Chahar, Piyush Chawla, Imran Tahir, Mitchell Santner, Josh Hazlewood, Shardul Thakur, Sam Curran, N Jagadeesan, KM Asif, Monu Kumar, R Sai Kishore, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Karn Sharma.

Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma (Captain), Aditya Tare, Anmolpreet Singh, Anukul Roy, Chris Lynn, Dhawal Kulkarni, Digvijay Deshmukh, Hardik Pandya, Ishan Kishan, James Pattison, Jasprit Bumrah, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Mitchell McClenaghan, Mohsin Khan, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Prince Balwant Rai, Quinton De Kock, Rahul Chahar, Saurabh Tiwary, Sherfane Rutherford, Suryakumar Yadav, Trent Boult.

283,2020/10/22,"Cricketers from west more likely to have mental health issues, says Misbah on playing in bio-bubble","The almost two-month long IPL is also being held in a protected environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Karachi Pakistan head coach and former captain Misbah-ul-Haq believes that players from “western countries” are more likely to be hit by mental health issues if cricket is continued to be played in a strict bio-secure environment.

Pakistan themselves played in a bio-bubble created for their England tour in August.

Also read: Watch | Decoding the bio-bubble at IPL 2020

The almost two-month long IPL is also being held in a protected environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Yes it is an issue about players and team officials facing mental health issues if cricket continues to be played like it is being held right now. As far as Pakistan is concerned I think our players due to their social environment are mentally very strong so they can get through this period.

Also read: Extended bio bubbles can cause ‘extreme burnout’, warn Morgan and Holder

“But yes I believe in the long run, players and officials from western countries could be facing more such problems because their culture is different from ours, Misbah said in an interview to the Cricket Baaz channel on You Tube.

He noted that in Pakistani culture socialising was done differently but in western countries people were used to going out.

“For them I think this existing Covid-19 environment that has been created to ensure cricket is played is more of a challenge,” he added.

Also read: Hosting England on our grounds ‘foremost priority’, says Sourav Ganguly

He said the restricted and isolated conditions on the England tour were difficult for the players but from a cricket point of view it also helped the Pakistani players and officials a lot.

“I think it was good for us because communication improved between management and players, the players were supporting each other a lot and generally the bonding in the team improved a lot.”

Also read: IPL | Team now more acceptive of bio-bubble, empty stands won’t lead to drop in intensity: Kohli

But Misbah said the sooner things normalised the better because if the Covid-19 threat continued for more months, it would create uncertainty as to how big events would be played and in what environment.

“Staying indoors all the time, movement being restricted and not being able to go out with freedom do take a toll on the players and even officials.”

He also made it clear that while he had decided to step down as chief selector for a number of reasons, he had every intention of completing his three-year tenure as head coach.

“I have completed one year in the job and there are a lot of things to be positive about.

“There has been development and progress in the team and more importantly I can say with confidence that the mindset and approach of the players to white ball cricket has changed for the better.

Misbah said that what satisfied him was the same mind set and approach was also visible among domestic players in the recent National T20 Championship.

To a question, he conceded that Pakistan is following England’s path in preparing for the coming World Cups with a changed mindset and increasing the pool of players available to play for Pakistan.

“Yes I think we are on that path the talent we have now and it is increasing. I can safely say that by early next year after the Pakistan Super League we will have a pool of players who can serve us well in the three World Cups in 2021, 22 and 23.”

On his decision to step down as chief selector, Misbah insisted it was his own decision as he wanted to focus more on coaching.

“Secondly I had discussed with the PCB I will review both my positions after a year and take it from there. I want to now totally focus on coaching, he said.

Misbah reiterated the PCB did not force him to step down as chief selector.

When pressed he did concede that one more factor that influenced his decision was that it was not easy being with players and trying to extract performances from them in dual roles.

“At times it becomes difficult because after all as a head coach one has to get performances from the players.”

Misbah also rubbished conspiracy theories about wanting to prematurely end the career of former captain and wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed who has been dropped for the home series against Zimbabwe.

“Why would I want to do that? What do I have against him. If we wanted to end his career we would not have given him a central contract and just told him to go and play domestic cricket and try to come back.

“But we realised that even though Muhammad Rizwan is performing exceptionally well but we still don’t have a back-up or replacement who we can count on for experience and performances.

“Remember we need a proper back up or all three formats even now.”

Misbah said he himself had had one to one discussions with Sarfaraz and emphasised that he remained a top player and he just needed to pick himself up and one good innings can turn things around for him.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/3gf8j7/article32915449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MISBAH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cricketers-from-west-more-likely-to-have-mental-health-issues-says-misbah-on-playing-in-bio-bubble/article32915450.ece
284,2020/10/22,IPL 2020 | Destiny still in our hands: McCullum,"McCullum believes KKR can go all the way to the final, despite just hanging on to the fourth spot in the eight-team competition.

Kolkata Knight Riders coach Brendon McCullum said his batsmen were “timid” in their approach and “lacked intent,” which led to the team’s humiliating eight-wicket loss to Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League at Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.

KKR top order failed miserably as the side managed 84 for eight following RCB seamer Mohammed Siraj’s early three-wicket burst.

“I didn't think there was a lot in the pitch. Siraj bowled well and (Chris) Morris at times. But we were just a little timid in our approach,” McCullum said at the post-match press conference.

“That’s frustrating…Before the match we talked about wanting to show some strong intent with our batting…tonight we probably lacked that intent.

“Siraj bowled excellent lines and lengths. He was out to present the seam and ask a few questions of us, questions which were answered better than we did tonight.”

The New Zealander, who was known for his dominating batting, said, “There are many things you can do. You can use your crease laterally, advance or go deeper into your crease. You can try and apply a little bit of pressure somehow.”

McCullum cited the example of RCB opener Aaron Finch – who showed intent during his knock of 16 off 21 balls – and expected his batsmen, who “learnt good lessons,” to be creative.

McCullum said the team must keep its morale high. “We are still fourth which is very fortunate for us. Destiny is still in our hands and we’ve got to tidy up some of the areas.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/iuhvi6/article32915222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KKR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-loss-against-rcb-was-morale-crushing-but-destiny-still-in-our-hands-says-mccullum/article32915223.ece
285,2020/10/22,"IPL 2020 | Virat handing new ball to me boosted confidence, says Siraj on “magical” performance","Siraj’s first three wickets came without conceding a run as he became the first bowler in IPL history to bowl two maidens in a single game.

Royal Challengers Bangalore pacer Mohammed Siraj, who ripped through Kolkata Knight Riders’ top-order with a “magical performance”, said skipper Virat Kohli’s surprise decision to hand him the new ball lifted his confidence in the IPL match here.

Siraj’s first three wickets came without conceding a run as he became the first bowler in IPL history to bowl two maidens in a single game. RCB restricted KKR to a paltry 84/8 and chased down the target in 13.3 overs.

Once Chris Morris generated swing early on, Siraj was asked to bowl the second over following a discussion with wicketkeeper AB de Villiers.

“We hadn’t planned that I would open but when we went out, Virat bhai said ‘Miyan, ready ho jao (Sir, get ready!), you will have to bowl...’ It boosted my confidence,” the Hyderabadi pacer, who returned with figures of 4-2-8-3, said after the eight-wicket win on Wednesday.

“Morris beat the batsmen (in the first over) and then Virat bhai spoke to AB de Villiers (behind the stumps) and gave me the bowl,” he added.

“Initially, I didn’t think it would swing so much after seeing the wicket. I just backed my strength and really enjoyed a lot.”

Brought in the second over, Siraj struck in his third ball with a good length ball that went away of Rahul Tripathi.

In his next delivery, he cleaned up Nitish Rana, with a ball that sharply cut back in and breached the left-hander’s defence. In the next over, he accounted for Tom Banton with another outswing delivery.

His bowling figures became the most economical this season.

A natural in-swing bowler, Siraj has been practising with the new ball and generating outswing in the practice sessions.

“I’ve been a natural inswing bowler but while practising I have started bowling outswing a lot better.

“In our practise sessions, we have Devdutt Padikkal and Parthiv Patel. I bowl the same length to them which I bowled to Nitish Rana. I did the same thing in the game and was able to execute it well,” he said.

Having endured a tough outing against the same side in 2019, it’s now a story of going from being zero to hero for Siraj.

Siraj was hammered for 36 runs in 2.2 overs before being removed from the attack for bowling two beamers as KKR chased down 206 with five balls to spare in their IPL 2019 match.

In the same game, Siraj had also dropped a sitter from Chris Lynn and faced a lot a criticism.

Often sidelined in presence of Chris Morris, Navdeep Saini and the spin duo of Yuzvendra Chahal and Washington Sundar, Siraj got his fourth match on Wednesday when he was included in place of Shahbaz Ahmed.

“I’ve always had a lot of support from the RCB setup. All I wanted to do this year was give a magical performance. I wanted to do something different this year,” Siraj, who played his fourth match of the season, said.

“Whenever I used to think about my performance in the IPL, I had made up my mind that I would deliver a performance to remember. It’s about doing something different, something magical,” he concluded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/paacof/article32915130.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SIRAJ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-virat-handing-new-ball-to-me-boosted-confidence-says-siraj-on-magical-performance/article32915131.ece

Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with north-east Delhi riots in February, told a court here on Thursday that he was not allowed to step out of his cell and it was sort of a “solitary confinement”.

Also read: Give FIR copy to Umar Khalid, court tells Delhi Police

Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat directed Tihar Jail Superintendent to be present before the court on Friday to hear the matter.

Mr. Khalid made his submissions directly to the court through video conferencing when he was produced before it on expiry of his judicial custody in the case.

The court also pulled up the Assistant Jail Superintendent of Tihar prisons for not unmuting the microphone when Mr. Khalid told him that he wanted to speak to the judge.

Mr. Khalid said the official told him the microphone will be unmuted if the judge gave the permission for it.

If an undertrial wants to say something, then unmute and let him speak or you tell us that he wants to say something, the judge told the jail official.

Mr. Khalid alleged that he was alone in his cell and not allowed to step out of his cell or talk to anyone.

I have not been allowed to step outside at all. I am alone in my cell. No one is allowed to meet me. It is practically sort of a solitary confinement. I am not well for the last three days. I am feeling discomfort. This is like a punishment. Why am I given this punishment? I reiterate that I need security but it cannot be that I have to be in my cell all day, he claimed.

He further said that on Wednesday he was shown an order passed by Additional Superintendent Pradeep Sharma of Jail number 2, in which it was stated that Mr. Khalid should not be allowed out of his cell for 24 hours a day.

“I request a recall of that order. In the morning, the Jail Superintendent came and asked the jail staff to allow me to go outside. I was allowed to step out for 10 minutes and then after he left, I was not allowed to go outside since then,” Mr. Khalid alleged.

When his counsel, advocate Trideep Pais, told the court that no adverse steps should be taken against him by the jail authorities for putting forward his grievances, the judge said, “Mr. Khalid should not be punished for putting forward his grievances. You should take care of it.”

The court had on October 17 directed the Tihar Jail Superintendent to provide adequate and security in judicial custody.

The directions came on an application filed by Mr. Khalid seeking adequate security in prison so that he was not harmed by anyone in judicial custody.

289,2020/10/22,Northeast Delhi riots: court denies bail to former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain,"It says he used his ‘muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration’.

A Delhi court on Thursday denied bail to former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain in three different FIRs related to the northeast Delhi riots, noting that he used his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration.

Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said that the public witnesses against Mr. Hussain were residents of the same locality and if released on bail at this stage, the possibility of him threatening or intimidating them could not be ruled out.

The court also rejected Mr. Hussain’s contention that he be treated at parity with other co-accused persons in the cases who had been enlarged on bail. It said that the role assigned to Mr. Hussain in the cases was totally different and distinct from the rest of the co-accused, as he was the “main kingpin/conspirator in the case”.

The judge noted that at the time of the eruption of the communal riots, Mr. Hussain had been in a powerful position (sitting AAP Councillor of the area).

‘No cogent evidence’

Mr. Hussain, who had been in judicial custody since March 16, argued that there was no cogent and legal evidence which was admissible in the eyes of law to connect him with the incident alleged in the cases.

“There is no evidence by way of even a single video footage or CCTV footage to prove that the applicant (Hussain) had participated in the riots or caused damage to any property,” he argued.

‘Victim of circumstances’

Mr. Hussain said he belonged to ‘Aam Aadmi Party’ and was a ‘victim of circumstances’, as he had been caught up in a political cross-fire, and the allegations levelled against him were nothing but a political blame game to malign his image.

He also contended that the primary witness had initially not named him in his complaint but inculpated him only while recording of his statement by the investigating agency. This, he said, was nothing but merely an “improvement” done at the instance of the investigating agency.

“Even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to the applicant, he cannot shy away from his liability under the provisions of the Sections invoked against him, particularly on account of the fact that his house/building became the hub/centre point for the rioters and rabble-rousers to unleash the worst communal riots since Partition in Delhi,” the court said.

The judge stated that he found “ocular evidence” of independent witnesses to be categorical, which gave the clear details qua the active role played by him in the incidents in question.

The Call Detail Record analysis of Mr. Hussain’s mobile number confirmed his presence at or around the scene of crimes on the dates of incidents, the court said. It also rejected his contention on the delay in the recording of statements of witnesses by the investigating agency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ai64jd/article32881458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TAHIRHUSSAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/northeast-delhi-riots-court-denies-bail-to-former-aap-councillor-tahir-hussain/article32916795.ece
290,2020/10/22,Delhi’s AQI inches close to ‘very poor’ category,"Air was slightly better in Gurugram, but very poor in Noida

The air quality of Delhi inched closer to the ‘very poor’ category on Thursday while Noida’s slipped to the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The air was slightly better in Gurugram, but remained in the ‘poor’ category.

Delhi’s air quality is expected to remain in the ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ category for the next two days owing to slow surface winds, as per government-run monitoring agency SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research).

“The overall Air Quality Index [AQI] of Delhi was in the ‘poor’ category as of today [Thursday] morning. Calm surface wind conditions started over the Delhi region which will lead to low ventilation, and hence deterioration of AQI is predicted. It is forecast that the air quality will be in the ‘poor’ to marginally ‘very poor’ category on October 23 and 24,” SAFAR said in a statement.

The AQI of Delhi was 296 and the values for Gurugram and Noida were 215 and 308 respectively, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin on Thursday, which is an average of the past 24 hours.

Reading at 10 p.m.

By 10 p.m., the air quality of Delhi was 321 and that of Noida was 339.

The stubble burning fire counts around Haryana, Punjab, and border regions of Delhi increased to 1,428 on Wednesday from 849 on Tuesday, as per SAFAR. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to PM2.5, a chief pollutant, in Delhi is estimated to be around 9% on Thursday.

The local wind speed is “highly” unfavourable and the wind direction in neighbouring States is favourable for a “moderate” transport of pollutants to Delhi due to stubble burning.

Campaign picks up

In a related development, Environment Minister Gopal Rai and AAP MLAs took part in the “red light on, gaadi off” campaign at Tilak Marg intersection to reduce air pollution in the city. “The campaign will be started in all the 70 legislative assemblies of Delhi from October 26.There is an appeal to the residents that they should take part in the mega campaign,” Mr. Rai said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vfd91j/article32915884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DelhiAirQualityjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhis-air-quality-remains-in-poor-category/article32915876.ece
291,2020/10/22,Punjab farmers lift blockade for goods trains till November 5,"Chief Minister welcomes move, says it is in State’s interest

Members of as many as 30 farmer unions on Wednesday announced that movement of goods trains will be allowed amid the ongoing ‘rail roko’ agitation against the Centre’s agriculture sector laws.

The decision was taken after the unions held a meeting here. “We have decided to let goods trains go till November 5. The decision has been taken in the wake of shortage of fertilizers and other agriculture-related inputs, besides the festival season,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh welcomed the decision, saying it was in the interest of the State’s economy and its revival. He said the farmers had shown their love and concern for the people of Punjab with this move, as it will allow the State to get its much-needed coal supplies. He pointed out that the State had been facing a total power shutdown as a result of coal shortage.

Capt. Amarinder said the easing of the blockade will help the State replenish its critically low urea supplies, thus catering to the urgent need of the farming community for fertilisers.

Spat over Bills

A spat broke out between the ruling Congress and the Opposition, including the Aam Aadmi Party and the Shiromani Akali Dal, on Wednesday over the three amendm-ents Bills relating to agriculture sector that were ‘unanimously’ passed by the State Assembly on Tuesday.

The Akali Dal said the Bills have thrown the farmers of the State “completely back at [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi’s mercy”. AAP termed them parallel to the three Central agriculture legislations, which were not enough to safeguard the interests of the farmers.

292,2020/10/22,Delhi Waqf Board members not paid since Feb.,"They write to Kejriwal about pending salaries

Members of the Delhi Waqf Board have written to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over non-payment of salaries for the last nine months. They said they will protest if not paid soon.

In a letter dated October 20, the members stated that they haven’t received their salaries since February “due to the sudden removal of the then Chairman of Delhi Waqf Board on 20.03.2020 and further because of the nationwide lockdown”.

The members said they made representations to the authorities concerned regarding the matter but haven’t received a response yet. “We got only verbal assurance that everything will be fine after selection of chairperson, but unfortunately the board is continuously facing hurdles in the appointment of chairperson,” the letter stated.

The members said they have been working relentlessly for the board and have also increased the revenue by approximately 182%. Due to non-payment of salaries, they are facing financial troubles and that if they’re not paid, they will be forced to protest.

“Keeping in view the above, we, the employees of Delhi Waqf Board, would like to request you to kindly intervene in this matter and take immediate action in this regard, otherwise we will have no option other than to start protest by various means,” the members said in the letter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-waqf-board-members-not-paid-since-feb/article32913015.ece
293,2020/10/22,"Air pollution now biggest health risk in India, says report","Long-term exposure contributed to over 1.67 million deaths in 2019; 1.16 lakh infants died in first month

Long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 1.67 million annual deaths from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases and neonatal diseases in India in 2019, according to the State of Global Air 2020 by the U.S.-based Health Effects Institute. Overall, air pollution was now the largest risk factor for death among all health risks, the report noted.

Outdoor and household particulate matter pollution also contributed to the deaths of more than 1,16,000 Indian infants in their first month of life last year. More than half of these deaths were associated with outdoor PM2.5 and others were linked to use of solid fuels such as charcoal, wood, and animal dung for cooking.

For the youngest infants, most deaths were related to complications from low birth weight and preterm birth.

India faced the highest per capita pollution exposure — or 83.2 μg/cubic metre — in the world, followed by Nepal at 83.1 μg/cubic metre and Niger at 80.1, according to the report which sources its data from publicly available sources. Countries with the least population exposure are below 8 micrograms (μg) per cubic metre.

Marginal decline

The government has claimed that average pollution levels in India are declining over the past three years but these have been marginal, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic plains which see extremely high particulate matter pollution especially during winter.

After a decline in pollution due to the nationwide lockdown in late March and the months-long process of reopening, pollution levels are again rising and air quality has dipped to ‘very poor’ category in several cities.

COVID-19, a disease for which people with heart and lung disease are particularly at risk of infection and death, has claimed more than 1,10,000 lives in India. Although the full links between air pollution and COVID-19 are not yet known, there is clear evidence linking air pollution and increased heart and lung disease, creating a growing concern that exposures to high levels of air pollution during winter months in South Asian countries and East Asia could worsen the effects of COVID-19.

“This newest evidence suggests an especially high risk for infants born in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa,” said HEI president Dan Greenbaum in a statement. “Although there has been slow and steady reduction in household reliance on poor-quality fuels, the air pollution from these fuels continues to be a key factor in the deaths of these youngest infants.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/air-pollution-now-biggest-health-risk-in-india-says-report/article32912916.ece

AAP on Wednesday demanded the immediate removal of Rekha Sharma, chief of the National Commission for Women, for her “derogatory and shameful” tweets against women. The party also called her “anti-women”.

“NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma has repeatedly tweeted in foul, vulgar, cheap, hateful, misogynistic and derogatory language against women. BJP’s ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ was not a slogan for any positive campaign, but a caution to the nation to protect the girls from the grip of BJP leaders,” AAP leader Atishi said while addressing a press conference.

Ms. Atishi said that there is an unending list of BJP leaders who have committed crimes against women.

“If the NCW chairperson uses such cheap language against women, then how can a woman expect justice from the institution headed by her?” she asked.

300,2020/10/22,Delhi HC raps govt. for ‘starving’ district courts,"Funds for basic facilities, required to run the courts efficiently, yet to be released

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday expressed extreme displeasure at the government for “starving” the district courts of finances for the basic facilities required to run the courts efficiently.

A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subromanium Prasad remarked that despite the district courts generating revenue to the tune of around ₹482 crore over the past three years, the Delhi government has been procrastinating when it comes to releasing funds.

“Any obstruction in the discharge of constitutional function of the courts must be viewed seriously,” the Bench remarked.

Fines collected

It highlighted that in 2018-19, the district courts had collected fines amounting to ₹80 crore, which was remitted to the Delhi government and court fee worth ₹96 crore was sold in the same year.

In 2019-20, fines worth ₹89 crore was collected by the district courts and court fee worth ₹102 crore was sold.

“Between July 1, 2019 to October 12, 2020, traffic fines to the tune of ₹115 crore have been collected by the virtual traffic courts and deposited with the Delhi government,” the High Court said.

It said several directions were issued in the recent past to the government to clear the pending files relating to sanctions or revalidation for providing facilities to the district courts for efficient discharge of judicial obligations.

Adequate support staff

The pending sanctions include providing adequate support staff, including group ‘C’ staff and official vehicles for the judges to commute to court.

“All the said issues have been hanging fire for a fairly long time,” the High Court said.

Keeping in mind that 150 judicial officers are due to be posted in the next couple of months and their courts cannot be made functional without adequate support staff, the Bench directed the High Court registry to release ₹2.52 crore from its budget to the district court.

“The said amount shall be returned to the Delhi High Court immediately on funds being made available by the Delhi government to the district court, which exercise shall be completed on or before December 31, 2020,” the Bench said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-hc-raps-govt-for-starving-district-courts/article32912460.ece

304,2020/10/22,Some respite for Delhiites as AQI may improve slightly,"Gopal Rai launches ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign

The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram and Noida deteriorated slightly and was in the ‘poor’ category on Wednesday, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

However, the air quality of Delhi is expected to improve slightly on Thursday, as per System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a government-run monitoring agency.

“The overall air quality index [AQI] has marginally deterioratedtoday [Wednesday]. It is forecast that the air quality may improve by tomorrow [Thursday] to the ‘poor’ category due to cleaner easterly wind intrusion. The AQI will be in the ‘poor’ to lower end of the ‘very poor’ category on Friday and Saturday,” SAFAR said in a statement.

The AQI of Delhi was 256 and the values for Gurugram and Noida were 263 and 264 respectively, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin on Wednesday, which is an average of the past 24 hours.

Fire count

The stubble burning fire counts around Haryana, Punjab and neighbouring border regions of Delhi were 849 on Tuesday, said SAFAR. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to PM2.5, a chief pollutant, in Delhi is estimated to be around 15% on Wednesday and is likely to decrease due to change in wind direction. The local wind speed is only ‘moderate’ and the wind direction in neighbouring States is favourable for a “moderate” transport of pollutants to Delhi due to stubble burning.

In a related development, the Delhi government on Wednesday launched the ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign to reduce air pollution.

“I appeal to all the residents of Delhi to join the campaign as part of the war against pollution. Till now, the Delhi government and various agencies were involved in the war. Today, we are reaching out to two crore people of Delhi to participate in this fight,” Environment Minister Gopal Rai said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/foi8oq/article32912404.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22RAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/some-respite-for-delhiites-as-aqi-may-improve-slightly/article32912405.ece

306,2020/10/22,Complete avataras,"Of the many avataras of Lord Narayana, Rama and Krishna avataras are considered complete avataras. What is so special about them? In the case of other avataras, the Lord came for a certain purpose, stayed on the earth briefly, and left the moment the mission was accomplished. But not so in the case of Rama and Krishna avataras, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse.

Thirumangai Azhvar lists the Lord’s avataras in one of his verses, where he refers to Parasurama as ‘Rama,’ and to Balarama again as ‘Rama.’ But the Rama avatara which is placed between these two, is not referred to as the Rama avatara! Instead, Thirumangai Azhvar uses the word ‘thaanaai,’ meaning He Himself. This indicates the importance of the Rama avatara. Valmiki says Rama lived on the earth for 11,000 years. Krishna lived for more than a hundred years.

But why did the Lord come to this earth in the first place? In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord answers this question. He says it is to protect virtuous people, to destroy the wicked and to establish dharma. But just one action could have accomplished the other two goals. If the wicked, who harmed the good, were killed, then automatically dharma and good people would be protected. The Lord is avApta samasta kAman — there is nothing for Him to experience; nor is there anything that He has not experienced. So why did He come to earth? And if dharma has to be protected, He just has to will the death of the wicked and it will automatically happen, and the rest will follow. Kooratazhvan asks Varadaraja of Kanchi these questions in his Varadaraja Stava. The answer is also there in Kooratazhvan’s verse. He says during His avataras, the Lord is in the company of those who have a humble status. His avataras, thus, show His saulabhya.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/complete-avataras/article32911649.ece
307,2020/10/22,One of the oldest mosques in Hyderabad loses its minarets,"Long spell of rain in Hyderabad has caused immense destruction to the city’s heritage.

One of the oldest mosques in Hyderabad lost its shorter minarets during the recent rain spell. “I heard a loud sound and then we lost electricity. We rushed out to see a heap of rubble. Luckily nobody was injured,” says Renuka, a resident of Shaikpet where the disused mosque exists surrounded by houses, shops and a buffalo shed.

The rubble has been cleaned and dumped at the rear of the mosque where it can be identified by the large round stones that gave shape to the minaret. “Most of the mosques in the area do not have inscriptions, and so I date them using my seriation of stylistic changes and dates are approximate. The large mosque at Shaikpet serai dates by inscription to AD 1633, but there are other mosques in the area that are both before and after it,” says Robert Simpkins, Professor of Anthropology in Porterville College, who has studied the mosques and serais (wayside inns) in Hyderabad dating to that period.

“This is news to us. We had persuaded the Department of Archaelogy and Museums to allow us to clean the mosque four months back as there was vegetal growth. But immediately after we cleaned it they locked it up,” says a Telangana Waqf official. While the mosque is a waqf property its upkeep and maintenance is the responsibility of the Telangana Department of Archaeology and Museums.

The mosque has remnants of blue ceramic tiles on one of the intact minarets. Finished with limestone mortar, the mosque is a representative of Qutb Shahi era architecture with florid use of stucco and liberal use of vegetal and geometric patterns.

Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy has underscored the need for stringent action against the encroachers of lakes, storm water drains and other water bodies in and around the city in light of the recent devastation in the twin cities. He also urged the State government to hold a meeting with all political parties and domain experts to decide on the “tough decisions”.

The Minister on a tour of various rain-hit areas in the capital throughout the day on Thursday observed that encroachments on the water bodies was the main cause of the large-scale inundation and damage to several residential colonies and slums due to the heavy rains of last week.

“Hyderabad brand image has taken a beating and the onus is on everyone to rise above political differences to protect its reputation,” he affirmed. Mr. Reddy visited many flood-hit areas in Assembly constituencies areas of Secunderabad, Sanathnagar, Nampally and Amberpet of Secunderabad parliamentary constituencies and assured assistance to the affected people.

With the arrest of four persons, Banjara Hills police cracked a theft case and recovered 1.25 kg of gold ornaments of 1.43 kg of stolen booty, worth ₹1 crore.

The accused are Govti. Niranjan (40), Pavanam Balapeer (32), G. Ranjit Kumar (22) and M.Venkataiah (55), all migrated from Nagarkurnool district to Hyderabad in search of livelihood. Another accused Kumar Rajaram is still at large.

While Pradeep was returning on a two-wheeler, he met with an accident at Banjara Hills and lost the gold ornament bag. “Due to heavy rainfall and storm, the bag with his cellphone was not traceable,” he said.

On a complaint lodged by Ajay Kumar, a case was registered and during the course of investigation, police found that four days after the incident, on October 12, the missing mobile phone was turned on at Jagathgirigutta and within seconds it was switched off.

Based on the last location, the teams went to Jagadgirigutta and verified all the mobile shops. “After painstaking efforts they traced the stolen mobile and with the help of surveillance cameras the accused were apprehended,” Mr. Kumar said.

After the accident, when Pradeep started screaming that a bag containing gold ornaments was lost, Govti Niranjan, who heard him, started searching for the bag and found it near his hut. “But he did not hand over the bag to Pradeep or police to tide over his financial crises as well as to complete construction of his house in his native village,” the officer said.

Close to 400 personnel from across CISF, Octopus, local police, GHIAL security, Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF), terminal operations, Apollo medical centre and other departments were involved in a high-decibel counter terrorist drill at the Hyderabad International Airport on Thursday.

The full-fledged mock exercise on “counter terrorist contingency” was held around 11 a.m at western departure ramp of the airport. During this drill a mock terror situation was simulated as per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) with activation of relevant security protocols leading to successfully neutralizing of the mock terrorists.

313,2020/10/22,Coronavirus | CSIR-CCMB working on three varied potential COVID-19 vaccine platforms,"At the same time, the CCMB Director cautioned that an ‘effective’ vaccine could be many months or years away.

CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) Director Rakesh Mishra on Thursday disclosed the institute has been working on three varied platforms in association with other CSIR labs in Chandigarh and Kolkata on potential vaccines to deal with COVID-19 virus.

“These platforms are slightly different from the vaccines currently under testing. They are based on ‘pseudo virus’ and ‘pre-processed protiens’. We are now testing them on mice, if they are responsive, we will give the technology to Aurobindo Pharma for making of vaccines,” he told the media during the launch of ‘CoronaAID’ food supplement.

At the same time, he cautioned that an ‘effective’ vaccine could be many months or years away. “It may or may not come. We should be prepared to fight this pandemic without a vaccine. Even if we are lucky to get a vaccine out by the end of the year or later, it could take many months to vaccinate the 1.30 billion people across the country because of the logistics required in maintaining cold storage chains and likely requirement of more than one dose,” he explained.

Yet, any vaccine’s efficacy could only be determined over a course of time of several months or a couple of years because no one can predict how effective it could be to people of different age groups. “It is only after six months or a year we can claim how the vaccine has functioned. But then never before in history so much effort and money have gone into combating a single virus so we keep the fingers crossed,” said Dr. Mishra.

Since it has been now established that 20-30% country’s population have antibodies there is a possibility of ‘herd immunity’ happening in next six months or one year when the infection rate may come down but this cannot be “rushed”, he asserted.

In the meantime, “we cannot afford to crowd hospitals even though capacities have been enhanced since March-April. The focus should continue to be on testing and isolation,” said Dr. Mishra.

The CCMB Director reiterated the ‘Social Vaccine’ doctrine. “We have to learn to live without a magic medicine or vaccine for a while by wearing a face mask, maintaining social distancing and practising hand hygiene - wash hands every time especially when you want to put something in the mouth,” he maintained.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ma38en/article32918699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rakesh-K-Mishra,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/csir-ccmb-working-on-three-varied-potential-covid-19-vaccine-platforms/article32918700.ece
314,2020/10/22,Nayani Narasimha Reddy: from a trade union leader to State Home Minister,"The former Home Minister passed away early on Thursday.

Former Home Minister Nayani Narasimha Reddy, who died early on Thursday, was a trade union leader and a founder member of State unit of Hind Mazdoor Sabha, one of the five national trade unions. He was 86.

He was diagnosed with pneumonia when he was admitted to Apollo Hospitals on October 13 after he complained of breathlessness. The oxygen levels in his body were found to have dropped sharply.

Fondly called ‘Narsanna’, he is survived by wife, a son and a daughter.

Mr. Narasimha Reddy was born into an agricultural family in Neredugomma village near Devarakonda in erstwhile Nalgonda district. He joined politics attracted by the socialist ideology of Ram Manohar Lohia. He was Janata Party MLA twice from Musheerabad constituency in combined Andhra Pradesh in 1978 and 1985.

He plunged into the separate-Telangana movement after K. Chandrasekhar Rao floated the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in 2001. He was actively associated with all the party activities ever since. In the absence of Mr. Rao, it was Mr. Narasimha Reddy who was given the responsibility of hoisting the national flag on occasions such as Independence and Republic Days at the party office. He was also the party representative at several platforms on the demand for formation of Telangana State.

Elected for the third time as MLA from Musheerabad on TRS ticket in 2004, Mr. Narasimha Reddy was one of the six Ministers of the party to share power with the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy-led Congress government in the State. The TRS pulled out of the alliance, both in UPA government at the Centre and the State, after two years. As Backward Classes Minister, Mr. Narasimha Reddy was in charge of YSR's native Kadapa district. He had lost a by-election in the term of the Assembly from 2004 to 2009 and the general elections in 2009.

After the formation of Telangana State in 2014, he was made Home Minister by Mr. Rao. He also handled the subjects of labour and employment. As he was not a member of the Assembly, Mr. Narasimha Reddy was inducted into the Cabinet of Mr. Rao as a Member of the Legislative Council. He was denied party ticket to contest Assembly elections in 2018.

Mr. Narasimha Reddy was known for his tough appearance in spite of advancing age. The name ‘Bullet Narsanna’ became his sobriquet as he was familiar riding the Bullet two-wheeler before joining the TRS.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/g938ey/article20002144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY08NAYANINARASIMHAREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nayani-narasimha-reddy-obituary/article32914486.ece
315,2020/10/22,"Musicians, know your rights","Stop Record Play, a recent webinar, encouraged artistes to start asking questions about royalties, contracts and licensing

Although most Indian classical music composers identified their works with a clear watermark, a signature phrase or word, the act of claiming credit was considered disrespectful to not just the sanctity but to the universality of music. Today, however, given the highly commercial nature of music dissemination, copyright is a topic of urgency. And one that performers must grapple with — especially with concerts having gone online.

“Nothing in our talim (training) prepares us to negotiate today’s music world of royalties, contracts, licensing etc. The moment you say, ‘here are the terms; please put them in writing,’ you will be met with hostility, and comments like ‘Even Pt. Ravi Shankar played for us. He never asked us for anything’,” said Hindustani vocalist Shubha Mudgal, talking at Stop Record Play, a recent webinar on recording contracts, copyright and creative hierarchy in classical music.

Viveick Rajagopalan

Organised by Mridangamela, an initiative by mridangists Viveick Rajagopalan and Anantha R. Krishnan, it was a key webinar for these times. As Viveick explains, “The object was to make the classical music community aware of their rights and get them to start asking questions. Our music is cloaked in bhakti, and rightly so, but if it is only that, why do music labels ask for legal rights for performances from the artistes? Artistes have substantial rights, actually.”

The other panellists were Sandhya Surendran, entertainment lawyer; Jataneel Banerjee, founder and artiste, Grand Philharmonica Orchestra in the U.K.; and Aishwarya Natarajan, founder, Indianuance, a production and consulting organisation representing musicians. The idea was to remove the discomfort around legalities. As Anantha says, “We wanted artistes to know that it is within their rights to ask about these issues.”

Anantha R. Krishnan

One key legal distinction discussed was that between ‘underlying rights’ — which refers to the lyrics and the melody; and ‘sound recording rights’ — which means the performers’ arrangement of the same.

Claiming royalty

Sandhya pointed out that it is only in 2012 that singers were also given equal rights under the Copyright Act. Today, singers as well as composers and lyricists are entitled to get a share of the royalties when a piece is performed. “In classical music, lyrics are often assumed to be ‘traditional,’” said Aishwarya. This means the composition is not proprietary. There is, however, no legal definition of what makes a lyric traditional.

And this is where the problem arises. In Hindustani music, for instance, there are many compositions that are extracted from literature and many don’t have a clear signature, compared to Carnatic music where most composers have identified themselves within their compositions. The vague definition leads to piquant situations. As Shubha said, some of her compositions have been referred to as ‘traditional’ by some performers.

The best route for vocalists who have cut albums is to join The Indian Singers’ Rights Association. The website, isracopyright.com, is a government-recognised society that can license recordings and distribute royalties. Though its current membership seems to be mostly drawn from playback singers, nothing precludes classical singers from joining.

Instrumental recordings

What about classical music instrumentalists? Sandhya explained that here, copyright would be possible only if the instrumentalists are acknowledged as composers. Otherwise, since there is no registered copyright society in India for non-vocalists, their performer rights are currently non-enforceable.

The confusion that prevails today can be gleaned by the fact that Shubha was once sued for singing her own composition. It has been a bitter experience, she said. “Some of the biggest exploitation comes from the most celebrated and awarded artistes in the country, who often have not bothered to pay any part of their fee to their co-artistes.”

Contrasting the system with that in the U.K., Jataneel said that in the U.K., the position is crystal clear — the label and the performers divide the proceeds of recordings equally. The performers’ part is further divided among the featured and non-featured performers. There are associations like Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) in the U.K. and Sound Exchange in the U.S. that undertake collective rights management of their members’ sound recordings.

The Indian classical music world has another problem. Given its deeply hierarchical nature, can younger artistes playing with senior musicians ask questions about what they are signing up for without being pulled out of the concert. This is something performers must come to terms with. As with the issue of sexual harassment, new norms that challenge hierarchies need to be created.

As Shubha said, exploitation exists, and it is important to be aware of it and be forearmed.

The important thing for artistes is to be aware of exactly what their obligation is. Is it just the concert alone one is signing up for? Is there going to be recording? What will the recording be used for? Will there be a further income stream?

Said Aishwarya, “If you are an accompanying artiste, ask the featured artiste if there are any agreements with the organiser beyond performing at the concert. Is there going to be any further commercial exploitation?” These could include a commercial release later, using part, or all, of the concert for other purposes, etc.

Option to share

Every artiste has the right to decide whether or not they want a recording publicly shared. Even for online performances (such as on Facebook Live), Aishwarya’s advice is to ask for them to be taken down within a specified period in order to prevent later misuse.

Underscore Records (underscorerecords.com) has free, downloadable model contracts and letters of agreement, that both soloists and accompanists can use when entering into agreements with organisers.

The question need not always be whether or not the artiste intends to charge a fee for a particular use of a performance or how much to charge. The more important question is that all artistes be aware, ahead of performances, of all the uses of their work.

As Shubha said, “We really don’t want to be a litigious community known only for contracts and agreements to the detriment of music. However, we should be conscious of what we are signing up for and how much we are willing to give away.”

316,2020/10/22,"To sir, with love","P.S. Narayanaswamy played a vital role in passing on his impeccable musical legacy to a legion of students

The mischievous twinkle in his eyes was unmissable. He was full of zest and joie de vivre. He was compassionate and magnanimous. PSN sir, as he was fondly called, epitomised the adage, ‘Art is a reflection of one’s inner self.’ Whether it was singing the sangathis of his guru Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer or drinking his steaming hot cup of kaapi or listening to a raga alapana, he did it all with complete involvement.

PSN sir tuning the tambura

An exemplary musician and a generous guru, sir donned several hats with effortless ease. My earliest memory of him was when he visited my first guru and his close associate, K.R. Kedaranathan. After keenly listening to our singing, he would point out each child’s skill and discuss with our guru what was best for us. I saw the same meticulous approach and care when I subsequently trained under him. He made learning enjoyable and meaningful.

His vadyar (Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer) meant the world to him. Every sangathi he learnt from him was passed on diligently. He believed in upholding classicism and adhering to his bani. And yet, as a teacher, he gave his pupils, wings to fly. “His greatest attribute as a guru was offering his sishyas a rich, layered and varied experience. He gave them freedom to enrich their canvas, fusing his guidance and their exploration and enabling them to find their own path,” say vocalist-duo Ranjani and Gayatri.

Bharathi Ramasubban, who learnt under PSN sir from childhood, says, “An ashutosha, he took immense pleasure in the smallest of things. Sir allowed his students the time and space to blossom.”

Nurturing talent

Whether senior disciples like Udupi Gopalakrishnan, Balamuralikrishna, Abhishek Raghuram, Calcutta Shankar, Shankar Srinivas, Radha Parthasarathy; or younger ones like Sunil Gargyan, Prithvi, Akshay Padmanabhan and Manasvini (impossible to list all the names), every single student gained through his tireless nurturing and the pride he showed in their progress.

Guru P.S. Narayanaswami seen with his disciples

He would take efforts to listen to the concerts of all his disciples and encourage them. “He had a unique way of dispelling doubts and anxiety when he attended a student’s concert,” says vocalist Gayathri Venkataraghavan.

A.S. Murali recalls how he never took any dakshina for teaching, but a small amount of whatever a student gave volitionally would be put into a hundi to be used for charity purposes.

C.R. Vaidyanathan is glad to have had the chance to provide him vocal support during his concerts and for being able to teach students in Narada Gana Sabha in his presence.

PSN sir was devoted to Tyagaraja, Sadasiva Brahmendral, and Kanchi Mahaswami. He raised funds and organised the Tyagaraja Swami Akhandam in Tiruvaiyar during Sivaratri, and the Brahmendral aradhana at Manamadurai every year. Even after he stopped travelling, he would visit the Tyagaraja Vidwat Samajam in Mylapore.

Talented tunesmith

An amazing tunesmith, PSN sir set to tune the songs of Ramalinga Swami and Narayana Tirtha and the Mooka Panchashati. He valued the knowledge he gained by interacting with vidwans during his tenure at the All India Radio.

P.S. Narayanaswamy was unaffected by the many honours he received, some of them being the Padma Bhushan, the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, and the Sangita Kala Acharya title from the Music Academy. These recognitions did not divert him from his primary goal of disseminating music. “His music is like the elixir, the magic potion that has been fed into us organically,” says Kunnakudi Balamuralikrishna.

Words seem inadequate to describe P.S. Narayanaswamy. As I try to reconcile to the fact that I will never again sit in his class and enjoy his warmth and kindness, I remind myself that the torch he lit must keep burning bright. The music will always pay homage to him.

317,2020/10/22,100 slokas in 100 ragas,"Shakuntala Murthy’s ‘Soundarya Lahari’ project is an offering for Navaratri

Music is an integral part of the Navaratri experience. Devi-themed concerts and the release of albums mark the nine-day festivities. This year, the Bengaluru-based musician and teacher Shakuntala Murthy has set the 100 slokas of the ‘Soundarya Lahari’ to tune in 100 ragas.

“The first part, ‘Ananda Lahari’, with 41 verses, describes the union of Shiva and Shakti, and the remaining 59 verses are an ode to the beauty of Parvathi. One needs to appreciate the lyricism in the slokas to understand the magnificence of Shakti,” says Shakuntala.

Soundarya Lahari in raga format is nothing new, but each stanza of four lines has been set to a different melodic scale by Shakuntala. “The aim was to encourage the musically-inclined to explore more ragas and the uninitiated to get acquainted with 100 different raga scales,” she says.

The Shankar Mahadevan Academy Trust has selected the work as part of its ‘Archive to Alive’ project. The project not only preserves the works of the maestros, but makes them accessible to all. “You can learn freely as self-study, or choose a paid course, to be taught by an instructor from SMA,” says Deepa Sridhar, trustee of the Academy.

It took Shakuntala four months to complete this project. “It did not involve just composing in different ragas but notating the 100 slokas in those ragas. I also had to work on the Sanskrit enunciation.”

Shakuntala has earlier worked on a dance-musical, ‘72 Nritya mela Raga Malika’, based on Melakartha scheme of Carnatic music. “I interspersed the three-hour production with dance pieces to highlight bhava, rasa and bhakti,” she says.

Getting here

The octogenarian, who hails from a family of musicians and musicologists, is a gold medallist in ‘Vidwath-music’ and a graded artiste of All India Radio, Bengaluru.

“Music was not a hobby, but a passion,” says Shakuntala. Along with her vocalist-sister Sukanya Narayan and percussionist-brother Krishnamurthy, she launched an album of dasa-sahitya, ‘Smarisu Manave’. The three also co-authored the book, Sangeetha Akshara Swara Hridaya for advanced music students to create kalpanaswaras.

321,2020/10/22,Hyderabad at the fashion weeks,"Fashion films replace runway frenzy at the LMIFW and LFW this season

Fashion Weeks have gone digital this year. At the recently concluded Lotus Makeup India Fashion Week (LMIFW) organised by the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) and the ongoing Lakme Fashion Week (LFW), the backstage frenzy has been largely replaced by fashion films. Designers have been showcasing their collections through films shot mostly outdoors, enabling safety protocols for the models during the pandemic. For once, the focus is more on the collections rather than showstoppers or the front row celebrities.

Here are a few collections by Hyderabad designers:

Ode to Taramati

Gaurang Shah

Filmed in the picturesque Taramati Baradari with Sufi music wafting through the heritage structure, Gaurang Shah’s collection ‘Taramati’ featured 30 handwoven saris. Showcased on the Sustainable Day of LFW, the collection prided itself in creating a heritage line of saris that inspires from the aura of the bygone era. The fashion film is a throwback to the past, when Hyderabad evenings were characterised by dance and music. The intricacies of ikat weaving, the finery of Kanchi silk, the painstaking Patan Patola double ikat weave, kota, uppada, Benarsi, paithani and complex jamdani weaves were all part of this heirloom collection. The handwoven saris are accentuated with aari embroidery, chikankari, kasuti, kantha and Parsi embroidery, among other techniques. The colour palette varies from beige to sunny yellows, wine reds to magenta and purple, and greens.

The LMIFW focussed on spring-summer 2021 and looking ahead to the season, Archana has put forth a collection that subtly incorporates the floral motif. Titled ‘Do you suppose she’s a wildflower?’, the line has saris, dresses and functional separates. The pastel hues of dusty pink and ivory whites that Archana’s label is known for, pervades this collection too. The ensembles come alive with ruffles, floral motifs sewn such that they seem perched on the fabric, and pearl embroidery detailing. The label underplays the embellishments, believing that less is more. The label looks to transcend fickle fashion trends and promote slow fashion, as it moves towards being a zero-waste fashion house.

322,2020/10/22,Congress begins signature campaign,"New farm laws, enacted by the Centre, are an attempt to hand over crores of farmers and their farm lands to corporates, said Virudhunagar MP, B. Manickam Tagore.

Talking to press persons after inaugurating a signature campaign organised by the party against the farm laws, he said that these legislations would eventually transfer the farm lands to corporates like Ambani and Adani.

All States, where mandis and cooperative societies have strong network, are opposing these laws. “Even in Tamil Nadu, we have good farmers and small traders with link to sell their produce. There could be some irregularities here and there. But, with these new laws, not only farmers but smaller traders of foodgrains also would be wiped out,” he said. He said that around 2 lakh signatures would be collected in Virudhunagar district till Deepavali and on November 19, these signatures would be handed over to the President Ram Nath Kovind.

He was also critical of the AIADMK government that was supporting the laws. It showed that it was against the welfare of farmers.

People can drive their car to the lawn inside the hotel where the drive-in restaurant will function. “Families can place orders from the restaurant and the food will be delivered to their car. They can enjoy their meal inside their car while maintaining personal distancing with other customers,” said Mr. Guneswaran.

The customers can also have food at tables that are located far away from each other.

The drive-in restaurant will function on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings from 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. The restaurant would offer a variety of food options, appealing to all age groups, said Mr. Guneswaran.

A large screen has been installed on the lawn where cricket matches and other important videos would be screened.

When the DMK got permission to organise a flag-hoisting function in front of bus stand on Wednesday, as former AIADMK MLA G. V. Markandeyan, who defected to the DMK recently, wanted to make his presence felt, the AIADMK too approached the police at the eleventh hour for permission to hold a similar function at the same spot. Anticipating unsavoury incidents, police denied permission for AIADMK function.

However, the AIADMK cadre, led by Vilathikulam MLA Chinnappan, tried to take out a procession to the bus stand, but was stopped by the police. They picked up a heated argument with the police and staged road roko.

Meanwhile, the DMK, which was told not to violate the lockdown protocol on crowd congregation, mobilised around 500 persons including Thoothukudi MLA Geetha.

330,2020/10/22,"Furnish scan copy of answer sheet, says HC","Considering the plight of a Class XI student, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Directorate of Government Examinations to see to it that a scan copy of the economics answer sheet is furnished to him and the same is re-evaluated.

The court was hearing the petition filed by G. Ramesh who sought a direction to the authorities concerned to furnish a copy of his son G.R. Balaji’s economics answer sheet and to re-evaluate the same. The grievance of the petitioner was that his son had secured 506 out of 600 marks in the Class XI examinations for the 2019-2020 academic year. However, he had only secured 55 out of 100 marks in economics.

The petitioner said that his son was a bright student and had applied for a scan copy of the answer sheet through his school so that he could apply for revaluation. However, due to network connectivity issues, the school could not upload the application.

During the course of the hearing, the State submitted that a government order issued in this regard had made it clear that the application for a scan copy of the answer sheet should be uploaded within a prescribed time, otherwise the request will not be entertained.

334,2020/10/22,Final phase of river-linking project in begins Tirunelveli district,"Work is scheduled to be completed before January-end

With the State government’s allocation of ₹161 crore, work on the fourth and final phase of Tamirabharani-Karumaeniyar-Nambiyar river-linking project began at Aayankulam near Thisaiyanvilai in the district on Thursday.

Radhapuram MLA I.S. Inbadurai and Executive Engineer of Public Works Department (River Linking) Gnanasekaran inaugurated the 20-km-long project.

The work was taken up on an outlay of ₹369 crore to use about 2.765 tmcft (20% of 13.76 thousand million cubic feet) of surplus water available in the Tamirabharani every year. The excess water would be diverted through Kannadian channel and a 75.17 km-long flood carrier channel would be formed to take the water to the dry regions of Nanguneri and Thisaiyavilai in Tirunelveli district and Sattankulam in Thoothukudi district.

As the 6.5-km-long Kannadian channel’s carrying capacity was increased from 450 cubic feet per second (cusecs) to 3,680 cusecs, formation of a new channel to be dug up to M.L. Theri, a sand dune, near Sattankulam in Thoothukudi district, from Kannadian channel at Vellankuzhi was started. The proposed canal can carry 3,200 cusecs of water.

There are many canals that will connect the 75.17-km-long canal with a host of tanks in the basins of Karumeniyar and Nambiyar and the Manimuthar’s tributaries such as Pachchaiyaar, Koraiyaar and Yelumichchaiyaar. The main canal will link with the Pachayar.

When the project is completed, it will benefit 50 villages in Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts, of which five are in Palyamkottai taluk; 17 in Nanguneri taluk; 10 in Radhapuram taluk; 16 in Sattankulam taluk and two in Tiruchendur taluk. With the surplus water, irrigation facilities can be provided to about 23,040 hectares in the two districts.

Of about 1,076 hectares of land required for the project, 994 hectares fell under the category of dry land and 14.5 hectares under wet land. About 68 hectares were poromboke lands.

Since the State government, with the hope of getting the assistance from the Centre, released funds, foundation stone was laid in February 2009 by then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and the first two phases of the project could be completed. As the then DMK government could not get mandatory clearance from the Union Government’s Ministry of Environment, the river-linking scheme was in limbo after the change of guard in 2011.

The then MLA of Radhapuram, M. Appavu, approached the High Court and got a few directions to the State government in support of the project. The undue delay has meanwhile increased the project cost from ₹369 crore to ₹872 crore.

“The project, which was launched during the DMK regime without any assurance and clearance from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest, had to be stalled for want of funds. The AIADMK government later got assurance and ₹217 crore from the Centre to execute the third phase of the work. Now, the fourth phase of the work has started with the funding of ₹161 crore and will be completed before January-end,” Mr. Inbadurai said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/1avcqv/article32920491.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA23-LINKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/final-phase-of-river-linking-project-in-begins-tirunelveli-district/article32920483.ece
335,2020/10/22,MP raises doubt over reservation policy adopted in SBI recruitment,"Madurai

Su. Venkatesan, Madurai MP, has raised suspicion over implementation of reservation in recruitment for SBI-Junior Associates, on declaration of the preliminary examination results and cut-off marks for different categories of short-listed candidates for Tamil Nadu.

In a letter addressed to Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Taawar Chand Gehlot, he said the cut-off marks for general category was 62. But it was the same for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Scheduled Castes (SC) too. While it was 59.5 marks for Scheduled Tribes (ST), for economically weaker sections (EWS), it was just 57.75.

“Since these cut-off marks are not in consonance with social realities, the question arises on whether reservation has been implemented properly in declaration of results,” he said.

It must be clarified whether general category candidates belonging to all reserved categories were put in general list of candidates when they secured more marks than the prescribed cut-off marks for the said category.

He also sought the number of OBC, SC, ST, EWS candidates in the general category list.

Since cut-off mark for EWS was lower than that of OBC, SC and ST, how many EWS candidates appeared for the examination and how many were short-listed.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP also sought the range of marks secured by all reserved category candidates and sought the norms followed for treating candidates of reserved categories to figure in the general list.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/mp-raises-doubt-over-reservation-policy-adopted-in-sbi-recruitment/article32920423.ece
336,2020/10/22,130 COVID-19 kidney patients recover at Asaripallam GH,"A total of 14,470 persons tested positive; over 5,000 admitted as inpatients at hospital

The Kanniyakumari Government Medical College and Hospital at Asaripallam, which was flooded with fresh positive cases everyday till a few weeks ago, has so far successfully treated over 11,000 patients including 130 with chronic kidney disease.

Out of over two lakh tests conducted till now, 14,470 were found to be positive till Wednesday (October 21). Of this, the medical college hospital has taken care of 5,000-odd cases as in-patients and another 6,000-plus cases in COVID Care Centres established outside the campus.

“Of this, 1,165 cases were in Intermediate Care Unit and another 1,340 patients had to be treated with oxygen support due to heavy lung involvement,” says Suganthi, Dean, Kanniyakumari District Medical College Hospital.

Though most of the cases could easily be diagnosed with the viral infection following regular test protocols, 1,440 had to undergo CT scan for confirmation of infection in the lung and another 4,200 X-rays were taken by the Department of Radiology.

The most challenging cases that the doctors at the hospital had to deal with were 130 positive patients with chronic kidney disease. More importantly, 440 of them had to undergo heaemo-dialysis sessions at regular intervals.

“Since these patients would be very weak owing to prolonged treatment and medication for the failed kidneys, the viral infection would pose serious threat to their lives. So, our team of doctors had to neutralise the virus even as haemo-dialysis was being done periodically,” Dr. Suganthi points out.

Of the 383 positive pregnant women, 183 deliveries were conducted at the hospital, where 260 paediatric positive cases, including 56 symptomatic cases, were also treated successfully.

“Though we take utmost care in ensuring the best medical care to all positive patients, we lost 208 to the viral infection, mainly due to underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiac ailments,” she says.

Dr. Suganthi attributes the greater success rate to the efforts of the district administration to create modern medical facilities for treatment of COVID-19 patients and the doctors, nurses and other workforce of the hospital.

“When we were in need of well-equipped intensive respiratory care unit to treat seriously infected COVID-19 positive cases, the steps taken by the Collector ensured creation of the facility within the shortest period. The timely establishment of an ultra-modern facility saved the lives of several hundreds of patients, including a 76-year-old woman after 53 days of treatment, who would have to spend a few lakhs of rupees in private hospitals,” says Dr. Suganthi.

Suresh Rajan reposed their faith in Kanniyakumari District Medical College Hospital after they tested positive for the viral infection.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/130-kidney-patients-recover-at-asaripallam-gh/article32920292.ece
337,2020/10/22,Iranian onions arrive in Madurai markets,"Heavy rains in onion-growing States has led to a dearth in supply

Around 25 tonnes of onions, imported from Iran, arrived at the onion market on East Marret Street here a couple of days back to arrest the steep rise in price of onions. Traders say limited quantities of imported onions have arrived in Mattuthavani and Paravai markets.

S.T.M. Thiagarajan, a trader in central vegetable market in Mattuthavani, said the imported onions were being sold for ₹15 to ₹20 lower than the price of onions brought from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh - the major areas where onions are cultivated.

“In the wholesale market, imported onions can be bought for ₹65 a kg. But Indian onions are sold up to ₹80, depending on the quality. These Iran onions were largely purchased by hoteliers as it is profitable for them, said S. Alagurajan, a trader on East Marret Street. “Since these imported onions are huge, many residents don’t evince much interest in buying for their domestic use,” he added.

Mr. Thiagarajan said the traders were planning to bring in more quantities of the imported onions. Discussions were being held with other traders to stabilise the selling price of the imported onions. However, purchasing smaller quantities of Iranian onions will not have a huge impact in reducing the price of onions, said S. Manuel Jeyaraj, president of Madurai Central Vegetable Market and Perishable Commodities Merchants Co-ordinated Association.

The traders attribute the rise in prices of onions to reduced supply from other States. “The city is receiving only 50% of onions that is usually bought by the traders. This is mainly due to heavy rains in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, which destroyed the crop” said Mr. Jeyaraj.

Till Deepavali

The prices of onions would remain high till Deepavali, said president of Central Market Wholesale Vegetable Vendors Association P.S. Murugan.

An Cooperation department official said onions would be sold for ₹45 a kg at farm fresh outlets in Madurai in two days. In the initial phase, we have placed an order for one tonne onions. We will increase the quantity of onions sold at the outlets based on demand from the public,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/rt6396/article32924833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23MACITY-ONION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/iranian-onions-arrive-in-madurai-markets/article32919952.ece

In a statement, Virudhunagar Collector, R Kannan, said that out of the 24,000 hectares of farm area targeted to raise Maize, the farmers have so far covered 15,596 hectares. The standing crops were of 15 days to 45 days old.

The statement appealed to the farmers to follow integrated crop protection measures as successfully done last year to contain the spread of the pest.

Among them are summer ploughing, mixing of neem cake with the soil and using of pheromone traps.

Deep ploughing: Recommending deep ploughing, the officials from Department of Agriculture have advised the farmers to mix 250 kg of neem cake for every hectare.

The seeds should be treated with 10 grams of bio-pest control like Beauveria Bassiana and 10 gram of Metarhizium 30% (FS) or 6 mg of cyantriniliprole 19.8% and Metarhizium 19.8%. This will help in controlling of the pest in the first 15-20 days of crop.

The farmers were also advised to go for simultaneous sowing in all the farm lands.

A uniform distance of 60 cm by 25 cm gap should be maintained for lift irrigation crop and 45 cm by 20 cm gam for rain-fed areas. Besides, for every 10 rows, 75 cm of gap of one row should be maintained.

One solar-powered trap and 12 pheromone trap should be laid for every hectare, the Collector said.

Besides, beneficial crops like cowpea, sunflower gingelly and sorghum and samanthi can be raised a border crop and black gram and green gram can be raised as inter crop.

Farmers should detect eggs and larvae of Fall Armyworm under the maize leaves and eradicate them Lime powder should be mixed with sand in the ratio of 1:9 and sprayed on crown.

If the pests are found in 5% area of the farm, neem seed mixture or azadirachtin 1,500 ppm 5 ml in one litre of water or 2 ml of azadirachtin 1% in one litre of water should be sprayed.

To prepare need seed mixture, 10 kg of neem seed should be powdered and it should be mixed in 50 litres of water and kept for one day.

After filtering it, 200 gram of khadi soap powder should be mixed and added to 200 litres of water.

If the spread of pest is upto 10%, then Bassiana Thuringiensis Kurstaki 400 gram or one kg of metarhizium anisopliae or one kg of Beauveria Bassiana should be sprayed.

No chemical pesticide should be used between flowering and harvesting period.

According to the prosecution, Sivan Perumal, 34, hailed from a village under Ambasamudram All Women Police Station limits. He was married to Jaya for nine years and the couple did not have children. As he was desperate to have a baby, Sivan Perumal tried to lure his 15-year-old niece, a beedi-roller living near his house, with the help of his wife.

Jaya invited the girl to her house under the pretext of showing a new saree. The girl went to her uncle’s house on February 15, 2017. Jaya asked her to try the saree and locked the house from inside. Sivan Perumal, with the help of Jaya, sexually assaulted her. The couple pacified her with the promise that Sivan Perumal would marry her as they wanted to have a baby.

341,2020/10/22,Mangalore University shelves plan for digital evaluation of answer scripts,"Yet-to-come govt. approval for the new method among reasons for dropping the idea

Mangalore University which had earlier planned for taking up digital evaluation of nearly 2.50 lakh answer scripts of its final semester examinations of 2019-20 has shelved the move. Now, it is going ahead with the process as per the conventional method, according to Registrar (Evaluation) of the university P.L. Dharma.

If the evaluation of the answer scripts of post-graduate examinations, which got over on October 6, has begun, the answer scripts of undergraduate examinations, completed on October 19, will be evaluated from October 27. More than 50,000 students had appeared for the examinations, he told The Hindu.

Mr. Dharma said that the digital evaluation plan has been shelved mainly due to two reasons. The teachers indicated that as all eligible evaluators are not familiar with the new move, there could be delay in completing evaluation thus, leading to delay in the announcement of results.

Secondly, last month’s floods in Udupi and heavy rain in Kodagu have created issues in uninterrupted internet connectivity and power supply to digital evaluation centres identified in Udupi and Kodagu districts.

In addition, the government’s approval for the new move was awaited. Hence, the plan was dropped.

He said that the evaluation of the papers of undergraduate examinations will go on briskly at three centres in Dakshina Kannada and one centre each in Udupi and Kodagu districts for five days from October 27 to October 31.

In the earlier years, the evaluation of undergraduate examination papers scheduled only at a centralised centre in Mangaluru took about 13 days to complete. As there will be five evaluation centres this year the evaluation will be completed early. About 48,000 students have appeared for the undergraduate examinations, he said.

The papers will be evaluated at the University College, Canara College, Government First Grade College in Mangaluru, MGM College in Udupi and at FMKM College in Madikeri, he said.

“We will ensure that the answer scripts reached all the three centres much in advance to enable teachers to begin the evaluation without any delay,” he said and added that the results will be announced at the earliest to enable students to join the post-graduate courses for 2020-21 by November 15.

He said that 50 % of the answer scripts of post-graduate examinations have been evaluated now.

Mr. Dharma said that the answer scripts of 60 students who wrote the undergraduate and post-graduate papers in the examination centres of the university in Bhutan, Manipur, Jammu and Kashmir, Lakshadweep Islands and in Dharwad have reached the university.

The examinations had been conducted there as a one-time measure due to the COVID-19 situation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/hc6eo4/article32914833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22MNUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/mangalore-university-shelves-plan-for-digital-evaluation-of-answer-scripts/article32914834.ece

349,2020/10/22,Government decides to open new pension accounts in post offices,"People are getting services on their doorsteps now, says tahsildar

Taking advantage of doorstep delivery of service, the State government has decided to have new pension accounts in post offices, said Mangaluru Tahsildar Guruprasad here on Tuesday.

Answering a question about pensions during the general meeting of Mangaluru Taluk Panchayat, Mr. Guruprasad said that services at post offices have improved.

A host of services, including correction of name in Aadhaar card, were now available at the post office. People are getting services on their doorsteps. Accounts at the post office can be operated online. “The new pension accounts will now be opened at post offices, instead of in banks,” he said.

Following the merger of Vijaya Bank with the Bank of Baroda and of Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank, Mr. Guruprasad said, there has been change in account numbers of pension accounts in the Syndicate Bank and Vijaya Bank.

“Not all account holders have obtained their new passbook and intimated the authorities of the change. This has resulted in pension not getting deposited,” he said.

Action has been taken to collect all such accounts and give it to the Lead Bank Manager who will then ensure changes are carried out. Some panchayats, including Kotekar and Jokatte, have taken the initiative to contact the affected pension holders and approach the bank for carrying out the changes.

Mr. Guruprasad said that the Revenue Department will hold a Pension Adalat from November first week at the panchayat level.

To another question, Mr. Guruprasad said that the district administration has earmarked 184 acres of land in Mangaluru taluk for allocation to people without houses.

Land where construction has not been taken up are being taken back. Where buildings are constructed in an unauthorised manner, such buildings are not demolished but instead, acquired for use as hostels, government quarters or other purposes of the government.

350,2020/10/22,‘Involve religious leaders in work to stop falling female child sex ratio’,"‘Join hands with govt. to create favourable environment for girls’

Work to arrest falling female child sex ratio in Dakshina Kannada will succeed if religious leaders are involved in the programme, said Mangaluru City North MLA Y. Bharath Shetty here on Tuesday.

Speaking at the “Beti Bachavo Beti Padavo” programme, Dr. Shetty said that it was sad that female child sex ratio in the district, which is known for its literacy, continues to be poor.

For every 1,000 male children, the number of female children stood at 931 in 2019-20.

It was at 950 in the previous year. Dakshina Kannada, Yadgir, Haveri and Gadag are among those districts where female child sex ratio is poor in the State.

Dr. Shetty said that religious leaders should come forward and work with the government in creating a favourable environment for girls.

These leaders should sensitise people about the place girls have in society. Respecting women should become a norm in society.

“We should act fast and stop this downward trend of female child sex ratio,” he said.

Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat president Meenakshi Shantigodu also spoke. Mayor Diwakar participated.

The Department of Women and Child Welfare organised the programme. As many as 17 girls who have scored good marks in the SSLC examination were felicitated.

351,2020/10/22,Time is ripe for a demand push: Sanjeev Sanyal,"‘Govt. had been reticent about a large stimulus earlier so as to conserve resources for the future’

In a fresh signal that the government could unveil another stimulus package soon, the Principal Economic Advisor in the Finance Ministry on Thursday said that the time was right for a generic push to spur demand in the economy.

The official’s remarks come on the back of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement on Tuesday that she had not shut the door on another relief and stimulus package to revive the economy, which had shrunk an estimated 23.9% in the April-June quarter.

“The general problem is that there has been a shock to the system and we need to rebuild demand,” Principal Economic Advisor Sanjeev Sanyal said at the CII Financial Markets summit. “Some of it is coming back naturally, but not in every sector such as hospitality.” Mr. Sanyal stressed that the government had been ‘reticent to provide a large demand stimulus at the time of the lockdown as there was no point in pushing the accelerator with one foot on the brake.’

“We took a call that if we use up all our resources during April, May, June, July or August, then we won’t have resources to push later on. Now, as we are getting off the brake, we do want to press the accelerator,” stressed Mr. Sanyal. “The time has come for a generic push for reinflating demand in a fuller sort of way; not just provide safety nets as we had been doing so far,” he added.

‘Think big’

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to meet industry captains and large global investors soon, Mr. Sanyal urged domestic businesses to refrain from seeking sectoral sops such as interest subventions.

“Many of you will be interacting with the PM soon. Do talk to him, this is a moment in history that we do want to do big things. So, please do not go with the kind of ideas often seen in these meetings, seeking some subvention… Please do not waste our time with this. Think big. Ask for big things and if it can be done, we will do it,” he said. Mr. Sanyal pointed out how ‘difficult’ changes like labour laws and agricultural market liberalisation had been pushed through.

Terming reforms in the legal system and the police critical, Mr. Sanyal said a national debate was needed to push them through. “The single biggest constraint to India’s growth is the poor quality of contract enforcement and legal resolution,” he added.

The nitty-gritties for including Indian bonds in global bond indices were also being ironed out, Mr Sanyal said. “Those who make the bond indices – JP Morgan, Bloomberg, Barclays… they have looked at [the changes we have made on ownership limits that restricted India’s inclusion], are happy with it and holding consultations with their investors.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ravkgh/article32922068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23BUSHOPS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/time-is-ripe-for-a-demand-push-sanyal/article32922069.ece
352,2020/10/22,Base year of Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers revised from 2001 to 2016,"New series not to affect DA given to govt staff for now.

The Labour and Employment Ministry on Thursday revised the base year of the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) from 2001 to 2016 to reflect the changing consumption pattern, giving more weightage to spending on health, education, recreation and other miscellaneous expenses, while reducing the weight of food and beverages.

Labour Bureau Director General D.P.S. Negi said the new series would not have an impact on the dearness allowance (DA) given to government employees for now. The linking factor of the new series to the old series was 2.88, something which employer federations had raised in consultations.

Speaking at the launch of the new series, Labour and Employment Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar said the Bureau was expected to bring out the new series of the CPI for agriculture workers, which currently has the base year of 1986-87) by August next.

Every five years plan

Labour and Employment Secretary Apurva Chandra said that in the future, the Bureau would work towards revising the index every five years. The reduction in weight to spending on food and beverages indicated an increase in disposable income.

Mr. Gangwar said the new series, representing the latest consumption pattern, would be in the interest of workers. The number of centres, markets and the sample size for working class family income and expenditure survey were all increased.

The Minister also released the first index, with 2016 as the base year. The index for September, calculated for 88 centres as opposed to the previous 78 centres, was 118.

The sample size was increased from 41,040 families to 48,384, and the number of selected markets for collecting retail price data from 289 to 317.

A Ministry statement said, “The number of items directly retained in the index basket has increased to 463 items as against 392 items in the 2001 series...The weight of food and beverages has declined over time whereas the weight of miscellaneous group (health; education and recreation; transport and communication; personal care and effects; household goods and services etc.) has increased substantially under 2016 series vis-à-vis earlier series. The weight of housing group has reported an increasing share over period of time”.

The weight to food and beverage was reduced from 46.2% to 39%, while spending on housing increased from 15.2% to 17%.

The index for October would be released on November 27. Apart from measuring inflation in retail prices, the CPI-IW was used to regulate the DA of government employees and industrial workers, as well as fixing and revising minimum wages in scheduled employments, the statement said.

Before the latest revision, the series was revised from 1944 to 1949;1949 to 1960; 1960 to 1982 and 1982 to 2001, it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5gfrx9/article32922201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23thgangwar,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/cpi-iw-base-year-revised-from-2001-to-2016/article32916619.ece

Bajaj Auto Ltd. reported a 19% decline in net profit to ₹1,138 crore for the quarter ended September 30, from a year earlier. The company attributed this to lower treasury income and government restrictions on export benefits.

While ONGC was the sole bidder for six blocks, OIL was the lone bidder in all the four blocks it bid for.

ONGC won all six blocks where it was the sole bidder and also the one block where Invenire Petrodyne had bid.

The previous bid round, OALP-IV, too had seen just eight bids coming in for seven blocks on offer. ONGC had walked away with all the seven oil and gas blocks on offer.

Prior to OALP-V, the government had awarded 94 blocks in four OALP bid rounds in the last two and a half years. These 94 blocks cover an exploratory area of about 1,36,800 square kilometers over 16 Indian sedimentary basins.

In the latest bid round, about 19,800 sq km of the area was offered for bidding, according to DGH.

OALP-IV was the first round on revamped terms approved in February 2019.

Unlike previous rounds, where blocks were awarded to companies offering a maximum share of oil and gas to the government, blocks in little or unexplored Category-II and III basins are now awarded to companies offering to do maximum exploration programme.

The 11 blocks under OALP-V are spread across eight sedimentary basins and include eight on land blocks (six in Category-I basin and one each in Category II and III basins), two shallow-water blocks (one each in Category-I and II basins) and one ultra-deepwater block (Category-I basin).

At the time of the launch of OALP-V, DGH had stated that the round is expected to “generate immediate exploration work commitment of around USD 400-450 million.”

“An area of 1,36,800 sq km has already been awarded under OALP bid round I, II, III, and IV. These OALP bid round-V blocks would add a further 19,800 sq km. Overall exploration acreage of India would then increase to 2,36,600 sq km,” it had said at that time.

Of the 94 blocks awarded in the first four rounds of OALP, Vedanta has won the maximum at 51. Oil India Ltd has got 21 blocks and ONGC another 17.

After OALP-V, ONGC’s tally has gone up to 24 and that of OIL to 25.

Under OALP, companies are allowed to carve out areas they want to explore oil and gas in. Companies can put in an expression of interest (EoI) for any area throughout the year, but such interests are accumulated thrice in a year. The areas sought are then put on auction.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cexgzs/article32918359.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ONGC,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ongc-wins-7-oil-blocks-oil-4-in-latest-bid-round/article32918360.ece

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have raised stake in billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries to a record 25.2% in the quarter ended September 30, according to the company’s regulatory filing.

Reliance Industries (RIL) on Thursday filed a statement showing the shareholding pattern for the quarter ended September 30.

The statement showed FII holding 165.8 crore shares or 25.2% of the total shareholding.

In the previous quarter ended June 30, foreign investors held 163.07 crore shares of 24.72%.

In an investor note, JP Morgan said FII holding in RIL has hit a new high.

“As has been the case now for two years, FII’s stake in RIL hit new highs. Surprisingly, mutual funds’ (MF) stake declined by 25 basis points quarter-on-quarter and was the second straight quarter of stake decline,” it said.

363,2020/10/22,Dr. Reddy's Laboratories shuts units after cyber attack,"The drugmaker isolates all data centre services, shuts down some production facilities temporarily

India’s leading pharmaceutical company Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories has temporarily shut down some of its production facilities in the wake of a cyber attack in the early hours of Thursday.

While a statement from the drugmaker said it had isolated all data centre services to take required preventive actions after the detection of a cyber attack, sources said as a precautionary measure the company had also temporarily shut down some of the production facilities. Details of the units were not immediately available.

In an intimation to the stock exchange, the company said “in the wake of a detected cyber-attack, we have isolated all data centre services to take required preventive actions.”

CIO Mukesh Rathi said “we are anticipating all services to be up within 24 hours and we do not foresee any major impact on our operations due to this incident.”

Besides involving one of the biggest names in the Indian corporate sector, the cyber attack comes close on the heels of Dr. Reddy’s receiving Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approval to conduct Phase 2/3 human clinical trial for Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia, in the country.

COVID-19 vaccine

This followed Russia’s sovereign wealth fund RDIF, which is piloting the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, announcing last month a collaboration with Dr. Reddy’s for clinical trials and distribution of the vaccine in India.

On Saturday, the drugmaker and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) had announced receipt of the DCGI approval for an adaptive phase 2/3 human clinical trial for Sputnik V vaccine. It was a multi-centre and randomised controlled study, which would include safety and immunogenicity study, they had said in a joint statement.

As per the plan, the RDIF intends to supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to Dr. Reddy’s. Subject to completion of successful trials and registration of the vaccine by regulatory authorities in India, deliveries could potentially begin in late 2020, the RDIF had said in September.

364,2020/10/22,Maintaining productivity with a ‘reduced’ workforce,"When only one-third of the workers can be on the shop floor at any point in time, it is necessary to rethink the composition of each work group

Nine out of every ten Indian organisations are now battling workforce shortage — that is the finding of an online survey conducted by Kronos Incorporated in partnership with Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) in July.

Half of them attribute the shortfall largely to dedensification and isolation policies in place to check the spread of the Coronavirus, and partly to migration of workers back to their hometowns.

The survey, in which around 200 chief human resource officers, employee engagement heads and heads of business partners participated, identified flexible work timings, creation of a multi-skilled workforce and institution of rewards and incentives as measures taken to improve workforce utilisation and productivity. Increased automation in workforce management was also suggested.

Matching competencies

Amit Sharma, CHRO, Volvo Group, points out that at any point in time, only one-third of the workers can be on the shop floor, the challenge lies in ensuring every such group have all the critical skills for manufacturing work.

“After the lockdown was lifted, the challenge was about getting the right competencies for our manufacturing facilities while maintaining the 33% upper ceiling in terms of workforce presence. So, we scaled down our manufacturing volumes in line with the lower demand. We then conducted process-wise line balancing, which is a key input process for the Main Assembly — like Paint, Weld and Pre-Assembly —in the first two weeks of the restart,” says Sharma.

Next they distributed the competencies on offer through their workforce equally across the days, by working on the composition of the three groups.

“Absenteeism was controlled by ensuring everyone feels psychologically safe and by ensuring all infection prevention protocols were undertaken at the site,” says Sharma.

Besides asking employees to be flexible about their work, Volvo started regular dialogues with the union to ensure alignment.

Multiple hats

Duroflex Mattresses reskilled its employees in the factory so that they could multi-task and fill in for those employees who have migrated to their hometowns.

Anushree Singh, Country HR Head – AkzoNobel India, says they used the early months of the lockdown to multi-skill and retrain their employees and this has come in handy.

“Having a trained workforce with fungible skills provides the flexibility to move people around. At one of our sites, where we saw Coronavirus cases increase, teams in the production function rose to the occasion and fulfilled the work demands on the shop floor,” says Anushree, adding that manpower shortage in certain functions has necessitated new ways of working and creation of new roles.

“In my own department, for instance, we have made a hybrid role that could cater to some immediate demands,” says Anushree. She believes this situation is providing employees with greater exposure and an incentive to learn new skills.

Hiring temporary staff

Navneet Singh, CEO, Avsar HR Services, says reverse migration of workers is driving the demand for temporary staff. “Earlier, we were sending 500-1000 temporary staff on a monthly basis, now in the last three months we have seen the demand more than double for a month,” says Singh. The turnaround time from clients has also grown shorter.

“We typically have two types of contract — Fixed Term Contract that is for a fixed duration of time, say 11 months, and short-term ranging from one day till the completion of the project. Increasingly we are seeing many of our clients looking for short-term contracts,” says Singh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/8dilev/article32914649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23OPMIGRANTWORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/maintaining-productivity-with-a-reduced-workforce/article32914650.ece
365,2020/10/22,The battered Puja economy,"With a possible reduction in revenue by half, this year’s Durga Puja may be a dim affair

It is time for dew drops, soft essence of nyctanthes, and the usual holiday season in West Bengal. Most importantly, it is time for the annual extravaganza concerning Durga Puja – the greatest social and cultural feast of Bengal.

A few years ago, one of my Malaysian collaborators — a professor in Kuala Lumpur — visited Kolkata during the Puja days. Despite being accustomed to some of the greatest festivities on the globe like Christmas, Chinese New Year, Rio Carnival and Hanami, he found the splendour and magic of Durga Puja astonishing — he was amazed by the hundreds of colourful and thematic pandals (marquees) built temporarily in street-corners and parks, idols of the goddess Durga and her family members prepared in varied styles and depictions, streets flooded with light and the smell of street-food, a riot of colours, with millions of people out for pandal hopping, dressed in their finest clothes, with an average daily footfall of 2-3 lakh in any pandal.

Sizeable economy

Possibly, the only reasonable estimate of the Puja economy is available in a 2013 ASSOCHAM report, wherein the size of the economy was estimated at ₹25,000 crore, at an unbelievable 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The situation might have changed in between, but at this CAGR, the projected size of the Durga Puja economy could be about 2 lakh crore in 2020 — around 13-14% of West Bengal’s GDP. This is in stark contrast to less than 2% contribution of the Rio Carnival to the GDP of Rio de Janeiro, 1.35% sharing of Oktoberfest to the GDP of Munich, slightly more than 1.5% contribution of Mardi Gras to New Orleans’s GDP, and Hanami generating around 2.25% of Japan’s GDP.

However, the economy of Durga Puja needs to be re-evaluated this year as a deadly pandemic has ravaged the world. As a direct impact of shrinking economy, millions of job losses and reduction in income, and amid the fear of contagion, the festivity and economy of the Puja are bound to be curtailed considerably. The Rio Carnival in February and Mardi Gras triggered contagion among the respective communities. And some Indian States saw a surge in COVID-19 cases after Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam. In fact, the Calcutta High Court has ordered that area within a radius of five metres for small pandals and 10 metres for big pandals in West Bengal will be out of bounds for visitors. No wonder, many of the big Pujas will be offering glimpses of prayers and festivity virtually — a remarkable change in the ever-changing history of Durga Puja of Bengal.

Large network

The ecosystem of community worship in Puja has changed with the economic liberalisation in India. Corporate funding and outdoor advertising, accounting for about 90% or more of the funding, and the traditional five-day festival extending to 10-12 days in the recent years, entail additional business scope, for sure. Also, with the expansion of online marketing, the purchasing pattern has changed remarkably for Puja shopping as well. Furthermore, unlike Oktoberfest or the Rio Carnival, which primarily depend on visitors, Puja economy in Bengal is mostly self-sustained. Puja shopping for apparel, shoes, electronic gadgets, spending over idols, pandals, and tourism, all contribute to the economy.

Also read | In Kolkata, a few Puja committees respond to desperate appeals by doctors

My ‘guesstimate’ is that usually community worship contributes about 15% to the economy, about 10% is spent in pandal hopping, inbound and outbound travel contribute about a quarter, and the remaining half of the Puja economy might be attributed to Puja marketing. The COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardised Puja-trips of Bengali people. Assuming that the expenditure on community worship would be reduced to half, and that on pandal hopping would become a quarter, and assuming almost no Puja-trips, about 80% of usual Puja marketing might make the Puja economy half of what it could normally be.

My ‘guesstimate’ might be way wrong, but there is no doubt that the Puja economy has been shattered by the pandemic.

366,2020/10/22,Back to basics in algorithms,"The NEP 2020 must take a larger view of computational thinking and move beyond just data science and AI

It is heartening to note that the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) envisages putting greater emphasis on mathematical and computational thinking throughout the school years, starting right from the foundational stage of the learning process. Indeed, algorithmics — the abstract process of arriving at a post-condition through a sequential process of state changes — is among the earliest human intellectual endeavours that has become imperative for almost all organised thinking. However, the framing in the NEP appears to put it at the same level of distinction as the more instrumental ‘coding’, and almost as a mere tool towards the utilitarian goals of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. We think this is misplaced.

The notions of computation and algorithms are as old as mathematics and date back to the early stages of representing numbers and geometrical figures and manipulating them for various uses. Their origins can be traced back almost to the beginning of the Mesolithic stone age, when the notions of counting and addition began to take form. All early learning of counting and arithmetic is method-based, and hence algorithmic in nature, and all calculations involve computational processes encoded in algorithms.

The Hindu Explains | What has the National Education Policy 2020 proposed?

Form of expressions

Modern algorithms, almost in the same form as we know them today, began to appear around 300 BC. Some of the earliest examples are procedures to compute the greatest common divisor of a pair of numbers, or the factorial, which appeared in Euclid’s books of Elements, and the descriptions of fast exponentiation and the Fibonacci sequence which appeared around 200 BC in the treatise of Chandah-Sutra by Acharya Pingala. The core algorithmic ideas of modern AI and machine learning are based on some seminal algorithmic ideas of Newton and Gauss, which date back a few hundred years. Though the form of expressions of algorithms — the coding — have been different, the fundamental principles of classical algorithm design have remained invariant.

In the modern world, the use of algorithmic ideas is not limited only to computations with numbers, or even to digitisation, communication or AI and data science. They play a crucial role in modelling and expressing ideas in diverse areas of human thinking, including the basic sciences of biology, physics and chemistry, all branches of engineering, in understanding disease spread, in modelling social interactions and social graphs, in transportation networks, supply chains, commerce, banking and other business processes, and even in economic and political strategies and design of social processes. Hence, learning algorithmic thinking early in the education process is indeed crucial.

Coding, however, is merely the act of encoding an algorithmic method in a particular programming language, which provides an interface such that the computational process can be invoked in a modern digital computer. Thus, it is less fundamental, and indeed great algorithms have been designed through the ages even without this facility. While coding certainly can provide excellent opportunities for experimentation with algorithmic ideas, they are not central or indispensable to algorithmic thinking. After all, coding is merely one vehicle to achieve experiential learning of a computational process.

National Education Policy 2020 | New curriculum, assessment system to roll out from academic year 2021-22

Learning the fundamentals

Rather than the intricacies of specific programming languages, it is more important at an early stage of education to develop an understanding of the basic algorithmic processes behind manipulating geometric figures, computing with numbers, solving systems of equations, modelling road networks and social graphs, and applying algorithmic ideas to everyday problems. In fact, an overemphasis on learning the nitty-gritty of specific programming languages prematurely — even from middle school — may distract from focusing on the development of algorithmic creativity. Indeed, this is a common outcome of the overly utilitarian skills training-based approaches evidenced throughout the country.

The devil lies in the details, and, while the NEP guideline of introducing algorithmic thinking early is a welcome step, it must be ensured that it does not degenerate and get bogged down with mundane coding tricks at a budding stage in the education process.

367,2020/10/22,The manacles of caste in sanitation work,"Despite laws, workers in the field in India still face stigma and are devoid of essential rights

Even in 2020, the Indian government and our civil society continue to grapple with the inhuman nature of manual scavenging. While civil society started a movement in the 1990s to abolish dry latrines, the focus now is on manhole deaths and provision of safety equipment to sanitation workers. The movement has been demanding the abolition of the dehumanising practice of the manual removal of human excreta and calls for the introduction of mechanisation for handling waste. Various State governments and the previous Central governments have responded to these civil society demands by introducing different laws to stop manual scavenging and provide incentives to build toilets.

If, on the one hand, the civil society has tended to approach this issue as a collective problem that needs to be addressed by the State, on the other, the current ruling dispensation seems to be framing the issue as a spectacle in the form of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and is addressing the problem in terms of an obstacle in the way of tourism promotion.

Problematic descriptions

In 1993, the then government promulgated an Act prohibiting the construction of unsanitary dry latrines and employing manual scavengers.

The Act defined ‘manual scavenger’ as a person engaged in or employed for manually carrying human excreta. On August 18, 2010, I recorded a video of a sanitation worker entering a manhole without any safety gear, in the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad, for Dalit Camera, a YouTube channel that documents the experiences of Dalits, Adivasis, Bahujans and other minorities. I also approached various social movements that were campaigning against dry latrines and requested them to include this aspect of manual scavenging to their campaigns, to no avail.

The government’s description of dry latrine was a problem, as it defined dry latrine as “latrine other than a water-seal latrine”. Manual scavenging was not just a practice related to dry latrines, but also to insanitary latrines and open defecation. Until the introduction of the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act in 1993, State governments had a post called ‘scavengers’. A scavenger’s job was to manually remove human excreta in households and designated places. The local authorities levied scavenging tax on houses for availing this service. But after the Act was introduced, State governments themselves became agencies that would enforce prohibition of the construction or usage of dry latrines.

Ten years later, the Safai Karamchari Andolan, a social movement that campaigned against manual scavenging, along with other organisations, filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court. The demand was to direct State governments and Union Territories to strictly enforce the law to stop the practice of manual removal of human excreta. Mounting pressure from civil society, coupled with the intervention of the Supreme Court, forced the Central government to conduct a survey of manual scavengers in 2013. The survey found that dry latrines and manual removal of human excreta still persisted. In the same year, the government introduced the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act.

Though the construction of dry latrines has drastically reduced, the number of deaths in manholes, sewers and septic tanks continues to remain high. The present government had plans to amend the 2013 Act to completely mechanise the cleaning of sewers and manholes and build new sewers. But neither the past nor the present amendment addresses the issue of labour safety. Same is the case with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which skirts the issue of labour rights and the stigma attached to sanitation. As a matter of fact, in Tamil Nadu, all political parties have trade unions for government servants, except for sanitation workers. Bodily wastes are seen as unholy elements that need to be kept away from places of living, cooking, studying, or worshipping. Not only toilets, but even cleaning work is seen as a lowly job in India. Dalit movements have been found wanting in this regard — there have hardly been any organised movements to demand permanent job status for sanitation workers. Most sanitation contracts are given to private contractors or self-help groups, and such staff hardly have ID cards, leave alone the protection of medical insurance policies.

Workforce in sanitation departments is recruited via open competition. The local administration usually approaches particular caste members during such hiring. The situation is so dire that while we find volunteers to distribute food and undertake rescue operations during natural calamities, hardly any volunteer offers to do clean-up work or dispose of dead bodies. During the last Chennai floods, sanitation workers from the Nilgiris district were made to travel in garbage trucks to Chennai. This situation has continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Tamil Nadu, sanitation workers are asked to work in newly formed COVID-19 wards. For example, the Gudalur municipality in the State issued an order to six of its staff members to work in COVID-19 wards. Similarly, in Kotagiri town panchayat, officials asked the sons of sanitation workers to work in COVID-19 wards.

Question of dignity

Unlike other labour forces, sanitation workers do not have a separate rule-book that lays down guidelines for their work timings, holidays, a proper place for roll call, removal from duty, etc. For example, in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu, all the sanitation workers have to stand outside the office during the morning and afternoon roll calls. If they reach early, they are seen sitting on roadside pavements. Even though there are spaces within the office premises, the officers force them to stand outside. The officials claim that the practice is traditional and that for any change, new rules need to be formed. There are no vehicles for sanitation workers to travel to their designated workspaces, and they have to either walk for kilometres or use garbage vehicles . This is a forced choice and is connected to the dignity of a worker. To put this in contrast, no supervisor would stand and travel with the sanitation workers.

There are hardly any exclusive trade unions for sweepers, and unlike other sections in government or private workforce, their problems are voiced by only those who are not associated with sanitation work — often NGOs. This, I argue, is because in India, sanitation work is caste-ridden and hence, there is an urgent need to dissociate caste from labour.

368,2020/10/22,Return of the socialists: On the victory of Evo Morales’s party in Bolivia,"Following his win in Bolivia, Arce should learn from the successes and mistakes of Morales

Preliminary results of Sunday’s Presidential election in Bolivia point to an emphatic victory for the former President Evo Morales’s Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party almost a year after he was ousted by protesters and the military. While the official results will not be announced for days, exit polls and independent counts give his hand-picked candidate, Luis Arce 53% of the popular vote against his main rival Carlos Mesa’s 29.5%. Mr. Mesa, who was President between 2003 and 2005, has conceded the election. This is as much a victory for Mr. Morales, Bolivia’s first indigenous leader, as it is for Mr. Arce. Mr. Morales left the country, first for Mexico and then for Argentina, after the Generals asked him to stand down in November 2019. Since then, Jeanine Añez, a right-wing conservative Senator, has been the acting President, rolling back many of Mr. Morales’s policies and going after his supporters. But MAS mobilised its supporters and fought back. Mr. Arce promised voters that if elected, he would carry forward the pro-poor socialist legacy of Mr. Morales, while MAS portrayed Mr. Mesa as a representative of the pre-Morales elites, whose rapid privatisation and pro-market policies had triggered frequent mass protests. The results demonstrate that the voters chose the equity-oriented socialist stability, which MAS offered, over the free-market conservatism of its rivals.

The new leader could learn from the achievements and mistakes of Mr. Morales, credited with turning around South America’s poorest country economically. Under his government, Bolivia saw a drop in extreme poverty, from 33% of the population in 2006 to 15% in 2018. He also stepped up public investments, opened more schools and health clinics, built roads and nationalised the oil and gas industry, all while ensuring that the economy continued to expand. These policies helped MAS build a strong connect with the poor, a base which continued to back the party despite last year’s political turbulence. At the same time, his push to stay in power beyond the term limits set by the Constitution helped the Opposition organise itself. He got the ban lifted by a constitutional court after his bid failed in a referendum. This raised questions about the legitimacy of his candidacy in the October 2019 election, which he won but was accused of fraud, leading to protests and his ouster. Mr. Arce’s biggest challenge would be to continue Mr. Morales’s welfare policies, while keeping the battered economy on track. Moreover, the anti-Socialist and mostly white opposition is now more powerful, after ousting Mr. Morales and having run the interim government for a year with the U.S.’s support. Mr. Arce can keep the galvanised opposition at bay only by continuing MAS’s socio-economic “revolution” to expand its support base in a divided country.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/return-of-the-socialists-on-the-return-of-evo-moraless-movement-toward-socialism-party-to-power-in-bolivia/article32911712.ece
369,2020/10/22,A crucial season: On festivals in the time of COVID-19,"Public health messaging must convince people that festivals can be celebrated safely

Faced with a potential reversal of gains that India has made in slowing the spread of COVID-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed against weakening the fight during the annual season of festivals. Over the past six months, numerous individual events have enabled the infection to explode and spread. These have ranged from the opening of wholesale markets and political gatherings to big funerals; many were infected when places of worship were allowed to be thronged. Mr. Modi’s appeal, which comes during the Navratri celebrations, and ahead of Dussehra, Deepavali and other festivals, is to be welcomed, although the opportunity to caution the public was not grasped early enough. Also, in spite of the call to “mask up” on October 8, as part of a communication campaign he launched, its visibility has remained low. Moreover, virus estimations remain a mosaic of data, without a standardised system for testing, tracing and isolation across States. Only broad-brush statistics are available, even as the economy has reopened. The Union Health Ministry’s data point to a rising trend in daily cases in Bihar, Delhi, Maharashtra, Manipur, and West Bengal, while Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, with their high levels of incidence earlier, have started showing a decline in test positivity rates, a more reliable metric than absolute cases. Kerala has experienced a wave blamed on lax behaviour during Onam.

Health messaging on the dangers of another wave of infections can be effective if it is not drowned by repeated emphasis of massive recoveries. States, anxious to present a picture of near-normality to boost economic activity, highlight recoveries over risk, and people are lowering their guard. Mr. Modi has suggested that the fight must not weaken until there is a vaccine, and experts and WHO want countries to learn to live with an endemic virus. In India, the reality is that even as of October 21, the official death toll in a day stood at 717, a not so inconsequential number, and there were 7.4 lakh active cases. The emphasis, therefore, has to be on preparing for the new normal, adopting acknowledged defences such as masking, distancing norms and hand hygiene. In parallel, the Centre should launch policy reform to transform a predominantly commercialised health system into one providing universal coverage. COVID-19 has meant double jeopardy — a loss of income on the one hand and a steep rise in health insurance premiums on the other, after insurers were asked to provide cover for more conditions. Under such circumstances, the cheapest protection against disease and financial loss is prevention, now and into the future. The Centre says it has a communication strategy centred around the theme of safety until March next year. Its efficacy will be tested immediately, by the festival season.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-crucial-season-the-hindu-editorial-on-festivals-in-the-time-of-covid-19/article32911700.ece
370,2020/10/22,D.J. Halli violence: HC grants bail to MLA’s nephew,"He is accused of uploading a derogatory post on social media

The Karnataka High Court has granted bail to Naveen P., nephew of Pulakeshingar MLA Akhanda Shrinivasa Murthy, in a case of him allegedly posting derogatory statements related to Islam on his Facebook account, resulting in large-scale violence in D.J. Halli-K.G. Halli on August 11.

Justice B.A. Patil passed the order while noticing that the investigation has been completed and charge sheet has been submitted to the court and the alleged offences do not carry punishment of more than three years.

Though the prosecution claimed that he is a habitual offender as his social media posts on Hindu deities had caused problem and seven cases were registered against him, the court was informed that he was acquitted in all those cases.

“Merely on the ground that there is threat to the life of the petitioner if the bail application is allowed, it would indirectly affect the fundamental right of the petitioner when the only allegation against the petitioner is that he has posted some derogatory remarks against Prophet Mohammed on his Facebook account and subsequently, the same has been withdrawn,” the court observed while ordering his release on bail.

The court directed the petitioner to furnish a bond for ₹2 lakh and two sureties of the like, and not to tamper with prosecution’s evidence directly or indirectly. The court said his bail can be cancelled if he is found indulging in similar offences again.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dj-halli-violence-hc-grants-bail-to-mlas-nephew/article32920589.ece
371,2020/10/22,BMTC starts trial run of e-bus,"Government to provide ₹ 100 crore to lease e-buses, asks BMTC to prepare action plan.

The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has started trial runs for electric-bus for the second time after a gap of over six years. A Hyderabad-based company has provided a 12 meter long AC e-bus for the trial run.

Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi boarded the bus from BMTC’s TTMC at Shantinagar and travelled till Vidhana Soudha. He was accompanied by the chairman of the BMTC and others. At Vidhana Soudha, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa inspected the bus.

The officials had earlier said that trial runs will be carried out using sand bags and passengers will not be allowed to travel for 15 days.

The Corporation has maintained that during the trial run, performance of the bus will be assessed in terms of battery charging, carrying capacity, performance of bus in heavy traffic roads and others. The bus will be operated on ten roads in the city that include Kadugodi, ORR, Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and others. The bus can run 200 to 250 km in single recharge and seating arrangement is 34+1.

In the year 2014, the BMTC had done a trial run of e-bus for the first time by operating a bus provided by a Chin-based company.

The state government has directed the Corporation to prepare an action plan for leasing 300 e-buses under FAME-II scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) of the central government. The Department of Heavy Industries (DHI) of the Union Government is providing a subsidy of ₹ 55 lakh per bus and ₹ 33.33 lakh per bus will be provided by the state government.

However, the state government has asked the BMTC not to incur any expenditure in the current year. The DHI recently directed the BMTC to issue supply orders by December 31, 2020. In the last couple of years, the BMTC made several attempts to lease E-buses but miserably failed. The Corporation is likely to issue fresh tenders in coming days.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/jl8fcz/article32916602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bmtc,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bmtc-starts-trial-run-of-e-bus/article32916004.ece
372,2020/10/22,Pollutant concentration in city’s air has large spatial variability: Study,"Urban, peri-urban residential neighbourhoods record lowest PM2.5, BC, UPF concentration, whereas major roads recorded the highest concentration

An 11-month-long mobile monitoring of various particulate air pollutants over a fixed 150-km road stretch in the city, comprising major, arterial and residential roads, found large spatial variability along the study route for all pollutant concentrations. While urban and peri-urban residential neighbourhoods recorded the lowest PM2.5, BC (black carbon) and UPF (ultrafine particles) concentration, major roads recorded the highest concentration. Within the neighbourhoods surveyed, concentrations varied with the road type.

The study was conducted by the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) with ILK Labs, University of Washington and University of Texas. It is said to be one of the first large-scale mobile-monitoring studies in India comprising over a million data points. The report, titled ‘Mobile-Monitoring Campaign for Air Pollution Studies in Bengaluru’, stated that the research team completed a total of 27 repeat measurements over the study route to construct a long-term mean pollution map. The study route was divided into four parts, and each part was covered in one measurement day, which spanned almost four hours, from about 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., capturing the rush-hour peak.

On-road measurement of air pollutants – BC, PM2.5 and UFPs – were performed in four parts of Bengaluru. The mobile-monitoring route included the central business district (CBD), a residential urban neighbourhood (Malleswaram), a peri-urban neighbourhood (Kannuru), and an urban-rural transect.

“Kannuru is a peri-urban location used by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for land filling. It is approximately 18 km from the CBD and characterised by less traffic. The area has a quarry due to which heavy-duty trucks ply here. The CBD includes M.G. Road and major roads around Cubbon Park and Vidhan Soudha. The study route reflects variations in the traffic volume, traffic density, driving speeds, and street configurations,” stated the report.

Sreekanth Vakacherla from CSTEP, one of the contributors to the study, told The Hindu that they also covered all seasons to understand on-road pollution. The monitoring campaign started in May 2019 and continued up to the first week of March 2020. There were around 110 measurement days covering all seasons.

“By studying on-road pollution, we wanted to measure pollution levels that the commuter will get exposed to as we are moving closer to the source of pollution and components such as BC are detrimental to health,” he said. Their monitoring platform was a car fuelled by CNG (compressed natural gas), which is low-emitting but not completely emission-free.

Researchers found that each pollutant peaked in different regions along the study route. “Irrespective of the road classification and season, on-road PM2.5 levels were higher than ambient,” the report said. In Bengaluru, garbage/waste burning also contributes to observed on-road BC, in addition to diesel emissions.

Advocating for mobile monitoring in the country, the researchers said, “Air-quality monitoring forms a critical component of various stages of air-quality management. India has nearly 200 monitoring stations (operational during 2010-16). However, the country needs about 40,003 stationary monitors to capture the spatial and temporal variability of air quality,” it said.

“One way of avoiding pollution would be to avoid such roads. But it may not be feasible. We tried to see how many hospitals and schools are there along such roads, and there are many and they house more vulnerable people. In the future, it is advisable for them to not be located on such roads,” Dr. Sreekanth added.

Results

The city centre is not a pollution hotspot in the case of Bengaluru. In addition to some of the busiest commercial areas, the CBD encompasses large green spaces such as Cubbon Park.

The hotspot areas are not the same for all pollutants. PM2.5 peaks (reaching ~60 µg m-3) 10–12 km from the city centre while BC peaks (reaching ~75 µg m-3) 7–9 km away from the city centre.

A clear peak was not seen in UFPs, but values remained high (reaching ~1,50,000 cm-3) till 7 km away from the city centre.

Within the residential neighbourhood, arterial roads connecting to the major roads were characterised by relatively higher PM2.5 levels. Major roads (highways/Outer Ring Road) displayed the highest levels of pollution.

BC and UFPs had the lowest values over residential neighbourhoods (urban and peri-urban), followed by arterial and major roads.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/nhee94/article32914708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGAIRPOLLUTIONP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pollutant-concentration-in-citys-air-has-large-spatial-variability-study/article32911060.ece
373,2020/10/22,MoU signed to integrate metro and railway stations at Yeshwantpur,"BMRCL hopes to complete the work by Independence Day 2021

After a delay of over six years, the authorities have taken initial steps to integrate Yeshwantpur metro station with the railway station. The metro station, part of the Green Line, was opened for commercial operations in 2014, but was not linked to the railway station.

For years, passengers and activists have been questioning the inordinate delay in integration of the two stations.

On Wednesday, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL), in a press release, said that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Bengaluru division of South Western Railway (SWR) to provide multi-transit integration facilities.

An 82-metre-long foot-over-bridge (FoB1) will be built to connect the railway station with the concourse of the metro station. The authorities will also build a second 230-metre-long FoB branching out from FoB1 to provide connectivity between the eastern and western sides of the railway station and metro station. This FoB will also help passengers reach island platforms of the railways.

In another move, an additional road entry will be provided to the railway station from the north-west part of the metro station. Other projects include access to the railway station from the Tumakuru –Bengaluru Road, which is currently blocked, multi-storey parking facilities, bus bays for city buses, an auto stand with larger capacity, pick up and drop points for cars, taxis and autos.

The release further stated that the BMRCL consultancy contract has been given for detailed design on a 1,500-metre-long FoB from Sandal Soap metro station to BMTC’s transit and traffic management centre at Yeshwantpur and linking the Indian Institute of Science campus.

The BMRCL is hopeful of providing the facilities by Independence Day 2021.

374,2020/10/22,CCB questions mall owner and film producer on financial transactions to actor,"CCB officials on Wednesday questioned three people, including a Kannada film producer and the owner of city mall, regarding financial dealings between them and actor Sanjjanaa Galrani who has been arrested in the drug racket case. “We questioned owner of Meenakshi mall Ganesh Rao and film producer Soundarya Jagadish after we found that they had transferred huge amounts of money to Sanjjanaa,” said a source.

The transactions and bank accounts were verified before they were summoned for questioning. While Mr. Rao reportedly told the CCB that the money was a loan, Mr. Jagadish said that the amount he had transferred was part of the remuneration package for the actor who had a role in one of the films he produced.

Mr. Jagadish later confirmed this to the media and said Sanjjanaa had acted in a film he produced and the CCB had questioned him about the same.

375,2020/10/22,Siblings drown in stone quarry pit at Avinashi,"Two brothers who went to take a bath in a stone quarry pit at Avinashi in Tiruppur district drowned on Wednesday.

The police said that P. Ayileshwaran, 10, and his younger brother Balan, 9, went to take a dip in the pit of the defunct stone quarry in Periyayeepalayam on Wednesday afternoon. Their mother Kasthuri, an employee at a garment company in Tiruppur, returned home from work at around 7.30 p.m. but her two sons were missing.

Upon receiving the information, personnel from Avinashi Fire Station retrieved Ayileshwaran’s body from the quarry pit at around 10.30 p.m. At around 7 a.m. on Thursday, the personnel also retrieved Balan’s body. Avinashi police registered a case and the bodies were sent for autopsy to Avinashi Government Hospital, according to the police.

The mother and her two sons moved to Avinashi from Chennai in March. As the stone quarry had remained defunct for nearly 30 years, water had accumulated in the pit and the locals frequently visit the spot to bathe, the police said.

A similar incident was reported on October 12 where two brothers aged 11 years and seven years drowned in River Noyyal within Tiruppur City Police limits.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/siblings-drown-in-stone-quarry-pit-at-avinashi/article32915804.ece
376,2020/10/22,Encroachments pose hurdles to water flow,"They have been obstructing flood mitigation works by the WRD

Areas in the western parts of the city are facing the threat of waterlogging this northeast monsoon. While steps are being taken to improve waterways and waterbodies, breaches in bunds of channels and encroachments have been hindering flood mitigation work.

The Korattur surplus course plays a pivotal role in carrying floodwater from the Korattur lake to the waterbody in Retteri. The surplus course drains into an 11-acre Thangal eri at Kathirvedu and then again travels as a floodwater channel to join Retteri.

J. Rammohan, a resident of Kathirvedu, said the lake acts as a buffer between the two major waterbodies. However, encroachments have resurfaced, blocking the lake’s inlet. This will lead to waterlogging in the neighbouring areas during monsoon. Moreover, action must be initiated against encroachers for damage caused to public property, he added. Residents noted that a portion of the bund and the outlet of the waterbody had been blocked to form a road to create a short route to the neighbouring streets.

It may be recalled that the Water Resources Department had restored the waterbody, along with a voluntary organisation, last year, to increase its storage capacity by 40% and reduce local flooding.

Similarly, the bund of the Red Hills lake’s surplus course was also recently breached, near Thandalkazhani, for a stretch of 50 m by encroachers. It travels for 15 km and joins the sea near the Ennore creek.

However, it is proving to be a challenge for the Department to tackle the encroachments resurfacing on the waterbodies and waterways. Residents want steps to be taken to retrieve the encroached portions of the surplus courses and small waterbodies, to prevent flooding in their localities. Sources in the WRD said that complaints had been lodged with the Puzhal police against the encroachers.

The lack of land records is another challenge when it comes to taking stringent action against encroachers. These are sites that were already demarcated and built as floodbanks, several years ago.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/encroachments-pose-hurdles-to-water-flow/article32913284.ece
377,2020/10/22,Measures taken to face NE monsoon: Minister,"Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar on Wednesday said all steps have been taken to face the ensuing northeast monsoon.

In a bid to mitigate the impact of natural disasters, nearly 14,347 houses have been built in coastal villages under the Coastal Disaster Risk Reduction project. About 488 villages have been covered under the project. Moreover, overhead electricity cables are being shifted underground in districts such as Cuddalore and Nagapattinam to reduce the damages caused during the monsoons.

Highlighting other such measures taken up as part of the preparedness work for the northeast monsoon, the Minister, during a meeting, said fishermen and coastal residents were being provided with digital early-warning systems to disseminate information on natural disasters, at a cost of ₹50 crore.

In Chennai, the project is nearing completion to improve Adyar river and its surplus channels and provide cut-and-cover channels, wherever there are missing links, at a cost of ₹7 crore, he said.

Elaborating on the steps taken to mitigate floods, the Minister said that waterways and irrigation channels, for a distance of 4,154 km, had been desilted. Nearly 7.53 crore cubic metre of savudu soil was removed from waterbodies across the State and a storage capacity of 2.55 thousand million cubic feet had been, he added.

A total of 43,409 first responders had been trained for rescue operations during emergencies. Of this, nearly 14,232 were women. Nearly 4,133 areas vulnerable to floods had been identified across Tamil Nadu.

The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) has directed its section officials to take up pre-monsoon preparedness work in the city on a war footing.

Tangedco, having issued strict instructions to the officials, has also fixed November 7 as the deadline for completing the works.

A senior Tangedco official, sharing details of the works, said that special teams, including field staff from sub-divisional (assistant executive engineer) offices, would be formed for identifying, executing and finally monitoring the safety works at all section (assistant /junior engineer) offices.

The safety works will involve closing open pillar/junction boxes, cutting tree branches that could cause damage to distribution transformers and the overhead cable network, covering exposed power lines above the ground by taking them underground as per standard norms, installing new poles in place of damaged ones and replacing old and worn out overhead cables, wherever necessary.

The senior official said that in instructions issued by the chief engineer of the north and south regions, it was clearly mentioned that poles where electricity supply was served through overhead cable networks should be replaced. This included areas like Vyasarpadi, Ponneri, Ambattur, Avadi, Tondiarpet, Madipakkam, Pallikaranai, Selaiyur and Tambaram.

Furthermore, officials in the ranks of superintending engineers/executive engineers will have to follow up and ensure that the monsoon preparedness projects are completed and in case of delay in their execution, make sure that punitive action is taken against the erring officials.

383,2020/10/22,Man undergoes liver and kidney transplant at Chennai hospital,"The 35-year-old from Delhi had several complications

A 35-year-old man from Delhi recently underwent a liver and kidney transplant at a Chennai hospital. He will be returning home shortly.

Nitin Mittal, weighing 130 kg, suffered from cirrhosis of the liver. He was registered at a hospital in Delhi for liver transplant and was undergoing treatment. During this time, his kidney function deteriorated and he was put on dialysis. He visited Gleneagles Global Health City (GGHC) in Chennai and consulted Joy Varghese, director of hepatology and transplant hepatology.

Mr. Mittal’s wife wanted to donate a kidney but and he was registered for cadaver liver transplant. when tests revealed that she was pregnant, the doctors put Mr. Mittal on medication and sent him back to Delhi.

However, his condition began to deteriorate. His blood count fell to below five (normally it should be between 12 and 17). He was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital in Delhi and his cardiac function was 30% lower than normal. He lost consciousness.

The family became apprehensive and contacted the GGHC liver team for a second opinion. He was transported by air ambulance to Chennai nearly two months ago. Investigations at GGHC revealed that he had fungal growth in blood. He was admitted to the specialised liver ICU for a fortnight and put on round-the-clock dialysis for 3-4 days.

His sister then came forward to donate a portion of her liver. “The transplant surgery took 14 hours. The patient was discharged on the 16th day after surgery,” Dr. Varghese said.

“A dedicated team of critical-care specialists and nurses made sure the patient, and both the donors, remained safe from COVID-19,” said Selvakumar Malleeswaran, head of liver ICU.

“We faced a big challenge in performing dialysis for the patient, who had such low BP, and had to perform continuous renal replacement therapy before and during the surgery,” said K. Muruganandham, senior consultant, urology and renal transplantation surgeon.

The kidney was retrieved through a keyhole surgery. “The kidney started producing urine immediately after implantation. The positivity of the donors and the recipient aided in their quick and smooth recovery,” said P. Muthukumar, senior consultant, nephrology and renal transplant physician.

387,2020/10/22,"In West Asia, it’s a bleak future amid America fading","President Trump’s policy has not factored in the geopolitical consequences of the U.S.’s declining influence in the area

When the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed normalisation agreements with Israel in September, under the mediation of the United States, American President Donald Trump hailed it as a “new dawn in the Middle East”. The so-called ‘Abraham Accords’, which saw the first normalisation between Israel and Arab countries in 26 years, was a rare diplomatic victory for Mr. Trump. It was rare because most of the President’s other big foreign policy bets were either disastrous or inconclusive. The U.S.-Taliban deal is largely seen as American capitulation to the Afghan insurgents; the outreach to North Korea failed to produce any result; the maximum pressure campaign on Iran seems to have backfired; the promise to fetch “the deal of the century” between the Israelis and the Palestinians was a non-starter; and the trade war with China failed to produce any structural shift in the way China does business while tensions between the two countries rocketed. Amid this policy chaos, Mr. Trump at least got something in the ‘Abraham Accords’ to present as a breakthrough. But does it bring peace to West Asia, as Mr. Trump has claimed?

It was evident during the Barack Obama years that the U.S. had overstretched itself in West Asia and North Africa, a region America has deeply engaged with since President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s time. The U.S. had been stuck in an unwinnable war in Iraq. In Syria, it was checkmated by the Russians. Its intervention in Libya turned out to be disastrous. Iran continued to be defiant despite threats and sanctions. Israel was uncontrollable. The Arab allies were upset. Mr. Obama realised the historical necessity of resizing the U.S. presence in the region and pivoting to East Asia where China was steadily on the rise. But the U.S. has both allies and rivals in the region. It cannot just pack up and exit.

Editorial | New order in West Asia: On Abraham Accords

The Obama and Trump years

Mr. Obama, in his second term, adopted a realistic approach to address this problem. He made peace with Iran, accepted the Russian lead role in Syria, left Libya burning, ignored Saudi and Israeli sulking over Iran. But, to balance these, he overlooked Israel’s deepening occupation of Palestine and cooperated with the Saudi attack on Yemen. The plan was to let the regional players establish what he called a “cold peace” among themselves.

When Mr. Trump came to office, he wanted to undo Mr. Obama’s policy legacy. He demolished the Iran deal, brought Israel back to the centre of America’s policy towards the region and prompted the Arab and Jewish allies of the U.S. to join hands. The plan, as it emerges, was to remake the regional dynamics in favour of America’s allies and push rivals to a corner. Mr. Trump succeeded in bringing the Gulf Arab countries and Israel together, but he failed to escape the historical reality which Mr. Obama faced — America’s dwindling influence in shaping the present and future of West Asia. A policy in which the historical reality is not factored in may not produce the desired outcome.

The case of Iran

Take, for example, the case of Iran. The acrimony towards Iran was one of the defining factors of Mr. Trump’s West Asia policy. While pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear deal unilaterally and reimposing sanctions on Iran, Mr. Trump thought the Iranians would flinch once again so that he could extract more concessions from them and cut their regional wings. But the perils of that policy were the predictability of the policymaker’s objectives, and the Iranians were determined to defy him at any cost. Iran responded with multiple cuts on the U.S. and allied interests in the region — from targeting Saudi oil facilities and cargo ships in the Strait of Hormuz to launching rocket attacks at American troops in Iraq. Mr. Trump’s response was the typical American-style response of the good old days when it was in a position to shape the geopolitical outcome in West Asia. He had Qassem Soleimani, one of the top Iranian Generals, killed and declared that the U.S. had re-established deterrence vis-à-vis Iran. But the use of force did not reflect the ground realities. Less than a year after the assassination of Soleimani, the U.S., faced with continuing rocket attacks by Iran-backed Shia rebels in Iraq, is contemplating shutting down the American Embassy in Baghdad, besides withdrawing most troops from Iraq. Where is the deterrence?

Comment | The Arab World and the elusive two-state solution

Open embrace of Israel

While in the case of Iran, misplaced adventurism sabotaged even the available policy options, the Trump administration’s open embrace of Israel — the decision to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, recognition of Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights and the go-head to its annexation of Jewish settlements in the West Bank — sharpened the geopolitical contradictions in the region, instead of bringing peace. The normalisation agreements between Sunni Arab countries and Israel, partly driven by their shared concern of an aggressive Iran in a West Asia sans America, could strengthen the pro-American pillar in the region, but the withdrawal of Arab powers from the Palestinian question would not finish off the Palestinian question. It would rather leave a vacuum in regional politics which non-Arab Muslim countries would seek to fill. This offers new avenues to Turkey, which under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, seeks to re-establish its influence in the region, and Iran, which uses the Palestinian cause to drive public opinion in the Muslim world across the Shia-Sunni divide. In other words, Mr. Trump brought together Gulf Arabs and the Jews, who had had backroom contacts for years, on a public platform. But he also opened the way for the agitated Persians and the ambitious Turks to enhance their weight in the troubled regional politics.

Historically, the withdrawal of empires had seen new conflicts arising in their peripheries. In 1911, Italy invaded the Turkish province of Libya, triggering a dangerous competition with the Ottomans in their decline years. A year later, four Balkan states formed the Balkan League to take on the Ottomans in Europe. The collapse of the British empire left ethnic, religious, geopolitical wounds open across the former colonies. Some of the conflicts in the Caucasus, including the ongoing fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, have their roots in the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Given these examples, it is worth asking if the U.S. is prepared to face the geopolitical consequences of the decline of its influence in West Asia. If the four years of the Trump presidency shows any indication, it is not. The new beginning Mr. Trump promised in the region could very well be that of a more troublesome future.

388,2020/10/22,Potholes on the digital payment superhighway,"The National Payments Corporation of India must be supported and there has to be a rational structure of pricing.

Digital payments have found strong ground, especially in India, increasingly relegating all other modes of payments to the background. It is through a faster system of simultaneous debits and credits that the money value is transferred from one account to the other across banks. It embraces all kinds of operators (including direct benefit transfer by the government) across the country and even internationally, subject to regulatory forbearance. With such versatility and ease of settling financial transactions, the growth of digital payments is going to be phenomenal, supported by banks and Fin-Tech, or financial technology, companies.

Steered by the RBI

There is a long and interesting history behind the evolution of digital payments in India, piloted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and succinctly captured in the Payment Systems in India, published in 1998. A major thrust toward large value payments was effected through the Real Time Gross Settlement System, or RTGS, launched by the RBI in March 2004. The large value payments on stock trading, government bond trading and other customer payments were covered under the RTGS, providing finality of settlement, thereby reducing huge risks such as the Harshad Mehta scam; besides this, it substantially reduced the time taken for settlements. The RBI introduced National Electronic Funds Transfer, or NEFT, and bulk debits and credits to support retail payments around the same time. Now, NEFT is available round the clock and RTGS will follow from December 2020 — only a few countries have achieved this.

Such historical changes brought about by the RBI triggered major changes in the corporate and capital market transactions as well. Today, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the market regulator, is contemplating a T+1 settlement (T is for transaction date) because the underlying consideration of the sale proceeds of the shares get exchanged very fast under the payments system. This is expected to attract more international capital into the Indian market, in turn broadening and deepening the financial market.

An umbrella system

The sterling contribution of this robust payment system, especially retail payments, was seeded and reinforced with the setting up of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) by 10 lead banks at the instance of the RBI in 2009. The idea for this umbrella retail payments institution emerged in the vision document on payments system, 2005-08 released by RBI in 2005. Very few people know about the unwritten history of the background under which this umbrella organisation was mooted. In 2004, a four-member team including this writer visited the Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, on a study tour. This included a visit to the Bangirocentralen (BGC AB), a not-for-profit organisation owned by eight Swedish banks for providing retail payment and related services. The model appeared as an attractive proposition as payments is basically a public good. Thus the idea of the NPCI as a not-for-profit company has a link from the BGC.

The setting up of such an umbrella organisation to build a super highway for digital payments has a strong appeal which was well-appreciated by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, the then RBI Governor, taking a number of policy decisions to spread digital payments and protect consumer interest. However, there were many within and outside the RBI, including in the Indian Banks’ Association, who had apprehensions about the success of such a model for the NPCI.

Data | Significant rise in digital transactions met by surge in cyberfrauds

Indicators of success

With digital payment being a public good like currency notes, it was necessary that the corporation was fully supported by the RBI and the government as an extended arm of the sovereign. It was also necessary to contain expectations on profits, avoiding gyrations of the stock market along with direct or indirect control by powerful private interests which had the potential to dilute the public good character of the outfit. The NPCI’s success against deeply entranced formidable international players, supported by innovative technology, viz. Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), is well recognised by central banks in many other countries. The Bank for International Settlements’s endorsement of the NPCI model in 2019 is a major accolade. If the NPCI has gained such a rare distinction in just 10 years of its successful and path breaking journey, we should be proud to preserve this precious jewel.

There is a demand from some quarters that the NPCI should be converted into a for-profit company to withstand competition. The shareholders of the NPCI can have windfall gains too. But this will be a retrograde step with huge potential for loss of consumer surplus along with other strategic implications. Instead, like the RBI providing free use of the RTGS and other products, the strategy should be to assist the NPCI financially, either by the RBI or the government, to provide retail payment services at reduced price (in certain priority areas). This may also help support expansion of the payment system network and infrastructure in rural and semi-urban areas in partnership with Fin-Tech companies and banks.

Comment | Creating a fair digital payments market

On merchant discount rate

In Budget 2020-21, the government prescribed zero Merchant Discount Rate (MDR), the rate merchants pay to scheme providers, for RuPay and UPI, both NPCI products, to popularise digital payments benefiting both customers and merchants. There is justification in this prescription by the government because depositors implicitly pay around 3% to banks as net interest margin, being the difference between saving and risk free bond rate, for enjoying certain payments services traditionally. When banks enjoy such a huge amount of current account savings account (CASA) deposits, in return, is it not incumbent on them to provide such payment services, costing only a small fraction of such a gain?

For reasons unknown, the government left out other providers of digital payment products from this MDR prescription, which is unjustified and had adverse effects. Taking advantage of this dichotomy, many issuing banks switched to mainly Visa and Master cards for monetary gains. As customers were induced by such supplier banks, it created a kind of indirect market segmentation and cartel formation, though there is hardly any quality difference in payment products. It may be noted that even the European Central Bank imposed a ceiling on MDR for all, protecting consumer interest. It is hoped that the government will take corrective action in the next Budget to ensure a level playing field and to relieve the NPCI from such policy-induced market imperfection.

Settle the pricing

The ideal pricing for digital payments products should be based on an analysis of producer surplus, consumer surplus (i.e. gain or loss of utility due to pricing) and social welfare for which we need cost-volume-price data. A factor which needs to be reckoned is the float funds digital payments allow (cash withdrawal is a drain on the banking system), which is a source of sizeable income for banks. The RBI will do well to study and arrive at a rational structure of pricing including MDR (possibly also penalty on default by customer), given that the digital payment system is like a national superhighway, for which the government has a crucial role to play in protecting consumers against exploitation. This can run into a huge amount when digital payments become all pervasive.

It is not the intention to deny a fair amount of return to payment service providers including Fin-Tech companies. But should this be at the cost of huge loss of consumer surplus? Ideally, it should be a case of win-win for all.

389,2020/10/22,"Letters to the Editor — October 22, 2020","Words of caution

India is now in “Unlock” mode, and people seem to be assuming that things are back to normal (Page 1, “Virus still around, PM cautions nation”, October 21). Unfortunately, no one seems to care to take the Prime Minister’s appeal seriously, which includes leaders of all political parties who are on campaign mode in the northern States. The less said the better about the general public. As a part of standard operating procedures, there is no effective system to enforce the rules in public as neither civil defence personnel (including NCC cadets) or volunteers are stationed at all hours to make sure people follow protocols. Let us not forget what WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said recently: “There will be a lot of guidance coming out, but I think an average person, a healthy young person, might have to wait until 2022 to get a vaccine.” Indians do need to be cautious.

N. Nagarajan,

Secunderabad

The Prime Minister is right in asking us to be cautious as there seems to be a sense of complacency creeping back into the system. Cases of people throwing caution to wind as they make purchases during the festival season ahead are examples we must be aware of. A lack of safe behaviour during Kerala's Onam festivities is an indicator of what might happen, reversing all the good work done. The Prime Minister and all other authorities concerned need not be mild in their counselling.

Govardhana Myneedu,

Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh

It is amusing to have words of advice from the highest level when every single COVID-19 safety protocol is being violated by almost every political party in election rallies. Is not the tallest leader planning to address many rallies in Bihar, which again runs counter to all dictated norms? He should first advise the political class to set an example and one in which he should play the lead role, before advising the rest of the country.

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,

Faridabad

The Prime Minister would have given us a powerful message in a simple manner. All he had to do was to wear a mask or a face visor while speaking. Indians would have got the point in an instant.

391,2020/10/22,"A peek into Beachville, Chennai’s first roastery cafe","Beachville launches despite the pandemic with a range of experimental coffees, inventive savoury doughnuts and takeaway toffee macchiatos

Just-launched Beachville is a vacation packaged within four walls. And heaven knows the city deserves a holiday getaway, given how 2020 has been going so far.

Inside, the space bustles with a relaxed energy, enhanced by the all encompassing aroma of freshly-ground coffee, a fiesta of floating lights and trays of plump doughnuts. The reassuring hum of customers (many of whom come in for takeaways given the ongoing pandemic) is punctuated by cheery hisses from the espresso machine, set at the heart of the cafe.

Chennai’s first roastery cafe, Beachville’s focus is on enhancing the city’s coffee experience by offering a gamut of services, ranging from personalised grinds to Aeropress classes. The overriding mission, however, is showcasing the flavours and strengths of responsibly-sourced Indian coffee beans.

A part of the country’s new wave of roasters, who focus on technique to celebrate the delicate nuances of Indian beans, Divya Jayashankar launched Beachville Coffee Roasters in 2018.

Previously living in New York, Divya would showcase South Indian filter coffee at Sunday markets and fairs there. This led her to explore roasting techniques. By the time she moved to Chennai, she was so fascinated by the potential of the Indian bean, she decided to build a career on it.

Over a cortado — a creamy blend of fruity espresso drizzled with steamed milk — Divya explains how she believes that coffees have personalitiess.

Influenced by third wave coffee, which considers coffee an artisanal food (enhanced by thoughtful cultivation, processing, roasting and preparation) Divya approaches every roast differently, focussing on bringing out the individuality of each batch.

She is currently roasting Arabica from three of her favourite Indian estates now: Kelangur heights and Gungegiri in Chikmagalur, and Cauvery Peak in Yercaud. “I want a coffee that is sweet and bright. A brew for every mood,” she says, adding that she customises the blends to balance fruitiness with strength. She continues “Filter coffee has been a revelation. With the same beans and different roasts, we can get such a variety of flavours.”

In a bid to encourage customers to experiment, the cafe’s roaster is on view and staff are available to answer questions. In the future, Divya plans to hold classes on brewing techniques and tastings.

Besides the obligatory espressos, cappuccinos and lattes, Beachville also offers a decadent lineup of dessert-style salted caramel affogatos, toffee macchiatos and a surprising iced rose latte.

Restaurateur Sandesh Reddy, who is partnering with Divya on the project, holds up a plate laden with savoury doughnuts, stuffed with Chipotle mushroom, parmesan pink sauce, guacamole and creamy eggs. The sweet versions are as unconventional: strawberry cheesecake, birthday cake, creme brulee, and salted toffee among others. Sandwiches will be added to the menu in a couple of weeks.

With coffee occupying centre stage, the food menu is deliberately minimal.

And if you don’t drink coffee? Well, there is hot chocolate, tea and an unusual compromise, styled like a beach vacation: tropical cappuccinos fiesty with fresh pineapple juice and coconut cream.

Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) chief Raju Shetti said that the Central government must provide 75% of the relief compensation to rain-hit farmers in Maharashtra, while the rest should be provided by the State government.

Mr. Shetti, who had written to the Prime Minister, noted that most of the standing crop across western Marathwada, Konkan and Marathwada region had been affected. “When the pandemic erupted in March, the rural economy was in dire straits…it must be remembered that it was the farmers who strove to ensure consistent food supply throughout the lockdown. While medical and police personnel helped curb the contagion, farmers pulled out all the stops to provide milk, vegetables and other essentials to urban pockets,” said the former MP from Hatkanangale in Kolhapur district.

The SSS chief said this was the Centre’s chance to display its beneficence toward Maharashtra’s farmers whose subsistence has been threatened by the ravages of the retreating monsoon. Mr. Shetti urged the Centre to send a team as quickly as possible.

“Farmers, who were expecting bumper yields owing to good climatic conditions for the better part of the year, now have their hopes dashed…acres and acres of jowar, soybean, cotton have been destroyed. Within a matter of three days, the rains have reduced farmers to the brink of subsistence,” he said.

The farmer leader also expressed disappointment with Uddhav Thackeray’s Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for not having swiftly announced financial assistance. “The crop losses are at a staggering ₹50,000 crore…the Centre must get into the act soon, as must the State government as this is a grave crisis unlike any other,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ooxznz/article32922254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMRAJUSHETTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/centre-must-do-more-to-help-maharashtras-rain-hit-farmers-raju-shetti/article32922256.ece
395,2020/10/22,"Serum Institute of India, IAVI and Merck join forces to develop COVID-19 antibodies","Partners aim to provide potent neutralising antibodies for pandemic response

The city-based Serum Institute of India (SII), along with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), a non-profit scientific research organisation, on Thursday announced an agreement with pharmaceutical major Merck to develop SARS-CoV-2 neutralising monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

Monoclonal antibodies are man-made proteins that act like human antibodies in the immune system. These antibodies are co-invented by IAVI and Scripps Research as ‘innovative interventions’ to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The agreement builds on the advanced antibody discovery and optimisation expertise of IAVI and Scripps Research, gained from years of experience in HIV broadly neutralising antibody research and development, and on Merck’s and Serum Institute’s significant capabilities in design and scale up of accelerated manufacturing processes for mAbs production. The global development plan is being led by the three organizations in partnership,” said a statement issued by the SII.

If the highly potent and broadly cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody candidates being advanced through this partnership are shown to be efficacious in clinical trial (either as a single antibody or a potential combination of both candidates), then Merck will lead commercialisation in developed countries.

396,2020/10/22,Durga Puja goes digital in Mumbai,"Rituals are being streamed on social media platforms

Devotees in Mumbai are celebrating Durga Puja this year from the confines of their homes and taking part in rituals virtually in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This is the first time in 91 years of our Puja heritage that we are having a ceremonial Ghot Pujo instead of a Murti Pujo,” said the organisers of Bombay Durga Bari Samiti, which has been celebrating the festival since 1930. Ghot Pujo essentially means worshipping urns symbolising goddess Durga and her children.

“Keeping the safety of devotees in mind, we have decided to do away with traditional celebrations and honour Maa Durga with Ghot Pujo,” said Susmita Mitra, president of the samiti. All rituals will be conducted at Sangam Hall in Marine Drive and streamed on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, Arunima Bhattacharya, an in-house talent, has created a three-dimensional backdrop of Durga and her children.“We have been celebrating Durga Puja in an environmentally friendly way and hope to continue doing so in the years to come,” said Ms. Mitra. “Durga Puja is the celebration of the victory of good over evil, and one of the greatest challenges we face today is the pandemic and the threat to the world is now greater than ever.”

Jayati Dasgupta, chairperson of the samiti, said, “As an organisation, we have always believed in promoting performing arts and artistes from diverse backgrounds while endeavouring to achieve its philanthropic objectives. Our programmes reflect the cultural ethos of India and meet our objective of furthering national integration.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8uqk5u/article32921952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMProtima-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/durga-puja-goes-digital-in-mumbai/article32921953.ece
397,2020/10/22,Police hunt for couple wanted in cheating case,"The Kamothe police are on lookout for a couple who cheated a retired Mantralaya official of ₹23 lakh.

In his complaint, Bhaskar Chichulkar (62), who retired in 2017 as section officer at the Mantralaya’s Central Director General Office, said a relative introduced him to the accused, Praveen Kamble, in 2018. Mr. Kamble claimed to be an assistant police officer at Taloja jail.

The accused said he ran a business with his wife Sunita Kamble of providing essential goods to canteens at Thane and Kalyan jails.

Mr. Chichulkar paid the accused ₹23 lakh after he promised to get him the tenders to supply bottled water, grains and dry snacks to the canteens. In July 2018, Mr. Chichulkar rented a shop near Thane jail and started providing bottled water to Mr. Kamble’s firm, which supplied it to Thane jail.

In November 2018, Mr. Kamble stopped taking bottled water from Mr. Chichulkar and said a new tender for providing supplies to Thane jail’s canteen would be floated the next month.

Later, when Mr. Kamble started ignoring his calls, Mr. Chichulkar visited his house in Kharghar, but found that the couple had moved out. He learnt that Mr. Kamble’s parents lived in Nerul, but they were not in touch with the accused.

“Prima facie, we have learnt that Mr.Kamble was not associated with Taloja jail. We are verifying if he worked in the police department.

398,2020/10/22,‘Want to avoid political interference in probes’,"Concern over CBI intervening in TRP case: Home Minister

A day after the Maharashtra government withdrew its ‘general consent’ to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases in the State, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday said the decision was taken to prevent possible political interference in the Mumbai Police’s ongoing investigation into the alleged role of three television channels in the Television Rating Points (TRP) scam.

“Henceforth, the CBI will need the Maharashtra government’s permission to probe any case. The agency cannot hold any investigation until sanctioned by the State government,” he said.

The government’s move comes a day after the CBI took over a case registered by the Uttar Pradesh Police against “unknown channels and persons” in the TRP scam. The development led to suspicion that the CBI might also take over the Mumbai Police’s investigation into a similar case.

Mr. Deshmukh recalled the manner in which the probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput was taken over by the CBI despite opposition from the Mumbai Police. He said, “Earlier, the CBI had taken up the investigation in some cases. We are concerned about the CBI being used to intervene in the ongoing TRP scam.”

The minister also recalled that a Supreme Court judge had described the Central agency as a “caged parrot” a few years ago.

Mr. Deshmukh, however, said the government believes the CBI is a premier investigation agency of the country. “The CBI was given a free pass by the earlier government. We have withdrawn it. We thought about political scores being settled through CBI,” he said.

The State Home Department’s order issued on Wednesday said, “In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, the government of Maharashtra hereby withdraws the consent accorded to the Members of the Delhi Special Police Establishment vide Government Order dated February 22, 1989.”

The Mumbai Police had registered an FIR on October 6 against three channels, including Republic TV, for allegedly manipulating TRPs.

Prof. GN Saibaba called off his hunger strike after the DIG (Prisons) visited him in the Nagpur Central Jail and accepted all his demands.

On October 16, 90% physically disabled and wheelchair-bound Saibaba announced that he will be going on hunger strike from October 21 as he has not been provided with clothes, medicines and books for a month.

On Thursday, he called his wife Vasantha Kumari and said the DIG (Prisons) had visited him on October 20 and accepted all his demands. Prof. Saibaba told her that the DIG had instructed the prison officers to resolve all the demands immediately and handover all the confiscated and withheld letters written to him by his wife, family members and advocates.

The Committee for the Defense and Release of Dr. Saibaba released a press statement quoting the DIG Prisons as saying, “The jail authorities shall not stop the medicines given by his family members and advocates and the medicines will be given to him immediately. The complaint letter documenting his harassment and lack of basic rights in the prison since the last few months addressed to the DIG (Prisons) Pune shall be delivered immediately. Previously the jail authorities were not sending this letter and illegally holding it. All the paper clippings sent to him by his family members through post shall be given to him immediately and such paper cuttings shall not be confiscated in future. He shall be provided with books sent by the family members.”

However, DIG Ramesh Kamble told The Hindu, “I visited Saibaba in his cell. He did not have any complaints nor did he mention anything about going on hunger strike. There has been some misunderstanding.”

Ms. Kumari told The Hindu, “Saibaba informed me about the visit by the DIG Prisons on October 20 because of which Sai did not go on hunger strike but none of the demands have been met yet and we wait in hope.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2ozi15/article32920151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GNSAIBABA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/prof-saibaba-calls-off-hunger-strike-after-dig-prisons-accepts-his-demand/article32920152.ece
400,2020/10/22,Bombay HC suspends sentence awarded to Maha minister in assault case,"A sessions court in Amravati on October 15 convicted Thakur and three others in the case and sentenced them to three months imprisonment

The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court on Thursday suspended the three-month sentence awarded to Maharashtra cabinet minister Yashomati Thakur for allegedly assaulting a policeman in Amravati district in 2012.

A sessions court in Amravati on October 15 convicted Thakur, who is the state’s women and child development minister, and three others including her driver, in the case and sentenced them to three months imprisonment.

Thakur, a Congress leader, earlier this week filed an appeal in the high court against the conviction and sought suspension of the sentence by way of interim relief, pending final hearing of her plea.

The plea also sought for the conviction to be stayed.

“Bare perusal of the evidence of the witnesses clearly shows that the sessions court committed an error by convicting the appellant (Thakur). There is no case made out for conviction,” the minister’s advocates Subodh Dharmadhikari and Aniket Nikam argued.

Justice Vinay Joshi on Thursday admitted the appeal and suspended the sentence. He posted the appeal for further hearing on October 27.

“The appellant has been awarded a sentence of three months. Having regard to the quantum of the sentence, its execution needs to be suspended,” Justice Joshi said.

According to the prosecution, the incident took place on March 24, 2012, in the Chunabhatti area under Rajapeth police station limits in Amravati when Thakur, then an MLA, was moving in her vehicle along with her aides.

According to the charge sheet, Thakur, her driver Sagar Suresh Khandekar, and party workers Sharad Kashirav Jawanjal and Raju Kisan Ingle, allegedly beat up traffic policeman Ulhas Raurale when he stopped her vehicle from entering a one-way lane.

Thakur is currently the guardian minister of Amravati district.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/uviid1/article32768964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MH-HC-RECRUITMEGPB7QST104jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-suspends-sentence-awarded-to-maha-minister-in-assault-case/article32916492.ece

402,2020/10/22,Court refuses ad interim relief to Hansa Group against Republic TV,"The Group has sought restraining orders against the channel to air any details of report on TRPs by BARC

In a temporary relief to the Republic TV Group, a city civil and sessions court on Wednesday refused to grant ad interim relief to the Hansa Research Group seeking restraining orders against the channel to air any details of report on Television Rating Points (TRPs) by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC).

The Hansa Research Group filed a suit against ARG Outlier Media Private Limited and owner and editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami. The suit sought a permanent injunction order restraining the channel from broadcasting any internal document. The suit also sought a temporary injunction pending the final disposal of the suit restraining the channel to broadcast the report.

The plaint states that the BARC commissioned Hansa in 2014 to be part of TV Audience Measurement Process by installing ‘Bar-o-meters’ viz electronic meters to capture who is watching which channel. Since the tariffs for advertisement are based on viewership data, there are instances that certain channels attempt to manipulate their viewership data.”

The plaint mentions, “In order to overcome this misuse, the vigilance team of BARC and the plaintiff are constantly monitoring for any wrong-doing to influence viewers to watch a particular channel to boost the viewership data of that channel. During investigations by the vigilance team of BARC with Hansa it was found that Vishal Bhandari, former employee of Hansa, was inducing viewers to watch particular channels. Hence, deputy general manager Nitin Deokar filed a complaint on October 6.”

Internal document

The plea adds, “It appears that the said internal document prepared by Hansa, which was a draft internal document which was not shown to or approved by the Chief Executive Officer of the company for the purposes of filing the said police complaint, could have been accessed by the channel without permission or consent and telecast as ‘Hansa Report’.”

The suit states, “After the announcement by the Commissioner of Police on the TRP scam, Mr. Goswami referred to the particular document, showed parts and portions of the document on the screen again and again, and claimed that the name of Republic TV was not mentioned in the said report but the name of some other channel was there.”

The matter will be heard on November 21.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4tb0b8/article32860344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARNABGOSWAMIATPOLICESTATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/court-refuses-ad-interim-relief-to-hansa-group-against-republic-tv/article32912276.ece

404,2020/10/22,BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé launched,"BMW has launched its smallest four-door sedan, the 2 Series Gran Coupé, in India with prices starting at ₹39.30 lakh (ex-showroom, India). BMW has chosen to launch the model with just a diesel engine for now; a petrol powertrain is expected later. The 2 Series Gran Coupé sports a typical, new-age BMW look with the front fascia dominated by a bold kidney grille and raked headlamps with double-barrel LED signatures. The profile is in line with larger Gran Coupés with a sloping roofline that ends in a fastback-like rear section with a heavily sculpted boot lid and slim ‘L-shaped’ LED tail lamps. Inside, the cabin too is in line with other new BMWs with a neatly laid out dash, large central touchscreen and a digital instrument cluster. Equipment on offer includes cruise control, paddle shifters, auto headlamps, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control, powered front seats, a rear-view camera, six airbags, ABS, ESC, traction control and more.

Unlike other BMW sedans, which feature a longitudinal engine layout and rear-wheel drive set-up, the 2 Series Gran Coupé gets a transverse engine and front-wheel drive configuration.

For now, BMW has launched the model in the 220d guise, with a 190hp, 400Nm, 2.0-litre, four-cylinder, diesel engine mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox. A 192hp 2.0-litre, turbo-petrol 220i is expected to join the line-up at a later date.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/2cjdxb/article32913248.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21MPBMW2SeriesGranCoupelaunchedjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/bmw-2-series-gran-coup-launched/article32913249.ece

407,2020/10/22,Honda Hornet 2.0: Sportier with a bigger engine and new chassis,"While the overall silhouette is similar, most of the body panels have been changed for India

Honda’s new Hornet 2.0 is not just a replacement with incremental improvements, it also gets a bigger engine along with a new chassis and the promise of a sportier character.The Hornet 2.0 is based on the international-spec Honda CB190R, but with plenty of changes. While the overall silhouette is similar, most of the body panels have been changed for India.

The LED headlamp is redone while the gold-coloured USD fork is unique in this segment. A new engine cowl also adds to the sporty stance. With its larger tank extensions, the body looks taut and muscular but the tank still holds the same 12 litres of fuel. The ignition key slot is now placed at the front of the fuel tank. A new split-seat set-up creates a sportier appearance, and the quarter panels at the rear have a more interesting design.

Facing the rider is a negative LCD display with five levels of adjustable brightness, two trip meters, a battery voltage meter and a gear-position indicator. However, the side plastic panels felt a little flimsy and the body-coloured mirrors are quite tacky. The riding position is upright; the seat height is decent and should suit riders of most sizes.

Specifications Engine 184.4cc, single-cylinder, fuel-injected

Max Power 17.3hp at 8500rpm

Max Torque 16.1Nm at 6000rpm

Gearbox 5-speed

L/W/H 2047/783/1064mm

Wheelbase 1355mm

Weight 142kg

Ground Clearance 167mm

Fuel Tank Capacity 12 litres

Brakes (F|R) 276mm disc| 220mm disc

Front Suspension USD fork

Rear Suspension Monoshock

Front Tyre 110/70-17

Rear Tyre 140/70-17

This is certainly a sportier looking motorcycle than the one it replaces, and it now has a bigger engine to back that up. Displacing 184.4cc, this fuel-injected engine is not only 22cc up on the old bike but also produces more power and torque. However, it is quite a simple two-valve, air-cooled, SOHC unit that has the same smooth feel and whiny intake sound that is typical of small-capacity Hondas.

Peak power is rated at 8,500rpm and you do feel the engine starting to get a little flat above this. Nevertheless, the engine pulls cleanly from low revs, and there is a nice surge that develops when you cross 6,000rpm. Midrange performance is clearly the goal and the Hornet 2.0 feels punchy at moderate speeds. The 5-speed gearbox is smooth and light as is the clutch action, and you will appreciate both within the city. Honda has also kept the gearing quite short and the engine doesn’t mind low speeds in higher gears.

The Hornet 2.0 handles better than any 150 or 160cc Honda commuter motorcycle that has come before. The suspension set-up isn’t soft and soggy like most Honda 160cc machines. While the ride quality isn’t harsh, it is not plush either... especially over rough roads, but there is plenty of ground clearance, so you won’t have to worry about potholes.

What comes as a surprise is how quickly the new Hornet wants to lean into corners. The low 142kg kerb weight helps, but this bike is eager to change direction and the fact that it now runs fatter tyres than before has had no negative effect on its agility. Perhaps, the only thing that still feels a little too soft is the bite from the front disc brake, as the lever needs a hard pull to slow down in a hurry.

At ₹1.27 lakh (ex-showroom), the Hornet costs just ₹1,500 less than the TVS Apache RTR 200 and about ₹2,700 less than the Bajaj Pulsar NS 200. It’s refreshing that Honda hasn’t simply made another humdrum commuter with fancy bodywork.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/xlf585/article32913062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21MPHornet2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/honda-hornet-20-sportier-with-a-bigger-engine-and-new-chassis/article32913064.ece
408,2020/10/22,"Audi Q2: Part-SUV, part-hatch, pure thrills","With chiselled good looks and an engine that loves to rev, the Q2 has got the compact luxury crossover balance just right

A size smaller than the likes of the BMW X1, the Q2 is part-SUV, part-large hatchback and the brand’s smallest Q model globally. So, what is it like on our roads?

The Q2’s design is quite forward-looking and it boasts of Audi’s understated demeanour in spades, be it the shoulder and roofline or the gently bulging wheel arches. There is also the wide rectangular nose with its multiple trapezoidal details. The flanks look like they have been worked on with a giant chisel; the sharp cuts and ridges look especially nice when catching the light. The ‘T’ shaped pattern in the headlights and tail-lights also work well.

Inside, there is more than sufficient space, the seats are extremely supportive and comfortable. But there is no power adjustment and touch screen: two shocking omissions.

The slightly elevated driving position feels just right. Visibility is superb, and the dash does not seem to be in your face either. The quality of the soft-top dash and the fit and finish of the various chrome elements make this a cabin you want to touch and feel all the time. The flat-bottom steering wheel feels great to hold and the knurled metallic knobs and dials are also a delight to use. You also get Audi’s Virtual Cockpit: the configurable, fully digital instrument panel, a wireless charging tray in the elbow box and a big sunroof too. Rear visibility, however, is poor.

Specifications Length 4318mm

Width 1805mm

Height 1548mm

Wheelbase 2595mm

Kerb weight 1505kg

Boot capacity 355 litres

Engine 1984cc, 4-cyls, turbo-petrol

Power 190hp at 4200-6000rpm

Torque 320Nm at 1500-4180rpm

Gearbox 7-speed dual-clutch automatic

Headroom is decent, there is surplus knee room and since you can put your feet under the front seats, you can even stretch out a bit. The seat base is short and the backrest is a bit upright, meaning long drives might get a bit uncomfortable.

The Q2 also conjures up plenty of thrills for the driver. A lot of this is down to its 190hp power output, and its 2.0-litre engine, which is one of the best four-cylinder engines around.

Idle is vibration-free and refined, the response is immediate and does not feel turbocharged. There is no sudden spike in power when the boost comes in, but there is still a clear ramp up after 2,000rpm and all the way to the 6,200rpm redline. There is an enthusiasm here that you would normally find only in a naturally aspirated engine, and though the acceleration does not quite throw you back in your seat, performance is still very urgent.

The Q2 comes with a dual-clutch gearbox, which is quick on the draw during regular driving. However, what takes away from the driving experience is that, at times, it can be reluctant to shift down. This happens just when you need it most — like when you need to brake, downshift and get into a corner — and that can be quite frustrating.

What is impressive is a suspension that rides silently over bad patches of road. While it is fairly absorbent, there is some amount of stiffness and this shows up over some of the sharper-edged bumps. Also, there is a bit of roll in corners but body control in general is very good. Since there is plenty of grip, you can put the power down quite nicely too. The steering could do with a bit more feedback though; the Q2 begins to understeer if you push harder. Still, the driving experience in general is pleasing and this is a car you just love to drive quickly, be it in a straight line or around a series of nicely meandering corners. The Q2 also comes with a transverse engine, a front-biased setup, and an on-demand AWD system based on a multi-plate clutch.

With prices ranging between ₹34.99 and ₹48.89 lakh (ex-showroom), the Q2 is certainly pricey, and is targeted at self-driven owners who want a compact luxury crossover with good performance, everyday useability and a high-quality cabin.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/cwvy74/article32912727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21MPAudi5JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/audi-q2-part-suv-part-hatch-pure-thrills/article32912729.ece
409,2020/10/22,Answering your vehicle-related queries,"ECU kit for Honda Civic diesel

Raahul Suresh, Tiruchi: I plan on buying the new Honda Civic diesel. I liked the way it handled, but it didn’t feel as swift as older models. Is it a good idea to add an ECU kit to the new model or modify the engine?

You could add a piggyback ECU to drive an aggressive map as per your liking or get a remap done to extract maximum performance from the 1.6-litre iDTEC engine. However, none of these are recommended on a brand-new car as you would stand the risk of losing the warranty on the entire vehicle after modification. Hence, if performance is your top priority, we would suggest investing elsewhere, but you have fairly limited choices in this car segment.

Looking to upgrade

B Rathish, Sholinghur: I own a 2018 Tata Hexa XTA but would like to upgrade to a better one. Which one do you recommend?

The Hexa is the best Tata product but it has been discontinued. There is no replacement for it, and we suggest you hang onto your Hexa. You could wait for the Tata Gravitas which also has three rows but, it won’t be as comfortable. Another option is the Ford Endeavour, but it is more expensive.

410,2020/10/22,New Puducherry SEC was chosen from among ten candidates,"The new Puducherry State Election Commissioner Roy P. Thomas was selected from among ten candidates who had applied for the post.

A panel consisting of Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar, Advisor, Union Territory, Ministry of Home Affairs Jitendra Agarwal and Director Ministry of Panchayati Raj S. S Prasad oversaw the selection process, a senior official told The Hindu.

Among those who had applied included a few retired IAS, IPS and IFS officers who had served in UT in different capacities, details accessed by The Hindu revealed.

“The entire selection process was based on candidates' work experience, background and professional commitment. The three member panel conducted the interview and scrutinised the applications,” said the official.

Mr. Thomas, who hails from Kerala, is currently serving as a consultant in the Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change in New Delhi.

Prior to that, he had served in Government of Kerala as conservator of forests and in various other capacities. He has got experience in conducting Parliament, Assembly and Local Body elections, said the official.

As per the order issued by Under Secretary to Government Giddi Balaram on Wednesday, the SEC appointment would be for a period of three years or till he attains the age of 68, whichever is earlier.

Meanwhile, Mr Roy took charge on Wednesday afternoon and, soon thereafter, issued a circular saying “all official, demi-official letters and confidential communication intended to the State Election Commissioner, Puducherry may kindly be henceforth addressed to him.” His office would function from the Election Department Complex at Reddiyarpalayam, said an official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/l4ymm4/article32916529.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LGSEC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/new-puducherry-sec-was-chosen-from-among-ten-candidates/article32917453.ece
411,2020/10/22,"Puducherry Lieutenant Governor welcomes SEC appointment, said local body elections soon","Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy termed the appointment of SEC as “illegal”.

Lt Governor Kiran Bedi on Thursday said with the appointment of State Election Commissioner the Union Territory would soon have panchayat elections.

In a message to media, she said the UT would soon have grassroot democracy. “In 2018, the Supreme Court directed to hold election within four months and sternly warned that no delay can be brooked. The government was committing contempt of court by not holding elections. Vested interests did not want civic body elections and hence cast all obstacles,” she said.

The last local body election was held 10 years ago, she said adding with local self governance in place UT would be eligible to get more Central funds.

“Puducherry is gradually transitioning towards self governance more now with panchayat elections. More funds will come from Government of India. Funds were not coming since we did not have elected bodies,” the Lt Governor said.

The elections would be an opportunity for true social workers and activists who want to see change and transformation, she said.

State Election Commissioner Roy P. Thomas also called on the Lt Governor at Raj Nivas. Secretary Local Administration Jayant Kumar Ray and Officer on Special Duty G. Thevas Neethi Dhas were also present.

SEC appointment “illegal”

Terming the appointment of the State Election Commissioner retired IFS officer Roy P. Thomas as “illegal,” Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Thursday said the government has not yet completed the legal process in challenging the initiative taken by Lt Governor in the appointment process of SEC.

“We are in the process of challenging the HC order in the SC. Because of COVID-19 the process got delayed,” Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy told The Hindu.

The Madras High Court had dismissed a writ petition filed by Minister for Local Administration A. Namassivayam challenging the Lieutenant Governor’s decision to reject the nominee of the cabinet for the SEC post. The court had upheld decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs and Lt Governor to call for advertisement in the SEC selection process.

Mr. Narayanasamy said when the file for Mr Thomas’s appointment came to his office he had questioned the decision. “The appointment was based on a notification which was annulled by the Legislative Assembly. How could the appointment be made on the basis of a notification quashed by the Speaker. I wanted the Legal Department to examine the issue but my concerns were completely ignored. It is a unilateral decision taken after bypassing a democratically elected government,” the Chief Minister said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/l4ymm4/article32916529.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LGSEC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-lieutenant-governor-welcomes-sec-appointment-said-local-body-elections-soon/article32916530.ece

413,2020/10/22,Aruvikkara plant clears BIS water quality test,"KIIDC plans to market water under its own ‘Hilly Aqua’ bottled water brand name

The bottled drinking water plant at Aruvikkara has finally cleared the water quality test of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), paving the way for the launch of much-delayed commercial operations.

The Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation (KIIDC), the Irrigation Department agency that now manages the ₹16-crore facility, is now awaiting the formal issue of the BIS certification. It will enable KIIDC to obtain clearance from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). which too is required to commercially market the bottled water.

“Initially, we hope to launch 20-litre jars in the market in the first week of November in collaboration with Kudumbashree,” a senior KIIDC official said. It plans to market the water under its own ‘Hilly Aqua’ bottled water brand name.

Water quality tests performed after KIIDC took over the facility from the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) had failed BIS tests on account of fungi presence in the water. KIIDC had taken steps to rectify the problem and a second inspection was carried out by a BIS team on October 12.

Although the KWA completed the construction of the 7,200 litres-per-hour facility in 2018, the government-run water utility was unable to obtain the BIS certification owing to technical problems. Subsequently, the government had decided, much to the chagrin of the KWA trade unions, to hand over the facility to KIIDC, which markets the Hilly Aqua brand.

Govt. pumps in ₹2 cr. more

Meanwhile, the State government is pumping in an additional ₹2 crore to get the bottled drinking water plant at Aruvikkara up and running. The Water Resources Department has issued orders sanctioning the money to the KIIDC “to operationalise the bottled water plant in a time-bound manner.”

The plant has already cost the government ₹16 crore. But on takeover, the KIIDC had encountered several technical glitches that needed rectification.

In July, the Managing Director, KIIDC, informed the government that the KIIDC had scant budgetary support and the expenditure for the Aruvikkara facility was being met from KIIDC funds. It has spent approximately ₹20 lakh on rectifying technical issues at the plant, a senior official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/aruvikkara-plant-clears-bis-water-quality-test/article32919042.ece

The Pothencode block panchayat is setting an example by transforming a disused quarry into a water source for the public.

Some time ago, it was discovered that the Chitikkara quarry spread over 4.5 acres had a spring at a depth of 200 ft.

After the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) certified that the water is fit for drinking, the block panchayat authorities launched measures to collect the water, purify and supply it.

Two tanks having a capacity of 5,000 litres each were installed along with three filters.

419,2020/10/22,Latest tech to improve Secretariat security,"Move follows fire outbreak, trespass by agitators

Latest technology will be used for regulating entry and exit, issuing passes to visitors, and for ensuring fire safety as part of revamping security at the Secretariat.

The move comes in the wake of the August fire in the Secretariat and a few incidents of trespass by agitators who scaled the iron railings of the boundary wall.

After the fire in August, the Cabinet had tasked Additional Chief Secretary, Home, T.K. Jose to improve security at the Secretariat. The government had also wanted steps to improve the perimeter security of the building and better vetting of visitors.

Panels formed

The Chief Secretary will head the five-member high-level Secretariat Security Committee that will look into revamping the present arrangements. The Additional Chief Secretary, Home and Vigilance; the Additional Chief Secretary, Finance; the Principal Secretary, GAD; and the State Police Chief will be the members.

In line with the government directive, Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta has set up a four-member high-level committee to suggest and implement measures to revamp the security. The Principal Secretary, General Administration, will be the chairman of this implementation committee. Principal Secretary, PWD; Secretary, Home and Vigilance; and the District Police Chief, Thiruvananthapuram City; will be the members.

The committee has been asked to suggest all measures and technological installations for revamping security. The government has issued formal orders constituting both the committees.

‘A fire risk’

The fire safety practices at the Secretariat were subjected to audit by the Electrical Inspectorate and the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority after the August blaze, though the investigators are yet to find out the reason. The Fire and Rescue Department had earlier found the 19th century vintage building a fire risk.

The area under coconut cultivation in the State will be expanded from the present 7 lakh hectares to 9 lakh hectares, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar has said.

The Minister was speaking after inaugurating the ‘Keragramam’ project in the Vattiyurkavu Assembly constituency on Wednesday.

For promoting the cultivation of coconut, the State government is implementing ‘Kera Keralam Sammrudha Keralam,’ a comprehensive project which will be implemented over a 10-year period. A total of 45% of the coconut yield under this programme will go into the manufacture of high-quality value-added products. The State government will provide the technical expertise for this programme.

In 250 ha

Coconut cultivation will be promoted in 250 ha falling under the Vattiyurkavu and Kudappanakkunnu Krishi Bhavan limits under the ‘Keragramam’ project.

Farmers stand to benefit from a total of ₹67.5 lakh mobilised from the plan funds of the Agriculture Department and the city Corporation.

A second component, worth ₹25 lakh, will be available to groups and individuals via the Small Farmers’ Agri-Business Consortium (SFAC) for entrepreneurship in value-added products from coconut. Diseased, low-yielding and old coconut palms will be replaced with new ones under the project. Lime, organic fertilizer and pesticide will be distributed at subsidised cost.

422,2020/10/22,Fronts set the ball rolling for Corpn. polls,"LDF to finalise contenders in a week, BJP aims to capture power, UDF talks from October 23

The announcement of reserved wards in the city Corporation for the upcoming local body elections has set off speculations regarding the candidates for each ward.

Discussions have begun at the booth level in all fronts for possible candidates, with multiple contenders cropping up for some parties in some wards.

The contest will be keenly watched due to the unexpected result in the 2015 elections when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had increased its tally from 6 to 34 wards, mostly at the expense of the United Democratic Front (UDF), which went down from 42 to 21.

The questions regarding candidate selection within the UDF raised then have now been revived, according to UDF sources.

KC(M)’s exit

The recent shift of the Kerala Congress (M) from the UDF to the Left Democratic Front (LDF) has freed up two seats within the UDF.

Although the seats are expected to be handed over to the Joseph group, several contenders have come forward from the Congress for the Poonthura ward, where the sitting councillor is with the Joseph group.

“We have asked the constituents to put forward their requests, which we will get in two days. Detailed talks will be held from October 23. The final decisions regarding the Corporation, district panchayat and block panchayats will be taken at the district level,” said Beemapally Rasheed, UDF district convener.

For the ruling LDF, KC(M)’s arrival raises the question of the wards which the CPI(M) and the CPI will have to give up. Discussions have begun at the CPI(M) district committee for its candidates.

Mayor candidates

The names of two or three possible contenders for the Mayor post, reserved for woman, are in the air. The LDF, according to sources, is expected to bring in a few fresh, young faces, with those who have contested more than two or three times making way, except in a handful of cases.

“The names will be finalised in a week. An understanding has almost been reached within the LDF regarding the seats to be set aside for the new party joining the front,” said CPI(M) district secretary Anavoor Nagappan.

The BJP, which had recently suffered a jolt when one of its councillors quit the party and joined the CPI(M), is looking to consolidate the unexpected gains it made in 2015.

Winnable persons

The winners are making a strong pitch for seats, while the party is scrutinising their performance and chances of a repeat win before taking a final decision.

“The booth-level discussions have begun. The suggestions from there will be passed on to the higher levels up to the district. For us, there are many factors to consider, but the ultimate factor will be whether the candidate is winnable. Our aim this time is to capture power in the Corporation,” said M.R.

424,2020/10/22,Stuttering Real seeks Clasico response,"Knives may well be out for Zidane if he fails to get a win at Barcelona

Real Madrid won LaLiga only three months ago because of its defensive steel and a relentless will to win but ahead of Saturday’s Clasico against Barcelona, it appears to be a team unravelling.

After losing 1-0 at home to Cadiz for the first time in its history last weekend, Madrid fell 3-2 in the Champions League on Wednesday to Shakhtar Donetsk, which had 10 first team players and nine staff missing due to coronavirus infections. “We lacked a bit of everything but above all our confidence, which is the most important thing,” said Zinedine Zidane.

It means it might not be a vintage Clasico this weekend but for Madrid it has become more important now, and for Zidane too.

Two defeats in a week is one thing but three, the last of them against Barcelona, would the alter the dynamic.

425,2020/10/22,"Real Madrid beaten again, Bayern surges in Champions League","Real Madrid has been unconvincing, especially at home, in the Champions League.

Real Madrid couldn’t halt its losing streak in the Champions League, and no one seems able to stop Bayern Munich’s winning run.

Madrid’s 3-2 loss to a depleted Shakhtar Donetsk team was the most surprising result of Wednesday’s opening group games - while Bayern delivered the most impressive performance with a 4-0 win over Atlştico Madrid.

It was a third straight loss in the competition for Real Madrid - its worst run in 34 years. For defending champion Bayern, it was a 12th straight Champions League victory.

Wins for Liverpool and Manchester City capped a good round for English clubs, and Atalanta again showed its free-scoring style to win 4-0 at overmatched newcomer Midtjylland.

Real Madrid has been unconvincing, especially at home, in the Champions League since lifting a record-extending 13th European title three seasons ago.

Yet Shakhtar was missing several starters after a COVID-19 outbreak at the club. The Ukrainian champion still led 3-0 at halftime, exposing a Madrid defense missing injured captain Sergio Ramos.

“It’s my job to find solutions because these kind of games can’t happen,” said coach Zinedine Zidane, who left veterans Toni Kroos and Karim Benzema on the bench ahead of playing Barcelona on Saturday.

Few fans attended the eight games, because of the spiking coronavirus infections across Europe, and there were none at Olympiakos to see a stoppage-time goal earn a 1-0 win over Marseille.

Only 1,000 were at San Siro to see Romelu Lukaku score in his ninth straight European game, including a 90th minute equalizer, to help Inter Milan draw 2-2 with Borussia MŮnchengladbach.

Fading power

Since Real Madrid’s last Champions League title in 2018, the club and president Florentino Perez have been linked with plans to create more elitist competitions that would avoid facing so many lower-ranked teams from countries like Ukraine.

Shakhtar is a group-stage regular, and moved on to the Europa League semifinals in August, though was missing several of its Brazilian contingent against Madrid.

Goals from TetŠ and Manor Solomon either side of an own goal by Madrid defender Raphael Varane came in a 13-minute spell before halftime.

Madrid hit back with Luka Modric’s long-range shot in the 54th and minutes later substitute Vinţcius JŴnior, who entered and ran direct from the touchline to steal possession and score.

Madrid has now won just one of its last seven home games in the Champions League, including a 2-1 first-leg loss to Manchester City in the round of 16 in February.

This one was played at Madrid’s empty training ground while the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium is renovated.

Also in Group B, an Inter team also affected by a virus outbreak, drew 2-2 with MŮnchengladbach.

After a goalless first half, Lukaku scored early and late in the second for last season’s Europa League runner-up. MŮnchengladbach had taken a 2-1 lead when Jonas Hoffman’s goal in the 84th was confirmed after a video review lasting several minutes.

Bayern surges

The champion in Lisbon two months ago, Bayern carried over its dominant European form in a 4-0 dismantling of Atlştico. Kingsley Coman, scorer of the title-winning goal against Paris Saint-Germain, netted twice.

The game went ahead after a further round of testing of Bayern players on Wednesday, one day after forward Serge Gnabry’s COVID-19 infection was revealed.

Also in Group A, Salzburg was held 2-2 at home by Lokomotiv Moscow.

English wins

Man City started a competition it was originally banned from by UEFA with a 3-1 win at home Porto.

City trailed early, then leveled from Sergio Aguero’s penalty kick awarded for a foul against Porto’s veteran captain Pepe. Ilkay Gundogan and Ferran Torres secured the win midway through the second half.

Liverpool and Ajax have a combined 10 European titles yet had not faced each other in Amsterdam since 1966.

A 1-0 win for Liverpool was decided by Sadio Mane’s shot in the 35th forcing an own goal from defender Nicolŕs Tagliafico.

The English champion handled the absence of injured Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk, and some anxious moments with back-up goalkeeper Adrian.

Liverpool moved midfielder Fabinho into central defense and he made a spectacular goal-line clearance to deny Dusan Tadic.

Few fans

A fresh wave of the pandemic across Europe meant storied clubs Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Ajax, Manchester City and Olympiakos could not let fans in their stadiums.

Midtjylland recorded an attendance of 132 for its Champions League group-stage debut.

426,2020/10/22,UEFA warns against breakaway league,"Denounces the idea as ‘boring’ and says the principles of solidarity, open leagues are non-negotiable

UEFA has warned of the damage that would be caused to football by the potential creation of a European Super League of the continent’s elite clubs, potentially usurping its existing Champions League.

UEFA, the European governing body, denounced the idea as “boring” after FIFA did not deny taking part in talks about creating a rival league featuring the continent’s wealthiest clubs.

In a statement, FIFA did not push back on a Sky News report that it was developing plans for an 18-team annual European Premier League. Such a competition would directly challenge UEFA and potentially undermine its existing Champions League.

UEFA is already involved in talks about potential adjustments to the Champions League format and qualification path from 2024 and strongly resists breakaway threats.

“The principles of solidarity, of promotion, relegation and open leagues are non-negotiable,” UEFA said in a statement on Tuesday.

Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is one of the driving forces of the reported European Premier League, which Sky said could have $6 billion in debt financing from J.P. Morgan. A carefully worded response from FIFA stands in contrast to recent public comments that have forcibly and clearly denied reports it disputes.

“FIFA does not wish to comment and participate in any speculation about topics which come up every now and then,” the Zurich-based governing body said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/6kkj7t/article32911954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22PEREZ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/uefa-warns-against-breakaway-league/article32911955.ece
427,2020/10/22,United’s Rashford sinks PSG again,"Barca sends out a strong message; Chelsea-Sevilla in listless draw

Marcus Rashford once again sank Paris Saint-Germain after netting the decisive goal in a 2-1 Champions League win in the French capital, while Barcelona sent a message with a thumping 5-1 victory over Ferencvaros.

Rashford, who scored the winning spot-kick when United knocked PSG out in 2019, drilled home a low shot three minutes from the end which won a thrilling Group H contest at a near-empty Parc des Princes.

United had taken the lead in the 23rd minute when Bruno Fernandes slotted home from the spot at the second attempt, but Anthony Martial inexplicably headed Neymar’s corner into his own net 10 minutes after the break.

Ronald Koeman got his first Champions League campaign as Barcelona coach off to a winning start with a confident win over Ferencvaros.

The Hungarians, the first team from their country to make the group stage in 11 years, started brightly and even had the ball in the net via Tokmac Nguen only for the powerful 12th-minute strike to be ruled out for offside.

Messi won and converted the penalty to give the Catalans a 27th-minute lead and the match was as good as done when Ansu Fati clipped home Frenkie de Jong’s sumptuous pass just before the break.

Red for Pique

Philippe Coutinho lashed home the third before Ihor Kharatin pulled one back from the penalty spot after Gerard Pique was sent off for pulling back Nguen as he charged towards goal.

Pique’s red card means he will miss next week’s game away at Juventus, a greater test of Barca’s capabilities.

Pedri and Ousmane Dembele finished the scoring for the 10-man host as it took control of Group G, finishing the opening round top but level on points with Juve.

Andrea Pirlo’s side looked comfortable in its 2-0 win at Dynamo Kiev in what was the Juve coach’s first ever Champions League match in the dugout, with Alvaro Morata scoring twice to take the points for the Italians.

Chelsea is still waiting for a £220 million spending spree to pay off as it began its campaign with an uninspiring 0-0 Group E draw with Sevilla at Stamford Bridge.

The results: Group E: Chelsea 0 drew with Sevilla 0; Rennes 1 (Guirassy 86-pen) drew with Krasnodar 1 (Ramirez 59).

Group F: Lazio (ITA) 3 (Immobile 6, Hitz 23-og, Akpa Akpro 76) bt Borussia Dortmund 1 (Haaland 71); Zenit St-Petersburg 1 (Horvath 74-og) lost to Club Brugge 2 (Bonaventure 63, De Ketelaere 90+3).

Group G: Barcelona 5 (Messi 27-pen, Fati 42, Coutinho 52, Pedri 82, Dembele 89) bt Ferencvaros 1 (Kharatin 70-pen); Dynamo Kiev 0 lost to Juventus 2 (Morata 46, 84).

It was mainly to highlight the sufferings of the traders, who operate from G. Corner and other places after the closure of Gandhi Market from March 27. The hearing on the case against the reopening of Gandhi Market had been slated for October 28 in the Madurai bench of Madras High Court. The State government should file an affidavit to reopen the Gandhi Market. To press the demand for reopening the market, all vegetable, flower and fruits traders in Tiruchi would shut their business.

“We apprehend that the Tiruchi district administration is favouring the litigant. It should respect the sentiments of nearly 2,500 traders. The Gandhi Market should be opened immediately. We hope that the State government would respect the sentiments of traders. It should take sincere steps to vacate the interim injunction so as to reopen the market,” Mr. Govindarajulu said.

430,2020/10/22,Transfer of Oyamari crematorium to a private contractor flayed,"Tiruchi

Citizens’ groups in Tiruchi have raised concerns over transfer of the Oyamari crematorium by the Tiruchi City Corporation to a private contractor and written to the Chief Minister’s Cell seeking his intervention.

The maintenance of the Oyamari crematorium which is managed by the civic body, is to be transferred to a private society after they improve the infrastructure of the facility, senior officials said. “The private organisation has agreed to redevelop the grounds, at a cost of ₹3 crore, after which they will charge ₹3,000 to cremate a body,” S. Sivasubramanian, City Corporation Commissioner told The Hindu.

However, a section of citizens claims that the shift was unnecessary. “The civic body could use the funds to improve infrastructure in the city, improve roads or even construct some parks in the area. We do not need to spend ₹3,000 for a cremation,” said M. Sekaran, Chairman, Citizens’ Forum.

Mr. Sekaran said that many residents in the city would not be able to afford the high costs for cremation. “Amount of ₹1,500, which is being charged by the civic body is already too high,” he said. “There were several problems earlier when a private contractor had been maintaining the grounds. We do not want the issues to surface again,” he added.

Meanwhile, the road leading to the crematorium and the surrounding area is in a sorry state, he said. One of the two furnaces at the cremation grounds too is not functional. “If the civic body wishes to improve the infrastructure, they may do so on their own. It is the duty of a civic body to ensure provision for burial and cremation grounds,” he said.

Mr. Sekaran has also written to the Chief Minister’s Cell seeking his intervention on the matter. “I have written asking them to dissuade the City Corporation Commissioner from transferring the operations,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/transfer-of-oyamari-crematorium-to-a-private-contractor-flayed/article32919590.ece
431,2020/10/22,Is it curtains for some engineering colleges in Tiruchi region?,"Continuation of at least six self-financed engineering colleges in Anna University’s Tiruchi region hinges on the extent of admission of students in the fourth round of Tamil Nadu Engineering Counselling for which the provisional allotment will be published on October 28, it is learnt.

Barring the Anna University- BIT Campus in Tiruchi, several seats in the counselling process were not filled in most of the other colleges in the region in the earlier three rounds of counselling. The trend of admission has not been encouraging in the University's four constituent colleges as well - at Tirukuvalai in Nagapattinam district, Panrutti in Cuddalore district, Pattukottai in Thanjavur district, and in Ariyalur district, sources said.

Colleges in Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Cuddalore districts come under Anna Unviersity's Tiruchi region.

A number of self-financing colleges reportedly bank on the scholarship accruing from the admission of first-generation and Scheduled Caste students. The practice of these colleges has been to identify potential candidates early on and guide them to make their choices in the counselling process. A first-generation graduate is entitled to a scholarship to the tune of ₹ 20,000 per year, and an SC student gets as much as ₹ 70,000 per year, under various heads. However, some of the colleges have not been able to mobilise these categories of students also.

In recent years, one engineering college was closed due to lack of patronage and another is on the verge of closure. In the absence of admissions, it is mandatory for the colleges to apply for Progressive Closure. Only the existing students will permitted to complete the course.

Unlike in previous years, the number of students with good cut-off marks has also been low this year. For instance, there were only 12,263 students for the first round of counselling with cut-off between 199.667 and 175. Likewise, there were only about 23,000 students who had qualified for the second round of counselling with cut-off between 174.75 and 145.5. Last year, there were about 35,000 students in the second round of counselling.

Most of the seats in the self-financing colleges in central districts had hoped to fill the seats this year only in the third and fourth rounds of counselling, sources said.

According to a functionary of a private college management, institutions cannot sustain without proper admissions for two continuous years.

On an average, an engineering college requires not less than ₹ 25 lakh per month to cover costs of salaries, electricity, consumables, and other expenditure, leave alone the money required to service bank loans. In the absence of admissions, closure becomes inevitable, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/is-it-curtains-for-some-engineering-colleges-in-tiruchi-region/article32919517.ece

It is the only district in the central region to report more than the State average. Perambalur district turned out to be the least infected district with just 1.5% positivity rate in the State.

Most central districts have also performed better in containing the spread of the virus during the week. The positive rate was 2.5% in Pudukottai district and 2.7% in Ariyalur district.

Thanjavur district that continued to witness a surge in cases of COVID-19 too seems to have brought the situation under control when compared to previous weeks. The positivity rate for the week stood at 3.7%, which is 1% less than the State average. Out of 18,770 samples lifted for testing, 691 tested positive for COVID-19.

Tiruchi Collector S. Sivarasu told The Hindu that the situation was under control in the district. There has been a steady decrease in the number of COVID 19 cases and positivity rate since August. Decentralisation of vegetable trading, intensive fever camps and high number of COVID testing were among the intensive measures taken to contain the spread of the virus in the district.

“We have never decreased the number of persons subjected for COVID-19 testing right from April. An average of 2,000 samples were lifted per day. Based on the results, we mounted vigil over the primary and secondary contacts of those who tested positive to check whether they were infected. The line departments worked in tandem to subject the primary and secondary contacts to rule out the infection,” Mr. Sivarasu said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/srcguz/article32924899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY23TESTINGTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/positivity-rate-comes-down-significantly-in-central-districts/article32919230.ece

439,2020/10/22,"Post-gauge conversion, Tiruvarur-Karaikudi track lies wasted","Non-deployment of regular gatekeepers a major factor

It is more than a year-and-a-half ago that the Tiruvarur-Karaikudi stretch was converted into broad gauge. Any wonder that the prolonged delay in resumption of regular train services on the 150-km section via Thiruthuraipoondi, Pattukottai, Peravurani and Aranthangi has caused huge disappointment to rail travellers especially those in the east coast of the delta region.

The demand for resumption of rail services has resurfaced yet again with the Pattukottai Taluk Railway Passengers’ Welfare Association reiterating its plea for early re-introduction of train services on the stretch that covers parts of Tiruvarur, Thanjavur, Pudukottai and Sivaganga districts.

Renewing the appeal, association president N. Jayaraman and secretary V. Viveganantham has sent a memorandum to the Minister of Railways requesting him to consider the long-pending demand that will benefit the people of the east coast of the delta. A copy of the memorandum has been sent to Tamil Maanila Congress president and Rajya Sabha member G.K. Vasan.

The demand has been brought to the notice of the railway administration at a time when train services are being resumed on select routes in the wake of relaxations announced during the pandemic.

The memorandum says the Tiruvarur-Pattukottai-Karaikudi is one of the oldest railway lines laid as a metre gauge during the colonial period. It was taken up for gauge conversion more than six years ago. Passenger train services on Tiruvarur-Karaikudi section were completely stopped during 2012 to enable conversion of the stretch to broad gauge.

The gauge conversion work took several years and was completed in portions: from Pattukottai to Karaikudi via Aranthangi (73.4 km) and then Tiruvarur to Pattukottai via Thiruthuraipoondi.

The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), Southern Circle, Bengaluru, who conducted mandatory inspection for three days from Pattukottai to Karaikudi following completion of gauge conversion works accorded statutory clearance and authorised the section for operation of passenger and freight trains in March 2018. A year later, the CRS inspected the remaining stretch from Tiruvarur to Pattukottai via Thiruthuraipoondi and accorded statutory clearance for operation of passenger and freight trains in April 2019.

Following repeated demands from travellers for resumption of rail services, the Tiruchi Railway Division initially operated Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU) specials with minimum coaches on Tiruvarur- Karaikudi-Tiruvarur stretch by deploying mobile gatekeepers on board due to non-deployment of regular gatekeepers at over 70 manned gates falling along the lengthy stretch.

However, the DEMU trains hardly found any patronage due to the lengthy duration of the journey. This was because the train stopped ahead of every manned gate and the mobile gatekeeper alighted from the train to close the gate for the train to pass through. The train would stop again for the mobile gatekeeper to board the coach. The exercise took a long time and the time taken by the DEMU trains to reach the destination was nearly six hours, which did not go down well with regular commuters.

Further the DEMU trains did not have toilets causing great inconvenience to travellers especially senior citizens. They were suspended and the stretch has not seen any passenger service since the lockdown was announced in March-end due to the pandemic.

“Introduction of rail services has been delayed in this section after completion of gauge conversion due to non-deployment of gatekeepers and other staff,” says Mr. Jayaraman in the memorandum.

“The east coast delta area is being neglected without any rail service to Chennai. Elders, women, traders, agriculturists and fishermen are the most affected due to lack of train facility to Chennai for the past 14 years,” the memorandum further points out.

“Despite the fact that crores of money have been spent by the railway administration for laying the new broad gauge track and creating new assets as part of gauge conversion, Tiruvarur-Karaikudi BG section has remained completely non-utilised due to non-deployment of gatekeepers leading to delay in resumption of train services,” adds Mr. Jayaraman.

He has urged authorities to address the issue at the earliest especially since festivals are round the corner.

Mr. Jayaraman and a few other office-bearers of the association has also raised the issue with Southern Railway General Manager John Thomas during his visit to Tiruchi raillay junction in December last.

The association has urged the Railway Minister to reintroduce an overnight daily express train between Chennai and Karaikudi via Tiruvarur, Pattukottai and operation of passenger trains between Mayiladuthurai and Karaikudi on the route.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ceag24/article32914447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY22TRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/post-gauge-conversion-tiruvarur-karaikudi-track-lies-wasted/article32914448.ece
440,2020/10/22,Data | Onion costs hit ₹100 as supply to markets dip,"Hike not likely to help farmers as much as other players in the supply chain

In Hyderabad, average retail prices of onion have surged to ₹100/kilo, with other cities close on the heels. Supply crunch, either naturally due to failed crops/flooded fields or artificially by hoarding of the vegetable, is the reason behind the drastic hike in prices.

With COVID-19 further straining an already fragile household food budget, many may omit onions from their diet. Notably, the price hike will not help farmers much, as other players in the supply chain corner a big chunk of profits from perishables.

Know your onions

The graph shows average retail price (₹/kilo) of onions in the first 21 days of October 2020 across ten cities. The deeper the shade of green, the cheaper the onion. The deeper the shade of red, the costlier. In most cities, cost of onions suddenly shot up in the last two days.

Missing bulbs

In Hyderabad, only 845 tonnes of onion arrived at the markets in the first fifteen days of October this year, a significant fall from similar periods in the last two years. Other major cities also recorded a significant shortfall in onion arrivals.

The table lists onion arrival (tonnes) in markets in the first 15 days of October.

Eating into the budget

An urban household in India spends ₹1,618 per month on an average on food and ₹178 on vegetables. As onions are selling at ₹72/kg on an average in urban areas in the second half of October, even purchasing a kilogram of them will consume 40% of a household's vegetable budget that month.

The table lists the % share of expenditure on onions of the total food and vegetable budget. For instance, an average urban household has to spend 18% of their monthly food budget to buy 4 kg of onions.

Farmers' share

Farmers’ average share in retail prices is lower in the case of perishables like onion and higher for non-perishables. Only 33% of onion’s retail price percolates back to the farmer, and the rest goes to other players in the supply chain.

441,2020/10/22,Decoding AlUla with Robert Polidori,"Robert Polidori’s photographs bring out the mystery and beauty of AlUla, in Assouline’s new coffee table book

The historical sites in AlUla, one of Saudi Arabia’s most important archaeological destinations — think the whispering canyons of Jabal Ikmah and the UNESCO World Heritage Site Hegra, with its well-preserved sandstone tombs — are reopening on October 31 (after being closed to visitors for over two years). But since not all of us are making travel plans yet, a great alternative to visiting this desert region is picking up New York publishers Assouline’s new coffee table book.

With stunning images taken by acclaimed Canadian-American photographer Robert Polidori, and interpretive illustrations by multidisciplinary Spanish artist Ignasi Monreal, it gives you a peek into the city’s rich history and unique culture. We speak with Polidori on the pandemic, his experiences working in AlUla and future projects. Edited excerpts:

As someone who’s recorded the restoration of Versailles, Chernobyl, and the aftermath of the flooding in New Orleans (after Hurricane Katrina), what has the pandemic meant to you as a photographer?

Like most other people I haven’t been able to travel. However, I’ve used this time to review my past by going over and putting some order in my archives. There have been times when I was close to depression. But I find that the most positive way to use the present period is to open one’s self to accept the conditions as they are while preparing for another day. The pandemic on the whole has not touched me as a photographer [except to prevent me from being one], but it has touched me deeply as a psychological human being.

What drew you to AlUla?

I was invited by Assouline. They had seen images I had taken of another Nabatean site, Petra Jordan, in 1998. At that time, I had heard of AlUla, and tried to gain access, but tourists were not allowed back then. When this request came, I felt it was a rare opportunity.

I discovered fantastic erosion patterns in the limestone rock formations; the entire region seems to have been sculpted by one of nature’s master artists. I wanted to capture a certain truth about the nature of the place. AlUla is a combination of masterfully-sculpted facades and interior spaces, cut into colorful limestone rock formations. It is indeed rare to walk inside interiors that are actually sculpted and not built, as is the case in the rest of the world. Also, I must add, the local date palm cultivation adds a great deal of amazing color contrast and impressive beauty.

Could you share a few anecdotes of your time there?

At the time of my visit, the outside ambient temperature was so hot that it melted the rubber gaskets of my camera’s lens coupling hardware. It’s amazing to see how the human body can stand a higher operating temperature than some machines.

Beauty is, of course, a subjective perception. AlUla is one of the most visually-striking desert regions I have ever seen. When you visit, I would recommend you to be openhearted and open minded to experience something you haven’t ever experienced before.

In the book, your photographs share space with illustrations by Ignasi Monreal.

The contrast shows the differences in the natures of reality and fantasy, shown side by side.

What projects are you planning to take up in the near future?

When normalcy returns, I would like to go back to Mumbai and continue photographing the evolving developments of the auto-constructed city areas such as Dharavi and Santa Cruz. I have been photographing there since 2007. The climate change phenomena, I guess, will put enormous stress on the collectivity of human habitat.

From approximately ₹66,000 onwards, AlUla is also available in the Ultimate — hand-bound, with colour plates hand-tipped on art-quality paper, and linen clamshell cases — and XXL formats.

442,2020/10/22,Hamilton eyes record 92nd victory,"Portugal returns to the calendar for the first time in 24 years

Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes seek to continue their record-making progress as Formula One escapes in search of some autumnal sunshine at this weekend’s Portuguese Grand Prix.

Two weeks after shivering at the Nurburgring where the six-time champion drew level with Michael Schumacher on 91 wins, the travelling circus hopes also to avoid any contact with the growing second wave of COVID-19 across Europe.

The local organisers of the race, which marks Portugal’s return to the calendar for the first time in 24 years, said there will be 27,500 spectators at the track each day under strictly-controlled conditions.

Major attraction

The lure of seeing Hamilton win a record 92nd race and Mercedes take an unprecedented seventh constructors’ championship is a major attraction, though the team’s triumph and celebrations are likely to be delayed by at least a week to the Emilia Romagna GP at Imola.

Hamilton has a simple goal to claim his record win, but Mercedes needs to outscore Red Bull by 40 points, a feat that would require a near perfect showing and a flop from Max Verstappen.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/formula-one/c0fmul/article32921376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23HAMI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/formula-one/hamilton-eyes-record-92nd-victory/article32921377.ece
443,2020/10/22,NK Racing to promote karting in India with CRG,"Selected drivers to receive extensive support and guidance from Narain

NK Racing Academy announced its partnership with Italian karting giant CRG, here on Wednesday.

The academy, that had groomed several young drivers between 2006 and 2010 and won multiple National single-seater championships, now aims to promote karting in India.

As part of the arrangement, NK Racing will become the official factory team of CRG, the world’s leading manufacturer of racing karts, for the Indian contingent. It was also the kart of choice of Formula One drivers like Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen.

Training programme

It has also launched a training programme for budding drivers in both the junior and senior class of karting with the aim of finding local talent at a young age and steering their careers forward.

Each driver will be chosen through a rigorous, multi-level selection process, which will take into account their skills, driving technique, mental ability and fitness level. The selected drivers will receive extensive support and guidance from Narain Karthikeyan.

He will personally assess the performance of the drivers and help them improve their craft. Also, the quickest among them will get an opportunity to graduate to CRG’s factory team in Italy.

“It’s a great opportunity for us to be in a partnership with CRG and help the drivers in karting with the best equipment and training. I feel, I can contribute a lot with the experience that I have gained over the years,” said Narain, its founder.

“CRG is pleased to enter into a partnership with Narain and his academy. He is the first F1 driver to emerge from India and it is our aim to successfully help generate the next big motorsport talent from there,” said Giancarlo Tinini, Founder and Chairman, CRG SpA.

To start with, NK Racing will participate in the National karting championship with two drivers — Divy Nandan (Delhi) and David Ryan (Chennai).",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/3ocikv/article32911998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22NARAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/nk-racing-to-promote-karting-in-india-with-crg/article32911999.ece
444,2020/10/22,U.K. scientific advisor says coronavirus unlikely to be eradicated,"“If vaccines are just around the corner then, in my view, we should try and keep the incidence as low as we can now,” John Edmunds, a member of Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told lawmakers.

The coronavirus will be around for “evermore” as it is unlikely it will be eradicated, a British scientist on the government's advisory committee for the pandemic said on Wednesday, although a vaccine would help improve the situation.

Britain, like other countries in Europe, is currently in the grip of a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, with much of the country under local restrictions and more than 21,000 daily cases reported on Tuesday.

“We are going to have to live with this virus for evermore. There is very little chance that it's going to become eradicated,” John Edmunds, a member of Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), told lawmakers.

Although the coronavirus will be around indefinitely, Edmunds said that the prospect of a vaccine towards the end of the winter should impact the government's strategy now.

“If vaccines are just around the corner then, in my view, we should try and keep the incidence as low as we can now, because we will be able to use vaccines in the not too distant future,” he said.

He said the U.K. had played a “clever game” in investing in different coronavirus vaccines. Britain has signed supply deals for six different COVID-19 vaccines, with 340 million doses secured across different types of technologies.

“I think we will be in a reasonable position in months,” he said. “I don't think we're going to be vaccinating everybody but to start, maybe the highest risk people, healthcare workers and so on.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/1nh2va/article32915890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKPHILIPPINES,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/uk-scientific-advisor-says-coronavirus-unlikely-to-be-eradicated/article32915891.ece
445,2020/10/22,New pair of salivary glands in humans discovered,"The team proposed the name “tubarial glands”

Researchers from the Netherlands Cancer Institute have discovered a new pair of salivary glands hidden between the nasal cavity and throat. They noticed the new gland while studying patients with prostate cancer using a new type of scan — a PSMA PET/CT scan

The scans of 100 patients and dissection studies on two cadavers were able to confirm the presence of this new gland.

The team proposed the name “tubarial glands” as it was found draped over the torus tubarius, the structure that supports the entrance of the auditory tube. The glands were about 3.9 centimeters in length on average.

“As far as we knew, the only salivary or mucous glands in the nasopharynx are microscopically small, and up to 1000 are evenly spread out throughout the mucosa. So, imagine our surprise when we found these,” Dr. Wouter V. Vogel from the Department of Nuclear Medicine at the Netherlands Cancer Institute said in a release.

The paper published by the team in Radiotherapy and Oncology noted that this identification “could help to explain and avoid radiation-induced side-effects” such as trouble during eating, swallowing, and speaking. The team analysed the data of 723 patients who had undergone radiation treatment and noted that there were more complications in patients who had more radiation delivered to these glands.

“For most patients, it should technically be possible to avoid delivering radiation to this newly discovered location of the salivary gland system in the same way we try to spare known glands,” Vogel concludes. “Our next step is to find out how we can best spare these new glands and in which patients. If we can do this, patients may experience less side effects which will benefit their overall quality of life after treatment.”

Should it be a new organ?

The paper adds that the classification of the tubarial glands was a matter of debate. It could be either a conglomerate of minor glands, a major gland, a separate organ, or a new part of an organ system.

As the glands have clinical relevance, they require a name that allows unique identification in daily clinical practice, writes the team.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/p77na6/article32915484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/download,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/new-pair-of-salivary-glands-in-humans-discovered/article32915485.ece
