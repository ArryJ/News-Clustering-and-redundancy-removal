Google has introduced an AI-powered feature in YouTube Stories, allowing users to enhance the quality of their selfie videos with altered voice and reduced background noise.

“While tremendous efforts are invested in improving the quality of videos taken with smartphone cameras, the quality of audio in videos is often overlooked,” Google noted in a blog post.

'Enhance speech' feature is based on machine learning (ML) technology, and uses both audio and visual signals to distinguish voices of people in a video from one another and other background noise.

The feature fuses 'enhanced speech' with just 10% background noise to improve video quality in iOS devices. YouTube Stories users can access the feature from volume controls editing tool.

After the video is recorded, the audio and the visual features are processed using the speech separation model to produce the enhanced speech.

1,2020/10/05,iOS 14 battery drain: Here’s how you can fix it,"Users with iPhone must note that the process involves a system reset.

Apple has offered potential fixes for users facing battery drain, missing data and other issues after updating their devices to iOS 14, launched mid-September.

Also Read Apple users complain of battery drain after iOS 14 update

Apple highlighted seven issues, including missing or inaccurate data in health apps, fitness or health apps not loading, and increased battery drain on iPhone or Apple Watch.

The Cupertino-based firm said users facing two or more of these issues should try the steps mentioned to fix them.

Users with iPhone must note that the process involves a system reset.

Apple asked users to unpair Apple watch from iPhone. To do so, open the Watch app, tap the My Watch Tab, then All Watches. Click on the info button next to the watch to unpair. Before erasing all content and settings, iPhone creates a new backup of Apple Watch, which can be used to restore it later.

Users should verify iCloud settings and create a backup. They must ensure that the device has enough cloud storage. To confirm that Health information is backed up, tap the profile picture option in the upper-right area in the Health app. At the bottom of the screen, they can verify when the data was last backed up. If the time shown isn’t recent, wait for the backup to finish and check again.

After finishing the backing up, erase all content and settings from the iPhone from the settings app by tapping on erase all content and settings. Now, restore iPhone and Apple Watch from iCloud backup. Once restored, open the Watch app on the iPhone and start pairing. Tap on restore from backup and choose the most recent backup to restore.

Apple said the steps will also help to prevent ‘future data loss’.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/1clsxw/article32774041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/apple-iOS-14jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ios-14-battery-drain-heres-how-you-can-fix-it/article32774004.ece
2,2020/10/05,IBM makes two of its space tech projects free to use,"“By open sourcing these two projects, we hope to give more people access to space tech and democratize access to space for all,” IBM said in a statement.

IBM on Thursday said it is making its satellite communications and path of space junk projects free to use.

“By open sourcing these two projects, we hope to give more people access to space tech and democratize access to space for all,” IBM said in a statement.

As more rockets are sent into space, debris from the launches, also called anthropogenic space objects (ASOs), are bound to increase.

IBM’s Space Situational Awareness(SSA) project helps in orbit determination and prediction of ASOs. The technology company aims to improve orbit prediction using Machine Learning (ML) to learn when physical models incorrectly predict an ASO’s future location.

Building a ML model to predict all of orbital dynamics is a hefty task as a lot of data is required to learn orbital mechanics.

The other project, KubeSat, is designed for swarms of cube satellites that enable multi-satellite communications. Open sourcing KubeSat means satellite swarm industry and other smaller operators can use IBM’s space tech.

“With the proliferation of satellites of all sizes in lower earth orbit in space, enormous amounts of data will be produced related to earth observation, to space traffic management, to space situational awareness,” IBM said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/vah1kd/article32773939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ibm-spacejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ibm-makes-two-of-its-space-tech-projects-free-to-use/article32773889.ece

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Telegram Messenger added search filters and anonymous group admin to its recent update, the company said in a statement.

The search filters feature allows users to filter results by media, links, and files. Users can also filter based on time period by typing in the desired date. Source-based search can be done by adding the name of the person, group, channel or bot.

The search filters can also be combined for specific searches like 'messages with a link, sent in March 2016, containing the word ""boat"".’

Users can now choose to remain anonymous group admins by clicking on Remain Anonymous in Admin rights to enable Batman mode. The anonymised admin will be hidden in the list of group members, and their messages in the chat will be signed with the group name, similar to channel posts.

This development comes as Telegram is being used increasingly in organising protests for democracy and freedom, the statement said.

The Dubai-based messenger app also rolled out the comment button on channels with discussion groups, which allows users to comment to individual posts.

5,2020/10/05,"Social media abuse drives girls off Facebook, Instagram, Twitter: poll","One in five girls and young women has abandoned or cut down on using a social media platform after being targeted, with some saying harassment started when they were as young as eight, the survey by girls' rights group Plan International showed.

Online abuse is driving girls to quit social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, with nearly 60% experiencing harassment, a global study showed on Sunday.

One in five girls and young women has abandoned or cut down on using a social media platform after being targeted, with some saying harassment started when they were as young as eight, the survey by girls' rights group Plan International showed.

“Girls are being silenced by a toxic level of harassment,” said the organisation's chief executive, Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen.

Attacks were most common on Facebook, where 39% of girls polled said they had been harassed, followed by Instagram (23%), WhatsApp (14%), Snapchat (10%), Twitter (9%) and TikTok (6%).

The charity, which will share the report with social media companies and lawmakers around the world, said the abuse was suppressing girls' voices at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic was increasing the importance of communicating online.

It called on social media companies to take urgent action to address the issue and urged governments to pass laws to deal with online harassment.

The study found reporting tools were ineffective in stopping the abuse, which included explicit messages, pornographic photos and cyberstalking.

Nearly half of girls targeted had been threatened with physical or sexual violence, according to the poll. Many said the abuse took a mental toll, and a quarter felt physically unsafe.

“It is time for this to stop. Girls should not have to put up with behaviour online which would be criminal on the streets,” the report said.

Facebook and Instagram said they used artificial intelligence to look for bullying content, constantly monitored users' reports of abuse and always removed rape threats.

Twitter said it also used technology to catch abusive content and has launched tools to improve users' control over their conversations.

The survey polled 14,000 girls and young women aged 15 to 25 in 22 countries including Brazil, India, Nigeria, Spain, Thailand and the United States.

Albrectsen said activists, including those campaigning for gender equality and on LGBT+ issues, were often targeted particularly viciously, and their lives and families threatened.

“Driving girls out of online spaces is hugely disempowering in an increasingly digital world, and damages their ability to be seen, heard and become leaders,” she added.

In an open letter to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter, girls from around the world called on social media companies to create more effective ways to report abuse.

“We use (your platforms) not just to connect with friends, but to lead and create change. But they are not safe for us. We get harassed and abused on them. Every. Single. Day,” they wrote.

“As this global pandemic moves our lives online, we are more at risk than ever.”

Plan International also urged the companies to do more to hold to account those behind such abuse, and to collect data on the scale of the problem.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/2l340o/article32770388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/online-abuse-girlsJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/social-media-abuse-drives-girls-off-facebook-instagram-twitter-poll/article32770349.ece
6,2020/10/05,Mali frees over 100 jihadists,"It seeks the release of politician, charity worker in return

Insurgency-hit Mali has freed over 100 alleged or convicted jihadists to secure the release of a top politician and a French charity worker, sources close to the talks said Monday.

This is a rare mass release of prisoners in the fragile West African country, which is struggling with an eight-year-old Islamist insurgency.

Soumaila Cisse, a former opposition leader and three-time presidential candidate, was abducted on March 25 while campaigning in his home region of Niafounke ahead of legislative elections.

Sophie Petronin, a French charity worker, was abducted by gunmen on December 24, 2016, in the northern city of Gao. She is presently the last French national held hostage in the world.

“As part of the negotiations to obtain the release of Soumaila Cisse and Sophie Petronin, more than one hundred jihadist prisoners were released this weekend,” a person in charge of the negotiations said.

An official at the security services confirmed the information.

7,2020/10/05,Jewish student attacked outside German synagogue,"Crime is being probed as an attempted murder with anti-Semitic intent; Merkel calls act a disgrace

German investigators said on Monday that they were probing an attack on a Jewish student outside a synagogue in Hamburg as attempted murder with anti-Semitic intent, a case condemned by Chancellor Angela Merkel as a “disgrace”.

The 26-year-old student was badly injured on Sunday by a man who repeatedly struck him on the head with a shovel outside the synagogue where the Jewish community was celebrating Sukkot, also known as the Feast of the Tabernacles.

The assault came a year after two people were shot dead by an extremist who tried and failed to storm a synagogue in the eastern German city of Halle.

Jewish leaders and top politicians led condemnation of the latest attack, which Ms. Merkel’s spokesman described as a “repulsive” assault.

“Such an attack is repulsive, no matter what investigations about the motivation and the condition of the perpetrator might show,” said spokesman Steffen Seibert.

Suspect arrested

“And it must be clearly stated by everyone in this society: in Germany, every such act is a disgrace.”

The suspect, 29, was arrested by police officers who were assigned to protect the synagogue in the northern city.

Dressed in combat fatigues, he had a piece of paper with a hand-drawn swastika in his pocket, said police and prosecutors in a statement.

“The current assessment of the situation suggests that this is an anti-Semitic motivated attack,” they said, adding that investigators are treating the case as “attempted murder with grievous bodily harm”.

Ronald Lauder, leader of the World Jewish Congress, demanded action, saying that the attacker “must be held responsible as must all who engage in any expressions of hate or intolerance”.

8,2020/10/05,‘U.S.-made F-16 jets are being used against Armenians’,"Armenian leader asks Trump’s NSA Robert O’Brien if the planes were given to bomb peaceful villages

When Nikol Pashinyan, Armenia’s Prime Minister, spoke by telephone on Thursday with President Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien, he raised a delicate issue: Why is nothing being done to stop a longtime U.S. ally, Turkey, from using U.S.-made F-16 jets against ethnic Armenians in a disputed mountain region?

Mr. Pashinyan’s call to Mr. Robert O’Brien followed an eruption of heavy fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a remote territory at the centre of the most enduring and venomous of the “frozen conflicts” left by the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The breakaway enclave, legally part of Azerbaijan but controlled by Armenians for the past three decades, has seen many military flare-ups over the years. But the current fighting, Mr. Pashinyan said in a telephone interview, has taken on a far more dangerous dimension because of Turkey’s direct military intervention in support of Azerbaijan, its ethnic Turkic ally.

On Sunday, news reports said, the forces of Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, exchanged rocket fire, with missiles falling on Azerbaijan’s second largest city, Ganja, and on the Armenian-controlled capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. Each side accused the other of targeting .

In a statement on Sunday, the International Committee of the Red Cross denounced “a surge in attacks using heavy explosive weaponry on populated areas,” which it said “is taking a deadly toll on civilians.”

The conflict has set off alarms about the risks of a wider war and put the U.S., with its large and politically influential Armenian diaspora, in the uncomfortable position of watching Turkey, a vital NATO ally, deploying F-16 jets in support of Armenia’s enemies.

‘Heard, acknowledged’

“The U.S.,” Mr. Pashinyan said, “needs to explain whether it gave those F-16s to bomb peaceful villages and peaceful populations.” He said that Mr. O’Brien had “heard and acknowledged” his concerns and promised to set up a phone conversation between the Armenian leader and Mr. Trump.

That opportunity to rally the U.S. to Armenia’s side vanished just a few hours later when Mr. Trump announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus.

But Mr. Trump’s health issues, analysts say, have only accentuated his administration’s disengagement from a conflict that offers no easy diplomatic victories. It has confounded decades of efforts to resolve a dispute that has left Armenians in control of not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also large swaths of Azerbaijani territory outside the breakaway enclave.

Mr. Pashinyan declined to say whether Armenia might be ready to surrender any occupied Azerbaijani land as part of a possible peace settlement, insisting that this was not up to him but a matter for the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh, a nominally independent entity ruled by ethnic Armenians.

9,2020/10/05,Pakistan charges former President Zardari,"He is facing two corruption cases

A Pakistani court on Monday officially charged the country’s former President Asif Ali Zardari in two corruption cases, escalating the legal challenges facing the now leading opposition lawmaker and widower of assassinated former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

The development came as Mr. Zardari’s party and a key anti-government ally were preparing for a massive rally against Prime Minister Imran Khan later this month. Mr. Zardari was released on bail on medical grounds last December, six months after his arrest.

During Monday’s court appearance in the capital, Islamabad, Mr. Zardari pleaded not guilty to money laundering and corruption charges. He later told reporters he was not surprised by the indictment and that charges are something he routinely faces whenever he is in the opposition.

10,2020/10/05,Sri Lanka sees a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases,"Country recorded at least 101 new infections on Monday

Months after successfully containing the spread of the coronavirus, Sri Lanka on Monday reported a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases — whose source remains unclear — raising questions over possible community transmission that authorities have so far denied.

On Monday evening, Sri Lanka’s Health Promotion Bureau had recorded at least 101 new cases, in the last 24 hours, raising the total number of COVID-19 cases to about 3,500. Sri Lanka has so far reported 13 deaths since the outbreak in March.

Factory outbreak

Health officials conducted about 2,000 PCR tests after a woman employed in a garment factory in Minuwangoda, about 40 km north of Colombo, tested positive this weekend. Subsequent tests among workers revealed 69 of them were infected and prompted authorities to impose a police curfew in the district. Army Commander Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva, who heads the National Centre for the Prevention of COVID-19, told local news portal Colombo Gazette that “contingency plans were in place”. The government has also urged the public to refrain from non-essential travel and large gatherings.

The recently tested COVID-19 cases come at a time when Sri Lanka is mulling re-opening the country to tourists to help revive its pandemic-hit economy. With its vital export sector and foreign remittances badly affected, Sri Lanka is due to repay some $3 billion of its external debt this year. On Friday, the government settled a $1 billion-worth International Sovereign Bond, amid persisting fiscal strain.

The island nation was among the few countries in the world that contained the spread of infection with early interventions, by public health officials and the Army, including a stringent curfew and aggressive contact tracing.

International leaders and agencies, including the World Health Organization, have commended Sri Lanka’s effective response to the pandemic.

Further, the government has also restricted the return of several thousand Sri Lankan migrant workers, stuck in West Asian countries where they are employed, fearing they might bring home the virus. Though Sri Lanka boasts of a relatively low COVID-19 death rate, 64 Sri Lankan migrant workers have died from contracting COVID-19 so far in their host countries, according to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k4tej5/article32776152.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-SRILANKA-HEALTH-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-sees-a-sudden-spike-in-covid-19-cases/article32776153.ece
11,2020/10/05,"Armenia, Azerbaijan clashes resume over separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh","Firefights of varying intensity continue to rage in the conflict zone, Armenian Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanian said on Facebook.

The fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh resumed on Monday morning, with both sides accusing each other of launching attacks.

Armenian military officials on Monday reported missile strikes hitting Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. The region lies in Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994.

The Hindu Explains | What’s behind the Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes?

Firefights of varying intensity continue to rage in the conflict zone, Armenian Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanian said on Facebook.

The Azerbaijani Defence Ministry, in turn, accused Armenian forces of shelling the towns of Tartar, Barda and Beylagan. Ganja, Azerbaijan’s second-largest city far outside of the conflict zone, is also under fire, officials said.

Armenia’s Foreign Ministry in a statement dismissed allegations of the attacks being launched from the Armenia’s territory as a disinformation campaign waged by Azerbaijan.

Vahram Poghosyan, spokesman for Nagorno-Karabakh’s leader, on Monday warned in a Facebook post that the territory’s forces would target military facilities in Azerbaijani cities in response to strikes on Stepanakert and Shushi, a town in Nagorno-Karabakh.

The fighting erupted on September 27 and has killed dozens, marking the biggest escalation in the decades-old conflict over the region. Both sides have accused each other of expanding the hostilities beyond the conflict zone in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Nagorno-Karabakh officials have said nearly 200 servicemen on their side have died in the clashes so far. Eighteen civilians have been killed and more than 90 others wounded. Azerbaijani authorities haven’t given details about their military casualties, but said 24 civilians were killed and 121 others were wounded.

Nagorno-Karabakh was a designated autonomous region within Azerbaijan during the Soviet era. It claimed independence from Azerbaijan in 1991, about three months before the Soviet Union’s collapse. A full-scale war that broke out in 1992 killed an estimated 30,000 people.

By the time the war ended in 1994, Armenian forces not only held Nagorno-Karabakh itself but substantial areas outside the territory’s formal borders.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has repeatedly said that Armenia’s withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh is the sole condition to end the fighting.

Armenian officials allege that Turkey is involved in the conflict on the side of Azerbaijan and is sending fighters from Syria to the region. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said that a cease-fire can be established only if Turkey is removed from the South Caucasus.

12,2020/10/05,Scientists tell Spanish politicians to shed politics and rely on science for response,"Science community drafts a 10-point manifesto after a political turf war between the left-wing national government and the conservative authorities before Madrid lockdown.

Scientific groups representing over 1,70,000 health workers are urging Spanish politicians to base their response to the coronavirus pandemic on science rather than politics.

The 10-point manifesto by 55 scientific societies comes after a political turf war between the left-wing national government and the conservative authorities of the Madrid region led to weeks of back and forth before the Spanish capital was partially locked down late on Friday.

With 647 new coronavirus infections per 1,00,000 residents in the past two weeks, Madrid has been the source of Europe’s most worrying surge of infections in the ongoing second wave of the pandemic.

The manifesto, published Sunday in all the major newspapers, was headlined “In health, you rule but you don’t know.

The scientists wrote that decisions must be based on the best available scientific evidence, completely detached from the continuous political confrontation.

The manifesto also calls for less red tape in adopting measures against virus outbreaks, for authorities in Spain’s 19 regions to abide by a set of national scientific standards that would dictate the response and an end to interference in medical decisions.

Addressing politicians in general, the scientists write: On behalf of more than 47 million Spaniards, including you and your families, we have to change so much political, professional and human inconsistency.

13,2020/10/05,Former Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari indicted in Park Lane and Thatta Water cases,"He was indicted in a mega money laundering case last week.

An anti-corruption court in Pakistan on Monday indicted former president Asif Ali Zardari in the Park Lane and Thatta Water Supply cases.

Mr. Zardari, 63, the co-chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), was present in the Islamabad-based court and pleaded not guilty.

During the hearing, the court indicted 19 others accused in the Park Lane case and 15 others in the Thatta water supply case.

The court last week had indicted Mr. Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur in a mega money laundering case.

In the Park Lane case, Mr. Zardari and his son Bilawal Ali Zardari are accused of purchasing 2,460 kanals of prime property in Islamabad at extremely depreciated rates using frontmen.

In the Thatta water supply case, a private contractor was illegaly awarded project contracts. In the money laundering case, it is alleged fake accounts were used by the former President and other accused to park and launder ill-gotten wealth.

The court has rejected Zardari’s plea seeking acquittal in all three cases.

The husband of the country’s first woman prime minister Benazir Bhutto was arrested last year by the National Accountability Bureau and probed for months before being released in December on medical grounds.

14,2020/10/05,FATF all set to decide on Pakistan’s grey list status,"The meeting was earlier scheduled in June but Islamabad got an unexpected breather following the Covid-19 outbreak.

The Financial Action Task Force is all set to decide on Pakistan’s grey list status in a virtual meeting scheduled later this month, according to a media report on Monday.

The Paris-based global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Seeking to wriggle out of the FATF’s grey list, debt-ridden Pakistan in August imposed financial sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders, including 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.

The virtual FATF plenary scheduled for October 21-23 will decide if Pakistan should be excluded from its grey list, based on a review of Islamabad’s performance to meet global commitments and standards on fight against Money Laundering and Terror Financing (ML&TF), the Dawn News reported.

The meeting was earlier scheduled in June but Islamabad got an unexpected breather after the global watchdog against financial crimes temporarily postponed all mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines in the wake of grave health risk following Covid-19 pandemic, it said.

The agency also put a general pause in the review process, thus giving additional four months to Pakistan to meet the requirements.

In February, the FATF gave Pakistan, which missed 13 targets, a four-month grace period to complete its 27-point action plan against ML&TF committed with the international community.

In its third plenary held virtually in June, the FATF decided to keep Pakistan in the grey list as Islamabad failed to check flow of money to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).

With Pakistan’s continuation in the ‘grey list’, it is increasingly becoming difficult for the country to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the nation which is in a precarious financial situation.

In July, Pakistan’s Senate unanimously approved two bills related to the tough conditions set by FATF. In August, Parliament’s lower house passed four FATF-related bills as part of the efforts by Pakistan to move from the FATF’s grey list to the white list.

In September, the joint session of the Parliament amended about 15 laws to upgrade its legal system matching international standards as required by the FATF. The government has already submitted its report to the FATF and its affiliated review groups and responded to their comments, detailing compliance with the 13 outstanding action points, the Dawn report stated.

The FATF meeting this month will review Pakistan’s compliance with the 13 remaining action points. The FATF will examine if the country had demonstrated remedial actions and sanctions applied in cases of violations relating to terrorist financing risk management and terror financing sanctions obligations.

The FATF will also judge if competent authorities were cooperating and taking action to identify and taking enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services and had proven implementation of cross-border currency and bearer negotiable instruments controls at all ports of entry, including applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.

Pakistan has also to determine if law enforcement agencies were identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity and that terrorist financing (TF) probes and prosecution target designated persons and entities, and those acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities besides showing TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, the report said.

The country’s outstanding action areas also include effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all 1,267 and 1,373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets (movable and immovable), and prohibiting access to funds and financial services, it said.

If the FATF in its meeting finds that Pakistan has failed to meet its requirements, there is every possibility that the global body may put the country in the ‘Black List’ along with North Korea and Iran.

In August, Prime Minister Imran Khan had warned that if blacklisted at the FATF, Pakistan’s entire economy will be destroyed due to inflation and a massive fall in Pakistani Rupee.

The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.

The FATF currently has 39 members including two regional organisations - the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sha6db/article32607564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FATF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fatf-all-set-to-decide-on-pakistans-grey-list-status/article32770893.ece
15,2020/10/05,London transport regulator strips Ola's operating licence over public safety failings,"Bengaluru-based Ola entered the London taxi market in February this year

London's public transport authority stripped Indian ride-hailing company Ola of its London operating licence, saying that the taxi app was not “fit and proper” to hold one, having put passenger safety at risk.

Bengaluru-based Ola entered the London taxi market in February this year. The market is dominated by rivals including Uber, Freenow and Bolt, and traditional black cab drivers who previously blocked streets in protest at what they see as a threat to their livelihoods.

Transport for London (TfL) said in a statement that it refused to grant Ola, a Softbank-backed operator, a new London private hire vehicle (PHV) operator's licence as it ”cannot find it fit and proper to hold one after discovering a number of failures that could have risked public safety”.

TfL's decision came days after Uber won a legal bid to restore its London operating licence, which was taken away over safety concerns, after a judge ruled that the company was a fit and proper operator despite “historical failings”.

TfL said it had discovered a number of failures in Ola's operations, including breaches of its licensing regime, which led to unlicensed drivers and vehicles undertaking more than 1,000 passenger trips on the platform's behalf.

Ola was also accused of failing to notify Tfl of the breaches when they were first identified.

“Ola can continue to operate pending the outcome of any appeal process”, TfL said, adding that Ola had 21 days to appeal against TfL's decision.

In an emailed statement, Ola said it was working with TfL during the review period and “have sought to provide assurances and address the issues raised in an open and transparent manner”.

“Ola will take the opportunity to appeal this decision”, the company said, adding it would continue to operate as normal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/jf8kzo/article31958527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/london-transport-regulator-strips-olas-operating-licence-over-public-safety-failings/article32770794.ece
16,2020/10/05,Egypt unveils 59 ancient coffins in major archaeological discovery,"The mission will continue opening the coffins and studying their contents before their eventual display at the Grand Egyptian Museum

Egypt on Saturday put on show dozens of coffins belonging to priests and clerks from the 26th dynasty nearly 2,500 years ago, with archaeologists saying tens more were found in the vast Saqqara necropolis just days ago.

The 59 coffins were discovered in August at the UNESCO world heritage site south of Cairo, buried in three 10-12 meter shafts along with 28 statues of the ancient Egyptian God Seker, one of the most important funerary deities.

The Egyptian archaeological mission behind the discovery had been active since 2018 and previously unveiled a cache of mummified animals and a well-preserved tomb of a fifth dynasty royal priest called 'Wahtye' in the area.

Mostafa al-Waziri, secretary-general of Egypts Supreme Council of Antiquities explained the team had uncovered the three shafts where the coffins were laid in “perfect condition” due to a protective seal that preserved them from chemical reactions.

17,2020/10/05,U.S. health officials contact 206 people at Trump event at Bedminster,"Officials ask guests and employees to monitor their symptoms and, if they were close to President Trump or his staff, to quarantine for 14 days.

State health officials in New Jersey have contacted more than 200 people who attended a campaign fundraiser at the Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster on Thursday, hours before the United States President announced he had COVID-19, as they try to contain the spread of the deadly virus.

Somerset County officials were meanwhile contacting employees who worked the event, most of whom live in the county.

In a joint statement issued on Sunday, the officials asked guests and employees to monitor their symptoms and, if they were close to President Trump or his staff, to quarantine for 14 days.

The officials, who started seeking the information on Friday, said on Sunday that the White House had sent them a list of 206 guests. They declined to say when they had received the names. They were advising guests not to be tested for five to seven days out from the event.

While the risk is low, a negative test earlier than that time cannot definitively rule out that COVID-19 will not develop, the statement said.

No contact, says White House

White House spokesperson Judd Deere said the President had no contact with any donors or staff that would be considered to be ‘close’ based on CDC guidelines (more than 15 minutes and within 6 feet).

During the roundtable event and remarks, the President was more than 6 feet away from all participants, he said.

Dallas businessman Daniel Hux, who attended the event, said he was feeling fine on Sunday, and had just undergone another test, as he and other donors had before the fundraiser.

“I’m grateful our President engaged his supporters safely while at the event,” Mr. Hux said in a statement. “My prayers are with our President and the first lady.”

Mr. Hux, who owns a mortgage company, declined to say where he had travelled in the interim. He said he was never within 6 feet of the President, but was quarantining just in case.

Dr. Rich Roberts, a pharmaceutical executive from New Jersey who made a video describing the event, said he sat a seat away from Mr. Trump during an indoor roundtable event, which he said involved about 19 people and lasted perhaps 45 minutes or more.

Dr. Roberts did not return messages on Sunday from The Associated Press about the video, which was posted on a local news site, The Lakewood (New Jersey) Scoop.

Charlie Kolean, also from Dallas, said the coronavirus test he took upon returning home from New Jersey came back negative on Sunday. He’ll take another one in a few days.

Mr. Kolean, who works in investments, said from what he noticed at the event, Trump campaign members were all masked and socially distant, as were Bedminster staff, who also wore gloves.

During the photo opportunity with the President, the 25-year-old said donors were required to stand 6 feet from the president, on a marker taped to the floor.

“I know there were rumors of him being lethargic or tired. That was not the case at all at this event. He was very high energy, happy to be there. I noticed no difference in his health from previous times I’ve seen him,” Mr. Kolean said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2p2fp6/article32769918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKVIRUSOUTBREAKTRUMPTIMELINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-health-officials-contact-206-people-at-trump-event-at-bedminster/article32769919.ece

Ms Pelosi said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation”: “We need to have trust that what they’re telling us about the President’s condition is real.”

Her interview aired before the President’s medical team held a news conference at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he is receiving treatment.

Pressed about the conflicting information he and the White House released the day before, Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley acknowledged Sunday that he had tried to present a rosy description of the President’s condition.

The doctor also said Mr Trump’s blood oxygen level dropped suddenly twice in recent days, but he “has continued to improve” since then.

Ms Pelosi says she’s worried that the information the doctors are relaying to the public “has to be approved by the President.

19,2020/10/05,Dubai to unveil world’s largest fountain on October 22,"The fountain will be located at the Pointe, a lifestyle and dining destination, and will be spread over 14,000 sq ft of sea water while its super shooter will be 105-metre tall and have over 3,000 LED lights

In a bid to make a Guinness World Record, Dubai is all set to unveil the world’s largest fountain on October 22.

The fountain will be located at the Pointe, a lifestyle and dining destination, and will be spread over 14,000 sq ft of sea water while its super shooter will be 105-metre tall and have over 3,000 LED lights.

Omar Khoory, managing director, Nakheel Malls, said, “We look forward to the inspiration this will bring customers at The Pointe, residents of Palm Jumeirah, our retailers, tourists and the wider community.”

Ahmed Al Khaja, CEO of Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE), said the Palm Fountain is yet another incredible addition to Dubai’s list of world-famous landmarks and is sure to be a big draw among residents and visitors alike.

The Palm Fountain will have 20 bespoke shows with five different shows running daily between sunset and midnight (7 p.m. to 12 a.m.) while swaying to an array of popular songs including Khaleeji, pop, classic, international and more.

Each show will last three minutes and will be performed every 30 minutes.

Xin Su, chairman, Beijing Water Design Technology, said, “We are proud to be part of the design, build and operation of The Palm Fountain — an extraordinary feat. As one of China’s largest fountain specialists, this project was unique for us as we had the opportunity to tackle many firsts in ingenuity.”

Shaddy Gaad, senior marketing manager--MENA, Guinness World Records (GWR) said the fountain will be a great addition to Dubai’s long list of attractions.

The GWR is in the process of verifying the largest fountain and we look forward to hopefully seeing this world-class landmark being declared officially amazing, Gaad said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4rqf0x/article32768789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PALMKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dubai-to-unveil-worlds-largest-fountain-on-october-22/article32768790.ece
20,2020/10/05,"US, Russia to hold latest nuclear arms talks in Finland","The talks are aimed at producing a new agreement to replace the New START treaty that expires in February — the last remaining pact constraining the arsenals of the world’s two major nuclear powers.

The United States and Russia will hold a round of nuclear arms control talks in the Finland’s capital, Helsinki, on Monday to follow up on negotiations in Austria this summer, the Finnish president’s office said.

“The round of discussions on strategic stability and nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia, which began in Vienna in the summer, will continue in Helsinki on Monday,” the office of the Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said in a brief statement late Sunday.

The office said nuclear arms negotiators from Washington and Moscow met a previous time in Finland in 2017.

“Finland welcomes the negotiators, this time (US) Ambassador (Marshall) Billingslea and (Russian) Deputy Foreign Minister (Sergei) Ryabkov,” the statement said, adding that Niinisto would meet both representatives after the talks.

The talks are aimed at producing a new agreement to replace the New START treaty that expires in February — the last remaining pact constraining the arsenals of the world’s two major nuclear powers.

According to Russian news agency TASS, the previous round of consultations between Billingslea and Ryabkov were held in Vienna on August 17-18.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bwjs68/article32769173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FINAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-russia-to-hold-latest-nuclear-arms-talks-in-finland/article32769174.ece
21,2020/10/05,"Coronavirus | Ignoring concerns, Donald Trump takes a car ride","The President’s visit came shortly after he promised his supporters a surprise in a video posted a video on social media.

Infected and contagious, President Donald Trump briefly ventured out in a motorcade on Sunday to salute cheering supporters, a move that disregarded precautions meant to contain the deadly virus that has forced his hospitalisation and killed more than 2,09,000 Americans.

With one month until election day, Mr. Trump was eager to project strength despite his illness. The President surprised supporters who had gathered outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, driving by in a black SUV with the windows rolled up. Secret Service agents inside the vehicle could be seen in masks and other protective gear.

The move capped a weekend of contradictions that fuelled confusion about Mr. Trump’s health, which has imperilled the leadership of the U.S. government and upended the final stages of the presidential campaign. While Mr. Trump’s physician offered a rosy prognosis on his condition, his briefings lacked basic information, including the findings of lung scans, or were quickly muddled by more serious assessments of the President’s health by other officials.

‘This is insanity’

In a short video released by the White House on Sunday, Mr. Trump insisted he understood the gravity of the moment. But his actions moments later, by leaving the hospital and sitting inside the SUV with others, suggested otherwise.

“This is insanity,” Dr. James P. Phillips, an attending physician at Walter Reed who is a critic of Mr. Trump and his handling of the pandemic. “Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary presidential ‘drive-by’ just now has to be quarantined for 14 days. They might get sick. They may die.”

“For political theater,” the doctor added. “Commanded by Trump to put their lives at risk for theater.”

White House spokesman Judd Deere said Mr. Trump’s trip outside the hospital “was cleared by the medical team as safe to do.” He added that precautions were taken, including using personal protective equipment, to protect Mr. Trump as well as White House officials and Secret Service agents.

Joe Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, said the Democratic presidential nominee again tested negative for COVID-19 on Sunday. The results come five days after Mr. Biden spent more than 90 minutes on the debate stage with Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden, who has taken a far more cautious approach to in-person events, had two negative tests on Friday.

For his part, Mr. Trump still faces questions about his health.

It was the second straight day of obfuscation from a White House already suffering from a credibility crisis. And it raised more doubts about whether the doctors treating the president were sharing accurate, timely information with the American public about the severity of his condition.

Conflicting messages

Pressed about conflicting information, Dr. Sean Conley said that he had tried to present a sunnier description of the President’s condition.

“I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the President, that his course of illness has had. Didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction,” Dr. Conley said. “And in doing so, you know, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true. The fact of the matter is that he’s doing really well.”

Medical experts said Dr. Conley’s revelations were hard to square with his positive assessment and talk of a discharge.

“There’s a little bit of a disconnect,” said Dr. Steven Shapiro, chief medical and scientific officer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

According to CDC guidelines, “In general, transport and movement of a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes.”

Even before Mr. Trump’s motorcade outing on Sunday, some Secret Service agents have expressed concern about the lackadaisical attitude toward masks and social distancing inside the White House, but there isn’t much they can do, according to agents and officials who spoke to.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jfk9sv/article32768924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-trump-leaves-hospital-briefly-to-greet-supporters-outside/article32768925.ece
22,2020/10/05,Here is why you should read more into Facebook’s rejection of documentary The Social Dilemma,"In a seven-part report, Facebook calls the Netflix film by Jeff Orlowski a “conspiracy documentary” which “buries the substance in sensationalism.” We dissect the report for you:

Watched The Social Dilemma? Perhaps it has shaken up your household’s perspective of how your offline lives are mediated by the ones you lead online.

The Jeff Orlowski-directed documentary, which struck a chord with many netizens upon its global release in September, has already been bookmarked as a favourite among anti-trust regulators who are more than eager to see the downfall of the world’s largest social media entities.

The film, serving as a ‘burn book’ of all the big Internet companies, features first-person accounts from several ‘whistleblowers’ who have worked at Facebook, Twitter, Google and more. All of them left these organisations based on ethical concerns. In terms of Facebook, much of the information came directly from Justin Rosenstein, the former co-creator of the Facebook ‘like’ button.

Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg; Justin Rosenstein co-creator Facebook ‘like’ button

As October 2020 kicked off, Facebook has now published a rebuttal to The Social Dilemma; it addresses the platform’s notoriety for bypassing users’ privacy, the rapid spread of misinformation, fake news and hate speech, the advancement of political polarisation, and threats against the inherent values of elections.

The report ‘What The Social Dilemma Gets Wrong’ by Facebook, a seven-part breakdown of the corroborated arguments made in the film, was posted on its official website and attributed to no particular spokesperson. “The film’s creators do not include insights from those currently working at the companies or any experts that take a different view of the narrative put forward by the film. They don’t acknowledge — critically or otherwise — the efforts already taken by companies to address many of the issues they raise. Instead, they rely on commentary from those who haven’t been on the inside for many years,” it states, adding the film is “distorted” in its approach.

Mental health and fear

Facebook claims its News Feed, is “not incentivised to build features that increase time-spent on our products. Instead, we want to make sure we offer value to people, not just drive usage.”

The platform refers to a 2018 change to News Feed wherein they adjusted the ranking in users’ timelines “to prioritise meaningful social interactions and deprioritise things like viral videos. The change led to a decrease of 50 [million] hours a day worth of time spent on Facebook.” The company points out they have been actively working with mental health organisations to further understand the effects social media has on users. For example, in April 2020, Facebook released Quiet Time, a digital well-being feature that helps users spend certain time slots on the platform — but few know of this feature.

Probably one of the more mind-boggling arguments Facebook, to its credit, acknowledges is its leveraging of algorithmic power just as Netflix does, “to determine who it thinks should watch The Social Dilemma film.”

Facebook seemingly waves off the concern around algorithms. Yes, algorithms are the norm but be aware of the concept’s evolution. While algorithms started out as a way for technology to help rank searches according to the user’s shared data, they have been developed to become one of Internet companies’ favourite surveillance tactics. In this case, Facebook states, “portraying algorithms as ‘mad’ may make good fodder for conspiracy documentaries, but the reality is a lot less entertaining.” However, many who have watched The Social Dilemma would not necessarily categorise it as ‘entertainment’ but more as a reality check.

We cannot speak of algorithms without speaking of advertising. Facebook claims they are “funded by advertising so that it remains free for people... We don’t sell your information to anyone.” The platform insists that they “provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people who are seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but [they] don’t share information that personally identifies you unless you give [them] permission.”

Facebook-owned Instagram, which turns 10 on October 6, 2020, has one of the most contentious News Feeds across social networking platforms; its evolution has gone from simply featuring posts in a chronological order in publishing of those in a user’s circle to interspersing algorithm-driven sponsored and recommended posts across the basic News Feed and Explore pages. Sadly, Instagram still tells you what you need to see.

The Social Dilemma makes strong references to the Cambridge Analytica data breach of 2018, which led to Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg sitting through a gruelling Senate hearing that same year. Zuckerberg was asked whether or not Facebook would still have access to a user’s information should they delete their information and account from the platform. Zuckerberg responded Facebook will not be able to access any information or content a user shared in the past. However, some third-party apps may still have access to some of this data. Interestingly, even when users delete their accounts, it can take up to 90 days for Facebook to remove content such photos and updates stored in backup systems.

Facebook reiterates they do not want users’ personal data and that they support regulation, elaborating, “We have policies that prohibit businesses from sending us sensitive data about people, including users’ health information or social security numbers, through business tools like the Facebook Pixel (a snippet of JavaScript code that allows you to track visitor activity on your website) and SDK (an Android-specific developers’ line of code which includes tracking and traffic analytics, and tracking of user behaviour and ads engagements).”

Social media and politics

Polarisation and populism have existed long before social media. This point may be a little ‘grey area’ simply because polarisation is still a fairly fluid term, where one can use it in both macro (platform integrity and diversity) and micro (smaller scale partisanship) senses.

Notably, The Social Dilemma addresses the scope of radicalisation through social media; in the film’s dramatised parallel storyline, a teen is exposed to a vague form of it through YouTube and Facebook.

“The overwhelming majority of the content that people see on Facebook is not polarising or even political — it’s everyday content from people’s friends and family,” Facebook states, “We reduce the amount of content that could drive polarisation, including links to clickbait headlines or misinformation.”

In May 2020, The Wall Street Journal published an exposé, based on internal documents and interviews with current and former employees, on how Facebook actually encourages divisiveness across its users. The article ‘Facebook Executives Shut Down Efforts to Make the Site Less Divisive’ states, ‘“Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness,’ read a slide from a 2018 presentation. ‘If left unchecked,’ it warned, Facebook would feed users ‘more and more divisive content to gain user attention and increase time on the platform.’” Facebook, not taking kindly to this article, published a report on their investments into reducing platform-specific polarisation, as they have done in this rebuttal to The Social Dilemma.

The aforementioned makes for a natural segue to elections and misinformation. “We’ve acknowledged that we made mistakes in 2016. Yet the film leaves out what we have done since 2016 to build strong defences to stop people from using Facebook to interfere in elections,” says the Facebook report, referring to its use of around 3000 Russian-backed ads which were then turned over to Congress.

In regards to the upcoming US Presidential election, Facebook explains, “We have policies prohibiting voter suppression and in the US, between March and May this year alone, we removed more than 1,00,000 pieces of Facebook and Instagram content for violating our voter interference policies,” and have also “updated our policies to counter attempts by a candidate or campaign to prematurely declare victory or delegitimise the election by questioning official results.”

Facebook states they do not benefit from misinformation, adding, “We don’t want hate speech on our platform and work to remove it... We know our systems aren’t perfect and there are things that we miss.” The company adds they have removed over 22 million pieces of hate speech in the second quarter of 2020, over 94% of which they found before someone reported it. They say this is an increase from a quarter earlier when they removed 9.6 million posts, over 88% of which they found before some reported it to the platform.

The Social Dilemma has stirred an online uprising around not just privacy but about mental health, and the power held by these companies. If the film’s mission was to further fracture our trust in the online, it has worked on a great many — and Facebook knows it. To be fair, many have questioned the film’s inherent purpose: ‘do we boycott these platforms altogether (is that even possible?)’, and ‘what can do about it now when erasing a digital footprint is near impossible?’

Facebook’s report aims to serve as a reminder of its positive (albeit slow) change after years of ongoing scandal and their regular statements of ‘we are working to change this’. Despite policy changes and international hearings, The Social Dilemma reminds us we need to perhaps reverse-engineer the situation, and start at home.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/cdtwqg/article32773291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/fbmarkweb,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/analysis-of-facebook-response-to-the-social-dilemma-netflix-documentary/article32773297.ece
23,2020/10/05,"‘Star Wars: Squadrons’ review: an excellent game, made better in VR","Experience Star Wars’ epic space battles from both sides in the latest Star Wars: Squadrons

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

One of my favourite moments of Star Wars was when Luke Skywalker takes on the Death Star in his X-wing fighter, expertly piloting it into the claustrophobic walls of the shaft with Darth Vader hot on his trail. Lightsabers aside, Star Wars has always been about the giant space battles, as tiny Tie Fighters and X-Wings zip in between Star Destroyers. This was something I’ve always wanted to do and classic games like X-Wing versus Tie Fighter allowed that.

Now, Star Wars: Squadrons — which launched on October 2 — presents a new chance to fly space fighters, both on screens and in VR.

Star Wars: Squadrons Developer: Motive Studios

Publisher: EA

Price: ₹2,499 on Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC

In the ensuing chaos after the events of Return of the Jedi, the Empire is in turmoil, and the Republic has a new lease on life, taking the fight to them. The story masterfully jumps between the Empire’s Titan Squadron and the Republic’s Vanguard Squadron as they fight for control and freedom respectively.

Yes, you play a relatively unknown pilot, but the characters you encounter are big-screen worth it.

Otherworldly details

The story is interesting, but the stakes never get high enough to capture you. It is mostly standard fare, and you only get to experience it when you are in the hangar.

However, the beauty of the game happens when you are in the seat of your fighter. Squadrons, as a game, captures the feel and scale of a Star Wars space battle perfectly. Your little window out into space from your claustrophobic cockpit makes everything more real; I found just manoeuvring to avoid a star destroyer only to find another massive ship jumping in front of me to be visceral.

Those familiar with the films would’ve seen the cockpits of these famous fighters, and the amount of detail that has gone into recreating them for Star Wars Squadrons is astounding. There are even tiny details like your pilot flicking little switches to bring the readouts to life. These details make dog-fighting a quasi-realistic experience as you glance at your readouts while manoeuvring to get your enemy in your sights.

Squadrons straddles that fine line between arcade style flying and fight simulation-like complexity. It is interesting how you can reroute power to your lasers or your shields or even your engines in the heat of the battle for that added defence or offense. The throttle is easy to use with the left stick, and things like de-accelerating quickly to make tight turns are critical to you not being blown to smithereens. As you play, you unlock the ability to set your own loadouts which is crucial to winning and finding your identity — especially in multi-player.

There is so much detail in each frame, with massive set pieces, that it is so easy to lose your target in the chaos. However, if you own a PlayStationVR or Oculus Quest, then this is the killer app that VR has been wanting for years. In this format the game takes on a whole new dimension. Turning your head lets you see the entire cockpit of the different spaceships you get to fly. Dogfights are made more real because you can make use of peripheral vision and all your senses to peel those layers of chaos. This game is best played in VR, and if you do own a flightstick, that is an added bonus.

Electronic Arts has been really doing their Star Wars games justice; from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order to Squadrons, they have taken the mythos a lot further with excellent storytelling and incredible gameplay. While we have covered mostly single player with Squadrons, it also does have a robust 5v5 multi-player which is as engaging.

24,2020/10/05,These podcasts will shake up your world view,"Novelist and podcaster Hari Kunzru shares his podcast picks, from Reply All to The Ballad of Billy Balls

Recently, Hari Kunzru spoke with MetroPlus about his new podcast Into The Zone (Pushkin Industries) which offer up personal dissections of the grey areas of life’s typical dichotomies: life and death, being a native and a migrant, and more.

This week, Hari shares the podcasts that have piqued his interest:

5-4

You may not think listening to American lawyers talking about Supreme Court decisions would make for the most compelling listening, but the three hosts are irreverent (and frankly foul-mouthed) and often hilarious.

They see the court, which plays such an outsized part in American public life, as a flawed, often deeply frustrating institution, and as you listen to them, you learn a great deal about how American politics came to be in the state it is today.

Deep Cover

True crime is the genre that made podcasting huge in America. It seems that now, there is not an unsolved murder that doesn’t have its own multi-part series.

Deep Cover is a story about an undercover FBI agent, who infiltrates a biker gang, trying to bring down a regional drug gang, and gradually discovers that his target is part of an international organisation, involving the then dictator of Panama, General Manuel Noriega.

Reply All

Podcasts are very dependent on the listener’s personal connection with the voice in their head.

Cover art for Reply All podcast

Reply All tells fascinating, deeply-researched stories from the world of technology, but it is also a window into the peculiar psyches of the hosts, who are funny, self-deprecating and work well together.

The Hidden Djinn

I’ve just started listening to this one, and it seems very promising.

The host, Rabia Chaudry, is a lawyer, well-known as to podcast listeners as one of the originators of Serial, the true-crime story that became a viral sensation. Now she has a chance to tell her listeners tales of the supernatural.

The Ballad of Billy Balls

Some stories are just made for podcasts.

This is a story of a family tragedy — the murder of a punk musician in ’80s New York. It is about what happens to the girlfriend he leaves behind, and to the child that woman eventually has.

25,2020/10/05,Self-taught bird photographer Bharat Chintapalli’s walk into the wild,"An Indian Forest officer, Bharat wants to document birds and understand the impact of climate change on their habitat and migration patterns

Birds are the heart and soul of Bharat Chintapalli’s photographs. An Indian Forest Officer posted as an attached officer at Jamui forest division in Bihar, Bharat’s plunge into bird photography was not planned. During his IFS probation days at Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA) in Dehradun, the faculty encouraged students to pick up a hobby. “It (bird photography) happened out of the blue; since our training had many tours, I thought the camera will be a nice companion,” he reminisces. When armed with a Nikon P900, he clicked a bird on the campus, but couldn’t identify it; he persisted with clicking birds to be able to identify. Soon, he was hooked to bird photography.

New hobby

A native of Visakhapatnam, the BITS-Pilani engineer began reading to identify birds’ family and understand its distribution maps. It was tough for a probation officer to take time out for a new hobby but using the break period to explore patches on campus helped. He went on to become the secretary of the wildlife club and also organised tours to wildlife areas during his training days.

The spark bird, a vulture he saw during a west India tour, created a life long interest in birds and to study the impact of climate change on them. “We saw a Chinkara carcass being ripped by vultures at the Dessert National Park in Rajasthan; that had a profound impact. Raptors or birds of prey, the strong migrating birds that come to India, soon became my interest; I began to see how climate change impacted their migration..”

The focus was also to study the risk of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) to raptors. He adds, “Not just NSAID drugs that bring down vulture population due to visceral gout but also a plunge in the population of eagles when a contaminated carcass is consumed.”

Bharat shares interactions with bird watchers on the link between climate change and birds: “Siberian cranes used to visit India. They were last seen in Bharatpur in Rajasthan in the early 2000s but with a rise in temperature, there is no record of their visit. Same with alpine birds, a common sight in Himachal Pradesh but now people see mynahs in those areas.”

Developing local communities can be one solution to adverse climate change. He gives an example of Bharatpur, where rickshaw wallahs turn into bird guides and spoke in different international languages to tourists. “As a native of Visakhapatnam, I know how plastic pollution impacts pelagic birds. Initiating community livelihood schemes can also help. Stopping hunting festivals organised in various parts of the country will also help. Conservation is a positive step to control the damage,” he continues.

Bharat mentions a video uploaded by an employee of Eastern Ghats Wild Life Society on finding masks and PPE kits on the Rushikonda beach in Visakhapatnam. “YouTube videos show how the plastic masks and PPE kits are now found in oceans. There was no tourism in the past six months, which reduced littering in these places, but we do not know if the situation has really improved.”

Over a span of 20 months, Bharat has photographed more than 330 birds. Now he explores the Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries in Bihar and documents his observations on eBird, the online database of bird observations. “I met so many hard-working wild lifers and ornithologists living in obscurity. They have published papers and journals but only few know about these ornithologists or the work they produced; Besides wanting to create visibility for them, I want to document as many birds as I can and understand the impact of climate change on their habitat and migration patterns.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/njxuj1/article32772501.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/birds3,https://www.thehindu.com/society/indian-forest-officer-bharat-chintapalli-wants-to-document-birds-and-understand-the-impacts-of-climate-change-on-their-habitat/article32772508.ece

33,2020/10/05,India has an “abiding interest” in resolving crisis in Rakhine State,"Foreign Secretary presents 3,000 vials of Remdesivir to State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi

India has an “abiding interest” in resolving the Rohingya refugee crisis which has disturbed the relationship between Myanmar and Bangladesh, an informed official source said. This information was shared with The Hindu after Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and the Chief of the Army Staff Gen. Manoj Naravane held meetings with the top politico-military leadership of Myanmar during October 4-5 visit.'

“India as a close friend, partner and neighbour of both Bangladesh and Myanmar has a deep and abiding interest to see an early stabilisation of the situation in the Rakhine State. India supports safe, sustainable and speedy repatriation of displaced persons from Bangladesh to Rakhine State based on the understanding between the two countries,” official sources familiar with the discussion between the visitors from India and the Myanmarese officials said on Monday.

The statement came at the end of the discussions. The Rohingya issue has become a difficult subject to resolve as Myanmar has sent additional forces to the Rakhine State that Dhaka has strongly objected to in the recent weeks.

India and Myanmar signed the Project Agreement for the upgradation of the Agricultural Mechanisation Sub-Station under the MoU on the Rakhine State Development Programme. The programme was signed in December 2017. Mr. Shringla also met U Soe Han, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Gen. Naravane met Commander in Chief of Defence Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and Vice Senior General Soe Win, Deputy Commander in Chief. Significantly, both sides agreed to the “operationalisation of Sittwe port in the Rakhine State in the first quarter of 2021”, the MEA said.

Mr. Shringla and Gen. Naravane also presented 3,000 vials of Remdesivir to State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi as a symbol of support in its struggle against the pandemic. Mr. Shringla hinted at India’s desire to ‘prioritise’ Myanmar in sharing vaccines against the pandemic.

“Myanmar appreciated India’s decision to provide debt service relief under the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative, up to December 31, 2020,” the MEA said. India declared a grant of $2 million for the construction of the border market (haat) bridge at Byanyu/Sarsichauk in Chin State which will provide greater connectivity between Mizoram and Myanmar. India also cleared 1.5 lakh tonnes of Urad dal (Vigna mungo) import from Myanmar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hn97d6/article32776648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHRINGLA-NARAVANE-MYANMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-has-an-abiding-interest-in-resolving-crisis-in-rakhine-state/article32776649.ece

Under fire for mishandling the Hathras case, the Uttar Pradesh police on Monday claimed that there was a “conspiracy” by some groups and individuals to instigate caste and communal violence in the State in the aftermath of the brutal gangrape and assault of a Dalit girl.

At least six FIRs have been lodged in Hathras, including one invoking sedition and criminal conspiracy, against persons and parties for allegedly trying to instigate the victim’s family, violating COVID-19 and Section 144 norms through illegal assemblies in and around the affected village, and for trying to spread caste discord through misleading statements, police said.

Additionally, 13 FIRs were lodged and five persons were arrested in Bijnor, Hathras, Saharanpur, Bulandshahr, Prayagraj, Ayodhya and Lucknow on charges of posting offensive statements over the incident on social media.

The U.P. police allegations came amidst charges of highhandedness levelled against it by Opposition parties who have faced difficulties in trying to meet the family of the victim over the last week.

On Sunday, police lathicharged RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary and his colleagues while they were on way to meet the family. Police had also used force against SP workers and booked members of the Bhim Army.

The police narrative that there was a “conspiracy” over the issue came a day after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had claimed, while hinting at the role of Opposition parties, that those who do not like development, “want to trigger caste and communal riots in the State as well as in the country”.

Mr. Adityanath, without taking names, had alleged that his opponents were indulging in “newer conspiracies” to derive political mileage.

In an official statement, U.P. police said even though the government had recommended a CBI probe into the matter, some groups and individuals wanted to create a frenzy by triggering communal and caste violence and discord to defame the government. The police, also without specifically naming anyone, claimed groups were circulating misleading and malicious information on social media and violating prohibitory orders through unnecessary assembly near the house and village of the victim.

36,2020/10/05,External Affairs Minister Jaishankar heads for Tokyo for Quad meeting,"Beijing has criticised meeting as an ‘exclusive clique’

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will meet the other foreign ministers of the Australia-India-Japan-United States Quadrilateral or Quad in Tokyo on Tuesday, which is seen as a significant turning point for the grouping, led by growing concerns over China in the region.

Officials aware of the agenda say that cooperation on 5G connectivity, cybersecurity, a supply chain initiative for manufacturing, maritime cooperation and infrastructure and connectivity, as well as distribution plans for the COVID-19 vaccine are all areas where alternatives to Chinese initiatives will be discussed.

Beijing has already criticised the meeting as an “exclusive clique”, “an anti-China front line” and even a “mini-NATO” led by the U.S.’s “cold war mentality”, making it clear it will watch the outcomes closely, even as its tensions with each of the Quad countries grows.

Malabar exercise

The meeting on Tuesday will begin with a “regional assessment”, including developments in the South and East China Sea, the six-month stand-off at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Hong Kong and Taiwan, where China’s aggressive moves have been most marked. The four ministers will also discuss the issue of including Australia in the next edition of the Malabar naval exercises, scheduled to be held in November. However, there is still no clarity on the final decision. Any announcement on Malabar would be made by the Ministry of Defence, a government official said.

Building trade ties is also on the agenda, as Japan is keen to push a plan for a trilateral “Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI)” with India and Australia to reduce dependence on Chinese manufacturing, especially as India has refused to be a part of the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

India will also discuss how other Quad countries can help with building “East-West” connectivity from India to ASEAN countries, to counter the “North-South connectivity” from China, as well as joint funding for infrastructure and connectivity projects in the Indo-Pacific region. A U.S. plan for a “Blue Dot Network” to rate infrastructure projects for funding, announced in January, is likely to be discussed as well.

Bilateral meetings

Mr. Jaishankar will also hold bilateral meetings with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and his Australian and U.S. counterparts Marise Payne and Mike Pompeo separately during his two-day Tokyo visit, where bilateral defence cooperation will be a common theme.

Each of the foreign ministers had made a special effort to attend this meeting, said diplomatic sources, indicating that the Trump administration was particularly keen to hold the meeting before U.S. elections next month so that a common understanding on China, as well as the road map for the future year could be reached.

Secretary of State Mr. Pompeo is travelling despite health concerns over President Donald Trump, who is in hospital with COVID-19. Mr. Pompeo has cancelled trips to Seoul and Ulan Bator scheduled this week, but could reschedule later this month, when he is expected to travel to Delhi for the “2+2” Foreign-Defence Ministers’ meetings.

Ms. Payne, who has only travelled to the U.S. during the pandemic, given Australia’s strict “no exemption” two-week quarantine rule, is making a special effort to attend as well, as is Mr. Jaishankar, whose only other visit has been to Moscow for the SCO (Shangai Cooperation Organisation) summit and to meet with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi.

Japan’s special push

Japan itself made a special push to host the meeting, which was earlier due to take place in Delhi, as the new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is keen to show his commitment to the Quad process, which was conceived by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

While the Quadrilateral has thus far met at joint secretary levels twice a year since it was revived in 2017, the foreign ministers only met once before on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in 2019, and are likely to discuss making talks at this level a more permanent feature.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/wyz5zb/article32776482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06JAISHANKARNEWS3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/external-affairs-minister-jaishankar-heads-for-tokyo-for-quad-meeting/article32775986.ece

The Translational Health Science And Technology Institute (THSTI), an autonomous institute of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), has been chosen by the international non-profit, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), as one of the ‘Global network of Laboratories for centralized assessment of COVID-19 Vaccines’.

The CEPI network will initially involve six labs, one each in Canada, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Bangladesh and India. All the labs would use the same reagents and follow a common set of protocols to measure the immune response of multiple vaccine candidates under development and trial. “This will greatly harmonise the vaccine trial process and allow different vaccine candidates to be compared and speed up the selection of the most effective candidate,” the DBT said in a statement on Monday,

The Ind-CEPI mission for the establishment of BSL-3 (Bio-safety level 3) facility, is a translational laboratory for platform technologies and a Bioassay laboratory for development of assays to measure clinical immunogenicity. The mandate of the bioassay laboratory at the THSTI is to provide validated assays for vaccine development on a par with global standards.

Dr. Renu Swarup, Secretary, DBT, said in a statement: “The DBT has been supporting efforts for COVID-19 vaccine development and testing. More than 30 vaccines are at different stages of development with three in human trials and nearly four in advanced stages of preclinical testing.”

Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said that according to current projections, about 25 crore Indians are likely to be vaccinated by July next.

38,2020/10/05,Bengaluru firm bags U.S. funding for anti-bacterial research,"GangaGen Biotechnologies will develop novel antibacterial proteins to combat drug-resistant infections

With COVID-19 throwing focus on microbes and their interaction with the environment, Boston University based non-profit CARB-X said it is awarding up to $2.5 million (about ₹18 crore) to Bengaluru-based biotech firm GangaGen Biotechnologies, to develop novel antibacterial proteins that could potentially be used to treat multi-drug resistant infections.

These proteins called klebicins, can be used to treat pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, a difficult-to-treat bacteria.

President of GangaGen Biotechnologies Tanjore S Balganesh said: “We are delighted to receive CARB-X’s support to progress the klebicin programme. K. pneumoniae is a hard-to-treat pulmonary pathogen resistant to many of the current antibiotics. Additionally, hypervirulent strains of the pathogen are being isolated in many parts of the globe.”

GangaGen is developing klebicins, which are naturally occurring protein antibiotics, as precision agents to target K. pneumoniae. Klebicins’ novel mechanism of action enables specific killing of the target pathogen without impacting the microbiome, the confluence of helpful microbes usually found in the gut that are necessary for healthy living.

The klebicins have shown potent activity against K. pneumoniae in vivo (animal) studies. The CARB-X award will support further discovery, protein engineering and development of potent klebicins for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by K. pneumoniae.

“GangaGen is researching a highly innovative approach to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae, including the carbapenem-resistant and Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase (ESBL)-expressing strains of particular clinical concern,” said R&D Chief of CARB-X Erin Duffy. “The project is in the early stages of development and if successful, it could represent progress in the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.”

K. pneumoniae presents a serious health challenge around the world and is of increasing concern in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where it causes life-threatening infections such as pneumonia and neonatal sepsis.

In addition to supporting project development, the funding will also support collaboration with academic institutions and hospital-based research institutions in India to address the susceptibility of people living in Asia to K. pneumoniae, CARB-X said in a press release.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/g8b7ir/article32775085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GangaGen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bengaluru-firm-bags-us-funding-for-anti-bacterial-research/article32775086.ece
39,2020/10/05,Hathras: SC to hear today plea for CBI or SIT probe,"Trial of the accused should be shifted to Delhi, says the petition

A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde will on Tuesday hear a writ petition seeking a CBI or Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe into the brutal gangrape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh.

The petition filed by Delhi-based activist Satyama Dubey, through advocate Sanjeev Malhotra, said the investigation should be monitored by a former Supreme Court or High Court judge. It said the trial of the accused persons should be shifted to Delhi.

Ms. Dubey said a fair investigation should encompass the circumstances after the victim’s death at the Safdarjung Hospital, including media reports about the police rushing through a midnight cremation in the absence of her family. The family alleged that they were not allowed to perform her last rites.

The case has created a public furore with the National Human Rights Commission issuing notice to the Uttar Pradesh administrative and police establishments. The Delhi Commission for Women chief has already written to the CJI to take suo motu cognisance of the case. The State government has set up a fast-track court.

“The police authorities had not performed their duties towards the victim and are trying to shield the accused persons for reasons best known to them… The family of the victim was victimised by upper-caste persons and no action has been taken by the authorities or the police,” the petition said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m3fafx/article32753866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hathras-sc-to-hear-today-plea-for-cbi-or-sit-probe/article32774821.ece

They have to ensure availability of full-time trained health care attendant, nurse or doctor and counsellor to take care of the physical and mental health of students. Regular health check-up of students and teachers has to be organised. The schools have to adopt a flexible attendance and sick leave policies and encourage the students and staff to stay at home when sick.

The schools should focus on the most vulnerable students, including those with special needs and those directly affected by death or hospitalisation due to COVID-19 in their family. Directives have been given to ensure nutritional requirements of the children.

Instructions have also been issued on the academic aspects including curriculum, timetables and assessment. They are advisory in nature and the States and the UTs may use them in the manner deemed fit to prepare their own guidelines.

The Ministry has advised making of a comprehensive alternative calendar of activities for the whole year with focus on learning outcomes. A comprehensive academic plan can be prepared as per the orders from the respective Directorate of Education. The plan may follow the Alternative Academic Calendar guideline prepared by the NCERT.

“Reintegration of students into school may be taken on priority after reopening...teachers must polish their skills for integrating ICT in class as far as possible. Training modules may be prepared for the same,” the note said, adding that teachers must discuss with students the clear roadmap of the curriculum, mode of learning and other related issues.

Also Read | No study conducted to assess impact of COVID-19 on mental health: Govt.

Srinivas Rajkumar T, senior resident, Department of Psychiatry and National Drug De-addiction Treatment Centre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said: “We are already seeing a surge of patients coming with depression, anxiety , insomnia. Due to the economic impact, patients may find it hard to access mental health services and any pandemic has a long term impact on mental health. But COVID is peculiar as the very social nature of existence of man is compromised.”

Isolation factor

Isolation from previous groups, activities would persist for many, more so for the elderly people who already have restricted social circles, he stated.

“Children will lose vital connection with their peers and may resort to unhealthy modes of communication. To minimise the mental health impact, the vulnerable groups can be made to actively participate in safe social activities like walking /cycling in groups with adequate distance and safety,’’ he observed.

Experts have suggested that people maintain a regular ‘to do’ list and seek help and reach out to friends and family through safer avenues.

Dr. Rajkumar said, “Minimise exposure to unverified news/Whatsapp and instead focus on reading novels, poems etc is vital’’.

Vulnerable category

Identifying persons with previous mental illness as a vulnerable category during the pandemic, the Union Health Ministry has reiterated that this section of the population “may face newer challenges during self-isolation or COVID-19 infection and that they would also have the same fears and stress as others which may worsen their previous mental health condition’’.

The Ministry in a three-page note on “Minding our minds during the COVID-19’’, also cautioned that the most common emotion faced by all is fear. “It makes us anxious, panicky and can even possibly make us think, say or do things that we might not consider appropriate under normal circumstances,’’ it said.

A senior health official said, “The document is aimed at helping the general public understand that knowledge is power and that we should stick to the known advice of hand- hygiene and keeping a physical distance from others. It is being careful about yourself, and also about care of others that matters’’.

WHO survey

The WHO said in its survey, “The pandemic is increasing demand for mental health services. Bereavement, isolation, loss of income and fear are triggering mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones. Many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use, insomnia, and anxiety. Meanwhile, COVID-19 itself can lead to neurological and mental complications, such as delirium, agitation, and stroke. People with pre-existing mental, neurological or substance use disorders are also more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection - they may stand a higher risk of severe outcomes and even death’’.

The survey was conducted from June to August 2020 among 130 countries across the WHO’s six regions. It evaluated how the provision of mental, neurological and substance use services has changed due to COVID-19, the types of services that have been disrupted, and how countries are adapting to overcome these challenges.

44,2020/10/05,Coronavirus | Govt. campaign to spread awareness about ‘appropriate Covid-19 behaviour’,"The program is planned in the wake of the upcoming festive season and further relaxation of lockdown norms.

The Union government will soon roll out a renewed campaign that aims to spread awareness about “appropriate COVID-19 behaviour” in view of the forthcoming festive season and further unlocking of public activities, officials said on Monday.

Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla is expected to chair a meeting to chart out the new plan on Tuesday at 3 p.m. in the North Block office of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

The meeting, a senior Home Ministry official told PTI, will see the participation of senior officials of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, chiefs of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), field offices of the Home Ministry and few others.

“The meeting is being held to discuss ways to increase the campaign for appropriate COVID-19 behaviour in the country,” the officer said.

“A new or enhanced public campaign for ensuring self-sanitisation, physical distancing and wearing of masks is essential as the Centre has recently issued guidelines for further opening up of public facilities that allows more social activities,” the officer said.

Also, we are getting into a long festive season with Deepawali and other festivals lined up and hence it is required that public messaging about coronavirus protocols is stepped up and renewed, he said.

He said the meeting will discuss these issues and chart out a public health response that can be implemented across the country in the wake of the COVID-19 spread.

The new campaign or to say extension of the already running public campaigns will be taken forward by all the information and communication dissemination wings of the government and various agencies, he said.

The ministry, on September 30, had issued new guidelines for permitting more activities in areas outside COVID-19 containment zones that include opening up cinemas, theatres and multiplexes with up to 50% of their seating capacity from October 15.

State governments and Union Territories have been given the flexibility to decide on re-opening schools and coaching institutions after October 15 in a graded manner, and permitting social, religious and political gatherings beyond the limit of 100 people, subject to certain conditions, as part of these guidelines issued by the MHA under the provisions of the disaster management Act.

A country-wide lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from March 25 and it was extended in phases till May 31 to check the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

The unlock process in the country had begun on June 1 with the graded reopening of commercial, social, religious and other activities.

The total coronavirus cases mounted to 66,23,815 with 74,442 people testing positive for the infection in a day, while the death toll climbed to 1,02,685 with the virus claiming 903 lives in a span of 24 hours, the latest government data said.

45,2020/10/05,"Rise in criminals cases against sitting, former lawmakers; need strict monitoring, says report filed in Supreme Court","The total number of cases against sitting and former lawmakers are 4,859 as per a new report, while it was 4,442 in March 2020, the top court was apprised of in a report filed before it.

Criminal cases against sitting and former lawmakers have increased over the last two years and strict monitoring at the micro level is needed by high courts to ensure expeditious disposal of cases against them, the Supreme Court was informed on Monday.

The total number of cases against sitting and former lawmakers are 4,859 as per a new report, while it was 4,442 in March 2020, the top court was apprised of in a report filed before it.

“The number of cases pending against MPs/MLAs (sitting and former) have increased over the last two years despite monitoring for expeditious disposal in the present proceedings.

“It is, therefore, submitted that strict monitoring, at a micro-level, by the High Courts is necessary to ensure expeditious disposal of the cases against legislators,” said the report filed by senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, assisted by advocate Sneha Kalita.

The report has been submitted in a petition filed in 2016 by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Upadhyay and raised the issue of inordinately delay in disposal of criminal cases against former and sitting lawmakers.

The report stated that some high courts favoured constitution of Special Courts in each district, both at Sessions and Magisterial level.

“Many other High Courts have favoured trial by the respective jurisdictional courts with a mandate to take these cases on a priority basis. In some of the States, the High Courts have recommended constitution of zone-wise Special Courts.

“The High Courts have recommended the appointment of Nodal Prosecution Officer and Special Public prosecutor for each of the court and have written to the State governments in this regard,” the report said.

All the High Courts have favoured setting up of Safe and Secure Witness Examination Room with video-conference facility citing lack of infrastructure facilities and non-availability of funds for this, the amicus curiae told the court.

“No status report has been filed by the Union of India with respect to initiation and current stage of cases against the legislators pending before CBI, Enforcement Directorate and other Central agencies, the grant of sanction and expected time for completion,” the report said.

There are 25 cases pending at sessions level and 62 at magistrate level in Delhi which include matters under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the like.

“The High Court is considering establishing four Special Courts, two at Sessions level and two at Magistrate level. A suo motu writ petition has been registered to monitor the trials and directions have been issued to list pending matters before the respective Benches of the High Court,” the report said.

The report suggested that one special court at Bengaluru, which includes the number of cases under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 for the trial of 165 cases is not sufficient for disposal of cases.

The witnesses have to travel from long distance for participating in the trial which will affect a fair trial, it said, adding that “this court may direct the High Court to revisit its proposal to establish only one additional Court at Bengaluru”.

“Instead, it will be more appropriate to assign cases to the respective jurisdictional courts with a mandate to try the cases on a priority basis. Other cases may be allotted to such courts only having regard to the workload,” the report said.

Referring to West Bengal, the report said one Special Court at Barasat, 24 North Pargana is not sufficient for a trial of all 134 cases and if cases relate to different parts of the State, it will be inconvenient for witnesses to travel to Barasat to give evidence.

The report suggested that the High Court may be requested to establish more number of Special Courts. With regard to Tamil Nadu, the report of the High Court shows that in 92 cases stay has been granted; however, the present action plan report does not indicate as to the steps taken for disposal of cases under stay.

Regarding Uttar Pradesh, the report said that Special Court at Allahabad has 12 adjoining districts and has 300 cases and expeditious disposal may not be possible of these cases in one Special Court. “Thus, High Court may be requested to constitute Special Courts in the adjoining districts of Allahabad to lessen the burden of the Special Court at Allahabad.

“There are 85 cases of stay by the High Court. The Chief Justice of the High Court may be requested to constitute a special Bench(s) for these cases. The High Court has pointed out that in some cases the accused persons are in other districts/ States, which is an obstacle in speedy disposal of cases,” it said.

The U.P. government may be directed to equip these courts electronically so that trial can proceed through video-conferencing without the physical presence of the accused, the report said.

Pointing to Kerala High Court’s submission stating that police personnel are reluctant to arrest and produce legislators, the report said that it may be directed that the SP of the concerned district will be personally responsible for the execution of warrants.

“Similarly, if any legislator despite receipt of summons/warrant does not appear before the court, he/she will be liable for contempt of this Court apart from disciplinary proceedings,” it said.

In Punjab and Haryana, the trial of eight cases in Haryana and 10 cases in Punjab have been stayed by the High Court; however, the action plan does not show steps taken to list and dispose of such cases expeditiously, the report said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aldt76/article32192489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-supreme-court-of-india,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rise-in-criminal-cases-against-sitting-former-lawmakers-need-strict-monitoring-says-report-filed-in-supreme-court/article32773713.ece

47,2020/10/05,"Extradition: Come clean about ‘confidential’ proceedings in U.K., SC tells Mallya","Clarify by Nov. 2 when you will appear to accept sentence for contempt, says court.

The Supreme Court on Monday ordered the lawyers for businessman Vijay Mallya to come clean about the nature of ‘confidential’ proceedings going on after the rejection of his appeal against extradition in the U.K. Supreme Court.

At the start of the hearing, the government informed a Special Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Ashok Bhushan that Mr. Mallya’s extradition case in the U.K. is over, but some ‘secret’ proceedings is on.

“Extradition was ordered by the highest court of the UK. But it [extradition] is not happening. Instead, some ‘secret’ proceedings are happening. We have not been made aware of these proceedings. We are not a party. They [Mr. Mallya’s side] have not served us with anything,” advocate Rajat Nair, appearing for the government submitted.

Justice Lalit turned to Mr. Mallya’s counsel and asked him to explain the nature of this confidential proceedings. But the lawyer said he would have to first take instructions on this issue.

“We want to know what is going on? What is pending there now,” Justice Lalit asked the lawyer.

The court ordered Mr. Mallya’s side to clarify by November 2 the nature of this confidential proceedings, when it will end and by when the businessman will appear before it to accept his sentence for contempt.

On August 30, the apex court had dismissed Mr. Mallya’s review petition against a May 9, 2017 verdict of contempt.

The court had found no merit in his three-year-old review plea against his conviction.

The court had in May 2017 found Mr. Mallya guilty of contempt for wilful disobedience of its order to come clean about his assets and not disclosing $40 million (₹600 crore) he received from British liquor major Diageo Plc following his resignation as Chairman of the United Spirits Limited in February 2016.

In his original arguments before the apex court in 2017, Mr. Mallya had informed the court that the $40 million was one among “thousands of transactions” he did and cannot be counted as an asset. He said he had no control over that money now as he had already disbursed it among his three adult children, who are U.S. citizens.

Countering allegations made by a banking consortium led by the SBI which had filed the contempt of court petition against him, Mr. Mallya said he had already given a complete list of assets as of March 31, 2016. The court had ordered him to provide the banks with a list of his assets so that they could recover ₹9,200 crore due to them.

The banks had sought contempt action against Mr. Mallya arguing that the disbursal of the $40 million among his three children was in direct violation of a standing Karnataka High Court order that none of his assets should be “alienated, disposed of or be subjected to the creation of third party rights”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kgmlgq/article32673129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22th-pti-mallyaG8B7PL1B93jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/extradition-come-clean-about-confidential-proceedings-in-uk-sc-tells-mallya/article32773153.ece

Considering the sensitivity of the matter, our Chairperson @sharmarekha has sought a reply from @dgpup at the earliest,” the NCW tweeted.

“A copy of the letter has also been sent to @dmgbnagar and #DCP, Police Commissionerate, #GautamBuddhNagar,” it said in another tweet.

The incident had occurred at the Delhi-U.P. border when Priyanka Gandhi Vadra along with other Congress leaders, including her brother Rahul Gandhi, was on her way to Hathras on Saturday afternoon to meet the family of the woman who died after she was allegedly gang-raped.

There were scuffles involving Congress workers and the Gautam Buddh Nagar police during which she was allegedly manhandled.

In the melee, a helmet-wearing policeman had held the 48-year-old Congress general secretary by her kurta at the DND toll plaza while a crowd surrounded them.

The Dalit woman was allegedly raped in a Hathras village by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital where she succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday.

She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night.

Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l2evp5/article32760929.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PriyankaGandhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ncw-seeks-explanation-from-up-police-over-manhandling-of-priyanka-gandhi/article32773041.ece
49,2020/10/05,Congress terms tax raids on Shivakumar a ‘witch-hunt’,"It asks why corruption charges against Yeddyurappa are not investigated by CBI

The Congress on Monday termed the CBI raids on Karnataka Congress president D.K. Shivakumar a ‘witch-hunt’ and asked why the investigation agency was not acting on alleged corruption charges against the State Chief Minister, B.S. Yeddyurappa and his family.

Congress general secretary in charge of Karnataka, Randeep Surjewala, tweeted, “The insidious game of intimidation and machinations of Modi-Yeddyurappa duo being executed by a puppet CBI by raiding @DKShivakumar won’t deter us. CBI should be unearthing the layers of corruption in Yeddyurappa Govt. But, ‘Raid Raj’ is their only ‘Machiavellian Move’!”.

Mr. Surjewala, who is also the Congress’s chief spokesperson, targeted the investigation agencies as well.

“Let Modi and Yeddyurappa Governments and BJP’s frontal organizations i.e CBI-ED-Income Tax know that Congress workers and leaders will not be cowed down nor bow down before such devious attempts. Our resolve to fight for people and expose BJP’s maladministration only becomes stronger”, he stated.

At the party’s regular press conference, senior leader Sushmita Dev linked the raids to coming by-elections in Karnataka and asserted that the organisation stood behind Mr. Shivakumar.

“We would like to ask the CBI: why is that you wake up everytime there is an election or a by-election? Are you not acting like a stooge of this government?” asked Ms. Dev, a former Lok Sabha member.

PM’s slogan on graft

Ms. Dev pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given slogan “na khaunga na khaane dunga” (will neither indulge in corruption nor will allow one to do so), and asked him to explain why there had been no investigation against Mr. Yeddyurappa's family members whose names had surfaced in connection with alleged irregularities concerning a government housing project.

“It’s a shame on the Prime Minister of India, the Home Minister of India and the BJP that today you continue to shield your corrupt Chief Minister and his son, son in-law and grandson in the ₹665 crore scam, which you deliberately do not want to investigate. We demand an inquiry into Yediyurappa Ji’s family corruption,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-terms-tax-raids-on-shivakumar-a-witch-hunt/article32772885.ece
50,2020/10/05,Javadekar moots PPP model for better upkeep of zoos,"The Minister said that State governments and corporations will also be involved in this plan.

The government will come up with a plan to improve and expand zoos in the country through public-private partnership, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Monday.

Speaking at an online event ‘Wildlife Week 2020’, he said that funds will be allocated for the plan and it will be announced in the budget session next year.

“Children like visiting zoos and to enhance their experience, these facilities must be maintained properly. There are 160 zoos in the country. We will soon come up with a new plan for upgradation and expansion of zoos across the country and we will set aside a budget for it, which will be announced in the next year’s budget session,” Mr. Javadekar said.

The Minister said that State governments and corporations will also be involved in this plan.

Economic valuation

During the online event, Mr. Javadekar also released a report based on the total economic valuation of the Delhi National Zoological Park. The report was prepared by by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and the Central Zoo Authority (CZA).

The total economic value of ecosystem services provided by Delhi’s National Zoological Park for 2019-2020 stood at ₹422.76 crore, according to the report.

The ecosystem services provided by the zoological park are bio-diversity conservation, carbon storage and sequestration, employment generation, education and research, and recreational and cultural.

The report stated that 77% of the ₹422.76 crore came from recreational and cultural services, and the amount stood at ₹324.33 crore.

Education and research services contributed 9% or ₹37.60 crore to the total economic value.

While employment generation contributed 8% or ₹32.19 crore, the contribution of bio-diversity was 6% or ₹27.33 crore.

The least contribution was found in carbon sequestration which was 0.31% or ₹1.31 crore of the total economic value of ecosystem services provided by the Delhi Zoo in 2019-2020.

“Irrespective of the contributions, every service is important as it contributes towards the improvement of the local environment. The benefits of the zoo are not only restricted to its visitors but also reach Delhi’s citizens. Hence, it is necessary to ensure proper maintenance of the zoo to improve its services,” the report stated.

Zoological parks in India are unique ecosystems that provide numerous services of local and national significance. Besides their primary function in education and research, many zoos serve as natural habitats for free-ranging animals.

“Moreover, such parks are sources of carbon sequestration, air purification, water purification, noise attenuation etc,” the report said.

Spread across 176 acres, the National Zoological Park in Delhi is home to several species of mammals, birds and reptiles.

“As of 2018, there are 40 species of endangered animals under Schedule I and II categories; 35 species of animals under Schedule III and IV categories; and 29 species of exotic animals as specified under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Apart from enclosures for wild animals and administrative buildings, the zoo sustains a natural environment in its campus which provides habitat for several free-ranging floral and faunal species,” the report said.

The CZA had requested TERI to conduct the study that aims at understanding the annual value of the key ecosystem services, the report said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mp08zi/article32683957.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAVADEKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/javadekar-moots-ppp-model-for-better-upkeep-of-zoos/article32772679.ece
51,2020/10/05,IAF well-positioned to take on China: Air Chief,"ACM Bhadauria, however, notes that they are not underestimating the adversary.

Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal (ACM) RKS Bhadauria on Monday asserted that India is fully prepared for a two-front war. “We are ready and very well-positioned to take on China and there is no scenario where they can get the better of us”, he said.

“Next three months will depend on how the talks progress. Current progress is slow; what we see is an effort to dig in for the winter... We are talking action accordingly. Our further action will depend on the ground realities,” he observed at the annual press conference ahead of the 88th Air Force Day.

The Air Force had the capability to “shoot first and strike deep and hard” as it was “very well-positioned,” he stated.

ACM Bhadauria, however, noted that they were not underestimating the adversary. “Their [China] strength lies in surface-to-air systems they have put up in the area. They have long missile systems. We cater to those in our matrix... We can take on that threat”.

Deployment along LAC

On deployment in Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with the ongoing stand-off for five months now, the Indian Air Force (IAF) chief said Ladakh was a small part of the Air Force’s deployment. “We have deployed to all relevant areas. We are firmly and strongly deployed to take on any scenarios”.

He said they realised what the Chinese were doing in May. “It is not correct to say we were surprised. It showed our ability to respond and there was no delay”.

On Chinese air activity along the LAC, he stated that there was no step-up in deployments after the initial developments. “It has remained largely the same.”

Talking of the collusive threat on the northern and western borders, he pointed to full preparations to meet all contingencies, including a simultaneous two-front war with China and Pakistan. “We are aware they are cooperating closely There is significant threat. But so far there is no such indication that they are colluding for a two-front war,” he observed.

Asked if there was any moment during the stand-off where they came clsoe to an air strike, he said ‘no’, while adding, “We were prepared.”

Global support for India

To questions on global support for India in the ongoing stand-off and possible cooperation with the U.S., he pointed out that they made their plans on their own. “We have to fight our own wars.”

The Air Force had operationalised the recently acquired Rafale jets, Chinook and Apache helicopters in record time. “Next three years, we will see our Rafale and Light Combat Aircraft (LCA)-Mk1 squadrons in full strength,” he stated.

On the falling fighter squadron strength of the Air Force, he said that if they touched 36-37 squadrons by this decade-end, it was very good.

Modernisation

On budgetary constraints for modernisation, he said they would have an impact in due course over the next couple of years but there was no impact on the current capability. “We have done a reprioritisation exercise”.

ACM Bhadauria didn’t comment on any immediate order for more Rafale jets but said their immediate focus was on signing the contract for 83 LCA-Mk1A than the tender for 114 jets. Stressing on indigenous efforts, he said the IAF was looking at close to 450 ‘Make in India’ aircraft of various types in the next 10-15 years. The Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) would be the mainstay of the Air Force in the next decade or so, he asserted.

On the increasing utilisation of drones, including the armed ones, and their applicability for India, he said drones were important for ‘intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance’. “Their role in the initial build-up is very important. But once the build-up happens, they become susceptible”, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2v3721/article32771528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHADAURIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/china-cant-get-better-of-us-iaf-chief-bhadauria-on-eastern-ladakh/article32771529.ece
52,2020/10/05,"Loans: SC questions Centre, RBI on panel report implementation","Bench notes that additional affidavit filed by govt late last week did not address “several issues” raised in pleas highlighting borrowers’ plight

The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Union government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) about the steps taken to implement the K.V. Kamath Committee report on recommendations to bail out sectors affected by the COVID-19 stress.

A Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan noted that an additional affidavit filed by the government late last week did not address “several issues” raised in writ petitions highlighting the plight of borrowers, small and big, who were being charged compound interest, post the pandemic moratorium, which expired on August 31.

‘Hand-hold’ small borrowers

The additional affidavit informed the Supreme Court about the government’s decision to “hand-hold” small and vulnerable borrowers and waive the compound interest (interest on interest) accumulated against their loans during the six-month moratorium period. But the waiver of compound interest is only applicable for loans up to ₹2 crore, the Ministry of Finance told the court.

The waiver will be for MSME, education, housing, consumer durables, credit card, auto, personal and consumption loans, all up to ₹2 crore. But the court recorded in the order submissions made that the government and the RBI were yet to issue notifications or circulars to implement the waiver.

During the hearing, the court went on to ask the government whether it had so far issued any circulars, policy decisions and so on, based on the Kamath panel report, which has made suggestions for a loan resolution or restructuring scheme for 26 pandemic-distressed sectors.

‘Real estate left out’

Senior advocate Aryama Sundaram said the real estate sector had been completely left out.

The court said the government and the RBI had brought nothing on record to show what been done to implement the Kamath panel report. At one point, Justice Bhushan asked why the report itself had not been placed on record in the court.

“We have nothing to hide. We will put it on record. It [report] is available in the public domain,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for both the government and the RBI, replied.

Senior advocate V. Giri, also for the RBI, said the government was deliberating on further improvements in the loan resolution plans. Charging of compound interest post moratorium had hit hard the ordinary person, he acknowledged.

He assured the court that the report would be placed on record.

‘Issue circulars’

The court said it was not just about placing the report on record, but implementing it. The RBI and the government should issue circulars so that people knew what benefits had been extended to them.

“It will be done,” the government and RBI sides responded.

“When will it be done... This has been going on for long. There is need for a proper restructuring scheme,” Justice M.R. Shah, on the Bench, said.

The court found there was no resolution or policy decision, by individual banks, on the manner in which they should implement the various decisions taken by the Centre and the RBI.

Salve seeks time

Senior advocate Harish Salve, for the Indian Banks’ Association, sought time to place on record the individual policy decisions of each bank. “Whatever the relief, the weight of it will fall on the banks”, he said.

Justice Shah observed said, “We are trying to strike a balance here”.

The court allowed the parties to file their replies to the additional affidavit in a week. The Centre has to place on record the Kamath panel report along with circulars, policy decisions, if any, on the issue.

53,2020/10/05,"U.N. comments on Hathras, Balrampur cases ‘unwarranted’, says MEA","It is essential that authorities ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice speedily, the UN in India says

The government reacted sharply to a statement by the UN resident Coordinator in India Renata Lok-Dessallien, who had expressed concern over the cases of alleged rapes of young girls in Hathras and Balrampur, calling the statement ‘unwarranted’.

“The U.N. Resident Coordinator in India should be aware that these cases have been taken extremely seriously by the government. Since the investigation process is still under way, any unnecessary comments by an external agency are best avoided,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.

Editorial | Undying embers: On Hathras rape

In an extremely rare statement made by the U.N. in Delhi, which doesn’t often comment critically on internal matters, the Coordinator described the deaths of the two girls belonging to the Dalit community in Uttar Pradesh as ‘atrocities’, making a specific mention of the fact that they belonged to “disadvantaged social groups”.

“The recent cases of alleged rape and murder in Hathras and Balrampur are another reminder that despite the impressive progress made on a number of social indicators, women and girls from disadvantaged social groups face additional vulnerabilities and are at greater risk of gender-based violence,” said the U.N. statement. “It is essential that authorities ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice speedily, and that families be empowered to seek timely justice, social support, counselling, healthcare and rehabilitation. Entrenched social norms and behaviour of men and boys that lead to gender based violence must be addressed.”

However, Ms. Lok-Dessallien said steps taken by the government on safety measures for women and girls are “welcome and urgent”, adding that the UN “supports the Prime Minister’s call for strict action against the culprits”.

In his rejoinder, Mr. Srivastava said “the Constitution guarantees equality to all citizens.

56,2020/10/05,Jagan should make a strong caseat Apex Council meet: BJP,"‘Every effort should be made to get fair share of water for State’

The State unit of the BJP has suggested to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to make strong arguments in favour of the projects on the Krishna and Godavari rivers at the Apex Council meeting scheduled to be held on October 6.

In a press release, the party suggested that the Chief Minister should speak about the projects like Palamuru-Ranga Reddy Lift Irrigation (LI) scheme in view of the tough posturing by his Telangana counterpart K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the proposed Rayalaseema LI and other projects.

The party observed that Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao made an in-depth study of the utilisation of the Krishna and Godavari river waters during the agitation for Statehood to Telangana.

A string of LI projects were undertaken by the Telangana government after the new State came into existence, but neither the then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu nor his successor uttered a word about its due to their compulsions.

Taking advantage of his cordial relationship with Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy should at least now talk to him about lifting water from Pothireddypadu head regulator for the benefit of the Rayalaseema region which has the potential to be transformed into a granary and an industrial hub if the river waters were taken to its dry lands.

The BJP demanded that Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao should give up his hostile attitude towards the Central government and condemned objectionable comments which he continued to make on AP and the Centre even after bifurcation.

A 30-year-old woman worker, who was two months pregnant, was killed on the spot and a 70-year-old COVID-19 patient was critically injured, when the roof of a floor under construction at an extension building collapsed on them at the SVIMS Padmavathi COVID Hospital in Tirupati on Sunday night.

“When a COVID patient arrived at portico, Ms. Radhika rushed to attend the case and in just a couple of minutes, tragedy overtook her at the adjoining block. We are also scared since the entire structure of the building has developed cracks,” a woman staff said.

Local leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party rushed to the spot and blamed the contractor for poor quality construction, demanding his arrest. They also demanded ₹1 crore ex-gratia to the family of the deceased, failing which an agitation would be called for.

59,2020/10/05,Awaiting the migrant,"Operations are yet to pick up in various sectors despite unlock measures due to severe shortage of workers

A few days after the clamping of nationwide lockdown on March 24, thousands of migrant workers embarked on a long trek, walking hundreds of kilometres braving the summer heat in the fond hope of reaching their native places in various States of the country. Rendered jobless, starving and staring at an uncertain future caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown, all that the desperate souls wanted at that time was to go back home and reunite with their families.

Some of them reportedly dropped dead in their tracks, though there are no official figures, due to dehydration and starvation while others survived the arduous journey with the help of food and other assistance provided by NGOs and the kind-hearted people of the places they had passed through. Groups of people carrying children and luggage on their backs was a common sight on highways.

Later on, the Central government helped transport thousands of workers back to their home States by Shramik trains.

Not ready to come back yet

Now, after a few months, economic activity is slowly picking up as people of the State are learning to live with coronavirus by taking necessary precautions, but many of the workers seem not willing to come back as COVID-19 infection continues to spread in A.P. On the other hand, they are facing the same transportation problem again. And walking back probably is not an option for them now with the virus widespread in the country.

This has led to a severe shortage of workers and operations in various sectors like agriculture, aquaculture and construction are hit.

According to an estimate, more than two lakh workers from Odisha, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Telangana and other States used to work in Andhra Pradesh.

Badly hit

Many workers from Odisha and West Bengal used work at aqua ponds, cold storage plants, and in shrimp and fish processing and packing units.

""Due to shortage of labour we could not harvest the crop on time and suffered huge losses,"" laments a shrimp farmer K. Venkateswara Rao of East Godavari district.

Agriculture and horticulture sectors are among the worst-hit due to shortage of labour during the ongoing kharif and many agriculturists had to take up operations like sowing and weed removal themselves in West Godavari, Krishna, East Godavari and other districts.

""Hundreds of workers used to come from the border districts in Telangana to pluck jasmine buds in our gardens. But this year the pandemic has kept them away and crops worth crores of rupees have been lost,"" bemoans a farmer Ramakrishna.

Changing trend

However, there seems to be an increasing trend of workers coming back in buses and trains by following COVID-19 safety protocols, albeit in small numbers.

""Andhra Pradesh is blessed with good natural resources and we can get work throughout the year here. We are about 25 families working in the construction field for the past 10 years here,"" says a woman worker Kamala of Odisha.

At work places too, managements are arranging sanitisers and masks to prevent the spread of the disease.

Lack of welfare measures for them is another area of concern. ""A few years ago, we used to inspect the sites and collect the particulars of the labourers from different States working there as per Inter-State Migrant Workers Act, 1979. But after the introduction of Ease of Doing Business (EoDB), there is no need to obtain permissions for engaging workers from other States, and we don’t have any right to insist on maintaining such records,"" says an officer, indicating the difficulties in bringing them under the goverment welfare schemes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/awaiting-the-migrant/article32768490.ece
60,2020/10/05,Pharma units see healthy staff turnout,"Improved transport puts companies on road to early recovery

The pharmaceutical units in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts are among the industries that have resumed their operations quite early after the relaxation of lockdown norms. The staff turnout which fell below 50% in many companies between April and June due to coronavirus fear has picked up in the last few weeks.

Around 1,700 workers of Pydibhimavaram-

Pusapati Rega industrial zones were affected by COVID-19 but a majority of them have recovered from it and almost all of them have been reporting for duty.

The transport curbs during lockdown have affected production in many companies between March last week and July first week but Unlock-3 and 4 guidelines helped them operate vehicles from nearby districts for staff as usual.

""Many employees depend on RTC buses to reach industries. Following transport ban they stopped coming for work. Now, the situation has improved significantly with the plying of RTC buses and private vehicles,"" says an official of a pharmaceutical company in Pusapati Rega.

Safety measures

The units are taking care to prevent the spread of coronavirus among the staff. Aurobindo Pharma, Dr.Reddy’s Laboratory, Andhra Organics and other companies have established ‘disinfection tunnels’. Special teams have been formed to prevent unwanted gatherings within the premises and masks and sanitisers are being supplied regularly.

""We are operating additional buses for staff since some 50% seats are left vacant in the vehicles as per COVID-19 protocol. Thermal scanning, tele-medicine service and other facilities have been provided in our Pydibhimavaram unit,"" explains N.R. Raja Reddy of Aurobindo Pharma.

On the other hand, trade unions have urged the government to ensure paid leave for the employees infected by coronavirus. ""Only a few companies are paying wages for the leave period,"" complains CITU State vice-president D. Govinda Rao.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pharma-units-see-healthy-staff-turnout/article32768476.ece
61,2020/10/05,Hospitality sector opens arms for its old hands,"Barely 30% of workers from other states have returned, say restaurateurs

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit every sector and uncertainty still dogs the revival of some of them which are mainly dependent on migrant labour force.

In Visakhapatnam two sectors — construction and hospitality — are heavily dependent on migrant work force. It is estimated that there are over 50,000 people from other States such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal working in the hospitality sector here. Immediately after Lockdown-1 when the Union government resumed partial operation of trains and buses, over 45,000 migrant workers left the city for their native places and many are yet to return.

According to Mr. Seshagiri Mantri, who owns a chain of restaurants in the city, the migrants comprise about 70% of the workforce in the sector and barely about 30% have returned so far.

The restaurant business opened up about two weeks ago but the sales are yet to pick up as still not many people are willing to eat out. The hotels are also waiting for the labour force to return to start their operations at full scale, he says.

Transportation issues

With train and bus services not fully operational yet, lack of transportation is one main thing that is still keeping the labour force away. ""We have just one or two trains coming to Visakhapatnam from Kolkata and no bus service. We are returning in phases and in the next couple of months all of us will be back. Without work and pay we have been through a rough patch in the past six months and want to join back duty as early as possible,"" narrates Santosh Yadav, who works as a cook in a restaurant here.

""Many workers are taking the trains wherever they are available and for others we are trying to arrange some transport to bring them back,"" explains Mr. Seshagiri.

Not much impact

For the construction sector in Visakhapatnam, things are not that bad as most of the labour force is from Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts.

In other sectors such as IT and pharma, the percentage of migrant force is minimal or they are from neighbouring districts. And many of them have stayed back.

It is estimated that it may take at least a couple of months for the workers to come back in full strength.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hospitality-sector-opens-arms-for-its-old-hands/article32768473.ece
62,2020/10/05,Absence of skilled force being felt,"Industrial tasks needing specific skills remain pending in Sri City

As more than 50% of the skilled construction workers from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal who returned home due to the pandemic situation are yet to return to Chittoor district, construction activity continues to remain paralysed, particularly the work in some industries and big ventures that requires certain specialised skills.

In Sri City about 2,000 workers from northern States used to be engaged in regular construction activity.

Work resumed in the industrial belt after a hiatus of three months, but the absence of the northern workforce is ‘very glaring’, admits a contractor executing work for a major company in Sri City.

""Regular construction activity could be handled by the local workforce but the skilled workforce from northern States is required for executing some specific industrial tasks. Not even half of them have returned so far,"" says Public Relations Officer (Sri City) Ravindranath Chivukula.

A couple of months ago, building works related to foundation, ceiling and pillars resumed, but the finishing works such as granite polishing and interior designing remain suspended in Tirupati, Chittoor, Srikalahasti, Madanapalle and other parts of the district, says Srinivasulu Reddy, a contractor in Tirupati. A majority of the contractors prefer workers from the north considering their flexible approach in collecting wages compared to their local counterparts, he admits.

Other major areas where migrant workers are required are mango gardens and pulp industries. ""Exactly when the mango season commenced in April, the migrant workers had left for their native places, jeopardising the interests of seasonal traders and pulp units. However, their numbers were promptly replaced by the local force,"" explains Deputy Director (Horticulture) B. Venkateswarulu.

Meanwhile, a good number of skilled artisans from Rajasthan who work on porcelain and ethnic art of various sorts meant for interior decoration have started returning to Chittoor in small numbers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/absence-of-skilled-force-being-felt/article32768450.ece
63,2020/10/05,Villagers demand lighting at accident-prone zones,"Traffic came to a grinding halt at Sankranthipalle village of Bangarupalem mandal on the Chittoor-Bengaluru national highway on Sunday morning, after a group of villagers staged a road blockade protesting against the death of an elderly man in a road mishap in the early hours of Sunday.

According to the police, an elderly couple was returning home from a relative’s house on their two-wheeler early Sunday morning when an auto-rikshaw hit them at a sharp curve. The couple was rushed to the government hospital in Chittoor where the 70-year old man succumbed to his injuries. His wife, who also suffered grievous injuries, was said to be out of danger.

Reacting to the accident, villagers of Sankranthipalle gathered at the accident spot demanding better lighting at the accident-prone zone.

Puthalapattu MLA M.S. Babu rushed to the spot and pacified the angry villagers, assuring them that he would take up the issue with the district administration and authorities of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and initiate steps for illuminating the accident-prone zone.

The villagers informed the MLA that after dusk, it is highly risky for the people of various villages along the highway as there are neither any signboards for motorists nor proper lighting at accident-prone zones.

As many as 8,000 employees and workers have lost their jobs after several industries, hatcheries and mining units in Vizianagaram district were forced to down their shutters due to the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) said on Sunday.

A roundtable conference was organised in Vizianagaram on Sunday to seek the government’s support for employees and labourers who lost their livelihood.

CITU general secretary of Vizianagaram district T.V. Ramana said that week-long agitations have been planned in the district. “We will meet Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana on October 10 as part of the Samuhika Rayabaram, a collective consultation programme,” said Mr. Ramana.

A. Gowri Naidu, a trade union leader from Garividi, said that the mining industry had stopped its activity completely, leading to denial of livelihood to thousands of people living in Cheepurupalli, Garividi, Gurla and other places. “With huge losses, hatcheries have shut shop. They did not receive any financial support from the government. It had a cascading affect on labourers depending on those units,” said B. Suryanarayana.

67,2020/10/05,JD(S) leaders hit out at Siddaramaiah,"Janata Dal (Secular) leaders have come down heavily on former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for his comments on the JD(S) and its leader H.D. Kumaraswamy. Former Minister H.D. Revanna and party State president H.K. Kumaraswamy have criticised the Congress leader and said it was the Congress which sought the JD(S) support to form the coalition government in Karnataka.

Mr. Revanna, at a press conference in Hassan on Monday, said the people of the State would teach a lesson to the Congress for the comments made by the former Chief Minister. “Both the national parties are afraid of the JD(S). The whole State knows who asked H.D. Kumaraswamy to accept the Chief Minister’s post. We never went to their doorsteps seeking an opportunity to form the government.”

Reacting to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s comments on Mr. Kumaraswamy, Mr. Revanna said, “Mr. Kumaraswamy weeps when he meets poor people. Our national president Deve Gowda also responds emotionally whenever he is upset with the way the developments are happening all around. Ours is a party with poor people of the land”, he said.

Regarding the CBI raids on KPCC president D.K .Shivakumar, Mr. Revanna said during the Lok Sabha polls, the raids were conducted on leaders of the JD(S) and the Congress. “The raids were all politically motivated. I appeal to the Prime Minister to conduct raids on all leaders, irrespective of the party they belong to”, he said.

Earlier in the day Mr. H.K.Kumaraswamy, in a separate press conference, said “Mr. Siddaramaiah should stop making such allegations against the JD(S). Though Mr. Kumaraswamy was the Chief Minister, it was the Congress which ruled the State. We were never sat on their shoulder to rule the State. They took the support of our shoulder to rule.”

Referring to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s comments on Mr. H.D. Kumaraswamy’s tearful, emotional speeches, the party president said, “Our leader is a kind-hearted man. He responds to problems of poor people emotionally. But, Mr. Siddaramaiah does not understand the feelings of the poor”.

The JD(S) leader exuded confidence that his party would win the by-polls.

Once a model for COVID-19 management in the State, it is now registering a mortality rate of 1.9 per cent whereas the national mortality rate is at 1.6 per cent, State at 1.5 per cent and 3.5 percent globally, he said, adding that the tests are not meeting the target and 65 per cent tests are not satisfactory.

He said the treatment for home-isolated patients was not being recorded properly and the health authorities must update information on such patients without showing any negligence. “It is appalling that there were 11 deaths in one household here. We should rectify past mistakes and utilise telemedicine facilities better.”

69,2020/10/05,"CBI raids properties linked to D.K. Shivakumar, his brother","₹57 lakh in cash recovered; disproportionate assets case registered

In fresh trouble for Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a disproportionate assets (DA) case against him and conducted simultaneous raids on 14 premises linked to him and his brother D.K. Suresh, Bengaluru Rural MP, on Monday. Raids were conducted on nine premises in the State, four in Delhi, and one in Mumbai.

In a statement, the CBI said the case pertains to “allegations of possession of DA to the tune of ₹74.93 crore in his name and in the name of his family members”. Searches have led to the recovery of cash of approximately ₹57 lakh and several incriminating documents, the CBI said. However, Mr. Shivakumar said the CBI had only found ₹1.77 lakh from his house and he was not answerable to recoveries made elsewhere.

Emerging out after a 11-hour-long raid on his residence, Mr. Shivakumar termed it “political vendetta” in the run-up to the bypolls. “I’m not the one to be terrified of these tactics, or bow down to pressure. Let us work hard for the bypolls and give a fitting reply to the Bharatiya Janata Party,” he told party workers outside his house.

I-T raids in 2017

Trouble for Mr. Shivakumar began with the Income Tax raids in August 2017, when he was herding Gujarat Congress MLAs in the run-up to a Rajya Sabha election in that State. Recoveries made during the searches — ₹8.59 crore unaccounted cash — at his Delhi residence led to a money laundering probe by the Enforcement Directorate, in which he spent over 50 days in custody in 2019. The ED that had uncovered more suspect transactions and assets had written to the CBI recommending a probe under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. On the request of the CBI, the Government of Karnataka had given its consent for a CBI probe on September 25, 2019. “The CBI had taken up a preliminary inquiry in March 2020 and filed a DA case on October 3, and conducted raids on Monday,” CBI sources said.

Several Congress leaders alleged political vendetta and misuse of agencies by the BJP “in another attempt to derail the party’s preparation for the bypolls”, as Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah put it. Sporadic protests were reported across the State, including in front of Mr. Shivakumar’s residence. Congress workers even tried to gherao CBI officials’ car as they left his residence.

However, the BJP was quick to distance itself from the raids. BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel said the CBI action was only a natural outcome of investigations against Mr. Shivakumar since 2017 and the party did not have anything to do with it. He condemned the Congress protests against CBI action. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has curiously remained silent on the issue.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3uhmoo/article32776722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGSHIVAKUMARPAGE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cbi-raids-properties-linked-to-dk-shivakumar-his-brother/article32776723.ece
70,2020/10/05,Proud moment for KSOU as 19 alumni selected probationary officers,"They had cleared the Karnataka Administrative Services examination in 2015

The recent selection of 19 of its alumni as gazetted probationary officers, after clearing the Karnataka Administrative Services exam in 2015, has made the Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) launch a campaign for propagating its open distance learning (ODL), especially in rural areas.

KSOU has set a vision to give benefits of ODL to help candidates who could not pursue their education in universities for various reasons.

After being derecognised in 2015 by the University Grants Commission and getting it back after over three years, KSOU is making a bid to regain the confidence of people by introducing several reforms, including online education and online admissions.

“It’s a moment of pride for us that our alumni have cleared the KPSC examination and got selected as probationary officers. This has proved that degrees from KSOU can compare to those from conventional universities,” said Vice-Chancellor S. Vidyashankar.

He told The Hindu that KSOU has decided to promote the KAS achievers as “ambassadors” for the varsity, to highlight the importance of distance learning for making a bright career, using its network in every district.

Boosting image

As many as 16,000 posters, with the details of 19 officers, have been printed and are being circulated among its regional centres and study centres for boosting the varsity’s image.

“The message is clear that ODL students are also equally competent. Our alumni have proved it. Such candidates should be an inspiration for others. We provide opportunities to excel and a centre for training the candidates in competitive examinations is already functioning,” Prof. Vidyashankar said.

The V-C said he personally spoke to every KAS achiever. “The posters will be put up mostly in villages and remote areas where opportunities are scarce and where the KSOU would like to fill the gap,” said Prof. Vidyashankar.

The current admissions are on and the KSOU management is hoping for more admissions to various courses this year.

Rudresha B.R., an ex-serviceman, who has been appointed as the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Tax (Group A), said he got the degree from KSOU in 2012, while he was serving the Army. “The ODL helped me get a graduate and a postgraduate degree. Because of this, I could crack the KAS exam. It would have been difficult to get a degree from a conventional university since I was already employed. Distance education gave me the accessibility and I thank KSOU for this.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1hdxvj/article32776715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BGKSOU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/proud-moment-for-ksou-as-19-alumni-selected-probationary-officers/article32776716.ece

72,2020/10/05,High Court poser to civic body on public toilets in Bengaluru,"BBMP asked if it had undertaken exercise to determine number of toilets needed

The High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike to inform whether any exercise had been undertaken to know how many privies (public toilets) had to be set up in Bengaluru city.

The court also directed the BBMP to inform whether any exercise had been carried out to know the number of toilets required for women, and steps taken to keep all public toilets clean and safe for use.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order on a PIL petition filed by city-based Letzkit Foundation.

The petitioner organisation complained about the failure of the BBMP in setting up the required number of public toilets and maintaining the existing toilets in a clean and proper manner as per Section 245 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act.

Meanwhile, the court directed the BBMP on what action it had taken under Section 248 and 249 of the KMC Act, which empowers the Commissioner to ensure providing sufficient toilets at workplaces having more than 20 labourers and at markets, cart stands, cattle stand, choultry, theatres, railway stations or other place of public resort.

ULBs across State

Observing that the issues raised in the petition were of public importance, the Bench noted that these issued required to be addressed not only by the BBMP but other urban local bodies (ULBs) in the State. The Bench directed the State government to issue necessary circulars to all ULBs on the issues raised in the petition.

Swachh Bharat Mission

The petitioner pointed out that as per the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) guidelines, there needed to be one water closet for every 100 males up to 400 persons; and two water closets for every 100 females up to 200 persons to cater to the floating population. Also, one urinal was required to be set up for every 50 male as per SBM, apart from providing one ablution tap for every water closet.

It was pointed out in the petition that Bengaluru city has only 473 public toilet complexes with 2,838 toilets, which was not even 50% of what that prescribed in the SBM.

Also, the petitioner said that migrants, labourers and other persons belonging to weaker sections, particularly women, would not be able to use many toilet/urinal complexes across the city as they collect ₹5 for use of toilets by men or women, and ₹1 for urinals for men.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/au3fq9/article32778673.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/high-court-poser-to-civic-body-on-public-toilets-in-bengaluru/article32776698.ece

75,2020/10/05,No reason for BJP to target DKS ahead of bypolls: Sudhakar,"Denying the Congress party’s charges that the ruling BJP was targeting Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief D.K. Shivakumar ahead of the bypolls to Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Sira Assembly segments in the State, Minister for Medical Education K Sudhakar said the fate of the BJP government in the State does not depend on the outcome of the byelections.

“The BJP has 117 seats of its own (in a house of 224). Hypothetically speaking, even if the BJP loses both the bypolls, what can happen to the BJP government in the State? These two seats will not decide the fate of the government”, Mr. Sudhakar said, seeking to counter the Congress party’s argument.

Also, Mr. Sudhakar said there was no truth in the Congress’s allegation that the raids against Mr. Shivakumar were politically motivated. “Why should it be politically motivated? Is Mr. Shivakumar the only leader in Congress. Isn’t Mr. Siddaramaiah there (in the party)? He was the Chief Minister for five years. Isn’t he a bigger mass leader than Mr. Shivakumar? Why are there no raids against him?”, Mr. Sudhakar questioned.

Contending that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Income Tax, Enforcement Directorate (ED) were all independent agencies, the Minister said there is no reason to suspect that the raids were due to political interference in their functioning.

He said the raids could be part of the ongoing probe against Mr. Shivakumar and added that it was an occasion for the Congress leader to come clean. “He has been claiming that he is not corrupt. It is an opportunity for him to prove his honesty”, he said. A clear picture will emerge after the probe concludes, Mr. Sudhakar said.

The Minister also recalled how Home Minister Amit Shah had been banished from Gujarat for two years when the Congress was in power at the Centre. Similiarly, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy too had been imprisoned for two years when the Congress was in power. “Can we say that there was political motivation behind this?”, he said while emphasising the need to respect the independence of these investigating agencies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/no-reason-for-bjp-to-target-dks-ahead-of-bypolls-sudhakar/article32776674.ece

Asked about large sections of teachers remaining outside the electoral rolls, Mr. Prasad said that consistent persuasion had resulted in the addition of over 6,000 voters in the electoral rolls.

“We have been continuously persuading teachers to add their names in the electoral rolls. Despite the best efforts from our staff, many eligible teachers have not applied for inclusion of their names in the electoral rolls.

Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala Dharmadhikari and Chancellor of Sri Dharmasthala Manjunatheshwara University D. Veerendra Heggade has emphasised the need for ensuring advanced yet affordable healthcare facilities for people.

Addressing the faculty members and doctors of SDM Dental College and Hospital through a video link during the 34th anniversary celebrations of the institution in Dharwad recently, Mr. Heggade also emphasised the need for making continuous efforts to provide quality healthcare facilities for the public.

Expressing happiness over Sri Dharmasthala Manjunatheshwara University being recognised as an “Emerging University” in the recent all India survey conducted by Outlook India magazine, Mr. Heggade said that success did not come overnight but it was the result of continuous and persistent efforts. He asked the faculty members and students to continue making further improvements and upgrade their skills in tune with the advancements in the field of dental sciences.

Vice-Chancellor of the university Niranjan Kumar, Pro Vice-Chancellor Jeevandhar Kumar and principal of the college Balaram Naik and heads of various departments of dental sciences were present during the virtual address.

SDM Dental College and Hospital, which started functioning from the campus of SDM College of Engineering and Technology in Dharwad in September 1986, moved to its own campus of 27 acres at Sattur on the outskirts of Dharwad after four years.

81,2020/10/05,Minister suggests controlled Dasara fete over COVID-19 spike,"Spurt in cases in Kerala after restrictions lifted over Onam festival should serve as warning: Sudhakar

Minister for Medical Education K. Sudhakar on Monday said the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in Kerala during Onam festival resulted in a surge of cases and such inaccuracies should not happen when Mysuru celebrates Dasara.

As many as 7,000 to 8,000 COVID-19 cases are now being reported in the neighbouring State after the restrictions were relaxed for the festival. Therefore the Dasara festivities should be kept as simple as possible over the pandemic scare. A final call on making celebrations safe will be taken after consultations with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar and Minister for Health B. Sriramulu, he added.

“A simple and meaningful Dasara is our aim,” he said, after chairing a meeting here to review the COVID-19 situation as Mysuru reported a spike in cases over the last few days.

He said COVID-19 is now getting out of control in Mysuru which was earlier a model for the State with no casualties reported despite many cases. “I am therefore here to take stock of the situation and give instructions for controlling it effectively,” he said, adding that Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, who assumed charge recently, has sought a two-week time to control the pandemic and show results.

Mr. Sudhakar said the State was not facing shortage of ventilators but shortage of beds with oxygen supply. Therefore, steps had been taken to arrange 33,000 beds with oxygen supply and instructions had been given to the health officials for conducting COVID-19 testing to all senior citizens across Mysuru district.

‘Fine justified’

Justifying the decision of collecting fines of ₹500 and ₹1,000 respectively from those not wearing masks, he said the decision had become inevitable since people neglected the precautions even after various awareness activities were conducted for more than six months. “We must ensure that people strictly adhere to the guidelines.”

At the meeting, the Minister told the officials that the situation should be handled properly during Dasara festivities and the government guidelines must be strictly enforced. “COVID-19 is a long battle and all of us must work carefully till we get the vaccine.”

The booth-level task force committees should be activated and the people’s participation must be encouraged. The reasons for upsurge in the infection in the district should be studied.

The Minister said the services of people’s representatives, celebrities and popular personalities should be utilised to spread awareness. Step up the tests in markets and densely populated areas besides developing strategy for handling Dasara amidst the pandemic, he told the meeting.

Drugs purchased for ILI infections must be monitored at all medicine outlets. Treating and testing senior citizens and patients suffering from other illnesses must get priority. As many as 96,000 senior citizens suffering from various ailments need to be looked at.

He said the condition at the district hospitals needs improvement as there cannot be excuses in the treatment. Private hospitals should reserve 50% beds and the allotment of beds should be transparent.

Private hospitals are to be legally dealt with if they don’t listen. The DC should hold meetings and there should not be any complaints of overcharging by hospitals. The DHO should take action in case of any such overcharging. Officials are given full powers and they should utilise them, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hmyrtj/article32776646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MYSSUDHAKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/minister-suggests-controlled-dasara-fete-over-covid-19-spike/article32774962.ece

The party leaders, including Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa, Women and Child Welfare Minister Shashikala Jolle and MLC Mahantesh Kavatagimath, who have been appointed as in-charge for North East Teachers Constituency, will be present when he files his nomination papers, he added.

Mr. Namoshi exuding the confidence of winning the election stated that in the last couple of years he had toured all the seven districts, Bidar, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Raichur, Ballari, Koppal and Harapanahali taluk in Davangere, and met 80 % of teachers/voters personally and took note of the various problems confronting them.

Though there were around 75,000 eligible teachers in the constituency, only 24,941 of them have enrolled their names as per data of January 2020. A total of 30,000 teachers are expected to get their names enrolled during the recent revision, he added.

Mr. Namoshi recalled his efforts in converting 1,757 private-unaided educational institutions in the North East Teachers Constituency into the aided category during 1991 and 1995. He said that efforts were made to regularise the services of teachers and guest lecturers. Also, lecturers in degree colleges and professional courses were helped in getting University Grants Commission and All India Council for Technical Education pay-scales.

MLA and Chairman of the Kalyana Karnataka Region Development Board Dattatreya Patil Revoor and MLC Sunil Vallyapur were present.

Mr. Namoshi has won the teachers constituency election for three times. In the 2014 Legislative Council elections, Congress candidate Sharanappa Mattur trounced the BJP’s sitting MLC [Mr. Namoshi].

Youth Congress leader Mrunal Hebbalkar and others staged the protest near the Rani Channamma Circle. They said that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government was targeting powerful leaders in the Opposition to stop them working for the Congress in the Assembly bypolls.

Earlier, KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi released a video message describing the CBI raids as politically motivated. “The BJP is doing this to disturb us. They are taking all steps to see that we are silenced and we give up the fight for the two Assembly seats,” he said.

MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar also found political motive behind these raids. She, however, felt that Mr. Shivakumar was strong enough to emerge victorious out of such conspiracies.

84,2020/10/05,"Protests staged, tyres and effigies burnt in twin cities","Terming the CBI raid on the residence and property belonging to KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar and his brother and MP D.K. Suresh as politically motivated, members of the Congress staged protests and burnt effigies in the twin cities of Hubballi-Dharwad on Monday.

Wearing black badges, the Congress members staged a demonstration in front of the statue of B.R. Ambedkar in Hubballi, led by presidents of the Hubballi-Dharwad Mahanagar Zilla and Dharwad Rural District units, Altaf Halwoor and Anil Kumar Patil, respectively, and MLA Prasad Abbayya.

The protestors raised slogans terming the raids as politically motivated as the BJP was wary of Mr. Shivakumar emerging as a strong leader against the ruling disposition. They alleged that the BJP was trying to suppress democracy in the country.

Addressing the protestors, Mr. Anil Kumar Patil said that the raids were mainly aimed at blaming the Congress for corruption ahead of the byelections in the country. He said that the BJP was misusing the Enforcement Directorate, the CBI and other government agencies to suppress voices against the ruling disposition.

However, Mr. Shivakumar would emerge as a strong leader and would face all the allegations and come clean out of them, he said.

The protestors subsequently burnt old tyres to register their protest against the CBI raids.

Congress leaders F.H. Jakkappanavar, Basavaraj Malakari, Shakir Sanadi, Rajat Ullagaddimath, Kiran Moogbasava and others were present.

In Dharwad, the protestors, led by KPCC member Rober Daddapuri, district unit general secretary Anand Jadhav and others, staged a demonstration in front of the statue of B.R. Ambedkar condemning the raids.

The protestors alleged that as the byelections were announced in the State, the BJP-led Union government was misusing government agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI to target Congress leaders. It was highly unfortunate that a government was misusing its agencies against its political opponents for the sake of electoral gains, the protestors said.

The protestors then submitted a memorandum addressed to the President seeking his intervention to stop the misuse of government agencies for political gains. They said that the raids were being used to threaten the political leader ahead of the byelection as the ruling party had sensed that it would suffer defeat in the bypoll.

Meanwhile, KPCC Scheduled Castes Department chairman F.H. Jakkappanavar and KPCC media analyst Pandurang Neeralakeri have issued statement condemning the CBI raids. In their statement, the Congress leaders have condemned in strong terms the raids and said that the BJP government was trying to threaten the Congress leaders through such raids.

“None of the leaders are willing to solve our problems,” they told journalists.

Governor and Chancellor of universities Vajubhai Wala presented honorary doctorates to Sri Niranjana Jagadguru Rajayogindra Swami of Mooru Savir Mutt and sports administrator K. Govindaraj during the eighth convocation of Rani Channamma University in Belagavi on Monday.

The Chancellor and other guests handed over gold medals and certificates to 33 students who were present at the ceremony in the Suvarna Soudha. Another 33,000 students received their degrees in-absentia. As many as 79 Ph.Ds were awarded in various subjects.

Director of NAAC S.C. Sharma delivered his convocation lecture online during the event. He reiterated the Vedic maxim, “Knowledge is power”, and said that students should realise that their learning did not stop at passing out of the university. They should be learning new skills everyday to face the challenges of the future, he added.

“Sage Chanakya has placed education at the highest levels of a man’s achievements. He called education as the maternal trait of civilisation,’’ Dr. Sharma said.

He quoted from various scriptures to argue that nationalism and nationalistic thinking was an important factor in nation building. Young graduates are the wheels of progress. They should imbibe a sense of nationalism and emerge as future leaders, he said.

Vice-Chancellor M. Ramachandra Gowda said that the State government’s grant of 127 acres of land in Hire Bagewadi would lead to the university growing exponentially.

As many as 31,262 students have passed graduate courses with 77 getting ranks. Of these, 11 were given certificates in person. Of the 2,712 students who got post-graduate degrees, 68 have obtained ranks. Among them, 22 were invited to receive certificates from the Chancellor.

At a press conference in Shivamogga on Monday, Mr. Prasanna Kumar said “fear of defeat” in the by-elections to Sira and Rajarajeshwari Nagar constituencies made the BJP target the KPCC president. “The raids were part of the political conspiracy by the BJP. They are feared of facing the Congress led by Mr. Shivakumar in the by-elections.”

Reacting to BJP leaders’ comment that the Congress was misleading the farmers on the farm bills, Mr. Prasanna Kumar said it was unnecessary. “Not the Congress alone, the Bharatiya Kisan Manch, a supporter of the BJP, also opposed the farm bills. Are they also doing politics on the issue? The Congress had included the amendments to APMC Act in its election manifesto. But that does not mean it would have brought them if it had come to power. The BJP had promised implementation of Dr. M.S.Swaminathan’s recommendations on support price. But it has not fulfilled them yet”, he commented.

Vishwanath on Monday said the government should reconsider holding Dasara cultural events and desist from allowing even a small gathering at the palace for the scaled-down Jamboo Savari in view of rapid surge in COVID-19 cases in Mysuru.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Vishwanath said the Jamboo Savari should be organised purely as a tradition without allowing the participation of the public and the media as well as a precautionary measure.

Referring to Saturday’s cases that crossed 1,500 in Mysuru, Mr. Vishwanath said the cultural events at the palace even for a small audience could be risky since it would be difficult to restrict the public assembly, especially for the Dasara events.

The former Minister was responding to questions on the government’s plans for allowing the participation of about 2,000 persons at the palace for Jamboo Savari, which has been limited to the palace fortress. “If we allow 2,000 persons, the number will cross 10,000 with each invitee bringing two or three members along for watching the proceedings. It will be tough to restrict the public. Who is going to take the responsibility if gathering turns out bigger than expected,” he asked.

Mr .Vishwanath said Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar is new to Dasara celebrations in Mysuru and senior leaders of the district, including former Ministers and MLAs A.S. Ramdas, G.T. Deve Gowda and S.R. Mahesh, should have advised him properly and decisions are taken accordingly keeping COVID-19 in mind. “I will speak to the district Minister and also the Deputy Commissioner on this issue.”

He suggested that Jamboo Savari can be concluded after the showering of flowers on the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari seated in the golden howdah.

A beggar’s two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, who had been abducted from Nanjangud town last Thursday, has been traced in Hunasekuppe village in nearby H.D. Kote taluk.

The police arrested Gangaraju, 47, a resident of the village, for allegedly abducting the beggar Parvathi’s daughter from the pavement near Srikanteshwara Temple on October 1.

Inspector of Nanjangud Town Police Station Lakshmikanth Talwar told The Hindu that the accused had done soto satisfy his “mentally unstable” daughter’s “motherly craving” after she lost two babies.

The daughter of the accused, who had been married five years ago, had twice delivered still-born babies after caesarean operations. When she lost her second child last month, Gangaraju had set out looking for a child to meet his daughter’s yearning to have a child to look after, Mr. Talwar said.

Shivakumar and other premises linked to him on Monday morning. Raids are also on at the residence of Congress Bengaluru Rural MP and Mr. Shivakumar's brother D.K. Suresh.

In a statement released later in the day, the central agency said, ""CBI has registered a case against then Minister of Karnataka Government and others on the allegations of acquisition of Disproportionate Assets.

Mr. Shivakumar was at his Sadashivanagar residence when CBI officials knocked on his door Monday morning. Presently both Mr. Shivakumar and his brother Mr. Suresh are holed up in the house. Mr. Shivakumar's advocates who reached the residence were not allowed in to meet him.

Vindictive politics, says Congress

The raids come even as Mr. Shivakumar is leading the campaign for bypolls for two assembly seats — RR Nagar and Sira — scheduled for November 3. Leader of opposition Siddaramaiah tweeted: “BJP has always tried to indulge in vindictive politics And mislead public attention. The latest CBI raid on KPCC president D. K.

Congress national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also tweeted that ""the party workers and leaders will not be cowed down nor bow down before such devious attempts.""

However, CBI sources claimed this was only a natural course of events as Karnataka High Court had only recently upheld state government's consent to probe Mr. Shivakumar under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, that one of the accused in the case had challenged.

BJP leader and medical education minister Dr. K. Sudhakar has reacted to Congress allegations that the CBI raids are politically motivated and said CBI, ED and IT Departments are autonomous organisations and carrying out probes as per law. ""Everytime there is a raid Congress cries foul saying it is politically motivated. It is wrong to mislead people. Nobody is above law and everyone is has bow their heads before the law,"" he tweeted.

CBI case comes after I-T department and ED probes

Search and seizure operations by Income Tax Department in August 2017 had recovered ₹8.59 crore unaccounted cash from a flat in Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi.

Enforcement Directorate (ED) had registered a case for alleged money laundering and arrested Mr. Shivakumar on September 3, 2019. He was released on bail on October 24, 2019 after spending over fifty days in Tihar Jail.

The ED had written to CBI and the State government recommending for a CBI probe under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 to probe if the unaccounted cash seized was proceeds of corruption.

At the time of elections, BJP’s hollow threats will not shake us nor will we bow down to pressure tactics. We are ready to face any consequences.



We request all well wishers and party workers to remain calm. — DK Suresh (@DKSureshINC) October 5, 2020

The ED and I-T Department had also flagged other suspected transactions and benami properties that may have been a result of corruption. Based on the recommendation from ED and a request from CBI, the State government had given consent for CBI probe on September 25, 2019.

Shashi Kumar Shivanna, an employee of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, a close relative of Mr. Shivakumar, facing charges of engaging in property transactions on behalf of Mr. Shivakumar who has been facing charges of benami properties, had challenged the state government giving sanction for CBI probe.

The isolation of COVID-19 patients is traumatic not just for those afflicted by the virus, but also for family members who are unable to care for their loved ones and are dependent on the hospital authorities to keep them updated at all times. With hospitals restricting visiting hours even for non-COVID-19 patients as a precautionary measure, there have been an increasing number of complaints from people that they are being kept in the dark about the health status of their family members after hospitalisation.

In an attempt to address this, many private hospitals in Bengaluru have started making short videos of their patients, which they send to families to keep them updated on treatment plans, how the person is responding, etc.

Ravindra, Medical Director, Suguna Hospital, said that they restrict visitors as they may be at risk of catching the infection at the hospital itself. “While patients regularly video call their family members, we send videos when our doctors visit them particularly if they are in our intensive care units,” he said.

This is to avoid miscommunication during the course of the treatment. “If the family of a patient does not know what is happening, they get tense and tend to assume a lot of things regarding their loved one’s health condition. So we have decided to use this method to keep them in the loop,” he said.

Positive feedback

Anoop Amarnath of Manipal Hospitals said that the frequency of the medical team’s interaction with the families has gone up over the past two weeks. “It serves two purposes. One, it comes as a relief to families who are informed about the treatment that is being provided. It also helps our doctors get some feedback on the medical history of elderly patients,” he said, and added that the system of communication has received good feedback.

Families too are relieved with this move. “My father was admitted in the hospital and we did not visit as we were afraid of contracting the virus in the hospital. As my father is not tech-savvy we were not able to communicate properly with him. But we were relieved after the hospital started sending us videos of how he is responding to treatment,” said a software professional in Malleswaram whose father was admitted for treatment.

Hospital managements say that this system has eased the pressure on their medical staff who would otherwise be spending the better part of the day fielding calls from anxious relatives. Vikram Sreeram, MD, Mallige Hospital, said that in the recent past, different teams at the hospital were being flooded with calls from families of patients. “Families of COVID-19 patients are not allowed to visit them but non-COVID-19 patients can have one attender. We are trying to reduce the footfalls at the hospital.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/imxisd/article32769503.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGICU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/doctors-update-families-on-patients-health-via-videos/article32769504.ece
95,2020/10/05,Minto hospital to resume elective surgeries from today,"The facility began outpatient services on June 24

The State-run Minto Ophthalmic Hospital is all set to resume elective surgeries from October 5. The hospital was only conducting emergency surgeries so far. It began out-patient services on June 24.

Hospital director B.L. Sujatha Rathod told The Hindu that the plan was to start off with 15-20 surgeries per day. “Usually during the pre-COVID-19 days, we were conducting over 100 surgeries. Now, we will limit the daily number of surgeries till our staff get adjusted to operating with PPEs. Also, our staff are being trained on the additional precautions that they need to take now,” she said.

The hospital had stopped its regular functioning when Victoria Hospital was converted into a COVID-19 facility during the early days of the pandemic. Nearly 100 beds in Minto were also set aside for COVID-19 patients.

‘Patient flow is minimal’

“Although we have resumed our OPD services, the patient flow is minimal as people are generally scared to visit hospitals. Our daily patient flow of over 600 during pre-COVID-19 days has reduced to less than 100 now. Although we were open for emergency surgeries, we have not done more than six surgeries in the last month,” the director said. She said all the operation theatres in the hospital had been fumigated and tests for culture growth had been done.

“Some reports have come and they are negative. A few more are expected in a day or two. We want to ensure patients do not catch any infection within the hospital. As it is not uncommon for fungal growth to happen in any centralised air-conditioned building that has remained closed for months, we want to be doubly ensure that the operation theatres are fit for use again,” the doctor added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/minto-hospital-to-resume-elective-surgeries-from-today/article32768567.ece
96,2020/10/05,Rains disconnect this locality from the world for six months,"The locality at Halanduru has faced this problem for decades with no government agencies offering any solution

For nearly six months in a year, a locality with few houses at Halanduru in Sringeri becomes an island with no road connectivity to the rest of the world. Residents of the 20 families that live here have to cross a stream to reach the nearest habitation or walk a long distance. They have been facing this ordeal for decades with no government agencies offering any solution. They regularly face difficulty getting aged or sick people immediate healthcare.

Says Divakar, one of these residents, “Last year, my mother fell ill. It was difficult to take her to a hospital at Sringeri in a four-wheeler. We had to get the vehicle down and push it until it crossed the stretch.” Halandur is about 9 km from Sringeri taluk centre. Though there is a road to connect to Halandur village from Sringeri, there is no connectivity to a cluster of houses. In Malenadu, houses are scattered. One has to walk a long way to meet the nearest neighbour.

Venkataramu, also a resident of the locality, said, “People living elsewhere will not understand the gravity of the problem we have been facing. Outsiders might find it difficult to believe that we have had no road since the country got independence. We and our forefathers have been living in this condition since time immemorial.”.

The only way available for their movement is the path of a stream, which is full of water during the rainy season. Schoolchildren often face a tough time as they have to cross the flowing stream or take the alternative walk path to reach their destinations. “Only four-wheel drives can cross the stretch through the water. Otherwise we have to walk a couple of kms to reach the nearest alternative road to reach Sringeri. We have appealed to elected representatives and officers repeatedly. We have also offered to give a portion of our lands so that they could lay a road. But, our request has not reached them,” said Mr. Divakar. It is said that estimations were made twice to lay a separate road, but the work did not proceed further.

When The Hindu contacted Menase Gram Panchayat PDO Gopal Handa, he said there was a road to connect Halandur from Sringeri. “Recently we have taken up the improvement of other roads in the area. But, for this particular habitation, there is a problem. We cannot lay the road on the stretch where the stream flows,” he said. Further, he said a solution could be found if private people came forward to offer their land to lay a road.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rop2pi/article32768559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGSRINGERIROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rains-disconnect-this-locality-from-the-world-for-six-months/article32768560.ece
97,2020/10/05,Kottigehara residents observe bandh demanding road repairs along NH 73,"The residents of Kottigehara in Mudigere taluk on Sunday observed a bandh demanding the repair of the Charmadi Ghat stretch of National Highway 73 (Mangaluru-Villipuram) that connects Chikkamagaluru with Dakshina Kannada district. For the last two years, movement of vehicles on this stretch has been hit by repeated heavy rains and landslips.

The growers, hoteliers, businessmen of Kottigehara had called for a bandh on the day to pressurise the State government and elected representatives to repair the road. They also took out a protest march on the highway from Kottigehara. As of now, the movement of heavy vehicles has been banned on the stretch, affecting business.

Hasanabba, a hotelier at Kottigehara, said that for the last two years, the hoteliers and owners of petrol bunks and other activities had no business, as the road was closed for many months. “The road offers major connectivity for Dakshina Kannada and the rest of the State. Every day trucks carry vegetables from Chikkamagaluru to Dakshina Kannada. Besides, the people of Mudigere taluk send their children for studies to Dakshina Kannada and for healthcare, we travel to Mangaluru or Manipal via this route. Whenever the road is closed, we face hardships,” he said.

The protesters maintained that earlier too landslips had occurred on the stretch but it was restored without much delay. “Now, despite having advanced technology and heavy machinery, the National Highways wing of the Public Works Department has not been able to take up the work to strengthen the road. We, the residents of Kottigehara, demand that the government and elected representatives attend to this issue,” said Sanjay Gowda, who led the protest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/t69sqz/article32768544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGHASSANBANDHP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kottigehara-residents-observe-bandh-demanding-road-repairs-along-nh-73/article32768545.ece
98,2020/10/05,ED summons Kerala CPI(M) leader’s son in drugs case,"Bineesh Kodiyeri has been asked to appear before the agency on Oct. 6

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), probing the finances involved in a narcotics racket that was recently busted by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in the city, has summoned Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of Kerala CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan for interrogation. He has been asked to present himself before the agency in the city on October 6, Tuesday.

The NCB had busted a narcotics ring and arrested two peddlers from a flat in Kalyan Nagar on August 21 - Mohammed Anoop and R. Ravindran, both from Kerala. NCB sleuths had seized 145 Ecstasy pills from the flat. Their interrogation and follow-up action based on the leads they provided led to large seizures and arrest of another peddler Anikha. D, whose clientèle included many from the Kannada film industry.

The ED, which is looking into the finances of these peddlers and their sources for money laundering and hawala transactions, had recently conducted an audit of their finances, questioned them and recorded their statements at Parappana Agrahara Central Prison, where they are currently lodged.

“Mohammed Anoop in his statement has said Bineesh Kodiyeri had lent him ₹50 lakh. We will question him as to what are his links with a peddler, for what purpose was the money given, what was the source of this money and whether he has declared it in his financial statements,” a senior ED official said.

Gold smuggling case

The ED had earlier questioned Bineesh Kodiyeri in connection with the gold smuggling case in which gold was being smuggled through diplomatic channels at the Thiruvananthapuram airport, in Kerala on September 9.

In documents submitted to a court in Kerala, the ED has claimed there are suspicions that the accused in the drug racket busted by NCB in Bengaluru may have helped accused in the gold smuggling case in Kerala.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vccv50/article32768531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGBINEESHKODIYERIP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ed-summons-kerala-cpim-leaders-son-in-drugs-case/article32768532.ece
99,2020/10/05,Civil Services preliminary examinations held,"Many say the paper was tough

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducted the civil services preliminary examinations on Sunday with a slew of precautions in place. Many candidates who appeared for it said they found the paper tough.

“Due to the pandemic, the exams were delayed for over four months. There were many guidelines in place. I found the preliminary exam tough. The questions were tricky and analytical,” Haricharan, a candidate from Bengaluru, said.

Candidates were allowed inside the exam centres after temperature checks and hand sanitisation. However, norms of social distancing prior to entering the exam hall were not followed strictly at some centres, said several students who took the test.

Another aspirant said, “I expect the cut off will be lower this year. Questions asked from polity, environment and other subjects were analytical and required more time to answer.”

The preliminary examinations were initially scheduled to be held on May 31, but got postponed to October 4 due to the pandemic. “Unlike previous years, there was uncertainty over conducting the preliminary exams. This has also impacted our preparation,” said another candidate.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9kc350/article32768501.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGUPSC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/civil-services-preliminary-examinations-held/article32768502.ece
100,2020/10/05,Musicians too work from home in times of COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown and the changed work culture may have been painful for many, but it has turned out to be a boon for some.

Himanshu Prakash, a young music technologist from Mumbai, has shifted to his home town of Dharwad and has begun working from home. “It has been such a pleasure!” he declares as he tunes his guitar to sync it with his electronic piano and other instruments. Sitting in the second floor of his house, he fiddles on his laptop, plays on the piano, adjusts the guitar strings, and checks the ultra-sensitive microphone while humming a tune set to Hindustani music.

He has received several pieces of instrumental and vocal music sent to him online by his team members from Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi. He slits them as if they were pictures or video clips, and pastes them over each other. What comes out at the end is a complete musical number with sounds of instruments in the background and the leading voices treated and processed by software tools.

“The slow pace of this town, the nearly silent surroundings, and the near-zero visitors to our house because of the lockdown has increased my productivity. You can never get such an ambience in Mumbai,” he says. “COVID -19 has forced music technologists, otherwise bound to their high-tech studios, to work from home with minimal equipment and new-age software.”

“The whole music team meets online to discuss projects. We divide our work, as though we were employees on an assembly line. Each one does his bit like singing a song, playing an instrument, or recording such performances, as per the music director’s instructions. Then those pieces are sent to technologists like us who sew them together, enhancing or diminishing some sounds, eliminating noise, and adding echo or effects. The final product seems as if it were created in one room with all the stakeholders sitting across the same table,” he says.

Mr. Prakash is a trained music technologist and a reference music director. He is also a trained Hindustani classical musician and has worked on several film and TV projects and advertisement campaigns. He was noticed for his work as an assistant music consultant for Bandish Bandits, the hit streaming series.

He thanks his parents Sunanda and Prakash Bhat for letting him choose his calling. “They sent me on a 12-month sabbatical after my SSLC. A friend and I went around the country volunteering for NGOs and engaging in adventure sports and fun activities. The trip helped me choose music. I went to Bengaluru after my pre-university course and then to Mumbai,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/unhdrq/article32768163.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGHIMANSHUPRAKASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/musicians-too-work-from-home-in-times-of-covid-19/article32768164.ece
101,2020/10/05,Handlooms across Karnataka are now weaving a sad tale,"Stocks have piled up and with no work forthcoming weavers are migrating

For more than a month now, 20 handlooms of Yellanna Ganti, at Kerur in Badami taluk, have fallen silent and the skilled weavers working on them have lost their livelihood.

Mr. Ganti’s Banashankari Handloom Production Unit has piled up a stock of 6,000 metres of fabric as it has reported very poor sales in the post-lockdown months.

Mr. Ganti, who produced an average of 3,000 metres of handloom a month before the lockdown, has stopped production and is now focused on clearing his stock to generate capital to restart his unit.

‘Out of work’

“I feel very bad as weavers have been out of work for more than a month now. I have stocks but no cash to pay weavers. Only if I clear the stock can I get money to restart the looms,” Mr. Ganti told The Hindu over phone.

“The younger generation of weavers has left and those who are still in villages are those who cannot migrate. My biggest worry now is how to provide them work,” he said.

Similar stories echo from different weaving clusters in Bagalkot, Gadag, and Yadgir districts which have a high number of weavers. Already, the weaving community has shrunk significantly as per the 4th Handloom Census 2018-2019, conducted by Union Ministry of Textiles, and the COVID-19 crisis is another blow.

Mudhol-based Dhaneshwari Kaimagga Nekarara Batte Utpadakara Ghataka, a self-help group (SHG) in Bagalkot, has unsold stock of 5,000 metres, while the monthly production has come down from an average 5,000 metres to about 2,000 metres. “We never faced a situation like this. We have tried different products too but they have not yet received market acceptance,” said Shivashankar E. Moodalagi of the ghataka.

Shivamogga-based Charaka Women Weavers’ Cooperative has a stock pile of nearly 80,000 metres.

A serious consequence of the current situation has been that weavers, not finding work in their villages, have started migrating in search of jobs.

“If we stop weaving completely, weavers will go away. Many other jobs yield better wages and are less strenuous. We are struggling to give them work,” said Mallikarjun Rawat of Shahpur-based Shambhavi Kaimagga Nekarara Sangh in Yadgir district.

“Of the 50 weavers we had, 20 have left. We will have to run around to get weavers if all of them leave,” he added.

Cancelled orders

Gajendragad-based Sri Banashankari Nekarara Sahakara Sangh has not only seen high stocks, but also cancellation of existing orders, resulting in finances going haywire.

“Despite the crisis, we continue to give some work because if we let the weavers go, we have to shut the looms permanently. We have to show interest in retaining the talent. As it is, the younger generation is not interested in weaving,” said sangh secretary Ambareesh R.S. “In fact, due to capital crisis, many societies are near closure. After the current crisis, the number of active weavers may come down further.”

Of the 50 weavers attached to the Dhaneshwari Kaimagga in Mahalingapur, at least 15 are expected not to return.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ab2za6/article32768113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5BGWEAVEADA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/handlooms-across-karnataka-are-now-weaving-a-sad-tale/article32768115.ece
102,2020/10/05,Lyricist Kalyan blames ‘astrologer’ for turmoil in his family,"Kannada film lyricist K. Kalyan has alleged that an “astrologer” had abducted his wife and parents-in-law.

He said at a press conference here on Sunday that he had filed a police complaint against Shivanand Wali, a self-proclaimed astrologer from Bilagi in Bagalkot district, currently living in Belagavi. Mr. Kalyan, in the complaint, said that Mr. Wali had abducted his wife, Ashwini, and her parents, Radhika and Krishna Satvik.

It was alleged in the complaint, filed on Saturday, that Mr. Wali had hypnotised the trio and forced Mr. Krishna to transfer ₹19.8 lakh to his bank account. The “astrologer” had also forced Mr. Krishna to transfer his property to him, Mr. Kalyan said.

Under the influence of the “astrologer”, the Satviks and their daughter had left Bengaluru and were living in Belagavi, the lyricist alleged. The Satviks, who hail from Belagavi, had shifted to Mr. Kalyan’s residence last year.

Mr. Kalyan charged that Ganga Kulkarni, a cook in his house in Bengaluru, had sowed the seeds of discord in his family. The cook and the “astrologer” allagedly influenced Ms. Ashwini, resulting in her treating Mr. Kalyan as a stranger.

He, however, said that he loved his wife and was hopeful of a reconciliation. “I am sure her behaviour will change if she is counselled. I am confident of regaining her affection. I will write a love song for her and and make her sing it,” he said.

Investigating officers, meanwhile, said Ms. Ashwini had contradicted Mr. Kalyan’s claims. She met inspector B.R. Gaddekar of Mala Maruti police station and told him that the couple were facing problems in their marriage. She also dismissed the charge of abduction, the police said.

She alleged that her husband had subjected her to mental agony and was not carrying out some marital responsibilities. The couple are fighting a divorce case in the family court in Belagavi.

Following Mr. Kalyan’s complaint, Mr. Wali was arrested. Police Commissioner K. Thiyagarajan said the city police were focusing on the financial transactions and property transfer. “Our officers are trying to find out if it was done under duress or if it was a case of fraud, as has been alleged,” he said. He added that the police would not interfere if the case was of civil nature.

He said the women’s helpline in the commissionerate had referred Ms. Ashwini to counsellor Sandeep Patil.

Family meetings

Meanwhile, family members of Mr. Kalyan on Sunday held a series of meetings to resolve the problem between the lyricist and his spouse.

103,2020/10/05,"One year on, this family is still in a relief camp","Providing alternative facility delayed

It has been more than a year since a family of Chickpet near Hosanagar moved to a relief centre after their house collapsed during heavy rains in August 2019.

Even as the locality was battered by another spell of heavy rains this year, the family continues to remain in the relief centre, thanks to a delay in providing them with an alternative facility.

The four families settled at Chickpet were badly hit during the heavy rains last year. The residents are daily wage workers with no land to cultivate.

A house collapsed completely, while three other houses developed cracks, forcing them to move out. The local administration set up a relief centre at a government quarter meant for Health Department staff, which was unoccupied, for them.

A couple of days later, when the rains receded, three families, headed by Suresh, Udaya and Subramanya, returned to their places, while Sumitra Bangari’s family remained at the centre as their house had collapsed completely. Many officers, elected representatives visited the place and promised the affected families of relief. As none of the four families had the land of their own, they could not get the relief amount meant for repair or construction of a house.

The recent rains also battered the village again. Ms. Bangari, who stays with her two children in the relief centre, said she had appealed to local panchayat officials and Revenue Department repeatedly for a solution to the problem.

“Whenever we raise our demand, the officers ask us to remain in the relief centre until an alternative arrangement is made. How long should we continue to stay there?” she questioned.

All four families have appealed to the district administration to provide them with permanent relief.

Shivamogga Deputy Commissioner K.B. Shivakumar visited the village recently and spoke to the affected people.

He said that efforts were being made to identify three acres of land for Ashraya sites in the village.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/one-year-on-this-family-is-still-in-a-relief-camp/article32768076.ece
104,2020/10/05,Better surveillance brings to light more poaching cases,"Five such cases were detected on M.M. Hills in September alone

Increase in surveillance and monitoring has led to a surge in the detection of poaching cases in M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in recent months.

As many as five cases have been detected during September alone, including one of the biggest racket involving trading in wildlife derivatives that has led to the arrest of seven persons so far.

Recently, another poacher was nabbed in the Hanur buffer zone and 20 kg of deer meat was seized. The accused, Muruge Gowda of Kanchalli village in Hanur taluk, Chamarajanagar district, was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody. A search is on for four of his accomplices in crime.

Villages abutting the M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary and the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary have a history of poaching for meat.

Local residents had a free run during the heyday of brigand Veerappan when the area was out of bounds for the Forest Department.

But recently, the wildlife wing and the territorial divisions have reclaimed the administrative writ and have clamped down on poaching. Wildlife activists aver that such crackdown will act as a deterrent and these numbers will decline gradually.

“This is a social issue and cannot be resolved overnight but villagers are now aware that killing wildlife for meat is illegal and can land them in prison. Yet, there are individuals who are unable to resist it and this is being addressed through increase in surveillance,” said V. Yedukondalu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary.

The local intelligence gathering mechanism has also been strengthened and now the authorities have information about individuals with weapons. “We have a list of individuals who own country-made weapons and will ask them to surrender it,” said Mr.Yadukondalu.

Though there were similar efforts in the past, the department would fall short in collecting evidence admissible in court and the poachers would go free.

“But now we have invited legal experts to train our staff for drafting the case and also collect and present evidence which will increase the conviction rate in the future,” the official said.

There are proposals to increase anti-poaching camps in the M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary, whose notification and upgrade as a tiger reserve is a matter of formality.

M.M. Hills is contiguous to the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary and the BRT Tiger Reserve and is a biodiversity hotspot.

Forest protection is the key to ensuring an increase in the number of carnivores like tigers.

“We have 40 anti-poaching camps [each manned by five persons] at present and it is proposed to increase it to at least 50,” said Mr. Yedukondalu.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/better-surveillance-brings-to-light-more-poaching-cases/article32768043.ece
105,2020/10/05,Karnataka bypolls: Parties in final stage of selection of candidates,"D.K. Ravi’s wife front runner for Congress ticket

Amid speculation over H. Kusuma, wife of the deceased IAS officer D.K. Ravi, trying her luck with Congress ticket to contest from Rajarajeshwari Nagar, the party high command is set to decide on the candidates for the two Assembly constituencies going into bypolls.

“We have had several rounds on discussions on who the party’s candidates should be in the two Assembly constituencies. We are sending the list of probable candidates to the high command today. The national leaders will decide,” Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar said on Sunday, as Ms. Kusuma and several local leaders from Sira constituency joined the Congress.

Ms. Kusuma is the daughter of Janata Dal (S) leader Hanumantharayappa, who also joined the Congress on Sunday, and is learnt to be keen on contesting from R.R. Nagar, which has a sizeable number of Vokkaliga voters.

The Congress State unit has backed six-time legislator and former Minister T.B. Jayachandra to contest for the Sira seat, which has now fallen vacant following the death of JD(S) legislator B. Satyanarayana. Party sources said that while only Mr. Jayachandra’s name has been sent for Sira, three names, including that of Ms. Kusuma, has been proposed for R.R. Nagar. The other two potential candidates are former legislator from Magadi Balakrishna and Raksha Ramaiah. “Ms. Kusuma is most likely to get ticket,” a source said.

“The entire State is waiting for the decision of the Sira voters,” Mr. Shivakumar remarked, adding that the Congress leadership was fully behind Mr. Jayachandra.

The Congress on Sunday distributed B-forms to its nominees in the Legislative Council elections. Mr. Shivakumar distributed the forms to R.M. Kuberappa (West Graduates), sitting member Sharanappa Mattur (North East Teachers), and Praveen Peter (Bengaluru Teachers).

Is R.R. Nagar proving tricky for BJP?

The Bharatiya Janata Party’s choice of candidate for Rajarajeshwari Nagar Assembly constituency has kept everyone guessing even as the party is expected to announce its candidates for the two constituencies going to bypolls either on Monday or Tuesday.

While it is speculated that Rajesh Gowda, son of former Congress MP Mudalagiriyappa, could finally bag the party’s ticket for Sira, it is the choice of candidate for R.R. Nagar that has kept everyone on tenterhooks. The R.R. Nagar byelection has been necessitated by the resignation of Congress legislator Munirathna, who was among the 17 Congress and JD(S) legislators to resign and cause the fall of the previous Congress-JD(S) coalition. There is quite a bit of resistance within the party to giving Mr. Munirathna the ticket, party sources said.

Sources said that the choice of candidate had become tricky because of the feud between Mr. Munirathna and Tulsi Muniraju Gowda, who could end up playing against each to ensure the other’s defeat, potentially costing the party the seat.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, Tourism Minister C.T. Ravi said that there was no confusion in the party over the choice of candidate, but acknowledged that there were many aspirants for the ticket. “No State leader, including the Chief Minister, has announced the name of the candidates so far. The BJP is stronger in R.R. Nagar. Even when D.K. Suresh was candidate, the BJP got more votes. We will win both constituencies,” he said, adding that he did not wish to comment on the possible candidature of H. Kusuma, wife of the deceased IAS officer D.K. Ravi.

A problem of plenty for JD(S) in Sira

The Janata Dal (Secular) is under pressure to retain the Sira Assembly seat after its legislator B. Satyanarayana passed away recently, but the party is faced with a problem of plenty with several candidates wishing to contest. This has delayed the selection of a candidate. The former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had, last Thursday, announced that the party would declare its candidates for the two Assembly segments which are set to see byelections.

While the JD(S) is keen to give ticket to the widow of the deceased, the late legislator’s son Satyaprakash is learnt to be keen to contest. Before the election was declared, the JD(S) had said that the first priority in ticket distribution was to the family of the late Satyanarayana. However, when Mr. Kumaraswamy spoke at a public rally a day after the election schedule was announced, he was non-committal to the family.

However, on Sunday, Tumakuru Rural legislator D.C. Gowrishankar is learnt to have met the party supremo H.D. Deve Gowda to request ticket for his brother. Party sources said there were at least three serious contenders from the grassroots level in Sira, and they could emerge spoilsport for the party. Sunday also witnessed a large number of JD(S) workers from Sira joining the Congress, now helmed in the State by Vokkaliga leader D.K. Shivakumar.

Sources said the JD(S) was currently faced with not only problems related to the choice of candidates, but also other issues such as finances to meet the bypoll costs. The party’s R.R.

“Only those with a weavers’ card has received the ₹2,000 aid. But there are a large number of weavers without the card,” said Yellanna Ganti. This is the reality across the State, many weavers said.

Speaking on the loan-waiver scheme announced by Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa in 2019-2020, weaver and activist from Yadgir Sangayya Mante said that the restrictions on the beneficiaries has also kept many out of the ambit.

According to data, the State government has allocated a total of ₹79.57 crore towards loan waiver of which ₹57.08 crore has been released. So far, ₹42.64 crore is disbursed.

107,2020/10/05,Minister C.T. Ravi tenders resignation,"Tourism Minister C.T. Ravi, who was appointed as a BJP national general secretary recently, has submitted his resignation from the ministerial post.

While the resignation was tendered on Saturday to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, it has not been accepted yet, sources in the Chief Minister’s Office said. Mr. Yediyurappa is learnt to have told Mr. Ravi, who is leaving for Delhi to attend a two-day party office-bearers’ meeting scheduled from Monday, to wait till the high command decides on the issue. Sources said that Mr. Ravi met Mr. Yediyurappa on Saturday morning to hand over the resignation letter, and his decision has been conveyed to leaders in the national capital

“I have tendered my resignation since it will be difficult to manage two posts simultaneously. I have to give more time to the organisation as a party functionary,” the Minister told presspersons on Sunday.

Soon after his elevation in the party, it was widely speculated that he would step down from the Cabinet considering the ‘one man, one post’ rule. If the resignation of is accepted, the number of vacancies in the Cabinet will go up to seven. This is likely to give some breathing space for Mr. Yediyurappa, who is under pressure to expand his Cabinet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/j92jf/article32767940.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THLTCTRAVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/minister-ct-ravi-tenders-resignation/article32767938.ece
108,2020/10/05,"Once an IT engineer, now a proud farmer","Sathish Hudgi, a 41-year old software engineer from Halakunda village in Kalaburagi district, who had worked with many companies in India, the U.S. and in Dubai for 14 years, has now been a proud farmer of his village for a couple of years now.

“The monotonous routine of work bored me. It provoked me to do something different and be creative to rejuvenate my life. A thought of taking up agriculture on 12 acres of my ancestral land prompted me to leave a lucrative job and take up agriculture as business,” Mr. Hudgi told The Hindu on Sunday.

When he landed in his village after giving up a job in Dubai that was fetching him 30,000 Dirham (about ₹ 6 lakh) a month, the community around him was unwelcoming.

Some laughed at him while others tried to discourage him. But, he continued with his plans. He got borewells drilled and had solar pumpsets, drip irrigation system and CCTV cameras installed at the farm, got the soil tested, consulted farm scientists at Kalaburagi’s Krishi Vigyan Kendra and so on and so forth.

“In 2018, I experimented with onions on one acre. The yield was wonderful, but the price had fallen. It was break-even with no loss and no gain. The yield, however, gave me confidence and I moved ahead to experiment with sweet corn and watermelon. Watermelon cultivation in an acre of land fetched me ₹ 1.60 lakh net profit in just two months. The sweet corn in two acres gave me ₹ 2 lakh net profit,” Mr. Hudgi said.

After two years of hard work, Mr. Hudgi is now more confident. Mr. Hudgi’s case is not an isolated one as hundreds of highly educated individuals are showing more interest in agriculture, particularly after the outbreak of COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown.

Shankar Rathod, for instance, who had worked as a chartered engineer since 2006, has now taken up anjeer, lemon, jackfruit, mango and coconut cultivation.

Srinivas Rathod, who worked as lecturer in engineering colleges at Bhopal, Jaipur and other cities, has returned to his native place after the outbreak of COVID-19. He is now seriously thinking of undertaking agriculture.

Mohammad Pasha, who worked as a manager at a Pune-based export company, is now planning to cultivate his 11 acres of land and also develop a business of exporting agricultural produces.

“After most of the sectors were hit by the pandemic, the educated class has realised that agriculture is one of the good and sustainable sectors to invest in and work on. Doctors, engineers, advocates, lecturers working on contract basis and other professionals, some of whom have returned from different countries, are visiting the KVK to inquire about the latest farming technologies, crop varieties, market availability and suitable crop pattern for Kalaburagi weather,” P. Vasudev Naik, horticulture scientist, told The Hindu.

Raju Teggali, an entomologist who heads the Kalaburagi KVK, said that most of the educated and foreign-returned were showing interest in advanced technologies such as polyhouse farming.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q67vtu/article32767863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGKALABURAGIFARMING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/once-an-it-engineer-now-a-proud-farmer/article32767864.ece

The local people and the Forest Department staff noticed the calf struggling to stand. They could reach near the calf only on Saturday, when the mother moved a few metres away.

Sivaram Babu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu, “The calf had no milk from the mother since its birth, as it could not stand. The staff took care of the calf and fed lactose. Muruli, the veterinarian, provided the calf with saline and glucose. Later we took the calf for scanning at the Veterinary College in Hassan. The report showed fractures on its forelimbs.”

112,2020/10/05,Surge in COVID-19 cases impacting Mysuru’s industrial activity,"Most firms are still functioning at about 50% of their capacity when compared to pre-COVID-19 scenario where the manufacturing sector had 85-90% of the workforce

More than six months into the pandemic, the industrial scenario in Mysuru – as elsewhere in the State – is beginning to look up, but only marginally.

The city known to be a cluster and hub for ancillary units for the auto component sector is gaining traction but most firms are still functioning at about 50 to 60% of their capacity.

Though there are signs of revival, it is too early to suggest that the manufacturing was fully back on track, said Ramprasad from the Nanjangud Industries’ Association. He said industries were beginning to get orders but a majority of the firms were doing with two shifts instead of three of 8 hours each.

“This is a far cry from the pre-COVID-19 scenario where the manufacturing sector would function at 85% to 90% of the capacity. But this is surely an improvement over the situation that prevailed during the lockdown,” said Suresh Kumar Jain, General Secretary, Mysuru Industries Association.

He said the labour force is back in most factories though the migrant labourers from U.P., Bihar and other States who constituted the bulk of the work force have not returned.

However, there is growing concern among the manufacturers that the surge in the pandemic was preventing the industrial units from working at their full capacity.

“The auto sector is showing signs of revival and the demand for components has gone up compared to what it was a few months ago. This is an encouraging sign. But the COVID-19 spread is decelerating any efforts to ramp up production,” said Sudhakar Shetty of the Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI).

This is because the surge in the COVID-19 cases had led to adopting new protocols with reduced work force to ensure social distancing.

Only a fraction of the workers are being deployed during a shift and whenever an employee tests positive, the entire manufacturing process gets disturbed for a few days and this was becoming a regular affair, said Mr. Jain.

That the manufacturing sector and the industrial activity were yet to regain full traction is also evident in the power consumption which has declined.

“Nanjangud industrial area used to run up a bill of ₹15 crore to ₹20 crore per month towards electricity charges. But in the recent months following the pandemic, this hovers around ₹7 crore to ₹8 crore, which is an indication that the manufacturing units are functioning at half the capacity,” Mr. Ramprasad added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uwd68e/article32767748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGINDUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/surge-in-covid-19-cases-impacting-mysurus-industrial-activity/article32767749.ece
113,2020/10/05,Teerthodbhava: MLA suggests devotees to bring COVID-19 certificate,"All rituals to be held as per schedule

There are suggestions that devotees keen to participate and witness the Cauvery Teerthodbhava at the birthplace of river Cauvery on October 17 be advised to bring a COVID-19 negative certificate.

This is in view of the surge in the cases across the State and the imperatives of preventing its spread by discouraging mass gathering. The suggestion was made by Appachu Ranjan, MLA, who urged the authorities to ensure that people coming to the event be armed with the certificate.

Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy said a medical team will be asked to assess the modalities on its implementation and whether it was practical. She said it was one of the suggestions discussed in the meeting held on Saturday but no final decision had been taken yet.

Kodagu district in charge Minister V. Somanna said all the rituals and traditions associated with the event will be held as per schedule and the district administration and Muzrai Department were directed to ensure that preparations and arrangements are in place. The Minister also handed over a cheque for ₹1 crore towards the development of Talacauvery.

It was also decided that devotees would not be allowed to take a dip in the kalyani and instead holy water would be sprinkled after the Teerthodbhava which is scheduled to take place on October 17 at 7.03 a.m. Teerthodbhava refers to water gushing out from the Brahmakundike at the birthplace of the Cauvery at a specified time to witness which devotees gather in large numbers every year and also take a bath in the large kalyani or pond.

Road repair

Mr. Somanna also directed the PWD to ensure that all roads connecting to Bhagamandala and Talacauvery were repaired.

114,2020/10/05,"Tests made mandatory for street vendors, retailers","Mysuru city reports 1,514 new COVID-19 cases, which is highest since the pandemic broke out

All street vendors in the city and retailers at the three main markets, including the Devaraja Market, have been directed to get themselves tested for COVID-19 within a week.

This was decided by the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) authorities in a bid to curb the possible spread of the cases which is on the rise in the city.

Mysuru reported 1,514 new cases on Saturday – the highest since the pandemic broke out – sending the authorities into a tizzy. The district has also recorded 798 cumulative deaths and has become a major source of worry for the administration. Hence the authorities though it fit to increase testing in places where there is large public movement and transaction as in case of the main markets.

Gurudutt Hegde, Commissioner, MCC, said there are nearly 900 vendors and merchants in Devaraja Market alone and they expect about 2,000 vendors to be covered from the three markets, including the Mandi and Vani Vilas markets. In addition, there are over 2,000 registered street vendors in the city as per the 2018 records but the actual numbers are manifold as not all have registered.

“We have given them one week’s time for getting tested for COVID-19. Our mobile teams will also visit the three markets and the vendors can make use of the opportunity to get themselves tested,” said Mr. Hegde.

But this is not a one-time testing and the MCC has announced that repeat tests will be necessary to ensure that those testing positive are quarantined and do not come in contact with the public. “Vendors have to get themselves tested once in a fortnight and the police will be empowered to enforce the rules,” said the Commissioner.

As part of the unlocking, markets have opened but it has been found that in most cases both the vendors and the customers tend to be casual about wearing masks while social distancing is compromised. Mr. Hegde said they have ramped up the capacity for testing and the mobile units will offer both RT-PCR and rapid tests.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kyvvg7/article32767728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGVENDORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tests-made-mandatory-for-street-vendors-retailers/article32767729.ece
115,2020/10/05,Testing facilities ramped up in Mysuru,"Rapid Antigen Test and RT-PCR will be offered for free

The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has set up COVID-19 testing facilities at 22 different locations in the city. MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde has called upon people with symptoms of the virus to mandatorily undergo the tests, which will be offered for free.

Soon after the number of positive cases in Mysuru district crossed 1,500 to reach 1,514 on Saturday, the MCC Commissioner announced the ramping up of the testing facility in the city, which accounts for a majority of the cases in the district.

The MCC, along with the District Health and Family Welfare Department, has taken steps to subject a lot more people to COVID-19 tests in view of the rising number of cases and mortality in the city, said Mr. Hegde. Both Rapid Antigen Tests as well as RT-PCR will be will conducted at these testing facilities, said a MCC statement.

Persons with cold, cough, fever, breathing difficulty, loose motions, besides loss of taste and smell, should undergo tests. Also, all persons who are primary and secondary contacts of COVID-19 patients should approach these testing facilities. Mr. Hegde said efforts were also underway to establish a 24/7 testing facility at K.R. Hospital in the city from October 5 for the benefit of the public.

Also, the Health and Family Welfare Department had set up mobile squads, which will be carrying out COVID-19 tests in industrial areas and slums free of cost.

Cases rise

Meanwhile, with 1,514 people testing positive for COVID-19 on Saturday, Mysuru district’s cumulative positive cases stands at 36,291. With 18 people succumbing to COVID-19 on Saturday, the total number of persons dying in Mysuru district rose to 798.

However, the number of persons discharged on Saturday was 859. Out of the total 7,098 active cases as on Saturday, 5,179 had been isolated in their respective homes while the remaining in COVID-19 Care Centres.

116,2020/10/05,"RTOs given target of 26,000 cases a month","Transport Commissioner warns officials of action for lapses in enforcement

Meeting targets and generating revenue is not limited to the corporate world alone. Officials at Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) have been given targets to meet for filing cases. After being directed by the State government to take action against motorists flouting road safety rules, the Transport Commissioner has directed RTOs to file 26,000 cases every month.

“Targets have been fixed for each RTO. Instructions have been given to them to book cases pertaining to overloading, not wearing seatbelts, unauthorised modification of vehicles, and others. In August, the field officials managed to achieve 80% of their targets,” said Transport Commissioner N. Shivkumar. The Commissioner had also warned of taking action against officials in charge for lapses in enforcement activities.

However, following this is not an easy task for field officials who say they are understaffed. The shortage of motor vehicle inspectors at the RTO level is a burden, said one field official. According to sources, the department has around 214 senior inspector posts of which only 116 are filled. There are 430 posts for inspectors but only 125 inspectors are working; the remaining posts are vacant. Due to various factors including legal issues, posts remain vacant for years.

An RTO official pointed out that targets have to be met in conjunction with other department work. “We have to manage with the available staff and book cases against violators. In addition to staff shortage, we are facing other issues too,” said an RTO official. He pointed out that while the traffic police in Bengaluru are using gadgets to file cases, they are stuck with issuing challans. “With this outdated system, it takes us at least 20 minutes to file a case. There is a need to shift to advanced technology to carry out enforcement. We are also facing problems of space when it comes to parking impounded vehicles in Bengaluru,” the official added.

Accusations

Some of the RTOs in Bengaluru are also facing accusations that they are using unauthorised people to flag down the vehicles on roads.

Vishwanth, secretary of the Federation of Karnataka Lorry Owners’ Association, said, “On highways, lorry drivers are often subjected to harassment. Officials use unauthorised people to collect money from the drivers and cases are filed against only a few vehicles. Higher ups in the department must address these issues while instructing field officials to do more enforcement activities. If not, this harassment will continue.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8dshv7/article32767697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGRTO1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rtos-given-target-of-26000-cases-a-month/article32767698.ece

Many alumni and students from Mount Carmel College and the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, have condemned the brutal attack on a Dalit girl in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, and the response by the government machinery to the crime.

In a letter to the Prime Minister, faculty, students and alumni of IIMB also sought support for the victim’s family. “We seek assurance that the family will not be intimidated, but rather supported to get justice,” the letter said.

“We demand that our law and order system follows due process. Not encounters. Not cover-ups. Not extra-judicial killings. Not use tools of governance against us every time we peacefully protest actions of our government,” said the 187 signatories.

The letter goes on to read:. “We stand together and say “Enough!” This stops in our generation. This stops with us.”

In an open letter to the Union Home Minister and the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, many students and alumni of Mount Carmel College took objection to the response of the U.P. government and statements by police officials denying the rape.

“These statements and actions provide excuses and only serve to strengthen patriarchal mindsets and the impunity that upper caste men, including Thakurs and Brahmins, enjoy,” they wrote.

They also demanded that recommendation by the SIT to conduct narcoanalysis tests on the victim’s family members be withdrawn. “With most of these cases meeting the same fate, that of negligent investigation and inaction against the accused, members of the upper castes have been allowed to retaliate against the reporting of cases with further brutality,” they wrote.

119,2020/10/05,"Doctors, nurses of Kerala medical colleges cancel strike plan","Action on the basis of detailed report by DME, promises Minister

Faculty of government medical colleges in the State and a section of the nurses’ fraternity, who were threatening to go on an indefinite strike boycotting all non-COVID-19 duties and online classes from Tuesday demanding that the suspension orders of their colleagues be revoked, have cancelled their strike plan following talks with Health Minister K.K. Shylaja here on Monday.

Doctors and nurses at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thiruvananthapuram, have been on the path of agitation since Friday after the government issued orders suspending the COVID-19 Nodal Officer as well as two head nurses for the negligence in the care of an elderly patient. They were soon joined by their colleagues in other MCHs too, all of whom stayed away from OP duties for two hours on Monday.

Doctors decided to stand down and cancel strike plan after the Health Minister assured them that the government would take action only on the basis of a detailed inquiry report filed by the Director of Medical Education (DME).

However, Ms. Shylaja said nothing about revoking the suspension orders, which had been the main demand of the doctors.

Staff shortage

Medical fraternity had pointed out that the acute shortage of support staff had led to the unfortunate incident involving the patient.

Addressing the media, Ms. Shylaja said that the sacrifices by health-care workers and the dedication with which they had been fighting on the front lines, taking care of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were much valued. However, even when isolated incidents of negligence occurred, the government would have to take action and the suspension orders were issued as a temporary measure while waiting for the detailed inquiry report.

DME gives report

The report had been submitted by the DME on Monday evening and the government would take remedial action on the basis of the report within 24 hours, she said.

120,2020/10/05,Mediation attempt in church row fails again,"Orthodox, Jacobite factions stick to their stances; further talks likely

The attempt by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to mediate between the warring Orthodox and Jacobite factions of the Malankara church failed once again on Monday, with the groups sticking to their stances.

While the Orthodox faction stood firm on settling the issue within the framework of the Supreme Court order, the Jacobite faction held that it wanted to part ways with the Orthodox group and to exist as a separate church.

‘Must part ways’

According to the Jacobite faction, there is no scope for reconciliation between the groups but the government must end ‘capturing’ churches in the name of the Supreme Court verdict. “We must part ways, there is no alternative. At the same time, the government must end the takeover of churches for the Orthodox group,” said a spokesman after discussions with the State government in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday.

He said the government promised to continue the discussions in a bid to reconcile the issues between the groups.

Bishops Thomas Mar Themotheos, Kuriakose Mar Thephilos and Geevarghese Mar Kurilos were in the Jacobite team that participated in the discussions on Monday.

The Orthodox faction was represented by Gabriel Mar Gregorios, Metropolitan of the Thiruvananthapuram diocese; Thomas Mar Athanasius, Metropolitan of the Kandanad East diocese; and Yuhanon Mar Diascoros, synod secretary.

‘Meaningful attempt’

Addressing the media after the discussions, the Orthodox faction termed the mediation a meaningful attempt as this was for the first time that both groups came together after discussions were held in 1995. “The Jacobite faction appears hell-bent on settling the issue by bypassing the court orders as well as the Constitution of India. The State government, however, has acknowledged its responsibility to abide by the court order,” they said.

According to the Orthodox faction, both groups have agreed to sit together and deliberate the issue once again in the presence of the Chief Minister.

121,2020/10/05,COVID-19 | Results of withheld sero survey expose a ‘lost chance’,"1.10 lakh people could have been infected in May-end and proper intervention might have helped detect more cases early

After a lag of three months, Kerala has released the report of the baseline sero surveillance study it did in June, piggybacking on Indian Council of Medical Research’s report of the second round of sero survey conducted in the State in August as part of a national survey.

Despite the alleged shortcomings in the study, the fact that nothing was done to analyse the data and put it to practical use can be seen as a lost opportunity to check the spread of COVID-19, public health experts say.

Study abandoned

The study was done in 9,483 individuals using rapid antibody kits during June 8-14 to find out baseline sero prevalence in the community and determine the proportion of the population which had prior silent exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, the study was abandoned by the Health Department after the first round itself following problems with the test kits.

The report now released says the proportion of IgG positivity (indicative of silent prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2) was high amongst those in institutional quarantine (19%), home quarantine (6%) and expatriates (5%). Eliminating these groups, the proportion of IgG positivity was between 0.2 and 0.5%. IgG positivity in samples from the elderly and epidemiological samples together was 0.38%. Among health-care workers, it was 0.5% (COVID and non-COVID hospitals). It also detected 13 cases of active infection (reconfirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) from amongst those tested IgM positive.

Same as ICMR stats

The report says IgG positivity in non-exposed groups, which means the general community, was consistent with the data from the first round of the ICMR sero surveillance done during May 18-23, which put the IgG positivity at 0.33%.

Going by the State’s (and ICMR’s) estimate of 0.33% of past infection in May, when extrapolated to the State’s population of 3.34 crore would translate to 1,10,240 infected individuals. The actual cases detected in Kerala then were less than 1,000.

Though a chunk of the individuals would be asymptomatic and would defy detection, they would still transmit the infection. But the narrative at the time was about how the State had COVID-19 under control.

That 0.5% of health-care workers in both COVID and non-COVID hospitals had prior exposure to COVID was another indicator that infection was actively being transmitted in the community, brought into hospitals by patients.

Second round

“The ICMR’s second round of study done in the same districts during August 24-26 found IgG positivity to have gone up to 0.8%. This would translate to 2,67,250 infected individuals in the general population, when on August 10 the detected cases was only 35,515.

“Had the State kept the sero survey data in perspective and invested in more RT-PCR testing and in better distribution of testing sites, more cases could have been picked up early,” a senior public health professional said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nxlm0l/article32777153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OXYGEN-CYLINDERS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-releases-its-first-sero-survey-results/article32775630.ece

128,2020/10/05,Rehabilitation of landslip victims moving fast,"The government has already identified 50 cents of land for construction of eight houses

IDUKKI

It is two months since the major landslip at Pettimudy happened and the district administration is gearing up to rehabilitate eight families at Kuttiyarvalley and provide compensation to the kins of the victims.

Devikulam Subcollector S. Prem Krishnan said the government had already identified 50 cents of land for construction of eight houses, each of which would get about five cents each.

The District Collector had written to the government for a special sanction to allot title deeds to the eight families found as legal heirs of the victims of the landslip on August 6. The special sanction was sought, as there would be delay in allotting the title deeds to the land in the normal process.

As per the agreement, the Kanan Devan Hills Plantation (KDHP) Ltd would start construction of the houses at Kuttiyarvalley as soon as the title deeds of land were made available.

In addition to the houses, there would be an approach road with a water supply and power connection. The compensation amount would be given in a week’s time. The KDHP Ltd, State government, and Tamil Nadu government had announced compensation to the legal heirs of the victims. The compensation amount by the KDHP and Kerala governments would be ₹5 lakh each. The Tamil Nadu government also announced a compensation of ₹2 lakh.

In the ill-fated landslip on August 6, four estate lanes at Pettimudy were buried under the debris. A search operation extending to nearly a month found 66 bodies. As per the official estimate, four persons were still missing. A large number of families living in the estate lanes at Pettimudy had either migrated to their native places in Tamil Nadu or shifted to other estate lanes under the KDHP.

However, a trade union leader said the Pettimudy accident should open the eyes of the authorities towards the pathetic living conditions of the workers in the estate lanes. All the lanes were set up during the early plantation era and only minimal maintenance work was annually done by the companies. In the case of closed tea estates, the maintenance works were not done for over a decade.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rehabilitation-of-landslip-victims-moving-fast/article32775325.ece

130,2020/10/05,HC dismisses plea against selection of films,"Petition against inclusion of film directed by Kamal’s son

The Kerala High Court on Monday dismissed a writ petition alleging malpractice in the selection of the movie, 9, starring Pritviraj and directed by Jenuse Mohammed, son of Kamal, chairman of Kerala State Chalachitra Academy, for the 2019 State film awards.

The petition was filed by directors, Sathish Babusenon and Shinos A. Rahman, and music composer K. Santhosh.

Petitioners’ charge

They alleged that there was nepotism in the selection of 9 in the competition section. According to them, the guidelines had prevented jury members or their close relatives from sending films for awards.

The petitioners sought a directive to the academy secretary to ask the jury of the State film awards not to consider the film for any award. They also alleged that the academy had rushed through the screening process despite the closure of theatres and auditoriums.

Court’s observation

Dismissing the petition, Justice N. Nagaresh observed that the academy had no power to reject any application for entry. The entries were adjudged by an independent jury constituted by the government. Therefore, it could not be held that the Chairman or Executive Board of the Academy could influence the outcome of the competition.

The court added that jury members were eminent personalities in film and allied fields. To exclude any possibility of bias in the selection of films for award, the regulations mandated that all jury members should submit a signed affidavit in the prescribed format stating non-involvement of them or any of those relatives in the entries. The provision would practically exclude any kind of bias or favouritism arising out of kinship.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-dismisses-plea-against-selection-of-films/article32775257.ece
131,2020/10/05,Vizhinjam to be declared crew change and bunkering hub,"50th vessel exercises facility off port on Monday

The stage is set for Vizhinjam being declared as international crew change and bunkering hub with the 50th vessel exercising the facility off the port on Monday.

Nave Buena Suerte, a crude oil tanker under the flag of Hong Kong and moving from Singapore, exercised the facility three nautical miles within the Vizhinjam port limits, helping seven seafarers to sign off and 10 to sign on.

This is the 50th vessel since the outer anchorage crew change began off Vizhinjam port on July 14 opening new business opportunities for shipping companies, transshipment service providers, and the travel trade. Ever Globe, a 2.19-lakh tonnage container ship, sailing under the flag of Panama from Egypt to Colombo, was the first to exercise this facility.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will soon make the declaration as Vizhinjam already occupies a place in the international maritime map. The Kerala Maritime Board, shipping agents and other stakeholders have commenced steps to exploit the demand for anchorage, the cheapest option for cargo-laden ships to drop off crew working beyond their contract tenure and to bring in relievers to the vessel.

Lack of facilities

Lack of tugs and infrastructure facilities in the harbour and the laxity on the part of the officials to give speedy clearance are the hurdles to the port emerging as a permanent crew change destination like Mumbai, Kochi, and Goa ports. A tug of the Maritime Board and another hired one are being used now.

“We need rooms for the crew, Customs, Immigration and port agents. For bunkering to take off, the government should provide land close to the coast for constructing tanks for oil storage. The oil companies are willing to come forward. The State should also reduce the tax for bunkering,” says Jude Sajith D’cruz, managing director of Dowins Resources, shipping agents.

Making available food, drinking water, maintenance of the vessel, providing spare parts, fuelling, and cleaning of the tankers are the opportunities that can be provided once the facilities for bunkering hub is set up.

Good potential

“We are taking steps to create the requisite facilities and offer bunkering facilities in the days ahead as crew change and bunkering have good potential,” says Board Chairman V.J. Mathew. The State exchequer has benefited as ₹50 lakh has been obtained through the outer anchorage and crew change.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/te3ip5/article32775190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201005-WA0095,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vizhinjam-to-be-declared-crew-change-and-bunkering-hub/article32775136.ece
132,2020/10/05,CM launches power projects in Kottayam and Pathanamthitta,"Kerala has taken a big leap towards ensuring power security by covering its entire area under the inter-State power transmission network, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

He was inaugurating a slew of projects in the State’s power sector including the construction of a 400-KV Gas Insulated Sub-station (GIS) at Kuruvilangadu in Kottayam and the opening of a110-KV substation at Thiruvalla through video conference on Monday.

According to the Chief Minister, the restoration of the Edamon-Kochi 400-KV Power Highway has helped bring down the transmission loss from Kudamkulam to a great extent. The HVDC line from Pukalur in Tamil Nadu and its substation at Thrissur, a project, which was stalled due to various reasons, too is nearing completion.

Minister for Electricity, who presided over the function, said plans were afoot to appoint 436-meter readers and 97 assistant engineers in the Kerala State Electricity Board. The department had so far provided permanent employment to over 34,000 persons and of these, as many as 4,230 were appointed during the last four years, he said.

The proposed GIS sub-station in Kottayam forms part of the ₹10,000-crore Transgrid project, which seeks to double the domestic transmission capacity of Kerala. On completion, it will become the first 400-KV sub-station to come up in the district.

The project, being established at a 15-acre property near Njaralamkulam, is slated to be operational in two years from now and will help reduce the overall transmission loss and save 1196.5 lakh units of electricity per year.

The station will receive power from the Kudamkulam power line and redistribute the power through six feeders. The State government has accorded an administrative sanction of ₹285 crore through the KIIFB for completing the project.

Meanwhile, the authorities have expended ₹2.95 crore for upgrading the 66 KV sub-station at Thiruvalla as 110 KV sub-station by connecting it to the Mallappally-Chengannur 110 KV using underground cable. The project will help ensure uninterrupted power supply to as many as 45,000 consumers in and around the region.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-launches-power-projects-in-kottayam-and-pathanamthitta/article32774971.ece
133,2020/10/05,MGU law students call for timely conduct of exams,"Delay will affect academic and career prospects, says students’ collective

Law students in colleges affiliated to the Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU) fear that the delay in the conduct of pending semester exams will affect their academic and career prospects.

The students have formed a collective to press their demand for the timely conduct of the semester exams. The varsity has not yet scheduled exams for the ninth and tenth semester students. Any further delay will affect their plans to pursue higher studies. Those wishing to pursue a career in law would also be affected, they said.

A student representative pointed out that the fourth and fifth semester exams for students now in their sixth semester were pending. The exams for two semesters remain pending for those in the eighth semester. For those who have completed their fourth semester, three exams are pending. The results of exams that were held earlier had not been published yet, she said.

The students alleged that the pending exams should have been held before the outbreak of COVID-19. The five-year LL.B course will be stretched following the delay in the conduct of exams and the publication of results. The students said they had petitioned the Governor (Chancellor of the varsity) and the Higher Education Minister regarding the delay.

The university authorities referred to a strike by the students demanding that the end semester exams should be held ahead of the other semesters. The fourth semester exams were postponed following the strike. “However, we have decided to schedule the pending exams without delay. The process will start by this week,” they said.

The collective demanding speedy conduct of exams includes students from Government Law College, Ernakulam; Bharata Mata School of Legal Studies, Ernakulam; S.N. College, Poothotta; CSI College for Legal Studies, Kottayam; Al Azhar Law College, Thodupuzha; Mount Zion Law College, Kadamanitta; and Co-operative School of Law, Thodupuzha.

134,2020/10/05,Catfish species rediscovered in Puduchery,"Though a French zoologist reported it in 1839, Mystus keletius was confused with another species since then

A catfish first described by a French zoologist in 1839, but since then was confused with another species, has now been rediscovered from Puducherry and identified as a distinct species.

The species Mystus keletius was rediscovered by Mathews Plamootil, head of the department, Department of Zoology, BJM Government College, Chavara, from a freshwater body in Puducherry. The finding has been published in the Indian Journal of Applied and Pure Biology, a UGC-approved journal.

“French zoologist Achille Valenciennes discovered and described the species in 1839 from Puducherry, but he had not deposited specimens in any museum. Moreover, after the original discovery, no specimen was collected again from the region. Later on, many scientists took this fish to be the same as Mystus vittatus reported by the German zoologist Marcus Elieser Bloch from Tharangambadi (formerly Tranquebar) in Tamil Nadu,” Dr. Plamootil said.

Edible, but not abundant

In Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, fish belonging to the genus Mystus is locally known as ‘Kelethi.’ Brown and yellow in colour, Mystus keletius can grow to lengths ranging from 101 mm to 111.5 mm. Though an edible fish, it is not found in great abundance. A comparison of the physical characteristics of the two species proves that Mystus keletius is not the same as Mystus vittatus or any other catfish, he said.

135,2020/10/05,HC seeks clarification from CBI on FCRA violations,"Funds received by Unitac for the execution of LIFE Mission project

The Kerala High Court on Wednesday asked the CBI to inform the court whether funds received by the Unitac Builders Private Ltd. as part of the LIFE Mission project would come under the definition of foreign contribution and whether the Mission and the company had been exempted from foreign contribution regulation laws.

Justice V.G. Arun passed the directive while hearing arguments on a writ petition filed by Santhosh Eapen of Unitac Builders Private Ltd. seeking to quash the FIR registered against him in connection with the construction of homes under the LIFE Mission project at Wadakanchery, Thrissur.

The CBI counsel submitted that LIFE Mission would come under the purview of the Act and kickbacks were involved in the deal.

Petitioner’s contention

The petitioner had said that he had handed over crores of rupees to several persons at the instructions of Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the diplomatic gold smuggling case.

A foreign contribution received should not be diverted for any other purpose. In fact, investigation had to be carried out to find out whether the money had been transferred to officials of LIFE Mission or not.

The petitioner had himself pointed out that money had been given to the economic head of the UAE consulate, the CBI said.

The petitioner said that it was the UAE consulate which had awarded the contract to the petitioner for constructing residential apartments and a hospital in Wadakanchery under of Kerala’s LIFE Mission project.

What the FIR says

The FIR had alleged commission of offences under Sections 3 and 35 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) against the petitioner and LIFE Mission officials.

The company also pointed out that the construction was undertaken following an agreement executed between the company and the UAE based on an MoU signed between the State government and the UAE-Red Crescent.

The petitioner pointed out that the contribution received towards the cost of goods/service rendered could not be considered foreign contribution as per the 3rd explanation of Section 2[h] of the Act.

Besides,the LIFE Mission was exempted from the provision of the Act through a notification issued by the Central government .The petitioner was only executing the works as a part of the LIFE Mission project of the government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-seeks-clarification-from-cbi-on-fcra-violations/article32774828.ece
136,2020/10/05,Kerala mulls self-certification to build small houses,"LSGD plans rule for dwellings below 300 sq ft to ease the process for lower income groups

The Local Self-Government Department (LSGD) is considering the introduction of a self-certification system for construction of houses below 300 square feet, with an aim to ease the process for lower income groups. But, the required change can be brought about only after amending the Kerala Municipality Act and the Panchayat Raj Act and considering the technical issues in allowing such leeway without checking whether the house is to be built in paddy land or wetland or in CRZ (Coastal Regulation Zone) zones.

Engineer to certify

According to LSGD sources, the proposal was considered along with the amendments to building which were notified recently, but the propsal was set aside at that time due to the changes required in the Acts. As per the plan, the owner can get a certified engineer to certify that the construction of the house below 300 sq ft will be carried out within the rules. Once this self-certification is submitted to the local body, construction can begin after a specific time period of a week or two, in case there are no objections.

Inspection

An official from the local body needs to inspect the construction before it reaches lintel level to ensure that all setback measurements are being followed. In case of violations, the construction can be stopped. Recently, States such as Telangana and Punjab tried the self-certification system, which is expected to save on the waiting time in processing building permit applications for those constructing small dwellings.

In grade 2 panchayats, classified so based on lower annual revenue, construction of houses can be done without permit for buildings of area up to 1,000 sq ft. But, this became an issue as some banks insisted on building permit number for sanctioning loans. Panchayat secretaries were also reluctant to issue permits in cases where there was no need for these, forcing some to redraw the plan and construct houses above 1,000 sq ft. This situation had led to the government introducing an amendment recently that building permit should be issued even in such cases, if the building owner demands.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-mulls-self-certification-to-build-small-houses/article32774548.ece

138,2020/10/05,"Come up with good case, court tells NIA","Slapping of UAPA against accused in the gold smuggling case

The Special Judge of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Court trying the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case against the accused in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case wanted the investigation agency to come up with a “good case” to substantiate its findings against the second line of accused in the case.

It was while considering the bail applications six accused on Monday that the court issued the directive to the agency.

If the agency fails to present a convincing case on Tuesday to justify allegations against the second line of accused, the judge said he would be inclined to favourably consider the bail application of the accused.

‘Delineate charges’

The court wanted the investigation agency to delineate the charges against the front-line accused and others.

The agency had invoked the Act against a few accused who had allegedly invested money for purchasing the gold, which was to be smuggled to India and those who had purchased the smuggled gold.

The court also instructed the agency to produce the case diary before it on Tuesday. The agency shall mark out the allegations raised against the accused in the case diary. If the allegations are not marked out against the accused and substantiated, the court shall assess it and take a decision on the bail application, said P. Krishnakumar, the Special Judge.

Accused’s contention

The three lawyers, who appeared for the accused, pointed out that the investigation agency could not come up with any evidence to prove the charges that the accused used the proceeds of the gold smuggling for terrorism activities or for funding terrorist organisations.

They contended that the UAPA charges would not stand against the accused.

They submitted that there had not been any significant progress in the investigation. The accused have spend already 80 days in the custody of the investigation agency. This was a case to be dealt under the Customs Act and not under the UAPA, they contended.

The NIA submitted that Vijayakumar P., Assistant Solicitor General, would appear in the case when the court considers the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/come-up-with-good-case-court-tells-nia/article32774389.ece
139,2020/10/05,NEP promotes research culture: CUK VC,"It is likely to have a significant impact on research funding: H. Venkateshwarlu

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages a robust research ecosystem and lays the framework for promoting research and innovation right from the school level, H. Venkateshwarlu, Vice Chancellor, Central University of Kerala (CUK), Kasaragod, has said.

Prof. Venkateshwarlu, who assumed charge at the helm of CUK two months ago, told The Hindu that the policy document identifies the lacunae that hindered the evolution of a strong research culture in higher educational institutions.

“To promote a conducive environment for innovation, we will have to address our approach to integrity in research; and existing standards, protocols and policies in research organisations,” he said.

Hailing the plan to establish the National Research Foundation (NRF) as a progressive move, he said that the proposed agency will facilitate incentives for outstanding research, even while funding institutions such as DST, DBT, ICAR and ICSSR will continue funding research in priority areas. In effect, the endeavour is likely to have a significant impact on research funding.

The NEP 2020 which, he said, augers well for promoting research and innovation from the school level laid emphasis on more play and discovery-based style of learning.

“The curricula and methods of teaching and evaluation will have to be flexible to promote a research culture. Ample freedom has to be allotted to students to ask questions and to explore the problems posed to them. Kindling their curiosity and a perfect understanding of what makes them interested is very essential to build up an innovative mind. We can develop curious and innovative minds among school students if we succeed in implementing the real spirit of NEP 2020. The benefit of such efforts will gradually translate to the higher education level,” the academician said.

Prof. Venkateshwarlu called for urgent steps to realise the target to spend 6% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for education and earmarking a sufficient portion for research. Researchers across higher education institutions and research organisations must be encouraged to take up research on study areas including socio-economic aspects, culture and science, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nep-promotes-research-culture-cuk-vc/article32774134.ece
140,2020/10/05,Step towards Green Homes through children,"OEOH is part of the WWF-India’s pan-India programme for school students from Class I -VIII

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM

‘Oru Bhoomi, Oru Bhavanam’, an action-oriented initiative to steer up Green Homes by adoption of green habits by the students, has been launched by the Kerala chapter of the WWF-India.

The initiative is part of the WWF-India’s pan-India programme for school students from Class I -VIII stretching over 10 weeks titled ‘One Earth, One Home’ (OEOH).

‘Oru Bhoomi, Oru Bhavanam’ is being implemented in association with school chains like Bhavans Vidyalaya, Bharatiya Vidya Nikethan, CSI Management Schools, and five CBSE schools of Thiruvananthapuram district.

Two State-level teacher orientation programmes have been conducted online over the Zoom platform, which had 174 and 325 participants including school management and administration representatives and teachers. An initial baseline assessment will now be conducted as part of the monitoring and evaluation. Programme content then will be shared online with the participants.

The teachers, students and their families can take it slowly over the next 10 weeks period with regular interaction and feedback with the organisers through the various online platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook. The programme will wind up with an end-line assessment to understand the impact.

Renjan Mathew Varghese, State Director (Kerala), WWF India, said “we envisage less talk, more action through the action-oriented OEOH program. The content has been made available both in English and Malayalam to benefit maximum students”.

Since it is on the digital platform, and does not incur cost in printing and dispatch, it can give maximum outreach across the State. The program has been designed with a lot of thinking and brainstorming going into developing the contents, he said.

Aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the OEOH content is available in 10 languages on MHRD’s DIKSHA platform and State education portals. The contents are mainly videos and worksheets structured in three simple steps—Seek and Find, Look and Learn, and Discuss and Do.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/step-towards-green-homes-through-children/article32773912.ece
141,2020/10/05,CUSAT BTech exams hit by pandemic crisis,"Imposition of section 144 and requisition of colleges as FLTCs hits varsity planning

The imposition of section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code limiting public gatherings and use of colleges as first-line treatment centres (FLTC ) have hit the timely conduct of the BTech supplementary exams of the Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT).

The supplementary exams for the 2012 scheme were actually scheduled in March-April. The aspirants were eagerly awaiting the publication of the notification for the exams after the varsity had initiated steps to hold it. But the declaration of section 144 up to October 31 restricting the ban on assembly of more than five persons at a time had affected the plans to declare the notification for the exams, said senior varsity officials.

The authorities had sought the cooperation of the principals of nearly 24 recognised colleges (now affiliated with Technical University) in setting up exam centres for the supplementary exams. Only five principals have responded as on Monday. The facilities in colleges are now being used for the first-line treatment centres for COVID-19 patients and cannot be designated as exam centres, they said.

The students need to submit their application forms at the college in which they had pursued the BTech programme.

“We can change the exam centres as per the convenience of the students, but they have to submit the applications at the college of study itself,” an official said.

The examination wing said that they are still hopeful of conducting the exams in November-December. The varsity would be able to hold both the even and odd semester supplementary exams in this period even though a confirmation cannot be given at this point owing to the COVID-19 situation, it said.

The aspirants had pointed out that they were not able to apply for the graduate level exams and other openings without clearing the arrears. Some of them had already taken up job offers and the company authorities were asking them to submit the provisional certificate. The candidates had suggested holding the exams online in view of the pandemic situation. But the authorities cited practical and logistical hurdles for conducting the exams online as the number of students was high.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cusat-btech-exams-hit-by-pandemic-crisis/article32773909.ece
142,2020/10/05,41 persons arrested in Kerala on child pornography charges,"Covert operation exposes surge in online trafficking of child sexual abuse material.

A month-long covert online surveillance operation code-named P-Hunt_20.2 has culminated in the arrest of 41 persons from across Kerala on the charge of ""seeking, collecting, browsing and downloading"" child pornography, according to the State police.

The police also found vast caches of videos and pictures of minors stored in the mobile phones, pen drives, hard discs, tablets and laptop computers seized from the suspects.

The raids appeared to have exposed the dark underbelly of life in the time of the contagion.

Additional Director General of Police and head of the Countering Child Sexual Exploitation (CCSE) team, Manoj Abraham, told The Hindu that the confiscated content included videos and images captured furtively, mostly on mobile phones, in domestic environs during the COVID-19 period in Kerala.

The police also found child sexual abuse material (CSAM) content sourced from security cameras at homes and in flats and images and videos of children harvested from webcams. Mr Abraham said the flood of new CSAM content online also indicated a rise in child abuse in the State.

Another officer said the cases detected was merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg. He said child abuse could go unreported since children have little contact with their classmates or teachers due to the restriction on in-person schooling. Some of the CSAM was possibly from households hit by domestic violence or parental alcohol or drug addiction or impaired adult supervision.

Investigators said the stay-at-home circumstances impelled by the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in increased internet usage. A flip side of the situation was a worrying surge in internet search engine queries related to child pornography.

Investigators at the Kerala Police Cyberdome tracked and identified persons who obsessively downloaded, disseminated or traded child CSAM over multi various social media platforms.

They used a mix of surveillance software, social engineering techniques and deceptive social media identities to insinuate themselves into the clandestine child porn sharing circles.

The ""darknet"" was the platform of choice for posting, harvesting and disseminating CSAM. The police also stumbled upon WhatsApp and Instagram groups, with unusual names such as Corona Life and Gold Garden, that specialised in sharing images and videos of children. The accused persons came from varied social and economic backgrounds and different age groups.

Sreejith, IG, South Zone, Harschitta Attaluri, and IG, North Zone, Ashok Yadav, coordinated the arrests and seizures.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gh3hpu/article30240827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-porn-cybercrime-SV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/many-persons-arrested-in-kerala-on-child-pornography-charges/article32773159.ece
143,2020/10/05,Chief Minister announces launch of tunnel road project works,"The project, estimated to cost ₹658 crore, would be the third such biggest undertaking in the country.

The official project launch of the proposed Anakkampoyil-Meppadi tunnel road was held at Thiruvambadi in the district on Monday. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced the project launch through video conferencing in the presence of State Ministers and people’s representatives.

Mr. Vijayan said the tunnel road project estimated to cost ₹658 crore would be the third such biggest undertaking in the country. He said it would be completed by complying with all the existing ecological regulations.

The Chief Minister also pointed that the sub-terrain road to be constructed by the Konkan Railway Corporation Limited would reduce the traffic congestion on the hazardous Thamarassery Ghat road. “It would also be a boost for the domestic tourism sector and for the promotion of trade and commerce between Karnataka and the Malabar region”.

Referring to some of the environmental concerns raised by activists against the seven-kilometre long road project, Mr. Vijayan said the Left Democratic Front-led Government was in favour of adopting an appropriate decision which could equally address the environmental concerns and the requirement of local development. “We were not ready to succumb to unwanted controversies,” he clarified.

Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran, who presided over the event online, said the tunnel road project could be completed in three years. “The State government has already agreed to sanction any additional amount required for the timely completion of the project,” he said.

The launch event conducted by following COVID-19 protocol at Thiruvambadi was attended by the Minister for Labour and Excise T.P. Ramakrishnan, Parliament Member M.V. Shreyams Kumar, Thiruvambadi MLA George M. Thomas and Thamarassery Bishop Remigiose Inchananiyil.

It was in 2014 that a feasibility study of the innovative proposal was done by the Government to realise an alternative road to Wayanad district. In 2016, it was officially approved for further proceedings and survey works. A few months ago, the State government accorded sanction to the estimate of ₹658 crore for implementation under Kerala State Infrastructure Investment Fund Board.

Officials who prepared the preliminary estimate said the cost to complete one kilometre stretch of the proposed road alone would come around ₹150 crore considering the additional development requirements. It would also include the cost of constructing a 70-metre long bridge at Kundanthodu. The total length of the sub-terrain road would be seven kilometres.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hxvk69/article32181942.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-PINARAYIVIJAYAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chief-minister-announces-launch-of-tunnel-road-project-works/article32771442.ece

P.U. Sanoop, 26, CPI(M) branch secretary of Puthussery Colony in Chovvannur Panchayat was hacked to death on Sunday night.

He was attacked around 11.30 p.m. on Sunday night at Chittilangode near Eyyal. Three other CPI(M) workers, Vipin, Jithu, and Abhijit, who were critically injured in the attack, have been admitted to hospital.

Police found a car near Erumappetty Taluk Hospital, which was used by people involved in the attack.

The CPI(M) alleged that an armed gang of RSS-Sangh Parivar workers attacked their activists. The police are searching for an eight member gang in connection with the murder.

Sanoop and his friends were attacked while returning after arranging food, which used to be distributed at Thrissur Medical College Hospital everyday by the DYFI.

145,2020/10/05,Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital releases wrong body to family,"Mistake comes to light after body of unidentified COVID patient was cremated

A few days after a doctor and two head nurses were suspended for the alleged neglect of a patient, the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital courted yet another controversy when it released the wrong body to a family. The mistake came to light only after the body of the COVID-19-infected patient was cremated.

The issue cropped up after the death of 57-year-old native of Venniyoor, near Vizhinjam, on October 1. He had succumbed to kidney ailments for which he was undergoing treatment in the hospital for nearly 10 days. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 later. The next day, the hospital authorities handed over the body of a COVID-19-infected unidentified person, who had been brought dead to the hospital, to the Venniyoor native’s family.

His son, who had recently come from Abu Dhabi, wanted to see his father for the last time. When he raised doubts upon seeing the deceased person’s face, his relatives attributed the changed appearance to the treatment. The body was consigned to flames at Shanti Kavadom in Thycaud on Friday evening.

Body in mortuary

However, the family’s suspicion came true after the hospital realised its folly on finding his body in the mortuary. Subsequently, Government Medical College Principal Sara Varghese tasked Resident Medical Officer (RMO) Mohan Roy with conducting an inquiry. The hospital claimed to have released the body after being informed by the Vizhinjam health inspector that his son had identified the deceased. The hospital handed over the Venniyoor native’s body to his family on Sunday following which it was cremated in Shanti Kavadom by 4.30 p.m. in line with the COVID-19 protocol. The Vizhinjam police said they were yet to receive any complaint from the family of the deceased.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mch-releases-wrong-body-to-family/article32768090.ece
146,2020/10/05,Tackling children’s mental health during COVID,"‘Doctor Live’ programme will address concerns related to differently abled children

Children’s mental and physical health after being cooped up inside homes for months on end has parents increasingly worried. When it comes to differently abled children, these concerns are amplified, especially against the backdrop of rise in COVID-19 caseload in recent days.

In a first, the Samagra Shiksha, Kerala’s Payyannur block resource centre is piloting an online programme in which an entire panel of doctors will address concerns related to the differently abled children and their parents every week.

The programme ‘Doctor Live’ will see experts from various medical disciplines reply to doubts and queries live on a WhatsApp group at specific times in a week. Parents of differently abled children can text their problems or doubts to the group any time. Live questions too can be posed. T.V. Viswanathan, district programme officer, Kannur, says some differently abled children need continuous medical attention. However, in the wake of the pandemic, parents are unable to take them to hospitals or doctors fearing COVID-19 infection. Forced to manage various problems at home, they are under a lot of strain fearing the impact of the lack of medical attention on their children.

S.Y. Shooja, State Programme Officer, Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, says differently abled children are finding themselves without their usual support structures such as resource teachers, therapists, doctors, and so on. The ‘Doctor Live’ initiative will help address such physical or mental health concerns virtually in the absence of face-to-face meetings.

147,2020/10/05,Success story at Kottukal community development centre,"It has been bagging the award for the best CDS in the district since 2010

Not for nothing has the Kottukal community development society (CDS) of Kudumbashree earned a good name for itself.

The CDS which has been adjudged one of the best Kudumbashree CDSs has succeeded in making one woman of each below-the-poverty line family in Kottukal panchayat a member of the Kudumbashree, says Kottukal CDS chairperson Prasanna Kumari S.

When she took over as chairperson in January 2018, they had been bagging the award for best CDS in the district since 2010.

With her two-decade-long experience in the Kudumbashree network, Ms. Prasanna Kumari kept up the good work. She was not disappointed, and says they will bag the award for the third time on the trot in 2021 too.

With Kottukal largely an agricultural village, the CDS has formed the members into farming joint liability groups and made available to them bank loans, interest subsidy, seeds and so on, so as to retain at least 90% of farmer families in the agricultural sector.

The coastal areas too have witnessed a change. From the days when the women had no idea of what how to start a venture or the technical knowledge required to launching microenterprises such as fish processing, dry fish, fish pickle, curry powder, and even beauty parlours, things have come a long way. The coastal wards alone have 127 neighbourhood groups. All of them have been provided a revolving fund of ₹15,000, she says.

An amount of ₹5 lakh received as part of the ‘Ini Njangal Parayaam’ reality show in 2015 has been utilised for purchasing utensils and table chairs.

Twenty-one of 36 Haritha Karma Sena members have been registered as a microenterprise unit to make paper bag and cloth bags for sale. They also provide food catering services in uniform.

Besides 89 Balasabhas, the CDS has formed 42 elderly neighbourhood groups for the protection of senior citizens.

Community kitchen during the early days of the pandemic, Janakeeya Hotel, awareness programmes, medicine delivery, food for those in home quarantine in containment zones were some of the COVID-19 related activities undertaken.

The work on the Integrated Command Control Centre under the city Corporation's Smart City project will begin on Monday.

The command control centre is meant for providing the Corporation with real-time data from the ground on everything from street lights to water supply to traffic situation. Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, Mayor K.Sreekumar said that the system can function as a control room in crisis situations like floods or other natural disasters. It will also streamline the civic body's co-ordinated activities with the Police, Revenue and Health Departments.

Through the video management solution to be installed in the command control centre, constant monitoring of public spaces for traffic-related issues, accidents or other issues will be made possible. Cameras enabled with various types of sensors will be placed in different parts of the city for monitoring by the centre.

Traffic system

The traffic lighting system in the city is also set to be modernised into an adaptive system under the Smart City project. Through the traffic diversion and management system, re-routing and management of traffic will take place. For the public, the system will also help in identifying parking lots with vacant spaces in real-time and also place bookings for the same. A single payment gateway for various services will be part of the system. Tracking waste collection and disposal will also be enabled.

The command control centre will function as the nerve centre of all these diverse smart systems, spread over various departments.

Mr.Sreekumar said that the Corporation plans to step up its property tax collection by a study of the city's land data bank and identifying leakages in tax collection.

Inventory

149,2020/10/05,Bottled water from KIIDC’s Aruvikkara plant to be delayed,"The water plant is yet to obtain certification from BIS

The wait for bottled water from the Aruvikkara plant in the district is likely to take longer than expected with the Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (KIIDC) scrambling to sort out technical issues at the facility.

Established by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) at a cost of ₹16 crore, the bottled water plant is yet to obtain certification from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) which is a prerequisite for launching commercial operations.

Water quality tests conducted after KIIDC took over the facility in June this year had failed BIS tests reportedly after fungi presence was detected in the water. Another inspection by BIS is expected to be held this month. Steps have been taken at the plant to strengthen the water purification process, a senior KIIDC official said.

Commercial operations can be launched once the BIS certification is obtained and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issues its clearance. KIIDC, which markets the 'Hilly Aqua' bottled water brand, hopes to launch operations at Aruvikkara with 20-litre jars in collaboration with the Kudumbashree.

KIIDC officials said they had encountered several technical glitches at the plant following the take-over. The findings have been presented to the State government in a report.

The government decision to transfer the 7,200-litre-per-hour plant from KWA to KIIDC had kicked up a controversy with major KWA unions staunchly opposing the move.

The KWA director board had cleared the proposal on September 5 last year. The Water Resources Department had issued orders transferring the plant on a seven-year lease on February 28 this year much to the dismay of the unions.

The construction of the plant had been completed in February 2019. But it has since lain idle with the KWA failing to obtain BIS clearance. Subsequently, the government had cleared the transfer proposal reasoning that the KWA was already burdened with major water supply projects across the State. Moreover, commercial operations needed to be started at the earliest at the Aruvikkara facility since public money had already been spent on it, the government noted.

Meanwhile, KIIDC officials pointed out that the KIIDC has spent several lakhs of rupees for correcting technical problems at the facility after the take-over.

Demand

The bottled-water plant at Aruvikkara should be returned to the KWA as the KIIDC has failed to launch commercial operations, the AITUC-backed All Kerala Water Authority Employees' Union has demanded. The union plans to observe a 'Rights day' on Monday raising the demand.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wr46i7/article32768003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05TVBOTTILEDWTERPLANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bottled-water-from-kiidcs-aruvikkara-plant-to-be-delayed/article32767992.ece
150,2020/10/05,The learning game,"Gamification plays an instrumental role in helping students develop and hone their conceptual clarity

From multinational corporations to small businesses, every industry is relying on technology. The progress in AI is also a remarkable milestone. When it comes to education, many government and non-government bodies in India are coming up with new and interesting tech initiatives to enable a quality-based learning process for students. One such is gamification or gamified learning.

The term signifies an educational approach that uses games to deliver conceptual knowledge and thereby motivate and help students develop an interest in learning.

Benefits

Gamification in education helps make the learning process easy and enhances the overall outcomes. Students tend to adapt better when it comes to playing video games that enable them to learn their concepts alongside.

Enables self-learning: This helps them prepare and participate in competitive exams to build their career, and empowers them to take ownership of their learning and educational progress.

Increases attentiveness and efficiency: Such learning techniques help students to focus more on their syllabus, as it provides them with an enjoyable and interactive medium to learn. This motivates them to improve their efficiency and attentiveness.

Provides instant feedback: The gamified format gives students instant feedback after every game-cum-lesson. This enables them understand their progress and get better learning engagement through dashboards, with a real-time feedback mechanism that further helps teachers and parents in making informed decisions.

Freedom to fail and try again: Gamification enables students to try repeatedly without negative repercussions or fear of failure, so that they can hone their conceptual clarity to perfection.

Opportunity to see real-world applications: Learning becomes interesting and effective when learners can apply theory in a simulated practical setting. Gamification enables students to see the real-world applications and benefits of the subject. They get a first-hand look at the consequences of their choices within the game.

What’s in store

Gamified learning provides opportunities for competition through rewards, scores, recognition and other attributes that enhance learning outcomes. This, in turn, brings motivation to focus and achieve better results through an interactive and personalised experience.

151,2020/10/05,"Self-introspection needed to improve financial status, HC tells TNSTC","‘A pathetic situation continues in transport corporation for several years’

MADURAI

Surprised over the fact that a retired Managing Director of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Madurai Region) had to move the High Court for the settlement of pending surrender leave salary, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed that the government and the transport corporation had to introspect with respect to improving the financial situation of the corporation.

Justice R. Suresh Kumar observed that there was a need for self-introspection as the High Court on almost every day witnessed such petitions being filed, and despite the fact that several orders had been passed by the court in this regard, the situation remained unchanged.

The court was hearing the petition filed by S.V. Subbiah, who sought a direction to the TNSTC to settle the dues in the salary pending from 2009 to 2013 and also the Social Security Scheme benefits along with interest at the rate of 18%. He had retired from service in 2015.

The court said today a former MD had made a request to the present MD for his service benefits. Tomorrow, the MD, who was to decide on the request now, might have to face the same plight. This pathetic situation had continued in the transport corporation for several years.

A large number of retired employees had come to the streets to hold agitation, and it was only at that juncture, the government and the transport corporation would come forward to give solace as an interim measure to subside the agitating mood of the employees. Then, they would conveniently forget the situation.

Self-introspection was required to try to improve the financial status of the corporation so that the pathetic situation did not continue. A policy decision could be taken by the State government in this regard so that the employees were not driven to the court for relief.

After the State submitted that the surrender leave salary and the Social Security Scheme benefits of the former MD would be calculated and disbursed within three months, the court disposed of the petition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/self-introspection-needed-to-improve-financial-status-hc-tells-tnstc-madurai/article32776044.ece

154,2020/10/05,Deputy CM inaugurates ‘Amma’ mobile ration shops in Theni,"O. Panneerselvam however, refused to interact with the media after the inauguration of the shops

Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam inaugurated 75 ‘Amma’ mobile ration shops in Theni district on Monday.

Mobile ration shops were launched in Tamil Nadu recently by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who had announced that 3,501 mobile ration shops would benefit 5.37 lakh family card holders. The objective of the new facility is that wherever the residents had to travel long distances to fetch their essential commodities, the mobile ration shops would come in handy.

The mobile ration shops would visit hamlets once a month. Card holders who are unable to procure rations at that time, are free to visit the designated ration shops, officials said. In Theni district, 75 mobile shops would be functioning in various parts of the district as follows and 13,555 card holders would benefit: Theni: 11, Bodinayakannur: 7, Uthamapalayam: 8, Periakulam: 16 and Andipatti: 33 shops. Presently, the district has 517 permanent ration shops through which 4.10 lakh card holders procure essential commodities including rice, wheat and sugar.

Farm loan waived

At the function, presided over by District Collector M. Pallavi Baldev, officials from the Department of Cooperation said that farm loans to the tune of ₹85.51 crore advanced to 12,488 members in Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies until March 2016, have been waived. Those who were repaying the loans now shall also remit the principal alone, as the 7 % interest on the loans would be paid by the State government to the Societies.

The Deputy CM gave away financial assistance to 178 beneficiaries including self-help-groups to the tune of ₹3.88 crore. Theni MP O. P. Raveendranath Kumar, Cumbum MLA S. T. K. Jakkayan, Cooperative Department Joint Registrar M. Ekambaram, District Central Cooperative Bank Joint Registrar A. Jeeva and DRO K. Ramesh were among those who participated.

Deputy CM avoids media

After the inaugural function was over, when media persons approached Mr. Panneerselvam, he acknowledged them with folded hands and left the venue. Though the questions were about the functioning of the ‘Amma’ mobile ration shops, he refused to speak. Surrounded by his loyalists, he moved away to his convoy.

With the October 7 deadline for announcing the ruling AIADMK’s Chief Ministerial candidate for the 2021 elections drawing closer, Deputy Chief Minister and party coordinator O. Panneerselvam’s tweet on Monday -- “All my decisions have been in the interests of the people of Tamil Nadu and workers of the AIADMK. They will remain so hereafter too” -- created a flutter in political circles.

In his tweet Mr. Panneerselvam quoted a popular saying: “Whatever happened, happened for good! Whatever happens, happens well! Whatever will happen will happen well!”

Mr. Panneerselvam’s tweet also assumes political significance because it is the first time that he has gone on record with a message of political overtones, after the stormy meeting of the AIADMK’s executive committee a week ago. It was at the end of the executive committee meeting that it was announced that the Chief Ministerial candidate would be declared on October 7.

Since Friday, Mr. Panneerselvam has met with a number of his supporters at his home district, Theni. On Sunday, he along with Revenue Minister R. B. Udhayakumar and a few other MLAs, visited Usilampatti town to take a look at the site where the statue of P.K. Mookiah Thevar, a prominent follower of Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar and instrumental in establishing a number of educational institutions, in the area, is to be installed.

At the executive meeting, Mr. Panneerselvam had pressed for the early formation of an 11-member steering committee while Chief Minister and party co-coordinator, Edappadi K. Palaniswami did not agree to his demand. Supporters of Mr. Palaniswami had called for the immediate declaration of the party’s CM nominee.

Mr. Panneerselvam’s message is also being viewed in political circles as one that “forewarns party workers “to await a crucial decision” But, a key member of the Deputy Chief Minister’s camp said Mr. Panneerselvam has always been keen on ensuring “unity” within the party and this has been “illustrated” by the tweet too.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jcuh8o/article32770871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05OCTTH--OPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/deputy-cm-o-panneerselvams-political-tweet-creates-flutter/article32770872.ece

159,2020/10/05,Banned plastics available all over Chennai,"Tea stalls and small eateries are using plastic cups; civic body is too busy with COVID-19 to enforce ban

With the COVID-19 lockdown relaxed, single-use plastic items, banned by the State government, seem to be flooding the markets from neighbouring States. Local bodies have been too busy combating COVID-19 and have had no time to enforce the ban.

From restaurants to markets, banned plastic carry-bags, cups and straws have made a comeback. On January 1, 2019, the government banned single-use plastic items. Since then, the local bodies, especially corporations and municipalities, had conducted searches, seized these items and fined those selling them.

As enforcement was lacking, the products have gradually returned. “Yes, I have started using plastic cups,” said S. Mariappan, a tea vendor on Old Mahabalipuram Road. “When I reopened my shop after the lockdown was relaxed, customers refused to have tea in glasses, worried about COVID-19. So I was forced to switch to plastic cups,” he said. Several other tea stall owners and even those selling juices have embraced plastics. Many hotels, mainly small eateries, are using plastic cups.

On Sunday, plastic bags were found in many parts of Chennai, including in key areas like T. Nagar, Sowcarpet, Pondy Bazar, Saidapet and Koyambedu.

Vegetable vendors said consumers wanted plastic carry-bags. “One of my regular customers, who usually carries a jute bag, has been insisting that I give a plastic bag. Since the market is crowded, he is worried about bringing his own bag. Customers can throw away the plastic bags once they reach home,” said a vegetable vendor on Natesan Street.

A meat stall owner in Saidapet said that after the 2019 ban, people brought their own containers and vessels, but now they wanted chicken/mutton wrapped in plastic bags. “I managed to source the bags from shops in Pondy Bazaar and Sowcarpet,” he said.

Most shop owners using the banned products said that local bodies across the State had plenty of other work because of the pandemic, and there was no one to monitor them.

‘Pandemic is priority’

“The government’s priority is COVID-19 and not plastics,” said a trader on Ranganathan Street, one of the busiest shopping hubs in Chennai.

Asked how such huge quantities of plastic items entered the market, S. Rakkappan, president of the Tamil Nadu Plastic Manufacturers’ Association, said all factories that come under the association had stopped making the banned products. “These plastics that you see around are from the neighbouring States and Puducherry.”

Shopkeepers selling the banned items said they were sourcing them from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and regions near Mumbai.

“There are a few units around Erode that send out these goods on lorries and tempos. With COVID-19, no one has time to monitor these vehicles,” said a trader from Pondy Bazaar. He said it was not just traders, but even individual consumers were buying plastics for their daily use.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jw0fu6/article32768388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THPLASTICCITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/banned-plastics-available-all-over-city/article32768389.ece
160,2020/10/05,"At GST meet, Stalin wants CM to press for voting on compensation issue","‘CM should realise that merely writing a letter will not secure compensation’

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday urged the Tamil Nadu government to press for voting at the 42nd GST council meeting slated for Monday (October 5) to compensate the States for the loss of revenue due to the implementation of the tax regime.

“The voting should be on the Centre, which has reneged on its promise to compensate the States. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami should realise that merely writing a letter will not secure compensation,” Mr. Stalin said.

Recalling Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur’s reply to DMK member P. Wilson that Tamil Nadu’s due was ₹11,269 crore, Mr. Stalin said at a time when the State’s finances were in a bad shape, the failure of the Chief Minister to get the Constitutionally guaranteed compensation was dangerous to the financial sovereignty of State.

Objection by States

Pointing to reports that the GST meeting would discuss borrowings from the market and the extension of time for cess on compensation, Mr. Stalin said many States had objected to the Centre giving up its responsibility.

“But the Chief Minister, in his letter, has suggested borrowing by the Centre or releasing the amount from the Consolidated Fund of India to compensate for the implementation of the GST. He has no courage to tell the Centre that its decision was against the rights of the State on finances or to press for voting,” Mr. Stalin said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4utc96/article32768369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/at-gst-meet-stalin-wants-cm-to-press-for-voting-on-compensation-issue/article32768370.ece
161,2020/10/05,Nilgiris’ flora being taken over by invasive weeds,"These species have come to populate habitats of the native Strobilanthes plants

Iconic flora native to the Nilgiris, including more than 30 species of Strobilanthes, could be under threat of being displaced with the continuing advance of invasive flora such as Cestrum aurantiacum and Lantana camara, experts warn.

The mass blooming of the Strobilanthes kunthiana, known commonly as the neelakurinji, gave the Nilgiris (the blue mountains) its iconic name as the slopes were covered once in 12 years by the mass blooming of the shrub.

Recently, the blooming of the Strobilanthes foliosa has been reported in parts of the Nilgiris. What has experts worried is the prevalence of invasive species that have come to populate the habitats of the native Strobilanthes plants. While the habitat of the Strobilanthes plants in the upper Nilgiris is being eroded by the Cestrum aurantiacum, they are threatened by other invasive species like Lantana camara in the lower slopes.

V. Ramsundar, a horticulturalist working for the Horticulture Department in the Nilgiris, said the spread of exotic weeds and invasive species into habitats that until recently were populated only by native species could prove disastrous for the Nilgiris’ biodiversity. “It is well known that invasive species can smother and out-compete native plants, leading to their localised disappearance from a landscape,” Mr. Ramsundar said.

His concerns were mirrored by Pradeep A.K., a naturalist who has documented 19 species of Strobilanthes in the Nilgiris. Mr. Pradeep said invasive weeds posed a serious threat to the native flora. “Of the different species of Strobilanthes seen in the Nilgiris, each needs a specific micro-climate to survive and thrive. Any disturbance to their habitat could lead to their numbers diminishing and disappearing entirely from the landscape,” he said. Invasive species of plants were also posing a serious threat to the Strobilanthes species in Kodaikanal, he said.

Habitats wiped out

“If we look at records, we can see that in the 19th century, the Strobilanthes plants were recorded in places in the Nilgiris where they have been completely wiped out. In order to protect the remaining habitats, the areas where the plants are located should be identified and invasive plants should be removed immediately,” said Mr. Pradeep.

Dr. Tarun Chhabra, an expert in the local ecology of the Nilgiris, said there is a need for a study of the native flora and the threats they face. “That’s why I think the Western Ghats Plants Specialist Group (WGPSG), set up by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), can help ascertain the threats faced by the Nilgiris flora,” said Mr. Chhabra, a member of the WGPSG.

“There are certain wild Impatiens (balsams) species endemic to the Nilgiris and the Western Ghats that are found only in a few square kilometers in a particular valley, and are critically endangered,” said Mr. Chhabra, highlighting the rarity of certain endemic plant species in the Nilgiris.

Mr. Chhabra said better research and understanding of the Nilgiris’ native plants, as well as the landscape in which they are found and the threats they face, can help formulate more effective conservation strategies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wj2qbp/article32768347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5THNILGIRIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nilgiris-flora-being-taken-over-by-invasive-weeds/article32768348.ece
162,2020/10/05,Annoyed passengers pay toll for detained TNSTC bus,"Crew members said the management had not permitted them to pay at toll plazas

Passengers of a Villupuram-based Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus coughed up the money to pay toll after the bus was detained at the plaza near Samayapuram recently.

A video that went viral on social media platforms showed the bus, proceeding to Tiruchi from Chennai, was detained a few days ago.

The toll collector refused to open the barrier because of the non-payment of the toll amount.

As time ticked away, the passengers became restless and questioned the crew about the delay.

The crew members told them that the management had not permitted them to pay at toll plazas.

Since neither the crew nor the staff members of the toll plaza budged for over half-an-hour, the passengers came forward to bear the toll of ₹150.

The conductor collected the money and paid the toll.

Plea to Minister

In the video, one of the passengers is heard saying the Transport Minister should take note of the incident and intervene.

The video was believed to have been circulated by the trade union of the Aam Aadmi Party to highlight the problem faced by crew members of the State-owned transport corporation at the toll plazas.

S.A.N. Vaseegaran, State convener, AAP, Tamil Nadu, said it was unfortunate that the passengers had to pay the toll.

The government should take immediate steps to prevent recurrence of such incidents, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/31nnb7/article32768335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04OCTTHBUS-PASSENGERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/annoyed-passengers-pay-toll-for-detained-tnstc-bus/article32768336.ece

165,2020/10/05,Emergency care centres to come up along highways,"Emergency care centres will be established close to highways at 11 more places across the State to treat and save those injured in road accidents, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said.

Work to establish such centres is under way at Madhanur in Vellore district, Soolagiri in Krishnagiri district, Madhuranchavadi in Salem district, Madurai Kamaraj University in Madurai district and Gummidipoondi in Tiruvallur district. Steps are being taken to make them functional soon, he said in Kodumbalur on Saturday.

The centres, which are presently functioning at six locations in the State, have provided treatment to as many as 56,586 persons, the Minister said, after inaugurating an improved round-the-clock free emergency care centre on the premises of the Government Primary Health Centre at Kodumbalur.

The centre has been set up along the Madurai-Chennai National Highway at a cost of ₹1 crore. A team of four doctors and 10 nurses will be deployed there.

Mr. Vijayabaskar said the centres were being established to reduce the time taken to rush the injured to facilities for treatment. The time taken to shift the injured to the centre, from the accident spot, will be lesser compared to the time it takes to move them to a hospital. Stating that the establishment of free emergency care centres was a pioneering effort, he said that steps were being taken in Goa as well to emulate the same.

166,2020/10/05,Man rescues injured monkey,"A 28-year-old man was appreciated by the public for rescuing an injured monkey after nearly three hours of struggle in Ambur on Sunday.

Ashok Kumar, 28, from Ambur, has been rescuing snakes and other animals in the locality for over 12 years. On Sunday around 9.30 a.m., he received a call from a friend. “He informed me that an injured monkey was spotted above a building on Netaji Road, where he works, and sought my help,” Mr. Ashok said.

He rushed to the spot and found that the hands of the monkey were bleeding and it was unable to use them. “When I went near the monkey, it started running and jumping from one building to another. But I could sense it was in pain. It appeared as if the injuries were inflicted by other monkeys or it must have suffered an electrical shock,” he said.

After close to three hours, the monkey ran into a garment shop and Mr. Ashok nabbed it. “Being a Sunday, we could not get a government veterinarian. Hence, I alerted forest officials and with the help of a local veterinary doctor, we treated it,” he said.

G.D. Moorthy, forest ranger, Ambur, said that the monkey was released in a reserve forest area. “The animal bit the guard while it was being set free. It was in so much pain. At least two to three animals are being rescued everyday from Ambur. The number is more during summer,” he said.

169,2020/10/05,Hathras rape case: Kanimozhi to lead candlelight march,"Human rights have been thrown to the winds in Uttar Pradesh, says Stalin

The DMK’s women’s wing, led by secretary Kanimozhi, will take out a protest march on Monday evening to the Raj Bhavan, seeking justice for the Hathras rape victim and urging the Uttar Pradesh government to protect women, minorities and the Scheduled Tribes in the State, whose safety has come under question, DMK president M.K. Stalin said.

Mr. Stalin on Sunday said that Ms. Kanimozhi would lead the march from Rajiv Gandhi statue in Guindy to the Raj Bhavan at 5.30 p.m. on Monday. He said the Uttar Pradesh government was trying to protect the accused and was creating a situation to help them escape from law.

“The incident has created ripples not just in Uttar Pradesh, but across India. The police also stopped Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi when they were trying to meet the victim’s family. What is more atrocious is that the police manhandled Mr. Gandhi, and the visuals of him being pushed to the ground is a blot on India’s democracy. If such treatment is being meted out to Mr. Gandhi, imagine what the situation of the common man would be,” Mr. Stalin said.

He said Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should take responsibility for not providing enough security to Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Priyanka when they were allowed to go and meet the victim’s family on Saturday.

“Claiming to control the Congress cadre, the police used force against Ms. Priyanka. All this is being done to frighten the people. Democratic and human rights have been thrown to the winds. The Chief Minister should take responsibility for this, and Union Home Minister Amit Shah must give an explanation,” he said.

Cases against both the Congress leaders must be withdrawn and the privileges committee of Parliament must investigate the insult meted out to Mr. Gandhi, he said.

“Minorities, women and the Scheduled Tribes do not have security in Uttar Pradesh. The media is also understanding the situation there. The Central government has the responsibility to understand this and set the situation right,” Mr. Stalin said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/c1xg9g/article32768255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5THKANIMOZHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hathras-rape-case-kanimozhi-to-lead-candlelight-march/article32768256.ece
170,2020/10/05,Accidental death rate in Puducherry is the highest,"Puducherry leads 19 States/Union Territories which reported higher rates than the all-India average

In a mixed report card, Puducherry has topped the nation in the rate of accidental deaths while continuing to register a decline in suicides as per the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs.

According to the NCRB’s Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India 2019, the highest rate of accidental deaths per lakh of population was reported from Puducherry (72.8), followed by Chhattisgarh (68.6), Maharashtra (57.4), Haryana (54.3), Goa (51.5) and Madhya Pradesh (51.4) against the national average of 31.5 deaths per lakh of population.

Puducherry led 19 States/Union Territories which reported higher rates of ‘accidental deaths’ than the all-India average. In absolute numbers, Puducherry recorded 1,103 accidental deaths during 2019, against 1,213 the previous year.

During 2019, traffic accidents involved a total of 1,401 cases with 156 deaths, including 20 women while those who sustained injuries were 1,619 — 1,270 men and 349 women. In the road accidents category, the Union Territory recorded 1,392 cases and 147 deaths.

The other fatalities comprised sudden deaths (heart attacks): 81including six women; accidental poisoning: 24 including six women and one transgender; electrocution: 15 deaths (one woman); drowning: 51, electrocution: 15 and fall from a height: six.

Poor governance

The cases reported and percentage change in traffic accidents were 1,597 in 2018 to 1,392 in 2019 (minus 12.8).

“If a small place like Puducherry is topping the country in accidental death rates, it reflects poorly on the efficacy of governance, especially given the administrative talent available here,” said Sunaina Mandeen, member of Pondy Citizens’ Action Network.

In the case of suicides, Puducherry recorded 493 suicides (348 men;145 women) in 2019 accounting for 0.4% share of all suicides in the country with a rate of 32.5 per lakh of population. The Union Territory witnessed a minus 1.4% variation in incidence of suicides over the previous year and did not record a single event of mass/extended suicide.

Debilitating or chronic illness, family problems, bankruptcy and debt were the leading cause of suicides in Puducherry followed by much lesser degree factors such as mental illness, marital discord/dowry-related issues, failure in examinations, unemployment and unrequited love.

As a group, unemployed persons (97), students (78) and daily wagers (35) topped the list of those ending lives. All the victims belonged to the income bracket of less than ₹one lakh annually.

Suicide rate down

In a decade between 2006 and 2016, Puducherry witnessed a 33.6% reduction in suicide rate, said Rasaiya G., Associate Director of the Youth Helpline run by the Trust for Youth Leadership, an organisation with consultative status for the United Nations.

The data collated by TYCL from the Puducherry police department through Right to Information Act revealed that there was a significant reduction in the youth suicide rate.

Analysis showed that more youth suicides are recorded in rural Puducherry and that men were more prone to suicides than women, said R. Suresh Krishna, TYCL administrator.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ryl0g6/article32768237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THDEATHRATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/accidental-death-rate-in-ut-is-the-highest/article32768238.ece
171,2020/10/05,It is all work and little or no pay for ASHA workers in Tamil Nadu,"Many have not been paid for the last 3 to 4 months

Every day, Malar (name changed) has to take an 8-km walk on an unmotorable stretch to reach a tribal hamlet. This has been her area of work for almost a decade. An ASHA (accredited social-health activist) worker, Ms. Malar neither minds the daily walk nor the distance; she carries out the many health-related tasks assigned to her. But what worries her is the poor pay and lack of recognition.

For hundreds of ASHA workers like Ms. Malar, it is a long wait for better pay. Even as their fight for minimum pay continues — their performance-based incentive is ₹1,500-₹2,000 a month — many of them have not received any amount in the last three to four months. The authorities have cited “insufficient funds” as reason for the same.

There are around 3,000 ASHA workers across the State. Their work in hilly and hard-to-reach areas include conducting follow-ups with pregnant women, including getting them registered for delivery at government set-ups, immunisation of children, checks on adolescent health, health education and community sensitisation. Presently, some of them are also engaged in COVID-19-related work, such as influenza-like illness survey.

“I have been working as an ASHA worker since 2010. I cover an interior tribal village that has no motorable road or transportation. So it is a 16 km walk to and from my house every day. My job includes identifying pregnant women, bringing them to antenatal clinics, their registration, taking care of the immunisation of children below the age of five, checking for adolescent anaemia, escorting pregnant women for delivery to government facilities, even during late hours, and visiting them for 42 days in the post-natal period. We continue to carry out these works but our demands have not been fulfilled,” Ms. Malar noted.

An ASHA worker in Kanniyakumari said, “We have not received pay for the last four months. When we asked, the office of the Deputy Director of Health Services told us that there were no funds. However, we have been working non-stop. We have been demanding a fixed pay of ₹18,000 a month but the government has not even considered our plea.”

An ASHA worker and district committee member of AITUC, B. Vasanthakumari, pointed out that earlier, incentives were granted for 32 tasks. “This has been brought down to nine, and in some districts, incentives are given only for seven to eight works now. In fact, ASHA workers in Kallakurichi and Villupuram have not received their monthly pay for the last seven months,” she said.

No takers for work

Another ASHA worker in Namakkal, on condition of anonymity, said that incentives for work, such as creating awareness on family planning and providing vitamin-A supplementation, had been stopped. “We have not received pay for three months. We have to take care of our family expenses. Whatever amount we used to receive is insufficient. As a result, many young girls are unwilling to join as ASHA workers or do not stay for long in the job,” she said.

G.R. Ravindranath, general secretary, Doctors’ Association for Social Equality, said the State government should fix minimum wages for ASHA workers and make their jobs permanent. “The incentives are not sufficient. The State government should fix a minimum wage of ₹15,000 to ₹20,000. They should be given special pay for COVID-19-related work,” he said.

A Health Department official, when contacted, said he would check on the issue of non-payment of incentives.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/19og09/article31994317.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ASHAWORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/it-is-all-work-and-little-or-no-pay-for-asha-workers/article32768228.ece

173,2020/10/05,"Dalit girl set afire, battling for life","Ghastly incident took place on Sept. 18 after girl resisted rape

A minor dalit girl, aged around 13 years, is battling for life after she was set on fire allegedly by a 28-year-old married youth for resisting his rape attempt at his house in the town over a fortnight ago.

The horrific incident took place on September 18 at the accused’s house at Mustafanagar here, where the girl was working as a domestic help, sources said.

The ghastly incident sparked widespread outrage as activists of various women's organisations staged a dharna here on Monday in protest against the “rising tide of violence” against young girls.

It came to light belatedly after the failure of alleged attempts by the accused to hush up the matter by intimidating the parents of the girl through some community elders as both the accused and the victim hails from the same community, the sources said.

The minor girl, who suffered 70% burn injuries, is undergoing treatment at a private hospital, where the accused reportedly admitted her by projecting the burn wounds as accidental on September 18.

‘Poured petrol’

The traumatised girl reportedly told the officials, who visited the hospital following the outrage, that Maraiah poured petrol on her before setting her ablaze, while his mother and wife were away, on September 18.

“He caught my hand when I was about to start household chores at their house,” she recalled the harrowing moments. “He tried to whisk me away to his room even as I repeatedly pleaded with him to leave me. I managed to rush towards the main entrance of the house, he came to me a short while later carrying a petrol can. He suddenly poured petrol all over my body and set me on fire,” she recounted the horrific scene.

Wreathing in pain from burn injuries, the girl lying on the hospital bed said, “I ran towards Maraiah’s father, screaming unable to bear the pain. He immediately tore apart my burnt clothes and wrapped me in a wet cloth,” she said with fear writ large on her face. Tension prevailed at the private hospital as dozens of women activists squatted on the main road demanding harsh punishment to the accused at the earliest and also action against the private hospital management for allegedly failing to inform the matter to the authorities concerned.

Khammam Police Commissioner Tafseeq Iqbal and others visited the hospital. A magistrate recorded the statement of the victim.

When contacted, Khammam Assistant Commissioner of Police B Anjaneyulu said a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act and the relevant sections of the IPC was registered against Maraiah.

The members of the Zilla Parishad (ZP) urged Collector M. Hanumantha Rao to see that pending of bills of dumpyards, graveyards and drying platforms were cleared.

The general body meeting of the ZP held here on Monday was presided over by chairperson P. Manjushree and attended by Mr. Hanumantha Rao and others. None of the MLAs attended the meeting while Finance Minister T Harish Rao could not attend due to the scheduled virtual meeting on GST with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman.

“We are happy that the district is in the first place in completing the construction of graveyards and dumpyards in the State. Many sarpanches paid the amount from their pockets as they were promised that they will get the amount. Some sapranches even pawned their household gold jewellery to complete these works. Please see to it that their dues are paid immediately,” said the members.

Responding to their request, Mr. Hanumantha Rao said that the amount of ₹ 30 crore was yet to be released by the government and the issue was in the notice of Mr. Harish Rao.

The members expressed serious displeasure over the poor response from the medical department, stating that despite repeated calls there was no proper response from the concerned doctors. While explaining that due to additional burden on doctors and other medical staff they are unable to respond in time, the Collector directed the District Medical and Health Officer (DM&HO) and others officials to see that this is not repeated again.

Zilla Parishad vice-chairman Prabhakar and others pointed to the repeated pollution of tanks and death of several fish in tanks at Jinnaram and Gummadidala. They said that despite proper reporting from the field level there was no action from the higher authorities. The Collector has asked the Pollution Control Board (PCB) to submit the report copies to him as well.

176,2020/10/05,Minister exhorts States to ensure teaching in mother language,"Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank inaugurates the new premises of Hyderabad regional centre of Central Hindi Institute

Union Minister of Education and Central Board of Hindi Education chairman Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank has exhorted the governments of the States to take steps to ensure that teaching in mother tongue formed the basis of academic curriculum across the country.

The Centre was actively considering setting up Indian Language University so that people in different regions could learn languages of different States. “It is important to see that people of the north learn the languages of the south and those in the south know about languages of the north,” he said.

The Minister was speaking after virtually inaugurating the new campus of the Hyderabad regional centre of Central Institute of Hindi. The new building, constructed on a 1,000 sq.yds plot in the heart of the city with an estimated ₹ 5.67 crore, has library, conference hall and classrooms equipped with state-of-the-art equipment. The land for the new building of the institution was given by the State government and Mr. Pokhriyal acknowledged the government’s gesture by thanking the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.

He said the new education policy announced by the Central government would be a corner stone in developing the Indian languages and the States should cooperate in ensuring that the goals envisaged in the new education policy were achieved. He said the new education policy had preferred education in the mother tongue as it was felt that language was not just a word but the spirit which had tradition, culture and values. Steps were taken to strengthen and empower all the 22 languages listed in the eighth schedule of the Constitution and Hindi owed the important responsibility of connecting all these languages.

Hindi was a language which had eloquence and lexicon and it was probably the only language with more than nine lakh words. The language drew from its relation with the 22 languages in the country.

“Mahatma Gandhi said that the nation which does not have an official language is dumb. We shall strive to empower all the languages including Hindi that connects them,” he said. In this context, he recalled how several developed and developing countries including Germany, France, Japan, Israel and others, where education was imparted in the mother tongue, made tremendous progress in the field of research and technology. “We should know foreign languages, but not at the expense of our roots,” he averred.

The Central Institute of Hindi had a major role to play in the promotion of the language and the eight regional centres including the one in Hyderabad should take forward this on a mission mode. More than 14,000 students/teachers received training from the Hyderabad centre and they should be treated as ambassadors of the language.

Minister Ch. Malla Reddy, Central Hindi Institute director Bina Sharma and scholars from across the country participated in the e-inauguration of the new premises.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/v3f3xf/article32776084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy05Building,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/minister-exhorts-states-to-ensure-teaching-in-mother-language/article32776085.ece
177,2020/10/05,Centre told to borrow money and pay States,"TS sticks to its stand on not borrowing to meet GST shortfall at GST Council meet

The Telangana government once again made its stand clear at the Goods and Services Tax Council meeting on Monday that the Centre pay the entire GST compensation due to States on account of dismal collections this year from its own coffer.

The State government rejected both the options given by Centre to make up for unpaid GST compensation.

Option one offered States to borrow the shortfall arising out of GST implementation, estimated at ₹ 97,000 crore, to be borrowed through the issue of debt under a special window. Option two offered the States to borrow the entire compensation shortfall of ₹ 2.35 lakh crore through the issue of market debt.

Speaking at the virtual meeting, presided over by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman, Telangana Finance Minister T. Harish Rao asked the Centre to borrow the money and pay compensation to States which is their right under the GST Act.

Unpaid instalments

Mr. Rao demanded that the government immediately release to the States ₹ 30,000 crore deposited in the account of GST Council as GST compensation cess. Three instalments of money were already unpaid to States in last six months. This money was valuable to States in the current COVID situation.

Mr. Rao asked Centre not to link the lifting of cap on borrowings by States as part of Atmanirbhar package with payment of GST compensation. The entire quantum of money due to State under Integrated GST should be paid immediately.

A sum of ₹ 24,000 crore towards IGST for 2017-18 was deposited with the Consolidated Fund of India. Telangana’s share in it was ₹ 2,638 crore which should be released immediately.

Input tax credit

A release said Ms. Sitaraman committed to releasing the entire ₹ 24,000 crore to States within a week. Mr. Rao requested her to release ₹ 1,000 crore due to Telangana as input tax credit of reversed and lapsed IGST which was unpaid to States for sometime.

The release added that the meeting ended inconclusively after Telangana, West Bengal and Congress led State governments rejected the two options on GST compensation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/6kzhge/article32777012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy05Harish,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/centre-told-to-borrow-money-and-pay-states/article32776081.ece

The announcement was made by vice-president of the party P.L. Vishveshwar Rao here on Monday after a meeting of the party which was chaired by Mr. Kodandaram. It is for the first time Mr. Kodandaram will be in fray for direct election for a seat in the Legislature.

The party has also released poster and leaflets on the party’s candidature for the Graduates Constituency on the occasion. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Kodandaram said TJS was fighting for the self esteem of Telangana people irrespective of political interests as the government led by Telangana Rashtra Samithi had failed completely in protecting the self respect of the people.

He alleged that a dictatorial rule was going in Telangana as the government was trampling democratic norms and values on any given opportunity.

Mr. Kodandaram who spearheaded the movement for statehood to Telangana as the chairman of Telangana Joint Action Committee (TJAC), an apolitical platform for people’s organisations, employees’ bodies and political parties, later floated political party TJS along with like-minded persons before the last Assembly elections but it could not make much impact electorally.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/q4k0o6/article32775687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06KODANDARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kodandaram-is-tjs-candidate-for-graduates-mlc-poll/article32775491.ece

The minimum support price (MSP) for crops is not going anywhere and the NDA government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is committed to implement it with all sincerity across the country, asserted Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy on Monday.

“Wherever the market price for the agriculture produce is less, the government will intervene with MSP. Let there be no doubt about it. I appeal to the farming community not to fall prey to negative propaganda unleashed by the Opposition parties because the Modi government has provided most funds towards agriculture and allied activities,” he claimed.

Addressing a press conference held in the party office, Mr. Reddy stated that the Centre has brought forth ‘revolutionary landmark farm bills’ in Parliament and this was conforming to what almost all the other parties wanted to do to “unshackle” the farmers and allowing them to sell their produce freely without being restricted by the market committees or being “duped” by the middlemen.

Supporting middlemen

“All the parties agitating against the new Agriculture Acts are only supporting the established middlemen. No real farmer, who has understood the intent behind the new Acts, is taking part in any of the protest programmes from Punjab to Telangana as it is only meant to bring more investment into the agriculture sector,” he claimed.

The Minister questioned the Congress Party’s commitment to the farmers claiming its manifesto wanted to take up the same kind of initiatives taken up by the Modi government. “They did not get the mandate but we received an overwhelming one, so we took them up in right earnest in our quest to double the farmers’ incomes. These are especially beneficial for the small and marginal farmers constituting the majority,” he said.

The Congress-led governments never took up the Dr.Swaminathan Committee recommendations to improve the agriculture incomes and operations, he said and reeled out statistics to buttress his point about enhanced budgetary support from the NDA government from 42% to 120% in MSP for various crops from paddy to wheat, bajra, maize, ragi and so on.

‘Doubled outlay’

“Modi government had spent ₹7 lakh crore on MSP, double of what the previous Congress led UPA government did. Farmers’ loans has increased to ₹14 lakh crore from ₹4 lakh crore,” he claimed. The Opposition was welcome to come up with constructive ideas for taking up implementation of new education policy, finance bills, farmers bills or even the labour code, he appealed.

Turning his attention towards Telangana, Mr. Reddy questioned why the TRS government is not giving any bonus to the Centre’s MSP when it was being done by the neighbouring States, by ₹200 for each crop. “We have purchased more than ₹5,000 crore paddy from the procurement centres and committed to buy the entire cotton crop too,” he said.

With regard to the Apex Council meeting on sharing of Krishna River waters, the Minister wondered why it was difficult for both Telugu CMs to thrash out contentious issues when they have been meeting each other socially often in the last one year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/msp-is-here-to-stay-says-kishan-reddy/article32775084.ece
181,2020/10/05,Centre ready to part-fund free housing for poor,"Kishan Reddy lashes out at TRS government for tardy progress

Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy took on the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government for its ‘slow paced’ free two-bedroom housing programme for the poor in the twin cities and in rest of Telangana. “It is not enough to build 50,000 houses for the poor in the city as there are at least 16 lakh people waiting to own a home. There was an overwhelming vote for TRS in the last GHMC polls expecting construction of two-bedroom housing on a large-scale, but this has not happened,” he said.

The Minister was talking to the media after inspecting the ongoing construction of the housing scheme at Saichand Colony in Musheerabad where foundation stone was laid five years ago but progress has been tardy. “Free two-bedroom housing scheme was the single point upon which the TRS was swept to power and even got their own Mayor. Yet so far not a single beneficiary name has been sent to the Centre for providing requisite funds,” he charged.

Contrasting it with the Andhra Pradesh scenario, Mr. Reddy pointed out that 12 lakh houses for the poor have been taken up there out of which seven lakh houses have been completed and also handed over to the beneficiaries with Centre providing its share of financial assistance. “Prime Minister Modi has committed to provide a home to every single eligible person and it is my responsibility to get the funds from the Centre for the same if the TRS government fulfils its part of the bargain,” he said.

There were about an estimated 10 lakh people without homes in the capital and although the government was building each home at an estimated cost of ₹8 lakh, the intended beneficiaries have nearly paid half of the amount in the last five years as rent expecting the new home nearby and also were forced to face all kinds of problems during the raging COVID-19 pandemic. They were all expecting to get a house within a year of laying of the foundation stone, he claimed.

The onus was on the TRS government to resolve the legal tangles and local disputes to expedite the construction of housing for the poor. Basic amenities like power, drinking water, sewage and road connectivity should be provided at the earliest, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/4zkkpv/article32774964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06KISHANREDDY1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/centre-ready-to-part-fund-free-housing-for-poor/article32774965.ece
182,2020/10/05,"Cong. asks people not to pay LRS fee, assures to do it free in future","Party terms the scheme a bankrupt idea of State government to repay debt

Congress Legislature Party (CLP) Leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka has asked people not to pay the regularisation fee under the Land Regularisation Scheme (LRS) unveiled by the State government recently even if they have applied for it and assured that the Congress would implement the scheme without any fee once it returns to power in the next elections.

“It’s one of the bankrupt ideas of the State government to fill its empty coffers and to repay huge debt, about ₹3 lakh crore made during the last six years. It has run out of all ideas to improve the State’s economy and has resorted to collect as much money as possible from people through direct and indirect taxes, including the LRS regularisation fee,” Mr. Vikramarka said addrressing a press conference here on Monday.

The LRS scheme was aimed at burdening the people embattled by the economic crisis induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the CLP Leader said adding that the Congress government that would be formed after the next elections would cancel the regularisation fee. “There’s no meaning in getting the land already registered one more time through LRS scheme. It’s meant only to mobilise funds for the government,” Mr. Vikramarka noted.

Comparing the huge LRS fee structure to ‘Bhoomi Sisthu’ (land cess) collected by the Nizam’s Government in the past, the Congress leader said many a land owner would surrender their lands to the government unable to pay huge cess which they could not even earn from a bumper harvest. He accused the State government of planning to bring back the bonded labour system through LRS as was done by the Nizam’s Government in the past by turning the farmers into bonded labourers to ‘Jamindars’ (landowners-government) in lieu of the land cess dues.

The CLP Leader also cautioned people against more such taxes from the government in the coming days to repay the debt that was expected double to over ₹6 lakh crore in the next three years with the help of relaxations given for borrowings by amending the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management norms.

Meanwhile, in another media interaction Congress MP from Bhongir Komatireddy Venkat Reddy said that he had already filed a public interest litigation in the High Court to stop LRS and the Congress party would not hesitate even to approach the Supreme Court in the matter and for getting justice to the poor. He alleged that the TRS government was planning to mobilise about ₹3 lakh crore through the scheme, including ₹1 lakh crore in Rangareddy district itself.

Mr. Venkat Reddy also asked people not to pay the regularisation fee even if they had applied for it as the Congress would do it for free when it would form the government in the next elections. Congress legislator from Sangareddy T. Jayaprakash Reddy also criticised the government on LRS.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cong-asks-people-not-to-pay-lrs-fee-assures-to-do-it-free-in-future/article32774919.ece
183,2020/10/05,"Congress, TRS yet to officially name candidate for Dubbak","Congress leaders in talks with Srinivas Reddy

For the reasons best known to them, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and the main opposition Congress parties are yet to make an official announcement of their candidate for Dubbak bye-election, scheduled for November 3.

As on Monday morning, only the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced its candidate — M. Raghunandan Rao, who had unsuccessfully contested the election twice in the past.

The TRS has indicated that the party would allot the ticket to the family members of sitting MLA S. Ramalinga Reddy, who passed away in August. The TRS leadership had said that the party ticket will be given to Ms, Sujatha, wife of Ramalinga Reddy. This was also made clear to those aspiring for party nomination in this election. However, party has not made any official announcement so far in this regard.

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao has already started the election campaign without naming the candidate and has been asking people to vote for the party saying that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has been focusing on welfare and development. The ruling party has also been focusing on oustees of Mallannasagar. On their part, oustees from villages that are getting submerged by the irrigation projects have been joining the party in the presence of Mr. Harish Rao and Lok Sabha member K. Prabhakar Reddy.

Coming to the Congress party, the party was unable to find a suitable candidate to take on the ruling party. Initially, the name of Gajwel former MLA T. Narsa Reddy was floated, but it was kept on hold. Since then the party has been trying to lure Cheruku Srinivas Reddy, son of former minister late Cheruku Muthyam Reddy, who had a good hold on the constituency.

According to sources, Congress State affairs in-charge Manickam Tagore and former deputy chief minister Damodar Rajanarasimha held discussions with Mr. Srinivas Reddy in this regard and offered to give him the party nomination. He has reportedly told the Congress leaders that he would take a decision on Tuesday after consulting his supporters. The Congress, in all probability will make an official announcement on Tuesday.

“As the TRS doors were almost closed for elections, the joining of Srinivas Reddy will be a win-win for both Congress and him. A decision will be made tomorrow and it is likely to be only a formality,” said a source close to these developments.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-trs-yet-to-officially-name-candidate-for-dubbak/article32774866.ece
184,2020/10/05,CPI demands judicial probe into Nayeem’s case,"The Communist Party of India State Committee has demanded that the government order a judicial inquiry into the killing of gangster Nayeem to bring out the facts relating to the case. CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy said the clean shit given by the Special Investigation Team to 25 police officials named in the case is tantamount to diluting the entire episode. He wondered why the government is reluctant in making public the contents of the gangster’s diary. Hundreds of people suffered at his hands and Nayeem was involved in forcible acquisition of lands, besides in rape cases, he said.

The government had constituted a special investigation team to inquire into the incident. But four years after the constitution of the SIT, there is no progress in the case. The government should therefore order a judicial inquiry into the case for bringing out the facts pertaining to the case. This would also help in instilling confidence among the victims who suffered at the hands of Nayeem, he said.

In a letter addressed to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, Mr. Venkat Reddy expressed concern over the rampant encroachment of government, Inam and endowments lands in Jogulamba-Gadwal district by vested interests. People who lost their lands because of the encroachments are looking at the government for restoration of their rights. Similar complaints were also being registered from different parts of the State and the government should take care to ensure that the encroached lands are protected and the rights of genuine owners restored, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cpi-demands-judicial-probe-into-nayeems-case/article32767690.ece
185,2020/10/05,TRS rebuts BJP criticism on the issue of river waters,"BJP leaders ignorant of facts, says Vinod Kumar

Rebutting the criticism of BJP that the State government failed to resolve river water disputes with Andhra Pradesh, senior TRS leader and Planning Board vice-chairman B. Vinod Kumar asserted that the onus in this regard is squarely on the Central government.

He told media persons here on Sunday that the issue was something that could not be settled between States because Section 3 of the Inter-State Water Disputes Act mandated the Centre to constitute a tribunal for the purpose.

In the last six years, the State government had approached the Centre several times to set up the tribunal for a permanent solution to water disputes between the riparian States of Telangana, AP, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had written letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti and her successor Nitin Gadkari. Within six weeks of Telangana formation, Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao had also written a letter in this regard to Union Water Resources Minister. A notice to the Secretary of Ministry was also given by Principal Secretary of Irrigation S.K. Joshi the same day, he said.

The TRS mounted pressure on Ms. Uma Bharti and Mr. Gadkari to resolve the water disputes in the last Parliament also. But, the MPs of Karnataka and Maharashtra set up obstacles in the House when Ms. Bharti made an effort to address the issue. The State government invoked a provision of Inter-State Water Disputes Act to move the Supreme Court if the Centre did not respond for one year. Yet, there was no response from Centre, he said.

Mr. Vinod Kumar said it is unfortunate that Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy and BJP State president Bandi Sanjay Kumar targeted the State government without knowledge about the efforts put in by the State government.

Mr. Reddy made irresponsible remark that the Central government would mediate in talks between Telangana and AP Chief Ministers to find the solution. Mr. Sanjay Kumar towed Mr. Reddy's line without a clue about the whole episode.

The latter's comment that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao woke up to the issue and wrote a letter to Union Water Resources Minister only now speaks about his ignorance. If Mr. Reddy, Mr. Sanjay Kumar and two other BJP MPs who targeted the State government should use their offices to ensure that the Centre hands over redistribution of Krishna water between Telangana and AP to the present Brijesh Kumar tribunal, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/1ccn93/article32767636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY05BVINODKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-rebuts-bjp-criticism-on-the-issue-of-river-waters/article32767637.ece
186,2020/10/05,Meet this Hyderabad artist who has initiated an Art Yagnam,"Manohar Chiluveru is on a 36-day fundraiser. The project aims to create 100 works, even if it means painting for 24 hours at a stretch

Hyderabad-based artist Manohar Chiluveru, known for his paintings, sculptures and interactive public art installations, has embarked on a project titled Art Yagnam.

The 36-day project began on September 30, and Manohar will be creating a bank of more than 100 artworks (which will be made available on artyagnam.com). He equates it to a kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a virtual exhibition and other collaborative initiatives to help fine art practitioners.

“Yagnam refers to prayer and art is my way of doing it,” says Manohar, who has been painting at Marri Channa Reddy Human Resource Development Institute of Telangana in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad. At the end of the project, the art bank will have paintings, sculptures and digital art.

A host of activities will come up through the month to engage art patrons online and offline.

Later this week, Manohar plans to paint for 24 hours at a stretch: “An artist has the freedom to work at his pace in a studio; you can pause and correct if needed. Painting is a meditative process and when you do it at a stretch, you are guided by your intuition and spontaneity, without preconceived thoughts. I will be working on both figurative and abstract paintings in those 24 hours,” he says.

Manohar was in Milan, Italy, in February 2020 for his travel art project, Odyssey. He returned to India in March before the travel restrictions came into effect. He observed how the pandemic brought the world to its knees, forcing everyone to halt and reassess their priorities.

For the bigger picture

A painting by Manohar Chiluveru

Like several others in his fraternity, Manohar responded to the lockdown by working on a series. He thought of Art Yagnam as a meditative, creative process through which he can metaphorically stand in solidarity with COVID-19 frontline workers; raise funds for NGOs and help other fine art practitioners hit by the pandemic.

The list of beneficiaries hasn’t been finalised: “I am in talks with organisations. I wanted to begin the art project so that a bank of paintings can be created. Even if I want to help curate a virtual exhibition to help other artists, I need initial capital. The best way to raise funds is by creating new artworks and selling them,” he explains.

With the funds he raises through Art Yagnam, Manohar plans to organise an international virtual exhibition featuring the work of fine art practitioners, musicians, dancers and those in the literary field. “We will be finalising a website outlining the details of this exhibition soon,” says Manohar.

Art Yagnam will also support publication of a book, Earth Reboots, by Netherlands-based Kriya Art Foundation.

The book will document why art and creative expressions matter during a pandemic, and will involve contributions from 360 artists and writers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/97ife7/article32773143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4-Art-yagnam,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/hyderabad-artist-manohar-chiluverus-month-long-art-yagnam/article32773146.ece
187,2020/10/05,"61% rural consumers in Rajasthan unaware of trans fat hazard, says survey","‘Consumption up from pre-lockdown level in Rajasthan’

Despite an increase in cardiovascular diseases in the rural areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, 61% of consumers in the villages in Rajasthan are unaware of the hazards of trans fats, which are responsible for heart ailments by raising the cholesterol levels. Very few consumers know about the sources of trans fats, according to a survey.

The sample survey, conducted by the Consumer Unity and Trust Society (CUTS)-International in 12 districts of the State recently, has found that the consumption of industrially produced partially hydrogenated vegetable oils had increased by 19% from its pre-lockdown level in the rural areas.

CUTS-International Director George Cheriyan said here on Monday that the survey was taken up in the backdrop of the release of World Health Organisation’s second progress report on global trans fat elimination, which had reminded India of its commitment to eliminate trans fats from food supply by 2022.

In the urban areas, 46% of the consumers were found unaware of the health harms associated with trans fats, though 21% of them had heard the term. The awareness level was a little higher when the correlation of trans fats was made with ‘Dalda’, which is a brand name of vansapati ghee, but not much of the consumers were aware of the margarine and bakery shortenings.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/swrrdg/article25647051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06KI-CHIPS-3G06KI-CHIPS-3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/61-rural-consumers-unaware-of-trans-fat-hazard-says-survey/article32776676.ece

189,2020/10/05,"China realised PM has weakened India, says Rahul at Punjab rally","My government will take all steps to counter the farm legislations: Amarinder

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday said the Chinese had dared to enter India and kill soldiers because the BJP-led Union government had weakened the nation with its ‘anti-national’ policies and actions, of which the agriculture sector laws were the latest example.

“China had realised that Modi had weakened India, and had taken advantage of this to take control of 1,200 km of our land,” Mr. Gandhi told a gathering at Samana in Patiala, on the second day of his three-day ‘tractor rally’ — Kheti Bachao Yatra — in Punjab.

“The Prime Minister had broken the backbone of the country, whose economic growth had plummeted from 9% under Dr. Manmohan Singh to -24%. India was going backward, which the Chinese had seen. Why else would they dare to enter our territory? How could they kill 20 of our soldiers, who were on our side of the LAC, if they did not enter India, as Modi claims?” he stated.

Farmers, he said, should understand the dangerous designs of the National Democratic Alliance government as part of a deliberate and malicious agenda to destroy their lives to promote the interests of a handful of industrialists.

Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh said his government would pass in the Assembly whatever resolution or bill needed to counter the Central Bills that would have a dangerous impact on the nation. “These laws will result in closure of the ‘mandis’. My government could not let the Union government do that. We will take all steps, including a Vidhan Sabha session, to counter the new legislations, and challenge them in the Supreme Court,” he added.

‘Rahul visit a sham’

Some parties, including the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), termed Mr. Gandhi’s visit a sham in a bid to gain political mileage.

AAP’s State unit general secretary Harchand Singh Bursat said the Congress was enacting a drama to torpedo the ongoing farmers’ struggle by holding Mr. Gandhi’s rallies in the State.

A Puri-based outfit on Monday lodged a complaint against Odisha School and Mass Education Minister Samir Ranjan Dash and BJD MLA Umakant Samantray for allegedly participating in a funeral procession at Puri despite testing positive for COVID-19.

Mr. Dash and Mr. Samantray were among BJD leaders who attended the last rites of former Minister Pradeep Maharathy who died on Sunday.

“Despite testing positive, both the Minister and the MLA participated in the procession. Their presence could be a source of COVID spread. Action should be taken against the two leaders for violation of COVID protocol,” Priyadarshan Patnaik, Convener of the Jagannath Sena, said after lodging the complaint at the Seabeach police station.

“While Swargadwar, the holy cremation ground for Hindus in Odisha, was prohibited for last rites by the Puri district administration in the wake of pandemic, the same prohibition was not followed in the event of demise of former Ministers,” Mr. Patnaik said. Top Puri district officials were also present around the cremation ground on Sunday.

Surge in cases

While both Bhubaneswar and Puri had seen surge in COVID cases in recent weeks, thousands of followers of the departed leaders were allowed to participate in funeral processions taken out in Bhubaneswar, Pipili and Puri. The instruction of maintaining social distancing and wearing masks had gone for a toss in the presence of both the Bhubaneswar and Puri police.

“We have received a complaint with regard to violation of COVID protocol. A station diary has been registered. We are investigating,” said Puri Superintendent of Police Akhileshvar Singh.

191,2020/10/05,"With LJP’s solo act, BJP likely to gain in Bihar","Chirag Paswan’s move to fight separately may help BJP emerge as the single largest party in Bihar.

These are strange days in Bihar politics — the BJP is ostensibly going into polls with the ally Janata Dal (United), openly committed to getting a JD(U) Chief Minister back in the chair, while its ally, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) is fighting Assembly polls on its own, in order to ensure that the BJP occupies the chief minister’s chair.

This extraordinary turn of events has happened because of LJP leader Chirag Paswan’s decision to go it alone in these polls, but, at the same time vowing only to put up candidates in seats where the JD(U) is the NDA party in fray, while not doing so in BJP seats. Both Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar and the BJP have maintained silence since Sunday, when the decision was announced by Mr. Paswan, but analysts say it clearly points to the BJP’s firm bid, for the first time since 1995, to capture the Big Brother status vis-à-vis Bihar in the NDA.

Bihar Assembly elections | Mahagathbandhan seals seat-sharing deal

The BJP has traditionally deferred to Mr. Kumar and the JD(U) in the past when it came to Assembly polls, in terms of seats fought and the claim over the top job. This despite many leaders within the BJP consistently having questioned the party’s deference to the JD(U) despite the BJP having a better strike rate in all the polls, and being dominant in the Lok Sabha numbers. Coalition dharma was however observed, some would say more than sincerely. Then came the breach between the BJP and the JD(U) in 2013, when Mr. Nitish Kumar walked out of the NDA refusing to accept the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He forged a seemingly impossible alliance with the Lalu Prasad-led Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) sweeping the 2015 Assembly polls and forming a government in the State.

Many lessons

The BJP has learnt many lessons from the 2015 defeat, one, that people vote differently in State and national elections, even if your leader has immense popularity, and secondly, in a polity run by caste arithmetic, the JD(U) was an important ally to help undercut a total Upper Caste - Backward Caste polarisation.

Bihar Assembly election | LJP to go it alone, but backs Narendra Modi

The return of the JD(U) in 2017 to the NDA fold was therefore eagerly worked for and the two parties, the BJP and the JD(U) went into the Lok Sabha polls as equal partners. The BJP wanted this new equality in Bihar NDA to extend to Assembly seats. This was resisted by the JD(U), but the party gave in, agreeing to fight 122 seats to the BJP’s 121, with the understanding that the LJP would be accommodated by the BJP from its share of seats.

This is when things get interesting. Several surveys and the BJP’s own assessment through the COVID-19 lockdown period with its exodus of migrants from other States returning home to Bihar, in many cases on foot, as well as the handling of other governance related issues made it plain to the BJP that Mr. Kumar was at the nadir of his popularity, while Prime Minister Modi retained his appeal. The lessons of 2015 were also clear however, nothing must be done to make it seem as though the BJP was an upper caste outfit unable to keep a partner who could bring in backward caste votes.

Mr. Chirag Paswan’s move to fight separately, and only put up candidates against the JD(U) may help BJP, now fight more seats than ever before in Bihar, emerge as the single largest party and lay claim to the chief minister’s chair. A consequence that encourages the feeling that Mr. Paswan is doing all this at the behest of the BJP.

The BJP has had, even in the elections it lost in Bihar, an excellent strike rate on seats. And even if Mr. Paswan doesn’t win too many seats, but manages to make sure the JD(U) loses out on some, his key result area would have been delivered.

Just how this rather forked tongue policy and campaign will play out among the State’s very politically astute voters is another matter. For now though, what till two months ago looked like a one sided poll, however, is suddenly split wide open.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rsja49/article32776282.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6TH-CHIRAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/analysts-see-bjps-bid-to-gain-big-brother-status/article32776283.ece
192,2020/10/05,Restart talks at PM level without preconditions in third country: Muivah,"Letter written to Narendra Modi seven months ago released on Monday for “accountability to the Nagas”

The Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland or NSCN (IM) wants its peace talks to be restarted at the level of the Prime Minister without any precondition and in a third country.

These were the conditions the outfit, which now prefers to be called National Socialist Council of Nagalim, had set before declaring a ceasefire with the armed forces in mid-1997. The first few rounds of talks were held abroad.

Thingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the NSCN (IM) and a key negotiator in the peace process, had acquainted Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the outfit’s desire in a letter seven months ago. His group released the letter to the media on Monday for the sake of “accountability to the Nagas” and to inform them about the delay because of the lack of response from the office of the “Indian Prime Minister”.

Mr. Muivah is the Ato Kilonser, meaning Prime Minister, in the ‘government’ run by the NSCN (IM). A PM-level dialogue means talks between him and Mr. Modi.

“On the official invitation of the GoI [government of India], we first arrived in India in 2002 and after our subsequent visits, we have since 2010 patiently stayed in India to conclude an acceptable and honourable political settlement. As mentioned, several rounds of talks with the Prime Ministers of India and the representatives of the GoI have already been completed and the unique outcome was the signing of the Framework Agreement (FA) on August 3, 2015...

“However, in the given circumstances and to save the political dialogue, the talks should resume at the PM level without pre-condition and outside India. And if our stay in India is no more welcome, all necessary arrangements must be made for us to leave India and the political talks be resumed in a third country,” the letter said.

Stating that most of the important issues, except for the Naga flag and constitution, have been resolved, Mr. Muivah brought to Mr. Modi’s notice “some matters of serious concern” regarding the activities of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the National Investigation Agency and the Assam Rifles.

“As you are well aware, 22 years of political negotiation had started at the PM’s level without pre-condition and outside India. We had come to India on the invitation of the Gol. However, we are totally shocked and surprised that even after more than two decades of political negotiation, the MHA and its agencies have become obnoxious,” Mr. Muivah wrote.

He said it was “shocking and surprising” that the Centre has started branding the NSCN (IM) members as ‘terrorists’ with impunity and arresting them through its agencies.

“The activities of the MHA are deliberate and calculated policies of the GoI to downgrade the political negotiation to India’s internal law and order issue. The Nagas are observing a repeat of the militarisation and a consciously carried out state terrorism in the Naga areas and against the Naga people through a show of force, arrest and allegation against NSCN members for terror funding, imposing check gates, frequent raids. The design and intent of the MHA and its agencies are unjustifiable and a serious provocation that goes against the principle and spirit of the political negotiation and the FA,” Mr. Muivah wrote.

The NSCN (IM) leader was also critical of the ‘activities’ of PMO’s representative and Nagaland Governor R.N.

193,2020/10/05,"Day after LJP decides to go solo, its MP’s son joins RJD","Khagria MP Mehboob Ali Kaiser’s son Yusuf Kaiser is likely to contest on RJD ticket from Simri Bakhtiarpur

A day after Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) announced its decision to go it alone in Bihar Assembly polls, its leader and Khagria MP Mehboob Ali Kaiser’s son Yusuf Kaiser joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and is likely to contest on their ticket from the Simri Bakhtiarpur constituency in Saharsa district.

Mr. Kaiser is one of the six members that party has in the Lok Sabha.

The Simri Bakhtiarpur constituency was represented by Mr. Mehboob Kaiser’s father, Choudhary Mohammad Salahiddin, who was with the Congress five times. Mr. Mehboob Kaiser had represented it thrice again on the Congress ticket. He joined the LJP in 2014 after he was denied ticket by the Congress from the Khagaria Lok Sabha seat. He won in 2014 and 2019 general elections from Khagaria.

Sources said Mr. Yusuf Kaiser was not confident of a victory from Simri Bakhtiarpur as a LJP candidate. Since 2010, the JD(U) has won it twice and the RJD won it in 2019 bypolls.

At the LJP Parliamentary Board meeting held on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Mehboob Kaiser backed party president Chirag Paswan’s decision to contest alone but expressed reservations on the decision, sources said.

‘Pressure from constituency’

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Mehboob Kaiser said he had dissuaded his son from joining the RJD and he remained completely committed to the LJP. He son joined the RJD because of pressure from the constituency.

“As far as I am concerned, I am with the party with heart and soul. Whatever inputs I have, may be I don’t have inputs that Chirag ji has, but I see it as an oxymoron to say that we are with the BJP but against the JD(U). Having said that I would say that Chirag ji has taken a well thought-out decision and once it has been taken, I support his and the party’s stand”, he added.

On Sunday, after the meeting of the Parliamentary Board, citing ideological differences with the JD(U), the LJP announced its decision to go it alone in the Assembly elections. The LJP will not contest against the BJP but will fight against the JD(U). The idea is to mop up anti-JD(U) votes and shake off the anti-incumbency against three-term Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. The Board voted for supporting a BJP-LJP government sans the JD(U).",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/day-after-ljp-decides-to-go-solo-its-mps-son-joins-rjd/article32775452.ece
194,2020/10/05,“My son framed to save those behind civilian killings in Shopian”,"We were made to sign on blank pages, says arrested youth’s family

The family of one of the two persons arrested in the Shopian ‘fake’ encounter on Monday claimed their son “was being framed by the security forces and the family was made to sign on blank pages”.

“The Army picked up my son, Tabish Nazir, on August 12. Later, at the District Police Line, Shopian, a DSP, Wajahat Ahmed, tore our missing complaint. Instead I was asked to sign on a blank paper,” Nazir Ahmed Malik, father of Nazir, a farmer by profession, said.

Mr. Malik, who held a protest in Srinagar on Monday, said the police officer warned that “if they had not signed the blank his son would have been branded as a militant”.

“Now our son is being linked to the July 18 Shopian encounter. It’s said he gave information to the Army [about the presence of three militants]. It is a baseless charge,” Mr. Malik said.

Speaking during the protest, Mr. Nazir’s mother also claimed that “her son is being framed”.

“My son is being deliberately linked with the Shopian encounter to save those who killed three innocent labourers [from Rajouri],” she said.

Mr. Nazir is from Shopian and lives near the Army camp that carried out the operation on July 18. Three persons, described as three unidentified militants after the encounter, turned out to be three missing youth from Rajouri.

Mr. Nazir, along with another arrested person Fayaz Ahmad, a special police officer from Poonch who worked with a police officer in Srinagar, was arrested, questioned and produced before the local court on September 30 for judicial remand.

A police officer said they were being questioned “for their role in the encounter”.

Police sources said at least three locals are under scanner for their role in passing on any information about the presence of militants to the Army on July 17, which led to the encounter.

However, the local police’s role is also under the scanner for mentioning recoveries, including arms and ammunition, after the encounter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wv2iqp/article32775129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHOPIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/my-son-framed-to-save-those-behind-civilian-killings-in-shopian/article32775130.ece
195,2020/10/05,Ink thrown at AAP MP Sanjay Singh in Hathras,"FIRs filed against Bhim Army and RLD workers

The Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh came under an “ink attack” on Monday outside Boolagarhi village in Hathras when he, along with a party delegation, was returning after meeting relatives of the victim who died after a brutal assault on September 29.

Mr. Singh and party MLA Rakhi Birlan were addressing the media when a youth identified as Deepak Sharma sprayed ink on them shouting, “brokers of PFI, go back.”

The Popular Front of India (PFI) is an Islamic fundamentalist organisation. Mr. Sharma is believed to be a member of the Rashtriya Swabhiman Dal.

Demanding justice and security for the family, Mr. Singh said the government seemed to be protecting the perpetrators of the crime. He described the CBI probe “as nothing but an eyewash.” The statement of the victim should be considered as her dying declaration. “It is enough to nail the accused,” he said.

FIRs filed

A day after Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Azad visited the family of the woman who was brutally assaulted allegedly by four upper caste men, the Hathras Police lodged an FIR against him for violating Section 144. Around 400 workers of the Bhim Army have also been booked under Sections 147 (rioting), 341 (wrongful restraint), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection), 270 and 188 of the IPC and section 3 of the Epidemic Act, 1897

An FIR, under similar sections of the IPC, has also been registered against unidentified workers of the Rashtriya Lok Dal. Police had lathi-charged RLD workers on Sunday after they tried to break the barricade outside the Boolagarhi village.

RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary, who was addressing a group of media persons, was saved by the workers who formed a shield around him. Mr. Chaudhary charged the police with being insensitive to the anguish that the incident has caused to the common people. On Monday, the RLD workers protested outside the village against the lathi charge on their leader. Similar protests were seen in different parts of the State, including Lucknow. A panchayat of jats was held in neighbouring Sadabad, an RLD stronghold, where the community expressed its anguish.

On the demand for security for the family by different delegations, Hathras SP Vineet Jaiswal told reporters that adequate security was already being provided and a section and a half of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) has been camping in the village. “One DSP rank officer, three SHOs and 15 constables have also been posted to maintain law and order. One sub-inspector and one constable have been sanctioned to be with the brother of the victim round the clock. Two woman sub-inspectors and six woman constables have been posted to guard the women in the family.” He said the security arrangement was being constantly reviewed by higher officials.

On Monday, he said, the SIT members visited the village again. “The local intelligence units have been activated to find out who tried to vitiate the social atmosphere in the area. “Nobody will be allowed to violate law and order,” he said.

MP denies charge

Meanwhile, Hathras MP Rajvir Diler denied on Monday that he went to meet the accused in the Hathras case in Aligarh jail on Sunday. Local media reports had questioned his visit to the jail, as images of him outside the jail went viral on Monday

Mr. Diler has been facing the ire of both the Valmikis and the upper castes after the incident. While the Valmikis allege the MP had not been able to safeguard the interests of his own community, relatives of the accused say the MP’s daughter put out the names of the four accused on social media even before the police named them.

Mr. Diler clarified that he had asked the Chief Minister for a CBI inquiry and that he didn’t go to meet the accused inside the jail. “I went to meet the Aligarh SSP for some urgent work, but when I reached there, I was told that the SSP has tested COVID positive and was under quarantine. When I was returning, some party workers stopped me in front of the jail. Meanwhile, the jailer came out and requested that I have a cup of tea with him. I also wanted to talk to him regarding reducing the quantum of punishment of an aged inmate. It is baseless to associate me with the case. I didn’t go to the jail to meet the accused or anybody. I didn’t even think about it,” he said.

It was an attempt to spoil his image. “The CBI inquiry will reveal who is guilty and who is not,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qz04mr/article32367786.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SanjaySinghAAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ink-thrown-at-aap-mp-sanjay-singh-in-hathras/article32774930.ece

The Congress on Monday demanded a judicial inquiry into the Hathras gangrape incident and the immediate removal of the District Magistrate (DM) Praveen Kumar Laxkar, whom the victim’s family has accused of misbehaviour.

“First of all Yogi Adityanathji’s government must immediately dismiss the DM, who is on record, on a video threatening the family. He should not be given any other posting till it is thoroughly investigated at whose behest the DM went to the family and threatened them in the manner that he did,” All India Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev said at a press conference.

“Secondly, the family of the victim is also demanding a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court... It is shocking that an Special Investigation Team (SIT) was set up after 14 days and after the media and Opposition leaders, specifically Priyanka Gandhi-ji and Rahul Gandhi-ji met the victim’s family in Hathras, they ordered a CBI inquiry as damage control,” Ms. Dev said.

Social media outreach

The party also released a 9-minute video “Hathras: Fight for Justice” on the visit by Congress leaders to the victim’s family on Mr. Gandhi’s Facebook page and YouTube channel.

In the video, Mr. Gandhi is seen assuring family members that “none can remove [you]... because it is your house, your land. If they try to do so, I will be here”.

197,2020/10/05,RJD MP flags extortion calls from mystery number,"Parties begin ticket distribution for first phase of Assembly poll.

The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Monday sought a probe into calls to political leaders in the State from a BSNL number with the caller allegedly asking for money.

“Several leaders are regularly getting calls from a telephone number 0612-22117222 for money…this telephone number was, earlier, installed at party leader and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi’s official residence but it was disconnected in 2016,” said RJD leader and Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha.

Addressing the media at the party headquarters in Patna, Mr. Jha said enquiries with state-run telecom provider Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) found that the number had been allotted to the State Forest Department in 2018 but was disconnected on March 18, 2019.

When The Hindu called the number, an error message was received, saying “please check your number and try again”. BSNL officials refused to make an official comment on the present status of the telephone number.

“We’ve asked BSNL for complete details of this phone number,” said Mr Jha.

“Several leaders are getting phone calls on various dates from this number asking for ₹20 lakh, ₹30 lakh and ₹50 lakh…we ask the government who is making such calls and who this number has been assigned to,” the RJD leader said.

“Such nefarious design would not have been possible without the consent of those who are in power in the State…it is a complete criminal act and the government must probe this to find out who are the people behind this to implicate our leader Tejashwi Yadav,” he added.

He also said the ruling JD(U) is under threat of imminent defeat in the upcoming Assembly poll.

“On November 10 (when the election results are due) the face at 1, Anne Marg (Bihar CM’s official residence) will be changed and they must have become desperate and threatened,” he alleged.

Asked about an FIR lodged against party leaders Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap and others in the murder of a Dalit leader in Purnia district, Mr. Jha said, “We’re waiting for the summons”.

“The government is yours (Nitish Kumar)…your police…then why to wait for any investigation into the case? But, you should not influence the probe,” he said.

“Headlines management, of which Nitish Kumar is said to be an expert, should also not be done in the investigation…hang Tejashwi Yadav if he is guilty but don’t influence the probe,” the RJD leader said.

Meanwhile, amid confusion between NDA partners BJP and JD(U) over seat sharing, the latter began issuing party ticket on Monday to candidates for the first phase of elections.

Over a dozen JD(U) MLAs and leaders were seen entering Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s official residence and emerging with party ticket.

Similarly, RJD leaders and sitting MLAs were seen entering 10, Circular Road, the official residence of party leader and former CM Rabri Devi and returning with a party ticket to contest the poll.

The three Left parties CPI, CPI (M) and CPI(Marxist-Leninist) too distributed their party ticket among candidates.

In the Opposition mahagathbandhan or Grand Alliance, the CPI is contesting 6 seats, the CPI(M) four and CPI(ML) 19 seats while, the two major partners RJD and Congress party are contesting 144 and 70 seats respectively for the 243-member Assembly.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hbpp8e/article32759625.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANOJJHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rjd-mp-flags-extortion-calls-from-mystery-number/article32774334.ece

The LJP’s tough posture against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) has put the NDA in a difficult situation in the matter of allocation of seats.

“I know I am standing against powerful people, but at no cost will I allow ‘Bihar First, Bihari First’ thought of the party to diminish and will not accept defeat in any situation,” Mr. Paswan wrote in his one-page open letter.

“The decision the party has taken is not to rule Bihar but to take pride in it.”

The LJP leader recalled his ailing father in the letter. “Papa always used to tell me, don’t be afraid to walk alone. If your means and motives are right, people will come to you.”

“This [poll time] is a crucial moment for history of Bihar — this is a question of life and death of 12- crore people of Bihar as we don’t have time now to lose,” said Mr. Chirag Paswan. “The LJP’s ways are not easy but we’ll fight, and win as well.”

A young man who allegedly robbed two banks to repay his loans, after learning a few tricks from the internet, has been arrested by the city police here.

The man had incurred heavy losses in his business venture in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The accused was identified as Soumya Ranjan Jena (25), of Tangibanta village on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar. He robbed the two bank branches from where he had secured the loan, both located within three kilometres from his house.

“He had borrowed ₹19 lakh from the banks for an apparel and shoe shop. He was able to pay back ₹6 lakh. Our investigation found that his business transaction ranged between ₹9 lakh and ₹10 lakh per month before the lockdown. However, after the lockdown he found himself in a debt trap,” said Sudhansu Sarangi, Commissioner of Police for Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, on Monday.

“During the lockdown, he started watching videos on YouTube to learn how to carry out bank robberies. He bought an air-gun. Since he knew how the banks functioned, it was easy for him to target the two branches,” said Mr. Sarangi.

“He looted ₹12.34 lakh from the two banks. We have recovered ₹10.76 lakh from him. He told our investigator that he had no intention of robbing more. But our assessment is that he would have continued committing such crimes because it was easy money,” said the police chief.

He deposited ₹60,000 in his loan accounts and said he was planning to pay back the loans in phases to avoid suspicion. Police said the man belonged to a well-to-do family and had no previous criminal antecedents.

“It is very likely to move north-westwards towards north Andhra Pradesh and Odisha coasts with gradual intensification into a depression during subsequent 2-3 days,” the CWD of the India Meteorological Department said.

However, as of now, it has not made any forecast on its further intensification into a deep depression or a cyclonic storm.

“We are monitoring its (low pressure area development,” IMD Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said.

An existing low pressure area lies over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining Odisha coast.

It is very likely to persist there till October 5 and become less marked thereafter.

However, its associated cyclonic circulation is very likely to move over to south Chhattisgarh on October 6 and remain active till October 7, the IMD said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ny0ksr/article32770630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ODISHARAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/low-pressure-area-likely-to-form-over-andaman-sea-next-week-imd/article32770631.ece

207,2020/10/05,"FIR against RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad, others in Dalit leader murder case","Former RJD State secretary of SC/ST cell Shakti Mallik was gunned down on October 4 at his residence in Purnia town

Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav, his brother Tej Pratap Yadav and four others were on Sunday booked over the killing of Dalit leader and former RJD leader Shakti Mallik in Purnia district of northeast Bihar.

Former RJD State secretary of SC/ST cell Shakti Mallik was gunned down on October 4 at his residence in Purnia town. A country-made pistol and an empty cartridge were seized from his room.

“The deceased’s wife Khushboo Devi has lodged an FIR against Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap Yadav and four others at the local Khajanchi Haat police station for hatching a conspiracy to kill her husband”, Purnia Superintendent of Police Vishal Sharma said.

The others named in the FIR are Anil Kumar Sadhu, Kalo Paswan, his wife Sunita Devi and Manoj Paswan.

Anil Kumar Sadhu is son-in-law of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and president of RJD’s State SC cell. He was earlier with the Lok Janshakti Party.

Mallik, 38, was to contest the upcoming Assembly election from Raniganj (SC) seat in neighbouring Araria district.

Earlier, in a video that went viral on social media, the deceased had made serious allegations against Mr. Tejashwi Yadav and Mr. Sadhu for demanding ₹50 lakh for ticket to contest the election on RJD ticket.

The deceased had joined the RJD in 2019 and was made State SC/ST cell secretary of the party but after he allegedly was denied ticket and made serious allegations against party leaders, he recently was expelled from RJD.

Ms. Devi accused in the FIR that “since her husband was to contest the election as an Independent candidate, he was eliminated at the behest of RJD leaders including Tejashwi Yadav”.

“The probe in the case is under way to ascertain the involvement of the accused persons…the deceased’s wife has also provided the video clip in which Mallik had levelled serious charges against RJD leaders and others”, said Mr. Sharma.

However, local people told The Hindu that Mallik had a political rivalry with a local leader Kalu Paswan, although both were said to have reached a compromise.

Meanwhile, the killing of the Dalit leader also took a political colour in the poll-bound State. Ruling JD(U) leader Ajay Alok on Sunday demanded that the Election Commission should order a CBI probe into the incident as the election schedule had been declared in the State.

“Such has been the character of RJD leaders…they sell party tickets to amass wealth…Shakti Mallik and his family must get justice”, said BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand.

RJD leaders have called the allegations and the FIR politically motivated in view of the upcoming election.

“The FIR and charges made against party leaders Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap are baseless, fake and fabricated..it is nothing but politically motivated”, RJD leader and party spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qfcj12/article32769223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ADAVKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fir-against-rjds-tejashwi-prasad-others-in-dalit-leader-murder-case/article32769224.ece
208,2020/10/05,Protests erupt in West Bengal after murder of BJP leader,"Manish Shukla was shot dead at Barrackpore on Sunday evening

The murder of BJP councilor Manish Shukla in Barrackpore subdivision of West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas late on Sunday triggered protests and hectic political activity in the district and State capital Kolkata on Monday. Mr. Shukla was shot dead late in the evening by unidentified men on a motorbike close to the Titagarh police station.

While the BJP’s 12-hour bandh call in Barrackpore saw clashes between party workers and the police, leading to baton charges and tear gas firing, Kolkata saw protests and confrontation between BJP leaders and the police through the day.

At the State-run Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College in Kolkata where Mr. Shukla’s body was brought for a postmortem, scuffles broke out between police and BJP workers as several party leaders including Kaliash Vijayvargiya, and MPs Arjun Singh and Locket Chatterjee arrived. The leaders were allowed to enter the hospital only after a few hours.

Later in the evening, the BJP leadership wanted to take Mr. Shukla’s body to the Raj Bhawan but the police refused permission. After further protests and scuffles with the police, a delegation of party leaders including Mr. Shukla’s father, were allowed to meet Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar.

“There were 19 bullets in his body. The incident occurred in front of a police station and weapons used for the crime are mostly used by police. We demanded that a probe by CBI should be initiated in the crime,” Mr Singh, the MP from Barrackpore, said after meeting the Governor.

Speaking to journalists Mr. Vijayvargiya called the killing a “ political murder” and said people of the State will give a fitting reply to the Trinamool Congress government in the next Assembly elections.

“Had Manish not been killed in public, the police would have called it a case of suicide. In West Bengal the police is a magician that turns political murders into suicide,” he said.

Governor apprised

Earlier in the day, Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay met Governor Dhankhar after he issued summons to senior administrative officials to apprise him of the law and order situation. After the meeting, the Governor said “political violence and targeted killings must stop”.

“Conveyed my concern of the present alarming scenario @MamataOfficial to the new Chief Secretary. Am sure Chief Minister would be indicated all these critical aspects that run down democratic governance and lawlessness. Political violence and targeted killings must stop,” Mr Dhankhar said on social media.

‘Probing all angles’

The West Bengal police said it was looking into all possible reasons including personal enmity and also warned that “irresponsible comments on social media [were] tantamount to interference in the investigation”.

Taking to social media, the West Bengal police said: “A person was shot dead last evening in Titagarh area of Barrackpore. Police is investigating the crime and looking into all possible reasons including personal enmity because the victim was accused in some cases of murder and attempt of murder.”

The case is likely to be taken over by the State’s Criminal Investigation Department ( CID).

The deceased BJP leader was a councilor and member of BJP’s organisational unit for Barrackpore district. He was a close associate of Barrackpore BJP MP Arjun Singh, who defected from the Trinamool Congress ahead of the 2019 general election. The Barrackpore subdivision has been on boil since then.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/d7ygrk/article30648572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Vijayvargiya,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-leader-shot-dead-in-west-bengal-vijayvargiya-demands-cbi-inquiry/article32769006.ece
209,2020/10/05,Jammu and Kashmir-Ladakh tourism sector hit,"Sharp fall in number of visitors, says Ministry data

The COVID-19 pandemic along with the shutdown following abrogation of Article 370 in August last year has dealt a severe blow to tourism in the youngest Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh.

The number of tourists to Jammu and Kashmir stood at about 25.04 lakh (nearly 25 lakh domestic tourists and 5,056 foreign tourists), and to Ladakh at 6,079 (5,019 domestic tourists and 1,060 foreign tourists), this year till June 2020, according to Ministry of Tourism data shared in reply to an RTI query by Kochi-based activist K. Govindan Nampoothiry.

As per the provisional data shared, 1.62 crore visitors came to Jammu and Kashmir and more than 2.79 lakh tourists to Ladakh in the full year 2019. Of these, about 1.61 crore were domestic tourists and 57,920 people were foreign tourists. The number of visitors to Jammu and Kashmir is also lower compared to 2018, when the tourist numbers stood at over 1.72 crore, including 1.70 crore domestic tourists and over 1.39 lakh foreign visitors.

Border standoff

“The administration of Jammu & Kashmir should now take steps to unlock breathtaking tourist destinations to the public, promote them in domestic as well as in foreign arenas and brand J&K tourism,” Mr. Nampoothiry said, adding that the steep decline in the number of tourists to the Ladakh region was a key concern. “Tense situations on the LAC (Line of Actual Control) on regular intervals might be the primary reason for this plunge apart from COVID-19.” he added.

Pronab Sarkar, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), which represents more than 1,700 tour operators for inbound tourists, told The Hindu that the number of tourists to J&K and Ladakh had fallen considerably after the shutdown following the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, bringing tourism virtually to a standstill.

“Post that, in winter there was some tourism inflow but it was low...because of the severe cold, and then the pandemic hit. Since the end of March 2020, no tourism is happening... So, these figures are quite surprising, and seem to have included Vaishno Devi pilgrimage tourist inflow, which is growing every year,” he said.

Mr. Sarkar added that going forward, the tour operators are hoping that there would be a gradual revival and the government would facilitate movement of tourists at least within the country. “This will definitely revive the lost jobs and help improve the overall economy,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/q4yr6g/article32768513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LEH-LADAKHKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jammu-and-kashmir-ladakh-tourism-sector-hit/article32768514.ece
210,2020/10/05,Dalit leader shot dead in Bihar’s Purnea district,"It’s a political killing, alleges his wife

A 37-year-old Dalit leader was gunned down at his residence in Bihar’s Purnea district on Sunday and his wife alleged that it was a political killing as her husband was preparing to contest the upcoming Assembly election as an independent candidate after he was expelled from the RJD.

After the killing, a video in which the deceased, Shakti Malik, accused RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of seeking ₹50 lakh as donation to give him party ticket to contest the poll from Raniganj seat and threatening to eliminate him if he continues with his good work in the constituency, went viral.

The ruling JD(U) claimed that Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has exposed his true colours before the nation. Repeated efforts to reach senior RJD leaders for their reaction were unsuccessful.

Police said that three bike-borne men entered the house of Shakti Malik in Purnea in the morning and shot him in the head while he was sleeping, killing him on the spot, and fled.

A country-made pistol and an empty cartridge were found from the spot, K. Haat Station House Officer Sunil Kumar Mandal said. Superintendent of Police Vishal Sharma and Sadar Sub-Divisional Police Officer Anand Pandey visited the spot.

In the video that went viral, Malik claimed that he, along with the RJD’s SC/ST cell State unit president, met Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in Patna where the RJD leader sought ₹50 lakh as donation to give him party ticket to contest from Raniganj Assembly constituency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dalit-leader-shot-dead-in-bihars-purnea-district/article32768464.ece
211,2020/10/05,Protection of community land sought in Odisha,"‘Govt. acquiring them for industrial use’

Residents in Dhinkia village in Odisha’s Jagatsinghpur district have opposed laying of pipelines by Indian Oil Corporation using their common land — a space earmarked for community use.

A few years ago, villagers of Kharkhari Patharkata village in Dhenkanal district had lodged a complaint with public authority that their playground was demarcated as plot under Forest Rights Act. There were innumerable grievances against government which was accused of acquiring community land for creating land bank for future industrial use in the State.

With community land gradually vanishing under development pressure, villagers in Odisha have understood the danger of community being stripped off the important resource and started protesting the move.

While the environmental players are celebrating World Commons Week from September 30 to October 9 to reiterate the critical importance of commons in promoting rural livelihoods and sustaining climate order, experts have voiced concerns over growing pressure on community land.

“Till Indian Oil recently started digging our 11 acre of village common land for laying pipeline, villagers had no information. Both company officials and government had surreptitiously planned to use village common land without seeking permission from us,” alleged Debendra Swain of Dhinkia.

Dhinka villagers have registered a formal complaint with Jagatsinghpur district collector and sought immediate halt to laying pipeline. Similarly, Laxmi Tudu of Kharkhari Patharkata under Kankadahad block of Dhenkanal expressed surprise over handing over of football field as individual forest right under FRA while villagers were kept in dark.

‘Industrial land bank’

The State government has created over one lakh acre land bank across the State for allocation to the industries after dispute over land acquisition proved stumbling block for setting up of projects. Villagers allege most of these land patches were common land.

Common land or common property resources are meant for collective use of community. These land patches are either used as playing ground or grazing ground for livestock. Marginal farmers and landless people heavily depend on this critical resource.

“While commons substantially contribute to rural livelihoods and also provide a range of ecological services, the benefits have largely been invisible,” said Sanjoy Patnaik of Foundation for Ecological Security.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/protection-of-community-land-sought-in-odisha/article32768459.ece
212,2020/10/05,NFR to restart train services in Tripura,"CM Biplab Deb requests people to follow health protocol while travelling

With COVID-19 lockdown restrictions relaxed in Tripura, the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) is set to start limited train services in Tripura.

NFR’s chief public relation officer Subhanan Chanda said they have decided to resume three pairs of DEMU (diesel electric multiple unit) trains from Monday.

The DEMU trains would run between Dharmanagar (North Tripura) and Agartala; and Sabroom (South Tripura) and Agartala. The trains would halt at all stations along the routes.

The official said the decision to resume train services was taken after receiving a proposal from the State government.

The NFR has been operating one AC Special Train between New Delhi and Agartala on a weekly basis. It is running a total of 12 pairs of trains from the Northeast to different directions of the country, the official said.

Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb has requested people to follow health protocol while travelling in DEMU trains.

213,2020/10/05,"Answer questions on farm laws or quit, Yogendra Yadav tells Dushyant Chautala","‘Why is the Haryana Deputy Chief Minister clinging to the chair when crop is being sold below MSP?’

Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav, also national working group member of All-India Kisan Sangarsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), on Sunday posed 10 questions to Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala on the three farm laws and asked him to either reply or step down.

Flanked by farmer leaders at a press conference in Chandigarh, Mr. Yadav also extended support to a call by 17 farmers’ groups in Haryana on behalf of AIKSCC to lay siege to Mr. Chautala’s residence in Sirsa on October 6 on the issue of farm laws.

In an obvious reference to the resignation of Shiromani Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur from the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre over the controversial laws, Mr. Yadav said the farmers of Punjab had claimed a “wicket” in the very first over and now it was the turn of the Haryana farmers to take the second wicket.

Posing the questions, Mr. Yadav demanded to know whether Mr. Chautala or his party had ever demanded any law or a change similar to the three farm laws and were they ever consulted by the Bharatiya Janata Party before or after the ordinances were brought in. He further asked whether the three laws were in any way connected to the lockdown and coronavirus, and if not, then why they were brought amid the pandemic through ordinances.

Referring to the demand of the farmers to guarantee Minimum Support Price, Mr. Yadav sought to know as to why the demand for MSP was not guaranteed through law if these laws posed no danger to it. “Does Mr. Chautala support the manner in which the laws were passed in the Rajya Sabha? How the farmers would be benefited by the amendment in the Essential Commodities Act allowing hoarding? Have the companies been allowed to loot both — the farmers and the consumers?” asked Mr. Yadav.

Stance questioned

Questioning the stance taken by the JJP over the three farm laws, Mr. Yadav demanded to know as to why the descendant of Chaudhary Devi Lal alone was defending the laws when none of the farmer leaders and organisations were ready to speak in their support.

Asking Mr. Chautala to reply to the questions on October 6 to the farmers, he demanded to know as to why the Deputy Chief Minister was clinging to the chair when crop was being sold at a price lower than the MSP right under his nose.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7x1mt1/article32768434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE04-YADAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/answer-questions-on-farm-laws-or-quit-yadav-tells-dushyant/article32768435.ece

Sunrisers Hyderabad’s senior pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar was on Monday ruled out of the ongoing IPL with a thigh muscle injury which could also end his hopes of being a part of the Indian team’s tour of Australia later this year.

Bhuvneshwar sustained the injury while bowling the 19th over of Chennai Super Kings’ innings during their October 2 clash here and hobbled out of the field after just one delivery.

“Bhuvneshwar Kumar is out of IPL with a thigh muscle injury. It is probably a grade 2 or 3 injury, which could mean that he would be out for at least 6 to 8 weeks. It might effectively rule him out of India’s tour of Australia,” a senior BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

Bhuvneshwar had been in decent form during this year’s IPL with an economy rate of less than 7 in four games with three wickets.

His injury will be a massive blow to SRH skipper David Warner as he struggles for quality death bowlers in his side which is short on experience.

In case of Bhuvneshwar, he might stay back in the UAE as the Indian team’s physio Nitin Patel is also there as part of the BCCI’s medical team.

Being a centrally-contracted player, Bhuvneshwar’s rehabilitation will be entirely looked after by the BCCI.

However, for the past one year Bhuvneshwar has been mostly out, due to side strain and hamstring injuries and only recently, made a comeback during the IPL. he had missed the New Zealand tour earlier this year.

With this current injury, his readiness to return to competitive cricket after breaking down every three months during the last one year could raise eyebrows about the injury management process.

The national selection panel, headed by Sunil Joshi, is set to be asked to pick India’s squad for the series in Australia next week after Cricket Australia and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have almost agreed on the itinerary of the tour.

Day-night Test

A BCCI official confirmed that after weeks of rounds of discussion, both the Boards have “virtually decided” on starting the series on November 27 with three T20s, followed by three ODIs starting Dec. 4. The four-Test series is likely to begin with the day-night Test on Dec. 17, in Adelaide.

CA is understood to have sought the details of the whole BCCI entourage, including players, coaching staff, support staff and family members, if any, at the earliest. As a result, the national selectors may swing into action any time next week.

It is understood that CA has informed the BCCI that the venues for Test matches will be finalised in about a fortnight.

With the BCCI having postponed the annual general meeting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the three selectors whose term was supposed to have expired on Sept. 30 are set to be asked to pick the squad for the series.

The members of India’s touring party, including coaching staff, support staff and Test specialists like Cheteshwar Pujara and Hanuma Vihari, are likely to leave for the United Arab Emirates in the last week of October.

216,2020/10/05,Indian Premier League 2020 | Delhi reclaims top spot after thrashing Bangalore,"Stoinis’ muscular fifty and Rabada’s incisive strikes power Delhi to 59-run win

Delhi Capitals outclassed Royal Challengers Bangalore by 59 runs at the Dubai International Stadium on Monday. A fourth win in five matches took DC to the top of the IPL points table.

Faced with a huge target of 197, RCB stumbled to a disappointing 137 for 9. Only Virat Kohli (43, 39b, 2x4, 1x6) got among the runs for RCB, and when the skipper edged pacer Kagiso Rabada to the wicketkeeper, it was game over.

Rabada added three more wickets to his kitty, returning figures of four for 24.

Axar, Nortje shine

Axar Patel (two for 18), Anrich Nortje (two for 22) and R. Ashwin (one for 26) were impressive as well, choking the RCB batters by keeping a tight line and length. Spinners Axar and Ashwin were not afraid to give the ball air, tempting batsmen into playing false shots.

Nortje contributed by getting the key wicket of A.B. de Villiers (9, 6b, 2x4), whose slog only went as far as Shikhar Dhawan at mid-wicket.

Earlier, Marcus Stoinis (53 n.o., 26b, 6x4, 2x6) and Rishabh Pant (37, 25b, 3x4, 2x6) provided the late impetus to carry DC to a big total.

Stoinis and Pant came together when DC was struggling for momentum, at 90 for three. The duo got cracking, putting on an 89-run stand in 6.5 overs. Stoinis, his muscular frame exuding power, notched up his second fifty of the tournament.

Openers Prithvi Shaw (42, 23b, 5x4, 2x6) and Dhawan (32, 28b, 3x4) gave DC a good start, scoring 68 in 6.4 overs.

It took a brilliant catch to get rid of form batsman Shreyas Iyer (11, 13b, 1x4). Shreyas struck a full delivery from Moeen Ali to deep mid-wicket, where Devdutt Padikkal threw the ball in the air before stepping out of the field of play and then jumping back in to claim the catch.

RCB spinner Washington Sundar was once again impressive, giving just 20 runs in his four overs.

Saini, on the other hand, was not at his best. The fast-bowler delivered a dangerous beamer to Stoinis, just a couple of days after hitting Rajasthan Royals’ Rahul Tewatia with a speedy beamer. That Saini did not immediately apologise to Stoinis is sure to raise eyebrows.

Delhi Capitals’ senior leg-spinner Amit Mishra’s IPL stint this season has come to an abrupt end after he fractured his ring finger during the match against Kolkata Knight Riders in Sharjah.

The 37-year-old sustained the injury while going for a low return catch offered by KKR batsman Nitish Rana in the October 3 game. He was in pain but did well to bowl two overs during which he dismissed the dangerous Shubman Gill.

“Amit has fractured his ring finger and is out of IPL tournament. Obviously, it is a very disappointing news considering he was integral to DC’s plans,” a source from Mishra’s management team confirmed the development.

Every half hour or so during the TV telecast of the IPL, a question pops up for the commentators. It is usually requesting an explanation about team combination, strategies or choice of shots.

On Sunday evening, when Chennai triumphed against Punjab, the question that popped up on Star Sports Tamil was nothing to do with cricket. “Balaji anna, are you really going on leave for a couple of weeks?,” posted an anguished viewer.

Cricket at the IPL has been a welcome relief for sports fans after a few months of constant Covid-related updates. But what has kept fans across Tamil Nadu glued to their TV sets every evening is RJ Balaji’s wisecracks and comic punchlines that have made even boring matches watchable.

“The response [to Tamil commentary] has been amazing this year. 2020 has been such a dismal year that we wanted the IPL to cheer up people. And it has,” says Balaji, over phone from Mumbai.

He is referring to the overwhelming response that the Tamil commentary team has been getting. Balaji, in particular, has received a lot of congratulatory messages from people who say that his gags have lifted their spirits in troubled times. “My biggest strength is that I am not pretending to be someone else. I have earned this acceptance because of my stint in media for the past 15 years. Also, the sport has evolved; cricket has become family entertainment and that’s where I come in.”

RJ Balaji with Krishnamachari Srikkanth

He believes that his couple of hours on air during the IPL matches adds spice to this entertainment and regales families who have tuned in for cricket. “We get preparatory material before the match so I know the basics. But I leave the cricket talk to the experts and indulge in humour, which is unprepared.” His on-the-spot jokes are widely shared on social media and WhatsApp groups, which spread smiles even as people watched the battle between bat and ball keenly.

This includes his comments whenever a batsman hits a six (“the ball is lost, and it costs ₹ 15,000, and if I had that, I would have paid the electricity bill for the month”) and when there is any peculiar cricketing action on display. He is also popular for his pronunciation of cricketers’ names... Eoin Morgan and Rahul’s names roll off Balaji's tongue like they have been put inside a mixer grinder. “I reflect everyday life in cricket commentary. I see myself as a reflection of people,” he says.

A different outing

The RJ-actor has been associated with Star Sports Tamil since its launch in 2017, but this year has been different. “So many people are working behind the scenes to bring you live action. We want everyone to be safe and so get tested for COVID-19 every week. When we landed, we were locked in the room for 14 days and we are in a bio-bubble now. There are several protocols, but that is required to feel safe and keep us going for the next few weeks.”

Balaji’s stint so far has been largely filled with fun and humour, but the one event that left him in shock was the sudden passing away of Australian cricketer-turned-commentator Dean Jones. “Just the night before, he was talking to us about the busy cricket calendar in 2021 and how he would find it difficult to juggle between his commitments. I told him these exact words, ‘You don’t know what is going to happen in the next few days. How can you plan so far ahead?’ The next day, I woke up to the news of his death. It left me devastated.”

The subsequent passing away of singer SP Balasubrahmanyam also marked a sad phase for Balaji, but the show must go on, as they say, and Balaji sported his usual cheerful self on air during a week in which he was feeling dismal. “It was difficult, but TV is a live medium in which we convey our mood to millions of houses watching it. We had to somehow go on with it,” says the actor, whose co-commentators include Krishnamachari Srikanth, Hemang Badani, Abhinav Mukund, Subramaniam Badrinath, Muthu and RK.

Fans of his Tamil commentary will miss him for the next couple of weeks, when he’s on leave. He does not reveal the reason for his absence, but sources say it is to finalise release plans for his upcoming film, ‘Mookkuthi Amman’, starring Nayanthara. So, how’s that coming along? “The film is complete, but even if theatres open, I’m not sure how open families will be to visit cinema halls. My film is a family entertainer, and so we are waiting for the right time to make announcements. For now, there’s cricket for them to enjoy.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/uxg34b/article32771982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RJ-Balaji-1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rj-balaji-talks-about-his-hilarious-tamil-commentary-being-the-toast-of-the-ipl/article32771988.ece
219,2020/10/05,IPL 2020 | Shaky Royals to face rampaging Mumbai Indians,"Royals would like to arrest the slide before Ben Stokes completes his quarantine and is available from the October 11 game.

Rajasthan Royals may need to rejig their Indian line-up slightly when they try to pull their IPL campaign out of the current rot against a supremely confident Mumbai Indians in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.

Starting with a bang at Sharjah on a conducive batting surface, Royals have suddenly hit a slump on bigger grounds of Dubai and Abu Dhabi with their willow-wielders not looking half as menacing as they did during the first two games.

Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, have been solid in their last couple of games and are currently on top of the table by virtue of a better net run-rate compared to Delhi Capitals, also on six points.

After a heart-breaking loss to Royal Challengers Bangalore in the ‘Super Over’, the defending champions bounced back in style, defeating Kings XI Punjab and Sunrisers Hyderabad by 48 and 34 runs respectively.

The best part of MI’s camaign so far is that they have ticked almost all the boxes with skipper Rohit Sharma (176) in good touch and now Quinton de Kock also looking ominous.

Kieron Pollard is consistent as ever, Ishan Kishan has looked solid and Hardik Pandya is also finishing games with the bat. Hardik’s brother Krunal joined the party in the last game.

MI’s replacement pacer James Pattinson (7 wickets) has been a revelation alongside the redoubtable Jasprit Bumrah and the crafty Trent Boult. Once Hardik starts bowling, all the pieces of the puzzle will nicely fit in.

In contrast, Royals would like to arrest the slide before Ben Stokes completes his quarantine and is available from the October 11 game.

One of the primary reasons of their fall has been the poor form of Jos Buttler (47 runs from 3 games) along with yet another dismal show from Jaydev Unadkat (1 wicket from 4 games at 9.97 economy). The young Riyan Parag has also seemed completely out-of-depth unlike last year.

Skipper Steve Smith might consider dropping Parag, who is not exactly a top of the line off-spinner, and give another much-talked-about youngster Yashasvi Jaiswal a go at the top of the order. Smith might bring himself in the middle to give stability to the line-up.

In bowling, as mentor Shane Warne had told PTI, Unadkat probably is still not sure of his role and has not been good either in Powerplay or at the death, which leaves Tom Curran and Jofra Archer with a lot of heavy lifting to do.

Smith may try out the experienced Varun Aaron who has a lot more pace than Unadkat or the young Kartik Tyagi who can bowl at 140 kmph.

220,2020/10/05,"IPL 2020 | We back our players way longer than possible, says CSK coach Fleming","He credits the team’s bowling efforts between overs 17 and 20 for last night’s victory over Kings XI Punjab.

Chennai Super Kings’ “reticent” approach to change when faced with poor results has been the key to its success over the years, said head coach Stephen Fleming, citing veteran Australian all-rounder Shane Watson as a shining example of what the side has achieved.

Watson finally came good with an unbeaten 83 off 53 balls in his fifth game as an opener, helping the three-time IPL champions record an emphatic 10-wicket win over Kings XI Punjab here on Sunday after a hat-trick of defeats.

“I think it helps as players know they get more opportunities...We are reticent to changing the team other than realising the areas that we are not happy with. Also you are not sure if that change will help or not,” Fleming said in his post match online comments.

“We try and improve and if players are doing the right thing we will back them as long and even longer than possible,” CSK’s long-serving coach echoed what has been his skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s philosophy over a decade now.

Asked what did Watson do differently to get out of the bad patch, Fleming responded, “Nothing.”

“That’s the strength of an experienced player. If Shane had been struggling in the nets, then it would have been a concern but he was solid.

“It was a matter of time, little bit of fortune and some good positive thoughts from him. Shane, if he gets on a roll, will be very important to us,” he added.

A 10-wicket win can cover a lot of problem areas in the team’s performance but Fleming said CSK are far from being at their best in what is a marathon tournament.

“Performances like that covers up a lot of things but we are by no means where we want to be. Faf (Du Plessis) has been in great form but if Watto finds some form, it makes us a lot more competitive,” the coach said.

Fleming also felt that the turning point of the game was the period between the 17th and the 20th over in the KXIP innings when they scored only 42.

“Key for me was overs 17 to 20 where they went for 40 (odd), which could have been a lot more than that. Other games are going for high numbers. We kept them to 42 and that was very pleasing,” Fleming said.

For the former New Zealand captain, it’s the overall “attitude” of players that helps him provide “selection security” to his players.

“It’s important for the individual as they shouldn’t get too defensive. You have to be very courageous when things aren’t going your way,” he said.

“Sometimes bowlers can be too good so there is so much to consider but attitude is something that you can control so that we can provide some selection security,” said Fleming.

Kings XI Punjab batsman Mandeep Singh, after four defeats in five games, conceded that qualification for play-offs can get “challenging” from hereon.

“We have to win seven out of next nine games. It can definitely be challenging. The main issue is bowling. We have been struggling with death bowling.

“Hopefully we can address our bowling a bit and put up a better show,” Mandeep said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/atfz27/article27035040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FLEMING,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-we-back-our-players-way-longer-than-possible-says-csk-coach-fleming/article32770588.ece
221,2020/10/05,IPL 2020 | Watson and Faf backed themselves with the shots they’re known for: Dhoni,"Veteran batsman Shane Watson (83) and Faf du Plessis (87) remained unbeaten to help CSK chase down the target of 179 with ease against Kings XI Punjab

Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said doing the “small things right” shaped their emphatic 10-wicket win over Kings XI Punjab, here on Sunday.

Veteran batsman Shane Watson (83) and Faf du Plessis (87) remained unbeaten to help CSK chase down the target of 179 with ease.

“I think we did the small things right. That’s what was important to us. The kind of start we got in batting, that’s what we needed. Hopefully we’ll be able to replicate this in the coming games,” Dhoni said after the match.

Asked about Watson finding form after a string of failures, Dhoni said, “It’s not about being more aggressive. He was hitting it well in the nets and what you need is to do that in the middle. It was just a matter of time. ”

“Faf is like a sheet anchor for us, keeps playing those shots in the middle. He can always confuse the bowler with the lap shots and all coming in. They complement each other.”

He said his side banks on consistency in selection and head coach Stephen Fleming should be given credit for it.

“He (Fleming) does much credit for that. The good thing is we have one plan. It’s not that we don’t have debates, but it’s one plan, that’s the relationship between us.”

Asked about the earlier three losses on the trot, the former India captain said, “I feel looking at the first 3-4 games, what you really think is you restrict them to as little as possible and that can add pressure.

“Every team has a furious hitter who can disrupt the bowling and our bowlers did well. We needed momentum with the right kind of shots. Watto and Faf backed themselves with the shots they’re known for.”

Man-of-the-match Watson said he felt something “slightly off” technically in the earlier matches.

“So it was nice for it to come off. Just a combination of technique and intent. Was able to get the weight through the ball a lot better.

“Faf and me complement each other well. There are bowlers he (Faf) prefers to take on and he’s a great guy and good batting with him.”

Du Plessis also expressed hope that his side continue the good form shown in the game.

“Credit to Dhoni and Fleming, it’s obviously the CSK way, they stick with players a bit longer than other teams might. They stick with players that they feel will play in the final. Credit to the management. It’s not always as easy as it looks.”

KXIP captain KL Rahul said it was hard being on the losing side for so many games but promised to keep trying harder.

“There’s no rocket science, we know where we’re going wrong. The execution part has been bad,” he said.

“I thought 178 was a good score. The wicket stopped a bit when we started batting, we felt like 170-180 was par on this wicket. But we know if we don’t get wickets against players of this class, we’ll struggle.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gqy1dk/article32768584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WATTO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-watson-and-faf-backed-themselves-with-the-shots-theyre-known-for-dhoni/article32768585.ece

Coimbatore district has recorded a slight decline in the positivity rate of COVID-19 according to the Health Department. Officials said that the district’s positivity rate stood between 9 and 9.5 in the last three days. This meant that nine out of every 100 swab samples subjected to COVID-19 testing turned positive.

“Corresponding to the slight decrease in the test positivity rate, the number of daily cases has also reduced. The daily new cases were below 500 in the last three days,” said a health official and added that the department was expecting further slow decline in daily new cases in the coming days.

The district’s positivity rate was between 10 and 11 % in the first week of September which reduced towards the end of the month and till Monday.

The department attributed the decrease in the number of new cases and positivity rate as results of stringent containment activities that are being done street-wise.

According to the official, the case load in the district was distributed at 70:30 ratio in urban limits and rural limits.

“As of Monday, there were 223 containment zones in the district. Of these, 176 were in urban limits and 47 were in rural limits,” the official said.

The department has sought the cooperation of the public to register further decline in the new COVID-19 cases in the district.

Health workers found that many persons who go for COVID-19 test interacted with several people and visited multiple places like banks and grocery stores after giving swab sample.

It was found that many of them resorted to such activities to ensure that they completed certain works and responsibilities, fearing that they might test positive and get hospitalised.

According to Health Department, people who give swab samples for test, their close contacts and family members should remain in quarantine till the result comes.

If a person tests positive, the family members and close contacts should remain in home quarantine for the next 14 days, even if their test results return negative, officials say.

225,2020/10/05,Class XI admissions at Anaikatti tribal residential school likely in 2021,"With the recent upgrade of Government Tribal Residential High School at Anaikatti to a higher secondary school, the admission for Class XI is likely commence in the academic year 2021-22.

Sources at the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department said on Monday that the new staff members are yet to be recruited for Classes XI and XII. The recruitment process could not be fast-tracked as the school remains closed due to the pandemic. Moreover, the Class X students who passed out of the school in 2019-20 have already enrolled in other schools and institutes such as the Industrial Training Institute, hence bringing them back for Class XI admissions in 2020-21 will not be possible, according to the sources.

The school was upgraded as a high school in 1995. Regarding the reason behind the 25-year-long delay in the upgrading process, the sources said that the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department upgrades only one or two schools every year. The upgrade was a result of sustained efforts by the district administration and legislators from the district, sources said.

This will be beneficial for students from tribal communities to complete their school studies, particularly the girl students as their parents tend to discontinue their studies after Class X to avoid sending them to schools that are far away. As of Monday, the Government Tribal Residential High School has seen 213 fresh admissions for academic year 2020-21, which is expected to improve in 2021-22 once admissions for Class XI commences.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ux5tau/article32776780.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB06-SCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/class-xi-admissions-at-anaikatti-tribal-residential-school-likely-in-2021/article32776781.ece

231,2020/10/05,Farmers oppose selling of vegetables only to public,"As the farmers at the Uzhavar Sandhai in Sampath Nagar here were told not to sell vegetables to traders, they staged a sit-in protest at the shandy on Monday.

The shandy with 630 registered farmers is run by the Department of Agricultural Marketing where farmers from across the district used to bring their produce every day.

Due to COVID-19 pandemic and absence of public transportation, the arrival of farmers and produce had dropped significantly in the past six months. Against the usual 135 shops, less than 60 shops function now from 5.30 a.m. to 8 a.m.

Many people complained to officials that the farmers were selling vegetables to traders in the early hours and they did not get vegetables even at 6 a.m. Hence, the officials asked the farmers to sell vegetables to the public first and to traders after 8 a.m. Also, the traders were asked to purchase vegetables from the wholesale market.

On Monday, the arrival of vegetables was very less and the farmers sold most of their produce to the traders and the public returned without vegetables. When the officials questioned the farmers, they protested at the two entrances. They said the officials were acting against the welfare of farmers.

The farmers said they could not wait for the public to purchase and hence they were selling it to traders. The officials told them that as per norms they could sell vegetables only to people who come there. Later, the farmers withdrew the protest and left with their produce without selling in the shandy.

A senior official told The Hindu the traders purchased the vegetables from the farmers and sold it with profit outside the shandy. Despite warning, they continued to do so. “When we questioned the farmers, they staged protest,” the official added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/l4rmkl/article32776400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER06SANDHAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/farmers-oppose-selling-of-vegetables-only-to-public/article32776401.ece
232,2020/10/05,NECC suggests egg price at ₹5.25,"The suggested sale price of eggs in the poultry hub of the State crossed over ₹5 for third day.

According to officials at Namakkal zone of National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC), the suggested price for 100 eggs fixed by Namakkal zone was ₹525 on Monday. The price has remained the same from Saturday and according to officials, this has been the highest price suggested in recent times. According to authorities, last time a higher price for egg was quoted was in November 2017 at ₹516 for 100 eggs.

P. Selvaraj, Chairman of the Namakkal zone, said that demand from places outside Tamil Nadu has led to this increase.

Mr. Selvaraj said, “Usually during the month of Puratasi the price of eggs drops since consumption of non-vegetarian food is less during the month due to cultural reasons in the State. However, demand from Northern States such as Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh has contributed to the price increase. Also, the production has reduced.”

Mr. Selvaraj said that while consumption within Tamil Nadu is less, the demand from Mumbai, Uttar Pradesh has increased after prices of vegetables increased in those areas following rain.

Mr. Selvaraj said that around 30-40 lakhs eggs are being sent to the Northern regions each day. He saidd that the production of eggs have also decreased due to COVID-19 crisis as many poultry farmers didn’t rear chicks. He said that the price is expected to normalise once production increases and at present, three crore eggs are being produced in the State while it was 3.5 crore earlier.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/necc-suggests-egg-price-at-525/article32776354.ece

234,2020/10/05,Western region now pins hope on NE monsoon,"Southwest monsoon saw eight districts record above average rainfall

The Southwest monsoon that had just existed saw eight revenue districts - Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Erode, Tiruppur, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris - recording above average rainfall. With the predictions showing a positive sign, the region pins hopes on a good bountiful Northeast monsoon.

In the past there had been years, when the region received below average rainfall. Though Pilloor reservoir, that caters to drinking water needs had surplussed more than once, the same could not be witnessed in Siruvani despite rain, as Kerala was maintaining the storage below the Full Reservoir Level (FRL).

For the second consecutive year, Coimbatore received excess rainfall during the Southwest monsoon season from June to September. The district this year has thus far received 269 mm as against the season’s average of 195 mm. And, most of the 269 mm has come in September, says S.P. Ramanathan, Prof. and Head, Agro Climate Research Centre at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. The district has received over 115mm this September as against the months’ average of 70.7mm. Last year, the district received 308.1mm. And, August 2019 alone brought in 221.3mm and that too in seven rainy days, he says. A day with over 2.5 mm precipitation is accounted for as a rainy day.

The Northeast monsoon prediction for Coimbatore is again good in that the Centre has said that there may be 318mm rainfall from October to December as against the average of 343.8mm.

According to the District Agro-Meteorology unit under the Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Salem, an average rainfall of 351 mm is expected during the monsoon in the district. During Southwest monsoon, an average rainfall of 386.5 mm was recorded till September 24.

In Namakkal, according to studies conducted by Gramin Krishi Mausam Seva under the department of livestock production management under Veterinary College and Research Institute, Namakkal, the district has received 49 mm excess of average rainfall expected during Southwest monsoon.

However, in Krishnagiri district this year, the Southweest monsoon brought in 420.38mm of rainfall, as compared to the last year’s rainfall of 345.49mm. The Southwest monsoon brought in copious amount of rainfall way above the annual average.

For the second consecutive year, the Southwest monsoon in the Nilgiris brought intense showers to the Nilgiris.

Scientists from the Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation (ICAR-IISWC) in Udhagamandalam, said that there had been “deficient” rainfall during the month of July in both 2019 and 2020. They said that the quantity of rainfall the district received in the same month over the last two years was between 40-60 % lesser than the average. They added that these relatively drier months were followed up by higher quantities of rain over shorter spells of time over the last two years, increasing the chances of landslips and flooding. The dams in the district are almost at full capacity due to the rain in the district during August and September of this year. According to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco), most of the dams are above 90 % of their total storage capacity.

Southwest monsoon in Erode district during July and September was normal as most of the areas received rainfall this year.

Officials at the Meteorological Department said that so far the district received 217 mm.

Due to rain in the catchment areas, the major reservoir in the district, Bhavani Sagar, received copious water in the past two weeks. On Monday, the water level at the reservoir stood at 101.14 feet against the full reservoir level of 105 feet. The storage at the reservoir stood at 29.627 tmc.

235,2020/10/05,Market for Kangeyam cattle resumes at Palayakottai,"The cattle market was held on Sunday, after remaining suspended for over six months due to the COVID-19 lockdown

The cattle market exclusively for the Kangeyam cattle breed, organised by Palayakottai Pattagar Cattle Farm and Research Centre (PPCFRC) resumed on Sunday at Palayakottai village panchayat in Kangeyam Block, after remaining suspended for over six months due to the COVID-19 lockdown.

According to PPCFRC trustee V. Sivakumar, the weekly cattle market was held at Palayakottai Mattu Thavani with COVID-19 precautionary measures in place from 8.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. The cattle market has resumed now, following the State government permitting the reopening of weekly shandies from October 1, he said.

As many as 27 head of cattle of Kangeyam breed were brought to the market on Sunday, out of which 13 were sold. Around 300 visitors came to the Palayakottai Mattu Thavani, and were screened for body temperature using thermal scanners before they entered, and were checked for masks by a team of eight volunteers. “No children or senior citizens were allowed,” Mr. Sivakumar said. A public address system was also installed to monitor and announce COVID-19 precautionary measures at the cattle market.

Prior to the lockdown, the market used to witness around 150 head of cattle every week, he said. The announcement for the resumption of the Palayakottai market was made on social media at short notice, because of which the turnout was low on Sunday, according to Mr. Sivakumar. Expecting a higher turnout for next Sunday, he said that more volunteers will be present at the premises to ensure that the precautionary measures are being followed and visitors who do not adhere to the COVID-19 guidelines will be fined.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mq80fw/article32772577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05OCTTH--Cattlejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/market-for-kangeyam-cattle-resumes-at-palayakottai/article32772578.ece
236,2020/10/05,Fresh ink for COVID quarantine stamp at Delhi airport after Congress leader’s complaint,"Passengers who have to undergo quarantine at home are stamped “home quarantine” on their hands by the Delhi state authorities when they are leaving the Delhi airport.

A fresh batch of ink is being used in the COVID-19 quarantine stamp for international passengers at the Delhi international airport after a Congress leader complained about pain and itchiness due to the chemical used in it, said senior government officials on Monday.

“After the complaint, the Delhi state authorities have started using a fresh batch of ink to stamp incoming international passengers,” said one of the officials.

As per rules, all international passengers have to undergo seven days of institutional quarantine followed by seven days of home quarantine post arriving in Delhi. However, certain categories of passengers like those with COVID-negative certificates from a test done 96 hours prior to the journey are exempted from institutional quarantine.

Passengers who have to undergo quarantine at home are stamped “home quarantine” on their hands by the Delhi state authorities when they are leaving the Delhi airport.

Madhu Goud Yaskhi, National Secretary and Spokesperson, Congress asked Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Twitter on Sunday if he can “please look into the chemical being used at Delhi airport for stamping on passengers coming from abroad”.

He said he was stamped when he came from abroad to Delhi on Saturday and it has been “continuously painful and itchy.”

Mr. Puri replied: “Thank you for drawing my attention to this. I have spoken to CMD AAI (Airports Authority of India).”

However, since Delhi airport is managed by GMR-group led DIAL, it replied to Mr. Yaskhi on Twitter that “this batch of ink is being kept aside for testing by the supplier and further desired action.”

“We deeply regret the inconvenience caused. The ink used for stamping is a standard indelible ink. We’ve reported the issue to the Delhi state authorities,” the DIAL added.

Senior government officials said on Monday that the Delhi State authorities at the airport have started using a fresh batch of ink to stamp the incoming international passengers.

237,2020/10/05,Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal launches campaign against air pollution ahead of winter,"There is a spike in pollution across north Indian States during the season

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched a campaign against air pollution, ahead of winter.

There is a spike in pollution across north Indian States during the season, especially between October and December, said Mr. Kejriwal.

The announcement came following Mr. Kejriwal’s meeting with several government agencies including multiple departments, civic bodies and the police over the issue.

“Over the last 5 years, the people of Delhi have ensured that pollution levels do not increase despite increase in traffic and industrial activity. In fact, these have actually decreased,” Mr. Kejriwal said at a digital briefing.

“In 2014, PM 2.5 levels were at the average level of 154; this reduced by 25% to 115 in 2018-19. This year, pollution can be deadly for us because the Coronavirus has spread all around us,” he also said.

Beginning Monday, Mr. Kejriwal said, the Delhi government would begin multiple initiatives to tackle pollution levels in the city, including the creation of a 24x7 war room, pollution hotspots and the repair of potholes.

One of the most significant aspects of the campaign, he said, was the use of the bio-decomposer technique developed by the PUSA research institute which the Delhi government will be taking to farmers’ doorsteps from Tuesday.

The government would also seek to rein in dust pollution at construction sites and undertake mechanical sweeping even as the agencies concerned had been directed to repair potholes from which dust emanates in their jurisdiction.

“We have also delineated 13 pollution hotspots for which detailed and specific plans will be made. We are creating the ‘Green Delhi’ app, which will receive complaints of pollution that will be need to be taken care in a time-bound manner,” he said.

The Delhi government will also create a war room, where air pollution levels will be monitored around the clock, he said.

“This war room will be monitored by me personally and will send me a report every day,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

The Chief Minister also appealed to other State governments to ensure that they too figured out alternatives to help their farmers deal with the issue of stubble like in Delhi and to ensure that coal-based power plants and brick kilns located near the capital were not allowed to operate.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/6x0fnt/article32768944.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jatin--KejriwalG567QTGNP3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-chief-minister-arvind-kejriwal-launches-campaign-against-air-pollution-ahead-of-winter/article32771497.ece
238,2020/10/05,Take action against officers for neglecting woman’s complaint: Delhi High Court,"Police did not act upon her complaint to trace her daughter as they were “poor”

The Delhi High Court has ordered the Commissioner of Police here to take “serious and effective” action against its officers who neglected the complaint of a woman to trace her missing daughter as she was “poor”.

“We are not only anguished but also disgusted at the manner in which the police carry out the investigation in such cases, particularly when it involves the poor,” a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar remarked.

“The petitioner [mother] works as a maid and her complaint/FIR was, therefore, neglected and not acted upon with the urgency that it deserves,” the Bench said.

“The action taken against those found guilty of negligence and dereliction of duty should be such that it sends message to the entire police force,” the court demanded.

The court’s direction came while hearing a habeas corpus plea of the woman to produce her minor daughter, who went missing on May 27 this year.

She complained that despite her registering the complaint with the police in Trilokpuri here, the officials took no action.

Verification of age

When the case was first heard by the Bench on September 23, Standing Counsel Delhi Police Rahul Mehra said the date of birth of the girl was verified from the school record, which shows that she is 16-years-old. Mr. Mehra said she got married to one Sandeep on the basis of the date of birth in her Aadhaar Card, which was incorrect.

The court had then opined that it was inclined to transfer the case to transfer the investigation to the Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU), Crime Branch, as she is a minor and, has been missing for nearly four months.

Girl found in Hathras

On September 29, when the court took the case again, the Delhi Police filed a status report stating that she has been recovered from Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. The girl was produced in court, where it was also revealed that she was three months pregnant.

The police said Sandeep is in judicial custody. Her mother said she wishes to take the minor home but the latter refused. Considering the fact that the girl is a minor, the Bench said, “We cannot let her go anywhere according to her wish.”

It directed that she should continue to be housed at Nari Niketan where she should also be provided counselling so that she is able to take responsible decision with regard to the continuation or discontinuation of her pregnancy. The court then noted that despite Sandeep being named in the FIR, no serious effort was made to locate her. It was only when the petition was filed and the court called for transfer of the investigation to AHTU (Crime) that the girl was recovered.

“This delay on the part of the police in carrying out effective investigation has ruined not only the life of the girl but also the accused and put in dark the future of the unborn child,” the Bench said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wviq14/article32769600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE04HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/take-action-against-officers-for-neglecting-womans-complaint/article32769601.ece
239,2020/10/05,"Woman gang-raped, beaten up in Gurugram; four held","Teenager raped in another case, accused on the run

In two separate incidents, a 25-year-old woman was allegedly gangraped and beaten up by four men in upscale DLF Phase-II and a minor was raped in the Millennium City on Sunday. The woman sustained head injuries during the assault.

While the four men, including three delivery boys, have been arrested in connection with the gang-rape, the accused in the rape case of the minor is on the run.

According to the police, one of the four accused, Ranjan, met the woman near Sikanderpur metro station late on Saturday night and took her to his employer’s office in the basement of a building on Bougainvilla Marg. “When the woman reached the house, she found three men were present inside. The four men allegedly took turns to rape her. When she resisted, they beat her up and smashed her head against the wall causing injuries,” said Assistant Commissioner of Police (DLF) Karan Goyal.

Fled away

The four fled away leaving the woman behind on the road outside. After hearing the woman’s cries, security guards in the area alerted a police patrolling team. A team from the local police station also reached and took her to a hospital.

Ranjan was arrested in the morning when he returned to office. “The security guards informed the police when Ranjan returned around 6 a.m. He locked himself inside, but the police smashed the glass door to enter the office,” said a resident of DLF Phase-II.

Rajan works at the office of a realtor and had the keys to it. The other three have been identified as Pawan, Pankaj and Gobind. All four are aged between 20-25 years.

In another case, the accused, Bablu Sheikh, a chauffeur, allegedly dragged a 15-year-old girl inside his room when she went to a washroom near her jhuggi in Sector 45 in the early hours of Sunday. The accused allegedly raped her and threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident. A case has been registered at Sector 40 police station.

Claims over complaint

Haryana Shiv Sena spokesperson Ritu Raj said, “The family called the police control room in the morning, but the police ‘persuaded’ not to pursue the matter legally citing social ignominy. The case was registered after I took up the matter with the Police Commissioner,” claimed Mr. Raj.

Station House Officer, Sector 40, Sunil Beniwal denied the allegations and said that the case was registered soon after the family gave a complaint in the evening.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/m84b08/article32722367.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16DECTH--RAPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/woman-gang-raped-beaten-up-in-gurugram-four-held/article32768158.ece
240,2020/10/05,Arvind Kejriwal to address global forum meet on climate change on Oct. 7,"He will highlight measures taken in Delhi to tackle pollution

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will be among the five urban leaders from around the world to speak at the prestigious ‘Daring Cities 2020’ conference on October 7, the Delhi government said here on Sunday.

The conference is being hosted by the ICLEI and the City of Bonn, Germany, with the support of the German government. ‘Daring Cities’ is a global forum on climate change for urban leaders tackling climate emergency, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the statement said.

The plenary session, to be held at 7.30 p.m. through a virtual forum on Wednesday, will also include keynote addresses by António Guterres, UN Secretary General, and H.E. Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), Germany.

Multilevel action

“CM Kejriwal has been invited alongside urban leaders and decision-makers from Bogota [Colombia], Sao Paolo [Brazil], Los Angles [USA] and Entebbe [Uganda] to discuss multilevel action to tackle the climate emergency and environmental sustainability. The event recognises these five as daring urban leaders who are going beyond the limits imposed by their respective local contexts to take bold climate action,” the government said.

Mr. Kejriwal will speak on how Delhi has responded to the existing climate emergency, air pollution crisis, including recent innovative solutions such as the Pusa decomposer and the first-of-its-kind EV policy in India to tackle air pollution in the Capital.

“The distinguished urban and sub-national leaders from Latin America, Africa, North America, and Asia will also present their thoughts on the most essential changes that should be achieved in their respective city/region in the next five years so that their plans to tackle climate emergencies are accelerated,” the government also said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qvymnx/article32768144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04DELPRIYAKEJRIWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-to-address-global-forum-meet-on-climate-change-on-oct-7/article32768145.ece
241,2020/10/05,Section 29 of POCSO Act applicable only after trial begins: Delhi High Court,"Question over presumption of guilt cropped up when the court was hearing bail plea of a man in a sexual assault case

The Delhi High Court has ruled that the presumption of guilt engrafted in Section 29 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act gets triggered and applies only once trial begins, that is after charges are framed against the accused.

Section 29 of the POCSO Act says that when a person is prosecuted for committing an offence of sexual assault against a minor, the special court trying the case “shall presume” the accused to be guilty.

Proving innocence

This reverse burden on the accused to prove his innocence was incorporated in the POCSO Act keeping in view the low conviction rate of sexual offences against children.

The question of whether the presumption of guilt applies only at the stage of trial or does it also apply when a bail plea is being considered cropped up while hearing the bail plea of a 24-year-old man arrested for alleged sexual assault of a minor.

Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani clarified that if a bail plea is being considered before charges have been framed, Section 29 has no application. ‘Trial’ commences when charges are framed against an accused and not before that, Justice Bhambhani said.

Only at the stage when charges are framed does the court apply its judicial mind to whether there is enough evidence on record to frame a precise allegation, which the accused must answer, Justice Bhambhani said.

Disclosing one’s defence

“Therefore, it is only once charges are framed that the accused knows exactly what he is alleged to be guilty of; and therefore, what guilt he is required to rebut,” he said, adding an accused cannot be asked to disprove his guilt even before the foundational allegations with supporting evidence that suggest guilt are placed by the prosecution before the court.

“It would be anathema to fundamental criminal jurisprudence to ask the accused to disclose his defence; or, worse still, to adduce evidence in his defence even before the prosecution has marshalled its evidence,” the High Court said.

Justice Bhambhani also set out fresh norms while deciding a bail plea at the post-charge stage. “In addition to the nature and quality of the evidence before it, the court would also factor in certain real-life considerations,” Justice Bhambhani said.

This include whether the offence alleged involved threat, intimidation, violence or brutality. Also the court, hearing the bail would consider, whether the offence was repeated against the victim.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/46sp0o/article32716602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHIHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/section-29-of-pocso-act-applicable-only-after-trial-begins-hc/article32768133.ece
242,2020/10/05,CM will launch mega anti-pollution campaign today,"Kejriwal will chair a meeting with departments concerned before its launch

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will launch a mega anti-air pollution campaign here on Monday.

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the campaign would be launched following a meeting chaired by the Chief Minister with the departments concerned, at 11 a.m.

“Chief Minister will launch a mega anti-air pollution campaign after a meeting with officials from departments of environment, transport, development, PWD, Delhi Development Authority, Delhi Jal Board, traffic police and municipal corporations,” Mr. Rai tweeted.

At a meeting of NCR States with Union Environment Prakash Javadekar last week, Mr. Rai had asked the Centre to take time-bound action to ensure that 11 thermal power plants and more than 1,900 brick kilns using outdated technology in the NCR controlled their emissions.

There are 11 plants located in three States around the Capital — Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab — which were to retrofit their units with technology called flue-gas desulphurisation to reduce emissions by December 2019. According to Mr. Rai, there are more than 1,640 such brick kilns in Uttar Pradesh, 161 in Haryana and 164 in Rajasthan which contribute significantly to Delhi’s air pollution.

Mr. Rai also said that the Delhi government had presented its plan to tackle stubble burning in the city during the meeting with Mr. Javadekar.

He said a centre is being set up in Kharkhari village in Najafgarh where “bio-decomposer” solution will be prepared in around 400 containers, starting Tuesday, as announced by Chief Minister on Wednesday.

The new technology involves a liquid formulation prepared using bio-decomposer capsules, fermenting it over 8-10 days and then spraying the mixture on crop residue to ensure speedy bio-decomposition of the stubble.

243,2020/10/05,Delhi schools to remain shut till Oct. 31: Sisodia,"Final decision rests with States or UTs

Refuting reports of partial reopening of schools in Delhi in the wake of fresh guidelines by the Centre, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, on Sunday tweeted that all schools in Delhi will remain shut till October 31 in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As per the latest Unlock guidelines, schools, colleges and other educational institutions outside containment zones can reopen after October 15. However, the decision on whether to reopen educational institutions has been left with States and Union Territories.

The Delhi government had earlier said that schools will remain closed till October 5, though the Centre had permitted calling students of Classes IX to XII to schools on voluntary basis from September 21.

“The Directorate of Education [DoE] has been directed to extend the ongoing closure of schools till October 31. Formal orders to this effect will be issued by the DoE tomorrow [Monday],” an official at the Deputy Chief Minister’s office said.

Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the Centre had announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. On March 25, the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-schools-to-remain-shut-till-oct-31-sisodia/article32768047.ece
244,2020/10/05,Silent protest march for man killed in accident,"Mishap happened over a month ago

Nearly hundred people took out a silent protest march in Nirvana Country, a township in Sector 50 here, seeking justice for Alok Gupta, a 49-year-old senior executive with a multinational company killed in a road accident near DLF Phase-II Rapid Metro station over a month ago.

They marched till The Close, South, where the juvenile driver resides, said a press statement issued by the family.

Demand parents’ arrest

“It is shocking how the family of the culprit continues to remain untouched while the family of Gupta has been shattered. The march was to foreground the police’s disregard against the parents of the juvenile and to demand their arrest,” said the press statement.

Gupta was on his way to Noida riding his bike around 6 a.m., when a car coming from the direction of Shankar Chowk hit the central verge to jump on to the opposite carriageway and rammed the motorcycle after hitting the metro pillar.

Gupta’s friend Rahul Malik, a developer, riding another motorcycle behind him, took him and the two others in the car to Naraina Hospital in DLF Phase-III in an ambulance with the help of security guards.

Alok died during treatment. He was a resident of Sector 57 and was the chief financial officer of an MNC.

Gupta’s family has been demanding that Section 304 Part-II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) be invoked and the father of the juvenile in conflict with the law be also booked.

‘No legal liability’

DLF Phase-II Station House Officer Aman Beniwal said the juvenile’s parents had no legal liability in the matter since the vehicle involved in the accident didn’t belong to them.

“The owner of the vehicle has already been arrested,” said Mr. Beniwal. He refused to comment on invoking Section 304 Part-II saying that the matter was under investigation.

“The case has been registered under the relevant Sections,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/silent-protest-march-for-man-killed-in-accident/article32768017.ece
245,2020/10/05,"Coronavirus | With 2,683 cases, virus count touches 2,90,613 in Delhi","Active cases fall below 25,000 mark after almost 25 days

As many as 2,683 new COVID-19 cases were reported in Delhi in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 2,90,613, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Sunday. Also, 38 more deaths have been reported and the death toll has touched 5,510.

Of the total cases, 2,60,350 people have recovered and there are 24,753 active cases. The number of active cases has fallen below the 25,000 mark after almost 25 days.

246,2020/10/05,Air quality expected to be ‘moderate’ over next 3 days,"‘Likely to fall into poor category later’

The overall air quality of the Capital was in the higher end of the moderate category on Sunday and is expected to remain at the edge of the category for the next three days, according to government-run monitoring agency SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research).

“AQI [Air Quality Index] is forecast to stay at the edge of moderate category for the next three days as ventilation coefficient is still moderately high due to not so calm prevailing surface winds,” SAFAR said in a statement.

Though stubble burning fires were observed on Saturday around Punjab, Haryana, and border regions and boundary layer wind direction is favourable for transport of its effect towards Delhi, higher local wind speed is preventing accumulation of pollutants in the city.

Also, only a marginal stubble impact on AQI is expected for the next two days, according to SAFAR.

The AQI on Sunday was 184, which is “moderate” and slightly less than 189 on Saturday, according to CPCB.

“Currently, about half the stations in Delhi are in the poor category and the rest in moderate. So, the overall AQI is moderate. Local wind speed is above 4 km/hr and the ventilation coefficient (VC) is about 4,000. But later this week, the probability of the air quality turning poor is very high,” a SAFAR official told The Hindu.

VC is the product of mixing height (the height of the atmosphere up to which pollutants can be dispersed) and average wind speed. So, a higher VC means that mixing height and wind speed at high and this aids in better dispersion of pollutants and hence reduce pollution.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/air-quality-expected-to-be-moderate-over-next-3-days/article32767955.ece
247,2020/10/05,Workers returning to Delhi post-lockdown stare at joblessness,"Several workers returning to Gurugram and Delhi from their home towns after the lockdown discover their employers have already filled their positions

Vijay Mishra, a chhole-poori vendor on Jharsa Road in Gurugram, is the odd man out among a row of fruit sellers. The 38-year-old makes ₹200-₹300 daily, not even half of what he used to earn at his job in Maruti Suzuki India Limited before the lockdown.

Like thousands of workers and labourers in the Millennium City, Mr. Mishra left for his home town in Bihar along with his wife and two kids, aged five and seven, after the lockdown was imposed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

“Being the breadwinner, I did not have enough savings to stay in the city without work. Besides, there was no certainty over the resumption of production at the company,” he said.

Little support

“I had left with a promise to myself to not return. I have no landholdings back in my village but was confident of finding some work to make ends meet. I also expected the government to help the migrants returning to Bihar to find jobs. But we got little support from the government except the sanctioned ration against ration cards,” laments Mr. Mishra, while frying pooris for his customers.

Seeing hordes of workers returning to cities in search of jobs, Mr. Mishra too decided to come back to Gurugram in July in the hope that he could get back his factory job. But he was in for a rude shock.

“On reaching Gurugram, I found that the company had fixed a deadline for workers to join work. Those who could not make it, lost their jobs,” said Mr. Mishra, who had been a contract worker with the company for eight years.

With no other option left, he decided to become a roadside vendor.

Maruti Udyog Kamgar Union general secretary Kuldeep Janghu said most of the automotive companies were granted permission to resume operations in May. The three original equipment manufacturers in the region – Maruti Suzuki, Honda Motorcycles and Hero Motorcorp — and other automotive companies had asked their employees, both regular and contractual, to return to work by the first week of June.

“Maruti Suzuki extended the deadline till June 23 following a request from the workers’ union. The other companies too extended their deadlines by a few days or weeks. But many workers, mostly those on contract and hailing from far-off places like Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, could not make it in time and were not taken,” said Mr. Janghu.

He claimed that hundreds of workers who returned to the city in July and August called him up seeking help in getting their jobs back, but he could do little to assist them. “The company had hired workers in their place before they returned,” Mr. Janghu said, adding that the company’s production is on a par with the corresponding period last year.

Babul Haq, an operator at Richa & Co., a garments unit based in Udyog Vihar Phase-III in Gurugram, had a rather pleasant experience. He returned to his home town in May after his mother died, but got a call from the company in August to join work. “The company had hired many new workers during the lockdown, but they are now being replaced by the old workers returning to their jobs. We have also got a raise of ₹500 per month,” said Mr. Haq.

Munender Gautam, a resident of Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, went back to his village in June. Though not keen to return, he came back after a call from his supervisor. “I did not have any work, so I decided to come back. The company called its old employees and also gave a raise of ₹1,000 per month,” said Mr. Gautam, who works at a textile unit in Panipat. He added that most of the old employees had returned to work.

Biju Rai from Raghopur in Bihar returned to Delhi a fortnight ago but has been unable to find a job or earn two square meals a day. “Work is scarce but I hope things improve,” he said, adding that he had gone back to his village in June when some restrictions were eased. The journey was an ordeal as Mr. Rai was unable to get a train ticket and had to take several buses as well as walk long distances intermittently to reach his home town.

Tough phase

Another migrant worker, Asaram, said he returned to Delhi only some days back. He had left for his home town in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, during the lockdown. Like most migrant workers returning to the city for work, the 24-year-old left his wife and two kids at home. “I share a room with others near Ambedkar College and cook my own food to save money,” he said. The nature of his job has, however, changed. “I am a construction worker but currently doing road maintenance work,” he said.

Brijesh, working with BLU Smart Mobility, an app-based cab company, said he got his job back after the lockdown but suffered a salary cut. A resident of Agra, Brijesh said that salary had been cut substantially but the expenditures remained intact.

“Though it is difficult to survive on the paltry income, I feel lucky to have a job at least. Job loss, salary cuts and dwindling incomes — this is the story all around,” summed up Brijesh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kcb39j/article32767638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05-MIGRANT4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a-shock-awaits-many/article32767641.ece

257,2020/10/05,"Dengue, malaria under control, says GHMC","Officials attribute it to successful anti-larval measures

The much-dreaded spread of the dengue fever has been under control so far in the city, when compared to its incidence last year during the same time. The GHMC officials attribute it to the successful anti-larval activities by the Entomology department.

According to details shared by the Entomology wing of GHMC, last year, during September, a total of 1502 Dengue cases, confirmed and suspected, were reported to the Health authorities from the city. Of these, 587 were confirmed cases, while 915 were suspected. During October, the total number of cases were 745, of which 307 were confirmed, and 438 suspected.

These were only the reported cases, with data collected from the government and private hospitals.

This year, during September, the total number of Dengue cases were 48, of which the confirmed cases were only three. In October, so far, three cases have been reported, of which two are confirmed.

Total number of Dengue cases starting since January up to October this year have been 229, as against the 2471 cases last year, both confirmed and suspected together.

Officials informed that Dengue fever can be confirmed only through Elisa antibody diagnostic test, whereas in private hospitals, patients are admitted based on NS1 Antigen test results too.

“Last year, government had made it mandatory to take two samples from the Dengue suspected patients, and send one to the nearest government facility for testing. This year, however, the same is not being adhered to by the private hospitals,” said an official. Malaria cases too have come down drastically, from 76 last year, to mere three this year.

While the torrential rains which led to increased flow in water bodies too has contributed to the washout of the mosquito eggs and larvae, GHMC officials attribute it to the anti-larval activities taken up by the corporation.

Listing the vector control operations by GHMC, Chief Entomologist A.Rambabu said weekly anti-larval activities have been taken up with 642 teams in domestic, and peri-domestic mosquito breeding sources. Every day, a lakh houses are being covered, he said.

On an average, 3,000 to 3,500 houses are being identified as positive for mosquito breeding daily, based on the sources of stagnant water. All such positive sources identified are being removed and treated with larvicides.

Overhead tanks, sumps, pit-taps and water storage containers such as drums, tins, pots and waste material are being checked regularly for identification and arresting of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles mosquito breeding.

258,2020/10/05,"When will you appoint Women Commission chairperson, HC asks State","Telangana High Court on Monday directed the State government to inform it within a week how much time was required to appoint the chairperson for State Women Commission.

Hearing a PIL plea, a division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said statutory bodies like Women Commission should not be left without chairpersons. It directed Advocate-General B.S. Prasad to inform the court when the government would appoint State Women Commission chairperson.

Regulapati Ramya Rao of Arepally in Karimnagar, who filed the petition, stated that since completion of the term of Tripurana Venkataratnam in July 2018, no person was appointed in the post. She contended that 45 complaints were pending before the Commission but the government had not taken any steps to fill up the chairperson post.

As a result, the complainants were deprived of justice for long. She said that even National Women Commission chairperson Rekha Sharma took up the matter with Telangana Chief Secretary. Yet no action was taken so far, she stated.

Online classes in Urdu

In another PIL petition, the bench sought to know from the AG as to why the government had not taken steps to conduct online classes for school students in Urdu. Hearing the plea filed by a citizen Md. Abdul Sami, the bench observed that online classes to Urdu medium students should be conducted in Urdu only.

Mr. Sami, in his petition, stated that there was no mention of Urdu medium in the circular relating to online classes issued by School Education Commissioner.

259,2020/10/05,"Apex Council meeting on TS, AP water issues today","KCR, Jagan and top officials of Ministry of Jal Shakti to attend

The second meeting of the Apex Council on issues of water resources between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana States will be held virtually on Tuesday.

To be chaired by Union Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the meeting will be attended by two other Members of the Council – Chief Ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, respectively, and higher officials of the Ministry of Jal Shakti and of the two member States.

First meeting of the Apex Council, constituted under the provisions of AP Reorganisation Act after bifurcation of combined AP into AP and Telangana, was held on September 21, 2016. Although no breakthrough was made on water disputes between the two States at the first meeting the Council did not meet again until it was planned to be held on August 5 this year following AP’s decision to take up Rayalaseema Lift Scheme and to expand Pothireddypadu Head Regulator to divert nearly 8 tmc ft of Krishna water a day from Srisailam reservoir.

However, it could not be held as Telangana Chief Minister expressed his inability to participate in the meet on August 5 due to his prior engagements. Later it was scheduled to be held on August 25 but it did not materialise on that day too after the Union Minister tested positive for Covid-19.

With the major issue of water share between the two States pending before the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal and in the Supreme Court, the Apex Council, according to officials, would focus on the management of water allotted to combined AP by the Tribunals headed by R.S. Bachawat both in the Krishna and Godavari Basins with region wise allotment of water. The dispute over water share and projects between Telangana and AP has come into focus since bifurcation of combined AP.

Issues such as finalisation of working manual for the Krishna and Godavari River Management Boards – KRMB and GRMB, operational issues, allocation of funds, installation of telemetry equipment and sharing of detailed project reports pertaining to new projects. Although the complaints against each other by the two States including the AP’s plans to divert 8 tmc ft of Krishna water every day and AP’s objections to Telangana’s new projects on Godavari are not part of the agenda, they are expected to be raised by the Member States.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao has recently addressed a 14-page letter to MoJS explaining how injustice was being done to Telangana from the beginning on the issue of river water sharing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2d2inq/article32776205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06GAJENDR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/apex-council-meeting-on-ts-ap-water-issues-today/article32776206.ece
260,2020/10/05,Dr. Reddy’s Labs commits to reduce GHG emissions by 55%,"Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% in ten years. The pharma major said this on Monday while announcing that it has joined the Science Based Targets initiatives.

A joint initiative of Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), World Resources Institutes (WRI) and World Wide Fund (WWF), SBTi provides companies with a defined pathway to future-proof growth by specifying how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels.

Dr. Reddy’s is the first Indian and the third Asian pharmaceutical company to have set its Science-Based Targets to further minimise environmental impact, a release from the drugmaker said. The company has committed to reducing its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 from a FY2017-18 base year, which are in line with the latest climate science of limiting global warming to below 1.5 °c above pre-industrial levels, the release said.

Co-chairman and Managing Director G.V.Prasad said, “Continuous improvement in our environmental performance is a notable aspect of our sustainability journey. We are delighted to join SBTi in taking a science-based approach to set our GHG emission reduction targets and accelerating our efforts to creating a positive impact on our planet.”

As of 2019-20, Dr. Reddy’s has reduced its Scope 1 emissions by 8.6% and Scope 2 emissions by 20.7% over the baseline (2017-18). The combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been reduced by 13% over the same base year, putting it on a fast track to achieving GHG reduction targets, the release said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dr-reddys-labs-commits-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-by-55/article32776011.ece
261,2020/10/05,Bathukamma sarees distribution in Karimnagar,"Collector Konduru Shashanka directs the officials to complete the task by October 15

With the State government fast-forwarding the distribution of Bathukamma sarees, festive mood has set in the Karimnagar district.

District Collector Konduru Shashanka on Monday directed the officials to distribute the sarees before October 15, following all the guidelines related to COVID-19. He instructed the officials to constitute teams comprising panchayat secretary, self-help groups and fair price shop dealers, who will take up the task of distributing the sarees at the doorsteps of the beneficiaries in the villages.

In Karimnagar town and surrounding municipalities the saree will be distributed in coordination with concerned ward members, bill collectors, self-help groups and ration shop dealers. The officials have been told to stick to the stipulated time-frame and ensure that all the eligible beneficiary women receive the sarees ahead of the nine-day Bathukamma festival, which will commence on October 16.

Mr. Konduru said that this year they will distribute over 3.10 lakh Bathukamma sarees in the district. “On October 9, 10 and 11, the sarees will be delivered at the doorstep of the beneficiaries due to COVID-19 pandemic and after October 12, the women can get the sarees from nearby fair price shops,” he said, adding that concerned officials must wear masks and use hand sanitisers while taking part in the distribution. Irrespective of the caste and religion, women aged 18 years and above and belonging to Below Poverty Line families are eligible for Bathukamma sarees and people must get benefited by the government’s initiative, the Collector said.

He further requested the beneficiary women to carry their food security card, Aadhaar card or any identification card to avail the scheme without any hassle. With IT and Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao personally overseeing the distribution of handloom sarees weaved at Sircilla, Warangal and Karimnagar, officials across the State are on the high drive to meet the deadline. Distribution of sarees in implicate patterns and myriad colours has become a ritual among the women folk in the State, as many wait eagerly to get to experience the ‘gift’ of the State.

This year, the government had spent ₹ 317.81 crore to produce 91 lakh sarees of 6.30 metres each and another eight lakh sarees of 9 metres length in 287 designs and colours to satisfy the choice of all women. The nine-metre sarees are worn by elderly women, especially in the districts of north Telangana.

Last year, the State spent ₹313 crore on the production of Bathukamma sarees.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/k577sn/article32775976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy05Colle,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bathukamma-sarees-distribution-in-karimnagar/article32775977.ece
262,2020/10/05,Enumeration of properties underway in Hunwada mandal,"There are nearly 12,600 households spread over 35 gram panchayats

Collection of details in the morning, confirmation of facts during the night.

That is the system adopted by Hunwada mandal authorities in Mahabubnagar district to execute the task of enumerating details of properties for updating records in Dharani portal. Three days ago, when the teams of village panchayat secretary and multi-purpose workers turned up at the villages in the morning, not many people were available at their homes.

“Majority of the villagers are going to crop field works in the mornings. This made our job of collecting information difficult,” Hunwada Mandal Parishad Development Officer (MPDO) Natraj said. The work of collecting details of properties cannot be postponed. After racking up their brains on the way forward, they decided to knock the doors of the villagers in the evening even if it meant disturbing them after backbreaking work in the fields. This helped them in two ways. The teams began visiting the houses in the morning and collecting details of all properties with the persons available there. Later, in the evenings they are going back to the houses for confirmation of the facts and figures they had collected in the morning. This also instilled an element of trust in the villagers.

“Since each fact has to be cross-checked, sometimes the work was going till late in the night. At the end, it is yielding positive results,” the MPDO said. There are nearly 12,600 households spread over 35 gram panchayats in the mandal. So far they could contact 2,600 households and verify details of different properties.

In Vepuru village of the mandal, located 110 km away from State capital, there are 971 households. Already, information of 205 of them was gathered and cross-checked with the members of the families during interactions in the night. Along with the multi-purpose workers, even youngsters in the villages were coming forward voluntarily to assist them in ascertaining facts, the MPDO said.

He too is going around the villages to oversee progress of the work during the nights. Mahbubnagar district Collector S. Venkat Rao hopes, at this pace, enumeration of properties would be completed on time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/owhoad/article32775949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy05Enumeration,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/enumeration-of-properties-underway-in-hunwada-mandal/article32775950.ece

264,2020/10/05,Ballot voting for GHMC polls,"Decision taken after eliciting views of parties

The State Election Commission has resolved to conduct the forthcoming elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and other left-over urban local bodies with ballot boxes and ballot paper.

The decision was reportedly taken in view of the prevailing COVID pandemic after eliciting views from political parties. The SEC, after a meeting with the GHMC commissioner on the conduct of the elections, sought opinion of political parties on the issue and a majority of the parties favoured the conduct of the elections through ballot boxes.

The SEC said of the 50 political parties, including the 11 recognised parties, 16 favoured ballot boxes and three suggested use of Electronic Voting Machines while seven other parties did not give a definite opinion on the matter. Moreover, the use of EVMs involves several stages before their installation in the polling stations.

The EVMs should undergo first-level and second-level checks, randomisation and commissioning. At all these stages, huge number of engineers deputed by manufacturers, representatives of political parties and election staff would be involved. In addition, huge number of unskilled labour would be deployed for cleaning, unpacking and packing of the EVMs and VVPATs in a closed environment.

This could in turn involve high risk of community spread of COVID as compared with the use of ballot boxes. The State Election Commission on its part requested the ECIL and the BEL to send quotations for procurement of VVPATs.

These companies informed that they would require the permission of the Election Commission of India for manufacturing VVPATs. A letter had accordingly been addressed to the ECI seeking its permission and a reply is awaited. The SEC recalled that the elections to gram panchayats and MPTC/ZPTC polls last year, as well as elections to the ULBs, were conducted through ballot boxes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ballot-voting-for-ghmc-polls/article32775451.ece

Instead of buying a saree or something else on Dasara and Deepavali, gift your loved ones, who are 40 years or older, a mammography screening — this was the message by Ushalakshmi, founder chairman of the Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation.

An 87-year-old breast cancer survivor, Dr Ushalakshmi said that early detection of breast cancer can save lives. October is considered to be the International Breast Cancer Awareness month across the world.

The initiative of illuminating buildings in pink was taken up by the foundation.

The oration on the topic ‘Breast Cancer advocacy, screening and early detection of breast cancer’ was delivered by former Union Health Secretary K. Sujatha Rao. She said that breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in India.

“If diagnosed early and treated early, many lives can be saved. It is for this reason that government is focusing on raising awareness, early screening and diagnosis among women,” she said, adding that India needs to step up the number of oncologists from the current 1,250, radiographers, and other allied specialities, and upskill physicians, and nurses working in district hospitals and primary health care centres.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bkbyez/article32767945.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy04Gov,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/gift-mammo-screening-to-women-rather-than-sarees/article32767939.ece

Leaders of several Backward Classes associations led by R. Krishnaiah, president of the National BC Welfare Association, on Saturday requested Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy to take up enumeration of BC communities as part of the forthcoming Census exercise.

The delegation called on the Union Minister here and explained him about the necessity of community-wise enumeration of BCs as part of the Census.

Mr. Krishnaiah reminded that it was due to BJP’s pressure the Congress-led government at the Centre had agreed to enumerate BC communities in 2010. In 2018, a meeting on Census chaired by the then Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh too had decided to take up enumeration of BC communities as part of the Census.

Mr. Krishnaiah sought to know why there was the change in the Centre’s decision on community-wise enumeration of BCs after the BJP returned to power in 2019. He also brought to Mr. Kishan Reddy’s notice the Supreme Court judgment wherein it was directed to take up enumeration of BCs community-wise. Later too, both the Supreme Court and several High Courts had reiterated the view for taking up community-wise enumeration of BCs.

The BC bodies leaders later stated that Mr. Kishan Reddy had assured them that the BJP government at the Centre is ready for community-wise enumeration of BCs as part of the Census and a decision would be taken after discussing the matter with the ministry concerned.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bc-leaders-urge-kishan-for-caste-wise-enumeration/article32767719.ece

Meanwhile, the BJP State party office suddenly sacked Karimnagar BJP district president Basa Satyanarayana. He was replaced by Krishna Reddy of Huzurabad.

Though no reasons were explained by BJP for sacking Basa Satyanarayana, it strengthened the suspicions that the man in video clip was possibly him. Even as this became an embarrassment to BJP leaders, Bhavitha made even more startling allegations on Saturday. She claimed that she had been in live-in relationship with Basa for over a year.

She charged that she complained to BJP state president Bandi Sanjay about Satyanarayana. Bhavitha also alleged that Mr. Sanjay’s close associate K. Murali used to come to her house in Karimnagar with a woman BJP worker and indulge in immoral activities. Mr. Sanjay, who is also Karimnagar Member of Parliament and presently in Delhi, told The Hindu over phone that he would not spare any party worker indulging in illegal activities. He cautioned party workers and leaders to ensure party’s image is not damaged by their personal actions. Interestingly, by Sunday evening, pictures of Bhavitha with ruling TRS party began getting circulated in social media.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/twist-to-womans-allegations-on-bjp-leaders/article32767666.ece
275,2020/10/05,In the master’s voice,"Madurai’s musical troupes of the 1980s thrived on SPB songs. Apart from entertaining people, it helped the artists earn a decent living

Four decades ago, the temple town of Madurai saw several local and small orchestras create big waves. With limited entertainment options available in the region, the musical troupes grabbed the spotlight at political rallies, wedding receptions, annual religious festivals and temple functions.

There were at least two dozen bands, according to J S M Jeevanraj, who toured southern Tamil Nadu extensively. While a few, including his Jeevan Superstars Musical Troupe, were the most in demand, the other bands got a lot of play too. “The common thread that made each troupe’s music worth the attention was the legendary singer S P Balasubrahmanyam,” he says adding, “We were like the poor man's SPB doling out his songs with joy for all those who could not attend the maestro's concerts.”

The city's old timers recall that SPB spent time discussing music with many Madurai youngsters who had a passion for music. While SPB sailed through stage shows with consummate elegance, there were others who lived off his popularity and created a niche in the cultural landscape.

Weaving magic

S K Subramanian, reminisces the day he faced the Selection board of Pandyan Roadways Corporation, for a job under sports and extra-curricular activities quota. “During the interview I was asked to prove my talent and I sang Sankarabharanam. It not only got me the job but I also became the lead singer of PRC's 25-member orchestra team, ” says the 64-year-old, adding that he will always be grateful to SPB as he continues to live off his genius and draw a Government pension. “Unfortunately, the one who touched so many lives is gone. I wish it was me in his place,"" he says, his voice tinged with sadness.

The troupes played from the repertoire of MSV, Sankar Ganesh, Vidyasagar, Keeravani, Deva and Gangai Amaran as well but the late 1970s to mid-1990s was the time when SPB's voice and Illayaraja's compositions were immensely successful and the local orchestras could not escape this influence. “He was the new singing sensation and the uniqueness of the pair catapulted us to a new high as audiences loved hearing their songs,” says Subramanian.

Oliver, the bass guitarist with Jeevan Superstars, recalls that the money came in easily those days; orchestras were paid between ₹2,000-₹3,000 per show depending on the troupe's popularity, the event's importance and the playlist. “The team members earned between ₹ 50 to ₹250 each per show and in the later years it went up to ₹3,000 each per show.” Lead singers earned the highest followed by the guitarist; key board and the rhythm pad player were treated on par. The rest of the team’s pay was equal.

Several orchestra members met SPB in January when he came to Madurai for what turned out to be his last live programme. “It was SPB's humility and habit to meet old friends, relive old conversations and appreciate and encourage novices and amateurs in whom he sensed passion,” says Subramanian.

Into oblivion

The musical troupes started fading by the mid-90s with the advent of new age recording systems and advanced technology-driven sound-and-light shows. SPB often helped the teams with fund raising programmes and addressed their election meetings.

Jeevanraj remembers his first show in 1982 when he and his nine-member team set the stage on fire with Engeyum Eppodhum from Ninaithale Inikkum in 1982. Invitations to play SPB songs still come to him and he informs he is booked for two functions this month.

""I can't believe that SPB is gone. To nobodies like us, he was a friend, mentor and guide. There was always so much to learn from him,"" says the 59-year-old drummer.

The subtle tutor

Oliver says he started with Western music but changed his genre inspired by SPB’s light music. “It was pure pleasure playing SPB songs and wherever we took them, we were showered with love and applause. SPB endeared himself to us and us to the audiences. Such was the magic of his voice and power of his presence,” he adds.

Despite his stature, SPB was gentle and sans ego, says Chella Muthiah, the owner of Dindigul-based Angu Ingu the highest paid orchestra in the region today. Irrespective of age, expertise or knowledge, SPB treated every orchestra member equally, he says. “I had enjoyable sessions with him talking about everything from folk and choir music to rock and roll, Bach and Beethoven.”

The versatile, SPB smoked up a stage with his singing that teased, moaned, roared, laughed and yodelled. “To watch SPB perform was a musical delight and to learn from him was a blessing,” says Oliver. Orchestras of the time such as White Rose, Skylark, Challengers, Red Rose, Bluebird, Friends of Melody gained from SPB's knack of spotting and nurturing talent. “He subtly taught us the finer nuances of music,” says Subramanian. “His loss is a blow worse than the pandemic.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bt1tk5/article32774743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPB-a,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/madurais-musical-troupes-of-the-1980s-thrived-on-spb-tracks/article32774744.ece
276,2020/10/05,Shor Police sing in Czech,"Clinton Cerejo and Bianca Gomes get out of their comfort zone to challenge themselves

The pop band Shor Police formed by Bollywood composer, producer Clinton Cerejo along with singer-songwriter Bianca Gomes has had a lot happening during the lockdown. Shortly after their debut live performance at the new Berklee College of Music in Abu Dhabi, they have been busy in the studio working on brand projects and also their independent releases.

Shor Police has been approached for a very prestigious project led by Mirek Vana, (head of Global Development, Berklee College of Music). To promote an online international music competition for participants from East Europe and Slavic countries, they were asked to recreate a famous national Czech song. Their version of the Hussite Choral was appreciated by the mayor of Tabor who wrote a letter of appreciation to the artists for their contribution to this global project.

Sharing his thoughts on this association, Clinton Cerejo says, “We are extremely honoured to be creating our version of this Czech song along with other versions created by the likes of prog-rock guru Jordan Rudess (‘Dream Theater’), Grammy award-winning producer Olle Romo (Muse, Eurythmics) legendary jazz pianist Kenny Werner and a whole host of other renowned artists.”

Added Bianca: “Singing in Czech was certainly not easy and both Clinton and I took diction lessons on Zoom before recording the song.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/o1yn08/article32773071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym06shor-policejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/shor-police-sing-in-czech/article32773072.ece
277,2020/10/05,Cochin Port trade unions call for review of licence agreement with container terminal operator,"They allege that ₹2,000-crore investment for providing basic infrastructure for container terminal has not served its purpose

The Cochin Port Joint Trade Union Forum, comprising trade unions of different political affiliations at the Kochi port, has called for a review of the licence agreement between the Port Trust and operator of the Vallarpadam International Container Transshipment Terminal.

In a submission made before the Union Shipping Ministry, the trade union forum said that the licence agreement of January 31, 2005, between the Board of Trustees of Cochin Port and India Gateway Terminal Private Limited (IGTPL) needed to be subjected to a “meticulous review” and suitable clauses needed to be inserted into the agreement to ensure the financial stability of the port.

The licence agreement between IGTPL and the Cochin Port Trust was different from other build-operate-transfer (BOT) agreements as there was no minimum guaranteed throughput in the agreement, the trade union said in its representation to the government.

The Cochin Port Trust ended operations of the Rajiv Gandhi Container Terminal with 1.68 lakh TEUs of throughput in 2011 when the Vallarpadam terminal was commissioned. However, the public investment of around ₹2,000 crore for providing basic infrastructure for the container terminal had not served its purpose, the unions alleged.

The investments went into providing four-lane road connectivity, a rail link between Kalamassery and the terminal on Vallarpadam island as well as dredging operations for maintaining the draft for large vessels.

Around ₹1,900 crore was invested in infrastructure and around ₹125 crore was used in capital dredging operations. However, the utilisation of these facilities has been nominal. Though the terminal can handle around 12 lakh TEUs of cargo annually, its capacity utilisation is around 50% only. The terminal handled 6.2 lakh TEUs in 2019-20 after 15 years of being in operation, the unions said.

At the same time, the terminal operator had initiated arbitration proceedings against the Cochin Port Trust alleging delay in providing four-lane road facility as part of its efforts to get the licence period extended, the trade unions alleged.

The overall utilisation of facilities such as national highway and rail connectivity was around 35% of the capacity, the unions said as they called on the government to intervene in the matter.

The unions demanded that IGTPL should be made to develop the Vallarpadam terminal as a container transshipment terminal hub as envisaged in the licence agreement, failing which termination of the agreement should be effected and the facility taken over by the Cochin Port Trust.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/80bzhj/article32780279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05KI-VALLARPADAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cochin-port-trade-unions-call-for-review-of-licence-agreement-with-container-terminal-operator/article32774384.ece
278,2020/10/05,Farmers welcome move to quash field auctions,"‘Shrimp culture lobby trying to sabotage rice cultivation’

Farmers under the aegis of Pokkali Samrakshana Samiti welcomed a decision by the district administration to quash the auction of pokkali rice fields in Maruvakkad at Chellanam panchayat for shrimp culture for the ensuing season.

The auction of the rice fields broke the crop calendar and was done in violation of the COVID-19 lockdown, said the district administration on a complaint by Chanthu Manjadiparambil, a pokkali farmer who filed a complaint with the district administration.

Pokkali fields are cultivated in a fish-and-rice cycle in which the rice cultivation is taken up between May 15 and November 15, tapping the summer sun for field preparations and monsoon rain for the growth of paddy saplings.

However, less than four acres of the 260 cultivable acres in Maruvakkad wereḥ brought under sowing this season because of the delay in field preparations, which should have begun in the middle of May, said Francis Kalathungal of Pokkali Samrkashana Samiti. There are a total of 420 acres of pokkali fields in the Mavuvakkad paddy collective.

He welcomed the decision by the district administration as the shrimp culture lobby had been consistently trying to sabotage rice cultivation, he alleged. “Only less than 10 acres of the pokkali fields have been brought under sowing over the past decade for various reasons,” he added.

He also alleged that the Paadashekhara Samiti had been trying to ‘harass’ pokkali farmers in order to carry out shrimp culture throughout the year.

He said that the rice season in 2020 was lost because the fields could not be drained from April 15 as the fish culture prolonged.

The tension between pokkali rice farmers and fish farmers had been a long-running one and Mr. Kalathungal said it was the first time that the district administration was acting directly to intervene in the matter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pry7ld/article28070265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17KI-SHRIMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/farmers-welcome-move-to-quash-field-auctions/article32768496.ece
279,2020/10/05,Special centres for migrant students in Ernakulam to turn operational,"It is an initiative of Samagra Shiksha Kerala to help children with their online learning

Come Monday, 30 special training centres primarily to help migrant students with their online learning will turn operational across the district under an out-of-school education initiative of Samagra Shiksha Kerala (SSK).

The centres will come up in areas with migrant-intense populations like Aluva, Perumbavoor, Moovattupuzha, Kolancherry, Koovappady and Kothamangalam. Libraries, clubs, halls and anganawadis easily accessible to migrant communities and having the necessary infrastructure to facilitate online learning will serve as training centres.

“As per a survey, there are around 939 students, predominantly migrants, who may have access to online learning through Victers channel but still need the assistance of such special centres since their families are not in a position to help them with their studies. School dropouts, children who never got enrolled among the local populace, including tribal communities, will also be covered under the project,” said Usha Manatt, district project coordinator, SSK.

Nearly ₹55 lakh has been earmarked for the project in the district, which will cover the expenses of setting up basic infrastructure like televisions and projectors where needed, monthly salary of education volunteers and refreshments and conveyance of participants.

The centres will be run in the present makeshift arrangement only till the reopening of schools after which all the 30 centres will be coopted into as many schools where fixed hours will be allocated either before or after school hours or during weekends.

“The plan is to conduct sessions five days a week at different timings between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. for batches belonging to classes from 1 to 12 to maintain physical-distancing and COVID protocol. EVs (Education Volunteers) will be present at centres all through,” said P.B. Ratheesh, urban coordinator, SSK.

Multilingual EVs capable of switching between different languages to communicate effectively with migrant students have been roped in with the help of local bodies.

That EVs will be paid a monthly salary of ₹6,500 has come in handy for the likes of Thahira N.E, from Muvattupuzha who taught in an unaided college till about two years ago before the deteriorating health of her father forced her to quit. “Hopefully, there will be good participation in the sessions,” she said.

SSK hopes to conduct the programme in full steam for its beneficiaries notwithstanding the potential hurdles along the way in the form of containment zones and other pandemic-related restrictions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ht806g/article31762510.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/special-centres-for-migrant-students-in-ernakulam-to-turn-operational/article32768477.ece
280,2020/10/05,Ernakulam to have 237 toilets in public spaces,"‘Take a Break’ campaign to focus on renovating existing ones

In a collective effort involving the district administration, Suchitwa Mission and local bodies, 237 toilets are either to be newly constructed or renovated along the public spaces in the district under a campaign named ‘Take a Break.’

Under the project, eight toilets will be allotted within the corporation limits, five each in municipalities and two each in panchayats. Local bodies have been asked to submit images of facilities that could be renovated.

“The focus is on renovating existing ones into beautified and hygienic facilities. Local bodies can use Plan or own funds, finance commission grants, aid from MLA funds, and even use corporate social responsibility funds,” said P.H. Shine, assistant development commissioner and district coordinator, Suchitwa Mission, Ernakulam.

Though initially, the plan was to achieve the target by the end of this year, it may overshoot that time frame on account of the impending local body elections and the pandemic-related restrictions.

User fee

Since the proper upkeep of toilets have historically been the undoing of such projects, plans are afoot to rope in Kudumbashree for proper maintenance. Besides, different models in tune with local conditions and infrastructural feasibility are being explored alongside a user fee for making the facilities self-sustainable and ensuring their longevity.

One of the proposals is to rent out space for ATM counters or material collection facilities alongside toilets at places where spacious enough buildings could be found so that the rent covers operational expenses

Setting up stalls in association with Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam or stores for local products, thus creating a market space to bankroll the project is also being considered though nothing has been finalised yet. Depending on facilitating factors, some toilets will be scaled up to premium standards with feeding room, dressing room, sanitary napkin vending machines and even small eateries.

As inviting as the proposals maybe not to mention awards and certificates instituted for local body chairpersons, secretaries, and engineers coming up with the best facilities, not all local bodies seem overly excited. For instance, Aluva municipality which already has toilet complexes in the market and bus stand, though some of them have fallen into disrepair, said that it would not be easy to find space for new ones.

“The only potential locations are along the national highways for which we will have to secure permission from the National Highways Authority of India,” said Lissy Abraham, Aluva municipal chairperson.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ernakulam-to-have-237-toilets-in-public-spaces/article32768467.ece
281,2020/10/05,"Now, local COVID-19 testing for symptomatic persons to be done daily in Kochi","Asymptomatic people may choose private labs to get tested, says DMO

Till recently, COVID-19 testing at the community or primary health centre-level in local bodies would take place only once or twice a week and symptomatic persons might have been required to wait to get a test done at a government facility nearby. Now, district health officials have issued an order to conduct testing daily at the panchayat-level.

Daily testing at the local level would begin in about a week, said Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission.

Symptomatic people were required to report symptoms to the medical officer or health worker at the nearest government health centre, after which they would be given an appointment at a testing facility, said Dr. Numpeli. Walking into a government facility to get tested for COVID-19 on demand was neither allowed nor feasible since it could lead to a further spread of the disease, he added.

A doctor at the Ernakulam General Hospital said over 50 swabs were collected daily at the hospital — from symptomatic patients arriving at the casualty department and outpatient wing, patients being taken in for surgery and people identified as contacts of patients from Divisions 60 to 66 of the Kochi Corporation. The collection facility is manned by the hospital staff. Allowing people to walk in and get themselves tested at the hospital without prior intimation could prove to be unmanageable, the doctor said.

Getting symptomatic people tested had earlier been managed by the district’s COVID-19 control room. But in an attempt to decentralise and hasten the process, local bodies had been asked to inform residents of a local control room or health worker they could contact, said Dr. Numpeli.

Private facilities

People who suspect that they might have contracted the disease from a contact have resorted to private facilities to reassure themselves. After their acquaintance tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, a 39-year-old woman and her 47-year-old husband, residents of Pettah and both asymptomatic, got themselves tested at a private lab, where the woman tested positive. Ten days later, after a repeat test at a government facility, the man tested positive as well. “Since health officials might have asked us to wait 10 days before we get tested, we decided to get tested at a private lab to avoid that intervening period of anxiety,” said the man.

As per protocol, asymptomatic people are no longer tested even if they are high-risk primary contacts. If an asymptomatic person wanted a test done, they could choose a private lab, said District Medical Officer N.K. Kuttappan.

Walk-in kiosks

While the COVID-19 walk-in sample kiosk (WISK) was initially envisaged as a telephone booth-like facility where samples could easily be collected in case of a surge in caseload, problems of infection control could arise if they were set up in public places, said Nikhilesh Menon, nodal officer for COVID lab surveillance. The gloves and tunnel of the kiosk, that allows the health worker to collect the sample from behind a barrier, would have to be disinfected by a worker in PPE after each use. That, in addition to waste management, could be an issue in public spaces, he said.

Consequently, the kiosks have been placed in taluk hospitals, the two General Hospitals in the district, the Government Medical College Hospital, a few community health centres and first-line treatment centres, where they are being put to use to varying degrees.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/zg0w97/article32768451.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04KIAANTIBNODYTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/now-local-covid-19-testing-for-symptomatic-persons-to-be-done-daily/article32768452.ece
282,2020/10/05,Ernakulam has 25.34 lakh voters,"District records an increase of 1,55,112 voters from 2015 list

After removing the names of the deceased and those who moved out of the district during the last five years from the voters’ list and adding new voters, 25.34 lakh voters have found place in the latest electoral roll for Ernakulam.

The district witnessed an increase of 1,55,112 voters since the finalisation of the 2015 list, which was used as the base document for the civic polls during the year. Ernakulam had 23,79,087 voters as per the 2015 list.

The 2020 electoral roll, which was released by the State Election Commission on October 1, will serve as the voters’ list for the local body polls likely to be held by the year-end.

The new list has 12,29,057 male voters and 13,05,107 female voters and 35 others on the rolls. Ernakulam comes in the fourth position in terms of the total number of voters as Malappuram topped the list with 32,83,647 voters followed by Thiruvananthapuram (27,69,252) and Thrissur (26,54,699).

The scrutiny witnessed 1,19,765 voters going out of the list in the district, which included 1,57,164 men, 62,598 women and three others. At the same time, 80,434 men, 99,103 women and 10 others found place in the revised list as political parties and prospective candidates worked overtime to enrol voters.

Chance to enrol

The total number of voters may undergo minor changes as people will be given one more opportunity to enrol themselves just before the local body elections. The Commission will also provide another opportunity for filing complaints regarding the entries or deletion in the list before the elections.

The 2015 elections had 3,104 polling stations in the district. Of this, 748 were in urban areas and 2,356 in rural areas. The number of polling stations may be increased, considering the increase in the number of voters. The electoral roll would be made available to political parties before October 15, according to a communication from the Commission.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ernakulam-has-2534-lakh-voters/article32768423.ece
283,2020/10/05,Not many takers for QR code-based visitor registration system in Ernakulam,"Most commercial establishments in district continue to use handwritten registers

While a QR code-based visitors’ registration system is available on the State government’s COVID-19 Jagratha portal as an alternative to the manual recording of visitor details at shops and other establishments to help with tracing contacts of patients, most commercial establishments in the district continue to use handwritten registers.

The shop or establishment will have to be registered on the Jagratha portal to get a specific QR code generated. A copy of the code can then be placed at the entry.

Scanning the QR code on entry redirects the customer to the Jagratha portal, where they are required to enter name, phone number, address and the local body limits in which they stay. Some establishments like a large supermarket chain with a few branches across the district have both the QR code displayed and a register where customer details are manually entered by the guard at the entrance. The QR code system relies on the customer entering all details into the portal themselves.

The manager of a supermarket in the Ernakulam South area said they had retained the manual register system. “We have customers who might not possess a smartphone. A QR code system is not entirely practical,” he said.

Staff at a bakery at Thykoodam and a clothing store near Kadavanthra also said that customer contact details were being collected manually. Since they were only allowing a limited number of customers into the store at a time, recording their details manually was not a hassle, the manager at the clothing store said.

A senior health official in the district, however, remained sceptical about the use of such a system. “In the contact tracing process, factors like how close somebody was to a patient, whether they were both wearing masks, and the amount of time the two people might have spent in contact, are important. Entering a shop or establishment need not make somebody a contact and collecting all that information might not really be useful,” he said.

A directive from the Health and Family Welfare Department had, last month, suggested that the QR code system be implemented in establishments functioning under the department. The directive had noted that the system could be implemented in government institutions and other establishments.

The district chapter of the Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association had organised its own QR code-based system that was in use in about 90% of the 3,500-odd restaurants part of the association for over a month now, said Azeez Musa, president of the Ernakulam chapter. The data was stored on the association’s server, but they had not had any reason to retrieve it so far, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/not-many-takers-for-qr-code-based-visitor-registration-system-in-ernakulam/article32768418.ece
284,2020/10/05,Unions launch protest against privatisation of port,"Government urged to reconsider licence agreement with ICTT

The Cochin Port Joint Trade Union Forum has launched an indefinite relay hunger strike in front of the port head office here against the Centre’s move to privatise the port and switch to the land model of business operations.

In a statement, the forum, comprising all trade unions, said the government should not pass the Major Port Trust Authority Act, 2020.

It demanded that the government reconsider the conditions in the licence agreement with the operator of the International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT) at Vallarpadam. The conditions should be rewritten in keeping with the interests of the port, the forum said.

The trade unions expressed the view that the expenses for dredging the shipping channel for the Kochi port should be shared by the Cochin Shipyard and the Indian Navy, so that the burden did not fall exclusively on the port trust.

They also said that the smooth operations of the port should be ensured by appointing personnel to vacant posts and streamlining operations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/unions-launch-protest-against-privatisation-of-port/article32768341.ece
285,2020/10/05,Traffic regulations in place at Palarivattom,"DMRC-sponsored personnel to regulate vehicles and ensure pedestrians’ safety at junction

Traffic regulations were introduced at the NH Bypass Junction at Palarivattom on Sunday, as part of which the crossing along Civil Line Road was barricaded, and vehicles along the road were diverted through U-turns that were created on either side of the flyover.

With Sunday being a lean day and curbs on people gathering in public places, traffic was minimal through the junction. “More number of vehicles are expected on Monday, when the junction generally encounters snarls. Vehicles in the east-west direction will thus take a left turn and cross over to the other side through newly-built U-turns on either side of the flyover. They need to travel only 350 metres extra on each side. Over 30-metre wide U-turns, each capable of accommodating vehicles in multiple rows, have been carved out on either side of the flyover. Vehicles will have to use this facility till the flyover is rebuilt,” said Francis Shelby, Assistant Commissioner of Police, City Traffic Police (East).

The advantages of having two U-turns, 700 metres from each other, are many. Commuters will face minimum inconvenience, while monitoring traffic will be easy. Around a dozen personnel, including four wardens sponsored by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), will be posted in and around the junction to regulate vehicles and to ensure the safety of pedestrians. Electronic signal lamps will be installed at both the U-turns, to regulate traffic coming from the NH Bypass and those taking U-turn. Their importance will go up during night. Adequate number of lights too will be installed at the two U-turns, to ensure visibility from a distance, the officer said.

On Sunday, barricades were erected beneath the central spans, to ensure safety of road users when the flyover is dismantled and rebuilt. Barricades have been installed beside the flyover too, wherever concrete crash barriers are being demolished. The DMRC has also set up sign boards to warn motorists to slow down, considering civil work over the flyover.

Potholes remain

In the meantime, potholes along potential traffic diversion roads like Vennala-Puthiya Road stretch have not being repaired by the Kochi Corporation. Encroachments by houses and shops abound on Puthiya Road and at Vennala High School Junction, obstructing traffic. The DMRC and Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS), the stakeholders engaged in reconstructing the flyover, will have to repair potholes on Civil Line Road and alternative roads, in case the PWD and the Kochi Corporation do not repair them.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/9s4j86/article32768208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05-KI-PALARIVATTOM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/traffic-regulations-in-place-at-palarivattom/article32768209.ece
286,2020/10/05,Man stabbed to death near Nedumbassery,"Suspected case of inter-gang rivalry

A man was allegedly stabbed to death at Kayyalapadi near Nedumbassery on Sunday morning, in what is suspected to be a case of inter-gang rivalry.

The victim, Jissmon, 36, of Thuravoor near Angamaly had been facing charges of drug peddling. The police suspect that he was murdered by members of a rival gang over narcotic trade. A hunt is on to trace history-sheeters associated with the trade. The Nedumbassery police have registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC.

Protocol violations

The Ernakulam Rural police have taken action against 39 shop owners for not adhering to the COVID-19 protocol. Special teams have been deployed in the district to keep tabs on protocol violators. District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthick said Section 144 would be strictly enforced. In Kochi city, a fine of ₹32,200 was collected in 161 cases by flying squads deputed by the District Collector.

Child porn case

287,2020/10/05,Short film ‘I am Enough’ deals with issue of self acceptance,"Psychologist turned filmmaker Sujatha Balakrishnan talks about ‘I Am Enough” which deals with comparison and the need for self validation

As children we were constantly being compared to siblings and peers; as adults we tend to measure ourselves against others around us. The ill-effects of constant comparison forms the premise of ‘I Am Enough’ a short film scripted by Sujatha Balakrishnan.

In her experience as a psychologist for over two decades, Sujatha Balakrishnan regularly comes across people dealing with issues of self-acceptance.

“I strongly believe our self evaluation is highly influenced by the validation of others. This in turns affects our self worth and self esteem,” says Sujatha Balakrishnan.

“This is especially true amongst adolescents who are in an idealistic crisis at that stage of their lives. They are constantly facing questions such as, ‘Who am I? What do people think of me?’”

A particularly intense case where a teenager developed strong feelings of dislike towards a person she was constantly being compared to, made Sujatha realise greater awareness was needed on the topic.

American social psychologist Leon Festinger, known for his Theory of Social Comparison, has been an influence on Sujatha’s professional life. “Leon Festinger believed that we engage in this comparison process as a way of establishing a benchmark by which we can make accurate evaluations of ourselves,” she says.

‘I Am Enough’ is the story of a promising young swimmer who is constantly being measured by the academic success of her best friend and the impact it has on their relationship as well as on the mental state of the protagonist herself. It also sheds light on how parents, teachers and peers unknowingly aggravate the mental trauma by not being more supportive.

The story and screenplay of ‘I Am Enough’ were written by Sujatha Balakrishnan and directed by Pooja Pandey Tripathi with Usha Rao handling the camera and editing. The short film took about two months to write and two weeks to film.

289,2020/10/05,East West Metro services in Kolkata extended to Phoolbagan,"With this, the city gets new underground Metro station after a gap of 25 years

The services of the East West Metro were on Sunday extended from Salt Lake to Phoolbagan in the heart of Kolkata. Phoolbagan is the first underground Metro station along the 16.55-km East West Metro route that will connect Howrah Maidan on the other bank of the river Hooghly to Newtown in the north eastern fringes of Kolkata.

With the resumption of Metro services in Phoolbagan, Kolkata gets a new underground Metro Station after a gap of 25 years.

The East West Metro was commissioned in 2008, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said during the virtual launch of the project, adding that very little work on the project was done before 2015, leading to “huge delay” and “cost escalation” of the project. “I am told that by the end of next year the entire project in the 16.55-km route will be completed,” Mr. Goyal said.

The first phase of the East West Metro station from Salt Lake’s Sector V to Salt Lake Stadium was opened on February 13, 2020. With the extension of services to Phoolbagan, the distance between Sector V and Phoolbagan can be travelled in 16 minutes which takes about an hour by road, said Manoj Joshi, general manager of Metro Railway. The services of East West Metro to Phoolbagan will be open for general passengers from October 5.

Two tunnels

What makes the East West Metro project unique is two tunnels running parallel to each other about 37 metre below the riverbed of Hooghly. The first underwater tunnels in the country which were completed in 2017 are considered an engineering marvel. Of the 16.55 km, about 10.88 km of the East West Metro will be underground.

Metro Railway officials say that once completed, the East West Metro will ferry about seven lakh to eight lakh passengers. Kolkata is the first city in the country to get Metro Railway as early in 1984 and the North South Metro Railway was ferrying about six lakh passengers on a weekday before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The services of Kolkata Metro were resumed last month and more than 50,000 passengers are availing Metro rides daily. Metro services are considered the lifeline of transport infrastructure of Kolkata which has the lowest road area when compared to other metropolises.

Trinamool’s charge

Meanwhile, the event, like the inauguration of the first phase of the East West Metro, witnessed allegations by the State’s ruling Trinamool Congress that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was not accorded due respect by not being invited to the event. State’s Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim said there would have been no Metro Railway in Kolkata without Ms. Banerjee.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/east-west-metro-services-in-kolkata-extended-to-phoolbagan/article32768301.ece
290,2020/10/05,Decline in fresh COVID-19 cases in Kozhikode,"641 test positive for SARS-CoV-2; six deaths reported from MCH

Fresh COVID-19 cases declined to 641 in Kozhikode district on Monday after continuously surging above a daily load of over 900 cases in the past few days.

According to the District Medical Officer, 584 of these are locally acquired infections. They include 139 people from within Kozhikode Corporation. The source of infection of 36 people is not known. There are 19 health workers among the newly infected. The number of active cases reached 9,829 of whom 5,830 are under home isolation.

Six deaths were reported from the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, on Sunday and Monday. Three of them, two from Kozhikode and one from Kasaragod, died on Sunday, the others, two from Kozhikode and one from Malappuram, died on Monday.

Market to reopen

Meanwhile, the Kozhikode Corporation has decided to reopen the Palayam market in the city from Tuesday. Its closure had hit the movement of fruits and vegetables in a big way though the market at Thadampattuthazham was designated for the purpose.

It was closed on September 23 after 233 people associated with the place were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, the authorities said restrictions would be imposed for entry. Of the eight entry points, four will be closed and the barricades would be under police control. The health wing would examine the body temperature of all those who enter the premises.

The corporation would have to provide ID cards to traders, porters, and other staff in the market who test negative for the virus and only such people should be allowed to work there. Stalls would be allowed to operate only after 11 a.m. and pushcart vendors too should reach the premises around the same time.

291,2020/10/05,‘More govt. hospitals needed to treat COVID-19 patients’,"Call to set up sufficient number of dialysis units and ICUs

With the number of active COVID-19 cases inching towards the 10,000-mark in Kozhikode, demand is rife to earmark more government hospitals for treatment in the district. There has also been a suggestion to set up more intensive care units (ICU) and start dialysis for infected persons at the hospitals.

Right now, the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) and the Government General Hospital alone are the designated facilities in the public sector for treating infected persons. Malabar Medical College Hospital, Ulliyeri; KMCT Medical College Hospital, Mukkom, and IQRAA International Hospital and Research Centre, Eranhipalam, are those chosen in the private sector where low-cost or free treatment is offered.

However, the number of new cases has been hovering around 1,000 in the past few days, and almost 3,000 people were found infected in the past three days alone.

A senior doctor at the MCH, who did not wish to be quoted, told The Hindu that more government hospitals would have to be designated for treating patients. Though the number of infected persons at the MCH and the General Hospital is only 325 and 280 respectively, those in need of critical care among them are less than 100. So, if at least some who are not in need of critical care can be provided treatment at other government hospitals, it will help the health apparatus to focus more on severely infected persons, he claimed.

“Also, another major area of concern among the infected population are people who have renal issues. Right now, only the MCH offers dialysis to them in the district. In view of the rise in the number of newly infected persons, more government hospitals should also have similar facilities,” he pointed out.

Another doctor at the hospital suggested that taluk hospitals and community health centres be opened up for COVID-19 treatment. They should also be equipped with ICUs. “A person with another health issue is tested positive for the virus and admitted to the MCH. Within a couple of days, the patient’s condition may become better. Such people could be sent to nearby government facilities where their condition could be monitored regularly,” he said. According to him, apart from treatment, a few infected persons may need personal attention and care. If the number of patients goes up at the MCH, providing it could be difficult, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/more-govt-hospitals-needed-to-treat-covid-19-patients/article32768229.ece

293,2020/10/05,"SP, wife hand over relief to tribal families","When the residents of Kalaimaan Nagar, situated near Karuppanadhi Dam deep inside the jungles of the Western Ghats beyond Chokkampatti saw a couple of police vehicles entering their colony on Monday, they were bewildered as nothing happened untoward there.

The residents, all Paliyar Scheduled Tribes, could not understand the reason behind the sudden entry of police into their hamlet.

When they saw Superintendent of Police Suguna Singh and his wife Dhanalakshmi getting down from the vehicle with a friendly smile, they were relieved.

“We have come to meet you, especially your children,” Mr. Singh told the residents of Kalaimaan Nagar, housing 22 tribal families with 137 members comprising 74 men, 63 women including four pregnant women.

The purpose behind the top cop’s visit to the jungles along with his wife was to meet the tribal people living deep inside the forest and help them with the contributions mobilised by the IPS Officers Wives’ Association (IPSOWA) – Tamil Nadu and Tenkasi District Police.

On seeing the friendly policemen, the men and women started gathering at a point and Ms. Dhanalakshmi handed over bedsheets and other essential commodities, jointly sponsored by IPSOWA – Tamil Nadu and Tenkasi District Police.

“On behalf of the IPSOWA, we gave the tribal people blanket and grocery. If this small contribution of IPSOWA may bring them happiness, it is the happiest moment for all of us,” Ms. Dhanalakshmi said.

When the officials went to Kalaimaan Nagar, connected by badly damaged road, to distribute relief material after COVID-19 outbreak, none could be seen in their houses as the tribes had already shifted their families to the deepest parts of the forest fearing the pandemic.

After a lot of hesitation, they returned to Kalaimaan Nagar where they were housed in Public Works Department building as their houses were under construction.

After Collector G.K. Arun Sundar Thayalan saw their pathetic condition, he ordered construction of 22 green houses for them after removing the dilapidated structures in which they were living.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/vipi44/article32776360.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA06-OFFICER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/sp-wife-hand-over-relief-to-tribal-families/article32776361.ece
294,2020/10/05,Farmers’ association extends support to Palaniswami’s candidature to CM post,"Even as the weekly grievance redressal meet was under way at the Collectorate on Monday, a group of farmers affiliated to Vijayanarayanam Irrigation Tank Farmers’ Association staged demonstration in support of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s candidature for the same post for next Assembly elections.

Led by association president R. Murugan, they raised slogans in support of Mr. Palaniswami.

They said the Chief Minister, who was executing kudimaramaththu works for desilting irrigation tanks and supply channels for the past three years, had revived farming operations in areas that remained uncultivable for several decades due to want of water.

The desilted tanks and supply channels, with increased storage of water, had expanded the area of cultivation.

“It has led to increase in farmers’ income. Hence, Mr. Palaniswami should be the next Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,” said Mr. Murugan.

A petition submitted submitted by a group of people from Thiruvalluvar Nagar in Pettai appealed to the Collector to allow them to use a common path in their area.

They said residents, who were living in Thiruvalluvar Nagar since 1972, were using a common path adjacent to the Government Industrial Training Institute for the past 48 years.

Even after they constructed a temple in their colony in 1982, a section of residents used the common path to reach the place of worship without any resistance from any individual or an organization.

“Of late, the ITI administration claimed ownership of this common path after a compound wall was built around the institute. When the matter was challenged in court, we lost the legal battle.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi sought the report in a PIL petition filed by L. Seenivasakan from Tiruvengadam in Tenkasi district who alleged that the funds allotted for the scheme was being misused. The petitioner, an agriculturist, said a stream in Naranapuram village passed through two survey numbers and ended in Nirpidikulam kanmoi and people in the region used water from the stream for irrigation.

Under these circumstances, private parties had colluded with an Assistant Executive Engineer and obtained loan for setting up a water harvesting pond. This pond was set up by encroaching the stream, thereby affecting the flow of water to the kanmoi.

The scheme was misused and the funds wasted. A representation was sent to the authorities concerned to remove the encroachments, but till date no action had been taken, the petitioner said.

Justice G.R. Swaminathan stayed the licence after a Theni-based farmers’ association representative, T. Vijay Rajan, filed a petition with a complaint of water theft in the region. In his petition, he said the Cumbum valley had a long history of paddy cultivation. But, water, a precious resource was being monetised by unscrupulous persons, thus affecting supply of water for irrigation.

Due to water theft, the livelihood of ayacut farmers of Cumbum valley had been affected. They had been denied a second crop in three of the last seven years, despite good rainfall and sufficient water being released from Periyar dam. Many officials either directly or by refusing to act against the water theft have contributed to the sufferings of the farmers and there was a deliberate mismanagement of water.

Though several representations had been sent to the government to act against the culprits, the theft of water and illegal pumping of groundwater were continuing, affecting cultivation in the region.

The residents, who had given a petition to the Collector in this regard last week, came to the Collectorate on Monday to follow up on it. C. Jothi, one of the petitioners, said that for many decades the residents had been regularly pledging their jewellery in the pawn shop to meet their emergency financial needs. “Since most of us are daily wage earners, we pawn our jewellery and other valuables in the shop to pay school fee of our children or to meet emergency financial requirements,” he said.

Around 1,500 sovereigns of gold jewellery were looted from the shop in February 2019, said A. Meenakshi Sundaram, an auto-rickshaw driver. “There were no CCTV cameras in the shop and the owners had not taken other safety precautions,” he said.

Ahead of the northeast monsoon season that would intensify sowing of maize in Rajapalayam taluk, officials of Department of Agriculture have begun an awareness programme on the ways to control Fall Armyworm attack on the crop.

The district had faced crop loss after over 30,000 farmers cultivated maize on over 25,000 hectares in 2018.

The attack by the invasive pest was found in many districts across the State.

“With the recent rain reported in these parts of the district, farmers in various villages in the taluk have started sowing maize. So far, sowing had been taken up on some 300 hectares. We expect the sowing to go in full swing soon after the northeast monsoon sets in,” Agricultural Officer G. Dhanalakshmi said.

Maize coverage in the taluk is expected to be around 1,700 hectares in Rajapalayam taluk.

“We want to create awareness of the various ways of controlling the pest,” she said.

Joint Director (Agriculture) Uthandaraman and Assistant Director T. Subbiah (Rajapalayam) were present during the flagging off of an awareness vehicle.

The vehicle would go around the Maize-production villages like Melarajakularaman, S. Ramalingapuram, Solapuram, Gopalapuram, Vadakarai, Thenkarai, Korukkampatti and Nathampatti.

Ms. Dhanalakshmi said that the State Government would give ₹2,000 subsidy for every hectare for controlling Fall Armyworm in Maize.

The farmers would be given treated seeds and were advised to raise sunflower and gingelly as border crop and black gram and green gram as inter crop to control the pest.

Besides, after 20 days of raising the plants, the farmers have been advised to spray neem oil. They should also spray Metarhizium after 40 days.

The farmers need to spend on the pesticide and 50% subsidy for the pesticide would be deposited to their account.

Most of them had been driven out of their homes by property owners and lived on pavements, bus shelters and bus stands. Hence, the district administration should give them either free house sites or green houses being built for the rural poor by the government.

303,2020/10/05,Murder victim’s family seeks fair probe,"Family and relatives of a youth, who was murdered allegedly by his friends, submitted a petition in the Collector’s office here on Monday seeking comprehensive and unbiased probe into the crime.

They alleged that the murder was orchestrated because of enmity caused by the victim’s love with a girl from another community.

The body of Satish Kumar, 25, of Nallur near Alangulam was found in an isolated area near Naduvaikurichi under Palayamkottai Taluk Police Station limits on September 30. Even as a probe into the murder was on, the victim’s friends, Sudalai, Sudalaimuthu, Muthukumar and Chinnadurai, surrendered before the police and were subsequently arrested.

Police said an altercation, which broke out among the friends as they were consuming liquor, led to Satish Kumar’s murder. His family and relatives, however, accused the police of hiding the truth and came to the Collectorate to submit a petition seeking comprehensive probe into the murder.

They said Satish Kumar, who was working in Mumbai, returned to his native place after the pandemic. When he was in Mumbai, he loved a girl from Tirunelveli district. Since she belonged to another caste, her parents opposed it. Satish spoke to her over the phone after he returned to Nallur. Even as he was at Nallur, a group of youth, all belonging to the girl’s caste, befriended him and took him to their village under the pretext of hosting a dinner for him.

When Satish went there, he was murdered by them on instructions from the girl’s family and relatives. “It was a well-planned murder and not an attack unleashed on Satish following altercation among inebriated friends,” said the victim’s maternal uncle, Nityanandan.

A driver of a State Express Transport Corporation bus, Sankar, was killed and six passengers, including three women, were injured, when the bus rammed against a stationary truck on the Tiruchi-Madurai Highway in Melur in the early hours of Monday.

Police said that the driver of the bus, proceeding to Tirunelveli from Chennai, failed to notice the parked truck on the four-way highway. The bus hit the heavy vehicle from behind at around 2 a.m. Consequently, the driver was killed on the spot.

In the impact of the collision, the front portion of the bus was completely mangled and got entangled with the truck. Firemen from Melur, led by Station Fire Officer, P. Suresh Chandrakanth, struggled for nearly two hours to pull out the body of the driver. However, only after pressing into service a crane, could the vehicles be separated.

306,2020/10/05,"Old Kulur Bridge develops potholes, craters again","It had undergone structural strengthening a few months ago at a cost of ₹ 38 lakh

The Old Kulur Bridge that was closed for two months between March and May this year for structural strengthening has developed potholes and craters on its surface as well as approach roads.

Built in 1952, the bridge across the Phalguni (Gurupura) was found unfit for movement of heavy vehicles by the National Highways Authority of India. The bridge is on the Udupi-Mangaluru carriageway. While NHAI’s proposal to construct a new six-lane bridge to complement a six-lane highway on the stretch is yet to materialise, the authority had sought the district administration’s permission to close the Old Bridge to strengthen the structure.

Accordingly, the administration allowed the closure of the bridge from March 16 and diverted traffic on the New Bridge allowing two-way traffic.

With COVID-19 and the consequent lockdown, the Old Bridge was opened for traffic on May 20 by MP Nalin Kumar Kateel.

The NHAI had spent about ₹ 38 lakh to strengthen the expansion joints and replace bearings between girders and pillars while it said that the pillars were strong enough to carry vehicular traffic.

However, within months, the bitumen layer on the bridge surface has given way forming potholes and craters. The approach roads, from KIOCL Junction till the bridge and from the bridge till Kulur Flyover, too have developed potholes and craters.

Commenting on the sorry state of affairs, Raghuram, a regular commuter on the stretch, said that the NHAI would not have done better than leaving the potholes open on the bridge, if it wanted the bridge to get weakened with every passing vehicle.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/o9a8tf/article32776832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MNOLDKULURBRIDGE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/old-kulur-bridge-develops-potholes-craters-again/article32776835.ece

There are some illegal slaughterhouses in the district where cows are being slaughtered. The district administration has not taken the issue of illegal transportation and slaughtering of cows seriously.

Cows are even being illegally transported in expensive cars.

The forum will also redress grievances on bills and treatments availed of under Ayushman Bharat scheme in those hospitals.

The forum will be set up in the office of District Health and Family Welfare Officer.

Informing this at the Karnataka Development Programme Review Committee meeting here on Monday, Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said that people having grievances can approach the forum.

He said that the district administration will soon introduce a service wherein COVID-19 patients in homes will be shifted for free treatment at hospitals, in case they needed hospitalisation. They will be given free ambulance service from home to hospital and back home.

Minister in-charge of Dakshina Kannada Kota Srinivasa Poojary said that COVID-19 patients can avail themselves of free treatment under Ayushman Bharat scheme in 73 hospitals in Dakshina Kannada. Probably, Dakshina Kannada is the first district in the State to bring such maximum number of hospitals under Ayushman Bharat scheme for treating COVID-19 patients free, he added.

Sand bars

The Deputy Commissioner told the meting that sand bars for sand extraction under the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) in the district will be identified in the next 10 days. They will be finalised as per the guidelines of the government.

Land for roads

Mr. Rajendra said that village accountants or other officials concerned in gram panchayats will be suspended if they did not earmark and reserve land for public roads while granting land under any government scheme.

The Assistant Commissioners should conduct pension adalats in taluks within a fortnight to reddress the complaints of pensioners, he said.

The Deputy Commissioner asked MESCOM to set right issues in the delay of electricity bills reaching consumers in Bantwal and Belthangady taluks at the earliest.

Mangaluru Division of the Postal Department has come out with a Kannada booklet explaining how to do it all.

Minister in-charge of Dakshina Kannada Kota Srinivasa Poojary and Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel released the booklet here on Monday.

The 38-page booklet provides information on documents required for new enrolment, correction, change of name and date of birth and the like.

Speaking on the occasion, Senior Superintendent of Post Offices, Mangaluru Division, Shreeharsha N., said that seeding of Aadhaar number has assumed significance to avail of many government services. Hence, it should be kept up-to-date.

The booklet will not only help people but also staff members in Aadhaar centres to guide those in need on the documents required to enrol. It answers Frequently Asked Questions.

310,2020/10/05,NHAI told to fill all potholes on NH 75 within a fortnight,"Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra on Monday issued a warning to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) that criminal cases will be filed against it if potholes on National Highway 75 between BC Road and Adda Hole resulted in any death due to vehicular accidents.

Speaking at the Karnataka Development Programme Review Committee meeting, Mr. Rajendra, who is also the District Magistrate, said that cases will be filed under Section 304 A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

He asked the authority to fill all potholes on the stretch within a fortnight from now.

The Deputy Commissioner also instructed Mangaluru City Corporation and the Public Works Department (PWD) to fill potholes on their roads within a fortnight.

Minister in-charge of Dakshina Kannada Kota Srinivasa Poojary said that the condition of the highway stretch is such that many vehicles avoided the road between Periyashanti and BC Road on the highway and opted to travel via Dharmasthala, Ujire, Belthangady and BC Road. People have reached the state of losing hopes on the authority as it is not at all serious in filling potholes and is not bothered about the plight of the commuters, the Minister said.

In his reply, an official from the NHAI said that the authority has commenced the work to fill potholes as rain has receded. The works will be completed at the earliest, he added.

Underpass

Mangaluru MLA U.T. Khader urged the Minister and the city corporation to hasten the process of getting land for constructing a railway underpass at Mahakalipadpu in the city. As it required 1.5 acres of private land, the government should hold talks with the owners to get the land for the project under the provisions of TDR (transferable development rights) or premium FAR (floor area ratio).

A note on the matter tabled in the meeting said that the Chief Secretary has directed that of the ₹ 20 crore required for land acquisition for the project, 50 % should be borne by the government and the balance amount should be allotted by the city corporation.

Though the corporation has funds under the head of “premium FAR”, it cannot be diverted for acquiring land and it can be spent only for widening or developing a road. The matter has been placed before the council of the corporation to take an appropriate decision on diverting the fund from “premium FAR” account for acquiring the land for the project which will be taken up under the Smart City Mission.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/nhai-told-to-fill-all-potholes-on-nh-75-within-a-fortnight/article32774379.ece
311,2020/10/05,Protest staged against proposal to privatise power distribution,"The move will adversely affect the common man and farmers, says federation of electricity board staff union

Members of the Federation of the Karnataka Electricity Board Employees Union and Associations on Monday staged a demonstration in protest against the Union government’s move to privatise power distribution saying that it was detrimental to the interests of States and consumers.

Assembling in front of the corporate office of Mangalore Electricity Supply Company (MESCOM) here, the members said that the Union government was rushing through the proposal without due consultation with States even though electricity was a federal subject. Employees and officers of the distribution companies (DISCOMS) were valuable stakeholders of the system having toiled hard for the progress of the sector, they said.

In a statement, organising secretary of KPTCL Accounts Officers Association Muralidhara Nayak, vice-president of KEB Engineers Association Manjappa and vice-president of KPTCL Employees Association H.S. Gurumurthy said that power supply in the State has been a public service providing subsidised power to the poor and farmers. While Union Power Minister R.K. Singh promised in the July 3 meeting with State Power Ministers to place a modified draft soon, the Ministry on October 1 released the draft of the standard bidding guidelines without any consultation, they said.

The guidelines say that the highest bidder should be provided with a clean balance sheet, free of accumulated losses/unservicable liabilities of the DISCOMS. This, the federation said, would impose lakhs of crores of burden on State governments as they have to clear all balance recoveries, disputed recoveries, loans, etc. It was hard to digest such a scenario when States were reeling under the COVID-19 situation.

The federation said that privatisation and urban distribution franchise model have failed in Odisha, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Gaya, Bhagalpur, Agra, Greater Noida and many more cities. Despite this, the Union government was imposing such a failed model in the State, it regretted.

Besides impressing upon the State government the flip sides of the proposal, the federation would organise State-wide protests to spread awareness on the ill effects of privatisation. It has urged the government not to support privatisation of DISCOMS in the State in the larger interests of farmers, industries and the common man.

A similar protest was held in Udupi too.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/protest-staged-against-proposal-to-privatise-power-distribution/article32774328.ece
312,2020/10/05,Forum urges Railways to rescind train cancellation,"It was an affordable commuting mode for people during COVID-19 situation

The Pashchima Karavali Railway Yatri Sangha on Sunday urged the Railways to rescind the order cancelling Bengaluru-Mangaluru-Bengaluru four days a week Special Train (0615/0616) as the service was getting popular amid the COVID-19 situation.

“Sale of tickets for the service that was introduced just a few days ago cannot be the parameter for cancelling it,” said sangha president G. Hanumanth Kamath in a statement here. He said that the cancelled Bengaluru-Mangaluru Special as well as Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru Special (06585/06586), which is under the threat of being cancelled, were serving the travel needs of the entire coastal districts.

At a time when travelling had come to a standstill during COVID-19, services of these two trains were required for those in dire need of travel, Mr. Kamath pointed out. He said that the services were gaining popularity within a short span, from September 4, and the cancellation of the Mangaluru service was uncalled for.

Mr. Kamath noted that second class coaches were not required as there was no counter sales of tickets. So were air-conditioned coaches as people did not prefer to travel on them in view of COVID-19 threat perception. Counting their occupancy too while cancelling the service was fallacious, he argued.

With over 200 advance reservations every day, there was every chance of the services getting popular in the coming days. People stop online booking once availability position reaches RAC, Mr. Kamath said and added that general quota should be increased to facilitate more booking.

At a time when the economy was yet to recover from COVID-19 blues, train travel offered affordable mode of commuting. If that too are stopped, people would be put to greater hardship, he said. The special trains were necessary for the revival of the coastal economy. For that matter, almost all special trains across the country were running with fewer occupancy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/forum-urges-railways-to-rescind-train-cancellation/article32769529.ece
313,2020/10/05,Work on ₹174-crore Adyar-Harekala vented dam-cum-bridge begins,"The structure will provide drinking water to areas in Mangaluru Assembly constituency

Drinking water needs of areas on the southern bank of the Netravathi, from Konaje to Ullal under Mangaluru Assembly constituency, and a bridge connecting the southern bank with the National Highway 75 are likely to materialise in about two years with the Minor Irrigation Department commencing the construction work of a 520-m-long vented dam-cum-bridge between Adyar on NH 75 and Harekala.

An initiative of the then Minister and now Mangaluru MLA U.T. Khader, the Adyar-Harekala vented dam-cum-bridge would be built at a cost of about ₹ 174 crore, work order for which was issued to contractor G. Shankar, Udupi, in November last. Having got clearance for the project from the Karnataka State Coastal Zone Management Authority in March, the contractor recently commenced the work.

Besides providing drinking water to the fast developing regions of Mangaluru Assembly constituency, the bridge would offer a breather to thousands of residents of Konaje, Deralakatte, Mudupu, for a faster commute to NH 75 as well as to the city. Hitherto, they depended upon road transport via Thokkottu or boats at different Dhakkes. The education hub around Deralakatte entirely depended upon fast-depleting groundwater hitherto.

The structure being built in the CRZ of the Netravathi would submerge 19.2 hectares of land, including agricultural, a major portion being on the Harekala side, said Department’s Assistant Executive Engineer in Mangaluru K. Krishnakumar.

Land acquisition proceedings would soon begin, he told The Hindu.

Having commenced the work, the contractor was also in the process of fabricating girders for the bridge, getting gates for vents and other prerequisites, he said. Coffer bunds, for one third portion of the riverbed at a time, would be erected to facilitate the dam construction.

Though given two years time for completing the project, the contractor was confident of completing it ahead of the deadline, latest by the end of 2022, according to Mr. Krishnakumar.

While the department’s responsibility was to build the structure and provide irrigation facilities to about 260 hectares of land in Harekala, Pavoor and surrounding villages, the local authorities or the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department would arrange for drinking water supply, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/jkxoh2/article32767820.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MNADYARVENTEDDAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/work-on-174-crore-adyar-harekala-vented-dam-cum-bridge-begins/article32767826.ece
314,2020/10/05,GST Council fails to reach consensus on compensating States,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the panel will meet again on October 12.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Monday failed to iron out differences between Opposition-ruled States and the Centre over the plan to get States to borrow from the market to meet an estimated ₹2.35 lakh crore shortfall in compensation cess collections this year.

Following a “long-drawn”, fractious seven-hour meeting, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman asserted that she did not take “anybody for granted” as alleged by some State representatives in the Council during Monday’s discussions.

“We will not deny compensation dues to any State... borrowings have to be done and it has to be decided how much,” Ms. Sitharaman said, dismissing suggestions that States that don’t pick either of the two borrowing options offered by the Centre, could have to wait till next year to get any compensation.

The Council did agree to extend the levy of compensation cess under the GST regime, beyond the five-year period up to June 2022 as originally envisaged. The cess collections will be used to repay borrowings to be made this year for meeting the compensation shortfall, and will remain “for such period as may be required to meet the revenue gap”.

Immediate funds

While the Council will meet again on October 12 to resolve the impasse, the Centre decided to release ₹45,000 crore of GST dues to States by next week to help them meet immediate spending needs amid the pandemic.

This includes ₹20,000 crore of GST compensation cess collected so far in 2020-21, which Ms. Sitharaman said will be disbursed to States by late Monday night itself.

The balance ₹25,000 crore pertains to Integrated GST dues from 2017-18 that had to be reconciled between States that got more than they ought to have and those that got less than their dues at the time.

Also read: FMs of Congress-ruled States not happy with outcome of GST Council meet

“So the Council cleared that borrowings will have to be done and repaid through the extended cess collection period… 20-21 States had written to us stating they will take the first borrowing option we had given. One State has proposed a third option to the Prime Minister. From among those who have not chosen any option, the argument is that the Centre should borrow instead of the States,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

While compensation cess collections this year are expected to be just around ₹65,000 crore, recompense due to States is around ₹3 lakh crore. The Centre had argued that ₹97,000 crore shortfall arises due to GST implementation itself, while the remaining ₹1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of COVID-19.

Breakup revised

At Monday’s meeting, this calculation was revised with the Centre submitting that ₹1.10 lakh crore of the shortfall is due to GST implementation and the balance due to COVID-19. Under the first option offered to States, they can now borrow ₹1.1 lakh crore without impacting their borrowing limits or having to repay the loan or interest on it. Under the second option, States can borrow the entire ₹2.35 lakh crore shortfall.

Also read: GST Council meeting: Centre gives States two options for borrowing to meet revenue shortfall

The FM said interest repayments on ₹1.10 lakh crore borrowings would get the first charge on cess collected beyond June 2022. Of the rest, half would be used to repay the same loans’ principal and half will be used to repay the loans taken for cess shortfalls arising from the COVID-19 pandemic impact.

“Nobody anticipated COVID-19, not the lawmakers, not the GST Council. It is not as if the Centre is sitting on money and denying it to the States,” Ms. Sitharaman said, indicating that a few States called for a vote on the issue during the Council’s discussions.

There were some suggestions that States like Goa, Karnataka and Assam, which have agreed to the first borrowing option be allowed to go ahead, said the Minister. However, after Bihar Finance Minister Sushil Kumar Modi suggested that further discussions must be held with dissenting States, the Council decided to meet again on October 12.

High prices

For consumers, the extension of the compensation cess levy period would entail persistently high prices on such goods that attract the cess, said EY tax partner Abhishek Jain. “While an ad-hoc release of funds and an increased tenure should provide some comfort to States, the modus operandi on borrowings still remains a huge bone of contention without any consensus building up,” he added.

On the procedural front, the Council approved some changes so that the number of returns to be filed by smaller businesses are reduced from 24 to 8, starting January 1, 2021. Based on investigations of cases where taxpayers disappeared after claiming GST refunds, the Council has decided to restrict refunds to bank accounts validated by Aadhaar, while making Aadhaar authentication mandatory for all refund applications.

The Indian road freight transportation sector is expected to see revenue contraction of 18-20% in FY21 due to the adverse impact of lockdowns, ICRA Ratings has said.

ICRA has maintained its negative outlook for this sector due to expectations of continued pressures on the credit profile of road transportation companies. The rating agency said over the medium term, the sector would witness some consolidation trends, given the rising pressure on viability of small fleet operators.

“The aggregate revenues of ICRA’s sample of logistics companies contracted sharply by 35% during the quarter,” Shamsher Dewan, vice-president, ICRA Ratings, said. “The impact was more visible on players operating on an asset-heavy model, due to high fixed costs for owned assets, while asset-light players fared relatively better,” he added.

This decline was also corroborated by the generation of e-way bills, which contracted by 49% during the quarter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ii2bl5/article32776772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THBUROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/road-transport-revenue-may-shrink-18-20-in-fy21/article32776773.ece

Public sector lender Punjab National Bank (PNB), which has set its sights on the South and West for expansion, will open about 500 branches and add about 4,000 jobs during the current fiscal, said its MD and CEO Ch. S.S. Mallikarjuna Rao.

“We have completed the business and human integration of United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce with the PNB,” said Mr. Rao. “IT migration will happen by December and February 2021 respectively,” he added.

The bank, which currently operates 11,000 branches predominantly in the North and East, plans to expand in the South and West. Initially, the bank plans to open about 500 branches during FY21.

“The merger will lead to high incidence of rationalisation of branches,” Mr. Rao said. “If there are two branches within 500 metres, we will club them together and then use the licence to open a new branch in the South or in the West. That way, we hope to open 500 branches and will be writing to the RBI.”

By November 15, PNB will be adding almost 4,000 employees to its payroll with 990 of them absorbed in the officer cadre.

On loss-making branches, Mr. Rao said they would number about 350 and the bank was finding ways to reduce their count through innovative marketing of services or introduction of region-specific products.

317,2020/10/05,"Office space absorption rises 64% QoQ, says JLL","Delhi, Mumbai, Pune markets contract

The office market in India witnessed a net absorption of 5.4 million sq. ft. in the quarter ended September, an increase of 64% compared with the quarter ended June, according to estimates by JLL.

The rebound in growth was led by Bengaluru and Hyderabad, which together accounted for almost 80% of the net absorption. There was, however, a contraction in major markets of Delhi NCR, Mumbai and Pune. From a very low base, the Chennai market grew 110%.

“The heightened activity in Bengaluru indicates a gradual resurgence in taking up of spaces coupled with the translation of pent-up demand from the previous quarter of this year,” JLL said.

“While we continue to see the impact of the pandemic on various businesses, there is a significant surge in activity across most office markets under consideration. This is seen in gross leasing which more than doubled from the previous quarter at 13.8 million sq ft,” said Ramesh Nair, CEO and country head, India, JLL.

“At the same time, it is important to note that large and mid-sized occupiers across major markets continue to review real estate portfolios in a bid to optimise cost, laying higher emphasis on sustainability and employee well-being as well as adoption of flexible working practices,” he said.

While the share of IT/ITeS occupiers in gross leasing dipped to 43% in the September quarter from 61% in the previous quarter, e-commerce and manufacturing sectors gained significant shares during the September quarter forming 16% (negligible in June quarter) and 17% (5% in June quarter) respectively, owing to surging demand of e-commerce during COVID-19.

JLL said new completions increased by 59% quarter-on-quarter with 9.2 million sq ft of new stock coming to market.

“With lockdown restrictions being relaxed in the third quarter in most of the markets under review, office projects in the final stages of construction or pending receipt of occupancy certificates came onboard. This resulted in an increase in the supply of office space, even surpassing 8.6 million sq ft witnessed in Q1 2020,” said Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head of Research & REIS, India, JLL.

318,2020/10/05,Google defers Play Store billing move to March ’22,"Firm ‘mindful of local needs, concerns’

Google on Monday said it was extending the deadline for developers in India to integrate with the Play Store billing system by six months to March 2022, while adding that it would also be setting up “listening sessions” with leading Indian start-ups to understand their concerns.

The development comes after several Indian start-ups voiced their displeasure against Google over the company’s requirement that apps mandatorily use the Play Store’s billing system for in-app purchases of digital goods. Paytm, which competes with Google’s digital payments application GPay, on Sunday introduced its own ‘mini app’ store to support Indian developers.

“First and foremost, we want to reiterate that we are deeply committed to the success of the Indian ecosystem — we do not succeed unless our partners succeed,” Google said in a blogpost. “Being mindful of local needs and concerns” the firm said it had taken steps including planning workshops to clarify its policies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tdxian/article32776496.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THBUGOOGLE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/google-defers-play-store-billing-move-to-march-22/article32776497.ece

Vowing to make India a global hub for artificial intelligence (AI), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday stressed the need for transparency and accountability to protect against weaponisation of the technology by non-state actors.

“It remains our collective responsibility to ensure trust in how AI is used. Algorithm transparency is key to establishing this trust. Equally important is accountability. We must protect the world against weaponisation of AI by non-state actors,” the PM said at the inauguration of RAISE 2020, a virtual summit organised by the Centre.

Stakeholders from about 123 countries are expected to participate in the event.

‘Unique advantages’

Stating that creativity and emotions continued to be the greatest strengths of humans, Mr. Modi said these attributes were unique advantages that humans had over machines. “Even the smartest of AI cannot solve mankind’s problems without blending with our intellect and empathy,” he said.

Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani stressed the urgent need for a regulatory framework on data, which he said was the raw material for AI.

Observing that intelligent data was ‘digital capital’ and a vital national resource, he said, “In the coming decades… nations will increasingly compete on digital capital.

“We are confident that the government will introduce a sound data regulation framework to protect this national resource and ensure data privacy,” Mr. Ambani added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/uvjd4l/article32776484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THBUMODI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/shouldnt-let-ai-become-weapon-of-non-state-actors-says-modi/article32776485.ece

British telecom major Vodafone Group on Monday said it has received an approval from its lenders, who contributed in funding for Vodafone Idea, to proceed with the merger of Indus Towers with Bharti Infratel.

Vodafone Idea holds 11.15% stake in Indus Towers, which is estimated to be valued at around ₹4,000 crore.

Vodafone Group Plc. had announced on September 1, 2020 that it had agreed to proceed with the merger of Indus Towers Limited and Bharti Infratel Limited (Bharti Infratel, together the ‘combined company’).

“The agreement to proceed was conditional on consent for a security package for the benefit of the combined company from Vodafone’s existing lenders, for the 1.3 billion euros (about ₹11,100 crore) loan utilised to fund Vodafone’s contribution to the Vodafone Idea Ltd rights issue in 2019. This consent has now been received,” Vodafone said in a statement.

The parties will now approach the National Company Law Tribunal to make the merger scheme effective.

The announcement makes SpiceJet the second Indian airline to start operations on India-UK route after Vistara during the pandemic. Both airlines decided to launch London operations following the bilateral agreement between India and the UK which allows airlines of the two countries to operate a limited number of non-stop flights, eliminating competition from many other international carriers that operate flights via their hubs such as in the Middle East.

The airline will operate thrice-a-week to London, which will include twice-a-week flights from Delhi and once-a-week from Mumbai.

SpiceJet will use an Airbus A330-900 Neo aircraft for these flights. The 371-seater twin-aisle A330 has a configuration of 353 economy and 18 business class seats. The aircraft is wetleased by the airline. The low-cost airline will offer business and economy class seats on these flights.

322,2020/10/05,TCS m-cap surpasses ₹10 lakh crore mark,"It is the second Indian firm after Reliance Industries to do so.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Monday became the second Indian firm after Reliance Industries to attain a market valuation of more than ₹10 lakh crore helped by a rally in its share price.

In the morning trade, the stock jumped over 6% ahead of its board meeting later this week to consider a share buyback proposal.

The stock rose by 6.18% to reach its record high of ₹2,678.80 on the BSE. It zoomed 6.16% to ₹2,679 — its all-time high on the NSE.

Following the rally in its share price, the company’s market valuation jumped to ₹10,03,012.43 crore in afternoon trade on the BSE.

TCS last month became the second Indian firm to have a market valuation of over ₹9 lakh crore after Reliance Industries Limited.

It is the second most-valuable domestic firm in terms of market capitalisation.

Meanwhile, Reliance Industries Limited is the first Indian firm to have crossed the ₹10 lakh crore market valuation mark. Its market valuation is currently at ₹15,02,355.71 crore - the highest for any listed company in the country.

TCS in a regulatory filing on Sunday night said that “... the board of directors will consider a proposal for buyback of equity shares of the company, at its meeting to be held on October 7, 2020“. No other details of the buyback plan were disclosed.

The TCS board is also slated to consider its financial results for the September quarter and declaration of a second interim dividend to the equity shareholders at that meeting.

In 2018, the Mumbai-based company had undertaken a share buyback programme worth up to ₹16,000 crore.

The buyback, at ₹2,100 per equity share, had entailed up to 7.61 crore shares. In 2017 too, TCS had undertaken a similar share purchase programme.

TCS had announced the mega buyback offer as part of its long-term capital allocation policy of returning excess cash to shareholders.

“TCS has announced that the board of directors will consider a proposal for buyback of equity shares ... We believe that while this is a positive development for the company it is also a positive development for the sector given that it could be a precursor for other IT companies to follow suit.

323,2020/10/05,Adjuvant Alhydroxiquim-II to boost immune response of Covaxin,"Vaccine maker Bharat Biotech, ViroVax sign licensing agreement.

Coronavirus vaccine Covaxin will use adjuvant Alhydroxiquim-II to boost immune response and longer lasting immunity.

The technology is being used under a licensing agreement with Kansas-based ViroVax, said Bharat Biotech, which is currently conducting phase II human trials of Covaxin.

“Our partnership with ViroVax resonates with Bharat Biotech’s relentless efforts towards developing safe and effective vaccines coupled with long term immunity,” the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker’s CMD Krishna Ella said.

In a statement, announcing the licensing agreement, he said there is critical need for development and availability of adjuvants that elucidate mechanisms of action inducing greater antibody responses to vaccine antigens, thus resulting in long-term protection against pathogens. Adjuvants also enhance the sustainability of the global vaccine supply on account of their antigen-sparing effect.

Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine derived from a strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. The inactivated virus is formulated with ViroVax’s adjuvant to produce the vaccine candidate, the release said.

Mr. Ella said the widely used adjuvant Aluminium hydroxide in the development of SARS CoV-2 vaccines is known to induce a Th2 based response (which are important for eradication of extracellular parasites and bacterial infection). The Th2 based response has a theoretical risk of vaccine associated enhanced respiratory diseases (VAERD or ADE). “We have used Imidazoquinoline class of adjuvants (TLR7/8 agonists), which are known to induce Th1 based response which further reduces the risk of ADE (Anti-Body Dependent Enhancement).

“In our preclinical studies and animal challenge models (Syrian Hamster and Rhesus Macaques) we have shown that Covaxin induced Th1 based response due to the use of Algel-IMDG (chemosorbed imidazoquinoline onto the aluminum hydroxide gel) as an adjuvant,” he said.

Sunil David of ViroVax said the firm is delighted to partner with Bharat Biotech. “This has been possible because of support from the National Institutes of Health,” he said.

ViroVax also received supplemental funding for development of subunit vaccine constructs for the prevention of COVID-19 and for the discovery and development of therapeutics for treating COVID-19. ViroVax is evaluating a subunit vaccine candidate and has identified potential antiviral therapeutics. It is currently in the process of testing the efficacy of these compounds, the release said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mzc2lk/article32187647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24-BINDU-AIIMGVH7K7EGP3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/adjuvant-alhydroxiquim-ii-to-boost-immune-response-of-covaxin/article32771112.ece

12 million visits

“This app store has been running in beta with select users and witnessed over 12 million visits in September,” the company said, adding that listing and distribution of these mini apps within Paytm would be provided free of charge.

Further, the app developers will be able to give a choice of Paytm Wallet, Paytm Payments Bank, UPI, net-banking and cards to their users for carrying out payments.

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

Punctuation matters. But cryptic crossword setters are liars, brigands, deceivers, prevaricators, skullduggers, schemers, and just plain liars. So, when they add a punctuation mark in their clue, just ignore it. Better yet, go ahead and just subtract it from the clue. It will help you out in uncovering the answer without being unneccessarily misled.

To reiterate: in real life, in real prose, in real written communication, punctuation matters more than your life. So, please use punctuation properly. It is good for the heart, mind, soul, and is very possibly a cure for COVID-19. Choose life, health and well-being. Punctuate.

Everyman #3850 | 3 Down CLUE: Perhaps the PM’s hiding fondness, in the end, for EU members (9) Clue types : Cryptic, letter-pick Definition : EU members Answer : ESTONIANS Clue explained: Let’s suppose we need a 9-letter word here that means ‘EU members’. That would mean that ‘Perhaps the PM’s hiding fondness, in the end, for’ is the wordplay we need to use to find the answer. Also, point to note: this is an Everyman clue. Meaning that it appeared in The Guardian, a British newspaper. So, it would definitely would help that we kept in mind that the clue has been composed by an Englishman. This gives a certain context to the clue and helps us form an approach to solving it. So, ‘Perhaps the PM’ is a common way for a setter to possibly refer to either a specific Prime Minister or a specific quality of many Prime Ministers. And since this is an Everyman clue, we could conjecture that it is talking about the quality of many British PMs having studied at a unviersity called Eton, which would make the common British PM an ETONIAN. Then the rest of the wordplay gives us ‘hiding fondness, in the end’. This just means that ETONIAN may be containing (‘hiding’) an S (‘fondness, in the end’ means that we get an S, as it is the last letter of ‘fondness’). So, if the word ETONIAN gets an S, it becomes ESTONIAN. But here’s a trick that the setter pulled on you. When you read ‘Perhaps the PM’s’, in all fairness you figured that a single Etonian was being referred to. Hang on, though. In cryptic crosswords, punctuation doesn’t matter. So, that apostrophe between ‘PM’ and ‘s’ was apparently of no consequence, meaning that we have PMs in the plural. So, ESTONIAN would have to be ESTONIANS!

330,2020/10/05,The future of GST hangs in the balance,"The Centre is best positioned to raise additional resources to bridge the GST compensation gap

Today is the crucial meeting of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council. It may not be an exaggeration to claim that today’s meeting could mark a milestone in the history of India’s fiscal federalism and shape the future of Centre-State relations.

In 2017, the Centre made a promise to the States that a certain minimum amount of GST revenues will be guaranteed to every State for every year until 2022. GST was born in the cradle of this promise and hailed as a harbinger of ‘cooperative federalism’. Now, there is not enough money in the GST kitty for the Centre to honour this obligation. The Centre has therefore proposed that the States should borrow money to bridge this gap and that it will act as a guarantor to facilitate this borrowing. Many States have accepted this proposal while many others have rejected it and implored the Centre to borrow. There is a bitter stand-off between the Centre and these protesting States.

The Hindu Explains | What is the GST compensation due to States?

Widening trust deficit

This is further complicated by the recent revelation of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and explained by Professor Govinda Rao in The Hindu, that in the last few years, the Centre deliberately mis-allocated nearly ₹3 lakh crore collected through various cesses, to reduce the States’ share of tax revenues. The Centre’s dishonesty has eroded its credibility with the States and widened the trust deficit. Amidst this background, the GST compensation issue could be put to vote in the GST Council meeting today.

The GST Council has 31 States and Union Territories represented. The Council was set up in 2017 as a new financial institution with the enormous economic responsibility of directing policy for half of all tax revenues of the country. Sadly, this vital institution, like many others, has dwindled rapidly into yet another avenue for political power play.

Twenty members of the GST Council that have agreed to the Centre’s proposal are governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or a BJP alliance. The 11 States that have opposed the Centre’s plan are all governed by the Opposition. The 11 opposing States account for a greater share of overall GST revenues than the 20 supporting States. But it does not matter since every State, large or small, has equal weight in the GST Council. Twelve votes can veto a proposal in the GST council.

Comment | On the GST issue, the Centre holds the baton

The Centre has reiterated its commitment to fulfil the GST compensation obligation to the States. So, only the modus operandi of raising funds to fulfil this obligation is to be decided. This is primarily an economic issue and should be settled based on what makes the most economic sense for each State and for the nation overall.

Each State’s economic realities are distinct. Just four States — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — account for nearly as much GST tax revenues as the remaining 27 States and Union Territories combined. But Gujarat and Karnataka support the Centre’s proposal while Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have opposed it. GST compensation constitutes a significant share of the revenues of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, yet Himachal Pradesh supports the Centre’s plan while Punjab is against it. Rajasthan and Haryana have similar sized fiscal deficits. Rajasthan is understandably apprehensive, but Haryana seems ready to indulge in more borrowing.

Naïve and clichéd as it may sound, a State’s decision to borrow or not should be based on its fiscal situation, not its political affiliation. State fiscal policies are complex matters and cannot be decided through a ‘high command whip’. The GST compensation imbroglio has exposed the shallow rhetoric of ‘cooperative federalism’ and exacerbated the politicisation of the GST Council.

Alternative revenue sources

Economic logic suggests that the Centre, and not the States, is best positioned to raise additional resources to bridge the GST compensation gap. State governments don’t have the powers to levy direct taxes or indirect taxes to earn additional revenues. A State’s finances are not in the hands of the State government any more.

But the Centre has multiple alternative revenue streams. It is true that COVID-19 has ravaged the economy and strained government finances. But even in this severe economic slowdown, the Centre can find some new and creative options for tax revenues that are not available to the States.

Purely for illustrative purposes, one such revenue opportunity can be through increased taxation of capital market transactions. Between April and June, when economic activity in the nation had come to a complete standstill, India’s stock markets experienced its highest activity levels in its history, with a 75% increase in transactions vis-a-vis last year. The stock market rose 30% in this period and a minority few profited handsomely. In all likelihood, this buoyant stock market activity did not create one extra job in the real economy. The Centre can levy a higher tax on such speculative stock market trading to earn additional revenues during these difficult times, which will also not hurt the economy like an increase in GST rates or cess will do.

A five-fold increase in the securities transaction tax from its current minuscule levels of 0.025% can potentially generate an additional ₹50,000 crore of revenue for the Centre, which can be very handy in these times. Contrary to belief and fearmongering by stock market participants, 15 years of data show there is no evidence that, in India, raising securities transaction taxes adversely impacts stock market activity or the overall economy.

The larger point is that such options for new revenue generation are not available for the States. In these dire economic conditions, the Centre has many more avenues to raise additional resources than the States. A combination of additional revenues and borrowing by the Centre can help resolve the GST compensation issue amicably.

There is fear that the international ratings agencies may downgrade India’s rating to “junk” status if the Centre’s borrowings rise exorbitantly. It is understandable that no finance minister or bureaucrat wants the badge of a downgrade. But it is inane to believe that just offloading the borrowing to States can fool the ratings agencies.

The economic argument is crystal clear that it is more prudent for the Centre to use its much greater ammunition to raise additional tax revenues and/or to borrow to keep its GST promise. It makes no economic sense for the States, regardless of which party is in power, to increase their borrowing at the behest of the Centre. States will be forced to borrow anyway for their own expenditure. The credibility of the GST Council and the larger idea of cooperative federalism can still be salvaged if, in today’s meeting, the Centre can shed its cussedness and end this impasse by committing to raise resources to plug the GST compensation gap.

331,2020/10/05,A commission misguided,"The national child rights body seems to be deriving its priorities from the political agenda of the day

The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) is the apex body for upholding, monitoring and facilitating child rights in the country. However, as persons previously associated with this esteemed body, we note with great concern some of the recent actions of the Commission that suggest a grave departure from its primary duty to ensure the well-being of all children, especially children in need of care and protection.

Major concerns

Amongst its significant powers and duties, the NCPCR has been specifically charged with the monitoring of Child Care Institutions (CCIs) and was instructed to carry out a social audit of the same by the Supreme Court. The social audit was initiated in 2015 and upon its completion, the NCPCR, in its wisdom, directed District Magistrates in eight States to ensure that all children within CCIs be de-institutionalised, repatriated and rehabilitated within a specified period. Civil society organisations have raised several obvious concerns about this, especially because most of these children are in CCIs due to abusive conditions in the family, and a mandated repatriation without an adequate case-by-case assessment plan within a short period of time would likely place the children again at grave risk of abuse, exploitation and neglect. They also point to the sheer inadequacy of current systems to organise adoption and foster care.

Also read | National Commission for Protection of Child Rights needs counselling on own rules: Activists

Juxtaposed with this diktat is the disturbing report of raids being undertaken on the eve of Gandhi Jayanti by the NCPCR in select NGO-run CCIs, in order to establish whether foreign funds have been misused in any manner. Not only is monitoring of the FCRA regulations outside of the mandate of the NCPCR, but the raids also seem to target individuals who have been outspoken in the criticism of the Central government on issues such as the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Such raids seem to have communal overtones as an enquiry led by none less than the Chairperson reportedly delved into whether the previously homeless children in the CCIs belonged to a particular community (Rohingya), and what religious practices they engaged with, even as the institutions are known to maintain a secular character.

A lot to be done

The pandemic has exacerbated existing issues of child malnutrition, child labour, child abuse, child marriage and mental illness. We would have expected the NCPCR to show concern for the gross violation of children’s rights during the lockdown and in its aftermath. The NCPCR could have used its authority and power to issue recommendations to relieve these grave conditions by reiterating the need for strengthening all child-related institutions (government and non-government) through adequate funds, and appreciating the relief measures that many civil society organisations, including the ones being raided and instructed to close down, were engaged in.

As citizens concerned with the rights and welfare of children, we have also been appalled at the daily reports of Dalit children and young women being raped and murdered, with gross irregularities by the very institutions that are charged with their protection. We would have expected the NCPCR to exhibit its priorities better by taking suo motu cognisance of the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl in Bhadohi in Uttar Pradesh, to make a test case of the lack of systems to fight crimes against children instead of moving to undermine and dismantle whatever little does exist for their protection. Undoubtedly, CCIs need monitoring and reforms; the Commission should be in the vanguard to ensure the support that would necessarily be required to implement these reforms. Yet, it seems to be deriving its priorities from the political agenda of the day rather than upholding a steadfast and fair commitment to the welfare of children.

332,2020/10/05,English is an Indian language,"The National Education Policy’s refusal to consider English as an Indian language is a backhanded effort to impose Hindi

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 proposes a three-language formula under which schools must teach at least two languages that are “native to India”. Conspicuous by its absence in this category is English, threatening access to English instruction in public schools. This has played into popular notions that English is no more than a “colonial imposition”, not “native” to Indians. It is time to retire and reject these notions and recognise that English is very much an Indian language. Rather than trying to justify contentious historical criteria for “native”, we must focus on what English is to India today: an aspirational, cosmopolitan, widely spoken language we have made our own.

An inclusive language

The history of language and learning in India has been fraught with problems. Education in traditional knowledge systems has been highly discriminatory, especially along caste lines. English education emerged as an emancipator and equaliser, allowing people across social groups to break away from exclusionary knowledge systems. Dialect and vocabulary in regional languages are still indicators of caste and community, and enable further exclusion. English presents an opportunity to master a language that no one can exclusively claim as their own in India. This has helped sustain its appeal long after the British left. Middle-class Indians, many of whom have never studied English, want their children to attend English-medium schools, not just because of a promise of jobs, but of a respectability that English represents. This has made English a pathway to unique economic and sociocultural mobility that has given us a global advantage.

English is the global lingua franca; it is the world’s preferred language of commerce, science, diplomacy and culture. Competence in English has enabled India to establish itself in these areas and its diaspora to thrive across the world, especially in the field of technology. The association between English and stable, well-paying careers is obvious and apparent.

Today, Indians give shape to new thought through English. Science has relied on it to pool the best minds of the country and create a strong base of research, innovation and teaching in the field. We have drafted a Constitution and given shape to essential rights and ideals in English. Legal processes in India rely heavily on what has become the international language of the law. It is the language of our courts and some of our greatest legal minds such as H.M. Seervai, Nanabhoy Palkhivala and Krishna Iyer. Indian authors have also produced enduring English literature. R.K. Narayan, Khushwant Singh, Vikram Seth, Shashi Tharoor (who has made big words cool), Aravind Adiga, Chetan Bhagat, Shobhaa De, Arundhati Roy and many others have given us a rich Indian English which is as much our own as any other “native” language.

Part of daily life

Our debates on language are often detached from practical reality; the truth is that in India, the usage of English is already much more pervasive than people acknowledge. Languages borrow from English with abandon. Whatever part of the country we are from, we talk on mobile phones and say “hello”, “thank you” and “happy birthday”. Whatever language one speaks, texting uses the Roman alphabet (in convenient Indian English keyboards), and emailing in any other script is unheard of. We have English words for many parts of daily life, and every Indian language relies on them. Would a car/cycle mechanic, electrician or postal worker be able to conduct tradecraft without some English? Do we have a well-developed and widely known vocabulary of medical jargon in any other Indian language? Every city has its own impressive English slang. How long can people hold a simple conversation on their own without using any English words? The convenience that even a passable knowledge of English lends to general communication is unparalleled.

English is most popular in parts of India where the opposition to the homogenising ‘Hindi, Hindu, Hindutva’ agenda is strongest. The NEP’s refusal to consider English as an Indian language is simply a backhanded effort to impose Hindi nationwide, restricting the autonomy of schools and States. In Tamil Nadu, a two-language policy has worked successfully for decades. Children have continued learning Tamil while also benefiting from the practical advantages of English. The NEP threatens this, and will not be acceptable to the people of Tamil Nadu.

The fact is that today, English has become essential to success in India. For an aspirational middle class, knowledge of English is a great emancipator — a path to a better future. In making rich contributions to the country and world through English, we have made it our own. The time has come to recognise it.

333,2020/10/05,Until vaccine: The Hindu editorial on Unlock 5,"Unlock moves should continue to protect the vulnerable, as the economy shifts gears

India’s fifth round of unlock regulations for October, allowing a further expansion of public activity mainly in education, entertainment and business conferences, comes at a time when COVID-19 transmission is steady in many cities. Nationally, though, the new infections being added everyday, at about 60,000, represent a decline in recent days, as per Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center data. The stringent March-April lockdown, and the subsequent measures to unlock the economy to prevent an equally debilitating crisis to livelihoods, have made India an uncommon case study. The decision to allow States to consider reopening schools and coaching centres after October 15, for students who wish to optionally attend, will prove a difficult one, considering new research evidence based on data from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh pointing to high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of virus cases in the same age group. Slowing community spread is bound to become more complicated, since governments blame careless attitudes for continued transmission — notably in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. While essential movement for economic reasons, including use of public transport, is unavoidable, indifference towards safe public behaviour is extracting a heavy social cost. Even in the face of a deadly pandemic, governments are taking a benign view of recalcitrant people who do not wear masks, even on buses and trains, spit in public, and crowd commercial locations. During the monsoon and winter months, and the festive season, polite, persuasive enforcement would be essential to reduce infection rates.

Among the relaxation measures in the October unlock phase is permission for cinemas and multiplexes to open at 50% capacity, but the risk surrounding enclosed spaces and transmission from asymptomatic individuals is real. Viewed against the enhanced risk of environments where masks are removed for eating and drinking, such as cinemas and restaurants, these entertainment options may not have wide appeal in the pre-vaccine phase. While the economy shifts gears in the activity phase, the Centre should be focusing on improving the understanding of the health impacts of COVID-19. Disappointingly, while it has emphasised massive recovery rates from the infection, it has failed to standardise testing and reporting methods among States, and publish fine-grained data on types of tests carried out in each State, anonymised patient histories, post-recovery status for complications and mortality. Repeated emphasis on a large number of recoveries, which were expected anyway, but without the necessary caveats, may be encouraging millions to lower their guard. Every effort to relieve the citizen’s fatigue over COVID-19 should be made, but the goal is to preserve health until a medical breakthrough is made.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/until-vaccine-the-hindu-editorial-on-unlock-5/article32767148.ece
334,2020/10/05,Mixed signals: On September GST data,"The latest GST data give cause for hope of a sustainable momentum in growth

In these pandemic-hit times, when most economic news has been grim, the latest GST data give cause for some hope, albeit cautious, especially to policy makers overseeing beleaguered public finances. Gross revenue collections from GST scaled a six-month high of ₹95,480 crore in September, the first time in the current fiscal year when the tax receipts exceeded the year-earlier period’s figure. Clearly, with lockdown restrictions having been significantly eased, economic activity appears to have regained some momentum as people strive to reclaim a semblance of normality and businesses rush to restock inventory ahead of the peak consumption season in festival-marked October and November. Other high-frequency indicators, including automobile wholesales and the survey-based Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing, both for September, reflected this push to build up stocks. The IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI reading was at its highest in more than eight years as accelerated increases in new orders and production buoyed the sector’s outlook. GST revenue from the import of goods was also marginally higher than in the year-earlier period, signalling that inward shipments of commodities used as inputs in manufacturing had inched up. Merchandise trade data from the Commerce Ministry show Indian purchases of metal ores and pharma products in September posted increases of almost 43% and 28%, respectively, appearing to correlate with the trend in GST.

However, the 3.88% year-on-year growth in gross GST revenue must be seen in the backdrop of the fact that GST receipts had slid to a six-month low in September 2019 — a 2.7% contraction — as overall economic momentum slowed considerably. The key concern now would be to gauge the durability of the trend in GST collections, especially considering that over the first six months of the current fiscal, the cumulative revenue receipts are 25% lower year-on-year. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s annual Budget for 2020-21, announced in February before the pandemic and lockdowns pushed the economy into a record contraction, had projected a 12.8% growth in GST receipts, a goal that now seems surely impossible to realise. With the GST Council expected to meet today and attempts to resolve the contentious issue of GST compensation shortfall, Finance Ministry officials have their task cut out in trying to assess if their earlier projections of a ₹3-lakh crore shortfall in GST compensation would need to be recalibrated in light of the uptick in receipts. A reasonably accurate prognostication for the tax collection trend for the second half may well hold the key to untangling this logjam over the ways to fund the shortfall and the Centre-State trust deficit it has created.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mixed-signals-the-hindu-editorial-on-september-2020-gst-data/article32767149.ece

336,2020/10/05,252 project extension applications pending with RERA-K,"Homebuyers suffer as RERA and builders blame each other

Applications of as many as 252 projects seeking extension of deadline are pending with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority - Karnataka (RERA-K), many of them for over a year now. As builders allege red tape at RERA-K, authorities blame the delay on builders not providing adequate documentation to make their case and lack of response to their queries.

While builders and RERA-K blame each other, it is home buyers who are paying a steep price.

“Given the market situation, most projects that have applied for extension are in need of funds they plan to raise from the market or avail new loans from banks. However, with the expiry of the deadline as registered with RERA-K and no extension given, builders are not able to raise funds bringing work on most of these projects to a grinding halt for nearly a year now,” said R. Ramesh who represents a property consultant firm.

This time is mostly lost in the project cycle. “As work on the project comes to a halt while an application is pending with the Authority, it is the hapless homebuyer who pays a steep price. The delivery of their homes is delayed, which forces them to continue paying both rent and home loans for this additional period for no fault of theirs,” rued M.S. Shankar, Forum for People’s Collective Efforts, which represents homebuyers.

Builders allege red tape and lack of rationale in clearing applications, including absence of a queue system, at RERA-K.

“Not just extension applications, even trivial applications like change of address, bank account details have been pending at RERA for many months. While some recently made applications are cleared, many made several months ago are pending,” said a developer.

RERA-K authorities blame builders for the delay. “Most of the applications have been pending for a long time as builders have given incomplete information and have not bothered to respond to our repeated queries. Two weeks ago, we began hearing of each application online over video conferencing due to COVID-19,” said K.S. Latha Kumari, Secretary, RERA-K.

Forum for People’s Collective Efforts recently wrote to the Housing Department of the State government seeking their intervention.

“As per RERA-K website, deadlines of 618 projects have expired and they have not even applied for an extension. What action has RERA-K taken against these projects? Also, RERA has to grant extension only if the Authority is convinced that there are compelling reasons for the developer to not be able to complete the project within the deadline, on a case-by-case basis. Deadlines for 182 projects have been extended by a year. But there is no transparency on the grounds for grant of extension,” Mr. Shankar, who wrote the letter, said.

The letter seeks a review meeting of RERA-K by the State government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pfhanx/article32776194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGRERAP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/252-project-extension-applications-pending-with-rera-k/article32776196.ece

338,2020/10/05,Karnataka to come out with cyber security policy,"Bengaluru recorded the maximum number of cyber crime cases among all the metros in India

The State government has announced that it will come out with a cyber security policy soon.

Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who is also the minister for IT&BT, made the announcement on Monday after inaugurating the celebration of October as Cyber Security month. Bengaluru had recorded the maximum number of cyber crime cases – 10,668 in 2019 – among all the metros in India.

The Minister said that digital transactions are expanding and cyber security has become a subject of paramount importance. He said that the cyber security policy would address the needs of citizens, industry, students as well as the State government.

The Minister said that the country stands in the third position in the world among the Top 20 countries in internet-related crimes.

“The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has issued an advisory on coronavirus pandemic-based cyber attacks. The majority of the attacks are done via phishing emails, malicious advertisements on websites, and third-party apps and programs. Attacks on computers, routers, and unprotected home networks are also on the rise,” the Minister said.

One of the two engineers who were injured in the fire at the combined cycle power plant at Yelahanka, succumbed to burn injuries early on Monday.

The deceased has been identified as Balaji Murugan from General Electric, who had been admitted in the burns ward of Victoria hospital.

In the early morning fire on Friday, as many as 15 persons, including employees of KPCL and BHEL, were injured. The fire was reportedly caused due to leakage of CNG when the Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. (KPCL) was preparing to commission the long-pending plant.

V. Ponnuraj, Managing Director of KPCL, said that the report into the incident was yet to be submitted. “GE and BHEL are yet to submit the root cause analysis report. Once their report is submitted, we will decide on the next course of action,” he told The Hindu.

Meanwhile, the Yelahanka Puttenahalli Lake and Bird Conservation Trust has been trying to file a complaint against KPCL for damage to the environment, particularly the flora and fauna of the lake. A member of the Trust claimed that the incident had been recorded as a fire by the police. A police team, which visited the site to take stock of the situation, maintained that there was no blast.

However, the Trust member said that residents of Heritage Estate, which abuts the plant, woke up to a blast. “The loud sound also disturbed the birds in the lake. However, no details are forthcoming from KPCL,” the member alleged.

The Trust is engaged in a case with the KPCL over the plant. The Trust claims that the plant is located within a 500-metre radius of the protected lake. The case is being heard by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

“There are enough and more scientific evidence that operation of such plants is dangerous to the surroundings. Gas leakage, like the one that occurred on Friday, could prove fatal,” the member added.

The Trust member also alleged that the Yelahanka New Town police refused to file ab FIR based on their complaint. “We asked them to investigate the damage caused to the lake environment,” the member said and added that legal experts had advised residents of Heritage Estate to file a case. “We will continue to pursue the matter. We will meet senior police officials on Tuesday in this regard,” the member added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fire-in-power-plant-engineer-succumbs/article32775908.ece

343,2020/10/05,Bengaluru bookstores turn to delivery apps to up sales,"A majority of the walk-in customers continue to be regular ones

About five months after they were allowed to reopen, bookstore owners in the city are looking at ways to get people back. While some store owners remain optimistic and say that business is picking up, others say that it has been “up and down”.

Mayi Gowda, owner of Blossom Book House at Church Street, which reopened on May 4, has observed an uptick in customers over the last fortnight. “The number of walk-ins is at 60% — the majority being regular customers — of what it was before the pandemic. One reason is that post-Unlock 4, nearly everything is open and so more people are out. The other is that people have been sitting at home for such a long time so now they want to step out,” he said.

While children’s books always sell, he noted that new releases are also in demand now as most people have finished reading the books they had at home. Customers have also been getting books delivered for months now via delivery apps. Blossom, for instance, has tied up with Dunzo to deliver books to customers, and provides about 800 titles that are sold at full price.

As for whether the number of deliveries has come down with walk-ins going up, Mr Mayi Gowda says, “Some people still have that fear of being out so deliveries are also going on. We get about 12 to 15 orders in a day.” He adds that they also get 10 to 12 orders a day from across India such as Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.

Lightroom Book Store, Cooke Town, which caters to children and young adults, gets orders within the city — via delivery apps or the store sends couriers — as well as from outside Bengaluru. “We got on Instagram only in February this year and that has resulted in orders from a lot of new people and orders from places such as Nagaland and Assam. We send packages out every day,” said owner Aashti Mudnani.

Stating that it’s difficult to pinpoint the number of orders the store gets every day, she said, “This whole week has been good and we sold 10 books a day. But last week, business was slow with only three sales a day.”

As for the walk-ins, Ms. Mudnani says, “From the time we reopened on April 27, we have had two or three walk-ins a day. I think it’s a lot to do with the fact that we are located in a residential area. Initially, people would come without children, but now I see that more and parents bring their children.”

Nagasri Book House, which is located in Jayanagar BDA Complex, reopened on June 3. Guru Prasad, who, along with Venkatesh K.V., owns the store said that business had been very good in June when they reopened. “But afterwards it came down. Now, business is 50% to 60% of what it was pre-pandemic and it’s only given by regular customers.”

Krishna Gowda, owner of Bookworm on Church Street, which opened on April 25, said that the walk-ins are at a maximum of 40% compared to pre-pandemic. “But we were sending books via delivery apps even during the lockdown and that has continued. Regular customers with elderly people or children at home tell us their requests and we send their orders.”

He added, “While it’s mostly been regulars, one positive point is that a lot of new customers have been calling us, particularly youngsters. It looks like they developed a reading habit during the lockdown. We have also seen a fantastic response on Twitter.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/z86i61/article32767740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGBOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bookstores-turn-to-delivery-apps-to-up-sales/article32767741.ece
344,2020/10/05,Amendments to KMC Act will push BBMP elections again,"Polls cannot be held for the civic body in its present form of 198 wards

Amendments to The Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, which was notified by the State government on Saturday, will push elections to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) by a few more months.

The amendment has not only said that BBMP should have not less than 225 and not more than 250 wards, but has also provided for a delimitation commission. This means, as per the KMC Act, 1976, elections cannot be held for BBMP in its present form of 198 wards. The delimitation and reservation exercise that the State government carried out recently has gone for a toss and the exercise has to be redone to increase the number of wards to at least 225. This is expected to push the BBMP elections by at least four to five months, sources in the government said.

A writ petition filed by the Karnataka State Election Commission and a few Congress councillors in Karnataka High Court seeking timely polls is expected to come up for hearing again on October 12. “Since this is the will of the legislature now made into a law, it is to be seen what the High Court that has been keenly following up on the delimitation and reservation process to ensure timely elections will do now,” a senior official in the Urban Development Department said.

S. Raghu, chairman of the legislature committee on the BBMP Bill, 2020, said the committee had recommended the size of a ward be limited to an average population of 35,000, which will give the city 241 wards in the present area under BBMP limits. “As per the new amendments, the delimitation exercise has to be redone to increase the number of wards. The Chief Minister, who also holds charge of Bengaluru Development, will shortly chair a meeting to decide on the number of wards and other modalities,” he said.

Adopting the Chennai model, a delimitation commission is likely to be chaired by the BBMP Commissioner to carry out the delimitation and reservation of wards exercise, sources in UDD said.

However, many have criticised this as another “time buying mechanism” and say that the entire exercise is likely to be rendered null and void again in a few months as the government plans to bring in a dedicated law for the city’s governance.

“The BBMP Bill, 2020, is a long-pending governance reform for the city. We want to transition the city into a new governance setup and hold elections under the new law and not under the existing KMC Act, 1976. If elections are held under the KMC Act today, the operationalisation of the BBMP Bill, 2020 will likely be postponed for five years which the city cannot afford,” a senior BJP functionary said.

A Congress member of the legislature committee on BBMP Bill, 2020, said the Bill in its present form was not radically different from the KMC Act, 1976 and made only cosmetic changes. “There seems to be no will to fix the structural governance deficit in the city and the entire exercise seems to be aimed at postponing polls, which is unconstitutional,” he said.

No consensus

Meanwhile, Mr. Raghu said that there was no consensus over the inclusion of new areas to BBMP. “A call on addition of newer areas to BBMP and the criteria for that will be decided at a later date,” he said, indicating newer areas may be added to the city corporation limits when the BBMP Bill, 2020, is made into a law. This will force the government to go for another round of delimitation, officials said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/amendments-to-kmc-act-will-push-bbmp-elections-again/article32767710.ece

Kumaraswamy on Sunday urged the government to withdraw the decision immediately.

Mr. Kumaraswamy said: “The decision to allot 32 acres, including 15 acres each to yoga university and Gulbarga University and 2 acres to the CBSE for its South India office, will turn the Bangalore University campus into a concrete jungle. The State government should allot land to these institutions elsewhere and protect the park.”

“Environment experts have put in their efforts for two decades to develop the biodiversity park. The government's unilateral decision that was taken without any consultation is dangerous and will destroy the park,” the former Chief Minister said in a series of tweets on Sunday. He further said: “Veteran environmentalist Yellappa Reddy has announced his decision to return the honorary degree in protest against the decision. Environmentalists have also supported him.”

“The government’s decision to hand over the biodiversity park area, which was developed by the NSS students and public, to these three institutions is condemnable as the flora is going to be destroyed.” The former Chief Minister pointed out that former Vice-Chancellor K. Siddappa had started the work on this park with a vision to make it an open laboratory. “Today, it is supporting hundreds of research work of students from botany, biology, environment sciences and social sciences.

346,2020/10/05,Chennai Corporation turns dump yard into mini forest,"The vacant plot of land in Kotturpuram had been used to dump construction debris and garbage, but has now become a green zone with over 2,000 saplings planted

The Greater Chennai Corporation has transformed a dumpyard near the Kotturpuram railway station, which had been an eyesore to the public, into a green zone.

Civic officials of the Adyar zone have made a mini forest out of the vacant plot of land located along Canal Bank Road on the eastern side of the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) railway station in Kotturpuram.

A resident of Kotturpuram said the vacant plot, leading to the underground car park, had slowly become a place for dumping construction debris. Over the years, residents along Canal Bank Road had also started dumping garbage there.

Moreover, customers from the nearby liquor shops used the land as a public toilet. Motorists and residents found the dumpsite an eyesore, and petitioned the civic officials to take steps to stop the dumping of waste there.

Alby John Varghese, Regional Deputy Commissioner (South), Chennai Corporation, said a number of complaints were received from the residents of Kotturpuram about the misuse of the vacant plot.

“After a visit to the site, the civic body tried to prevent the dumping of waste by putting a warning noticeboard, but still the dumping of debris continued. Then we conceived of the idea to turn the vacant plot into a green zone using the Miyawaki method. The vacant plot was ring fenced and the construction debris was removed and replaced by more than four feet of fresh earth,” he said.

The greening project, which was inaugurated by Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash in February this year, has more than 2,000 tree saplings spread over 30,000 feet.

Though the mini forest is closed for public viewing at present, the civic body plans to open it up for the public once the saplings are well grown and after a footpath has been paved.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/3fdn9/article32773811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05OCTTH--Forestjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-corporation-turns-dump-yard-into-mini-forest/article32773812.ece
347,2020/10/05,Dairy farmers in Tamil Nadu call for insurance cover for all milch animals,"Only 10% of the estimated 14 lakh cattle are currently insured

Milk producers in the State have urged the government to ensure universal insurance coverage for all milch animals. Currently, only 10% of the cattle have coverage, causing farmers to bear the losses if an animal without insurance dies.

""A cow can cost between ₹30,000 and ₹40,000, and if it dies it would be a loss of income and investment. Insurance would help in such a case,” said K.A. Sengottuvelu, president, Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Welfare Association.

A former Aavin official said that some ten years ago, former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had given funds for insuring milch animals. “However, at present, only about 1.5 lakh cattle of the estimated 14 lakh have been provided coverage through the Tamil Nadu Lifestock Development Agency. Under this, the cost is being borne equally by the Centre, the State government and the milk union,” he said.

M.G. Rajendran of the association said it would take only about ₹50 crore per year to provide coverage for all the milch animals supplying milk to Aavin. “The amount can be divided between the federation, which is Aavin, the unions, the cooperative society and the farmers. Many unions are earning profits since they only buy and sell milk. They don't convert milk into butter and skimmed milk powder and wait for the prices,” he said.

The milk farmers also want Aavin to provide medicines for the cattle, as is being done by some private dairies. “Earlier, Aavin, too, used to provide medicines for the cattle, but now some unions have kept essential medicines for the sake of showing stock,” said a milk producer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yifl9x/article32768403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04COWS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dairy-farmers-call-for-insurance-cover-for-all-milch-animals/article32768404.ece

The YouTube channel of the School Education Department’s Kalvi TV, which hosts video lessons for students of Classes 1 to 12, has crossed 1.6 lakh subscribers.

Apart from being telecast on Kalvi TV and a few private television channels, the video lessons are also being uploaded on the Kalvi TV YouTube channel for students to access at their convenience. “Over 90% of the videos we have are in Tamil, and we are planning to release lessons in English soon,” said P.A. Naresh, joint director, School Education Department, and special officer, Kalvi TV. The telecast of video lessons for Class 11 students began in late September.Similar lessons for all other classes are being aired on TV and hosted on the YouTube channel since July.

The telecast of lessons began in a bid to reach more students across the State, especially those from government schools who do not have access to online classes, and ensure they continue to learn.

While the School Education Department had planned to create 8,000 video lessons meant to be telecast and uploaded online, over 5,000 lessons have already been telecast, and the others are in the works, Mr. Naresh said.

A team of teachers from the District Institutes for Education Training (DIETs) and officials from the Department are working on creating the content and recording and checking the video lessons. For students of Class 10 and above who have disabilities, the TV channel has begun telecasting lessons in sign language, and these are being uploaded on the YouTube channel as well.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xukz2a/article32768379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THKALVITV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/subscriber-count-of-kalvi-tv-youtube-channel-crosses-16-lakh/article32768380.ece
349,2020/10/05,Guduvanchery stretch of GST road to be widened soon,"NHAI permits shifting of utilities on Guduvanchery-Mahindra City stretch

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has granted sanction for shifting of utlities on a 13 km-long stretch of the NH45 Chennai-Tiruchy Highway, from Guduvanchery to Mahindra City.

This is the first step towards the widening of the four-lane road into an eight-lane facility.

The State’s NH wing will carry out the work on the Grand Southern Trunk (GST) Road, said sources in the NHAI.

“These include transplantation of trees and planting of new saplings and will cost ₹21.37 crore, which has been sanctioned. The total cost of the widening project will be ₹230 crore and the project will be carried out in three phases,” said an official source.

The widening will help reduce accidents on the road, which many pedestrians use throughout the day.

“Both sides have thick urbanisation, which has also caused local traffic to take the highway. Widening will pave the way for some kind of segregation of vehicles on the busy road,” said another official.

T.R. Srivatsan, who runs a coffee outlet near Maduranthakam, said though the distance is only a few kilometers, it takes a long time to cross it.

350,2020/10/05,"Use number plates that comply with Motor Vehicle Act, say Chennai traffic police","This will enable cameras to properly capture the characters

In a bid to ensure contactless enforcement in the wake of the pandemic, the Chennai traffic police will be installing automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras across the city in the coming days.

To ensure that the cameras are able to capture the number plate properly, they have asked motorists to have the registration plates as per the Motor Vehicle Act regulations.

According to the police, officers find it hard to identify the vehicle on CCTV footage using the number plate as they are in different sizes and are not fixed as per the norms.

A common issue

“This difficulty is faced in cracking law and order offences too,” a senior police officer said.

He said the traffic police were trying to implement full contactless enforcement during the pandemic.

“The ANPR cameras will be installed across the city as part of the Smart City, Safe City and other projects. This will enable us to track vehicles violating traffic norms using the number plate. So it will be better if they are in the size prescribed by the Motor Vehicle Act,” the officer noted.

On Sunday, the traffic police warned motorists to stick to the mandated size while fixing number plates.

“Action will be taken against motorists using number plates not adhering to regulations. We have already issued challans to those in violation but enforcement will be stricter going forward,” the officer explained.

Vehicles registered after April 1, 2019, should have high security registration plates. “Action will be taken against those who do not have them,” the officer said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/n0y9ev/article32768323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04OCTTHNUMBER-PLATES-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/use-number-plates-that-comply-with-motor-vehicle-act-say-chennai-traffic-police/article32768324.ece

Nearly 29 lakh residents have completed home quarantine till now, which accounts for nearly 35% of the city’s population, officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation said.

At present, 1.79 lakh people are still in home quarantine, including those who had tested positive, their contacts, those in fever clinics and those who travelled to the city.

So far, 5.14 lakh people coming from other States or districts have finished quarantine, while nearly 71,000 are still undergoing it.

Nearly 3,300 volunteers were pressed into service and they went across the city’s 15 zones to ensure that the people under home quarantine complied with the norms, an official said.

Volunteer assistance

“From delivering food at their doorsteps to ensuring that they did not step out, these volunteers made a world of difference. In a few cases, volunteers have even gone and fetched water from pumps for those under home quarantine,” he added.

As relaxations are put in place around the city, there are some emerging challenges to ensure people do not let their guard down.

352,2020/10/05,Union Public Service Commission prelims held with COVID-19 precautions,"The examination was conducted in over 2,500 sub-centres set up across 72 cities

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination was held on Sunday. Students said it was moderately difficult, and those who were retaking the test said it was as tough as it had been the previous year.

Postponed twice

The exam, which was to be held on May 31, had been postponed to September 30 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was then moved to October 4, despite aspirants seeking further postponement. Over 10.58 lakh aspirants across the country had applied for the test.

This year, the test was offered in more centres than in the previous years. Candidates had sought more centres as they could not travel due to the lockdown. Over 2,500 sub-centres were set up across 72 centres.

Candidates said safety measures, such as hand sanitisers and use of masks, were mandatory.

Their temperature was also measured, and invigilators wore gloves. The test had two components — one on general knowledge and another on aptitude, reasoning and comprehension.

The second paper is a qualifying test, while the scores of the first paper are used for qualifying for the UPSC Mains exam.

A coach said aspirants from rural backgrounds found the second paper difficult.

Changing centres

Kartik Kansal, who has muscular dystrophy, took the test from a centre in the city and said the paper was on the tougher side.

However, he said he faced no difficulty in seeking a change of centre. In July, when the Commission decided to increase the number of centres, many candidates flagged the issue of non-receipt of the One-Time Password (OTP) or delayed response to their request for changing the centre.

Mr. Kansal is currently serving at the Indian Space Research Organisation and is posted in Sriharikota as a scientist. He had qualified last year with a rank of 816.

Originally from Uttarakhand, Mr. Kansal had earlier chosen Dehradun as the centre, but changed it to Chennai as he is working in Sriharikota.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/p93fxh/article32768292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04UPSC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/union-public-service-commission-prelims-held-with-covid-19-precautions/article32768268.ece
353,2020/10/05,Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services trains volunteers to assist in rescue operations during northeast monsoon,"The preliminary session was attended by 50 people from different walks of life

It is not just the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) personnel who will rush to help during emergencies during the northeast monsoon this season.

A 21-year-old woman, a 67-year-old man, a short film cameraman, a hospital employee, and 46 other people from different walks of life are among those who have volunteered to assist the TNFRS in rescue operations.

The TNFRS recently started preliminary training for the 50 volunteers. They were taught about the functioning of the Fire and Rescue Services, basic knots and lines, rescue tactics using various equipment, the operation of different TNFRS equipment and snake rescue.

Lending a hand

The only woman volunteer was Vedhapriya Ganesan, 21. A pet stylist, she was formerly a project assistant with the Central Zoo Authority of India. “I always wanted to be in the uniformed services and was inspired by C. Sylendra Babu, Director, TNFRS. Hence, I volunteer with the Fire Services whenever they are in need,” she said.

Another volunteer is B. Narayanan, a 67-year-old security guard at a private hospital at Villivakkam.

“I always wanted to help people during emergencies. But youngsters always leave me behind, thinking I am old. Hence this time, I attended the training. It was a really good experience,” Mr. Narayanan said.

Priya Ravichandran, Joint Director, Northern Region, TNFRS, said: “It turned out to be a refresher course for the few who were already associated with us. But for the others, it was a new experience.” Ms. Ravichandran said during the northeast monsoon, the volunteers could assist the fire service department in a few rescue calls.

“There will be tree falls, animal rescues, wall collapses among other calls that flood our control room. These volunteers can assist us in handling such emergencies,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mn0blb/article32768231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04MONSOON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tamil-nadu-fire-and-rescue-services-trains-volunteers-to-assist-in-rescue-operations-during-northeast-monsoon/article32768232.ece
354,2020/10/05,Stations in Chennai Metro Rail’s phase I extension will be renamed,"CMRL aiming to open Washermenpet-Wimco Nagar stretch by next year

Chennai Metro Rail stations in the phase I extension project, coming up in north Chennai, may have new names before they are opened to the public early next year.

The project will be 9 km-long and will connect Washermenpet with Wimco Nagar.

Four stations

The names of the stations were decided when the detailed project report was prepared. Washermenpet, Thiyagaraya College, Korukkupet, Tondiarpet, Toll Gate, Thangal, Gowri Ashram, Tiruvottiyur and Wimco Nagar were the stations on the route. Four of these are likely to be renamed.

Korukkupet station will be renamed Tondiarpet, while the existing Tondiarpet station will become New Washermenpet. Thangal Metro station will be renamed Kaladipet, and Gowri Ashram will become Tiruvottiyur Theradi.

Sources said the High Power Committee in the government had approved the renaming.

“One of the reasons for changing [the names] may be to use names familiar to the residents of the area,” a source said.

All stations are in different stages of construction and Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) is planning to finish the project by the end of this year or early next year. “Track work is nearly complete and a few key systems for operations will be installed now,” an official said.

Renaming of stations has been done a few times in the past, like when the OTA station in phase I came to be called Nanganallur station. Arignar Anna Alandur Metro, Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Metro and Puratchi Thalaivi Dr. J.

355,2020/10/05,Transforming business and the insolvency system,"Further streamlining of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code can instil more confidence in foreign and local investors

The Prime Minister mentioned the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC 2016) as one of the key legislative reforms that would help aid India’s path to self-reliance on a high growth trajectory. The IBC, along with the Goods and Services Tax regime, among other key reforms, were helping in significantly improving the ease of doing business in India and enabling it to emerge as a ‘Make for World’ platform. He also credited these reforms for a surge in Foreign Direct Investment into India in 2019-2020, to the tune of nearly $74.5 billion, or a significant increase of 20 per cent from the previous year.

A key reform step

The IBC has been a far-ranging and structurally significant reform that has transformed insolvency resolution in India. Replacing a rather inefficient bankruptcy law regime, the IBC has focused on time-bound resolution, rather than liquidation, as an empowering tool to support companies falling within its ambit. It has successfully instilled confidence in the corporate resolution methodology, and perhaps, more importantly, on creating a possibility for the creditors recouping some of their investments in firms being liquidated or going in for resolution. Its core implication has been to allow credit to flow more freely to and within India while promoting investor and investee confidence. Despite the suspension of the IBC for a limited duration due to the COVID 19 pandemic, in the short, medium and long term, it will prove to have been a timely reform. It will greatly streamline insolvency processes in a sustainable, efficient, and value retaining manner.

India, unfortunately, suffers from a serious backlog in court cases, to the tune of nearly four crore matters pending final judgment. The novel coronavirus pandemic is likely to exacerbate this. The enforceability of contracts has been a challenge. On an average, it takes as many as 1,445 days for a contract to be enforced, and that too at a cost of nearly 31% of the claim value. This is simply unacceptable.

Criminal penalties

Along with further streamlining and reinforcing the IBC, the Government of India is also working toward decriminalisation of minor offences. NITI Aayog is playing an active role in this exercise, which will significantly reduce the risk of imprisonment for actions or omissions that are not necessarily fraudulent or an outcome of mala fide intent. Criminal penalties including imprisonment for minor offences act as major deterrents for investors. The government’s intent is to help differentiate between good faith mistakes and intentional bad faith actions, so as to penalise the former, and criminalise the latter.

Moves that will help

Other legislative measures that will further improve the investment climate, include the rolling out of the commercial courts, commercial divisions and the Commercial Appellate Divisions Act, 2015, to allow district court-level commercial courts, and the removing of over 1,500 obsolete and archaic laws. Together with the IBC, these highlight a major and multi-dimensional effort by the government to provide comfort, relief and reliability to the potential investors.

The IBC is both flexible and dynamic, which makes it impactful, given how forward thinking the concept of an omnibus legislation of its nature actually is. The IBC goes beyond other similar pieces of legislation across the world, and through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), it has established an unprecedented organisation that both regulates and develops insolvency policy, and assesses market realities.

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), in its year end summary press release, provided the context of India’ s rapid rise in the Ease of Doing Business rankings, and IBC’s important role of the IBC in it. According to the Resolving Insolvency Index, India’s ranking improved to 52 in 2019 from 108 in 2018, a leap of 56 places. Further, the recovery rate improved nearly threefold from 26.5% in 2018 to 71.6% in 2019. And, the overall time taken in recovery also improved nearly three times, coming down from 4.3 years in 2018 to 1.6 years in 2019.

Two key drivers for the IBC are relatively short time-bound processes, and the focus on prioritising resolution rather than liquidation. The report of the Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee speaks of the critical need for speed in the working of the bankruptcy code. It is clear that the inability to make significant decisions without full clarity of ownership and control delays resolution. And, the longer the delay, the more likely that the entity in question would move towards liquidation rather than resolution. The delays result in low value liquidation due to a high economic rate of depreciation. Higher value stems from the firm being acquired as a going concern.

Going forward, there could perhaps be a look at institutionalising the introduction of a pre-packed insolvency resolution process, the need for which is highlighted by the necessary suspension of the IBC proceedings. This will also help resolve matters expeditiously, outside of the formal court system, and allow resolution even during the COVID-19 altered reality.

Helping MSMEs

The MCA along with IBBI are working diligently on putting in place a Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) and non-MSME framework to help expedite this process.

Comment | The fault in our drafts

At the same time, given the need for social distancing and the suspension or limitation of physical hearings, a concerted effort should be made to enhance the role of digitally conducting all processes and hearings to achieve greater efficiency in the new normal. Bringing in technology would help ease of access to justice and greatly help ease of doing business from a process and efficiency standpoint as well. The IBC has provided a major stimulus to ease of doing business, enhanced investor confidence, and helped encourage entrepreneurship while also providing support to MSMEs. Its further streamlining and strengthening will surely instil greater confidence in both foreign and domestic investors as they look at India as an attractive investment destination.

In two separate depositions, he underlined to the committee that “the issue [on the Sino-India-Bhutan border] is more of attempting to alter the status quo on the ground... It is this aspect that transforms a transgression into a larger diplomatic and political issue shifting the matter from the domain of the Armed Forces to that of Foreign Policy”.

Armed forces as the cover

Three years later, it is now clear that China has unilaterally altered the status quo on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh over the past five months — and at multiple points. As in Mr. Jaishankar’s benchmark, it has become transformed into a larger diplomatic and political issue, but the armed forces are still fronting the issue, whether in bilateral talks or in public communication. Once the matter had moved away from the domain of the armed forces, attention should have shifted from the military to the government as the public face of the crisis. However, that has not been the case so far as the government has been keen to shield itself from public criticism by demanding unquestioning support for the armed forces. Tightly embracing the military and pushing it to the forefront of domestic public imagination is an insurance policy for political leadership when it is facing severe criticism.

Civil-military relations theorists have long warned against the participation of armed forces in domestic political roles in democracies, especially in times of a crisis. Micromanagement of the type we have witnessed during the Ladakh crisis, where the precise agenda and specific arguments of the Indian military delegation during the talks have been decided at the highest levels of government in Delhi, has drawn the armed forces into the political debate.

If stark political divisions over this issue exacerbate, it could draw the military even deeper into the political slugfest, a situation best avoided. Peter D. Feaver’s research shows that linking the prestige of the military to debatable political decisions, as the government has attempted, carries with it the potential for reduced overall public confidence in the military and increased doubts about the military’s competence, truthfulness, and other dimensions of trustworthiness.

Key men, mixed signals

The government is headed by a Prime Minister who is a master at public communication and not short of words on any issue. He regularly speaks directly to the people, either through his own radio show, by updates on social media platforms, through his public speeches broadcast on television channels, or his addresses to the nation. He has been, however, conspicuous either by his silence on the border crisis or by his laboured efforts to avoid mentioning China by name.

The one time he chose to speak in detail on the issue was during the all-party meeting, on June 19, called by the government to discuss the violence on the India-China border, where he said: “Na koi wahan hamari seema mein ghus aaya hai aur nahi koi ghusa hua hai, na hi hamari koi post kisi dusre ke kabze mein hain (No one has intruded and nor is anyone intruding, nor has any post been captured by someone)”. His rather convoluted formulation, that needed an elaborate official clarification, handed the Chinese officials an argument they have gleefully used to embarrass the Indian interlocutors in all bilateral negotiations thereafter.

Editorial | Lost in clarifications: On Modi's LAC statement

From his cabinet, the External Affairs Minister has not spoken at any great length about the border crisis, although he has held multiple events related to the launch of his new book, The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World. Only the Defence Minister, who was the first to confirm the border crisis in a news television interview, delivered a carefully prepared statement in Parliament on September 15. The statement was factually correct but did not leave anyone better informed at the end of it. He took no questions from Members of Parliament, denying the Indian citizen an opportunity to have authoritative information and form her own view about the government’s decision-making. Compare this to the reality in the British Parliament, where some of the toughest questions on the most sensitive issues are thrown at the Prime Minister, who has to answer them as a measure of his accountability to the people.

The presiding officer of the Rajya Sabha asked the Defence Minister to brief the leaders of Opposition separately but there has been no such briefing even two weeks later, and Parliament has been prorogued. The country still does not know whether the Cabinet Committee on Security, which is the highest authority in the country on matters of national security, has met and discussed the grave border crisis in the past five months. In contrast, the previous National Democratic Alliance government had conducted official daily briefings during the 1999 Kargil War and senior Ministers were available to answer the media’s questions.

The government’s argument for not taking any questions in Parliament was the surmise that these were sensitive operational issues which cannot be discussed in public. It holds little credence going by the operational details shared by top armed forces officials in unofficial media briefings. It means that there are enough relevant aspects that can be made public without compromising military operations or national security.

Editorial | Terms of disengagement

A more viable argument in support of the government’s stance is that every government needs a free hand during negotiations and making information public ties its hand for any give and take during parleys. For e.g., the government may have hypothetically wanted to ignore the territory China has ingressed in Ladakh after May, if it could have a firm commitment from Beijing on delineating the international boundary. That would not have been possible had the Prime Minister told the Indian public on June 19 that China now denies India access to more than 1,000 square kilometres of territory in Ladakh — he would be under pressure to publicly ask the military to throw the Chinese out. By stating that no Chinese soldier was in Indian territory, he retained the flexibility to clinch such a hypothetical deal.

On public opinion

However, democratic governments can use public opinion to strengthen their hand during negotiations and to avoid making concessions to the other party. Pakistani leader Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto did it during the 1972 Simla negotiations after Pakistan’s loss in the 1971 Bangladesh war.

Nearer home, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee nudged the Opposition parties to hold public protests against plans to send Indian troops to Iraq in 2003, an idea his deputy, L.K. Advani had agreed to in Washington DC The excuse of adverse public opinion allowed Vajpayee to pull back from Advani’s assurance to the Americans.

Wanted, official information

The lack of official information about the crisis has been damaging in other ways too. Not only are people uninformed; they are also misinformed by the gung-ho jingoistic, hyper-nationalist commentators and journalists who have hyped up the Indian military and diplomatic capabilities. Their desire to believe the most exaggerated version of events showing India in the greatest light, has put more pressure on this muscular government which cannot afford to be seen as weak. The gravest warning of keeping the people in the dark comes from neighbouring Pakistan — on the day its armed forces surrendered to India in Dhaka on December 1971, the Pakistani media was running reports of a glorious military win. A more honest dissemination of information prevents such situations from developing, which can have damaging consequences for the country going forward.

India is facing a grave crisis on its borders which shows no sign of ending. As an issue in the middle of a raging novel coronavirus pandemic and a plummeting economy, it needs a ‘whole-of-government’ approach directly under the visible leadership of the Prime Minister. But the government seems shy of taking ownership of the crisis, instead placing the armed forces as the public face of the challenge. Having the uniform as a shield to avoid democratic accountability may be politically profitable for the government but it carries the risk of aggravating the crisis and hurting India.

The Prime Minister, true to his form, never misses an opportunity to ridicule the Congress for failures (Page 1, October 4). However, this is like flogging a dead horse — the Indian National Congress is facing an existential crisis and apportioning blame on it does not strike a chord with people. Despite the NDA being in the saddle for long, the country has not witnessed any conspicuous change on the political, social or economic fronts. Even ties with neighbouring countries are at all-time low. The government gleefully cites ‘acts of god’ for its failures. The common man earnestly waits for the government to start delivering on its promises; sloganeering and punch lines are not helping.

Deepak Singhal,

It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister has yet again used a public function to target the previous government as if he was addressing a political rally. I have nothing against the present government taking credit for speeding up projects. The leader ought to understand that while taking up initial work in such difficult terrain, there are hurdles to clear.

The most challenging is excavation during heavy snowfall. There were other difficulties including disposal of huge quantities of excavated rock and soil and heavy ingress of water. There were also extreme natural events. Keeping the upcoming elections in mind, that the Prime Minister used the opportunity to inaugurate the project in person, instead of a virtual unveiling, shows narrow thinking.

Crime and the politics

The recent incidents in Hathras and Balrampur are a shocking example of continuing apathy and deprivation that is heaped on certain deprived sections of society. What is appalling is the state apparatus actively working to thwart justice to the victim and her family. What is even more shocking in 21st century India is the apparent apathy by law makers as well as the enforcers. Delays in registering complaints, trying to browbeat so-called lower castes into withdrawing complaints, ‘doctored’ reports, etc. ensure that these victims do not get justice (and in the Hathras case, not even decent final rites).

Prabhakar S.,

The sad reality is whatever the political party and their tussles, the fate of the hapless and the downtrodden continues to be the same — sad. There are enough laws and constitutional organs such as the executive, legislature and judiciary need to work in tandem to eliminate the grave ills haunting our society.

359,2020/10/05,Bombay High Court reserves order in plea filed by Kangana Ranaut against BMC demolition,"Actor had sought compensation of ₹2 crore from the civic body

The Bombay High Court on Monday reserved judgment in a plea filed by actor Kangana Ranaut after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished portions of her bungalow in Bandra.

A Division Bench of justices S.J. Kathawalla and R.I. Chagla on September 9 stayed the process of the demolition. Soon thereafter, affidavits and affidavits in reply were filed by the actor and the civic body. The 33-year-old actor also amended her petition and sought compensation of ₹2 crore from the BMC.

On September 22, the court impleaded Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson and Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament Sanjay Raut as a respondent in the petition. This was done after Ms. Ranaut’s advocate Birendra Saraf submitted a DVD containing Mr. Raut’s statements against the actor, which she alleged led to the demolition.

Mr. Saraf had argued, “Ms. Ranaut is at loggerheads with the Maharashtra government over certain issues. She has displeased a party in power with her open views. She had to face life threats and had to seek special protection from the Centre. Sanjay Raut has made derogatory statements against Kangana in TV channels. He said that Kangana needs to be taught a lesson. On the same day when Raut made remarks, an officer from the BMC visited and entered the property without prior notice. The timing of the visit assumes relevance.”

On September 28, the Bench had observed, “There is something absolutely fishy here in the manner in which portions of the bungalow were demolished.”

The BMC has maintained that Ms. Ranaut carried out substantial work of alterations and additions at the building.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cvuc1m/article32780644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BMCDEMOLITIONKANGANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bombay-high-court-reserves-order-in-plea-filed-by-kangana-ranaut-against-bmc-demolition/article32770766.ece

361,2020/10/05,In harmony with Nature,"National Wildlife Week is a good time to see how to protect and conserve our wildlife. Here are four communities who have come together to do just that.

Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary, Arunachal Pradesh

With a distinctive fluty call, a diminutive bird with a striking olive green plumage flew out of the tree in the forests fringing Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary, West Kameng district, Arunachhal Pradesh. Astronomer and bird watcher Ramana Athreya watched with quickening breath, as this bird, which is found only in these forests, had not been sighted since 1995.

The indigenous Bugun tribe has ownership of these forests and, in their honour, the bird is named Bugun liocichla. This 17 sqkm community reserve is home to several threatened species including the red panda, golden cat and marbled cat. Youngsters of the tribe, along with the Arunachal Pradesh Forest Department, jointly patrol the forest and help with rescue and rehabilitation apart from promoting eco-tourism initiatives.

In Nagaland’s Longleng district, 350 households of the Phom tribe from three villages — Yaongyimchen, Alayong and Sanglu — have transformed around 10 km of forest into a wildlife refuge. They are the catalysts for preserving and protecting the biodiversity without government assistance. The Yaongyimchen Community Biodiversity Conservation Area (YCBCA) is home to 85 species of birds, 15 species of frogs, leopards, barking deer, serow and otter. Today, it is the largest roosting area for Amur falcons.

Dugave, Karnataka

For the last three years, villagers in this village in the Konkan region of Ratnagiri district have taken it upon themselves to protect the pangolin. They worship it and believe it is blessed and protected by their goddess Waghjai.

To them, the pangolin is the farmer’s friend and plays an important role in preserving the ecosystem. This year, they celebrated Khawalotsav on World Pangolin Day, February 15. The pangolin is under threat because of poaching, trafficking and international trade.

Chennai, Tamil Nadu

In this coastal city, efforts to save the Olive Ridley turtle began in the early 1970s. In 1988, the Student’s Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN) was formed. The Tamil name Panguni aamai refers to the fact that the creature comes ashore to nest in the month of Panguni (mid-March to mid-April), when members of the SSTCN patrol the beaches at night, collect the turtle eggs, relocate them to a safer place and finally release the hatchlings into the sea.

Interestingly, the hatchlings are released a few metres away from the waterline so that they can geo-map the location into their memories. This helps them come back to the same beach to lay eggs. Commercial fishing, large-scale trawling and dredging, changing beachscape and artificial lighting are some of the causes for the decline in turtle numbers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/7gn541/article32772258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Conservation,https://www.thehindu.com/children/how-four-communities-in-india-have-come-together-to-protect-and-conserve-wildlife/article32772259.ece

The UT had decided to permit students in both the regions studying in Class 9 to 12 in all schools to visit their institutes on a voluntary basis for taking guidance from their teachers, to get doubts clarified, for counselling and other related works in areas outside the containment zones.

“On Monday we have started cleaning the premises, supplying gloves, sanitisers, thermal scanners and other essentials needed to maintain personal hygiene and social distancing norms. In the next two days, meetings will be held in the schools to sensitise teachers and members of parent teachers’ association. From Thursday, academic activity will resume,” Director of School Education P. T Rudra Goud told The Hindu.

The classes will begin with 10th and 12th standards and thereafter for standards 9 and 11 on October 12. To begin with for these classes, the schools will function on alternate days. The schools will function only during forenoon and function for six days instead of five days, he added.

The schedule for class-wise opening will be Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for Class 9, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays for Class 10, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for Class 11 and Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays for Class 12, the Director informed.

Schools authorities have started marking of boxes on the ground floor to ensure physical distancing norms, he said adding attendance of students should be purely on parental consent.

The school authorities are free to hold the interaction with students in open places ensuring personal distancing norms. Wearing masks is mandatory for students and teachers.

363,2020/10/05,CM inaugurates multilevel parking lot in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation,"He cites project as a sign of effective participatory democracy

Implementation of projects based on people’s demand in the capital is a sign that participatory democracy is functioning effectively at the local body-level, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. He was inaugurating the newly constructed multilevel car parking lot on the city Corporation premises through video conferencing here on Monday. He also launched work on another parking lot at Palayam and an Integrated Command Control Centre on the Corporation premises.

“One of the major issues in the capital is the lack of enough space for parking. The public has been facing a lot of difficulties due to this. The Corporation should be lauded for taking a step to address this. It shows that the local body is intervening in issues based on the demands of the local people. To make the functioning of local bodies truly participatory, projects should implemented in consultation with the public,” said Mr. Vijayan.

102 cars at a time

Across seven floors, the multilevel parking lot in the Corporation can accommodate 102 cars at a time. It will be opened to the public once the parking fee rates are fixed and passed in the council. Executed under the Central government’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme, the parking lot was completed at ₹5.64 crore. Out of this, 50% of the cost was borne by the city Corporation, 30% by the Central government and 20% by the State government.

The proposed parking lot at Palayam is coming up on land owned by the Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority (TRIDA), at a cost of ₹32.99 crore under the Corporation’s Smart City project. The project is being executed by a Pune-based company, with an expected completion period of 15 months.

New entry

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran inaugurated the new entry to the city Corporation, constructed for ease of entry for the public to the multilevel parking lot on the premises.

364,2020/10/05,We have taken first step to restart football activities: AIFF president Praful Patel,"AIFF General Secretary Kushal Das said the governing body is committed to developing the game in the country.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has taken the first steps towards restarting the game, its president Praful Patel said on Monday unveiling the governing body’s new motto — ‘Indian Football. Forward Together’

Like all other sporting activities, football also came to a standstill due to the COVID-19 lockdown.

The cash-rich Indian Super League (ISL) backed by the AIFF, in all likelihood, will be the first sporting competition in the country after a phased opening of the lockdown. The event starts October 20 and will be held in Goa.

“The entire country is going through a period of lull especially when it comes to sport. AIFF has already taken the first step to bring back sporting activities in the country and it is only becoming possible because all the stakeholders are working seamlessly and tirelessly in this direction,” Patel was quoted as saying in an AIFF media release.

“With the new motto in place, our objective is to streamline these efforts in our communication with all the stakeholders. Even the smallest unit in the chain plays an important role,” the former Union Minister said.

He, however, did not elaborate on the measures taken to restart the game.

AIFF General Secretary Kushal Das said the governing body is committed to developing the game in the country.

“We have been doing an immaculate amount of work starting from developing grassroots to the national teams.

“Slowly but gradually, by working together, I am sure we will be able to achieve great things while establishing a pipeline of young talent for the Indian football team,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/kyrcc/article32772200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIFF,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/we-have-taken-first-step-to-restart-football-activities-aiff-president-praful-patel/article32772201.ece
365,2020/10/05,Sevilla suffocates Barcelona in 1-1 draw at Camp Nou,"Ronald Koeman’s team dropped its first points in the Spanish league.

Sevilla’s superb defense held Barcelona to a 1-1 draw at Camp Nou on Sunday as Ronald Koeman’s team dropped its first points in the Spanish league.

Striker Luuk de Jong put Sevilla ahead in the eighth minute when he blasted home a loose ball that fell to him in the box after a corner. It was the first league goal conceded by Barcelona this season.

Barcelona hit back two minutes later. Lionel Messi drifted back into midfield and lobbed forward a pass to meet Jordi Alba’s run from the left side. JesŴs Navas tried to intercept, only to knock it into the path of Coutinho who fired it home.

Sevilla’s defense clogged up the middle of the field the rest of the way. Holding midfielder Fernando and centerback Jules Kounde deactivated the playmaking of Messi and Coutinho, while also stopping incursions by Ansu Fati from the left flank.

""We had a game plan that we wanted to carry out,” coach Julen Lopetegui said. “They leveled quickly, but we got right back in the match and had chances to do more damage that we couldn’t convert.”

Lopetegui’s well-coached side has kept up its excellent team play from last season when it won the Europa League and finished the league in fourth place.

""Today was a difficult, complicated match. We knew it would be,” Coutinho said. “They had a lot of players in the middle of the defense and it made it difficult. We will have to find ways to fix that But this has just started.”

Barcelona’s midfield pair of Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets were pressured into passing errors, and Ronald AraŴjo had to stop a solo attack by Lucas Ocampos midway through the first half after a bad pass by Busquets was picked off.

Both coaches saw their attacks stall in the second half and substituted two forwards each with half an hour left. Koeman changed Fati and Antoine Griezmann for newcomers Francisco Trincŗo and Pedro “Pedri” Gonzŕlez, while Lopetegui sent on Munir El Haddadi and Youssef En-Nesyri for Ocampos and JesŴs “Suso” Fernŕndez.

En-Nesyri made a quick impact, breaking down the left and putting in a short cross that AraŴjo cleared onto the crossbar in what was almost an own-goal in the 64th.

AraŴjo started for Barcelona in place of the suspended Clement Lenglet. The rarely used 21-year-old Uruguayan played well in the second half of last round’s 3-0 win at Celta Vigo after Lenglet was sent off with two bookings before halftime.

Both teams have two wins and a draw this season.

Barcelona had won all its matches — including three preseason games — since Koeman took over following its humiliating 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the final game of last season.

“We lost more balls than we usually do ... but one week, three matches and seven points, we have to be happy,” Koeman said about his team’s start.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/fzlea9/article32769593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPAINSOCCERLALIGATHNAKx,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/sevilla-suffocates-barcelona-in-1-1-draw-at-camp-nou/article32769594.ece
366,2020/10/05,Premier League | Watkins hat-trick as Villa humble champions Liverpool 7-2,"Villa rained in 18 shots on the Liverpool goal and could have added more before the final whistle as they climbed to second in the standings after a third successive win. Liverpool are fifth.

A first-half hat-trick from Ollie Watkins helped Aston Villa to a stunning 7-2 victory over Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday to end the champions' 100% start to the season in extraordinary fashion.

Liverpool began badly at Villa Park as a poor pass from Adrian -- deputising for Alisson in goal for the visitors after the Brazilian picked up a shoulder injury -- gifted Watkins his the opener in the fourth minute.

A full-strength Liverpool defence was carved open again moments later, with former Everton midfielder Ross Barkley -- making his debut after joining Villa on loan -- gifted another chance, but he dragged his effort wide.

If there was an element of good fortune about Watkins's first goal in a Villa shirt, his second was all his own fine work, as he cut inside before firing into the top corner to stun the champions and make it 2-0 in the 22nd minute.

Mohamed Salah's fine left-foot finish seemed to get Liverpool back in the game in the 33rd minute, but John McGinn's deflected strike two minutes later restored Villa's two-goal advantage.

Watkins completed a perfect hat-trick inside 39 minutes with his head, becoming the first player to score a Premier League treble against Liverpool in over a decade, and Barkley made it five 10 minutes into the second half.

Salah did give Liverpool hope on the hour mark, but a late double from Jack Grealish completed the scoring, making it the first time Liverpool conceded seven goals in a match in any competition since 1963, a 7-2 loss at Tottenham Hotspur.

367,2020/10/05,Serie A | Juventus v Napoli abandoned after positive COVID-19 tests,"An official from the Naples ASL confirmed in a television interview that the Napoli players had been ordered to stay at home.

One of the top Serie A fixtures of the season was abandoned amid bizarre scenes on Sunday when Napoli failed to turn up to face Juventus, saying the local health authority had told their players to stay at home following positive COVID-19 cases.

With the Serie A league refusing to call the game off, Juventus arrived at the Allianz stadium in Turin in their team bus one hour before the scheduled kickoff time and announced their lineup while match officials were also present.

The floodlights were turned on, the match day music was played and photographs showed Juventus players on the pitch in training kits - with Napoli still in Naples.

After a regulation 45-minute wait, the match was officially called off with Serie A describing it as “not played” on its website. Under Serie A rules, Juventus are likely to be handed a 3-0 win.

A Napoli spokesman confirmed to Reuters hours before kickoff that the team had been placed into isolation by the health authority (ASL) after two players tested positive in the last four days. He said they would challenge any decision to forfeit the game.

An official from the Naples ASL confirmed in a television interview that the Napoli players had been ordered to stay at home.

“We've never expressly said they can't play but it's clear that is a consequence,” he said.

Earlier, Serie A insisted the game go ahead, saying the ASL had failed to take into account the health protocol agreed between the country's health and sports ministry and the football authorities.

This states that, if players test positive, the rest of the squad can still train and play again providing they are tested again and return negative results. The statement added that several matches had been played this season after teams had one or more players test positive.

“The protocol lays down certain rules that cannot be deviated from, which allow league matches to be played even in the event of a positive result, deploying players who have tested negative,” it said.

Juventus made a point of saying they were preparing for the match, posting a Tweet which said simply “Matchday”, accompanied by a photograph of forward Cristiano Ronaldo, hours before kickoff.

“Juventus abide by the rules and there is a clear protocol,” club president Andrea Agnelli told reporters.

Last Sunday, Napoli hosted Genoa, where 17 players have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last week. Genoa's match at home to Torino on Saturday was postponed.

Serie A has ruled that matches should go ahead provided each team has a minimum of 13 players available and that teams who cannot play would suffer a forfeit.

368,2020/10/05,Additional supernumerary seats created to increase enrolment of female candidates in NIT-T,"Fifteen additional supernumerary seats have been created to increase enrolment of female candidates in National Institute of Technology - Tiruchi (NIT-T), under the centralised seat allocation procedure.

In order to ensure increase female enrolment in B.Tech. programmes of NITs for maintaining 20% strength, the intake of female students has been increased by creation of the supernumerary seats in the academic year 2020-21. Of the 1,036 seats to be filled in B.Tech/B.Arch programmes, 827 are gender neutral and 209 female only seats, NIT-T Director Mini Shaji Thomas said.

Till last year, verification of documents was conducted at the reporting centres. Due to COVID-19 pandemic this year, physical reporting has been eliminated. Instead, all the participating institutes have been made into verification centres. All the allotted candidates of the participating institute will be verified by the officials of those institutes, S. T. Ramesh, Chairman, UG Admissions Committee, NIT-T said.

Based on the JEE (main) rank, admission of candidates will be made to first year of engineering / technology and architecture / planning programmes in 31 NITs, IIEST Shibpur, 26 IIITs and 30 government funded technical institutes through a transparent process, under JoSAA (Joint Seat Allocation for Academic Programs)/ Central Seat Allocation Board (CSAB).

As physical reporting has been eliminated to maintain social distancing, a radical change has been inducted in business rules in terms of online reporting, online document verification and online admission, prioritising safety of the aspirants and stakeholders.

As per the JoSAA business rules, the candidate registration / choice filling for academic programmes starts on October 6, 2020 and ends on October 15, 2020.

369,2020/10/05,Plan to recruit guest lecturers for regular posts in govt. colleges dropped,"The State Government has reportedly abandoned a proposal to conduct a special drive to recruit eligible candidates from amongst guest lecturers in government colleges, to a certain number of regular vacancies.

The guest lecturers of government colleges and constituent units of State universities with requisite qualifications have, for long, been seeking preference in appointment to regular vacancies.

The move for special recruitment is understood to have been dropped amidst apprehensions raised by the academic fraternity about the perceived opaqueness in the process. The idea of a written exam has not been accepted as a robust mechanism.

During August, 2019, the Teachers Recruitment Board (TRB) had issued a notification inviting applications for direct recruitment from eligible candidates for the post of Assistant Professors in Tamil Nadu Collegiate Educational Service for filling 2,340 vacancies in Government Arts and Science Colleges and Colleges of Education.

A maximum of 15 marks are awarded to candidates for teaching experience, nine marks for Ph.D. in the subject concerned, six marks for M.Phil with NET/SLET, five marks for PG with NET/SLET, and 10 marks for interview.

Since the TRB could not proceed with the recruitment process this year due to the COVID lockdown since March, the Ministry of Higher Education had subsequently contemplated apportioning a certain number of vacancies for conduct of a special drive for recruiting candidates from amongst guest lecturers, and the Ministry had been pushing for issue of a government order to this effect, sources said. The idea was eventually dropped, sources said.

According to P. David Livingston, Tiruchi Zone Secretary of Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers’ Association, guest lecturers who have been in teaching service in government colleges for more than 10 years do deserve priority in the recruitment process. But, the idea of special recruitment drive does not make sense, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/plan-to-recruit-guest-lecturers-for-regular-posts-in-govt-colleges-dropped/article32775350.ece

Palur, two from Sendurai, three from Andimadam and 11 from Jayankondam blocks. One patient who travelled from another district also tested positive. Meanwhile, 970 new throat swabs were lifted from patients from containment zones, people with contact or travel history and from patients with symptoms of the infection.

The latest butterfly species that was recorded on Friday was the Dark Palm Dart, said a Forest Department official. The species could be commonly found in plains.

To attract butterfly species, about 300 species of host and nectar plants have been raised inside the 27-acre conservatory. The host plants raised inside the conservatory include lemon, False Ashoka, custard apple and curry leaf, while the nectar plants include Bauhinia purpurea, Zinnia peruvian and Ixora coccenia.

“During the North-East monsoon season, the conservatory with its green environment can be expected to attract more butterfly species,” said V. Muthukrishnan, a Junior Research Fellow working under the Forest Department at the conservatory.

377,2020/10/05,Authorities expect number of cases to dip in the coming days,"The Tiruchi district authorities expect the number of COVID-19 cases to drop over the next few weeks. Among the patients undergoing treatment, one-third are asymptomatic and mild cases and are under home quarantine, they said.

While the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital and other empanelled private hospitals are fully equipped to handle COVID-19 patients, most of the new cases are asymptomatic, and patients opt for home quarantine, S. Sivarasu, District Collector told The Hindu.

As on Sunday, a total of 463 patients were undergoing treatment at hospitals. While other 137 patients were in home quarantine,150 were in post-treatment home quarantine. “Earlier, most patients opted to undergo treatment at hospitals, or at the COVID Care Centre. But over the past few weeks, at least 60 to 70% of the patients were asymptomatic and are home quarantined. Most of them were detected through door-to-door testing and fever camps,” the Collector said.

The patients are provided with kabasura kudineer and multivitamin tablets, along with instructions on maintaining personal distance and dietary restrictions before being quarantined by health officers. Block Medical Officers continue to monitor the patients and have instructed them to call the ‘1077’ COVID-19 helpline in case of any health complications or emergency.

The district administration has pulled out all stops to contain the spread of the viral infection, and in Tiruchi the number of cases did not increase after easing of the lockdown norms on September 1, he said. “Nearly 99% of the patients who enter Tiruchi through the Tiruchi International Airport arrive with COVID-19 test reports. Only two or three patients are reported positive per day,” he said.

Tracking the trend in cases, Mr. Sivarasu said that within a week, the number of cases reported per day would reduce to 50. However, an additional COVID Care Centre and additional beds at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital are ready if necessary, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/o0d0d9/article32778848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY06CASESHOSPITALTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/authorities-expect-number-of-cases-to-dip-in-the-coming-days/article32774400.ece
378,2020/10/05,"Spoilt for choice, yet an integrated bus stand remains a distant dream","As ex-MP suggests yet another location to the long list of sites

While consensus eludes the choice of a suitable location for an integrated bus stand in the city, leaving the more than 25-year old proposal in limbo, former AIADMK Member of Parliament of Tiruchi, P. Kumar, has suggested that the terminus be established at Navalpattu, adding to the already long list of sites discussed for setting up the facility.

Navalpattu, where the ELCOT’s IT Park is situated, is about 15 km from the city off the Tiruchi- Pudukottai Highway.

Mr. Kumar, who aired the suggestion initially at an internal party meeting, told The Hindu that Navalpattu would be an ideal choice. “Once the (semi) ring road is ready, Navalpattu will be connected to almost all major highways. The place offers good scope for future development,” Mr. Kumar said and added that he intended to submit a written representation on this to Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswam soon.

Mr. Kumar’s suggestion comes in the wake of the continued failure of the district authorities and the State government to give a push to the project. Despite oft-repeated assurances, the Corporation and the State government have not been able to firm up a plan.

Down the years, successive governments have looked at various sites - Devadhanam off the Tiruchi-Chennai Bypass Road, the Ariyamangalam compost yard on the Tiruchi-Thanjavur road, Ramji Nagar on the Tiruchi-Dindigul national highway, Pirattiyur, Panchapur and finally Kottapattu on the Pudukottai national highway.

In October 2017, Mr. Palaniswami, during a visit to the city, announced that the bus stand would be established at Kottapattu. But the site was subsequently rejected. Later, the Corporation said that it would push for establishing a Bus Port with the support of the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. But this too has failed to take off.

Meanwhile, not many civic activists are enthused over Mr. Kumar’s suggestion. While underlining the need for establishing the bus stand at the earliest, M. Sekaran, president, Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations, and member of District Road Safety Council, observed that Navalpattu was too far away from the city and may not find wide acceptance among the public. “If pursued, it may turn out to become another Kallikudi (where an integrated market is struggling to become fully functional). The Panchapur site is much closer. We need a wider consultation to identify a suitable location,” Mr. Sekaran said pointing out that even smaller cities in the State have a much better bus stand than Tiruchi.

N. Ramakrishnan, a civic activist, alleged that the issue was being “needlessly distorted” and the project was getting delayed endlessly. For long, he had proposing the establishment of the bus stand on piece of land held by the Defence Ministry at Mannarpuram in the city. “We can get the site from the Ministry if only the matter is pursued properly,” he maintained.

Tiruchi MP Su.Thirunavukkarasu, while indicating that he was open to suggestions, said that he had raised the issue at two meetings held to discuss the Smart City Mission and even suggested that the project could be taken up under the Centre’s flagship programme. “I requested the Collector to identify a suitable site. He too has promised to do so soon. Once a site is identified and found suitable by officials, we will take the proposal forward and give shape to it,” he said and added that he will also take up the issue at the District Monitoring Committee to be held soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/dfwz5e/article32774243.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY06BUSSTANDTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/an-integrated-bus-stand-remains-a-distant-dream/article32774244.ece

To take this initiative forward, started eight years back, the association members will plant 5,000 more saplings this year in the next few days as a precursor to the 95th birth anniversary of Sri Sathya Sai Baba. A water project for the continued supply of water to the plants near the Hanuman Statue was inaugurated on Sunday by Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust Managing Trustee R.J. Rathnakar. Mr. Rathnakar also planted a sapling of Vatavriksha that was originally planted by Sri Sathya Sai Baba in 1959.

The tree plantation project started off in 2002 with just two saplings for which water had to be carried on motorbikes every day. In view of the water scarcity, arrangements were made to pump up water onto the top of the hill by recycling water from all the canteens in the ashram. In the later stages, few more tanks were built at strategic locations on the hilltop in such a way that less electricity was consumed and water erosion points were identified to dig small pits to store the rainwater. Today, this area houses quite a lot of beautiful peacocks, pigeons, parrots, and diverse species of birds.

383,2020/10/05,Be wary of fake job offers: ITAAP,"The IT Association of Andhra Pradesh (ITAAP) has cautioned prospective job seekers against falling a prey to fake placement agencies, which are trying to exploit gullible candidates by charging fee money.

In a statement on Sunday, ITAAP president Sreedhar Kosaraju noted that despite a temporary slowdown in hiring by the IT industry due to COVID-19 impact on the overall global economy, many companies are still continuing to hire in the State.

ITAAP has received multiple complaints from many IT companies in the recent past of such cheating incidents. Most of these incidents in the State are reported from the placement agencies located in the northern States.

The fake placement agencies first download candidates’ database from popular job portals. They generate fake offer letters matching the candidates’ profile on copied company letterheads, by pretending to be authorised placement agency of genuine IT companies. Then, calls are made to the target candidates to conduct fake interviews and their certificates are collected to offer the fake job.

They charge money from the candidates while sending the offer letter. Candidates are asked to pay through digital wallets like Paytm / Google Pay etc and after the payment is made they simply block the candidate phones.

Since they charge around ₹5,000 per offer the candidates have not yet approached the police. But such incidents are now showing an increasing trend.

Genuine IT companies and genuine placement agencies never ask for money. If any candidate suspects of such a fake offer, ITAAP recommends them to contact the company directly on the contact phone and mail IDs mentioned on the company website. Candidates can also write to info@theitaap.org if they receive any such fake offers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/be-wary-of-fake-job-offers-itaap/article32767996.ece

Speaking to the media here on Sunday, Mr. Hari said that he was annoyed by the large number of GVMC workers and policemen swooping on his residence in the early hours of Saturday.

He explained: “I uttered those words in a fit of rage and am sorry.”He, however, said that he was not afraid of anyone and he had apologised after realising that he had hurt the feelings of the officials, who were only doing their duty.

The TDP leader claimed those who came to demolish the constructions, told him that they were under pressure from above and expressed their helplessness. “My site was registered after the park wall was built. My building plan was also approved by the corporation authorities. How did they approve the plan, if it is an encroachment?”

“It is a private site, belonging to the person, who sold the land to me. I will send my documents to the GVMC Commissioner, let the officials verify and take a decision on it in 15 days. My lawyer had suggested that we should obtain a stay order from the court. But, I am against it as I have no objection, if they lay a road,” Mr. Hari said.

He also claimed that he had written a letter to the District Collector about a month ago saying that allegations were being made that he had encroached onto the park land and sought a probe to set the record straight. “There is no response from the Collector, so far, and I do not know whether he had received the letter or not,” Mr. Hari added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/sabbam-regrets-using-harsh-words-against-officials/article32767935.ece
387,2020/10/05,Amarnath slams TDP leaders for supporting Sabbam Hari,"‘Former MP grabbed government land in heart of the city’

Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath said it was unfortunate that TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu and other TDP leaders from Visakhapatnam supporting former MP and Mayor Sabbam Hari, who had allegedly grabbed government land worth nearly ₹3 crore in the heart of the city.

Coming down heavily on Mr. Hari for allegedly using derogatory words against Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Rajya Sabha MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy, Mr. Amarnath alleged that Mr. Hari had grabbed lands when he was the Mayor and the MP from this region and he had no right to speak against the Chief Minister.

Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, Mr. Amarnath said that the colony residents had complained to the corporation against the unauthorised construction by Mr. Hari. The GVMC had served notices on Mr. Hari several times asking him to vacate the government land.

When he did not do so, the GVMC officials demolished the illegal structure, the MLA said.

“How can the TDP leaders claim that it was vindictive act by the government?. The same procedure will apply to anyone who encroaches government land,” he said adding that Mr. Naidu had himself encroached upon land at Karrakatta near Vijayawada on the banks of Krishna River.

The MLA also said that the TDP leaders have been making false allegations against YSRCP leaders that they had encroached lands in Visakhapatnam right from the time the Chief Minister announced in December that Visakhapatnam would be made the Executive capital of the State. But, were they able to prove even a single allegation, he questioned. He also alleged that land scams had occurred in the city when the TDP government was in power.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/amarnath-slams-tdp-leaders-for-supporting-sabbam-hari/article32767909.ece

389,2020/10/05,NAD flyover project likely to be completed by November-end,"Ministers open route from Gajuwaka/airport to Gopalapatnam

The work on the much-awaited flyover project at the NAD Junction is going at a brisk pace. The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development (VMRDA), which is handling the project, said that almost 60% of the work has been completed and the target is to complete the project by the end of November.

The ₹150 crore worth project includes several components – Upper Rotary, Lower Rotary and other works. In Upper Rotary — the NAD flyover has four arms — from airport to NSTL route, towards Gopalapatnam, towards Marripalem and another arm from NSTL towards the airport.

According to the VMRDA officials, two arms of Upper Rotary — from the airport to the city and from Gopalapatnam — have been completed. The arm from Marripalem side is scheduled to be completed by October 15, while the second arm at the NSTL side was scheduled to be finished by October 31.

The second arm at the airport side is scheduled to be finished by November 15. The officials also said that lower rotary and other works are scheduled to be finished by November 30.

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Botcha Satyanarayana along with Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao and a few others opened the route from Gajuwaka/airport to Gopalapatnam on NAD flyover here on Sunday.

Mr. Satyanarayana said that already the route from Gajuwaka/airport to Thatichetlapalem has been opened to public and it has been helpful.

Now opening of the two routes would reduce traffic at the busy NAD Junction, he said.

VMRDA Commissioner P. Koteswara Rao explained the master plan of the project to the Minister.

Mr. Satyanarayana said that the project would be fast-tracked and will be opened for public.

391,2020/10/05,Catch author Revathi Suresh at IIHS’ Public Texts session on October 6,"She will be in conversation with author Shalini Srinivasan to talk about her new book, ‘In Now & Then’

As part of the Public Texts series by Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS), Shalini Srinivasan (author of Vanamala, the Cephalopod) will be in conversation with Revathi Suresh about her new book, In Now & Then, on October 6.

The book, a sequel to Jobless Clueless Reckless (2013), catches up with the characters, including the no-longer-a-teen protagonist Kavya; her younger brother, Dhrittiman aka Ditto; Amma and Appa; Mads and Mark, her aunt and uncle; Kiran, the blue-eyed boy Kavya has a crush on, and Lara, Kavya’s friend.

While Revathi says she finished writing the new book in 2018, there was no plan to always have a sequel. “When the first book got over, I pretty much thought I had finished the story. But then there were people who said, ‘Oh, it looks like there can be a sequel’. While I hesitated initially and thought where would that story go anyway, as the years passed, I could see that there was potential for a sequel for many reasons,” she says.

The new book deals with various subjects such as polyamory, gender identity and mental health. On whether her approach is to ensure that certain themes or subjects find a place in her writing, especially with regard to young people, Revathi says, “No, I don’t write that way. It doesn’t work for me to say at the starting point that I’m going to put all of these things in. The things that were happening in my mind were to do with the way that I could see young people living their lives or what they seemed to be going through. I am not saying as a collective, they are all going through this but just coming across something, such as in the news. It is no one I know and everyone I know.”

As for who the book is aimed at: young adults or older people, she says, “I don’t see it being pigeon-holed one way or the other. That the protagonist happens to be a certain age is one thing, but the fact is there are others around her who are not her age and are very much a part of her life. So, I think anyone of any age, any gender can read and enjoy it.”

392,2020/10/05,"Tasmanian devils return to mainland Australia after 3,000 years","It is estimated that fewer than 25,000 Tasmanian devils still live in the wild, down from as many as 1,50,000 before the mysterious, fatal disease first struck in the mid-1990s.

Tasmanian devils have been released into the wild on Australia's mainland 3,000 years after the feisty marsupials went extinct there, in what conservationists described Monday as a “historic” step.

Aussie Ark, along with a coalition of other conservation groups, revealed Monday that they had released 26 of the carnivorous mammals into a 1,000-acre sanctuary at Barrington Tops, about 3.5 hours north of Sydney.

Tim Faulkner, president of Aussie Ark, said the “historic” releases in July and September were the first steps in a project akin to the successful move to return wolves to Yellowstone National Park in the United States in the 1990s.

After 16 years of work, including the establishment of mainland Australia's largest Tasmanian devil breeding programme, Faulkner said it was “incredible and surreal” to have reached the goal.

“It's the stuff dreams are made of,” he told AFP. “Our biggest native mainland predator is the tiger quoll — and they're just over a kilo — so to be bringing back something of this enormity is huge.”

Tasmanian devils, which weigh up to 8 kilograms and have a black or brown coat, typically prey on other native animals or scavenge carcasses.

According to government environmental authorities, they are not dangerous to humans or livestock but will defend themselves if attacked and can cause serious injury.

The animals — known for their extremely loud growl, powerful jaws and ferocity when confronting rivals over food or mates — are classified as endangered after a contagious facial tumour disease ravaged the remaining population on the Australian island state of Tasmania.

It is estimated that fewer than 25,000 Tasmanian devils still live in the wild, down from as many as 1,50,000 before the mysterious, fatal disease first struck in the mid-1990s.

On Australia's mainland, they are believed to have been wiped out by packs of dingoes — wild dogs native to the vast continent — an estimated 3,000 years ago.

'Slice of Tasmania'

Faulkner said it was hoped the project would create an “insurance population” against the face-tumour disease, which has so far proved untreatable, and help restore the native environment.

“Devils present one of the only natural solutions to the control of fox and the cat, and the fox and cat are responsible for nearly all of our 40 mammal extinctions (in Australia),” he added. “So there's more than the devil at stake here.”

Aussie Ark selected the reintroduced devils for their breeding suitability, placing them in the sprawling, fenced area in the hopes of warding off threats to their survival including feral pests, noxious weeds and cars.

“We've put young, healthy devils in, we put them in now which gives them the best part of six months to settle, find their territory (and) prepare for breeding” which usually occurs in February, Faulkner said.

Another 40 are set to be released over the next two years into the sanctuary, which is on land bought by Aussie Ark for its habitat suitability, high number of herbivores and location near a national park.

“The land initially was selected because it's just like a slice of Tasmania,” Faulkner said.

He said he was confident that close monitoring as the Tasmanian devils make the “massive transition” back to the wild — where they have no supplied food, water or shelter for the first time in their lives — would ensure the programme's early success.

As part of the “ambitious” rewilding scheme, Aussie Ark plans to eventually introduce more of the animals to unfenced areas, where they will contend with a much greater range of new threats including the country's notorious bushfires.

The Tasmanian devil is one of seven cornerstone species critical to Australia's ecosystem that Aussie Ark plans to reintroduce to the wild sanctuary in the coming years, along with quolls, bandicoots and rock wallabies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/z828q/article32771705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0008RD9JU,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/tasmanian-devils-return-to-mainland-australia-after-3000-years/article32771707.ece
393,2020/10/05,New family of bony fish discovered in Western Ghats,"Many of these species are blind, pigment-less, and have peculiar morphological characters that are otherwise not seen in species occurring in surface waters.

Scientists from India, Germany, United Kingdom and Switzerland have discovered a new family of bony fish from the Western Ghats, and named it Aenigmachannidae.

Results of this study was published in Scientific Reports, the open-access mega-journal of the Nature Publishing Group.

A year after the discovery of the enigmatic Gollum Snakehead, Aenigmachanna gollum from the rice fields of northern Kerala, scientists have now conducted detailed studies on its skeleton and genetic assembly.

The study led to the recognition that this species, and its congener Aenigmachanna mahabali, represents a new family different from Channidae, in which both species were initially placed.

Now it's time for some fishy animation!! Have a look at the skull of the weirdo #gollumsnakehead #livingfossil #Aenigmachannidae



For those who have not yet checked out the super cool paper, have a look at https://t.co/fWFeMWUgP1 pic.twitter.com/qsr0F9Jdz3 — Rajeev Raghavan (@LabRajeev) October 3, 2020

Rendered images obtained from high-resolution CT scans revealed that Aenigmachanna gollum has a surprisingly large number of primitive characters, and detailed molecular phylogenetic analyses including of its mitogenome, suggested an ancient separation from Channidae, the study said.

These suggest that members of Aenigmachannidae are “living fossils” and comprise an ancient gondwanan lineage that survived the break-up of the supercontinent and the northward drift of the Indian subcontinent, about 100 million years ago, it added.

Assistant Professor at the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies, Rajeev Raghavan, who was part of the study, said the recognition of Aenigmachannidae as a new family of bony fishes comes six years after the description of Kryptoglanidae, another unique family of freshwater fish endemic to Kerala. “The presence of two unique endemic families of freshwater fish in a small region like Kerala is unparalleled, and indicates the exceptional diversity and endemicity of fishes in this part of the world,” said Raghavan.

The gollum snakehead, Aenigmachanna gollum and the mahabali snakehead, Aenigmachanna mahabali are known to occur in the aquifers and subterranean channels connected to paddy fields and dug-out wells in Malappuram and Pathanamthitta districts of Kerala.

While Aenigmachanna gollum was discovered by pure chance in a rice field not long after the devastating floods that raged in Kerala in August 2018, Aenigmachanna mahabali was discovered opportunistically from a dug-out well.

“The aquifers of Kerala have a wealth of enigmatic and relic fauna, the diversity of which we are only slowly uncovering. But subterranean ecosystems are under high levels of threat due to indiscriminate ground water extraction and pollution, and introduction of alien species in the dugout wells. As a result, we may be losing unique habitats and species much before they are known to science” said Neelesh Dahanukar, Research Scientist at the IISER, Pune, who co-authored the paper.

According to scientists, the subterranean ecosystems of Kerala harbour some of the planet’s most bizarre species such as Horaglanis krishnaii, Kryptoglanis shajii, Aenigmachanna gollum and Monopterus digressus.

Many of these species are blind, pigment-less, and have peculiar morphological characters that are otherwise not seen in species occurring in surface waters. Around 10 such enigmatic species of subterranean fish are currently known from Kerala, the scientists said.

“Throughout my career I have worked on many strange fishes, but the Gollum Snakehead is easily the weirdest of them all. If I had been asked whether such a fish existed in the Western Ghats or anywhere in the world, I would have said, no way. Yet here it is,” remarked Ralf Britz, based at the Senckenberg Museum at Dresden, Germany, who led this paper.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/yds2z9/article32771041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EjJh3fVoAMUiLE-1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/new-family-of-bony-fish-discovered-in-western-ghats/article32771042.ece
394,2020/10/05,Two new plant species discovered in Western Ghats,"Identification of the species belonging to Eriocaulon is very difficult as they all look similar, which is why the genus is often referred to as a ‘Taxonomist’s nightmare’

Scientists from the Agharkar Research Institute in Pune have recently discovered two new species of pipeworts in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra and Karnataka, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) said on Sunday.

The species reported from Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra has been named Eriocaulon parvicephalum (due to its minute inflorescence size), and the other reported from Kumta, Karnataka is called Eriocaulon karaavalense (named after Karaavali, Coastal Karnataka region), it said.

Pipeworts (Eriocaulon) is a plant group which completes its life cycle within a small period during monsoon. It exhibits great diversity in the Western Ghats.

Around 111 species of pipeworts are found in India. Most of these are reported from the Western Ghats and the eastern Himalayas, and around 70% of them are endemic to the country.

Scientists from @ari_pune, an autonomous institute of @IndiaDST has found 2 new species of the plant group pipeworts (Eriocaulon).

“One species, Eriocaulon cinereum, is well known for its anti-cancerous, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and astringent properties. E. quinquangulare is used against liver diseases. E. madayiparense is an anti-bacterial from Kerala. The medicinal properties of the newly discovered species are yet to be explored,” the DST said.

The new species were discovered while exploring the biodiversity of the Western Ghats.

The scientists wanted to trace the evolutionary history of the genus Eriocaulon and made extensive efforts to collect as many species as possible from India, especially from the Western Ghats, the DST said.

“While critically examining our collection, we came across two accessions, which showed different floral characters than earlier known species. Hence, we studied morphology and its DNA to confirm the novelty,” said Ritesh Kumar Choudhary, the lead author of a study on the new species.

The study was published in ‘Phytotaxa’ and ‘Annales Botanici Fennici’ journals, the DST said.

Identification of the species belonging to Eriocaulon is very difficult as they all look similar, which is why the genus is often referred to as a ‘Taxonomist’s nightmare’

Its tiny flowers and seeds make it difficult to distinguish between different species, Choudhary pointed out.

Choudhary’s PhD student Ashwini Darshetkar said, “Future studies will focus on elucidating the evolutionary history of the genus in India. A thorough investigation of the phylogenetic relationship between all Indian species would also help in prioritising the conservation of threatened species in India.”

“We are also trying to develop DNA barcodes, which will enable us to identify the species with just a portion of the leaf,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/5e5h04/article32770884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/plant,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/two-new-plant-species-discovered-in-western-ghats/article32770885.ece
395,2020/10/05,Explained: 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,"Their discovery has helped develop antiviral drugs directed at hepatitis C.

The 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was jointly awarded to Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice for the discovery of Hepatitis C virus.

What is Hepatitis C virus?

Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus and causes Hepatitis C disease which affects the liver. According to WHO, “globally, an estimated 71 million people have chronic hepatitis C virus infection and a significant number develop cirrhosis or liver cancer.""

In 2016, it was estimated that approximately 3,99,000 people died globally from hepatitis C.

How did they discover a new virus?

Harvey J. Alter who was studying hepatitis in patients who had received blood transfusions, found many unexplained infections. Tests for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B virus infection showed that they were not the cause. His team demonstrated that blood from these patients could transmit the disease to chimpanzees, and more studies showed that an unknown infectious agent was behind this. The mysterious new illness was termed “non-A, non-B” hepatitis.

This new virus could not be isolated for several years using the traditional techniques for virus isolation. Michael Houghton and his team created a collection of DNA fragments from the blood of an infected chimpanzee and thoroughly searched it. They found a novel RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus family and named it the Hepatitis C virus.

To understand if this new virus alone could cause hepatitis, Charles M. Rice used genetic engineering, generated an RNA variant of the virus and injected it into the liver of chimpanzees. The virus was detected in the blood and the chimpanzees exhibited changes similar to those seen in humans with the disease. This was the final proof that the virus alone was the cause behind the unexplained cases of transfusion-mediated hepatitis.

Americans Harvey J Alter and Charles M Rice, and British scientist Michael Houghton were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology on Monday for the discovery of the hepatitis C virus.

Announcing the prize in Stockholm on Monday, the Nobel Committee noted that the trio’s work helped explain a major source of blood-borne hepatitis that couldn’t be explained by the hepatitis A and B viruses.

Their work make possible blood tests and new medicines that have saved millions of lives, the committee said.

Thanks to their discovery, highly sensitive blood tests for the virus are now available and these have essentially eliminated post-transfusion hepatitis in many parts of the world, greatly improving global health, the committee said.

Their discovery also allowed the rapid development of antiviral drugs directed at hepatitis C, it added. For the first time in history, the disease can now be cured, raising hopes of eradicating hepatitis C virus from the world population.

The World Health Organisation estimates there are over 70 million cases of hepatitis worldwide and 400,000 deaths each year. The disease is chronic and a major cause of liver inflammation and cancer.

The prestigious Nobel award comes with a gold medal and prize money of 10 million Swedish kronor (over USD 1,118,000), courtesy of a bequest left 124 years ago by the prize’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.

The medicine prize carried particular significance this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has highlighted the importance that medical research has for societies and economies around the world.

No prizes are expected to be awarded this year for work directly linked to the new coronavirus, as Nobel prizewinning research usually takes many years to be verified.

The prize-awarding committees are ""not in any way influenced by what is happening in the world at the time,"" Erling Norrby, the former permanent secretary of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences which awards the science prizes, told AFP. ""It takes time before a prize can mature, I would say at least 10 years before you can fully understand the impact"" of a discovery, Norrby, himself a virologist, said.

The work of the various prize committees is shrouded in secrecy and the names of the nominees are not disclosed for 50 years, leading to rampant speculation.

T-cells, breast cancer, scissors?

Swedish public radio SR and the country's biggest daily Dagens Nyheter both suggested Monday's medicine prize could go to French-born Australian Jacques Miller and Max Cooper of the U.S. for their discoveries of T-cells and B-cells in the 1960s, which led to breakthroughs in cancer and virus research. The pair won the prestigious Lasker Prize in the U.S. last year.
