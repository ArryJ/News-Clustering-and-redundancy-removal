0,2020/10/04,Police teams raid five pubs in Bengaluru,"The Central Crime Branch, which is probing the drug racket, carried out surprise checks on five pubs across Bengaluru on Saturday night. The raids were carried out by several teams simultaneously with the intention of busting drug dealers, but officials did not get any incriminating evidence.

The raids were carried out based on the information provided by two peddlers, Varun and Vinod, who were arrested from their apartment in Sanjay Nagar on Saturday in connection with the case.

Varun reportedly told the police that he was supplying drugs to his contacts for weekend parties. “He has given us names of his contacts including actors, businessmen and realtors. We are verifying this information,” said a CCB official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-teams-raid-five-pubs-in-bengaluru/article32767201.ece
1,2020/10/04,BDA’s move to sell CA sites opposed,"Social activists and citizens groups have vehemently opposed the Bangalore Development Authority’s (BDA) decision of selling over 1,400 civic amenity (CA) sites currently leased to private and government bodies in and around the city.

Based on State government’s order, BDA has already initiated the process by accepting application from lessees interested in buying the property. Activists urged the government to effectively manage and monitor its asset to generate funds and not sell them.

B.M. Shivakumar, president, Jayaprakash Narayan Vichara Vedike and an RTI activist, said that selling of CA sites would lead to “unconditional third party interests.” “I do not think that the BDA has made an assessment of the implication of selling CA sites to the lessees. Hundreds of sites are at prime locations in the city and why would the Government want to sell them to private parties. Had the BDA maintained all its properties well, it would have been one of the richest government agencies. What will the BDA have if they sell everything they have?” he asked, adding that there were many occupants of CA sites who had not paid the lease amount amounting to crores to the government.

He also added that such measures would benefit only a handful of people with money and muscle power who will manage to get the CA sites for a much lesser price.

K. Ramesh, a property consultant and president of Bengaluru South Citizens’ Forum, said that by foregoing such valuable property, the BDA and the State government would lose their net worth. “They are setting a very bad precedence by selling everything in the name of fund generation. Finally, the government will not be able to raise loans as it will have only a few assets leading to increase in liability and almost no assets,” he said.

An activist who did not want to be named said that it was the responsibility of the Government to provide civic amenities and by selling CA sites, they were depriving the public of their fundamental rights. “Instead, such CA sites can be used for government hospitals, fire stations or other important issue. Hundreds of government offices are paying lakhs of office rent. When such is the case, why should the government sell its CA sites,” the activist questioned.

The Karnataka High Court recently restrained BDA from auctioning intermediary sites that was being done to generate funds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bdas-move-to-sell-ca-sites-opposed/article32763145.ece

3,2020/10/04,Rowdy-sheeter shot at,"The Sampigehalli police on Saturday morning opened fire on a 26-year-old rowdy-sheeter who was on the run after splashing boiling edible oil on a shopkeeper’s face when she demanded money for the cigarettes he had purchased from her.

“The accused, Syed Haneef, is a resident of Amarjyothi Layout. He attacked the owner of the shop, Megahala, and later a driver Srinivas in separate incidents on Wednesday night. He has been on the run since then,” said a police officer.

According to the police, Haneef has multiple cases pending against him and was harassing people in the area. On Wednesday, he stopped at Meghala’s shop, asked for a packet of cigarettes, took them and started walking away. She called him back and insisted that he pay her or return the cigarettes. The two started arguing, and Haneef reportedly splashed hot oil on her face. “The oil was outside the shop where Meghala served bhajjis,” the police added. Haneef escaped from the spot while passers-by came to the victim’s aid and took her to Victoria Hospital. The same day, the accused along with his associate stopped a car and assaulted the driver in an attempt to rob him. “We intensified our search operations for Haneef and traced him to an isolated place near Sampigehalli in the wee hours of Saturday where he had taken shelter. However, he attacked police personnel in an attempt to escape. The inspector leading the team gave him a warning and fired at his legs to stop him,” said the police officer.

The city police have stepped up their vigil to keep a check on rowdies and anti-social elements following strict instruction from Police Commissioner Kamal Pant. As many as seven rowdies have been arrested under the Goonda Act and remanded into judicial custody in September alone. “This is to ensure that they would not get bail for at least one year,” said a senior police officer .",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/rowdy-sheeter-shot-at/article32763110.ece

8,2020/10/04,Man dies after bid to set fire to family of girl,"22-year-old had come from Ariyalur

A 22-year-old man ended his life after he attempted to set fire to the family of a girl whom he claimed he loved, near her house in Valasaravakkam in the early hours on Saturday.

The deceased has been identified as G Jeevanandam, 22, a graduate in agricultural science and a native of Ariyalur. The girl, aged 21, is a final year student of the same course. Last year, they met at a cultural event in Gujarat and became friends. Jeevanandam visited her house whenever he came to the city.

He came to her house a few days ago and continued to stay without any plan of leaving. On Friday night, when the girl’s parents asked him to vacate, he told them that he would leave the next morning. He later told them that she should not marry anyone else and added that he would also remain single.

At 3.15 a.m., he woke up and pulled out a gas cylinder from the kitchen to the hall and attempted to kill them by opening it and setting it on fire. The girl and her parents came out from their bedroom on hearing a noise and had a scuffle with him. They finally pushed him out of the house and locked the door. The girl and her mother had minor burns on the head, the police said.

The family contacted the city police control room for assistance. Before the arrival of police personnel to the spot, Jeevandham inflicted injury on himself and was lying unconscious near the house. He was sent to Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, where the doctors declared him brought dead.

9,2020/10/04,Kasimedu harbour’s lack of hygiene irks fishermen,"‘Port Trust has no cleaning regiment’

It’s just been a month or so since the Kasimedu fishing harbour was cleaned by the Fisheries Department but the wharfs and empty spaces are already littered with broken boat parts and rubbish.

This is due to the lack of no cleaning regimen for the harbour that gets close to 30,000 visitors daily. “There is no cleaning mechanism. People just sweep up their spaces whenever they can. But without bins to dump the waste, sweeping or removing the waste does not matter,” said Vinod, who along with the police and a band of youngsters, had removed 300 tonnes of waste from the fishing harbour last year.

Arasu, president of a boat owners’ association, said the harbour was under the control of the Chennai Port Trust and that they were collecting wharf charges regularly. “Nobody knows what happens to that money. The port does not want to take charge of the cleanliness, lighting or water supply inside the harbour. Control must be handed over to the Fisheries Department,” he said.

No exports

M.D. Dayalan of the Indian Fishermen Association said due to the lack of cleanliness, fish exports do not happen here. “We have been banned by the European Union due to a lack of hygiene. We send fish to Cochin from where they are exported, which is unfair to the fishermen here since they don’t get good rates for their catch.”

He also added that unless regular cleaning was taken up, crores of money invested by the State government to improve infrastructure would be ruined.

Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said a system would be put in place soon to clean the fishing harbour. “We will maintain our assets,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5btl98/article32763403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THKASIMEDUFISHING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kasimedu-harbours-lack-of-hygiene-irks-fishermen/article32763404.ece
10,2020/10/04,"Despite COVID-19, startups draw funding","Companies in Tamil Nadu raise $439 million across 22 deals in the first nine months

Startups in Tamil Nadu raised $439 million in the first nine months of 2020 across 22 deals. During the same period last year, State-based startups attracted Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) investments to the tune of $1,331 million across 39 deals, according to data provided by Venture Intelligence, a research service focused on private company financials, transactions and their valuations.

Despite uncertainty in the market due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this quarter (Q3) witnessed six deals amounting to $108 million.

“While the PE-VC investment figures are down on a year-on-year basis, recent weeks have shown that both foreign PE-VC investors (notably, U.S.-headquartered investors like Falcon Edge Capital – which led the $4.5-million investment in Hippo Video) as well as well-established India-dedicated funds are keen to make new investment bets. This general ‘loosening of purse strings’ is likely to improve funding access for Chennai/Tamil Nadu-based companies as well,” said Arun Natarajan, founder of Venture Intelligence.

For the first nine months of this year, Tamil Nadu managed to get 17 angel investments. In 2019, the State had 11 angel investments for the same period. During this third quarter, the State saw seven angel investments while there were only 3 that came in during the same time last year. Mr. Natarajan explained that right now, owing to the impact of the pandemic, digitally native companies in edtech, fintech, entertainment and e-commerce sectors are attracting a lion’s share of PE-VC investments.

“Tamil Nadu-based companies in the financial services and fintech space are likely to attract more attention in the current environment.

""As investor confidence improves, startups in this region which are especially strong in the enterprise software and deep tech segment are likely to witness more investments flowing their way,” he added.

According to Mr. Natarajan, the vibrancy of the capital markets (including the very successful IPOs of Chennai-based CAMS and Bangalore-based IT Services firm Happiest Minds), should also encourage more mature companies from the region to look at the IPO route to raise capital. The analysis done by the Venture Intelligence team shows that at the national level PE-VC firms invested $26.3 billion across 547 deals in the first nine months of 2020.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cwd89i/article32763387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Startup,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/despite-covid-19-startups-draw-funding/article32763388.ece
11,2020/10/04,Tribunal asks MTC to pay ₹2.05 lakh compensation to flower vendor,"The woman was hurt in accident on July 16, 2016

The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Chennai, has directed the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) to pay compensation of about ₹2.05 lakh to a flower vendor injured in a road accident four years ago.

In her petition, Ponnammal said on July 16, 2016, when she was walking along the R.G. Salai near Tharamani SRP tools, an MTC bus hit her.

As a result, the petitioner said she was injured and alleged that the bus driver was responsible for the accident and sought compensation from MTC.

In its reply, MTC denied the allegations and said the bus driver tried to alert the pedestrian by sounding horn and applied brakes, in vain.

The transport utility claimed that the driver was not responsible for the accident.

The tribunal ruled that the petitioner had proved her case while the MTC driver had not produced proper evidence and not taken steps to quash the said FIR filed against him.

Based on the medical records and FIR it said the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the driver of the MTC bus and awarded the compensation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tribunal-asks-mtc-to-pay-205-lakh-compensation-to-flower-vendor/article32763375.ece
12,2020/10/04,10 major firms show interest in Metro Rail phase II tunnelling,"China Railway Tunnel Group, Shanghai Urban Construction Group among them

Nearly 10 firms, including those from China, have expressed interest in executing carrying out the tunnelling work on a crucial stretch of Chennai Metro Rail phase II project.

Among the companies evincing interest are China Railway Tunnel Group, Shanghai Urban Construction Group, L&T, Hindustan Construction Company, Tata Projects, Afcons Infrastructure Ltd., and Turkey-based Gulermak. Their representatives attended a pre-bid meeting held. Now, in a few weeks, the companies have to submit their bids, sources said.

The mammoth 119-km ₹69,000-crore phase II project of the Metro Rail will have underground network and elevated ones. But the focus will be to start the tunnelling work because it takes a long time to finish it.

Initial tender

At first, Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) had floated two tenders for two underground sections — the 9-km Venugopal Nagar-Kellys stretch and another 12-km Kellys-Taramani stretch.

According to CMRL officials, the tender should be finalised and awarded in two months. “We are hoping to start the tunnelling work in these two stretches by early next year. The work will commence in different locations simultaneously but we will plan it in such a way that commuters are not put to inconvenience,” an official said.

But sources said, owing to COVID-19 pandemic, some companies were apprehensive about coming down to the city and carrying out the construction work.

Meanwhile, CMRL will float tenders for building the stations in this 21-km Venugopal Nagar-Taramani stretch. Unless CMRL plans the construction well for this 119-km project and finishes it on time, commuting through key localities of the city will be a major issue for thousands of residents.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rw8yf9/article32763359.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/10-major-firms-show-interest-in-metro-rail-phase-ii-tunnelling/article32763360.ece

14,2020/10/04,MTC plans app for real time info on buses,"Transport Department plans to extend the facility to the entire State

Commuters in the city will soon be able to track buses of the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC), Chennai, on their mobile phones through the Locate and Access My Bus (LAMB) app.

Live tracking of the buses has been made available in a third-party Chalo app on a trial basis.

GPS-based system

A senior official of MTC said the project aims at providing passenger information system (PIS) using global positioning system (GPS) technology for the commuters to access the availability of buses through a mobile app.

“The app is almost ready with the fixing of GPS in 3,200 buses. The live tracking of buses is available under a beta version in Chalo app and once fully completed, it will be migrated to the LAMB app,"" he said. The COVID-19 lockdown has been used to fix the GPS equipment in all buses when they were idle. “At present, under the beta version, the accuracy of the arrival time of buses is being checked and once the accuracy rate is under one or two minutes, LAMB would be launched,” he said.

The MTC officials said that under the LAMB mobile app, more than 3,500 bus stops and 700 routes have been geo-coded. Users can track the arrival of five buses with route numbers in real time at any bus stop, locate the bus route and list nearest bus stops.

Live tracking

The live tracking of buses would be available for the commuters on the MTC website www.mtcbus.tn.gov.in once the LAMB app is launched.

The project is part of the larger fleet management project called Intelligent Transport Management System (ITMS) to be executed under the Chennai Smart City project.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/v36jbp/article32763240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THMTCBUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mtc-plans-app-for-real-time-info-on-buses/article32763241.ece

Ethiopian Shura Kitata outsprinted Kenya’s Vincent Kipchumba to win a thrilling London Marathon on Sunday as a stunned World record holder Eliud Kipchoge faded late in the race to suffer his first defeat since 2013.

16,2020/10/04,Corona and lean weddings,"Indian weddings till March were just big and fat and considered events to show off wealth.

The big fat Indian wedding industry is suffering a great loss during corona times. However, it is a blessing to many that corona virus has restricted the wedding guests to fewer than 50. In fact, the people who had hesitated to get married with fewer than 1,000 guests a few years ago are getting hitched with just 20-30 spectators. It not only saves a lot of expenses but also helps avoid unwanted comments and hard feelings among family members.

Traditionally, Indian weddings are known for their varied customs and rituals. Generally in olden days, the weddings took place in the house. As soon as the wedding date is announced, the entire family goes into festive mode. People go for wedding shopping which involves gold jewellery, silver articles, vessels, silk saris and so on. Sweets and savouries are made to last until many days after the wedding.

Once everything is set, the ceremonies begin. In many places in South India, the wedding takes place in the bride’s house. At least 10 days before the wedding, a hole is dug in front of the house of the bride, a bamboo pole is placed in the hole and people perform puja to it praying for a peaceful and happy wedding. Typically, bamboo poles are used to create the marquee (large tent) under which weddings are performed and the guests seated. Hence the first bamboo pole which is placed on the ground is worshipped by applying turmeric, kumkum, torans and flowers. Nine ladies are considered auspicious to perform the ritual. It is also a symbol to convey to the people that there is an upcoming wedding in the house.

After this, the bride and the groom are not allowed to leave the house. This is to protect them from the “evil eye” or unwelcome incidents. They are taken care of like kings and queens. They are provided with good and healthy home-cooked meals and turmeric and mehendi are applied on them.

Vegetables and fruits are bought in bulk a few days before the wedding. All the family members gather at the wedding venue one day prior to the wedding to prepare the feast. As the food is cooked by family members with love and affection, it is devoured with great joy and happiness. The bride and the groom fast on the day of the wedding as a prayer for peaceful and happy wedding. It also helps cope with the stress and nervousness that they endure on that day.

Finally when the wedding day arrives, all the family members are dressed in traditional attire, they wear gold jewellery and the women fill their hair with flowers and they all have happy faces. The sound of Tavil, Nadhaswaram and Mridangam fills the air. When it is time for muhurtham, the groom ties the knot with a simple yellow thread with turmeric tied to it. Flowers and blessings shower from all directions on the newly wed couple. As the bride leaves for the groom’s place, she is sent with the sweets and savouries prepared for her before the wedding.

That was a happy Indian wedding that had the families close together. They were so involved in the weddings that they hardly had time to notice imperfections.

However, for long years until March, Indian weddings were just big and fat and considered events to show off wealth. They had jealous people and nitpickers who by their actions not only humiliated themselves but also caused immense stress in the minds of the hosts.

Coronavirus has come as a boon to many Indian families who can now safely avoid such people and expenses, not just for weddings but for other functions as well. I wish this became the new normal and stayed on forever.

17,2020/10/04,Longing for a jaunty bus ride,"The buses are back on the roads, but they are not back to their pre-COVID crowded selves.

I saw a bus rumbling by the other day while returning home from work. The sight of something so innocuous, so reminiscent of the days before the lockdown came as a shock to me. I am not ashamed to say that I gaped. Even after reading about the resumption of bus services in the news, seeing an actual bus let my eyes widen as I watched the austere brown behemoth pass.

I noted with some disappointment that it did not have its usual leftward tilt. A characteristic of the rush hours of morning, when students and workers alike would be crammed on the stairs of the bus, forcing one side of the bus downwards. The stairwell is an interesting ecosystem, in my experience. We were always busy in there; either with books for last-minute studying or phones to distract from the day ahead. Amid this, people would cling onto each other, in a shared brotherhood as we tried to avoid falling off the bus. Ironic that we must cling to each other from a distance now.

There would always be one elderly statesman with a large sack of textiles or vegetables — the brotherhood of the stairwell was always gracious in making space for them. There were some cracks in their unity though, when they had to clamber down at each stop to allow people to get off and on. Words were exchanged, hands waved, the bus conductor usually charges an extra 50 for the extra weight. Off again before the idly watching traffic policeman makes his way here. It happens again the very next day.

The veterans are the people who would complete a long journey on the bus by just holding onto the window grilles on the sides with their teeth as well as hands. They can be seen with half their body swaying outside the bus. They would still have their earphones plugged in and Instagram open on their phones. I once saw a person performing the difficult task of sharing a video just as a lorry whizzed by, inches away. To whom? Someone important, I hope.

Then there’s me. I usually have my face pressed against the glass of the foldable doors of the stairwell. I’ve travelled a fair bit on the bus, but I lack the recklessness to hang out with the veterans. I also lack the courage to face my boss for being late after waiting for a less-crowded bus. You know, like a sensible person. Go figure.

I usually read the news while I’m on the stairwell. I don’t need my phone for it either. Every day, with great precision, posters carrying the front covers and top stories of magazines are plastered onto walls, bridges and the sides of other buses. Sometimes on the doors of the green toilets too. The news that really matters is covered by these magazines.

I once read that ‘Life is a train journey’ back when I was in school. You meet a lot of people and you get off at your stop. I reckon though, life is more like a bus journey. There are too many people in a hurry and too few seats. You do meet people, but the chances of a missed connection are quite high. As for getting off at your right stop, the rule of thumb is that if you haven’t wasted half-an-hour taking a bus in the opposite direction after overshooting your destination by at least three stops, you’re not doing it right.

Still, what I’d do for those days to have never been interrupted.

18,2020/10/04,Of digital communities,"From politics to poverty and religious fundamentalism to climate change, the exchanges are mostly contemporary.

Widely derided for the problems it causes, from silly good morning graphics to fake news, WhatsApp doesn’t easily get its due. Those who unlock the endearing possibilities of the app are busy celebrating the experience and may not pause to marvel at the enabling technology. WhatsApp-for-good, however, is too ubiquitous to miss.

Look at the countless groups of school or college mates out there. To dismiss them as fluffy nostalgia with a digital topping would be a mistake, as they are a unique social experiment.

It may sound counter-intuitive that a WhatsApp group of classmates of the 1980s or 1990s doesn’t over-obsess about their olden times. Memories may have brought them together, but reminiscence is not an everyday activity past their brief formative phase.

Such digital communities on WhatsApp soon become sites of contemporary discussions conducted with the camaraderie of the past. From politics to poverty and religious fundamentalism to climate change, the exchanges are mostly contemporary with ample time spent on personal stories alongside. It is as if a community that dissolved a couple of decades ago, suddenly resurfaced and resumed life in a drastically new environment. Such classmates’ groups aren’t comparable to alumni meetings of the physical world where a group of old pals gather, spend a few hours reliving their past, make merry and go home. While alumni meetings are about invoking the past to wish away the present, digital communities of classmates use the past to re-establish a lost community transposed in time. The former stoke up memories, the latter confront the present.

Jean Baudrillard talks about hyper-reality as a representation without an original referent. A WhatsApp group of people who were classmates a couple of decades ago, represents a reality with a disputable “original”. The hyper-real digital community is connected to a corresponding group of people that existed but with incomparable identities. For example, a group admin who is an affluent software engineer living in a metro with a right-leaning political ideology was in school, a leftist leader from a village with meagre financial means. Similarly, every member would have become almost a different individual, going through life-altering transformations. So, the connection between the virtual group and its putative original is ridden with contradictions than similarities.

What is even more remarkable is that the cultural artefacts of their daily exchange, voice messages, short videos, smileys, trolls, memes, GIFs and so on were non-existent in their “original” group. Nevertheless, they reconfigure themselves with the new language.

It is equally interesting to think of the purpose and activities of such groups. There is no lofty common purpose for them. They share a wide range of personal matters including joyful incidents and sorrowful experiences, work-related issues and success stories, news from family, academics of their children and so on, besides airing views and commentary about public affairs in general. Many members also find the group a reason to reconnect with their long-lost creative talent in singing, painting, acting and so on. It is not uncommon to see those who stopped singing as they left their student life recording new songs with karaoke and sharing within their WhatsApp groups to the applause or teasing of their former

classmates. In general, several attributes of one’s identity that faded over time are recovered and reactivated.

Whereas the original student community was the byproduct of an institutional purpose, its digital reincarnation exists for its own sake. The absence of institutional formality enables a lot of people to seek gratifications that can’t be realised elsewhere. The original student community was not bashful about their naked souls and the mutuality was less conditioned by the external world. In its digital version, people try to preserve their primal intimacy against all cues of their current life, often creating an atmosphere of emotional safety in a world of disruptions and uncertainties. This, despite, all of them having been transformed into unrecognisably different selves. It is the triumph of becoming over being, that Frederick Nietzsche would have been pleased to witness.

Unlike other WhatsApp groups with a coexisting, real-world equivalent, the digital tribe of erstwhile communities may report individuals showing a dilution of their acquired toxicities — communal, socio-economic or cultural.

19,2020/10/04,The monsoon session,"Sadly missing was the pretty ritual of going up the dais to shake the presiding officer’s hand.

Speaking in Parliament while seated mask-muffled behind glass shields did not suit the panache of MPs. Some of them stood up by force of habit and others lowered the guard to have a better voice. The dam ultimately burst when a member came out spewing fire and brimstone against the alleged linking of Bollywood with drug trafficking by a member of the other House, in clear violation of parliamentary etiquette prescribed in the Handbook for Members.

The members were allowed to stand only while taking oath of induction, when some of them developed stage fright and left without signing the Roll of Members kept at the podium. Sadly missing was the pretty ritual of going up the dais to shake the presiding officer’s hand, circumambulate the chair to emerge from the other side and greet the members of the House with a smile of achievement. Also missing was the fanfare and hurly burly witnessed at the start of a Parliament sitting.

The Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha sittings were held in 9 a.m.-1 p.m. and 3 p.m.-7 p.m. shifts. In order to observe physical distancing norms, the members were made to sit at two ends of each bench, on three locations.

The media personnel covering parliament proceedings unfortunately missed their breaking-news interactions alongside breakfast or high tea with the members, particularly in the Central Hall. They are not allowed to tail politicians to ask uncomfortable questions. Since some of the MPs were seated next to the media gallery, it considerably cramped the habitual press bonhomie.

Dispensing with the extremely popular question hour left the Opposition hugely disappointed. The equally well-liked ‘zero hour’, when the members can speak outside the box, was curtailed by half. Digital communication, on the other hand, got a quantum jump. The printed lists of questions and answers were made available to the members only on the websites. Other parliamentary papers too were circulated through the electronic medium only. Advisory issued to members above the age of 65 to avoid attending the session, however, did not deter some of the veterans.

At least 30 MPs had tested COVID-19 positive before the session commenced. H. Vasanthakumar, Balli Durga Prasad Rao and Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi died of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.

The session was scheduled to be held from September 14 to October 1 for 18 days without a break, but had to be cut short, on account of the pandemic, by eight days and ended on September 23.

The passage of certain Bills in the Rajya Sabha witnessed re-emergence of the old normal when papers were converted into graffiti, mikes were pulled out and the dance of democracy was staged on the Table of the House, leading to suspension of eight Opposition members for a week. An unprecedented and unconstitutional no-confidence motion against the newly elected Deputy Chairman was countered by a privilege motion against the Opposition.

Thanks to the Opposition boycott, the Rajya Sabha passed 15 Bills over two days, September 22 and 23. Taken together, the two Houses of Parliament passed 25 Bills in the course of 10 days; 11 of these Bills related to replacing 11 ordinances with Acts of Parliament. A record of sorts, but not a great

tribute to the Indian legislature. The power of the President of India, the head of the executive, to promulgate ordinances is unique among democracies based on the Westminster model and has been copied from the colonial pre-Independence Government of India Act, 1935.

20,2020/10/04,Shining light in women’s education,"R. Lilavati, a child widow, refused remarriage, fought for an education and became an educationist

Women educators have redefined history worldwide. Be it Anne Sullivan, who taught Helen Keller, or Maria Montessori and Mary Mcleod Bethune, who established new educational methods.

India’s education canvas too bears masterly strokes from path-breaking women who fought for women’s education and cultural uplift. Savitribai Phule (first woman schoolteacher in mid-1800s), Durgabai Deshmukh (established vocational training schools for women) and Begum Zafar Ali (first woman matriculate of Kashmir) are examples.

Our personal experience unravels the story of one such unspoken hero, R. Lilavati. A child widow, she refused remarriage and fought for an education, becoming an educationist for 35 years during the British Raj, creating an army of Indian educators and finally serving as the Deputy Director of School Education, Tamil Nadu, in 1974.

Leela, as she was known, was born in Madras in 1919. In 1930, this timid 11-year-old was married before knowing what marriage meant. Three months later, before she formally lived with her husband, he died. As her father consoled her, Leela said, “Send me to school”, with unassuming calm. Those four words changed the arc of multiple generations of families. Perhaps, she drew inspiration from R.S. Subbulakshmi, a child widow who founded Sarada Vidyalaya in the 1920s to educate young widows, where Leela would later start her teaching career.

Change-maker

For Leela, this was just the beginning. After schooling in Madurai, she had her vision to be a change-maker within and beyond the classroom underpinned by her teachers at Queen Mary’s College from 1935 to 1939, and Lady Willingdon Training College in 1940 in Chennai. Leela instilled similar experiences and discipline in her students. Students recall headmistress Leela leading Government Girls’ High Schools in Vellore and Chidambaram from 1944 to 1959, dressed in crisp white saris and hair tied in a firm bun, while she transformed a dilapidated wedding hall into a school fit for young girls. Going door-to-door, she would debate with parents to let their children become a graduate before becoming a wife. One of her students reminisces, “India had just gained Independence. Schools had a tall order to shape a new generation of Indians, and teachers were considered role models. Leela taught us self-empowerment and leadership, much before it was described in management books. Several of us became educators, inspired by her.”

Positive thinking and a feisty spirit accompanied Leela as a single working woman from the 1940s to 1970s.

She proudly became the only woman in Tamil Nadu selected for the Madras English Literature Teaching (MELT) Campaign in the 1950s. In 1965, the British Council gave her a rare honour in selecting her to visit England and Wales for a Language Laboratory programme. “We discussed regional challenges in English teaching, which I brought home to strengthen pedagogical techniques at the Regional Institute of English, South India [where she was a lecturer],” she recalled.

When her father insisted on the marriage of her younger sister, Leela whisked her away, boarded an overnight train, and admitted her to Queen Mary’s College.

On her 100th birthday last year, Leela quipped, “Sachin Tendulkar often gets dismissed at 99, but I made a 100!” Leela passed away in Bengaluru in August at 101. Her vision, fearless spirit, and love for literature live as her legacy. What sweet irony then that Leela’s birthday is on March 8, International Women’s Day.

21,2020/10/04,The bird at the window,"A trapped bundle of feathers creates a flutter

“Olive-backed sunbird! Male and female,” I shouted excitedly.

Locked in at home, we have developed an evening walk-in-the-terrace routine. The scene is the same every day: blue-grey skies, green treetops and criss-crossing wires. Yet every evening, the terrace beckons with fresh air and the birds.

I had never known that the green barbet, smaller than a parrot, could muster the energy to make such loud, incessant calls.

Brown specks

But the tiny brown birds, darting across and disappearing into the dense green canopy of a roadside orchid tree, continued to evade my efforts at finding their name. One day, the feeble calls from the bedroom on the first floor connected immediately with the memory of a baby sparrow falling off the nest in the cup of the ceiling fan. Heart thumping with excitement, we tiptoed to a mix of disappointment and delight. One of the elusive little birds from the orchid tree was perched on the window grille, desperately fluttering its wings to get past the glass. I took a few cautious steps, to slide open the windowpane, but as I got nearer, the “chiv, chiv” distress calls grew louder and I retracted.

On the outer side of the windowpane appeared another bird, hitting the glass with its beak. I noticed that the one outside was more colourful and had an iridescent blue chest. “It is the partner,” I said. “But how did he hear her call across the glass?”

I swiftly went ahead and slid the windowpane gently. When a draught of air came in, the trapped bird flew out. I wondered if the birds believed that the timely arrival of one got the other out! But then don’t we also come under similar delusions?

With our perspective limited by the sense organs, it is indeed hard to comprehend the role of a larger hand. But there is no denying that the bird helped herself by calling for help. It got one of her kind to arrive. Most important, the plea was heard by one who had the power to bestow deliverance.

22,2020/10/04,Breaking species barrier,"Strange yet sweet pairings of animals are subject of popular culture

A 130-year-old Aldabra tortoise Mzee and a young hippopotamus, Owen (both in picture), of the Haller Park Animal Sanctuary, Kenya were inseparable for two years until Owen grew larger and became a threat to old Mzee. Such strange yet sweet pairings have been subject of children’s books, movies, documentaries and YouTube videos.

Jennifer S. Holland popularised this subject in her books beginning with Unlikely Friendships.

In many images of interspecies bonding, we can observe a melancholy with the yearning for intimacy. Many of these images are interpreted with a hope of bridging differences and creating bonds.

George Romanes, Darwin’s follower and author of Animal Intelligence (1882), argued that the psychological character of dogs in particular was “moulded by human agency and dogs take on human characteristics”. Romanes claimed that the result of cross-species contact was emotions crossed from human to non-human species.

The impulse of humans is to capture the inner being of other species and ascribe humanly values to it. In many animal portraits, the gaze of these animals is not flattering but one that disturbs the human sense of exceptionalism as proposed by John Berger.

Robotic reproductions of animals don’t pretend to be realistic. Mental commitment robots (MCRs) made in the form of a seal with enormous eyes and blinking eyelashes were extensively used after the tsunami in Japan among retirement communities and used to provide comfort for people with dementia and Alzheimer’s.

And studies showed that non-human and robotic companions do improve the quality of people’s lives.

And it makes us question whether interspecies bonding needs reciprocity.

23,2020/10/04,Foot-tapping chutney,"As Indian indentured labourers and free African slaves built their lives together in the Caribbean, a fusion music emerged

At first, it appeared to be Bollywood, but gradually it moved to a folk form and then incorporated some elements of a Spanish lambada. The beats were fast, the moves were catchy, and the expression was sensuous.

“What is it called,” I asked. “Chutney,” my host answered. “Is it like the chutney in India?” “Yes.”

“Do you know what chutney is,” I asked to be sure. “Yes. It goes with Indian food, especially snacks.”

Part of this form of music came to the Caribbean from northern India, especially Bhojpuri folk tradition. When you reach Trinidad and Tobago, High Commissioner, you will get to enjoy the taste of real chutney dance,” my host chuckled.

I was at the annual cultural celebration of the Trini Diaspora in Ottawa. As he mentioned Bhojpuri, trendy numbers such as Aara hile Chhapra hile, Balia hile la... and Lollypop Lage Lu… of eastern Uttar Pradesh, western Bihar and the Terai region of Nepal crossed my mind. My host, the president of the Trini Diaspora, had invited me to this event after learning that I would be taking over as India’s High Commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago shortly. It was an excellent opportunity for me to learn about the Caribbean culture and the Indo-Caribbean links.

After I arrived in Port of Spain in September 2019, I got several opportunities to listen to chutney music. I gathered that its origin lies in the Bhojpuri-speaking region of India.

As the indentured labourers started migrating to Trinidad and Tobago 175 years ago, they brought with them their music.

I learnt that the style, in the beginning, was that of kirtan and women performed it in their households and places of worship. The primary accompanying instruments were dholak, dhantal and tabla, and some of the themes had shades of the Bhakti movement.

Blend with Calypso

Gradually, as the Indian indentured labourers and the free African slaves built their lives together, the Indian music came in contact with the African form called Calypso that developed in this region in the mid-19th century and laid the foundation of a popular high-tempo crossover music. The language of the lyrics moved from Hindustani to a combination of Hindustani, English and Creole. New African and western instruments such as the guitar, piano, drums and tasha came in fusion with traditional Indian instruments.

Garfield Blackman, popularly known as Lord Shorty, successfully experimented with the fusion and rose to fame with his 1963 hit Clock and Dagger. His classic compositions include Indrani and Shanti Om. Sundar Popo (born as Sundarlal Popo Bahora) added to this repertoire beginning with his 1969 hit Nana and Nani.

Drupatee Ramgoonai, a woman singer of Indian descent, used the name Chatnee Soca in her 1987 album. Her subsequent mega-hit Roll up de Tassa was instrumental in creating a commercial market for this music internationally. Her numbers popular in the Caribbean, North America and the Netherlands are the renditions of Hotter than a Chulha, Wuk up D Ladki and O Tassawalley.

The popularity of Chutney Soca paved the way for it to be part of the Trinidad carnival culture and organisation of annual Chutney Soca Monarch competition since the mid-1990s. Sonny Mann rose to fame for his Lotay La and Roll Bhowjie composition in 1996. Ever since, the popularity of Chutney Soca has enabled the emergence of many other fusion styles such as Chutney rap, Chutney jhumar, Chutney lambada and Chutney parang. Parang is the music of the Caribbean and Latin American fusion. The present trend is the mix of the Indo-Caribbean theme with Indian film music and American popular music.

The annual Chutney Soca Monarch competition has become the most significant Indo-Caribbean concert of its kind in the world. In the past quarter of a century, it has made many Chutney artists famous. For instance, Rikki Jai (who won the title six times), Rooplal Girdharrie (won five times), Heeralal Rampartap, KI Persad, Kenneth Salick (hit number Radica), Raymond Ramnarine (I Ain’t Marriding No More), GI Imran Beharry (Anna Anna), Nishard Mayrhoo and Neval Chatelal (Fyah, Masala), Ravi B. and Omardath Maraj (Ramsingh).

24,2020/10/04,French Open 2020 | Nadal crushes qualifier Korda to reach last eight,"Rafael Nadal is closing in on a record-breaking 13th title at the Roland Garros.

Rafa Nadal blew away American qualifer Sebastian Korda 6-1 6-1 6-2 to romp into the French Open quarterfinals on Sunday and close in on a record-extending 13th title at Roland Garros.

With the sun out and the wind up on Court Philippe Chatrier it always looked like mission impossible for the 213th-ranked Korda and so it proved in a one-sided fourth round match.

Korda, 20, actually had two break points in Nadal’s opening service game that spanned nine minutes and also had game point in the next game in a competitive opening.

He did not win either, however, and once Nadal had sprinted into a 5-0 lead the American already looked forlorn.

Korda, son of 1992 runner-up Petr, was unable to cope with the strong breeze or Nadal's heavy spin as the first two sets went by in little more than an hour.

Even the 34-year-old Nadal can lose focus occasionally though and he dropped serve at the start of the second set to trail 2-0 before rattling through the next six games.

Nadal has dropped only 23 games so far and is yet to face a seed. He will next face either U.S. Open runner-up Alexander Zverev or rising Italian Jannick Sinner in his 42nd Grand Slam the quarter-final, third on the all-time list.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/chfkzh/article32765869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAFAELNADAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/french-open-2020-nadal-crushes-qualifier-korda-to-reach-last-eight/article32765870.ece
25,2020/10/04,French Open 2020 | Iga Swiatek ousts top-seeded Halep,"Swiatek, the only teenager who reached the fourth round, avenged a crushing defeat by Halep at the same stage last year.

Polish teenager Iga Swiatek booted top seed Simona Halep out of the French Open on Sunday with a crushing 6-1, 6-2 victory to make her maiden Grand Slam quarterfinal. Halep came into the fourth round clash on a 17-match unbeaten streak having defeated the 19-year-old Swiatek, ranked 54th in the world, 6-1, 6-0 in 45 minutes at the same stage last year in the claycourt Grand Slam at Roland Garros.

Swiatek avenged that morale-sapping defeat and her victory under the closed roof of Court Philippe Chatrier in 68 minutes was no less impressive against the 2018 French Open champion, ranked No. 2 in the world.

Aggressive

Halep watched in disbelief as Swiatek started with aggression and painted the red clay with winners, often leaving the Romanian rooted to the spot on the court.

Swiatek hit 30 winners as opposed to the 12 managed by Halep, while the Polish player did not face a single breakpoint on her service games. The former Wimbledon junior champion will next meet Italian qualifier Martina Trevisan, who also scripted an upset by defeating fifth-seeded Dutch Kiki Bertens 6-4, 6-4.

After a mastering the opening set, Trevisan went 3-0 up in the second before Bertens stepped up a gear to break back. Trevisan, however, held her nerve and wrapped up victory with an exquisite lob on her third match point on Bertens’s serve.

Podoroska in last eight

Trevisan was then joined in the last eight by Argentine Nadia Podoroska, who beat Czech Barbora Krejcikova 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, making it only the second time since tennis turned professional in 1968 that two qualifiers have progressed to that stage of the competition.

Third seed Elina Svitolina ended the run of local hope Caroline Garcia with a 6-1, 6-3 to move into her third quarterfinal here.

Svitolina, who reached the last eight in 2015 and 2017, put in a solid performance to be the highest-ranked women’s player remaining in the last Slam of the year.

In the men’s section, Rafael Nadal blew away American qualifer Sebastian Korda 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 to romp into the quarterfinals, where the 12-time champion will take on Jannik Sinner.

Korda, son of 1992 runner-up Petr, was unable to cope with the strong breeze or Nadal’s heavy spin as the first two sets went by in little more than an hour.

Setting new marks

Italian teenager Sinner became the first debutant to reach the quarterfinals since Nadal in 2005 when he downed German sixth seed Alexander Zverev 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.

The 19-year-old will also be the youngest male player since Novak Djokovic in 2006 to feature in the last eight at Roland Garros.

Sinner, winner of last year’s NextGen ATP Finals, dropped a set for the first time in the tournament but he never lost his composure. Sinner ended it on a windswept Court Suzanne Lenglen with a booming forehand that Zverev could only return into the net.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/zg73ma/article32765339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWIATEK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/french-open-2020-iga-swiatek-ousts-top-seeded-halep/article32765340.ece
26,2020/10/04,French Open | Djokovic wants line judges replaced by technology,"‘The technology is so advanced right now, there is absolutely no reason why you should keep line umpires on the court’

Novak Djokovic's relationship with line officials has been difficult of late and the Serbian risked their wrath again on Saturday when he suggested they were unnecessary.

The 33-year-old world number one was dramatically defaulted in the U.S. Open fourth round after inadvertently hitting a female line judge in the throat with a loose ball.

Now he believes their job should be done by Hawkeye technology.

“With all my respect for the tradition and the culture we have in this sport, when it comes to people present on the court during a match, including line (judges), I really don't see a reason why every single tournament in this world, in this technological advanced era, would not have what we had during the Cincinnati/New York tournaments,” Djokovic said.

The COVID-19 pandemic meant the majority of courts at the U.S. Open, part from the main show courts, dispensed with line judges as a health precaution.

They are back at the French Open which, because it is on clay, does not use Hawkeye technology for close calls, relying instead on the umpire to examine a mark in the red dust.

While the issue of whether players should be able to challenge via a Hawkeye review at the French Open and other claycourt events, as they do on other surfaces, has been debated all week here, Djokovic appears to want to go further.

“The technology is so advanced right now, there is absolutely no reason why you should keep line umpires on the court. That's my opinion,” he said.

“Of course, I understand technology is expensive, so it's an economic issue and a question mark. But I feel like we are all moving towards that, and sooner or later there is no reason to keep line umpires.

“Yes, ball kids, of course, ball person, yes, but line umpires, I don't see why anymore, to be honest,” he said before adding with a smile “I would also probably then have less chances to do what I did in New York.”

Muguruza differs

Spaniard Garbine Muguruza, the 2016 French Open champion, instead believes traditions should be respected.

“They can also have a HawkEye, you know, in clay court. That solves everything. But I feel it's pretty traditional (now), and I'm a traditional person. I enjoy having, you know, line umpires and chair umpire. And I just like things the old way,” she said.

“You can put a HawkEye (in) and make it more modern, but I appreciate not being a machine on the court. (It would be) even more lonely out there just with us. A speaker that says in or out.”

The ATP's Next Gen tournament has experimented with Hawkeye technology calling the lines using an automated voice rather than having officials on court.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/3k8p0u/article32763957.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DJOKOVIC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/french-open-djokovic-wants-line-judges-replaced-by-technology/article32763958.ece
27,2020/10/04,French Open | Collins knocks out former champion Muguruza to reach last 16,"Collins, who has very little experience on clay, was 3-0 down in the decider but never backed down as she battled through to set up a meeting with Tunisian Ons Jabeur, the first Arab woman to reach the last 16 at Roland Garros

American Danielle Collins threw the kitchen sink at former champion Garbine Muguruza to force her way into the fourth round of the French Open with a 7-5 2-6 6-4 victory on Saturday.

Collins, who has very little experience on clay, was 3-0 down in the decider but never backed down as she battled through to set up a meeting with Tunisian Ons Jabeur, the first Arab woman to reach the last 16 at Roland Garros.

“She (Muguruza) was playing some of her best tennis, coming up with incredible shots and there wasn't much I could do so I rolled with the punches and hung in there,” said the 26-year-old Collins.

“Honestly I don't have a lot of experience playing on clay - I didn't play on clay courts for a couple of years - so it took a while to get acclimatised.”

Muguruza, who lifted the Suzanne Lenglen Cup in 2016, seemed to be in control after losing the opening set, having missed seven of eight break opportunities, but she eventually crumbled under Collins' punches.

The match started on court Suzanne Lenglen but was suspended by rain after one game before being moved under the roof of court Philippe Chatrier.

Collins, playing in the third round here for the first time, played aggressively from the onset, her winners making up for a string of unforced errors.

Muguruza had eight break points in the first set but converted only one while her opponent, whose best results have come on hard courts, converted two of three.

Spain's 11th seed, however, stayed composed.

She continued to play neatly and seized her opportunities this time, breaking twice to go 5-1 up in the second set.

29,2020/10/04,"Closure of gyms has hit over 30,000 families in Pune: BJP MLA Shirole","Legislator questions State govt.’s vacillation on reopening fitness establishments

With restaurants, hotels and bars across Maharashtra set to reopen on Monday with up to 50% occupancy, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Pune, Siddharth Shirole, has questioned why gymnasiums in the State continue to remain shut. On Sunday, he targeted the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s vacillation on re-opening fitness centres.

Mr. Shirole said the livelihoods of more than 30,000 families in Pune alone were severely afflicted by the continued closure of health establishments. The irony of this prolonged closure of gymnasiums, he argued, was in fact proving counter-productive to the health of citizens as the lack of daily exercise was lowering immunity levels.

‘Unfair restrictions’

“It has been more than 200 days since gymnasiums and fitness centers have been shut, while malls, hotels and public transport have been allowed to reopen. Gyms, which comparatively have a lesser density of social gatherings, have been subjected to unfair restrictions,” said the BJP MLA from Shivajinagar, who had written to the Chief Minister last month seeking immediate reopening of gyms.

Mr. Shirole said the shutdown of gyms across Maharashtra had disrupted the regular fitness regimen of health-conscious citizens. He said the restrictions did not make sense as gym owners, operators, trainers and their patrons were the most health-conscious among all citizens and rigorously observed hygiene rules.

“At a time when there is no vaccine against COVID-19 on the horizon, daily workouts can act as natural immune boosters to help combat this contagion. Since there is a clear pattern of the virus acutely afflicting those with comorbidities like obesity, high sugar levels and hypertension, it is essential for the State government to start opening up gyms,” he said, adding that other States had already reopened their health and fitness centres.

With surging liabilities, at least a 100-odd gyms in Pune have been forced to shut down, while many are struggling to keep their heads above water by seeking investment through partnership. Mounting rent charges, electricity bills and bank EMIs have spelt the death knell for many fitness establishments in the city.

Despite numerous protests by gym associations in Pune and elsewhere, along with repeated letters to civic authorities, the government, until now, has turned a deaf ear to them. Job losses in the health industry have been particularly high in bustling metros like Pune and Mumbai, with scores of gym trainers forced to quit and seek other employment avenues.

Earlier, the Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule, too, had urged the State government to re-open gyms. Ms. Sule, the MP from Baramati, had urged Chief Minister Thackeray to permit the functioning of gyms in August itself, observing that several gymnasium owners had invested heavily in their health centers.

The same month, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray as well as the BJP Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis had taken up the cudgels on behalf of gymnasium owners, urging the State government to reopen gyms by following norms laid down by the Union Health Ministry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6npgi5/article32767541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMRESTAURANTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/closure-of-gyms-has-hit-over-30000-families-in-pune-bjp-mla-shirole/article32767544.ece
30,2020/10/04,"MVA allies target BJP over Sushant, Hathras cases","Congress to hold Statewide protest today

The tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance has trained its guns at the Maharashtra unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a day after the medical board of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) ruled out murder in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.

The three parties in the alliance demanded the BJP to tender an apology to the Mumbai Police for casting aspersions on its investigation into the actor’s death case. Leading the attack, State Ministers from the Nationalist Congress Party ran the hashtag #MahaPoliceMyPride on Twitter on Sunday, highlighting that the AIIMS board had submitted its conclusive report to the CBI that there are no injuries on the actor’s body indicating a struggle or scuffle.

The NCP ministers asked the BJP to apologise to the Mumbai Police for raising suspicions over its capability to find the truth in the case and accusing it of having ulterior motives. “There were unsuccessful efforts to malign the image of Maharashtra police by vested political interests. I’m confident that neither the wise people of Maharashtra will let them succeed in their intentions nor forgive them for their deeds,” tweeted NCP MLA Rohit Pawar.

The Congress criticised the BJP over its MLA Ram Kadam’s letter alleging that the Mumbai Police had concealed the drug angle in the probe. “This letter is BJP’s attempt to save its face. The drug investigation has nothing to do with Rajput’s death. On the contrary, there are connections with the BJP which have emerged in the drug case and those need to be probed,” said State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant. The party has already demanded a Special Investigation Team to probe the alleged plan to defame the Mumbai Police using the actor’s death case.

The MVA allies also targeted the BJP over the Hathras gang rape case. State Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said the party will hold a State-wide satyagraha on Monday to demand justice from the ‘egoistic and insensitive BJP government in Uttar Pradesh’. He said, “The arrogant and dictatorial Yogi Adityanath has dismantled democracy in U.P. He has no moral right to continue as CM.”

32,2020/10/04,"‘Ram temple foundation laid, but it’s jungle raj in U.P.’","Recent incidents of atrocities against women have failed to move State, Central governments: Sena

The Shiv Sena on Saturday hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government over the Hathras gang rape incident, saying that “jungle raj” prevails in Uttar Pradesh even as the foundation stone for a Ram temple has been laid in the State at Ayodhya.

The Sena, which is part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, alleged that the recent incidents of atrocities against women in U.P. have failed to move the government in that State as well as the Centre.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. But there is no ‘Ram rajya’ (ideal governance) in Uttar Pradesh. ‘Jungle raj’ prevails in U.P. in terms of the law and order situation,” the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana.

“Atrocities against women continue to happen and the incidents of rape and murder of young women are on the rise in that State,” it said.

“A 19-year-old woman in Hathras was raped and murdered, which triggered an outrage across the country. In her dying declaration, the victim said that she had been raped. But the U.P. government now says that she was not raped. Soon after, an incident of gang rape also took place in U.P.’s Balrampur,” the editorial added.

“But despite all this, neither the rulers in Delhi nor the Yogi Adityanath government were moved. The government itself says that when there was no rape, why is the Opposition crying hoarse. But if the woman was not raped, why did the police cremate her in the dead of the night?” it asked.

“Earlier, when the U.P. government led by Akhilesh Yadav withdrew Yogi Adityanath’s security cover, the latter had cried in Parliament. Now he himself is the Chief Minister, but women in his State are not safe,” the party said.

The U.P. Police also stopped Congress leader Rahul Gandhi from visiting the grieving family in Hathras, it said. “Gandhi was caught by the collar and pushed to the ground. Humiliating a leader of a prominent political party in such a manner is a gang rape of democracy,” it said.

“The body of the Hathras victim was burnt by the police by pouring petrol on it. In which Hindu tradition does this inhuman act fit?” the editorial asked. “When two sadhus were lynched in Palghar [in Maharashtra in April this year], we saw the statements of Yogi Adityanath and the BJP blew the conch of Hindutva. But why is it silent now?” the Uddhav Thackeray-led party asked.

‘Lifeless and helpless’

The editorial said that BJP spokespersons went to town on TV channel debates in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. “But the same people are now saying that the Hathras victim was not gang raped. The victim’s dying declaration has no value!” it said. The Sena said the country has never been so “lifeless and helpless”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vzif1z/article32764571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3BMSHIVSENAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ram-temple-foundation-laid-but-its-jungle-raj-in-up/article32764572.ece

35,2020/10/04,Google is creating a sign-language detection tech for video conferencing,"This real-time sign language detection model can identify when someone is showing signs, and when they are done, Google said.

Google is working on a sign language detection technology to let voice deprived users communicate in video conferencing.

This real-time sign language detection model can identify when someone is showing signs, and when they are done, Google said.

The model can connect to various video conferencing applications, and can set the user as the “speaker” when they show signs.

Researchers at Google first ran the video on a model called PoseNet to estimate body poses. This model is said to break an entire HD image into small frames that can capture positions of the user’s body, like the eyes, nose, shoulders, and hands.

The system then sends this visual data to a model trained on videos of people using German Sign Language.

The model correctly predicted 8 times out of 10 when a person used sign language. With some additional optimising, the model can improve to about 91% accuracy.

The system passes an ultrasonic audio tone to determine that a user is showing signs as video conferencing applications usually detect audio “volume” as talking rather than just detect speech, fooling the application into thinking that the user is speaking.

Researchers conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to communicate via sign language during a videoconference. They received a positive response that the system could detect sign language and treat it as audible speech.

Most video conference applications do not have a mechanism to detect sign language. The new model can help signers to communicate easily and effectively.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/6ma1mt/article32765674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/signlanguage1566298303jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-is-creating-a-sign-language-detection-tech-for-video-conferencing/article32765647.ece

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

A study by Ohio State University showed that when users have the option to click a 'like' button on media articles online, they actually spend less time reading the text.

Researchers found that people spent about 7% less time reading articles on controversial topics when they could upvote or downvote them, than when there was no interactive element. This was published as a study titled 'Computers in Human Behavior’.

The trend was strongest when an article agreed with the reader’s point of view, especially on controversial topics like gun control and abortion.

When people are voting, they're expressing themselves. They are then focused more on their own thoughts and less on the content of the article, a researcher stated.

The study involved 235 college students. Before the study, the researchers measured their views on four controversial topics used in the experiment: abortion, welfare benefits, gun control and affirmative action.

Participants were then shown four versions of an online news website created for the study on each of the controversial topics. Some articles had the up and down arrow buttons, while others did not.

38,2020/10/04,The Real Facebook Oversight Board’ launches. Why an external team is building it?,"The group includes Facebook’s former head of election security, and early investor at the social network, and leaders of #StopHateForProfit campaign.

A group of academicians, researchers, and civil right leaders launched on Wednesday ‘The Real Facebook Oversight Board’ to discuss Facebook’s role in the upcoming U.S. election.

The group includes Facebook’s former head of election security, and early investor at the social network, and leaders of #StopHateForProfirt campaign.

What happened to Facebook’s oversight board?

To address issues related to deciding whether a post has to be taken down or not, Facebook proposed to set up an Oversight Board that will rule on content moderation appeals.

Facebook launched the board last November, and named its members in May 2020. The company is said to have invested $130 million to set up the board.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg had said in November that such a board would reduce the pressure of decision-making within Facebook, and promote accountability.

The board is said to take up to three months to make a decision, and will issue judgements only related to removed content.

People whose posts have been removed in error can appeal to the board, and it will decide whether to uphold the original decision or reverse it.

But this board is yet to start hearing appeals. That means, it is unlikely to hear any appeals related to this year’s U.S. Presidential election on November 3.

Enter, the ‘Real Facebook Oversight Board’

Critics argue that an oversight board is needed around this time of election as a lot of misinformation and propaganda find their way into social media via political campaigns.

Due to this delay, a group of critics are forming a board to assess content moderation practices at Facebook during election.

This 25-member external board includes Shoshana Zuboff, author of Surveillance Capitalism; Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP; Yael Eisenstat, former head of election integrity at Facebook; and Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League.

“The Real Facebook Oversight Board has been formed as an emergency response to address the immediate risk to U.S. democracy,” the ‘Real’ board said on Citizen’s page, a non-profit that holds big tech accountable.

“Academics and experts have joined forces with civil rights leaders to form a ‘Brains Trust’ to respond to the critical threats posed by Facebook’s unchecked power.”

It added that the board will continue to demand Zuckerberg take responsibility for Facebook’s actions. And members will issue clear, achievable demands, and ask Facebook to implement them. They will hold live streaming debates, expert interviews and victim testimonials.

The ‘Real Oversight Board’ mentioned that it respects Facebook’s board, but feared that an after-the-fact review of content with 90 days turnaround will do nothing to prevent the subversion of this election.

No one on the external board is compensated for their work. It is organised by Citizens, and has received a start-up grant from Luminate, a global philanthropic organisation.

What does the activist board demand?

Facebook has repeatedly faced criticism over how it implements its own rules. In June, Facebook was in the news for not taking down a post by U.S. President Donald Trump.

To address such issues, and to hold Facebook accountable, the activist-led board has outlined three demands from Facebook.

It is asking Facebook to include a policy against inciting violence, ban ads that mention presidential election results before the official announcement, and label posts about the election results as untrue and premature before the result.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/fg92c0/article32764706.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/real-oversight-boardpng,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/the-real-facebook-oversight-board-launches-why-an-external-team-is-building-it/article32764702.ece

Mr. Kant said that details of the proposal could not be discussed but added that he expected the policy to be in place within 60 days.

“It will not be appropriate to talk at length at this stage because it is going to the Cabinet but hopefully we should have approval within a month or so. We have already got approval of the expenditure finance committee and [Meity] will drive the proposal. Give us another 60 days,” Mr. Kant said.

Problem solving

40,2020/10/04,The Hindu Explains | How secure are the messages sent on WhatsApp?,"Does end-to-end encryption remove risks?

The story so far: In recent weeks, television news channels have shared leaked WhatsApp chats of film actors in their coverage of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s passing away. This has led to questions about whether communication over platforms such as WhatsApp is secure or not. It prompted Facebook-owned WhatsApp to come out with a statement on its use of end-to-end encryption to secure user messages.

Does WhatsApp have access to chats?

No. Since 2016, WhatsApp has installed an end-to-end encryption system, which, as its FAQ section says, “ensures only you and the person you’re communicating with can read what’s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp”.

Also read | All you need to know about WhatsApp encryption

Governments across the world see end-to-end encryption as a huge issue when it comes to law enforcement. While WhatsApp says it responds to requests from law enforcement agencies “based on applicable law and policy,” it is not clear what kind of data it would have to share. News reports have mentioned that these could be in the nature of metadata such as mobile number, IP address, location, and so on.

How is WhatsApp designed to ensure such secure communication?

WhatsApp uses the encryption protocol developed by Open Whisper Systems, a project known best for its Signal app, which also uses the same open-source framework to ensure privacy. Whistle-blower Edward Snowden’s quote — “I use Signal every day” — is prominently displayed on the application’s homepage. Many closed messaging applications now use the Signal protocol.

What is the technology behind this?

The technology that forms the basis for this is called the ‘Diffie-Hellman key exchange’. In a 1976 paper titled, New Directions in Cryptography, Whitfield Diffie and Martin E. Hellman saw the futility of the old ways of sharing a key securely (say, by “sending the key in advance over some secure channel such as private courier or registered mail”) in the emerging digital world. They proposed a way for secure communication via a method of a shared secret key, and that too when the communication is over a not-so-secure channel.

This is all about high math, but one way to understand the broad concept, used by many experts, is by way of colours. In the world of imagination, a shared secret colour is the shared secret key between two communicators, who we will call A and B. (There are many versions of this example on the Internet.) A and B need to communicate without anyone eavesdropping. They first agree on a public colour (say, yellow). The two communicators then choose their own private colour, which is not to be shared with anyone. Say A chooses red and B, blue. They then individually mix their private colour with the public colour and send the mixture to each other. Note that the eavesdroppers can figure out the public colour and the mixtures. But there is one more step. B’s mixture (some sort of green) at A’s end is added with A’s private colour (red), and A’s mixture (some sort of orange) at B’s end is added with B’s private colour (blue). They both arrive at the same secret colour after the final step. There is now a shared secret colour key.

The message that also needs to be understood is that while it is easy to add colours, it is difficult to figure out the original colours that contributed to a mixture. In the math world, that is called a one-way function. Imagine the difficulty in figuring out a key from complex mathematical computations. The Diffie-Hellman paper said: “A third party eavesdropping on this exchange must find it computationally infeasible to compute the key from the information overheard.”

Can’t those who have access to the server read messages?

End-to-end encryption removes this vulnerability. WhatsApp also says it does not store messages on its servers once they are delivered.

An earlier generation of encryption did not secure the entire channel, but secured the communication between a user and the server (of a messaging service). Once the server received a message intended for another user, it would decrypt and again encrypt it before sending it securely to the receiver. But this meant that there was a chance of security being compromised at the level of the server.

Can leaks still happen?

End-to-end encryption cannot prevent leaks from happening if a third party has access to a device which contains these messages. Encryption also does not help in cases wherein the sender or the receiver of a message shares it with others, a member of a group shares it with others, or messages are stored in a different format on a different application or platform open to others.

Are there other vulnerabilities?

41,2020/10/04,Not all plans are up in the air during the pandemic,"We hear moving stories during the pandemic. And then there are the non-moving ones. If you thought it is the journey that matters not the destination, Singapore Airlines has a non-flight to nowhere. Neither the journey nor the destination matter. ‘Passengers’ come aboard the aircraft (Airbus A 380), have a meal and then go home. This is pandemic creativity.

It is possible that for an additional amount, the airline loses your luggage – just to give you that authentic flying experience. Or you can have that experience by not losing your luggage but fighting with the ground staff all the same.

“Just because I didn’t have any luggage doesn’t mean I can’t lose it,” you say, and a sad, henpecked man with missing teeth sitting behind the counter will tell you, “Sorry, sir, your bags were mistakenly loaded on a later stationary flight, and might have reached Hawaii by now.” It is important to board the right non-moving flight. Especially if you have excess baggage. First class passengers are allowed to board at their convenience, or not board at all if the magazines in the lounge are more interesting. Or maybe I exaggerate.

On Qantas and some other airlines, you can actually fly. But to nowhere in particular. You can buy a ticket for a flight starting in Sydney and landing at the same place. So what, you ask? So this: you don’t get off anywhere in between. Tickets were sold out in ten minutes. Further proof that there is one born every minute. That special flight takes off next week (ticket prices vary from $566 to $2,734). Obviously, as its popularity shows, that is cheap for a seven-hour flight that brings you back where you started.

Airlines have come up with some of the most innovative ideas. If travellers find the flight to nowhere taxing, they can stay at home and order airline meals. There’s even a restaurant that offers only airline meals. That people will pay good money to eat what they often avoid on flights is indication of the extent to which the pandemic has changed our lives. Barf bags come free with every additional meal you order (or if they don’t, they should; authenticity is everything, after all).

Greta Thunberg and her friends may not approve of the Sydney to Sydney non-stop (literally) flight, with tales of carbon footprints and unplanted trees to make the travellers feel guilty. But they can’t take issue with the Singapore to Singapore non-start flight (again, literally) that gives you the travelling experience without your having to actually go through the hassles of travel.

Security checks, I am told, will be conducted only after you leave the aircraft – to ensure you haven’t walked away with the light or bathroom fittings, a food tray or a passing steward. No checks before you enter. But I could be wrong again.

For her next trip, Thunberg will have to take a non-starting ship to counter the effects of the non-starting aircraft on the environment.

42,2020/10/04,"Morning digest: Donald Trump doing 'very well', say White House medical staff; community spread of COVID-19 in West Bengal, says Mamata Banerjee, and more","A select list of stories to read before you start your day.

President Donald Trump said in a video from his hospital room on Saturday that he felt “much better” and hoped to be “back soon,” after a day of contradictory messages from the White House about his condition following his COVID-19 diagnosis.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus during early Friday morning, is doing “very well” as per his physician Sean Conley. The President’s treatment includes a five day course of remdesivir and a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies, an experimental therapy. The doctor’s comments have also raised questions on the timeline of Mr. Trump’s diagnosis.

Expressing concern over the spread of COVID-19, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Saturday the viral infection has reached the stage of community spread.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday recommended a CBI probe into the Hathras case.

Kolkata Knight Riders’ Eoin Morgan (44, 18b, 1x4, 5x6) and Rahul Tripathi (36, 16b, 3x4, 3x6) turned a stiff chase into an exhibition of power-hitting, but their side fell 18 runs short of Delhi Capitals’ 228 in an IPL encounter at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Saturday.

Virat Kohli (72 n.o., 53b, 7x4, 2x6) and Devdutt Padikkal (63, 45b, 6x4, 1x6) guided Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) to a facile eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR), in an IPL encounter at Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

Germany marked the 30th anniversary of its reunification on Saturday, drawing a generally positive picture of the progress made in knitting together east and west. The country’s president declared that today’s is the best Germany there has ever been and proposed a new memorial to the peaceful revolutionaries who helped end communist rule.

South Kashmir’s Pulwama district has witnessed a jump from 2% prevalence of the COVID-19-generated antibodies among the location population to 27.3% in just two months, indicating the trend of “fast-growing prevalence” in the Valley.

43,2020/10/04,Nobel nomination is recognition for Afghan women fighting to be heard: Fawzia Koofi,"Afghanistan’s first woman Deputy Speaker in Parliament Fawzia Koofi talks about being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, negotiating with the Taliban in Doha, and the most recent attack she faced

Fawzia Koofi, Afghanistan politician and negotiator at the peace process underway with the Taliban in Doha, says her nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize, which was disclosed by a Norwegian Peace Council list of frontrunners last week, is recognition for all Afghan women fighting to be included in the reconciliation process, and to have a place at the table.

How do you feel about being shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize, and also for being considered one of the frontrunners?

I think it's a combination for all the efforts that people of Afghanistan have made and the struggles and sacrifices that they have paid during the war, because everyone in Afghanistan is a victim of war. Women in particular have faced injustice, discrimination, lost their loved ones, but also had opportunities taken away from them - opportunities for education and work [during the Taliban regime]. So, they needed to be part of the peace process, they need to make sure that their rights will not be compromised.

And I think this [nomination] is a recognition of all the efforts that women have made to be included in the process and to be heard. And I think it will help a lot in the process by giving such a high recognition to the efforts of the Afghan woman. It gives me personally, much more power, along with my other three sisters [women on the 21-member negotiating team] who are in this process of negotiation.

Do you expect to win?

The fact that we have come up to here is a big achievement for Afghan women. It indicates that the international community and the world is watching the peace process and understands the importance of inclusion of women. Even if I don't win, and I know that they have a tough process of selection, just the fact that we have come up to here [in the Nobel nomination process] is a big success for not only the women but for all of Afghanistan.

Also read: Afghan woman leader makes it to Nobel frontrunner list

How are the talks in Doha going?

What we have to keep in mind is that the war has gone on for four decades in Afghanistan. I understand the expectations back home are high, people want to see the peace process impact their life quickly. But the process has its own challenges as well, we want to really make the foundation of these talks strong. So right now, we are working on the foundation, and the rules of procedure.

Taliban has in the past said that women should not be part of the talks process. How did the Taliban leadership react to your presence there?

Well, at this stage, I do not want to be considered as just a woman. I want to be considered as a representative of my country and as a politician, who has equal rights to sit across the table and discuss the future of her country. Not only the future of women but the future of everyone in that country. I don't expect the Taliban to react negatively to the representative of 55% of their society, if they want to really reconcile and if they want to pursue their political agendas, not through bullets, but through ballots. They have to respect the diversity and understand that we are part of the new Afghanistan.

If the Taliban is to come back into the mainstream, how will the progress made in this “new” Afghanistan, in terms of rights for women and minorities, of democracy be protected?

I know that the people of Afghanistan are worried and women in particular have legitimate concerns [about this]. The kind of situation they have been through during the civil war, but in particularly during the Taliban regime, because the Taliban basically denied all basic human rights for women. If the perception is that we surrender to one ideology, or to the other, I don't think that talks will actually succeed. We are working together, we have differences, huge differences, and these talks aren’t easy.

My understanding is that we hope we will come to a political agreement, not an agreement that will surrender Afghanistan to one or the other idea. So hopefully, we will get something that will accommodate the diversities of Afghanistan today.

Is there a bottom line? Are there things that are non-negotiable, that women cannot be taken out of the workforce, that women will be able to enjoy equal rights?

Women have already suffered a lot. If you look at the social indicators, yes, we have had progress over the past 20 years in terms of women’s education, health, political participation, access to economic resources, nothing to compare to the time when Taliban were in power, but still Afghanistan is a country which has the worst indicators, the highest numbers for maternal mortality, highest illiteracy rates etc. So how much more shall we pay for the sake of peace?

Peace, with integrity and with dignity and inclusivity is the only way to bring stability. We also have Hindus and Sikhs in our country, we have sectarian minorities, so no peace will be long lasting if everyone in Afghanistan does not feel that they are being heard.

Tell us about the most recent attack you faced?

About a month and a half ago, I was coming from one of the provinces. I had gone to offer condolences to the family of an army officer who lost his life in the battlefield. On the way back, two cars began chasing us and while [militants in] one car stopped my car, those in the other one began shooting from the back. My right hand was fractured, and I still have to go to the hospital here every day to clean the open wound. My daughter was with me during the attack, and I was lucky, if it was three or four centimetres closer to my chest, probably I would have not been alive.

What has it been like to engage with the Taliban, given they were responsible for the violence in Afghanistan, and for the violence that you have suffered personally? What was it like to be at the table with them?

I did go through some emotional moments. I had to go through certain process to accept the fact that we cannot continue to pursue our agendas through violence and more killing and more bloodshed. Every day in Afghanistan, people are losing lives. So yes, we are all victims of war. I have personally gone through so much, not only in terms of losing my family members, my brother, father, my husband, into the war. Even parts of my body, and my right hand [injured in an assassination attempt in August 2020] is not fully operational yet.

It’s also about the opportunities that were taken away from us, from me as woman. I could have been a medical doctor; the other young women of Afghanistan have also lost opportunities. Now the option is, are we going to continue to kill more people to pursue our political agenda, or there is a better way, by being an example of humanity that can rule minds and hearts of people. If Taliban think they will have a victory through bloodshed, they have to really correct themselves.

What are your expectations from India at this point in Afghanistan’s history?

Regardless of what the politics of our governments have been, we have always had a friendly relationship with India. My expectation is that the regional countries will put their efforts forward to support the establishment of a peaceful settlement. I hope that India as one of our great friends will get engaged. I also hope that India continues to support our education system as they have been doing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lgze23/article32767417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FAWZIAKOOFI1KB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nobel-nomination-is-recognition-for-afghan-women-fighting-to-be-heard-fawzia-koofi/article32767418.ece
44,2020/10/04,New Caledonia rejects full independence from France again,"The “no” vote won 53.26% of votes cast votes, a narrower margin of victory than in the 2018 poll.

The South Pacific archipelago of New Caledonia voted against independence from France on Sunday for the second time in as many years, a provisional final count showed.

A surprise “yes” vote would have deprived Paris of a foothold in a region where China is expanding its influence, and dented the pride of a colonial power whose reach once spanned large parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

The “no” vote won 53.26% of votes cast votes, a narrower margin of victory than in the 2018 poll.

The result will bring relief to President Emmanuel Macron's government, whose attention had been focused on the coronavirus pandemic in the run-up to the referendum.

“Voters have had their say. They confirmed their wish to keep New Caledonia a part of France. As head of state, I salute this show of confidence in the Republic with a profound feeling of gratitude,” Mr Macron said in a televised statement.

New Caledonia became a French colony in 1853. Tensions have long run deep between pro-independence indigenous Kanaks and descendants of colonial settlers who remain loyal to Paris.

Sunday's referendum was the second of up to three permitted under the terms of the 1998 Noumea Accord, an agreement enshrined in France's constitution and which set out a 20-year path towards decolonisation.

France stood ready to organise a further vote within two years if that was the wish of New Caledonians, at which point both sides would have to accept the result, Mr Macron said.

“We have two years to look to the future,” the president continued.

The island chain already enjoys a large degree of autonomy but depends heavily on France for matters such as defence and education.

Turnout was high at 85.6% of eligible voters - after a stronger-than-expected independence vote in the 2018 referendum.

New Caledonia lies some 1,200 km (750 miles) east of Australia and 20,000 km (12,500 miles) from Paris.

Under French colonial rule the Kanaks were confined to reserves and excluded from much of the islands economy. The first revolt erupted in 1878, not long after the discovery of large nickel deposits that are today exploited by French miner Eramets subsidiary SLN.

Today, its economy is underpinned by annual French subsidies of some 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) and nickel deposits that are estimated to represent 25% of the world’s total, and tourism.

The territory has, however, largely cut itself off from the outside world to shield itself from the coronavirus. It has registered only 27 cases of COVID-19.

For a third referendum to take place, a third of the local assembly in New Caledonia must vote in favour of one.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4yy2ai/article32767127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CALEDONAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-caledonia-rejects-full-independence-from-france-again/article32767128.ece

The march is the latest in a series of rallies in Belarus since an August 9 election, in which President Alexander Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory. His opponents say it was rigged to hand him a sixth term in power.

More than 1,00,000 people rallied in Minsk, the opposition news channel Nexta said on the messaging app Telegram. Official estimates are usually lower.

The crowd, waving white flags with a red stripe, which have become the symbol of the Opposition, marched to the beat of drums towards detention centres, pictures posted on social media showed. “Let them out,” the crowd chanted outside the Okrestina detention centre, where some protesters and Mr. Lukashenko’s opponents are believed to be held.

47,2020/10/04,"Coronavirus | Donald Trump’s blood oxygen level dropped suddenly, says White House doctor","Dr. Sean Conley says the President was given a dose of the steroid dexamethasone and he could be discharged as early as October 5.

President Donald Trump’s blood oxygen level dropped suddenly twice in recent days, his doctors revealed on October 4 as they continued to evade basic questions about his health during treatment for COVID-19. Still, they said he “continued to improve” and suggested he could be discharged as early as October 5.

Speaking on the steps of the military hospital where Mr. Trump spent a third day, his doctors again sidestepped questions, including the timing of his second dip in oxygen, which they neglected to mention in multiple statements the day before, or whether lung scans showed any damage.

Also read | Trump’s doctor clarifies diagnosis timeline

It was the second straight day of obfuscation from a White House already suffering from a credibility crisis. And it raised serious questions about whether the doctors treating the President can be trusted to share accurate, timely information with the American public.

Pressed about conflicting information he and the White House released on October 3, Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley acknowledged that he had tried to present a rosy description of the President’s condition.

""I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude of the team, that the president, that his course of illness has had. Didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction,” Dr. Conley said. “And in doing so, came off like we’re trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true. The fact of the matter is that he’s doing really well.”

The briefing outside the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre lasted just 10 minutes.

Before walking away, Dr. Conley said the President had a “high fever” and a blood oxygen level below 94% on October 2 and during “another episode” on October 3. He was evasive about the timing (“It was over the course of the day, yeah, yesterday morning,” he said) and when asked whether Mr. Trump’s level had dropped below 90% (“We don’t have any recordings here on that”). But he revealed that Mr. Trump was given a dose of the steroid dexamethasone in response.

Mr. Trump’s blood oxygen level currently stands at 98%, Mr. Trump’s medical team said.

Blood oxygen saturation is a key health marker for COVID-19 patients. A normal reading is between 95 and 100. A drop below 90 is concerning.

The doctors also declined to say what they had found in scans of the President’s lungs.

“There’s some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern,” Dr. Conley said. He declined to outline those “expected findings”. The virus can cause pneumonia and other damage that may be visible in scans before a patient is feeling very sick.

Mr. Trump offered his own assessment of his status the night before in a video from his hospital suite, saying he was beginning to feel better and hoped to “be back soon”. And he was back on social media early morning on October 4, sharing a video of flag-waving supporters, most not wearing masks, gathered outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre.

The changing, and at times contradictory, accounts created a credibility crisis for the White House at a crucial moment, with the President’s health and the nation’s leadership on the line. Moreover, the President’s health represents a national security issue of paramount importance not only to the functions of the U.S. government but also to countries around the world, friendly and otherwise.

Mr. Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, pulled his attack ads off the air during Mr. Trump’s hospitalisation, and on October 4, he dispatched senior aides to deliver a largely friendly message.

“We are sincerely hoping that the president makes a very quick recovery, and we can see him back out on the campaign trail very soon,” Biden adviser Symone Sanders said on CNN’s “State of the Union”.

She added: “This is a glaring reminder that the virus is real.”

On October 3, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters outside the hospital, “We’re still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery.” In an update on October 4 night, Mr. Trump’s chief doctor expressed cautious optimism but added that the president was “not yet out of the woods”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2b02qi/article32766974.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSTRUMP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-donald-trumps-blood-oxygen-level-dropped-suddenly-says-white-house-doctor/article32766975.ece
48,2020/10/04,Afghan woman leader makes it to Nobel frontrunner list,"Fawzia Koofi is a negotiator in Doha talks with the Taliban

Click here to read the full interview

Afghanistan’s first women Deputy Speaker in Parliament and member of the team of negotiators engaging the Taliban in talks in Doha, Fawzia Koofi has been named one of the “favourites” among nominees for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, due to be announced on October 9. Ms. Koofi, who has survived at least two assassination attempts, including one just two months ago before talks began, said the nomination itself was a “recognition” for the peace process, and would “empower” the role of Afghan women at Doha in particular.

“I think this is a recognition of all of the efforts that Afghan women have undergone in order to be included in the [reconciliation] process, to be heard,” Ms. Koofi said, speaking to The Hindu from Doha, where she will participate in the next round of talks beginning Monday. And I think that the [Nobel nomination] gives me personally, much more power, along with my other three sisters (other women negotiators in the team) who are in this process of negotiation because we do have to try harder,” she added.

Women’s rights votary

Ms. Koofi, one of Afghanistan’s most prominent politicians, was first elected to Parliament in 2005 when she was also elected the Deputy Speaker of Parliament. Her bid to stand for President was thwarted after new age rules disqualified her, but she has been a strong votary for women’s rights, piloting a Bill on the eradication of violence against women, and has campaigned for the inclusion of women in the reconciliation process. Ms. Koofi, whose father and brother were killed during the Taliban regime (1996-2001), also lost her husband who was repeatedly jailed by the Taliban, and died of an illness contracted there. She has been targeted by militants a number of times, including in 2010, when she was shot at, and again on August 16 this year, just weeks before the Doha talks began, when gunmen shot at her and her daughter, and a bullet injured her right arm. She attended the talks with her hand in a sling, nevertheless.

“I do not want to be considered as just a woman, I want to be considered as representative of my country and as a politician, who have equal rights to sit across the table and discuss the future of her country. and therefore, if [the Taliban] want to really reconcile and if they want to pursue their political agendas, not through bullets, but through ballots, then they have to respect diversity and accept that we are part of the new Afghanistan.”

The announcement of the winner will be made in Oslo by the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Friday. According to the committee’s rules, the names of nominees are not disclosed for 50 years, and the frontrunner list is not “official”. However, last week, the Norwegian Peace Council, an umbrella NGO of 20 Norwegian Peace organisations in Oslo released its list of five frontrunners for the Nobel Peace Prize, choosing Ms. Koofi as the top favourite, out of a total number of 318 candidates. The list of favourites included media freedom groups Reporters Without Borders & Committee to Protect Journalists, New Zealand PM Jacinda Arden.

“The fact that we have come up to hear in the peace process, and had our voice heard is very important, and whether we win or not, this recognition itself is a big success for women and for all of Afghanistan,” she said.

49,2020/10/04,Maulana Fazlur Rehman to lead Pakistan's anti-govt. front,"It comes a week before the launch of a nationwide protest campaign against PM

Pakistan’s firebrand cleric-cum-politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman has been unanimously appointed as the first president of the Opposition’s newly-formed anti-government alliance Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a media report said on Sunday.

The decision was taken on Saturday during a virtual meeting of the Opposition parties attended by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, BNP chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal among other senior politicians.

According to PDM’s steering committee convener Ahsan Iqbal, deposed Prime Minister Sharif proposed Rehman’s name as the alliance president and it was endorsed by PPP chairman Bilawal and others, the Dawn newspaper reported.

There was an agreement among the leaders that Mr. Rehman should lead the PDM in the first phase as he had already led a demonstration, dubbed as Azadi March, against the present Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government last year.

“Since the Maulana has already done a rehearsal and his party is more disciplined and has the ability to effectively mobilise the masses, therefore, in the first and decisive phase, he is the best choice,” said one of the participants in the meeting.

Most of the participants were of the opinion that in order to maintain continuity, it was necessary that the tenure of key office-bearers, including that of the PDM president, should not exceed four to six months.

‘No link to India’

The Maulana’s nomination to lead the movement came only a week before the formal launch of the anti-government campaign by the opposition parties with PDM’s first public meeting scheduled for October 11 in Quetta.

The opposition parties’ heads in their meeting also passed a resolution. Through it, the PDM leaders condemned the PTI government’s statement linking the alliance to India, stating that such a statement was a proof of the government’s frustration.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vnd1y8/article32766773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-PAKISTANPROTESTMARCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/maulana-to-lead-pak-anti-govt-front/article32766774.ece
50,2020/10/04,"Xi Jinping pitches for closer ties with Bangladesh, seeks BRI push","Both celebrate 45th anniversary of their diplomatic relations

Chinese President Xi Jinping said he stands ready with Bangladesh leaders to better align the two countries’ strategies and jointly promote the construction of his multi-billion dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to take the strategic partnership of the two countries to new heights.

Mr. Xi made the remarks on Sunday in an exchange of congratulatory messages with his Bangladesh counterpart, Mohammad Abdul Hamid, on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of the bilateral diplomatic relationship.

In his message, Mr. Xi hailed the steady and long-term friendship, saying he is ready to work with Mr. Hamid to better align development strategies with Bangladesh, step up cooperation under the framework of the BRI and push forward the China-Bangladesh strategic, cooperative partnership to a new level, official media reported.

With over $26 billion Chinese investments and $38 billion dollars funding commitments, Bangladesh is one of the largest recipients of China’s massive infrastructure project.

China has also offered zero-tariff treatment to 97% of Bangladesh’s exports by adding 5,161 more items to the existing list of 3,095 duty-free products.

The BRI seeks to build rail, maritime and road links from Asia to Europe and Africa in a revival of ancient Silk Road trading routes.

India’s concerns

The BRI has been a major bone of contention between India and China as one portion of the corridor passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Besides Pakistan, where China initiated over $60 billion as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China has stepped up its huge infrastructure investments in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives rising concerns of its growing influence in India’s immediate neighbourhood.

The BRI is President Xi’s top priority initiative, which aims firm up China’s global influence.

‘Debt-diplomacy’

The initiative has, however, attracted allegations, especially from the U.S., of debt-diplomacy after Sri Lanka handed over its Hambantota Port to a state-run Chinese firm in 2017 for a 99 years’ lease in a debt swap amounting to $1.2 billion. Malaysia has also deferred several projects under the BRI, citing cost revaluation.

Mr. Xi, in his message to Mr. Hamid, also said the two countries had worked jointly to fight against COVID-19.

Earlier, China had sent medical team to Bangladesh to share its experience of handling coronavirus, which had emerged first in Wuhan in December last year.

Azerbaijan said on Sunday that Armenian forces had fired rockets at its second city of Ganja, killing one civilian and wounding four, and threatened to retaliate by destroying military targets inside Armenia.

The developments marked a sharp escalation of the war in the South Caucasus that broke out one week ago.

The Hindu Explains | What’s behind the Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes?

Until now, the main fighting has been between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan, but it now threatens to spill over into a direct war with Armenia itself. “Azerbaijan will destroy military targets directly inside Armenia from which shelling of its population centres is taking place,” presidential aide Hikmet Hajiyev said.

He said there were also civilian casualties in another Azeri region, Beylagan, which borders Nagorno-Karabakh.

Armenia denied it had directed fire “of any kind” towards Azerbaijan. The leader of Nagorno-Karabakh said his forces had targeted a military airbase in Ganja but later stopped firing in order to avoid civilian casualties.

The conflict threatens to drag in other regional powers as Azerbaijan is supported by Turkey, while Armenia has a defence pact with Russia. Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said: “The attacks of Armenia targeting the civilians in Ganja...are a new manifestation of Armenia’s unlawful attitude. We condemn these attacks.”

Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev said on Twitter his forces had captured the town of Jabrail and several villages in what, if confirmed, would be a significant advance on the southern edge of Nagorno-Karabakh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/53ovqf/article32766004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARMENIA-AZERBAIJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/azerbaijan-says-armenia-attacks-city-threatens-retaliation/article32765990.ece
52,2020/10/04,Pope Francis makes first trip outside Rome in seven months,"He travelled to the tomb of St. Francis of Assisi to sign his latest encyclical.

Pope Francis travelled outside Rome on Saturday for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic broke out to sign his latest encyclical in the crypt where St. Francis of Assisi is buried.

The encyclical, titled “Fratelli Tutti” (Brothers All), will be released on Sunday. It covers solidarity among people in the post-pandemic world.

The title has prompted criticism, particularly in the English-speaking world, where it was seen as not being inclusive.

In Italian, fratelli means brothers but it is also used to mean brothers and sisters, as is the masculine plural in other romance languages.

The Vatican said the title was taken from the first two words of guidelines, known as “Admonitions”, written by St Francis to his followers in the 13th century and thus could not be changed.

The Pope always uses “brothers and sisters” to open his weekly general audiences on Wednesdays and his Sunday blessing.

Encyclicals are the most authoritative form of papal writing but they are not infallible.

Because it deals with social issues, “Fratelli Tutti” is what is known as a social encyclical, as opposed to those about Church doctrine.

When he was elected in 2013, the Argentine pope took his papal name after the saint to show his closeness to the poor. St. Francis is known as “The Little Poor One” because he renounced his wealthy family to serve the needy.

53,2020/10/04,Coronavirus: Britain's cases rise sharply to record level,"The number of deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test fell to 49 on Saturday from 66 the previous day.

Britain reported 12,872 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, a record daily figure for the country, with the government blaming the jump on a reporting delay and saying the numbers in coming days would include additional cases.

The government's website said a technical issue had delayed publishing a number of new COVID-19 cases.

“This means the total reported over the coming days will include some additional cases from the period between 24 September and 1 October, increasing the number of cases reported,” it said.

At 12,872, the number of daily cases reported almost doubled from the 6,968 reported on Friday, smashing the previous biggest daily toll of 7,143, which was recorded on Tuesday.

Britain is now processing more than 2,00,000 COVID-19 tests a day compared with fewer than 1,00,000 at the start of the pandemic.

But the technical issue could be seized on by critics who say the government has lost control of the virus amid a shortage of testing capacity.

54,2020/10/04,Thousands of Israelis protest against Netanyahu despite lockdown,"Israel has shut down much of its economy and instructed people to stay within a kilometre of their homes whenever possible in an effort to contain a second-wave surge in coronavirus infections.

Thousands of Israelis protested across the country on Saturday, flouting a new law meant to curb anti-government demonstrations during a coronavirus lockdown.

The street protests, just three days after parliament approved an edict to limit the scope of such demonstrations, kept pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his handling of the coronavirus crisis and over allegations of corruption, which he denies.

The new law bans Israelis from holding demonstrations more than 1 km from their homes and forces stricter social distancing, a measure the government said was aimed at curbing COVID-19 infections.

Critics have called it a blow to freedom of speech.

Most protests on Saturday night were small and scattered throughout the country, though a crowd of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv. A small number of protesters scuffled with police and tried to block city streets. About fifteen people were arrested, a police spokesman said.

55,2020/10/04,"Two killed, nine missing as Storm Alex hits parts of France and Italy","Mayor Christian Estrosi called it the worst flooding disaster in the area for more than a century

Two people died and nine people were missing in France and Italy after a storm hit border regions of the two countries, bringing record rainfall in places and causing heavy flooding that swept away roads and damaged homes, authorities said on Saturday.

The storm, dubbed Alex, ravaged several villages around the city of Nice on the French Riviera. Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi called it the worst flooding disaster in the area for more than a century after flying over the worst-hit area by helicopter.

“The roads and about 100 houses were swept away or partially destroyed,” he told French news channel BFM.

“I have been particularly shocked by what I saw today,” French Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference after visiting affected areas, adding he was concerned that the death toll could rise.

At least eight people were missing in France, authorities said. These included two firemen whose vehicle was carried away by a swollen river, according to local witnesses cited by several French media.

Television images from both countries showed several roads and bridges had been swept away by flood water and numerous rivers were reported to have burst their banks.

In Italy, at least two people died — one a fireman hit by a falling tree and another a man in his 30s whose car was swept into a river after a road subsided, local authorities said.

As night fell, one Italian was still unaccounted for while a further 16 people earlier feared missing, including a group of six German trekkers, had all been found safe.

Officials in the Piedmont region reported a record 630 mm of rain in just 24 hours in Sambughetto, close to the border with Switzerland. The Piedmont regional chief Alberto Cirio called on the government to declare a state of emergency.

The water level in the River Po jumped by 3 metres in just 24 hours.

Eric Ciotti, a member of the French parliament who is from one of the worst affected villages in the area, Saint-Martin-Vşsubie, said several villages were cut off as they are located in steep-sided valleys of the mountainous region.

Meteo France said that rainfall of 500 mm of rain was registered over 24 hours in Saint-Martin-Vşsubie and close to 400 mm in several other towns - the equivalent of more than three months of rain at this time of the year.

There was more rainfall than on Oct. 3 2015, when floods caused the death of 20 people in and around the French Riviera city of Cannes, Jşrşmy Crunchant, the director of civil protection, told France Info.

56,2020/10/04,Donald Trump says next days of COVID-19 treatment will be 'real test',"In a four-minute video posted on Twitter, Mr Trump said he felt ‘much better’ and hoped to be ‘back soon’

President Donald Trump said in a video from his hospital room on Saturday that he felt “much better” and hoped to be “back soon,” after a day of contradictory messages from the White House about his condition following his COVID-19 diagnosis.

In a four-minute video posted on Twitter, Mr Trump, looking tired and wearing a jacket and open-necked shirt, said he ”wasn't feeling so well” when he first arrived at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday and that the next few days would be crucial in his fight against the coronavirus.

“Over the next period of a few days, I guess that's the real test, so we'll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days,” Mr Trump said, seated at a round table in front of an American flag.

The address came hours after differing assessments of his health from administration officials left it unclear how ill the president had become since he tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday night, a matter of enormous public concern.

A White House team of doctors said on Saturday morning that Mr Trump's condition was improving and that he was already talking about returning to the White House. One doctor said Mr Trump had told them “'I feel like I could walk out of here today.'”

Within minutes, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows gave reporters a less rosy assessment, telling reporters, “The President's vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. We're still not on a clear path to a full recovery.”

Mr Meadows, whose initial comments were delivered on condition that he not be identified, altered his tone hours later, telling Reuters that Mr Trump was doing “very well” and that “doctors are very pleased with his vital signs.”

Mr Meadows did not clarify the discrepancy in his comments.

Mr Trump was flown from the White House to Walter Reed, near Washington, about 17 hours after he announced his illness. Administration officials, who described the move as precautionary, said he would stay at the hospital for several days.

Another source who was briefed on Mr Trump's condition said the president was given supplemental oxygen before he went to the hospital. The decision to hospitalize Mr Trump came after he had experienced difficulty breathing and his oxygen level dropped, according to a source familiar with the situation.

White House doctor Sean P. Conley told reporters outside the hospital on Saturday that Mr Trump had not experienced difficulty breathing, and was not given oxygen at Walter Reed.

“The team and I are extremely happy with the progress the President has made,” Dr Conley said. He declined to give a timetable for Mr Trump's possible release from the hospital.

Dr. Amesh Adalja, an emerging infectious disease professor at Johns Hopkins University, said, “If a person is hospitalized we don't consider it a mild case anymore.” But he said it was difficult to gauge Mr Trump's medical status based on the information provided publicly so far by his doctors.

“Today's spectacle - doctors saying one thing, White House sources saying another thing, and both later amending their statements - only reinforces the credibility problems of this administration,” said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.

“While I am feeling good and only have mild symptoms, due to my history of asthma we decided this is an important precautionary measure.”

58,2020/10/04,‘Best Germany yet’ marks 30th anniversary of reunification,"Germany was reunited on October 3, 1990, after four decades of Cold War division

Germany marked the 30th anniversary of its reunification on Saturday, drawing a generally positive picture of the progress made in knitting together east and west. The country’s president declared that today’s is the best Germany there has ever been and proposed a new memorial to the peaceful revolutionaries who helped end communist rule.

Germany was reunited on October 3, 1990, after four decades of Cold War division. East Germany joined the western federal republic less than a year after the east’s communist rulers - under pressure from growing protests - opened the Berlin Wall and the rest of the highly fortified border between the two States on Nov. 9, 1989.

While much progress has been made since then, economic and other differences between the west and the less-prosperous east still persist. A long-lasting trend of more people leaving the east than moving there has finally halted in recent years. Pensions in the east are nearing the level of those in the west, though wages are lower.

And Germany’s biggest companies are still headquartered in the west, while political polarization has been most noticeable over recent years in the east, where the far-right Alternative for Germany party is particularly strong.

The coronavirus pandemic meant that celebrations were relatively low-key - as Chancellor Angela Merkel put it this week, “quieter than the occasion would actually deserve. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier led the main ceremony at a hall in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, with 230 guests - about one-fifth of the audience originally planned.

Germany is rightly proud on the anniversary of reunification, “and no pandemic can get in the way of that, Mr Steinmeier said. He summed up mixed feelings about the progress of the past three decades by saying that we are not nearly as far along as we should be, but at the same time we are much further along than we think.

Eastern cities such as Leipzig and Rostock are now economically stronger than parts of the western Ruhr industrial region, Mr Steinmeier said, and there are more and more eastern success stories. Mr Steinmeier contrasted reunification in 1990, preceded by peaceful protests and sealed by international agreement, with the emergence of the unified German state nearly 150 years ago - brutally forced, with iron and blood, after wars with our neighbors, based on Prussian dominance, on militarism and nationalism. He said Saturday’s anniversary is a reminder of the value of an international order which is so strongly contested today, unfortunately in western societies too.

Memorial

“We are living today in the best Germany there has ever been,” the president said. “Let’s thank all those who worked for it.” He advocated creating a memorial to the peaceful revolutionaries of East Germany whose efforts brought the communist dictatorship to an end. That would add to existing memorials at remnants of the Berlin Wall and former facilities run by the Stasi, East Germany’s secret police, and to an already-planned unity memorial in Berlin.

Germany could use a place that reminds us that East Germans took their fate in their own hands and liberated themselves,” Mr Steinmeier said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1nvkm1/article32763486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GERMANY-REUNIFICATION30ANNIVERSARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/best-germany-yet-marks-30th-anniversary-of-reunification/article32763487.ece

60,2020/10/04,U.S. job growth slows as recovery seems to falter,"Number of those permanently unemployed nears 4 million underscoring urgent need for additional fiscal stimulus

U.S. employment growth slowed more than expected in September and more than 3,00,000 Americans lost their jobs permanently, dealing a potential blow to President Donald Trump ahead of the fiercely contested Nov. 3 presidential election.

The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report on Friday underscored an urgent need for additional fiscal stimulus to aid the economy’s recovery from a recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The slowdown in hiring compounds problems for Mr. Trump, who announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus.

Just over half of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recouped. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party nominee, blames the economic turmoil on the White House’s handling of the pandemic, which has killed more than 2,00,000 people and infected more than 7 million.

“The jobs report adds to Trump’s woes,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. “Betting odds signal a diminished chance he will win re-election and a much higher probability of a Democrat clean sweep.”

Non-farm payrolls increased by 6,61,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May, after advancing 1.489 million in August.

Every sector added jobs with the exception of government, which shed 2,16,000 positions because of the departure of temporary workers hired for the Census and lay-offs at State and local government education departments as many school districts shift to online learning.

Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 3,18,000, accounting for nearly half of the gain in non-farm employment. Payrolls are 10.7 million below their pre-pandemic level.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 8,50,000 jobs were created in September. Employment growth peaked in June when payrolls jumped by a record 4.78 million jobs.

Classification error

The unemployment rate fell to 7.9% in September as 6,95,000 people left the labour force from 8.4% in August. The jobless rate was again biased down by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

Without this error, the government estimated that the unemployment rate would have been about 8.3% in September. There were 3.8 million people who had lost their jobs for good, up 3,45,000 from August. More experienced long bouts of unemployment, with the number of people out of work for more than 27 weeks surging 7,81,000 to 2.4 million.

The slowing labour market recovery is the strongest sign yet that the economy has shifted into lower gear heading into the fourth quarter. Growth got a boost over the summer from fiscal stimulus. Third-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates are topping a 32% annualized rate, which would reverse a historic 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter.

Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been cut to about a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace.

“The virus is in the driver’s seat in controlling the speed of the recovery and right now the economy is in the slow lane unless Congress and the White House can settle their differences and provide additional stimulus,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bqrdrv/article32762339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THBUJOBS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-job-growth-slows-as-recovery-seems-to-falter/article32762340.ece
61,2020/10/04,Coronavirus | Donald Trump’s doctor clarifies diagnosis timeline,"‘The President was first diagnosed with COVID-19 on the evening of Thursday, October 1,’ said a memo from Dr. Sean Conley, which the White House forwarded to reporters

After suggesting that U.S. President Donald Trump may have been diagnosed as positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday afternoon, his physician Dr. Sean Conley clarified that the President was first diagnosed as having the virus on the evening of Thursday, October 1.

The confusion over the timeline, caused by Dr. Conley’s contradictory and evasive answers to questions on when Mr Trump last tested negative or first tested positive for the virus, left open the possibility that Mr. Trump had travelled to Bedminster, New Jersey, on Thursday, after the diagnosis.

“This morning while summarizing the President’s health, I incorrectly used the term ‘seventy two hours’ instead of ‘day three’ and ‘forty-eight hours’ instead of ‘day two’ with regards to his diagnosis and the administration of the polyclonal antibody therapy,” said a memo from Dr. Conley, which the White House forwarded to reporters.

“The President was first diagnosed with COVID-19 on the evening of Thursday, October 1st and had received Regeron’s antibody cocktail on Friday, October 2nd,” Dr Conley said.

62,2020/10/04,BJP leaders meet to finalise names in Bihar,"NDA hit with exit of Lok Janshakti Party

The BJP central election committee met here on Sunday to discuss the Bihar Assembly polls and finalise candidates, as the ruling National Democratic Alliance has suffered a setback with Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party deciding to walk out of it.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president J.P. Nadda and other leaders attended the meeting.

Earlier in the day, leaders including Home Minister Amit Shah and Mr. Nadda held long deliberations over the unfolding political situation in the State where the saffron party has declared JD(U) president and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as the leader of the alliance for the three-phase polls.

While lauding the BJP, the LJP said it will not contest the elections under Mr. Kumar’s leadership.

The polls will be held on October 28, November 3 and 7 and the counting will take place on November 10.

63,2020/10/04,Bihar Assembly elections | LJP confirms decision to contest outside NDA,"To take on JD(U); will not field candidates against BJP.

The Lok Janshakti Party at a meeting of its Parliamentary Board has decided to contest on its own in the upcoming Bihar Assembly poll. The decision, however, does not mar its political ties with the BJP with the party saying it will not contest against any BJP candidate and will support the latter in a post-poll scenario.

In an official statement released after the Parliamentary Board meeting chaired by party President Chirag Paswan, the party said that at a national level the party has strong ties with the BJP but at the State level, because of ideological differences with the JD(U), it has decided to go it alone.

The Hindu had reported on October 2 that the LJP would contest outside the alliance to mop up pro-BJP and anti-Nitish Kumar votes. It planned to take on the JD(U) with the slogan BJP se bair nahi, Nitish teri Khair nahi (No enmity with Modi but won’t spare [Bihar Chief Minister and JD (U) President] Nitish Kumar).

The LJP in its official statement also said it will work towards a BJP-LJP government in Bihar. “LJP believes that on the lines of the BJP government in the Centre, the Bihar government should also be led by BJP,” the statement said.

In the seat sharing formula under discussion among the NDA allies, the LJP was being offered only 25 odd seats.

An official announcement of seats and candidates is expected once the BJP sorts out its seat arrangement between the JD(U) and Jiten Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha.

The LJP’s decision is a culmination of many months of a belligerent campaign against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar by party president Chirag Paswan. Mr. Paswan had accused the Bihar CM of taking forward the saat nischey or “seven promises” agenda that was originally part of the RJD-JD(U) government in 2015. Mr Paswan had started work on his party’s own vision document — “Bihar First, Bihari First” — and at Sunday’s meeting all leaders backed this document. The party has decided to base its campaign on this document.

Mr Paswan had also accused Mr. Kumar of not listening to feedback from alliance partners, going to the extent of saying that for over a year he has not spoken to Bihar CM as the latter refused to reply to any of his letters or respond to phone calls. The LJP chief was also severely critical of the Nitish government’s handling of the migrant crisis during the pandemic and slammed him for the crumbling infrastructure of the State after 15 years under him.

The party’s Parliamentary Board meeting was originally scheduled for Saturday evening but had to be postponed as party patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan had to undergo an emergency heart surgery. He has been admitted at a Delhi hospital for nearly a month now. In a tweet, Mr. Chirag Paswan said his father had undergone a heart surgery due to sudden developments on Saturday evening, which forced him to cancel the party meeting.

If needed, the Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution will undergo another operation in a few weeks, he said.

65,2020/10/04,Double the joy,"There’s so much to look out for this month; so keep your eyes peeled skywards.

With shorter days and longer nights, nights, enjoy the nip in the air as you watch the happenings in the sky.

Full moon

October begins and ends with a full moon. October 1 was the Hunter’s Moon, as it was called by Native American tribes. It’s that time of the year when the leaves fall from the trees and the game is fat and ready to be hunted. Other names for it are Travel Moon, Blood Moon and Harvest Moon. The last is the one that occurs closest to the September equinox each year. The October 1 Full Moon would have also appeared tiny because of its distance from Earth in orbit. We also have a ‘blue moon’ or a second full moon this month. This occurs only once every two-three years because of the lunar cycle. By the way, the moon does not turn blue.

Draconids meteor shower

This minor meteor shower, which produces only about 10 meteors per hour, is caused by dust grains left behind by the comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner (first discovered in 1900). It runs annually from October 6-10 and peaks on October 7 this year. The second-quarter moon will ensure dark skies in the early evening for what should be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Draco, but can appear anywhere in the sky.

At its brightest best

On October 13, Mars will be brighter than at any other time this year. The last time this happened was on July 2018. It will also be at its closest to Earth and its face will be fully illuminated by the Sun and will be visible all night long.

66,2020/10/04,Nana replies,"Now that Maya’s grandfather has responded to her Facebook request, does that mean aliens are real?

The story so far: After Rocky’s father tells him that aliens and ghosts are similar, Rocky is eager to see if Nana responds. Rocky knew that if he misbehaved with Maya, Konica would get suspicious.

“Can’t you knock?” he grunted.

“Since when did friends knock?” Maya got an approving nod from Konica.

“Konica di, do you have a Facebook account?”

“Duh!” Konica glared at Maya. “Which teenager doesn’t?”

“Di, can I play Temple Run? Please!”

An unsuspecting Konica handed Maya her mobile. Maya settled down at the far end of the bed and opened Facebook. Her mouth fell open. “A strange thing has happened!” she said. When Konica saw what Maya had done, she snatched back her phone. “Why Facebook, you brat?”

“Konica di, ghosts do Facebook.”

Scepticism abounds

“Nonsense!” snarled Konica.

“Nana accepted my friend request and said ‘hi’ to me,” Maya said, excitedly bouncing on Rocky’s bed. Rocky’s face paled; that meant aliens were real!

“What do you mean, Nana said ‘hi’?” frowned Konica. Maya now desperately wanted to chat with Nana, so she told Konica everything.

“That’s crazy. This must be a joke. Ghosts don’t use Facebook,” said Konica.

“Why not?” asked Maya.

“That’s because ghosts can communicate without Facebook,” replied Konica. “Because they can be wherever they want. Meet whoever they want.”

Rocky and Maya giggled.

“What’s so funny, you imps?” snarled Konica. Rocky told her what Maya had said about them suddenly appearing and scaring people.

Although Konica wasn’t convinced, it sounded plausible. So, she handed Maya her phone.

“Hi Nana, how’s life in heaven?” Maya typed.

Rocky and Konica giggled, but soon, their giggles disappeared.

“Heavenly,” replied Nana. “How did your history test go, Maya?”

“Awesome!” typed Maya.

Konica snatched the phone back. “Are you nuts? It could also be a fake person.”

“But why would a stranger want to know about my history test?” asked Maya. “It’s my Nana.”

“We’ll soon find out,” replied Konica. “Rocky, let’s send a friend request to someone of ours. Our Nana or maybe your Nani!”

Rocky thought it was a terrible idea.

He was already having trouble hiding his test papers from his parents. Now, it would be impossible to do that with his grandparents’ ghosts.

“We could create a whole ghost Facebook community, and become famous,” Maya’s eyes twinkled.

A doctor at Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thiruvananthapuram, and a serial actor were among the three people who were arrested by the Fort police on Saturday for allegedly defaming a woman by circulating morphed images.

The accused were identified as Subu, 43, of Palayamkunnu in Varkala; Jasmeerkhan, 36, of Karakulam; and Sreejith, 30, of Pazhakutty in Nedumangad. While Subu is a doctor at the Dental department of the MCH, Jasmeerkhan used to act in television serials. They were caught by a team led by Fort Assistant Commissioner Prathapan Nair and station house officer Rakesh.

Attempt to islead

They have been arrested for allegedly maligning a woman from Varkala, who is also a relative of Subu. In a bid to create differences between the victim and her husband, the gang morphed her images and sent them to her husband, sister, and relatives on a social networking application.

The case was registered on the basis of a complaint submitted by the victim’s sister who hails from Manacaud. Notably, Subu had accompanied the complainant to the police station to mislead the investigators.

Sreejith, who runs a photocopy shop, allegedly bought a SIM card using the identification documents of a Vattappara native.

The SIM card was then used to circulate the morphed images in a bid to evade detection, the police said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/3-including-mch-doctor-held-for-circulating-morphed-images/article32764579.ece

70,2020/10/04,Weekly shandies come alive again in Tiruchi,"Cattle traders hope the market at Manapparai will also reopen soon

Much to the relief of buyers, the weekly shandies in Tiruchi resumed their activities on Sunday after the State government relaxed lockdown norms.

No weekly shandy was allowed to operate in the State since the imposition of lockdown from the last week of March to check the spread of the virus.

Though authorities opened temporary markets in different parts of the city to facilitate trouble-free supply of vegetables and essential items, the weekly markets were not given permission due to apprehension of spread of virus in the event of large gathering of people in a particular place.

Acting on the demands of traders and consumers, the State government granted permission to reopen the weekly shandies from October 1.

The popular weekly shandy at GoldenRock, functional on Sundays from dawn to dusk, was opened after a gap of six months. However, it received just half of its usual traders and customers as many of them had no knowledge about its reopening. It was only after seeing the shops, local residents of Golden Rock, T.V.S. Tolgate and surrounding areas visited the market and bought vegetables, fruits, groceries and other essential commodities, according to traders.

Meanwhile, permission on resumption of weekly shandies has raised expectations of cattle traders on reopening of the cattle market at Manapparai near here.

The cattle market receives hundreds of traders from different parts of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Puducherry.

The market usually meets on every Tuesday and continues up to noon the next day. It is learnt that officials are yet to take a call on the plea for reopening it.

Demanding the reopening of the cattle market, a section of traders met officials of Manapparai Municipality and presented a petition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/2jc7n/article32766644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY05-SANDHAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/weekly-shandies-come-alive-again/article32766646.ece

United went down to 10 men after Martial was sent off following a clash with Erik Lamela at a corner and then Harry Kane made it 3-1.

Son added his second shortly before the break as United conceded four goals in the first half of a league game for the first time since 1957 — also to Spurs. Serge Aurier made it 5-1 in the 51st before Kane completed the rout from the penalty spot.

The opener: Michail Antonio, second left, scores West Ham’s first against Leicester City.

Earlier, West Ham shattered Leicester’s unbeaten start with a surprise 3-0 win. In Saturday’s late night match, Leeds United fought back to earn a 1-1 draw against Manchester City.

Second-placed Leicester was brought back down to earth as its three-game winning run came to an end at the King Power Stadium.

Goals from Michail Antonio, Pablo Fornals and Jarrod Bowen ruined Leicester’s bid to win its opening four league games for the first time in its history.

Scoring streak

West Ham, which crushed Wolves 4-0 in its previous league game, has won three of its four matches since boss David Moyes tested positive for the coronavirus in September.

At St. Mary’s, Southampton won its second successive league game against lowly West Brom.

Arsenal moved into the top four as two goals in three minutes saw off Sheffield United 2-1.

Fortunate

But the Gunners were fortunate to take all three points at the Emirates as they had an early escape when David Luiz escaped a red card for a pull on Oli Burke.

Papu Gomez extended his scoring streak as Atalanta crushed Cagliari 5-2 for a third consecutive win this season.

Atalanta’s tally is 13 goals in three games played, to sit top of the Serie A table.

74,2020/10/04,"Digital proof of driving licence is now valid, thanks to MP’s initiative","Srikrishnadevarayulu wrote to the Centre seeking the relief in 2019

The next time a policeman waves at you to stop, do not get anxious even if you are not carrying physical copies of your driving licence, registration certificates etc. All you need to have is scanned copies or PDF of the papers.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has recently notified that vehicle drivers would now be able to present digital/electronic copies of their vehicle documents, including driving licence and registration certificate, thanks to a plea by Member of Parliament, Narsaraopet, Lavu Srikrishnadevarayulu.

The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 2019 has brought in several new changes, but also has put in place hefty fines for violators. In 2019, the MP wrote to Union Minister for Road Transport Nitin Gadkari suggesting digitisation of vehicle documents after recognising the plight of students and young vehicle drivers who were regularly stopped and harassed by traffic police. Drivers not carrying physical copies of valid documents had to pay up hefty fines or wait for a family member to fetch the physical copy. This wasted the driver’s time and caused inconvenience to their families.

Now if the electronic versions of the documents presented to the officials are validated, there is no need to produce physical documents.

“I welcome digitisation of driving documents as it will ease compliance for lakhs of drivers. This incident goes to show the power of youth coming together and approaching responsible public representatives to bring about positive developments,” said Mr. Krishnadevarayulu.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/k2hnkg/article32763292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJDOCUMENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/digital-proof-of-driving-licence-is-now-valid-thanks-to-mps-initiative/article32763293.ece

78,2020/10/04,Cases on the rise in Chittoor again,"Officials attribute it to lack of cooperation from public, resumption of passenger traffic

For a brief while, it seemed that the coronavirus spread had slowed down in the district, but the last week’s numbers have renewed fear in the people, crushing their hopes in the bud. As per official figures, the daily average of cases remains at 800 plus, with the tally moving towards the 68,000-mark, while the deaths have crossed the 650-mark as on Saturday.

The urban areas of Tirupati and Chittoor municipal corporations hold the lion’s share of the daily cases, followed by Srikalahasti and Madanapalle municipalities. The rural side of Chittoor district, which had made news for controlling the spread, has registered over 500 cases during the last 24 hours.

The COVID task force personnel attribute the phenomenon to the “lack of cooperation” from people in both urban and rural areas. On a sidenote, the consumption of the sanitizers at the commercial outlets and at the domestic front has also come down drastically, a medical officer in Chittoor said.

Rural areas

The resumption of passenger traffic between Chittoor district and the neighbouring States of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka is also viewed as one of the contributing factors in the recurrence of cases in the border areas. The tri-State Kuppam division, which used to record single digit cases till last month, is now witnessing a rise in cases with increasing movement of public at the border villages.

Madanapalle municipal limits, where the public movement towards Karnataka, particularly towards Bengaluru, Chikmagalur and Kolar has seen a spike, are witnessing close to one hundred cases daily. The villages of Puttur, Nagari, Varadaiahpalem, Nagalapuram and Satyavedu mandals at the eastern side bordering with Tamil Nadu have also been steadily registering double digit figure for a couple of weeks, causing concern to the officials.

High death rate explained

District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) M. Penchalaiah told The Hindu that the incidence of virus cases “are neither coming down, nor going up.” “The high death rate in Chittoor district is mostly due to the fact that, unlike other districts in the State, we also include those cases to the list wherein the persons are brought dead to the hospital. When such a case comes, we first take swab samples to know if they had been infected,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/vvlokn/article32762976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJCHCASES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/cases-on-the-rise-in-chittoor-again/article32762977.ece

84,2020/10/04,AIARLA seeks cancellation of granite mining lease,"‘Survey nos. 4 and 5 were created in forest block’

All India Agricultural and Rural Labourers Association (AIARLA) has urged the Principal Secretary of Mines and Geology to cancel the mining lease issued in Cheemalapadu Reserve Forest of Ravikamatham mandal in Vishakhapatnam district.

AIARLA national secretary P.S. Ajay Kumar, in a letter to the Principal Secretary, alleged that the two survey numbers 4 and 5 were created in Compartment number 800 of Cheemalapadu Reserve Forest block and the then officials of the Forest, Mining and Revenue Departments colluded with the granite mining company Stone Plus and created new revenue survey numbers in the RF.

He pointed out that the then Divisional Forest Officer, Visakhapatnam, had asked the Assistant Director (Mines) of Anakapalle not to issue transit permits to the Stone Plus company, but the AD went ahead and issued permits. The DFO had also reported the matter to Director, Mines and Geology, Amaravati, requesting that the mining lease be cancelled and requested the District Collector to take action to cancel the mining lease and to initiate action against officers who created new revenue survey numbers in the RF.

Mr. Ajay Kumar pointed out that DFO is an IFS officer and first-class magistrate and is a responsible and competent authority to protect the forest. Unfortunately, his request has not been taken seriously and acted upon.

He urged the Principal Secretary to immediately act upon it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/accoe5/article32763174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-VZ-PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/aiarla-seeks-cancellation-of-granite-mining-lease/article32763175.ece

87,2020/10/04,Parents prefer online classes to reopening of schools in Vizag,"‘It is not safe to send children to schools in the present pandemic situation’

Not many students of Classes IX and X are attending schools for clarifying their doubts due to the prevailing COVID-19 situation. In the first week, the schools saw poor attendance in the district. With the government encouraging online mode of classes, parents are reluctant to send their children to schools.

They are favouring online classes as of now. Parents say that schools should not be reopened on November 2 as announced by the State government and the date should be postponed by a month at least.

Parents cite transportation issues, fear of children gathering in groups and the spread of the coronavirus, as some of the reasons.

“The COVID-19 cases have slightly come down in the district, but they have not yet come under control. So it is better to continue with the online classes for two more months. It may not be possible for the children to stay all the time with masks and not forming groups to discuss something,” said N. Ramesh, a parent from the city.

K. Harika, a Class X student from the city, said that she had gone to the school on second and third day and got her doubts clarified. “Transportation is the issue and my parents do not allow me to board RTC buses or auto-rickshaws,” she said. “The classroom was completely sanitised. Physical distancing was maintained with one person allowed to sit in a bench,” she said.

Harika’s mother Sailaja said that the school authorities have not forced them to send her daughter. Some schools have collected opinions from parents whether to hold classes for doubts.

“I gave my nod to send my son studying Class X to school. It needs special attention to get doubts cleared and it is not possible online. We are taking all precautions. However, out of around 200 parents, only 33 are favourable to send their children to school. So the idea of conducting classes for doubts’ clarification is dropped as of now,” said Ravi Kumar, a parent from Seethammadhara.

Meanwhile, several child activists accuse schools of not following safety norms on the campus properly.

“We had conducted random checks in some schools in the city and found that washrooms are not properly maintained. Moreover some schools are forcing students to stay from 10 a.m. to 4.45 p.m. Are the schools unaware that government had given permission only to clarify doubts?,” said Child Rights Protection Forum (CRPF) president Gondu Sitaram.

The Central government in its Unlock 5.0 directives has also left it to the States to reopen schools in a graded manner after October 15, based on the prevailing situation.

A couple of days ago, the State government announced that it is planning to start schools from November 2.

A senior official from the Education Department said that reopening of schools depends on the COVID-19 situation in the State. However, the government would release proper standard operating procedure (SOP) before starting classes, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/fsn0zp/article32763128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-VZ-STUDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/parents-prefer-online-classes-to-reopening-of-schools-in-vizag/article32763129.ece

90,2020/10/04,Congress leader raises question about stamping ink used at airport,"Madhu Goud Yaskhi says it caused allergic reaction on his arm

Former Congress MP and party spokesperson Madhu Goud Yaskhi on Sunday raised questions about the quality of indelible ink used at the Indira Gandhi International airport in Delhi to stamp passengers arriving from abroad, who have to undergo compulsory home quarantine.

The Congress leader complained that he had an allergic reaction to the ink. Mr. Yakshi took to Twitter, posting images of a badly swollen forearm where he had been stamped.

In wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) had started stamping passengers coming from abroad in March. The stamp states “Proud to protect Delhiites. Home quarantined,” and has a date showing when the person was stamped.

“Dear @HardeepSPuri Ji, can you please look into the chemical being used at Delhi airport for stamping on passengers coming from abroad? Yesterday I was stamped at @DelhiAirport and this is how my hands look now,” Mr. Yakshi tweeted, tagging Union Civil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.

The Minister was quick to respond. Mr. Puri tweeted, “Thank you for drawing my attention to this. I have spoken to the CMD Airport Authority of India.”

DIAL also responded, expressing regret and informed Mr. Yaskhi that Delhi State authorities had been informed. “Currently, this batch of ink is being kept aside for testing by the supplier and further desired action. Thank you for highlighting this issue,” DIAL tweeted.

Mr. Yaskhi told The Hindu that he tweeted the photos to highlight the plight of passengers who also faced similar issues. Replying to his tweets, a few others passengers also said that they had a similar reaction.

Mr. Yakshi arrived in Delhi on Saturday from the U.S. and had to catch a connecting flight to Hyderabad. He said his skin started burning and itching soon after he was stamped. It got worse overnight.

“The stamp is more to educate the passenger, it should not be used to brand them like they are thieves or cattle. And it is not the medical personnel who are putting the stamp, but the security staff, who put it in a casual manner,” Mr. Yaskhi said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ui8o8o/article32766896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ejd2Zv8VkAAPIgc,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-leader-raises-question-about-stamping-ink-used-at-airport/article32766897.ece
91,2020/10/04,Editors Guild condemns prevention of media coverage in Hathras,"It also criticises tapping of telephones of journalists

The Editors Guild of India on Sunday condemned the manner in which the media was prevented by the law enforcement agencies of the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh from reporting on developments after the brutal assault on a woman in Hathras, leading to her death.

The Guild said the victim’s body was cremated in a hurry, without the presence of her family members.

“Equally reprehensible is the way the government has tapped the telephones of journalists engaged in covering the Hathras incidents. Worse, the tapped conversation of the journalists has been selectively leaked, leading to a social media calumny against them,” it said.

The Guild, in a statement, said: “Not allowing the media to visit the incident spots and tapping the phone conversation of journalists undermine and obstruct the functioning of the media. The Guild demands that the government create conditions in Hathras that do not obstruct journalists in any way.”

“Hathras is the worst such case in the scale of interference, but the Guild also notes with concern that such attacks against the media are becoming part of a growing trend seen in recent months, in which a few other State governments have also indulged in such harassment of journalists. The Guild condemns these and demands corrective action,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5qb2so/article32766741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EditorsGuild,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/editors-guild-condemns-prevention-of-media-coverage-in-hathras/article32766739.ece
92,2020/10/04,Involuntary narco tests an intrusion into a person’s mental privacy: Supreme Court,"Verdict significant amid reports that U.P. wants to subject Hathras victim’s family members to these tests

Involuntary administration of narco or lie detector tests is an “intrusion” into a person’s “mental privacy,” a Supreme Court judgment of 2010 has held.

The consequences of such tests on “individuals from weaker sections of society who are unaware of their fundamental rights and unable to afford legal advice” can be devastating.

It may involve future abuse, harassment and surveillance, even leakage of the video material to the Press for a “trial by media.” Such tests are an affront to human dignity and liberty, and have long-lasting effects.

“An individual’s decision to make a statement is the product of a private choice and there should be no scope for any other individual to interfere with such autonomy,” the apex court had held.

The judgment is significant amid reports that the Uttar Pradesh government wants to subject the Hathras rape and murder victim’s family members to these tests.

‘Restraint on liberty’

The judgment in Smt. Selvi versus State of Karnataka observed that involuntary administration of these scientific tests was “sufficient to constitute a custodial environment.” It amounted to a “restraint on personal liberty.”

“Law disapproves of involuntary testimony ... It violates the prescribed boundaries of privacy. Forcible interference with a person’s mental processes is not provided for under any statute It most certainly comes into conflict with the ‘right against self-incrimination’,” the over 250-page judgment, authored by then Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan for a three-judge Bench, observed.

Forcing an individual to undergo any of these tests violates the standard of ‘substantive due process’. A threat from authorities or police to employ such techniques creates mental trauma and may prompt a person to make incriminatory statements, the court reasoned.

The judgment dealt with the harm of involuntary administration of narcoanalysis, polygraph examination and the Brain Electrical Activation Profile (BEAP) test. The conflict was between the desirability of efficient investigation and the preservation of individual liberties.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r0z0ca/article32717631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/involuntary-narco-tests-an-intrusion-into-a-persons-mental-privacy-sc/article32766457.ece
93,2020/10/04,Chairman of Chardham committee alleges violations of Supreme Court orders,"A controversial aspect is the proposed width of the two-line highways envisaged

The chairman of a Supreme Court-appointed expert committee has alleged violations of the court orders in the execution of the Chardham road project — a 900-km, ₹12,000-crore enterprise to connect pilgrimage spots in Uttarakhand.

A controversial aspect was the proposed width of the two-line highways envisaged. The SC committee was divided over the width with one set of members saying it only be 5.5-metre-wide and another plumbing for a higher road width. The SC ruled last month that a 5.5-metre width be enforced as it was in conformity with a 2018 recommendation by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) for mountain roads. The MoRTH is also the key coordinator of the Chardham project. Prior to this, the government had sanctioned a road width of 10-12 metres.

“I’m shocked to see that the Intermediate Width design [of 5.5 m] will only be used for stretches where work has not begun and work where hill cutting has been done and where plantation and other mitigation measures have to be undertaken as per the court orders. The same was confirmed to me on the phone by Pariyojana chief engineer, in charge of MoRTH regional office,” Ravi Chopra, Chairman of the High Powered Committee (HPC), said in a letter to the Secretary, MoRTH and the Secretary, Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change. “Further I’m getting reports from concerned people that hill cutting and destruction of forests are on now in full swing.”

The letter — sent as an email and viewed by The Hindu — was written on September 28 but no responses were furnished as of Sunday evening, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Mr. Chopra demanded that the officials explain how these contraventions were ongoing.

The 900-km stretch has been broken up into 53 contracted road projects. About 700 km had already been tendered out this way and work had commenced. “What we are hearing is that the MoRTH has allowed the 700 km-road projects to continue with the old 10-metre width and only in the remaining 200 km roads would the new narrow width apply. This is a clear contravention of the Supreme Court orders which said that the road width must apply in the entire stretch,” Hemant Dhyani, environment activist and HPC member, told The Hindu.

Where hills had already been cut (in the 700-km stretch), space beyond 5.5 metres should be adjusted to make walkways for pilgrims, plantations and safety barriers, he said.

Prior to the SC deciding on the road width, the HPC had seen fractious dissent with two reports — instead of a single one — being prepared. Mr. Chopra had denounced the report sent by the other members, and, in a letter to the Union Environment Ministry Secretary, said he was “pressured and harassed to submit a one-sided view,” by certain committee members. Most of the members of the ‘majority’ group are affiliated to the Uttarakhand government or Central Ministries, whereas three of four members who have signed on the ‘main’ report are independent experts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m3fafx/article32753866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chairman-of-chardham-committee-alleges-violations-of-supreme-court-orders/article32766322.ece
94,2020/10/04,Hathras case | Congress to hold nationwide ‘Satyagrah’ on Monday,"We will ensure justice to the victim and her family, it says

Continuing its campaign against the Yogi Adityanath government for the brutal gangrape and murder of a Dalit girl from Hathras, the Congress will hold ‘Satyagrah’ in district headquarters across the country on Monday.

In a statement, general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal said the incident has shaken the conscience of the nation. “The brazen inhumanity and illegal high-handedness shown by the BJP government of U.P. in denying basic dignity to the victim even in death and afterwards towards the family has left everyone beyond shock,” Mr. Venugopal said.

He slammed the State police for the “casual and cavalier attitude” in taking cognizance of the victims’ complaints and delay in providing her immediate medical attention. “The 19-year-old girl was denied justice and dignity in both life and death. Her body was cremated without the consent of the family in the dead of night.”

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and State incharge Priyanka Gandhi were both stopped at the Delhi-U.P. border on Thursday when they made the first attempt to meet the victim’s family. Both were detained and the party workers who accompanied them were roughed up by the police. The two along with Mr. Venugopal and others were allowed to meet the family on Saturday after another faceoff between the Congress and the police.

“The Congress party has resolved to relentlessly fight against arbitrary and unconstitutional ways of the Yogi government and ensure justice to the victim and her family. In our continued effort to provide justice to the family of Hathras victim, the party has decided to hold ‘Satyagrah’ on Monday,” Mr. Venugopal said.

Mr. Choudhury, who had said in the past that Chakraborty was being “falsely implicated” following her arrest in connection with a drug probe linked to Rajput’s death, claimed on Twitter that she was a victim of a “political conspiracy”.

96,2020/10/04,Evidence of intent enough for conviction: Supreme Court,"Even if accused is not physically involved, holds Bench.

The presence of the mental element or the intention to commit a crime, if cogently established, is sufficient for conviction. It is not necessary to be actively involved in the physical act of assault, the Supreme Court has held in a judgment.

A Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman said the common intention (Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code) consists of several persons acting in unison to achieve a common purpose, though their roles may be different. The role may be active or passive is irrelevant, once common intention is established.

The judgment, authored by Justice Sinha, came on an appeal filed by three persons accused of a double murder in Assam in 2005. They argued that the trial court had acquitted two of their co-accused on the benefit of doubt. They sought parity, saying if the duo were acquitted on the same evidence, they too should be released on the same benefit of doubt. They argued there was no common intention to commit the crime. They were not armed. So, each of the five accused person should be judged on his own individual acts during the commission of the crime.

The court refused to accept the argument. In his judgment, Justice Sinha observed that the foundation for conviction for common intention is vicarious responsibility. That is, the accused is equally responsible for the acts of his co-accused if there had been prior meeting of their minds to commit the crime.

“The presence of the mental element or the intention to commit the act, if cogently established, is sufficient for conviction, without actual participation in the assault. It is, therefore, not necessary that before a person is convicted on the ground of common intention, he must be actively involved in the physical activity of assault,” Justice Sinha reasoned.

Dismissing the appeal, the court said there was enough evidence to show that the appellants had chased one of their victims and brutally assaulted him.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q3vv7/article32491742.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1TH-COURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/evidence-of-intent-enough-for-conviction-sc/article32765481.ece

A recent joint operation against computer software service fraud offences between the U.K. and Indian security forces has led to raids on 10 suspect offices in six cities of India, according to U.K. authorities.

The City of London Police, the U.K.’s national lead force for fraud, revealed this week that it confirmed people in the U.K. had been defrauded by these companies to its counterparts in India, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

They provided vital witness statements, detailing the victim’s dealings with the companies concerned, evidence which is a key requirement to enable the police in India to take action against fraudulent companies.

We welcome this enforcement action on the part of the Central Bureau of Investigation and will support their efforts to bring offenders to justice through the Indian courts, said Alex Rothwell, Temporary Detective Chief Superintendent at the City of London Police.

At the time of the lockdown in India, we saw a sharp decline in reports of computer software service fraud in the U.K., but we know that criminals adapt quickly to continue to try to defraud people. As more people work from home, the need to prevent fraud of this nature has become more urgent, he said.

The companies are alleged to have displayed pop-up messages on victims’ computers warning them about serious technical problems with their device including the presence of malware infection.

Victims were then advised to call a helpline to gain assistance and were charged a premium fee for the fix and on-going support .

On September 17, officers from the CBI conducted raids on 10 premises based on this information across six Indian cities. Some home addresses of people associated with the various companies were also visited.

According to the City of London Police, the CBI investigation into the case remains ongoing.

The latest operation follows previous joint operations, resulting from a partnership between the City of London Police, American tech giant Microsoft and Indian police forces to tackle such online fraud, which the U.K. authorities said has led to action against 37 call centres and resulted in 88 arrests.

98,2020/10/04,"Plea in Supreme Court to declare law test ‘erroneous, faulty, defective’","Petition refers to complaints of “software glitches” and mismatched questions and answers.

A petition was filed in the Supreme Court to declare the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) conducted by the Consortium of National Law Universities as “erroneous, faulty, defective, discriminatory and violative of fundamental rights of the Constitution”.

The petition filed by several students from across the country led by Uttar Pradesh-based Lavanya Bhatt urged the apex court to quash the exam and order it to be re-conducted.

It asked the court to direct the consortium to set up a high-powered committee to examine the numerous complaints about “software glitches” and mismatched questions and answers so that students are not put in a dilemma. The petition said a foolproof mechanism should be built to avoid these problems in the future.

The online CLAT 2020 was conducted on September 28. The complaints about the exam include results displaying answers different from the ones ticked; results displaying or calculating marks for questions which were not even attempted by the candidates; 10 wrong questions followed by erroneous answers, etc.

The petition also complained about the “unreasonable lengthy design of the CLAT examination”.

“Simple word count of the CLAT 2020 question paper reveals that the paper comprised roughly 18,600 words in total. In view of the time limit of two hours or 120 minutes given to the students to solve the question paper, it was apparent, that students were expected to read, process and respond to questions at the unreal speed of 155 words per minute or 2.6 words per second.”

The petition said “some students come from non-English background, therefore, such a ....... focus on English reading and comprehension skill has a disproportionate impact on these students”.

“In 2019, Prof. (Dr.) Faizan Mustafa, who was then the president and is presently holding the office as secretary of the consortium, had categorically advocated for a more language-inclusive approach to CLAT.”

The petition said the consortium released the provisional answers on September 30. Aspirants went on to raise objections against the answer keys and software used for the exam. The plea claimed the consortium had issued a release on October 3 in a “very arrogant way”, saying the large number of objections had come merely because they had made their filing “absolutely free” while others charge “₹1,000 per objection”.

More than 75,000 candidates applied for CLAT while 68,833 downloaded the admit cards. More than 86% took the exam across 300 centres, the petition said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6carul/article32765363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/plea-in-sc-to-declare-law-test-erroneous-faulty-defective/article32765364.ece

Seeking to make the procedure to opt for postal ballot more convenient for those above 80 years of age and people with disabilities, the Election Commission (EC) has come out with a set of new instructions.

The form required to opt for the postal ballot would be delivered at the residence of all those above 80 years of age and people with disabilities by the booth level officer under his polling station.

It would be up to these two category of voters to opt for postal ballot

“If he/she opts for postal ballot, then the booth level officer will collect the filled-in form 12-D from the house of the elector within five days of the notification and deposit it with the returning officer forthwith,” according to the October 3 letter sent by EC to all state chief electoral officers.

These instructions have been issued based on the feedback the poll panel received from civil society and media during its visit to poll-bound Bihar last week.

The EC said the fresh instructions would be applicable to all elections and by-elections, including the bypolls announced last week to 56 assembly and one Lok Sabha seat.

Bihar is going for a three-phase assembly poll beginning October 28.

As per the instructions, the returning officer would deploy polling teams, who will deliver and collect the postal ballot on pre-informed dates and thereafter deposit it with the RO.

100,2020/10/04,"Coronavirus | One in five Indians may be vaccinated by July 2021, says Harsh Vardhan","States asked to prepare priority list of beneficiaries, says Health Minister

The government on Sunday indicated that about 25 crore individuals are likely to be inoculated with a double-dose the COVID-19 vaccine by next July.

States have been asked to prepare a list by the month end of “priority population groups” to get the vaccine. These would include frontline health workers — both government as well as private sector doctors, nurses, paramedics, sanitary staff, ASHA workers, surveillance officers and others involved in the tracing, testing and treatment of patients.

Coronavirus | COVID vaccine likely in early 2021, says Harsh Vardhan

“The Centre is working on plans for building capacities in human resources, training, supervision etc. on a massive scale and roughly estimates to receive and utilise 400-500 million doses covering approximately 20-25 crore people by July 2021,” said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, adding “All this is under various stages of finalisation.”

Dr Vardhan was speaking at his weekly social media interaction, Sunday Samvad.

Coronavirus | Vaccine strategy ready, says Harsh Vardhan

States were also asked to submit details of cold chain facilities and related infrastructure required down to the block level, the Minister said.

There are three prominent vaccine candidates being tested in India, only one of which, Covishield, had reached phase-3 trials. Covishield, developed by Oxford University and pharma major AstraZeneca, is being tested in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune. SII has committed to producing 200 million doses for India and other low and middle income countries were the vaccine to be proven successful and cleared by regulators.

Coronavirus | India could get COVID-19 vaccine by year-end, says Harsh Vardhan

Though not confirmed, at least 50 million doses of these so far are likely to be available for India at about ₹250 per vaccination.

The other two candidates being tested by Zydus Cadilla and Bharat Biotech are in phase-2 trials.

Normally vaccines take years to be tested and released but governments and regulators worldwide have allowed accelerated procedures to expedite vaccine availability.

Coronavirus | Four COVID-19 vaccine candidates may enter clinical trial phase in 3-5 months, says Harsh Vardhan

Dr. Vardhan has earlier said on multiple occasions that a vaccine is likely to be ready by “early next year.”

The government was also keeping an eye on immunity data with regard to COVID-19 disease while finalising plans on vaccine distribution. A committee led by NITI Aayog member V.K. Paul was drawing up the entire process. Vaccine procurement was being done centrally and each consignment would be tracked real time until delivery to ensure it reached those who needed it most, the Minister said.

“Even if we have multiple vaccines available, they will all be safe and will elicit the requisite immune response against novel coronavirus,” he added.

“People tire out when they have to constantly take precautions. Some of them also give up taking precautions for various reasons. My message to everyone is that we must all diligently take precautions,” Dr Vardhan said.

India now had the capacity to conduct 1.5 million tests a day with a million tests, on average, conducted during the weekend.

101,2020/10/04,"Hathras case | No signs of intercourse, says forensic report","It also said no sperm samples had been found; lack of evidence of intercourse does not rule out rape, say doctors.

In its final report on the Hathras victim, the Department of Forensic Medicine of the Aligarh Muslim University’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JNMCH) has said there were no signs suggestive of vaginal/ anal intercourse. It, however, said there was evidence of physical assault (injuries over the neck and the back).

The forensic report prepared on Saturday and signed by Dr Sadiya Saeed, Chairman of the Department of Forensic Medicine and assistant professor Faiz Ahmad, said it was in reference to the FSL report number 4807-Bio-2020, conducted at the government lab in Agra. The FSL report had stated that the investigation didn't find any sperm in the samples. It was on the basis of the FSL report that ADG Prashant Kumar made a statement denying rape in the case on October 1.

Hamza Malik, president of AMU’s Resident Doctors’ Association said the final opinion was based on the FSL report and denies intercourse, not rape.

Examination delayed

“The forensic examination was conducted on September 22, eight days after the incident. In cases of rape, according to government guidelines, the forensic samples should be collected within 72 hours of the incident. Sperms can’t survive after more than 90 hours,” he said.

He said if the observations in medico-legal case (MLC) report are read with certain findings in the autopsy report in the light of the new anti-rape law passed after the Nirbhaya’s case, the picture would be different. “Besides, how could you discount her statement before the magistrate which would be treated as the dying declaration of the victim and is crucial in such cases. In sensitive cases, nobody should reach a conclusion on half-truths.”

The referral slip of the Hathras hospital prepared on September 14 said as the girl was in a serious condition, so, no MLC was done before referring her to the JNMCH.

The victim was allegedly brutally assaulted on September 14 by four upper-caste men when she went to collect fodder with her mother in the field. After a long struggle in JNMCH, she was moved to the Safdarjung Hospital where she passed away on September 29. The family had initially named only one accused, Sandeep, who was arrested under Section 307 and relevant sections of the SC/ST Act on September 19.

The charges of gangrape were added on September 22 when the girl recorded her statement under Section 164 of Crpc.

Initial findings

The report counters the MLC report prepared at the JNMCH on September 22 which noted “complete penetration” and “loss of consciousness at the time of the incident” got leaked. In the opinion column of the MLC, the doctor noted, “on the basis of the local examination, I am of the opinion that there are signs of use of force, however, opinion regarding penetrative intercourse is reserved pending availability of FSL reports.”

Sources in the Aligarh hospital said as the girl was unconscious because of a fracture in C6 vertebrae, nobody thought of the physical examination of the victim’s private parts. “We do it when either the police or the family members complain of sexual assault. In this case, maybe because of social pressures, the family members didn’t say anything to this effect where she was admitted,” the source said. He further claimed that the JNMCH had referred her to the AIIMS but somehow the police ended up taking her to the Safdarjung hospital.

While the Hathras administration claims that the victim’s family had been changing statements and that the mother and the brother only complained of assault on September 14, family members said the mother had remained silent to protect the honour of the girl.

Meanwhile, members of the SIT set up by the U.P, government visited AMU on Sunday and met the team of doctors who treated the girl during her stay in the hospital. “It is a sensitive medico-legal case and we are cooperating with the investigative agencies. The reports have not been leaked from our end,” said Shafey Kidwai, a university spokesperson.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ptx45h/article32764937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI03-10-2020000276B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hathras-case-forensic-report-confirms-physical-assault-on-victim/article32764938.ece

103,2020/10/04,AG refuses consent for contempt against Digvijaya Singh,"The plea by advocate Sumant Sudan referred to two tweets by Mr. Singh.

Attorney General K.K. Venugopal has declined a plea to give consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings in the Supreme Court against Member of Parliament and senior Congress party leader, Digvijaya Singh, for his tweets.

The plea by advocate Sumant Sudan referred to two tweets by Mr. Singh questioning whether the Supreme Court would declare the alleged sweeping powers of raid and arrest without warrant given by the Uttar Pradesh government to the Special Security Force as unconstitutional or favour it under pressure.

Mr. Venugopal said he was replying on the assumption that Mr. Singh actually did make the statements.

Having said that in his letter, the top law officer opined the statements were “wholly uncalled for”.

But he concluded that the tweets did not amount to contempt of court.

“However, I do not believe that they merit action for criminal contempt of the Supreme Court of India,” Mr. Venugopal said in his short letter dated September 30.

The Attorney General’s prior consent is required under the Contempt of Courts Act to initiate proceedings.

In mid-September, Mr. Venugopal had declined permission to initiate contempt action against senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai for his tweets. In a one-page letter addressed to complainant, advocate Omprakash Parihar, Mr. Venugopal had reasoned that “trifling remarks and mere passing criticism, though perhaps distasteful, are unlikely to tarnish the image of the institution”.

In August, Mr. Venugopal had similarly declined permission to a complainant who wanted to initiate contempt proceedings against actor Swara Bhasker for “scandalising” the Supreme Court with her tweets on the court's verdict in the Ramjanmabhoomi title dispute case.

The Attorney General had found no substance in that plea against Ms. Bhasker, saying her comments regarding the Ramjanmabhumi verdict “appears to be a factual one” and contained her “perception” of the judgment.

The apex court had however found civil rights lawyer Prashant Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for “scandalising the court” with his tweets commenting on a picture of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde on a heavy bike and the court's functioning in the past six years.

104,2020/10/04,Javadekar takes ‘middlemen’ jibe at parties opposing farm laws,"“Sometimes I feel the opposition parties have become middlemen for middlemen.”

Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday alleged that parties opposing the newly enacted farm laws were acting as “middlemen for middlemen”.

Talking to reporters on the second day of his visit to Goa as part of the ruling BJP’s initiative to create awareness about the farm laws, Mr. Javadekar said the actual situation is that farmers earn less for their produce and customers have to buy it at higher rates.

“The middlemen hike the prices and the farm laws deal with this problem by eradicating these middlemen,” he said.

“Sometimes I feel the opposition parties have become middlemen for middlemen,” he alleged.

Claiming that the agitation against farm laws will die out on its own, the minister said, “Falsehood has limited life while truth lives forever.”

“The Congress and NCP launched their campaign to protest against the farm bills. I am going to ask them to look at their manifesto. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh has spoken about such (agricultural) reforms in his speeches. But, the Congress has now done a u-turn,” he said.

He alleged that the opposition parties were spreading a “myth” that APMCs (agriculture produce market committees) will be shut down under the new laws, and government will stop purchasing the produce or the minimum support price (MSP) would be stopped.

“All these are lies,” Mr. Javadekar said.

The BJP leader also said the conduct of opposition leaders in the Rajya Sabha over the passage of these bills was “condemnable and shameful”.

Referring to a protest by a group of people on his way to Mapusa town on Saturday, Mr. Javadekar said he doubts that those who were protesting were real farmers.

He said 60% population of the country is involved in the farming sector, but their contribution to the GDP (gross domestic product) is 15%.

There is a need to increase the productivity and also give them markets outside the country so that their standard of living improves, he said.

Mr. Javadekar said when he was in school, the country’s population was 30 crore, which has now increase to 138 crore, but despite that, theres no shortage of food.

“We are thankful to farmers who have been feeding our country,” he said, adding that it is the responsibility of the government to increase their income.

The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 became law after getting the presidential assent recently.

Mr. Javadekar refused to comment on the issue of diversion of the Mahadayi river water, considered as the lifeline of Goa, by neighbouring Karnataka.

Goa and Karnataka are locked in a dispute over sharing of the Mahadayi river water.

Goa has been strongly opposing the Kalasa Banduri project proposed to be built by Karnataka on the river, which is aimed at providing drinking water to three north Karnataka districts by diverting the Mahadayi water into the Malaprabha river.

Asked about the Centre’s silence over the issue, Mr. Javadekar said, “The matter is before court and I will not comment in it. There is nothing which is pending with us because nothing comes to us. CM will answer questions on it.”

The Supreme Court in an interim order in February this year allowed the plea of the Karnataka government for implementation of the final award by a tribunal for sharing of water between Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra from the Mahadayi river.

It also said the interim order is subject to the final outcome of the petitions filed by the three states against the tribunal’s award.

The Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal passed an order in 2018, allocating 13.42 TMC water (including 3.9 TMC for diversion into the depleted Malaprabha river basin) from the Mahadayi river basin to Karnataka.

106,2020/10/04,The Hindu Explains | How does the removal of offset clause requirement affect Rafale-like deals?,"What does the new Defence Acquisition Procedure say? How does the policy work and what will be its impact?

The story so far: On September 28, the new Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP 2020) was released. Among other things, the Defence Ministry has removed the offset clause requirement in inter-governmental agreements (IGA) and has introduced a new category for leasing of military equipment.

What purpose does an offset clause serve?

A defence offset policy was promulgated under the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP-2005), with the objective that it would bring high-end technology to the country and help build the domestic defence industry. Under the offset clause, a foreign company that wins a defence deal is supposed to invest a part of the contract value in the country, thus developing skills and bringing in technology, while also generating employment.

Under the DPP 2006, the offset value was fixed at 30% of defence deals above ₹300 crore, which was revised to ₹2,000 crore in DPP 2016 for full-import deals. The first offset contract was signed in 2007.

Auditing the offset deals till March 2018, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said 46 offset contracts were signed for ₹66,427 crore, and till December 2018, ₹19,223 crore worth of offsets should have been discharged. “However, the vendors have claimed discharge of only ₹11,396 crore, [i.e.,] 59%, of the offsets,” stated a report tabled in Parliament on September 23. Furthermore, the Ministry has accepted only ₹5,457 crore or 48% of these offset claims, while the rest were pending or rejected due to various deficiencies. The remaining offset commitments of about ₹55,000 crore would be due for completion by 2024, but the rate of the offset discharge has been about ₹1,300 crore per year. “Given this situation, fulfilling the commitment of ₹55,000 crore by the vendors in the next six years remains a major challenge,” the report said.

What did the CAG say on the Rafale deal offsets?

The IGA of the ₹60,000-crore deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets stated that the French side would facilitate implementation of ‘Make in India’ through offsets for 50% value of supply protocols, minus the value of performance-based logistics and simulator and training aids annual maintenance. The CAG said the French aircraft manufacturer, Dassault Aviation, and missile maker MBDA have till date “not confirmed” the transfer of technology to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) under the offset clause.

Also read | Investigative reports by N. Ram on the Rafale deal

According to the report, in September 2015, French companies Dassault Aviation and MBDA initially proposed to discharge 30% of their offset obligation in the Rafale deal by offering high technology to the DRDO, and as per the contract, acquisition of technology by the DRDO is envisaged subject to discussions between the vendor and the DRDO. In April 2016, the DRDO identified six new technologies to be obtained from the firms under the offset obligations, but the vendors “did not agree on transfer of five technologies as most of them were not within the vendor’s core competence”.

The sixth proposal of the DRDO was to obtain technical assistance for indigenous development of an engine, Kaveri, for the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). Stating that in October 2019, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had informed them that the vendor had not yet been able to confirm their capability for doing the requisite upgradation, the CAG said, “thus, it is not clear if this technology transfer will take place, and there is need for MoD/DRDO to identify and acquire the right technologies in order to comply with the directions of Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) given in September 2016.”

The MoD informed the CAG that the offset obligations under the Rafale deal were to start from September 23, 2019, and the first annual commitment would have to be completed by September 23, 2020. The CAG noted that the maximum discharge of offsets — 57% by MBDA and 58% by Dassault Aviation — had been slated during the last year, which is year seven from the date of contract.

Giving the Rafale deal as a reference, the report said, “In many cases, it was found that the foreign vendors made various offset commitments to qualify for the main supply contract, but later were not earnest about fulfilling these commitments.”

What is the status now?

In the new DAP 2020, which came into effect on October 1, the government has removed the requirement for offset clause in IGAs or in Rafale-like deals. “We removed some of the offset requirements as they are not working. From now on, there will be no offset clause in government-to-government, single vendor and IGAs,” said Director General (Acquisition), Apurva Chandra.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ip81a9/article32762640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10FRANCE-PARISBLAST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-hindu-explains-how-does-the-removal-of-offset-clause-requirement-affect-rafale-like-deals/article32762645.ece

According to Deputy SP (Task Force) Venkataiah, acting on information that several batches of red sanders smuggling operatives from Tamil Nadu had entered into the Seshachalam hills through Bhakarapeta, Yerravaripalem and KV Palle routes, special parties were dispatched into the hills to initiate combing operations. The official said that the rush of smuggling operatives into the hills was due to the lifting of the COVID-19 restrictions on movement of vehicles on the inter-State borders with Tamil Nadu.

“Our immediate focus is not only to flush out the trespassers from the forests, but also to prevent them from axing the valuable trees,” the Deputy SP said. It is observed that the smuggling activity which witnessed a slump during the last six months after the lockdown came into force in March is now felt once again in the hills, while nabbing of the operatives is also on the rise in recent weeks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jsgf24/article32767461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VJREDSANDERSTASKFORCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/red-sanders-task-force-steps-up-combing-in-seshachalam-hills/article32767462.ece
110,2020/10/04,"Thanks to erroneous data, A.P. tops country in cases booked against police","Crime records bureaus put the figure as 1,681 instead of actual 111

With the District Crime Records Bureau (DCRB) and the City Crime Records Bureau (CCRB) officials sending erroneous data on the cases registered against police personnel during 2019, Andhra Pradesh, with 1,681 such cases, has topped the list in the country in the recently released National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data.

The actual number of cases registered against the police, however, was 111 last year. The negligence of some staff has brought the dubious distinction to the State. The number of cases registered against police personnel was 97 in 2018.

DGP blames negligence

“Andhra Pradesh, which should have been in the ninth place in registering cases against police personnel, has topped the list due to negligence of some staff,” Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang told the The Hindu. The Andhra Pradesh police will write a letter to the NCRB, seeking correction of the data on the cases registered against police personnel in the State last year, he said.

Even the State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) officials did not check the data before sending it to the NCRB. The Chittoor DCRB staff have put the figure at 409, instead of actual four cases and the Visakhapatnam (Rural) DCRB sent the number of cases booked against police personnel in the district as 972 last year, while only two cases were registered.

Similarly, the Visakhapatnam CCRB sent the cases as 257, while only one such case was registered in the city last year. The SCRB officials forwarded the same data to the NCRB.

According to officials, Anantapur police registered 18 cases against their department staff on different charges last year, followed by Prakasam and West Godavari (13 each), Guntur Rural and Kurnool (12 each), Krishna (10) , Kadapa (9), Vijayawada Commissionerate (6), Rajamahendravaram (5), Chittoor (4), Vizianagaram (3), Visakhapatnam Rural (2), Guntur (Urban), East Godavari and Visakhapatnam Commissionerate Police and Guntakal Railway Police (one case each).

“The Visakhapatnam Rural, Visakhapatnam Commissionerate and Chittoor district put the cases in hundreds, which were only two, one and four cases respectively.

The second meeting of the Apex Council on the utilisation of water of the Godavari and the Krishna rivers is scheduled to be held in New Delhi on Tuesday (October 6).

Union Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat will take stock of the status of projects which pitted Andhra Pradesh and Telangana against each other.

The meeting assumes significance in the context of the tough stands taken by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his Telangana counterpart K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the projects such as the Rayalaseema lift irrigation scheme and the enhancement of the carrying capacity of the Pothireddypadu head regulator.

Telangana has sought a quick resolution of the issue arising from the Andhra Pradesh government’s plan to lift 3 tmcft of the Krishna waters from Srisailam project by augmenting the capacity of Pothireddypadu head regulator.

On the agenda

112,2020/10/04,"NDA govt. is autocratic, says Puducherry CM","‘The three new laws will deprive farmers of a competitive price’

Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayana Swamy has said that the country, at present, is witnessing an autocratic rule by the NDA government at the centre.

“The Union government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is neither bothered about the Opposition nor its alliance parties,” he told the media here after offering prayers at the Lord Venkateswara temple on Sunday.

Describing the three new farm laws as ‘anti-farmer’, Narayana Swamy said the contract farming system would deprive the marginal farmers of competitive prices for their produce. “With corporate firms having a final say in the procurement of produce, the farmers will be reduced to farm labourers. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is also being done away with,” he said, adding that the Shiromani Akali Dal has walked out of the NDA, protesting the three farm laws.

Accusing the NDA government of using the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to target its political opponents, Mr. Narayana Swamy said the tactics would not last long.

‘Adityanath must quit’

Referring to the Hathras case, he said, “There has been a total breakdown of law and order in Uttar Pradesh and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath must own the responsibility for it and resign. The way Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were stopped from visiting the village not only reflects the autocratic rule but also raises suspicion that the government is trying to hide something.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/zi90hs/article32767415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05ONG4PUDUCHERRYCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/nda-govt-is-autocratic-says-puducherry-cm/article32767416.ece
113,2020/10/04,Delay in resumption of RTC services to Telangana a cause for worry,"Talks hit a roadblock with TS insisting on parity in routes too; union seeks government intervention

The inordinate delay in resumption of the inter-State RTC bus services between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana after the lockdown, primarily due to differences over key issues such as parity in operations, is as worrying for the people as it is for the management of the public sector giant.

The deadlock continues even after three rounds of talks between the two sides.

Officials of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) had met their Telangana counterparts to discuss key issues and resume operations but, the talks hit a roadblock each time.

Admitting that the delay does not augur well for the APSRTC, which is reeling under serious financial crisis due to accumulated revenue loss over the years, the officials are eager to break the ice.

“We are trying our best to find a way forward, and we expect to get some clarity on the issue by Wednesday (October 7),” said the corporation’s Executive Director (Operations) K.S. Brahmananda Reddy.

Why the deadlock?

The APSRTC, which operates more number of buses to Telangana and covers a greater distance in terms of kilometers in the neighbouring State, had to make a difficult decision on reducing its operations to arrive at a parity in kilometers.

“Telangana now is insisting on parity in routes, which does not exist in any State agreements. We will have to look into it and discuss the issue threadbare before arriving at a decision,” Principal Secretary (Transport) and APSRTC Vice-Chairman and Managing Director M.T. Krishna Babu, had said, emerging from the talks.

Expressing concern over the fact that the RTC of both the Telugu States had been incurring a daily loss of around ₹5 crore due to the stalemate, leaders of the APSRTC Employees’ Union have urged the government to intervene and thrash out an early solution to the problem.

Private operators making hay

Meanwhile, making the best of the absence of the RTC buses on the road, the private operators have been fleecing the public by charging exorbitant fares.

With the Dasara festivities approaching, a large number of people who want to visit the neighbouring State are pinning hopes on resumption of RTC bus services by then.

Dasara is the time to earn some additional revenue for the RTC, which runs special buses to cater to the transport needs of the people.

In 2019, the APSRTC had operated 5,887 special buses, which brought a revenue of around ₹229 crore. In 2018, the festival season fetched a revenue of ₹209 crore.

Whether this year the festival will bring good tidings for the cash-strapped transport corporation is to be seen.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/delay-in-resumption-of-rtc-services-to-telangana-a-cause-for-worry/article32767352.ece

The southwest monsoon has been very kind to Andhra Pradesh this season with 10 out of 13 districts receiving excess rainfall from June 1 to October 1 (up to 8.30 a.m.).

The total quantum of water received from rainfall directly in the State and through inflows from the neighbouring states accounted for 8,585.66 tmcft.

The water audit of the SW monsoon revealed that out of 8,585.66 tmcft, we could utilise only 706.05 tmcft, which accounted for 8.22% of the available water in any form.

Post 8.30 a.m. on October 1, another 51.48 tmcft had been received (3.53 tmcft in the form of rain and 47.95 tmcft as inflows into rivers and streams).

A research study of COVID infections and contact tracing in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, published by the journal Science revealed that 70% of the COVID-19-infected individuals did not transmit it to others, while 8% transmitted and caused 60% of the new infections.

The research was conducted by the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, U.S., and the Governments of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, with information available as of August 1.

The article “Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in two Indian states” co-authored by A.P.’s Special Chief Secretary (Health, Medical and Family Welfare) K.S. Jawahar Reddy revealed several aspects of the COVID pandemic in the State.

It was found that secondary transmission was higher among children. In Andhra Pradesh, 17.86 lakh contacts had been identified and 7.89 lakh of them were tested.

127,2020/10/04,20 schoolchildren test positive in Vizianagaram dist.,"Education Dept. told not to reopen schools in containment zones

Twenty students of the Gantyada Zilla Parishad High School tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday.

Medical teams conducted tests for the children who have been attending school for the past 12 days following the instructions of the Vizianagaram District Medical and Health Officer, S.V. Ramanakumari.

“Fortunately, all the infected children looked healthy without any complaints and symptoms of COVID-19. However, we have shifted them to the Vizianagaram Government General Hospital for treatment. COVID-19 tests are being conducted for the family members and the primary and secondary contacts of the children,” said Ms. Ramanakumari.

“We requested the Education Department not to open the schools in containment zones. The issue has been brought to the notice of Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal and other officials concerned for necessary action,” she added.

Cases fall

Meanwhile, new infections have come down significantly in the district. From around 500 a day earlier, the cases dropped to 225 on Saturday. The death toll reached 188 but not fatalities have been reported in the last three days.

The total positive cases in the district are 35,997, recoveries 33,103 and active cases 2,706.

Confidence booster

128,2020/10/04,Vegetable prices take flight early in Chittoor dist.,"Trend will continue for a while amid heavy rain spells, say traders

Generally vegetable prices shoot up from mid-October ahead of the Deepavali festive season, followed by Karthika and Dhanur months, coupled with the Sabarimala season. This year it has happened quite early in Chittoor district in spite of its substantial contribution to vegetable cultivation in the western mandals. The rise in prices is attributed to a sudden slump in production due to the heavy rains since July.

The prices of beans, brinjal, ladies’ fingers, radish and several gourds have nearly doubled in a week. Onions at ₹60 a kg seem to be reviving the last year’s bitter experience for consumers, while tomato at ₹25 a kg is proving tough on many.

The size and quality of onions in the markets is unsatisfactory despite the sudden jump in the price. The arrival of onion stocks from the production belt in Maharashtra has been hindered by heavy rains. The same is the case with regard to the Kurnool variety, which is said to have suffered rain damage too.

Eggs in demand

Meanwhile, the demand for eggs and chicken has been rising. There seems to be a general feeling among the average consumer that instead of buying half a kg of vegetables, it is better to go for a quarter of a kg of chicken and get benefited with its protein value. “A dozen eggs hardly cost ₹60 even when in high demand whereas the regular vegetables are selling double their prices, making the former a better choice,” says Dhana Lakshmi, a homemaker from Santhapeta locality here.

The prices of chilli and ginger have also seen a steep hike in recent weeks as their yield suffered due to rains in the respective production belts.

Prabhakar, a vegetable trader from Palamaner, expects the trend to continue till January as another spell of heavy rain is likely during the northeast monsoon in winter months. “However, the likely lean Sabarimala pilgrimage season owing to COVID-19 threat could bring some relief in prices from next month,” he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/svxbk9/article32763352.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJVEEGETABLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vegetable-prices-take-flight-early-in-chittoor-dist/article32763353.ece

130,2020/10/04,A.P. ranks second in human trafficking,"245 cases, 425 victims rescued in 2019, NCRB

Andhra Pradesh has earned the dubious distinction of being ranked second in human trafficking in India, according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau data. Maharashtra leads the country in human trafficking.

In the year 2019, the State reported 245 cases of human trafficking under the Indian Penal Code. This formed 10.8% of the total number of human trafficking cases reported. The number of cases reported in the State increased by a small margin in the last two years, with 218 cases reported in 2017 and 240 in 2018.

With close to 100% of trafficked persons being women, (398 of the 399 victims trafficked were women), and all of the 425 victims rescued were women, it was evident that the majority of the victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation or prostitution. Of the total victims being trafficked for this purpose, Andhra Pradesh has the third highest number.

Of the total number of cases reported, 99.4% cases were charge sheeted. There was a conviction rate of 21.8% with only 52 cases resulting in conviction of the 238 in which trial was completed. This, however, was the highest number of convictions by any State. The number of persons arrested and convicted in Andhra Pradesh was substantially larger compared to the other States

The data revealed that 18 victims were below 18 years, out of 425 victims, 316 women were sexually exploited, one forced into labour, 31 women forced to work as domestic help, 14 forced into marriage, 63 for other reasons.

Charge sheets

The worrying part is there are 159 cases, which have been charge sheeted, and in just 52 cases, there were convictions. Trial was completed in 238 cases. But the initial action seemed to be positive with 825 persons arrested in 425 cases and charge sheets were filed against 512 persons, and 136 persons were convicted.

“This phenomenon vindicates our demand for setting up anti-human trafficking units in all districts and giving them powers on par with police stations. We need a special unit of police to deal with trafficking,” says Ongole based HELP organisation secretary N.V Rammohan.

The findings come in backdrop of October 5 being observed as International Day of No Prostitution and aims at increasing awareness about prostitution and is observed to oppose prostitution.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ap-ranks-second-in-human-trafficking/article32763319.ece

Vijayawada Municipal Corporation officials intercepted and seized a consignment of stale and rotten body parts of goat and sheep bound to Machilipatnam at the railway parcel counter on Saturday.

Acting on a tip-off by an anonymous phone caller at around 9 a.m., VMC’s veterinary assistant surgeon Dr. Ravi Chand and his team visited the railway station.

At around 11 a.m., after the Howrah-Yaswanthpur Express arrived at the station, 14 sealed boxes were dropped off at the parcel counter by porters. Officials who grew suspicious over the contents of the thermocol boxes opened them with the help of railway staff and found body parts of goat and sheep in a decomposed condition. The consignment was believed to be sent either from West Bengal or Odisha.

Officials traced the parcel recipient to one Kaza of Machilipatnam and were unable to contact him as the phone number given was not reachable. The meat, weighing around one tonne, was buried at a dumping yard in Pathapadu near the city.

Officials launched an investigation into the illegal trade and import of stale meat from other States. They suspect that the meat was imported to be sold in the district markets where prices are higher compared to that in northern States.

134,2020/10/04,Women activists decry inaction in Hathras incident,"Protest staged against Centre in city

Members of the State unit of the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW), the women’s wing of the Communist Party of India, on Saturday staged a protest demanding justice for the 19-year-old Dalit woman from Hathras in Uttar Pradesh who died after being allegedly gang-raped two weeks ago.

The members called attention to the growing atrocities against women in general in the last few years. They carried steel plates with saris, bangles, flowers and fruits, as a symbolic gesture to condemn police inaction in the Hathras case.

State general secretary of the Federation P. Durga Bhavani launched a sharp attack on the Central government.

“Under the NDA government, cows are safer than women and Dalits. The Hathras case is a reflection of the breakdown of law and order in the country. ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ has been reduced to a mere slogan as there has been a spurt in cases of sexual assault and rape in the last six years,” she said.

She alleged that while women were being targeted, the Modi government was busy implementing its ‘Hindutva’ agenda, dividing people of the country on religious lines.

The protesters recalled that Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani had presented bangles to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the Nirbhaya case, and said that they were repeating the act today to show the mirror to the ruling party at the Centre.

Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said that the Union Government is ready to extend all help to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) in meeting its drinking water requirements.

Speaking to reporters on Saturday after visiting the Papavinasanam dam, Mr. Shekhawat said Tirumala is a special place visited by thousands of devotees every day.

“The Union Government can understand the ever-increasing load on the temple administration and the dire need to improve drinking water amenities. The State government has already made plans to pump water from the Kalyani dam in Tirupati and has requested our support,” Mr. Shekhawat said.

“The Government of India is ready to assist should the proposals be routed through the State Government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already set a target of providing clean drinking water to every household in the country by 2024 and the possibilities of accommodating funds under the prestigious scheme will also be explored,” he said.

Irrigation Minister Anil Kumar Yadav who accompanied Mr. Shekhawat said that the government was committed to finding a permanent solution to the drinking water problem plaguing the temple town.

“The government has already resolved to take up the construction of Balaji reservoir (with 1 tmc capacity) in joint collaboration with the TTD. Now that the Union Minister has reacted positively, efforts will be made for the submission of the same at the earliest,” Mr. Yadav said.

BJP State spokesperson G. Bhanuprakash Reddy also briefed Mr. Shekhawat on the urgent need for addressing the drinking water requirements and gave him details about the ever-increasing footfalls at the Lord Venkateswara temple.

Officials of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) demolished a boundary wall and a constructed portion at the house of former MP and former Mayor Sabbam Hari, stating that they were unauthorised structures, in Visakhapatnam on Saturday morning.

After demolishing the boundary wall, the GVMC officials erected a fencing and said that around five to 10 feet of the space inside the house premises belongs to the corporation.

A large number of workers, and around 30 policemen along with the Town Planning department of GVMC, started the demolition activity from 4.30 a.m. on Saturday. It was learnt that the structure that was demolished by the GVMC was built for the use of workers at Mr. Hari’s house.

GVMC officials present at the spot claimed that they had already attached notices regarding the demolition at Mr. Hari’s house.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Hari said that he did not receive any notice from the GVMC.

“It was at around 4.30 a.m. when my workers woke me up and said that the boundary wall is being demolished. When I questioned the GVMC officials, they did not show me any notice, but claimed that they have received orders from senior officers,” Mr. Hari said.

“The government is targeting me as I am questioning the governance of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his failures. This is how the government is functioning in the State. As a law-abiding citizen, I will take up this issue in court,” the former Mayor said.

Responding to Mr. Hari’s allegations, Chief City Planner of the GVMC, R. Vidyullatha, said that the civic body has received representations from a number of citizens that the former Mayor had encroached upon a park. When the GVMC verified land records, it was found that around 12 feet of the park space was encroached upon by Mr. Hari, she said.

“When we tried to serve a notice, no one was available. It may be noted that when any government land is encroached, the department can take action immediately. However, the GVMC has attached the notice 24 hours before the demolition and had informed the residents,” she told reporters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2cxpll/article32763092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJPG4-DEMOLITION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/unauthorised-structures-at-former-mayors-house-razed/article32763088.ece

141,2020/10/04,"CPI decries ‘rising crimes’ against women, Dalits","Roundtable in Vijayawada on October 5, says party leader

CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna has condemned the “rising crimes” against women and Dalits, and said a roundtable is being organised in Vijayawada on October 5 in protest against the atrocities.

The savage attack on a 20-year-old girl at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh reflected the sordid state of affairs, he said in a press release on Saturday, asserting that the secretive manner in which the police got the victim’s body cremated midnight exposed the conspiracy to hush up the case.

On the other hand, the YSRCP turned a blind eye to the attacks on Dalits, he alleged. “They are being falsely implicated in cases and roughed up. Some were tonsured for standing up to the upper castes,” he added.

There were many attacks on Dalits in the recent months, and the police had not acted against the culprits as the government was least bothered about the plight of the oppressed sections.

Unfortunately, policemen were complicit in some attacks, but justice would elude the victims as the offenders had protection from people wielding clout in the government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cpi-decries-rising-crimes-against-women-dalits/article32763004.ece

143,2020/10/04,"Focus on creating facilities in Orvakal, Kopparthy, Thamminapatnam nodes","Plans drawn up for setting up common effluent treatment plants and supplying water to industries

While creating major infrastructure in the Visakhapatnam - Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC), the government is focusing on providing facilities in the Orvakal node in Kurnool district, which is being included in the Hyderabad - Bangalore corridor, for which the Centre has given the green signal.

This is a project undertaken by the National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust.

Airport project

Industries & Commerce Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy instructed the APIIC and other government agencies concerned to promote industries in Orvakal, where an airport is being built by the AP Airports Development Corporation.

Besides, Kopparthy industrial park in Kadapa district and Thamminapatnam in Nellore are going to be developed as a part of the VCIC and Chennai - Bangalore Industrial Corridor respectively, according to official sources.

Plans have been drawn up in advance for setting up common effluent treatment plants and supplying water to the industries likely to be set up in the corridors.

Road expansion

More importantly, the AP Road Development Corporation is embarking on a major expansion of roads passing through the corridors and linking up the seaports, to facilitate faster transportation of goods.

Steps are taken to attract industries to the Naidupet cluster in Nellore, which has a major locational advantage in terms of its proximity to the Krishnapatnam port.

The AP-Transco is augmenting its infrastructure to meet the emerging requirement.

Some projects are undertaken with support from the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund, a partnership between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.K. Government’s Department for Industrial Development (DFID), the Asian Development Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation.

The government has also contemplated to set up State-level and district Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) Centres for improving the business environment, thereby maintain the lead in EoDB rankings. While this is so, the government is aggressively promoting Tirupati as a destination for Information Technology (IT) and IT-Enabled Services (ITES) companies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/focus-on-creating-facilities-in-orvakal-kopparthy-thamminapatnam-nodes/article32762996.ece
144,2020/10/04,Vegetable prices go up as heavy rain hits standing crops,"Stock arrivals have fallen by 40 % in the wholesale market in Kalaburagi

The prices of vegetables and green leaves have gone up in Kalaburagi district as supply has been affected due to damage of fresh vegetables in a large area caused by incessant rainfall in the last two months.

A visit to temporary vegetable markets functioning at various places in the city revealed that the prices of bottle gourd, bitter gourd, brinjal, lady’s finger, capsicum, potato, tomato and green leaves, including coriander, spinach, and fenugreek, have sky-rocketed.

The price of almost all vegetables has increased from ₹ 50 per kg to ₹ 80 per kg. Capsicum, lady’s finger, cauliflower, carrot and cucumber are being sold at ₹ 100 per kg, which was earlier available at ₹ 60 per kg.

Garlic is being sold at ₹ 200 per kg.

Among the green leaves, fenugreek leaves (methi) is super expensive in the market with a bunch being sold at ₹ 40 in retail.

As the standing vegetable crops have suffered damage, arrivals in the wholesale market have fallen by 40 %.

Vegetable sellers Siddu and Veeresh said that vegetables were now being transported from far-off places. “Most of the retailers are bringing vegetable stock from neighbouring taluks and even from neighbouring districts. “As transportation charge is a major component while fixing prices of vegetables and fruits, this additional burden has to be ultimately recovered from retailers and the consumers,” said another vegetable seller Dashrath.

Yet another retail vegetable seller Mohammad Jelani said that “a bag of 10 kg vegetables was priced at ₹ 200 to ₹ 250 in the wholesale market during the month of June and July; now, I pay around ₹ 400 to ₹ 600 per for the same quantity. And, a bunch of methi leaves is being charged around ₹ 25 for retailers themselves,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vegetable-prices-go-up-as-heavy-rain-hits-standing-crops/article32766116.ece
145,2020/10/04,VTU to offer degree programmes on campus— two in Belagavi and one in Muddenahali,"Computer Science and Business Systems, Robotics and Automation to be available in HQ

Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) will now offer a few graduate programmes on its campuses in Belagavi and Muddenahalli of Chikkaballapur.

The three Bachelor of Technology programmes — two in Belagavi and one in Muddenahalli — will be of four years, on-campus and fully residential courses.

The programmes in Computer Science and Business Systems and Robotics and Automation will be offered in Belagavi and the Mechanical and Smart Manufacturing will be offered in Muddenahalli near Chikkaballapur.

These AICTE-approved courses will be industry-driven and run by the VTU following a memorandum of understanding with industries and research and development institutions.

“We have signed MoUs with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the Central Manufacturing Technology Institute (CMTI) and the MTAB to run these courses,” VTU Vice-Chancellor Karisiddappa told The Hindu.

“This will better chisel our course towards better industry-academia interaction. This will also provide the industry with skilled youth who have specialised training,” he said.

According to him, the MoUs allow the partner institutions to train VTU faculty for the new programmes, organise guest lectures and engage with the university for the continuous assessment of the students.

“The intake for each course would be 30. Students can choose the seats during the KEA counselling session from this academic year,” said Registrar (Academic) Anand Deshpande.

The fee will be regulated by VTU. It is the same as the fee in other government engineering colleges, he added.

According to him, the courses have been planned in such a way so as to ensure that the students graduating from the programme not only know the core topics but also develop an equal appreciation of humanities, management sciences and human values.

In all the three courses, experiential learning mode will be followed to make students industry-ready, Dr. Deshpande said.

In the Computer Science and Business Systems, students will be exposed to analytics, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and related subjects.

Students of Robotics and Automation will go through smart technologies, methods of synthesis, analysis and optimisation of newer robots and mechanisms, Mobile Robotics, 3D Robotics, and Robotics and e-commerce. In machine learning, students will be trained in manufacturing processes, manufacturing systems, systems engineering, IT, Networks and basic shop floor communications.

Students organisations have welcomed this, though with a caution.

“We are happy that VTU is starting degree courses on campus. That would help poor students get quality education at reasonable fees. However, we have some doubts about the longevity of these industry-driven courses,” said AIDSO secretary Mahantesh Bilur.

“Will the VTU close down these courses after a few years when the corporates feel that they no longer need these engineers trained in niche technologies? VTU should promise that these courses will be continued even after the companies stop their patronage,’’ he said.

VTU should not stop at a few courses. It should start a full-fledged engineering college on its Belagavi campus, said social activist Ashok Chandaragi. He said that he had sent a letter to the Chief Minister’s Office demanding the establishment of government engineering colleges in the backward districts of each one of the revenue divisions in the State. His memorandum also urges the VTU to set up a state-of-the-art research laboratory on the Belagavi campus of the university.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vtu-to-offer-degree-programmes-on-campus-two-in-belagavi-and-one-in-muddenahali/article32766031.ece

Mr. Kalyan told journalists that he had filed a police complaint that Shivanand Wali, a self-declared astrologer from Beelagi in Bagalkot district who currently resides in Belagavi, had abducted his wife Ashwini, and her parents Radhika and Krishna Satvik. The complaint alleges that Mr. Wali had gained control over Mr. Krishna’s mind and forced him to transfer ₹19.8 lakh to him. Mr.Kalyan added that Mr. Wali also forced Mr. Krishna to transfer valuable property to the astrologer.

Under the astrologer’s influence, the Satviks and their daughter had left Bengaluru and were living in Belagavi, the lyricist alleged.

He said that Ganga Kulkarni, a woman who was employed as a cook in his house in Bengaluru, had introduced discord in his family. “The cook and astrologer have influenced my wife’s mind and forced her to change her behaviour towards me. She has begun to treat me as a stranger,” he said.

Mr. Kalyan said that he wants to reunite with his wife. “I am sure her behaviour will change if she undergoes a few hours of counselling. I am confident that I will regain her affection. I will write a love song for her and and make her sing it,” he said.

Police Commissioner K. Thiyagarajan said that the city police is investigating the case. “We are focusing on points related to financial transactions and property transfer. Our officers are trying to find out if this was done under duress or fraud as is alleged,” he said.

Meanwhile, investigating officers said that Mr. Kalyan’s wife has contradicted his claims. Ms. Ashwini met inspector B.R. Gaddekar of Mala Maruti police station, and told him that she and her husband were facing problems in their marriage. She also refuted the charge they were victims of abduction, said the police.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/96m8my/article32764906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kalyan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/family-abducted-kannada-lyricist-k-kalyan-files-complaint/article32764907.ece

Karnataka Tourism Minister C.T. Ravi, who has been appointed as the BJP General Secretary, has submitted his resignation to the Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa.

The resignation, which was tendered on Saturday, has not been accepted yet, said sources at the Chief Minister's Office.

“I have tendered the resignation since it will be difficult to manage two posts simultaneously. I have to give more time to the organisation as a party functionary,” the Minister told press persons here on Sunday. The decision over the resignation is left to the party high command, he said, adding that his priority was the organisation.

“I tendered the resignation to the Chief Minister on the day of Gandhi Jayanthi,” said Mr. Ravi. Sources at the CMO said that the CM is likely to wait for the party’s decision before acting on the resignation.They clarified that though the date of resignation is October 2, Mr. Ravi met the CM on Saturday morning.

He said that a party meeting is scheduled for Monday, and that the responsibilities to the newly-appointed office bearers would be distributed then.

Soon after his elevation in the party, it was widely speculated that he would step down from the Cabinet, keeping with the party’s ‘one man, one post’ rule. Mr. Ravi, however, had said that the rule could be relaxed.

With Mr. Ravi’s resignation, the number of vacancies in the State Cabinet will go up to seven, which is likely to give some breathing space to Mr. Yeddyurappa, who is under pressure to expand his cabinet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mbhctb/article32764878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KPATHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-minister-ct-ravi-tenders-resignation-after-appointment-as-bjp-general-secretary/article32764879.ece

Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar on Saturday held a meeting with department officials, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy and JD(S) legislators A. Manjunath and Suresh Gowda and asked the department to resurvey the acquisition of lands for industrial areas in Nagamangala.

Mr. Kumaraswamy said orders had been issued for acquiring irrigated and plantation areas for industrial areas. It was better to acquire dry lands instead of irrigated areas in the Nagamangala taluk. Industrial estate was needed for development of the taluk and to provide jobs, the JD(S) leader said.

Mr. Shettar, who heard the problems expressed by JD(S) leaders, told department officials to resurvey the land for acquisition for industrial purposes.

150,2020/10/04,Siddaramaiah warns of stir if caste census report is not accepted,"₹167.77 crore had been spent to conduct the survey

The State government has to accept the socio-economic survey report (popularly known as caste census) prepared and submitted by the Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said on Saturday, and warned the government that the Congress would support the agitation of the backward classes if it did not do so.

The report was submitted to the commission’s then member secretary Mohammed Mohsin (Backward Classes Welfare Department) on September 21, 2019, by the then chairman H. Kantharaj.

Report ‘leaked’

In the run-up to the 2018 Assembly elections, the report’s “leaked” data had created a flutter in political circles by suggesting that the numerical strength of castes could be significantly different from what was traditionally assumed. The report’s content was never officially made known.

At a press conference organised by the Karnataka Backward Classes Federation here on Saturday, Mr. Siddaramaiah said his government had ordered the commission to conduct the survey in 2015. A whopping ₹167.77 crore was spent to conduct the survey and identify the socio-economic conditions of the backward classes.

The government seems to have not accepted the report, said Mr. Siddaramaiah and urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Health and Family Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu to accept it. Interestingly, Mr. Sriramulu recently said the report was never officially submitted to the government.

Backward classes people would come to the streets and launch an agitation against the government if the report was not accepted and implemented, the former Chief Minister warned.

‘Constitute commission’

The Congress leader also demanded the re-constitution of the commission. Commission’s chairperson and members have not been appointed by the government after Mr. Kantharaj’s resignation, Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

The Centre had already constituted the commission. The Supreme Court too had given a ruling for permanent constitution of the commission, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/s6y6xq/article32763444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGSIDDARAMAIAHP6,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/siddaramaiah-warns-of-stir-if-caste-census-report-is-not-accepted/article32763446.ece
151,2020/10/04,Derecognition of school harsh: Karnataka HC,"Case relates to taking students on educational tour without permission

The Karnataka High Court has held that harsh punishment like withdrawal of recognition to a school cannot be imposed citing a road accident that occurred during an educational excursion conducted without permission from the authorities and not using State-owned public transport.

“Section 39 of the Karnataka Education Act, which empowers the government to withdraw recognition, by any stretch of imagination cannot be interpreted or stretched to such an extent that it would encompass such untoward incidents occurred outside the school premises,” the court said while making it clear that recognition could be withdrawn for specific deficiencies in maintaining standard of education, infrastructure, etc. as per the Act.

Justice R. Devdas passed the order while allowing a petition filed by Poornaprajna Education Centre, Bhadravati, which had questioned the May 13, 2019 order of withdrawal of recognition passed by the Deputy Director (Administration), Department of Public Instruction, Shivamogga.

A tenth class student died and 22 others were injured when one of the two private bus in which students and teachers were travelling overturned in N.R. Pura police station limits in Chikkamagalur district in November 2018.

The educational authorities had said that the tour was conducted without prior permission and private buses were used contrary to the January 27, 2011 circular, which advised the use of State-owned public buses for school tours and avoiding private buses.

‘Deliberate attempt’

“An unfortunate road accident has been held against the petitioner-institution and a deliberate attempt is being made to punish the school authorities by withdrawing the recognition granted,” the High Court said.

The court noticed that the school and its management had so far spent ₹22 lakh towards medical expenses of children, besides cooperating and assisting the parents before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal for securing compensation as per the law.

Also, the court observed that, “On the whole, it seems that the authorities are carried away by public opinion and vested interests making wild allegations against the petitioner-institution” without considering the institution’s explanations given to all the notices issued by the authorities.

One of the students of the school, which is well recognised in Bhadravati, was a State topper in the SSLC exam of 2016 by securing 100% marks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/derecognition-of-school-harsh-karnataka-hc/article32763393.ece
152,2020/10/04,"Despite thousands of objections, consortium rules out technical glitches in CLAT","Students unhappy, question review of so many complaints in a span of three days

Despite receiving thousands of objections from students regarding technical glitches in the Common Law Admission Test 2020 that was held last month, the Consortium of National Law Universities on Saturday said that not a single complaint was valid.

Candidates, however, have questioned how the consortium reviewed thousands of complaints in a span of three days. Sources said that over 40,000 objections were raised. The consortium refused to confirm the number, though admitted that it ran into several thousands.

In a release it said that the expert committee had “randomly” examined the audit log of the number of candidates who had raised objections to the response sheet, and did not find any discrepancy between the two. “The audit log showed that one candidate had changed the response as many six times and the system recorded the 6th and the final response. Thus the apprehension that earlier response was not changed has no basis,” the release said.

Candidates whom The Hindu spoke to are not satisfied with the consortium’s response and state that the answers they had chosen and submitted while writing the online test were different from what had been finally marked. For instance, if a candidate had chosen option ‘c’ in the test, in the answer sheet, he or she has been graded for option ‘b’.

A candidate who raised an objection said, “Candidates are sure of the options they have marked and the consortium has ruined the prospects of meritorious students to get into these prestigious universities.” Another candidate, while demanding a retest, claimed that a bug in the software caused errors in her answer sheet. Still others allege that there were a range of problems which included questions being asked from out of the syllabus.

The expert committee stated that the service provider who helped in the conduct of the test has a track record of successfully conducting various national level tests. “The audit trail of each candidate is the most authentic evidence of every click and mouse movement, in case of a dispute, service provider shall make available to the court the audit trail of the concerned candidate,” said Faizan Mustafa, Vice-Chancellor of NALSAR University of Law (NALSAR), Hyderabad, and permanent member of the governing body of the Consortium said.

From next year, candidates with grievances to be charged

While denying that there were errors on the part of the consortium in conducting the test, a committee which was set up to look into the grievances noted that a large number of unnecessary objections were filed because they do not charge students to raise objections.

“CLAT-2020 had made filing of objections absolutely free and therefore the number of objections filed was so high. On the expert committee’s recommendation, the executive committee and governing body of the consortium have resolved that from next year a fee would be imposed for the filing of objections and if the objection is accepted, the fee paid should be refunded,” the consortium in the release said.

Three questions for UG exam and one PG examination dropped in CLAT

Controversy continues to dog the Common Law Admission Test 2020 that was held last month. The Consortium of National Law Universities, on Saturday, announced that three questions in the undergraduate CLAT examination and one question in the PG CLAT have been dropped. Students will not be graded on these questions.

The consortium said that answer keys of four questions have been changed - one each in English and Current Affairs including GK and two in Quantitative Techniques. “The expert committee did not recommend any change in Legal Reasoning and Logical Reasoning. Similarly, no change will be there in the PG examination key,” the press release said.

CLAT-2020, which is the entrance test for admissions into 22 National Law Universities across the country, was held on September 28. A total of 78 percent of 75,183 candidates who had registered for the test appeared for the test.

Several candidates had also claimed that they were denied the use of a calculator in the CLAT 2020, while it was allowed in the mock. The consortium has said that the calculator was provided in the mocks without the approval of CLAT Convener or the Executive Committee of the CLAT 2020. It added that candidates were duly informed about the non-availability of calculators prior to the test.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/despite-thousands-of-objections-consortium-rules-out-technical-glitches-in-clat/article32763349.ece
153,2020/10/04,Experts stress need to further probe asymptomatic patients,"Although a large number of patients testing positive for COVID-19 are categorised as “asymptomatic”, doctors and medical experts say many of them are not “truly asymptomatic”. They may not have listed their symptoms accurately, and experts point out that there is a need to ask more questions and probe further.

M.K. Sudarshan, chairman of the State COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said: “After probing, many patients reveal that they had fever for one or two days and it had gone away after they took medicines. So, it is important for doctors to probe and diagnose their symptoms accurately.”

Sources in the Department of Health and Family Welfare pointed out that many the patients who were classified as “asymptomatic” were under home isolation and not reporting their symptoms accurately to avoid hospital admission.

Overworked staff

He also admitted that in many cases, healthcare professionals who are overworked and are facing burnout may not be reporting the symptoms accurately as the number of positive cases reported are on the rise.

Another doctor working in a government hospital in the city pointed out that with doctors seeing multiple patients a day, the time spent with each patient has reduced. “As a result, there is very little scope for taking down detailed patient history or conducting detailed investigation,” the doctor said.

H.M. Prasanna, president-elect, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said many patients under home isolation delay coming to the hospitals as they feel they do not have symptoms.

“When people are under home isolation, they need to pay attention to symptoms and report accurately. They also need to do basic investigations even if they are unable to report symptoms. We often find that patients have pneumonia when we do a CT scan. But they come to the hospital late and this increases fatality rate,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/experts-stress-need-to-further-probe-asymptomatic-patients/article32763052.ece

The incident occurred when she had kept her petty shop, which is attached to her house, open to sell essential items during the lockdown and also offer water to customers.

“I bent forward to give the biscuit packet to the customer. He pulled my necklace and sped away on a scooter. I am happy to get the necklace back from the police,” said Ms. Seeta, who was among the many who received stolen property following the property parade held by Police Commissioner Vikash Kumar Vikash here on Saturday. The Mulki police used the footage of the CCTVs in the area and arrested Siddiq A., a first-time offender, who had stolen Ms. Seeta’s necklace. “Following lockdown, the accused had lost his and he ventured into chain snatching,” said Assistant Commissioner of Police (North) K. Belliyappa.

‘Lost hope’

Janaki, 66, a resident near Urva Rice Mill, said she had almost lost the hope of getting back her stolen gold necklace. The motorcylce-borne thief had snatched her necklace when she was walking towards her house after visiting Urva Marigudi Temple on June 3, 2017, at 10.30 a.m. “Just before the start of the lockdown, the police informed of the arrest of the thief. I am glad to get my chain back,” said Ms. Janaki.

Among others who got back their stolen property included Vidya Prabhu, owner of a petrol bunk in Surathkal, from whose vacant residential apartment thieves had stolen ₹50,000 cash and 200 grams of gold ornaments on August 18. “We have received the cash and part of the stolen gold ornaments. We hope to get the remaining items shortly,” Ms. Prabhu said.

Mr. Vikash said that of the ₹9.05 crore worth property stolen 2019-20, the city police recovered property worth ₹5.37 crore from arrested persons. Following clearance from the court, the city police on Saturday gave away property worth ₹1.49 crore. It included 2.277 kg of gold ornaments, 25 two-wheelers, 19 mobile phones, ₹48 lakh cash, and other articles.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/j9f9wi/article32763042.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BGPARADE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/two-elderly-women-among-those-who-get-back-stolen-items/article32763043.ece

But 2020 is unlike any year in recent memory, with a pandemic bringing normal life to a halt. That said, as restrictions ease and families acclimatise themselves to a life where social distancing and face masks are the norm, many have started making travel plans for the holidays.

As the tourism sector is seeing signs of recovery, some companies – travel and insurance – have started offering COVID-19 insurance to encourage travellers to venture out despite the pandemic.

MakeMyTrip, for instance, has started offering a COVID-19 specific insurance for travellers. “People are putting their trust back in travel, one step at a time. The pandemic has changed consumer behaviour in many ways and when it comes to travel, safety naturally tops the priority chart. The uncertainty of these times has pushed travellers to opt for the insurance options more than before. Mapping this trend, MakeMyTrip rolled out an option for COVID-19 insurance, which benefits travellers with coverage of ₹2 lakh per customer, while air insurances typically have lower cover for health issues,” a spokesperson of MakeMyTrip told The Hindu.

The insurance covers hospitalisation for 16 days post-travel in case of COVID-19 infection as it usually takes around 14 days for the virus to surface, unlike air insurances which cover illness for the day of travel or up to 72 hours, the spokesperson explained. Other benefits covered under the COVID-19 insurance include zero restrictions on room rent, consumables, post-hospitalisation diagnostics, etc.

“A health crisis like COVID-19 demanded special attention and benefits that extend support beyond the normal. To address this need, the company has introduced special insurance of this nature for the first time. We are seeing a good uptake for this insurance considering people prioritising their health and safety more than ever before,” the spokesperson added.

Sanjar Imam, president of the Karnataka Tourism Forum, said most of those who are travelling are opting for travel insurance that covers emergency hospitalisation and medical expenses incurred on the treatment of COVID-19. “A couple of travel companies are offering the insurance for free when a package of a certain amount is booked. However, it is really not a value-add as the premium amount gets built in the package or is considered instead of discounting,” he added.

Meanwhile, the sector is reporting “encouraging signs” since travel restrictions were eased, bringing major relief to months of lull, and most players are pinning their hopes on the upcoming holidays.

“Within Karnataka, weekends are doing fairly well, especially in the higher segment, as hotels are almost full. Weekdays are suffering still with 20% to 30% occupancy. Travel beyond Karnataka has not picked up yet. But the premium sector is seeing some recovery. In the higher segment, people are driving out of Bengaluru for weekends, especially if they are extended,” Mr. Imam said.

According to MakeMyTrip, there is a surge in the number of searches and bookings for short-haul trips, more so to destinations located within 300 km from metro cities.

“Even as demand for outbound tourism will stay soft, we are seeing good traction for Dubai and Maldives as travel opens up to the two short-haul international destinations from India,” a spokesperson said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vhoqzn/article32763028.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGTOURISM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-insurance-to-reassure-travellers-as-tourism-picks-up/article32763029.ece
156,2020/10/04,"Pandemic hits cancer, renal patients hard","Patients with comorbidities need special care, which not all COVID-19 hospitals can provide

COVID-19 infected patients with comorbidities, especially renal issues and cancer who need specialised care, are finding it hard to get admission in hospitals as not all have the required facility to treat them.

With only a few government hospitals having dialysis facilities for COVID-19 patients, triaging of positive renal patients has become difficult, say BBMP staff involved in triaging patients.

Although most private hospitals now have a few dialysis machines set aside for COVID-19 patients, only a fraction of them are available under the government quota. People who cannot afford private treatment are forced to wait till they get admitted under government quota.

“While it is a big challenge to get admission for a patient who needs dialysis, it is even more difficult to triage a positive patient who needs both dialysis and an ICU bed as very few hospitals have both. Recently, we struggled to get admission for a 75-year-old male patient, who was brought from Hassan to Bengaluru for treatment. He required dialysis and ventilator and he had Hepatitis B. Although we managed to admit him in St. Martha’s Hospital, he did not survive,” said Tauseef Ahmed, a volunteer from Emergency Response Team (ERT), a group working in coordination with the BBMP and 108 in triaging patients. Mr. Ahmed said it is all the more difficult in case of cancer patients as Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology is the only government cancer hospital. “Some private hospitals that have oncology facilities refuse to take patients if there are complications,” he said, adding that there is no clarity on which hospitals have nephrology and oncology services available.

A senior doctor from Kidwai said surgeries and other procedures, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy in positive patients, are being put off till they test negative.

“Cancer surgeries are long duration ones and in any surgery there is a need to insert an endotracheal tube through the mouth into the trachea (windpipe) to help the patient breathe. This is risky and anaesthetists refuse to intubate a positive patient. With around 70 of our staff members, including the director, getting infected, we have made it a rule to wait till the patient tests negative,” said the doctor.

Admitting that this was delaying timely treatment to cancer patients, the doctor said: “We are attending to all emergencies, including surgical. The out-patient department is fully functioning and the number of patients walking in have increased after the lockdown eased.”

Sudarshan Ballal, chairman of Manipal Hospitals, said that although there was a problem initially, most large hospitals have dialysis facilities now. “Dialysis units are the lifeline of renal patients. It is important that they do not miss their regular dialysis,” he said. “COVID-19 patients with pre-existing kidney disease are a vulnerable group and it is risky for them if dialysis is delayed,” he said.

R. Ravindra, president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said some hospitals have reserved dialysis beds for government patients. “The government has agreed to pay us extra for dialysis of COVID-19 patients referred by the government. We have told our member hospitals to not refuse any dialysis patient,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vuonnj/article32763018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGDIALYSIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pandemic-hits-cancer-renal-patients-hard/article32763019.ece
157,2020/10/04,"State fixes plasma rate at ₹7,500 per unit","There were plaints of

Following complaints that many hospitals that are authorised to have plasma banks are collecting charges arbitrarily, the State Health Department on Saturday fixed ₹7,500 for every unit of plasma.

An order to this effect was issued on Saturday by Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare).

The authorised plasma banks can collect the amount towards processing the plasma, the order stated.

HCG Plasma Bank

U.S. Vishal Rao, who heads HCG Plasma Bank set up in association with the State government, said the bank was charging ₹9,500 per unit that includes antibody testing of the patient.

“We have given plasma to over 750 patients so far from our bank and have recorded 60% recovery rate,” he said.

However, the charges in some hospitals range between ₹9,000 and ₹11,500, he said.

9,886 new cases

Meanwhile, the State on Saturday reported 9,886 new COVI-19 cases taking the total number of cases to 6,30,516. With 100 deaths, the toll rose to 9,219. This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths.

As many as 8,989 persons were discharged on Saturday taking the total number of recoveries to 5,08,495. Active cases continued to remain over a lakh (1,12,783).

Of these, 841 patients are being monitored in the Intensive Care Units.

Bengaluru Urban reported 3,925 cases taking the tally to 2,45,700. With 21 of the 100 deaths from Bengaluru, the toll in this district rose to 3,045.

As many as 84,922 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, including 36,514 rapid antigen tests.

158,2020/10/04,"Update details on app or else face action, govt. tells private hospitals","The State Health Department has directed private medical establishments to update all COVID-19 related details of their institutions in the government’s Facility App, failing which action will be initiated against them. An order to this effect has been issued by Health Director Om Prakash Patil.

“Some private medical establishments are cooperating with the government in admissions and clinical case management of the positive patients referred by the government or the local body. But not all are updating details on the app on a regular and timely basis. This is causing hardship and delays in total data harvesting for planning and implementing screening, referral, treatment, and follow up,” the order said. Hence, all private medical establishments should mandatorily update all COVID-19 details on the app or face action, the order added.

In another order, the Health Department directed private hospitals to compulsorily test patients with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) for COVID-19. Although private hospitals have been entering details of ILI/SARI patients who are coming to their clinics on the prescribed portal, they are not sending the patients for testing to swab collection centres.

‘Late identification’

Delay in testing such patients would result in late identification of COVID-19 in them, the order said.

The hospitals should test such patients for COVID-19 in their facility if they have in-house testing facility or draw their swab and send to the ICMR-approved private or government labs.

The private establishments can charge ₹200 per patient, while the testing is free in government labs, the order added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/35ej05/article32763002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bgbgyasOrdersIMG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/update-details-on-app-or-else-face-action-govt-tells-private-hospitals/article32763003.ece

Speaking at the ‘prarthana samavesha’ organised by Karnataka Bhajana Parishat in Dharmasthala on Saturday, he said that the training will enable people to learn singing bhajans in the global level. He said that instead of the annual bhajan training sessions, a one day ‘prarthana samavesha’ was organised in Dharmasthala this year on account of COVID-19.

The training sessions held so far have succeeded in infusing spiritual consciousness among the participants, he said adding that the sessions also helped participants to cultivate life discipline, patience, habit of respecting others, and develop ‘bhakthi’.

160,2020/10/04,Bypoll: Choice for R.R. Nagar ticket gives some tense moments,"State unit has recommended two names for the seat

The exercise to decide who gets the Bharatiya Janata Party ticket to contest the upcoming R.R. Nagar bypoll appears to has turned into a platform for factionalism and lobbying with the central leadership.

As Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has been strongly favouring giving the ticket to defector Munirathna — who quit the Congress to join the BJP and helped the former in forming the government — those leading the party organisation, reportedly in concurrence with party national general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santhosh, have been favouring Tulasi Muniraju Gowda. Mr. Gowda, a local BJP leader, had not only fought against Mr. Munirathna in successive elections but also challenged his 2018 victory on the grounds of election malpractices. The BJP State core committee that met two days ago recommended both the names, putting the ball in the high command’s court.

“Not just the Chief Minister, even the BJP had promised defectors tickets and ministership in the government and neither of them can afford to go back on that promise. The BJP has not let down any defectors across the country,” a strategist close to the Chief Minister argued.

Munirathna’s baggage

However, there has always been resistance within the party to Mr. Munirathna joining them. “Mr. Munirathna, while he was a Congress MLA, had harassed our councillors and faced several corruption cases. The BJP had fought against him bitterly, exposed election malpractices and challenged his election as well. That baggage is still there and many in the party are not happy with his possible candidature,” a senior leader in the organisation said. Many point out that though R. Roshan Baig had also resigned, his entry into the party was blocked over similar concerns and R. Shankar was denied ticket in the bypolls and later made and an MLC.

Given the support for Mr. Gowda by the party organisation, the Chief Minister’s camp is keeping its fingers crossed, sources said. “If Mr. Munirathna is not given ticket, it will be another major embarrassment to the Chief Minister,” a senior leader close to Mr. Yediyurappa said. Recently, the party Central leadership chose dark horses late Ashok Gasti and Eranna Kadadi for Rajya Sabha elections even though the Chief Minister had sent a different set of names.

Meanwhile, three defectors who are now MLCs — A.H. Vishwanath, Mr. Shankar and N. Nagaraju (MTB) — are already putting pressure on the Chief Minister to induct them into the Cabinet. It is uncertain if it will happen soon in the light of the bypolls.

Rajesh Gowda joins BJP

C.M. Rajesh Gowda, a radiologist and son of the former Congress MP C.P. Mudalagiriyappa, joined the BJP on Saturday.

His is one of the three names the State core committee has suggested as candidate for the Sira bypoll. “There seems to be a consensus among the leaders that Dr. Gowda will be the best bet in Sira,” a senior party functionary said.

Dr. Gowda was a business partner of Siddaramaiah’s son Yathindra Siddaramaiah and the firm they were directors in came under attack by the BJP over an alleged land scam in 2016. Dr. Yathindra quit the firm later.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/90vy5/article32735439.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGBSY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bypoll-choice-for-rr-nagar-ticket-gives-some-tense-moments/article32762988.ece

Five lakh new students have enrolled in government schools in Kerala in the last three years with the focus on upgrading them as “Centres of Excellence” with modern facilities, according to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

Though in the past there were discussions in society about closure of government schools, now these were being improved, resulting in them attracting more students, he said.

Mr. Vijayan was speaking after dedicating 90 schools as “Centres of Excellence” and laying the foundation stone virtually for 54 school buildings on Saturday as part of the government’s Public Education Rejuvenation Campaign to protect the public education system in the State.

He said the government was implementing changes in the field of school education keeping in mind the next generation.

164,2020/10/04,Phone bribe allegation: Ramesh Chennithala to sue builder,"He said he had purchased expensive phone for the leader

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has said that he will sue the private builder who alleged in a recent court filing that he had purchased an expensive mobile phone for the Congress leader at the behest of gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) had held the submission aloft in an attempt to put Mr. Chennithala in a spot.

The builder’s name had emerged in the public domain after the UAE Red Crescent contracted him to construct 140 dwellings for the poor at Thrissur. Life Mission, a State agency, had facilitated the project.

Recently, the builder had come under Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) scrutiny on suspicion of violating the provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010, by partnering with the UAE charity.

‘₹9-crore bribe’

The builder deposed that he had paid ₹9 crore as bribe to various intermediaries, including Swapna and UAE consulate officials, to bag the ₹20-crore construction contact.

The businessperson had bought five expensive phones in 2019 for Swapna, who allegedly told him that the devices were for select attendees at the UAE National Raising Day celebration at the consulate in 2019.

At the time, Swapna was a senior consulate official and the master of ceremonies at events organised by the diplomatic mission. The builder had deposed that the phones were a minor part of the substantial bribe component.

In a separate court filing, Swapna had “admitted” that she had received brokerage from the builder for nudging the UAE contract in his direction.

Mr. Chennithala had attended the function as the chief guest. He later clarified that the organisers had welcomed him with a shawl, which he gave away immediately.

He had not accepted any other gift though there was a raffle for attendees. A personal aide of his received a wristwatch as a lottery.

Simultaneously, Mr. Chennithala moved the police to use the IMEI number of the gift phones to trace the recipients. He also hinted that kin of the ruling political front had received expensive phones as gifts from Swapna.

Meanwhile, the CPI(M) has demanded the resignation of Mr. Chennithala for “violating” protocol.

165,2020/10/04,GST Council meeting | Kerala to reject two alternatives presented by Union government,"GST Council meeting will try and resolve Centre-States’ compensation tussle.

Kerala has decided to stick to its stance to reject the two alternatives presented by the Union government for paying out this year’s compensation to States on account of the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

Finance Mininster Nirmala Sitharaman will chair the Council’s 42nd meeting on Monday, where possible solutions are expected to be discussed to resolve the impasse over compensation. The Centre has claimed the support of 21 States on its proposal that States should borrow from the market to meet the compensation shortfalls from GST revenue.

Also read: GST Council meeting | Non-BJP States to oppose Centre’s borrowing option

The Centre has estimated a ₹2.35-lakh crore shortfall in cess collections used to recompense States, while compensation payments of ₹3 lakh crore are due this year. It has argued that only ₹97,000 crore of this shortfall can be attributed to GST implementation, while the rest is due to the unprecedented economic stress arising from the pandemic and the lockdowns.

Ten Opposition-ruled States, including Kerala, are yet to agree to the proposals which envision States raising ₹97,000 crore via a special borrowing window to be created by the central bank, or borrowing the entire ₹2.35 lakh crore shortfall in compensation cess collections from the market.

Also read: GST Council meeting debates revenue shortfall of states

Kerala Finance Minister T. M. Thomas Isaac said there can be no bifurcation of revenue shortfall for compensation purposes as due to pandemic and due to implementation of GST. “The entire shortfall needs to be compensated and it is the the constitutional right of the States. The compensation cannot be linked to normal borrowing or additional borrowing limits allowed to them,” he said.

Kerala, the first State to speak out against the Centre’s proposals, will stick to the stance that both the options infringe upon the above two cardinal principles and are not acceptable. “We would outright reject all notions that States refusing to make the choice will lose their GST compensation till 2022,” Dr. Isaac said.

Once the Centre accepts these two basic principles, the State is willing to discuss and arrive at a consensus regarding who borrows and in what proportion, what amount to be borrowed and what amounts need to be deferred to 2022. Extending the compensation cess levy from its original period of five years to facilitate repayments on borrowings can also be discussed.

There is a need to implement interim measures while the larger issues are discussed, as it is important that at least a part of the compensation to the States be paid immediately, given the shortfall in the revenues of the States and financial crunch, he said.

If there is no consensus in the GST Council on the negotiable issues, Dr. Isaac said the legal provisions for a Dispute Resolution Mechanism within the Council should be activated without delay. The long-standing demand of the States to appoint a Vice-Chairperson to the GST Council should be considered and implemented at the earliest, he urged.

The CAG audit report findings about the Centre incorrectly parking compensation cess collections in the Consolidated Fund of India, over the first two years of GST implementation, are also likely to be raised by some Opposition-ruled States.

The Kerala FM said the Central government’s approach has pushed the economy to the brink of disaster. “The actions cannot be viewed in isolation. There is significant erosion of trust. Circumstances point to a situation where the Centre’s actions are constricting the States’ resources and their financial autonomy,” he said.

In a review of the economy’s performance in September released on Sunday, the Ffinance Ministry said the Centre continues to lend unflinching support to State governments towards faster economic revival. “Despite the pandemic and the fall in the gross tax revenue to ₹5.04 lakh crore in the April-August period from as much as ₹6.6 lakh crore a year before, the tax devolution to States stood at ₹2.17 lakh crore in the first five months of this fiscal, compared with ₹2.55 lakh crore in the previous year,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ijhb03/article32499023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-GST1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gst-council-meeting-kerala-to-reject-two-alternatives-presented-by-union-government/article32766835.ece

Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has rolled out mobile reservation app ‘Ente KSRTC’ for hassle-free booking of seats in the long distance buses operated by it as part of improving the quality of services.

The app along with the logo of the ‘KSRTC Logistics,’ the exclusive division set up for transporting official letters, parcels of government departments, public sector units, constitutional institutions and private entrepreneurs, and that of the ‘KSRTC Janata Service,’ the unlimited ordinary service that stop anywhere on demand, will be launched on October 6 by Chief Minister Pinaryai Vijayan.

Although the KSRTC had an online reservation facility, the State transport undertaking did not have an exclusive mobile app for taking care of those reserving the seats through mobile phones. “This is being addressed through the rolling out of the Ente KSRTC. It will have all the latest payment facilities,” Transport Minister A. K. Saseendran said on Sunday.

The mobile app, developed in association with Abhi Bus, can be used on Android and iOS platforms, would come in handy for the long distance commuters. It can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.

The ‘KSRTC Janata Service’ for the unlimited ordinary service that stops anywhere on demand was selected from the 1,000-odd suggestions received from the commuters on the KSRTC’s official facebook page.

The service that commenced to overcome the low patronage due to the lockdown and the fear of using public transport has evoked good response, he said.

Edamalakkudy, the first tribal grama panchayat inside the Munnar forest division, has its isolation total now with landslips washing away the only road to the tribal hamlet from Pettimudy.

It is two months since the road was washed away in landslips that also disrupted power connection to the area. Landline and mobile connection too have snapped putting the 27 tribal settlements spread over a wide area in the forest out of connectivity.

With no road, the only option for Edamalakkudy residents was to walk the hilly stretch of 18 km from Pettimudy to Societykudy, the headquarters of all the settlements. Goods movement and online education of students in the tribal village was also still in limbo, according to sources.

A senior official of the KSEB said the power cable to Edamalakkudy, which was damaged in the landslips, was being set right and supply would be restored by the end of this week, he said.

Devikulam Sub Collector S. Prem Krishnan said repair work on one more kilometre of Edamalakkudy road needed to be done before setting the road link right. The Forest Department said they would complete the works within one week.

Yet the repair work was just a temporary solution, as the road was made of mud that would most likely be washed away in the next floods. Only a concrete or keeled road would ensure proper road connectivity, a Forest Department official said, adding if the government issued a special order, a proper road connectivity to Edamalakkudy could be made.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/edamalakkudy-in-total-isolation/article32766391.ece
170,2020/10/04,Protest against Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi's ‘denial’ of opportunity to dancer,"Sangeetha Nataka Akademi allegedly denied RLV Ramakrishnan chance to perform

Various political and cultural organisations on Sunday protested against the alleged denial of opportunity by the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi to dancer RLV Ramakrishnan for performing Mohiniyattam and his subsequent attempt to commit suicide.

RLV Ramakrishnan, dancer and brother of late actor Kalabhavan Mani, attempted suicide on Saturday evening allegedly after he was denied the opportunity to perform Mohiniyattam at an online programme organised by the akademi.

Action sought

BJP activists laid siege to akademi chairperson KPAC Lalitha’s house on Sunday. Alleging that the akademi denied opportunity to Mr. Ramakrishnan as he was a Dalit, BJP Thrissur district president K.K. Anish Kumar demanded action against akademi chairperson KPAC Lalitha and secretary N. Radhakrishnan Nair on charge of abetment to suicide. Action should be taken against both under the Scheduled Castes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. They should be removed from the posts, he demanded.

BJP State secretary A. Nagesh, who visited Ramakrishnan at the hospital, said it was an example of the ‘upper caste fascist stand’ of the CPI(M).

“The intellectual and cultural leaders, who often cry foul against atrocities against Dalit in BJP-ruled States, are silent on this issue. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should express his stand on the issue. The CPI(M) is trying to escape from the issue by making KPAC Lalitha a scapegoat,” he added. Kerala had become a State where atrocities against Dalits were high, he said.

‘Resignation sought’

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee secretary John Daniel alleged that the BJP and the CPI(M) were birds of the same feather in the case of Dalit atrocities. The incident in which a Dalit dancer was pushed to suicide was a blot on the image of the State. He demanded the resignation of KPAC Lalitha.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jxbryc/article32766331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05TVRLVRAMAKRISHNAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/protest-against-denial-of-opportunity-to-dancer/article32766297.ece

With the caseload at COVID-19 hospitals, first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) and second-line treatment centres (SLTCs) in Kollam showing a consistent spike, the district administration has announced emergency measures including clampdowns, inspections and enforcement drives.

While there has been an increased incidence of B and C category patients, positive cases have been reported from Kollam Corporation, four municipalities, and all the 68 panchayats in the district. At present 50% of positive cases in the district are kept in home care while 30% are in COVID-19 hospitals and the rest 20% have been moved to FLTCs and SLTCs.

The district administration has formed district- and taluk-level squads to strengthen surveillance and enforcement of COVID-19 protocol. The district-level squad includes Kollam Collector and District Police Chief, and District Medical Officer along with other officials. Taluk-level teams will be visiting all busy spots in the district to ensure that the guidelines are followed and they will submit the report to the district team.

All business outlets in the district including shops will be functioning only from 7 a,m. to 7 p.m. while restaurants can operate till 9 p.m. Since several cases have been reported from the coastal belt, some major harbours and auction halls in the district will remain closed till further notice.

The Health Department has issued new guidelines to various government offices in the district after many employees tested positive in recent days. If any staff member tests positive, office should be disinfected and closed for 24 hours. The primary and secondary contacts of the person should be traced and the swab of all high-risk and symptomatic persons in the list should be given for testing.

“They should remain in quarantine till the results are out. COVID-19 protocol and social distancing norms should be strictly followed when the office reopens,” said DMO Dr. R. Sreelatha.

The department has also opened a centre for monitoring patients in home care and providing treatment if they develop any issues. If a category A patient develops serious symptoms or there is a change in category, medical officer concerned in PHC/CHC can shift the person to the nearest COVID-19 hospital/FLTC/SLTC. “The centre attached to the COVID-19 first-line treatment centre functioning at Asramam hockey stadium has 10 beds with all emergency treatment provisions.

173,2020/10/04,UDF to resume protests against Kerala govt.,"Protesters will adhere to COVID-19 protocol: Hassan

The United Democratic Front (UDF) on Sunday flip-flopped on an earlier decision to suspend its agitation against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government given the worrying COVID-19 pandemic situation.

Congress leader M.M. Hassan, who took charge as UDF convener recently, clarified that Opposition activists would resume their public protests against the corruption and nepotism of the LDF government within the bounds prescribed by the pandemic prevention protocol.

Not more than five people would participate in a demonstration. The protesters would wear masks and observe the physical-distance norm.

On Oct. 12

The UDF would stage such pared-down protests against the government in 140 Assembly constituencies on October 12.

Congress leader K. Muraleedharan, MP, had on Thursday, questioned the decision of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) to suspend mass agitations against the government. He had said the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) was kept in the dark about the resolution. The settlement gave the impression that the Congress had developed cold feet and backed out of the fight. Top leaders were not consulted and the decision appeared arbitrary.

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had rejected Mr. Muraleedharan’s charge in their rejoinder later. They said the UDF partners had concurred with the decision.

Criticism from CM

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier criticised the Congress and the BJP for organising mass agitations that “imperilled” public health by “accelerating” the spread of the coronavirus. The BJP later stated that it would continue to protest against the government within the limit prescribed by the COVID-19 protocol.

Mr. Hassan told newspersons that the government had taken cover behind the pandemic to escape from being held accountable by the UDF.

‘CPI(M), BJP nexus’

The overlapping inquiries by Central agencies into the UAE consulate- linked gold smuggling case had exposed the secret nexus between the CPI(M) and BJP leaders.

Mr. Vijayan was beholden to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It could be one reason for the delay in prosecuting Mr. Vijayan in the SNC-Lavalin corruption case. The top leadership of the CPI(M) and the BJP were locked in a secret fraternal relationship, Mr. Hassan alleged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udf-to-resume-protests-against-govt/article32766260.ece
174,2020/10/04,Anger boils over at medical colleges across Kerala,"Faculty will boycott OP clinics from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. today

Faculty in all Government Medical College Hospitals (MCHs) across the State have decided to continue their agitation against the suspension of one of their senior colleagues in Thiruvananthapuram and will boycott OP clinics from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Monday.

Faculty, who have the additional duty as COVID Nodal Officers at all MCHs, will also relinquish this charge as a mark of protest against the government action.

Doctors and nurses in Thiruvananthapuram MCH have been on the path of agitation since Friday after the government issued orders suspending the COVID Nodal Officer and two head nurses for the alleged negligence in the care of an elderly patient.

The patient, who had been discharged after treatment in the COVID ward, had been later found by the family to have maggot-infested bedsores all over his back.

Medical fraternity had pointed out that the unfortunate incident had occurred because of the acute shortage of support staff in the hospital, about which the government had been informed time and again.

Indefinite boycott planned

The joint action council led by Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association (KGMCTA) and other professional organisations have decided to indefinitely boycott OP duties from Tuesday and to stop all online classes if the government does not revoke the suspension order and take necessary steps to improve the acute shortage of support staff at the MCH.

Health-care workers who have been relentlessly working on the front lines for COVID-19 management should not be made scapegoats to cover up the government’s failure to resolve systemic and administrative issues inside the hospital, KGMCTA leaders said here.

The 48-hour relay hunger fast launched by KGMCTA at Thiruvananthapuram MCH to protest against the treatment meted out to their colleague will end on Monday morning.

Meanwhile, nurses too have launched an indefinite relay hunger strike here demanding that the government revoke the suspension of their colleagues.

The government, meanwhile, has drawn flak for demoralising health-care workers, who have been functioning under tremendous stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of the risks posed to them and their families.

S.S. Lal, a public health professional, pointed out that the MCH, with over 700 COVID-19 patients and over 850 non-COVID-19 patients, would need to invest heavily in human resources to care for all these patients as per the COVID protocol. More wards and ICUs are opened up to accommodate more patients, regardless of the fact that there are not enough nursing or support staff to care for all patients.

Shashi Tharoor, MP, has also come out in support of doctors and said that “our brave medics needed our understanding, sympathy and support”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/article22273797.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TV-MEDICALCOLLEGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/anger-boils-over-at-medical-colleges-across-state/article32766224.ece
175,2020/10/04,474 cases in Kottayam,"The number of fresh COVID-19 cases in Kottayam continued to rise sharply with 474 persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Sunday.

Of this, 470 persons including four health care workers contracted the virus through local transmission. Kottayam municipality led the tally with 46 cases while Vazhappally panchayat followed closely with 43 cases. High number of cases were also reported from Erattupetta-35, Parathodu-22, Erumely-21 and Arppookkara-19.

With 320 recoveries during the day, the district currently has 4,979 active cases.

Meanwhile, District Collector M. Anjana has issued an order entrusting the heads of various departments as sector and monitoring officers for the COVID-19 prevention activities at the local body level. The order, invoking provisions of the Disaster Management Act, takes a cue from the government order that the service of officials from departments other than Health, Revenue, police and local government could be utilised for COVID-19 prevention activities.

In the first phase, as many as 94 gazetted rank officers have been deployed, who will work on behalf of the District Disaster Management Authority and report directly to the District Collector.

176,2020/10/04,IIIT-Kottayam has its own learning platform,"OSOC-P uses open-source tools and is capable of handling multiple requests at the same time

In August when the academic year took off at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kottayam, (IIIT-Kottayam), the institute saw an open-source future for learning.

The unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak had already forced the education sector to embrace technology. But in the absence of robust connectivity, questions on the efficacy of remote learning continued to linger.

So, instead of the usual re-purposing of the work-based platforms such as Zoom or Google Meet, the Centrally funded institution opted to build a customised application using Moodle plugins — OSOC-P — that supports the rich ecosystem of classroom learning.

This new learning management system, developed with the active support of its faculty members and technical support staff, is now reaping rich dividends to the institution, besides bringing in laurels from even the Union Ministry of Education.

“IIIT-Kottayam has innovated an #OpenSourcePlatform for the Teaching & Learning Process (OSOC-P). The platform is capable of delivering online classes & conducts all virtual activities like online classes, content sharing, etc. for registered users. Great work team!”, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Union Minister of Education, recently wrote on his official social media page.

According to M. Radhakrishnan, Registrar, IIIT-Kotttayam, the platform is capable of handling requests by multiple students and faculty members at the same time. It can also be used for organising virtual programming labs under which students are directly provided a code editor to write their program and it will be passed towards multiple test cases.

“Each course maintains a separate dashboard containing its own announcements and lecture notes and is connected to an own meeting room. The faculty members can pose questions to the class through polls and take attendance while the sessions can be recorded and students can access those recordings till the end of that course,” Ebin Deni Raj, a faculty member of CSE Department explained.

Online exams

It also enables the conduct of online examinations through multiple-choice questions and students can scan and upload the answer scripts as a single document. Plagiarised content is flagged instantly .The grade for assignments and the report for courses too can be generated through the platform.

“Since the faculty members can regulate the volume of data transmission by reducing the video resolution, the system works efficiently even in case of a fall in Internet speed,” added Dr. Radhakrishnan.

Having achieved cent percent attendance of students — a rare feat in the age of online learning, IIIT-Kottayam now seeks to help other institutions in the region to adapt to virtual learning by designing and sharing similar customised open-source platforms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hrw8no/article32767008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tv-Online-learningcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iiit-kottayam-has-its-own-learning-platform/article32766126.ece

The victims were identified as a 74-year-old Kadambanad native who had died at the Pathanamthitta District hospital three days ago and a 75-year-old Chittar native who died on October 4.

178,2020/10/04,Double whammy for Alappuzha,"Amid the ongoing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, reporting of dengue fever and leptospirosis diseases from different parts of the district has become a cause for concern.

According to the Health Department, at least five confirmed dengue fever cases and three confirmed leptospirosis cases were reported from the district in the last six days. The dengue cases were logged from Pallippuram, Vayalar, Thanneermukkom, Cherthala and Champakulam, while Nelamperoor, Panavally and Alappuzha registered one leptospirosis case each. The district also witnessed two suspected leptospirosis deaths during this period.

Although the situation is nowhere near spiralling out of control, the diseases are threatening to pile more pressure on a severely strained health machinery in the district.

In 2019, Alappuzha logged 355 dengue cases including one death and 188 leptospirosis cases with four deaths. This year, around 200 dengue and 100 leptospirosis cases have been reported so far. “Regarding dengue fever and leptospirosis cases, there is nothing unusual this year as it follows the same pattern as in the previous years. As a waterlogged place, the district is vulnerable to diseases like leptospirosis. The only difference this time is that a large part of the health machinery is involved in fighting the pandemic. We are short-staffed and this has an impact on other activities of the Health Department,” said a Health Department official.

Officials said that the department had strengthened surveillance in affected areas utilising the available resources.

As leptospirosis is spread through the urine of infected animals, officials have urged the people involved in jobs, which make them contact with stagnant water to ensure personal protection. They added that those vulnerable to the disease could take preventive medicines.

Dengue fever is caused by the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. According to experts, keeping possible mosquito breeding grounds clean and avoiding mosquito bite can prevent contracting the disease.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/double-whammy-for-alappuzha/article32766049.ece
179,2020/10/04,Avoid visiting Corpn. office till Oct. 30: Mayor,"Mayor appeals to public as many councillors and staff test positive for virus

City Corporation Mayor K.Sreekumar has requested the public to avoid visiting the Corporation office until October 30, except in unavoidable circumstances, in light of the increase in spread of COVID-19 in the city.

He said that the public can depend on the Mayor's complaint redressal cell (whatsapp no-8590036770, e-mail - complaints. tmc@ gmail.com ).

As on Sunday, seven councillors of the Corporation, including the Deputy Mayor, have tested positive for the virus. In addition, 12 other employees have also tested positive. Mr.Sreekumar said that this is not an alarming situation, as this is just one percent of the Corporation's total employee strength. It showed the success of the plan with which the Corporation has gone about its COVID-19 prevention activities.

The Corporation workers have been involved in disinfection activities, in the burial of bodies of those who died due to COVID-19, in running community kitchens and in ensuring strict quarantine, along with all its regular work. Still, only 53 of the employees and councillors, who were all involved in these activities, have tested positive, said the Mayor.

As the last date for tax payment and for renewal of various licenses was on September 30, the Corporation office had witnessed a major rush last week.

Although more staff were deployed to reduce the rush at the counters, the large crowd that still gathered might have led to two of the employees of the Corporation's main office testing positive. All those who have come into contact with them have gone into quarantine. Alternative arrangements have been made to ensure the smooth running of all sections, said the Mayor.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/avoid-visiting-corpn-office-till-oct-30-mayor/article32765720.ece

Responding to a petition by Thomas Chazhikadan, MP, seeking to convene a high-level review meeting to assess the progress of railway development works in his constituency, Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said that focus would be on expediting these works.

In his petition, the MP pointed out that work moved at a snail’s pace in the 17-kilometres stretch while the proposed renovation of the Kottayam Railway Station and the proposed second entrance to the station near the goods shed too lagged much behind the schedule.

The Central government already allotted ₹20 crore to renovate the station here, which would be flaunting a touch of indigenous Kerala design on completion of the works. The project also envisaged developing the circulation area, besides renovating the pilgrim shelter.

The petition further demanded that the construction of bridges across the Meenachil and Kodoor rivers at Kottayam, Muttambalam subway and the ROB at rubber board be completed in a time-bound manner.

According to the MP, the delay in construction of ROBs at Chottanikkara Road, Mulanthuruthi, Kaduthuruthy, Kuruppanthara, Manjur, Kothanallur, Carithas, Kottayam P&T Quarters and Pakil had been causing severe inconvenience to the public.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/railways-to-expedite-track-doubling-in-kottayam/article32765607.ece

The government intends to provide higher education in different streams to all sections of society through Sree Narayana Guru Open University, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday.

“This is a platform to make higher education accessible to all skilled, eligible, and desirous persons,” he added, inaugurating Kerala’s first open university named after the social reformer through videoconferencing.

Pointing out that modern Kerala was indebted to Sree Narayana Guru, he said the changes brought about by Guru were not limited to any particular community, but benefited an entire spectrum of people.

Observing that Guru always exhorted others to gain knowledge, the Chief Minister said the university was an extension of that thought.

“No education system can sustain without focusing on agriculture, industry, vocational skills and technology that form the backbone of our economy,” he added.

Headquarters

Apart from conventional courses, the university will also offer skill development programmes. Chooravilas Complex near the Kollam bypass will be the temporary headquarters of the university.

The seven-storey building has 18 classrooms, an auditorium that can accommodate 800 persons and ample parking facility.

Showing no signs of abatement, the COVID-19 case graph in Thiruvananthapuram continued to grow at an alarming rate with 1,049 people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Saturday. The number of active cases also rose to 12,361, further pushing the health care capabilities of the district to its limits.

184,2020/10/04,Meppadi to have fully automated water distribution system,"Digital water supply to enable users to request water on demand

Meppadi grama panchayat in Wayanad district is gearing up to establish a fully automated public water distribution system.

The project is being executed with technical support from Asian Soft MC Grade InfoTech Private Limited, a Mangaluru-based software firm.

The panchayat has been supplying drinking water to around 600 beneficiaries from a perennial source on a nearby hill using gravitational force, said K.K. Sahad, president, Meppadi grama panchayat. “However, we have been incurring huge financial loss every month owing to water leakage, recurring maintenance coast, over-usage of water due to dearth of proper a measuring system. Incidentally, the firm approached us with their innovative technology called ‘Digital Water Supply’,” he added.

Digital Water Supply was developed by the firm to address shortcomings in the public water supply system and to save water in this era of increasing water scarcity, said Mohammed Munazil, managing director, Asian Soft MC Grade InfoTech. He added that the system helps in accurate assessment of leakage, overuse, delivery time, availability of operator, and inappropriate billing.

Through the web application, users will be able to change the existing drinking water scheme to a fully automated system and request water on demand as well as disconnect if they do not need water for a few days.

The system is designed in such a way that the service provider can efficiently collect water tax both online and offline, and the provider can block connections after a certain period of time if anyone fails to pay tax. That way, bill collection can be streamlined, making drinking water supply profitable.

The project will be completed at a cost of ₹58 lakh in six months, and one year free maintenance service will be offered by the firm, Mr. Sahad said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/meppadi-to-have-fully-automated-water-distribution-system/article32763355.ece

186,2020/10/04,Prohibitory orders take effect in capital,"‘Unnecessary crowding not permitted’

Bolstering efforts to contain the pandemic, prohibitory orders came into effect in the capital district on Saturday. The district administration focussed on sensitising the public on the first day of the curbs on Saturday.

The City police initiated legal action against the doctors of the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, who agitated against the government’s decision to suspend a doctor and two nurses for alleged negligence in tending to a patient. Around 50 identifiable doctors have been charged by the Medical College police under charges pertaining to unlawful assembly and violation of the prohibitory orders clamped under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

Resembling scenes reminiscent of the total lockdown, the district witnessed a sizeable police deployment in various parts of the district. Police personnel were stationed at shopping areas and major junctions. The district administration had a day ago chalked out specific plans for the Thiruvananthapuram City and Rural police districts to focus on areas that usually witnessed heavy rush.

Besides, the imposition of the restrictions also evidently brought about a visible change in the functioning of commercial outlets. Many shops adopted steps to streamline customer inflow and ensure thermal screening at entry points.

Clear directions

Referring to the confusion over the prohibitory orders, District Collector Navjot Khosa told the media that clearly defined directions had been laid down for the containment and non-containment zones. While tight restrictions have come into effect in containment zones, heightened alert also prevailed in other areas mainly owing to the failure in ensuring social distancing.

While public life will not be affected by way of the restrictions, unnecessary crowding will not be permitted. Gathering of over five people will not be permitted in public places, but the norm shall not apply inside commercial outlets and offices. Up to 20 people will be allowed inside shops depending on the area, Dr. Khosa said.

She added that Gazetted officers will be designated as executive magistrates in various places as part of enforcing the restrictions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/prohibitory-orders-take-effect-in-capital/article32762964.ece
187,2020/10/04,Housing projects pose threat to Suchindram Theroor Bird Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu,"Real estate sharks are converting Kanniyakumari wetlands into housing plots.

Lush, green paddy fields interspersed with banana and coconut groves stretch endlessly from one side of Parakkai Kulam, Kooni Kulam and Suchindram Kulam in Kanniyakumari district. They offer a habitat for native and migratory birds around the protected zone of the Suchindram Theroor Bird Sanctuary. However, with real estate sharks in the process of converting some wetlands into housing plots, the bird habitat has come under threat.

If the development goes unchecked, not only the sanctuary but also the people in nearby habitations will suffer as on the bed of Parakkai Kulam and Kooni Kulam lie innumerable borewells dug by the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) for supplying drinking water to the neighbouring villages.

C. Kosalai, president of Parakkai Panchayat, has woken up to the threat posed by real estate sharks. “I recently set out to prevent the owner of a wetland from creating a pathway to an area he had proposed to convert into housing plots,” she said.

“He denied having any such plans. But he had already divided the land into plots and sold them to a few individuals,” said Ms. Kosalai, who has put up boards on wetlands stating that land use conversion would not be permitted by the panchayat.

“I have been resisting the real estate lobby,” she added.

She pointed out that as early as in 2010, then Kanniyakumar Collector Rajendra Ratnoo had, following the depletion of the groundwater table due to indiscriminate conversion of wetlands for housing projects, issued an order directing the village administrative officers (VAOs) not to grant permission for construction activities on wetlands.

But the order has seldom been followed. Already, the paddy fields irrigated by Putheri Kulam have become concrete patches.

“I have refused to sell my fields to the real estate lobby. They have surrounded my paddy fields with constructions, and have even been preventing water from flowing into my fields,” said Satha Sakthi, a native of Putheri. His efforts had previously led to the removal of the local panchayat president and vice-president for granting permission for housing plots.

In Parakkai, a 20-foot road divides the waterbody and the paddy fields, and behind the area marked for real estate development runs a canal carrying water to the fields for irrigation.

“The first casualty will be the canal. It will be polluted by the residents if housing permission is granted,” Ms. Kosalai said.

The real estate lobby circumvents the Collector’s order using a time-tested method. First, they will cultivate plantain and coconut in the paddy field. In two years, they will remove the banana crop and nurture the coconut. Later, the area will be levelled for a housing layout.

“But you have to get permission even to change the crop in Kanniyakumari district, as the purpose of changing the crop is to create housing plots,” said Lal Mohan, convener, Nagercoil chapter of the Indian National Trust for Culture and Heritage, who has been fighting similar issues in the district legally.

Ornithologist Rober Grubh said the conversion of wetlands into housing plots would have a heavy bearing on birds’ habitat.

“All the wading birds in the waterbodies go outside to feed and come back. Not just the sanctuary, but the areas around it should also be protected,” Mr. Grubh said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xntux8/article32767614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04OCTTHWETLANDS-PATCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/housing-projects-pose-threat-to-suchindram-theroor-bird-sanctuary-in-tamil-nadus-kanniyakumari-district/article32767615.ece

189,2020/10/04,Kanimozhi to lead candle-light march to Raj Bhavan seeking justice for Hathras victim,"Mr. Stalin on Sunday said Ms. Kanimozhi will lead the protest march.

The DMK’s women’s wing led by its secretary Kanimozhi will take out a protest march on Monday evening to the Raj Bhavan seeking justice for the Hathras rape victim and to urge the Uttar Pradesh government to protect women, minorities, scheduled tribes whose safety has been a question mark in that State, DMK president M.K. Stalin said.

Mr. Stalin on Sunday said Ms. Kanimozhi will lead the protest march from the Rajiv Gandhi statue at Guindy to the Raj Bhavan at 5.30 p.m. on October 5.

He alleged that the U.P. government was trying to protect the accused and was creating a situation to help them escape from the law.

“The incident has created ripples not only in Uttar Pradesh but also across India. The police also stopped Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi who tried to go and meet the victim's family. What’s more atrocious is that the police manhandled Mr. Rahul Gandhi and the visuals of him being pushed to the ground is a blot on India’s democracy. If such treatment is being meted out to Mr. Rahul himself, imagine what would be the situation of the common man,” Mr. Stalin said.

He demanded that the U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath take responsibility for not providing enough security to Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi when they were allowed to go and meet the family on Saturday.

“Claiming to control the Congress cadre, the U.P. police used force against Ms. Priyanka Gandhi. All these are being done to frighten the people. Democratic rights and human rights have been thrown to the winds. The Chief Minister should take responsibility for all this and the Union Home Minister Amit Shah must give an explanation,” he demanded.

The cases against both the Congress leaders must be withdrawn and the privileges committee of Parliament must investigate the insult meted out to Mr. Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Stalin said.

“Minorities, women, scheduled tribes do not have security in Uttar Pradesh. Media are also understanding the situation there. The Central government has the responsibility to understand this and set the situation right,” Mr. Stalin said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/r2crz0/article32765401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kanimozhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kanimozhi-to-lead-candle-light-march-to-raj-bhavan-seeking-justice-for-hathras-victim/article32765402.ece
190,2020/10/04,Oussudu bird sanctuary to get a facelift,"With the migratory bird season all set to begin, the Tamil Nadu Forest Department has started upgradation of infrastructure at the Oussudu bird sanctuary in Poothurai to attract more visitors to the district’s primary eco-sensitive region.

Located between the Pulicat and Point Calimere wetlands, the Oussudu lake is identified as a wetland of national importance under the National Wetland Conservation Programme of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), and has also been declared as one of the 93 significant wetlands in Asia by the Asian Wetland Bureau.

The inter-state lake covers an expanse of 800 hectares, of which over 400 hectares lies in Villupuram district. The Forest Department has sent a proposal for developing the bird sanctuary to add value and ensure that it becomes a centre for learning about migratory birds.

“We have proposed basic infrastructural facilities including fencing around the lake, bird interpretation centre, watch towers and other protection activities at a cost of ₹2 crore.

The works will be taken up under a centrally sponsored scheme with a 60:40 split between Central and State funding. The works will begin after the government accords sanction,” said District Forest Officer Abhishek Tomar.

The bird interpretation centre will cater to wildlife enthusiasts, environmentalists, tourists and students. It would provide comprehensive information on the flora and fauna of the Oussudu lake especially migratory birds.

The department has also proposed nature and bird trails and wildlife enthusiasts and researchers can witness the birds in their natural habitat, Mr. Tomar said. The interpretation centre will also have exhibits on birds that show the path each migratory birds takes before stopping at the Oussudu lake.

Instances of poaching have also come down on the Villupuram side thanks to strict enforcement and the department has deployed five Anti-Poaching Watchers (APW) to prevent poaching of migratory birds, Mr. Tomar said.

According to K. Raman of Indigenous Biodiversity Foundation (IBF), a non-profit organisation, “As many as 66 species of birds belonging to 47 families were coming in large numbers and stay in the sanctuary for few months from October every year.” The critically endangered Spoon-billed sandpiper and endangered White-bellied sea eagle were also sighted, he said.

Flamingoes, Oriental Darter, Spot-billed pelican, Great White Pelican, Painted Stork, Eurasian Spoon Bill and Pallid Harrier are frequent visitors to the lake. Another regular is the Grey-breasted Prinia, while one of the species that arrives in flocks is the Common Coot.

Bird watching camps are organised here every year and the development of bird sanctuary is expected to boost the tourism potential here, Mr. Tomar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/j11qy0/article32765316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Grey-headed-Swamp-Hen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/oussudu-bird-sanctuary-to-get-a-facelift/article32765317.ece
191,2020/10/04,CCTV footage exposes man's fake abduction claim,"A 56-year-old driver, Henry alias Hariharan, who claimed to have been abducted “at gun point” by “Hindi-speaking” men on Friday morning, returned home on Saturday night only to eventually admit that he had left home owing to debts.

The police said that the man, who was the driver for a BJP functionary, came back to Sattur on Saturday night.

He initially claimed that he was bundled into a car and gun-totting men speaking Hindi, took him to Madurai. After getting him meals, they blind-folded him and took him some 100 miles away to a farm in an unidentified place that looked like Theni district.

“They threatened me with dire consequences that I should not be working against the BJP. They also said that they need to teach a lesson to two more persons who were against the party,” he told the police.

The man claimed that he was later dropped in the district.

However, by this time, the Sattur town police had registered a case of abduction. A team led by the Sattur Deputy Superintendent of Police, S. Ramakrishnan, formed special teams to track down the “abducted” person.

Ten Inspectors of Police and 200 men had fanned out across the district and to the neighbouring districts to investigate the case.

“Had we not got five video footages that showed this man boarding one bus after another at five different places in Sattur town and Virudhunagar, we would have been left with no option but to believe in his words,” the DSP said.

After the police revealed that they had the video footages, the man spilled the beans stating that he left home owing to family problems, including debts.

192,2020/10/04,Virudhunagar farmers encouraged to produce certified seeds for vegetables,"It’s a profitable venture; subsidies given for various components

For the first time, Department of Horticulture is providing subsidies on various components for farmers interested in producing certified seeds for various vegetables.

The department has fixed a target of covering 16.4 hectare of land to produce 7.631 tonnes of certified seeds for onion, drumstick, cluster beans, bitter gourd, snake gourd, ridged gourd, pumpkin and greens, Virudhunagar Collector, R. Kannan, said in a statement.

“In Virudhunagar district, we are promoting certified seed production for cluster beans, onion, pumpkin and ridged gourd,” said Assistant Director (Horticulture), Srivilliputtur, N. Rajasekaran.

Farmers as entrepreneurs

Certified seeds for vegetables are not adequately available in stock with the Department of Horticulture unlike seeds for paddy. “As of now, the vegetable farmers are dependent on private companies for seeds.

To promote increasing the coverage of vegetable cultivation, the State Government has come up with a scheme to make vegetable farmers entrepreneurs and encourage them to produce certified seeds,” he added.

Farmers, who have assured irrigation facility, need to register themselves with the Department of Seed Certification to produce certified seeds. “The registration fee of Rs. 400 is given as subsidy to the farmers under the scheme,” he added. They need to buy foundation seeds from the department.

Subsidy

The farmers would be given 30% subsidy up to a maximum of Rs. 1,200 for integrated nutrient management and integrated pesticide management.

The farmers will also be subsidy for around Rs. 1.13 lakh for providing drip irrigation facility (differs from crop to crop) and 50% subsidy to a maximum of Rs. 2 lakh for setting up shade net house and 50% subsidy for setting up pack houses.

Officials from the Department of Seed Certification will inspect the field at the initial stage, flowering stage and harvesting stage. “After testing the seeds, they would certify them. Farmers can sell the certified seeds to private companies, other farmers and also to the Department of Horticulture.

Profitable venture

“The seeds of different crops would fetch Rs. 200 a kg to Rs. 2,000 a kg. This will be highly profitable for the farmers,” Mr. Rajasekaran, added.

Farmers can get further details from the office of Deputy Director (Horticulture) – 04562-252393.

Police said that following complaints that the DMK cadre and functionaries organised ""gram sabha"" meetings on Oct 2, despite the curfew, cases were registered.

The government had originally announced the conduct of gram sabha meetings on Oct 2 (Gandhi Jayanthi) across the State. However, after the DMK president M.K. Stalin appealed to the panchayat presidents and the people to pass resolutions against the recently passed farm laws by the Union government, the State government cancelled the conduct of the meetings.

Officials claimed that the government had cancelled as a precautionary measure in view of the covid-19 virus. Under such circumstances, the DMK cadre conducted the meetings in many districts on October 2, which came under the police scanner.

194,2020/10/04,"Only Pocso courts can hear anticipatory bail pleas, says HC","‘Sessions Court cannot entertain such applications’

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has ruled that the Special courts designated under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act alone are empowered to entertain anticipatory bail petitions in respect of offences under the Act. The Sessions Court cannot entertain such applications, the court said.

The court was responding to the Karur District Judge who had sought a clarification with regard to the jurisdiction of the District and Sessions Court in entertaining anticipatory bail applications for the offences committed under the Pocso Act.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and V. Bharathidasan observed that even in cases where pre-arrest bail was sought before the First Information Report (FIR) was registered, only the Special Court designated under the Pocso Act can entertain the application.

Mahila Courts

As per a government order issued in 2013, the State government, in consultation with the High Court, designated the Fast Track Mahila Courts as Special Courts under the Pocso Act and Additional Sessions Judges presiding over the Fast Track Mahila Courts were functioning as the judges in Special Courts under the Act.

Section 28(1) of the Pocso Act states that a court of session already in existence in a district can be designated as a Special Court to try offences under the Act. Under section 33(1) of the Act, the Special Court may take cognisance of any offence, without the accused being committed to it for trial, upon receiving a complaint or a police report.

Section 33(9) of the Act states that the Special Court shall have all the powers of a court of session and shall try offences under the Act. In such circumstances it has to be treated as a court of original jurisdiction and it has all the powers of the court of original criminal jurisdiction.

Under Section 31 of the Act it is clear that the provisions including bails and bonds shall apply to the proceedings before the Special Court. Therefore the provision of anticipatory bail is applicable to the Special Court. The Special Court is exclusively empowered to deal with the offences under the Pocso Act, the judges said. The object of the Act is to provide protection to children from offences of sexual assault, harassment and pornography and safeguard the interest and well being of the child at every stage of judicial process, the judges said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/p9yqi9/article32763418.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04MADURAIHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/only-pocso-courts-can-hear-anticipatory-bail-pleas-says-hc/article32763419.ece
195,2020/10/04,Cameras installed in Kallar corridor to monitor jumbos,"The number of animals using the corridor and the difficulties they face will be assessed

The Forest Department has installed cameras to monitor elephants in five locations on the busy Mettupalayam-Udhagamandalam road where the ghat section of the National Highway-67 passes through the ecologically important Kallar elephant corridor.

The joint initiative by the Forest Department and WWF-India is to assess the number of elephants using the corridor, its functionality, seasonal movements and the difficulties elephants face. Though lone tuskers are found to have been crossing the road without much difficulty, vehicular movement to and from the Nilgiris through Coonoor remains a major obstruction for herds comprising calves.

“The cameras were placed for increased monitoring of elephants using the corridor. We are expecting to collect various data, including the number of herds using the corridor, the time they take to cross the road, changes in the patterns of movement and other difficulties the animals face,” said I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle.

According to the studies done by researchers in the past, the Kallar corridor is significant as it connects the Brahmagiri-Nilgiris-Eastern Ghats elephant population range with the Nilambur-Silent Valley-Coimbatore population range. The movement of elephants between the two ranges facilitates genetic exchange, dispersal and access to a variety of seasonal foraging grounds, according to researchers.

Furthermore, researchers have assessed that the corridor is the only possible transit route for large mammals to move between the forests of the Silent Valley National Park-Mannarkad-Palakkad Forest Divisions and the Nilgiri North Forest Division-Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.

“Traffic intensity, over 8,000 vehicles per day, on the NH passing through the elephant corridor is the biggest problem. The changes in the use of private lands in the corridor... such as fallow lands developed into banana plantations and electric fencing for them, have further narrowed the elephant passage. The green tax toll booth set up on the corridor needs to be relocated to help in the smooth movement of elephants,” said D. Boominathan, landscape coordinator of WWF-India, Coimbatore.

Various Departments and stakeholders put forward a proposal for a 1.6-km flyover from the Kallar bridge to the second hairpin bend of the ghat section at a cost of ₹160 crore a few years ago. But it did not get budgetary sanction from the State government, said officials.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3go9lq/article32763415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04ELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cameras-installed-in-kallar-corridor-to-monitor-jumbos/article32763416.ece
196,2020/10/04,Anna varsity to start hiring for 250 positions,"There was a ban on recruitment

Anna University has announced recruitment for positions of faculty and other academic staff at its four campuses. This comes almost three years after the State government announced a ban on recruitment by universities to accommodate excess employees from Annamalai University in 2017.

Despite protests, the government had insisted that even faculty from the erstwhile private institution would be posted at other government institutions, as it had been taken over by the government. Two faculty — one each for the chemical engineering and civil engineering departments — were posted from the Annamalai University, besides eight non-teaching staff, at the Anna University. Vacancies at the university began to swell. It now has over 300 vacant posts. Students were being taught by teaching fellows and teachers hired on a temporary basis.

Ban lifted

On October 30, 2019, the government lifted the ban on recruitment, paving way for filling the vacancies.

Earlier this year, the finance committee of the university approved the recruitment of around 245 persons, including for the position of librarians. There could be as many as 70 vacancies for professors, for which a notification has not been issued, university sources said. “It is good that we want to achieve 50% gross enrolment ratio and that we have pockets of excellence as well. Equality does not bring excellence in education. It ultimately affects the quality of the teaching and learning process,” a senior professor said.

Online registration commenced on September 30, and the last date for filing online applications is October 21.

A physician and a specialist in chest diseases, asthma and allergies, Prof. Thiruvengadam, who is fondly known as Prof. KVT, is widely known for his teaching, clinical acumen and patient-centric approach. He graduated from the Government Stanley Medical College (SMC) in 1950. He served as a professor of medicine in SMC and Madras Medical College. Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, in a press release, said he was a teacher for nearly 31 years and moulded several students into good doctors. He underwent training in chest diseases abroad.

He was the recipient of prestigious awards. He received Padma Shri for his contribution to the field of medicine and the Dr. B.C. Roy Award.

‘Teacher of teachers’

Many of his students recalled their association with the “master physician”. A student of SMC from 1964 to 1974 (MBBS and MD), Dr. Devarajan said Prof. KVT was a teacher of teachers, very kind, polite, soft-spoken and considerate towards the poor. “He has taught thousands of medical students. He was an excellent clinician and academic, his diagnosis of patients was great and he used to spend nearly an hour for a patient. He mastered both medicine and English literature,” he said. When Dr. Devarajan wrote a textbook of medicine recently, it was Prof. KVT who penned the foreword.

He always laid emphasis on history-taking of patients, said M.A.C.S. Rajendran, general surgeon. “He used to tell us that history-taking would take you to diagnosis and clinical examination would complete the diagnosis. He always insisted that we patiently listen to what a patient is saying, allow him/her to talk,” he said. A student of the 1957-batch of SMC, he recalled the “bedside clinics” during Prof. KVT’s ward rounds. “He used to stop at the bedside of all patients and discuss their condition. If a patient had a heart problem, he used to teach us the heart murmurs and do a clinical examination. These clinics were an integral part of teaching in the wards,” he recounted.

R. Surendran, former director, Institute of Surgical Gastroenterology, SMC, said, “He always gave importance to research in medicine. During my MBBS days (1969 batch), we had two textbooks of medicine, and he was so knowledgeable that we used to say that Prof. KVT was equal to Price’s Textbook of Medicine, plus Harrison’s Textbook of Medicine.”

According to Subramanian Srinivasan, a consultant in infectious diseases, Prof. KVT was a larger than life figure in the medical careers of many of his students at SMC and Madras Medical College. “I was fortunate to have been a student in the early 70s. It is refreshing to have grown with him, to listen and examine the patient, to arrive at a diagnosis and to learn the methods used at bedside... This is in contrast to the current medical practice where there is too much reliance on diagnostic techniques. We have lost a great teacher and a clinician. He will be missed by his patients and students, and his loss is irreplaceable,” he said.

Dr. Thiruvengadam’s wife Dr. Malathi passed away recently. He is survived by his two sons and a daughter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/d1nbpa/article32763406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th04doc,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/renowned-physician-kv-thiruvengadam-is-no-more/article32763407.ece
199,2020/10/04,Plea filed in HC seeking GST compensation for State,"PIL asks for the release of ₹12,250-crore shortfall in collections accrued this year

A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the Union Ministry of Finance to implement Section 7 of the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act of 2017 in letter and spirit, and consequently release ₹12,250 crore to Tamil Nadu towards compensation for shortfall in GST collections from April 1 to August 31.

Activist G. Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal has filed the case through his counsel M. Radhakrishnan. He contended that the failure of the Centre to comply with the statutory requirement and release the money, to compensate the shortftall in GST collections in the State, would amount to violation of the fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.

He pointed out that GST was introduced in the country through the Constitution (one hundred and first Amendment) Act of 2016 and Section 18 of that Act stated that the Parliament would, by law, on the recommendation of the GST Council, provide for compensation to the States for loss of revenue, for a period of five years, on account of implementation of GST.

It was in view of such a guarantee, the 2017 Act was notified by the Centre on July 1, 2017. As per Section 7 of this Act, the compensation payable to the States should be calculated provisionally and released to them at the end of every two months. The quantum should also be calculated for every financial year, after the receipt of final revenue figures, and settled.

However, the Centre had not paid the compensation to Tamil Nadu since April, he said and referred to a letter written by the Chief Minister to the Prime Minister last month. The contents of the letter were released to the media on August 31 and it was stated therein that Tamil Nadu had agreed to the implementation of GST only on assurance of compensation for any loss of revenue.

“It is also released from the press release dated August 31 that a total sum of ₹12,250 crore is due to Tamil Nadu as compensation for the shortfall in GST collections of which ₹11,459.37 crore has accrued from April to July,” the petitioner said and sought for a direction to the Centre to release the amount forthwith.

Further contending that he had all the locus standi to file the present PIL petition, the litigant said he had filed the case to discharge his fundamental duty, under Article 51A(j) of the Constitution, to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation could constantly rise to higher levels of endeavour and achievement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/plea-filed-in-hc-seeking-gst-compensation-for-state/article32763405.ece
200,2020/10/04,Duraimurugan expresses regret over remarks,"No disrespect meant, says DMK leader

DMK general secretary Duraimurugan on Saturday expressed regret over the remarks which had offended the alliance partners of the party.

“Since I was wearing a mask some words would have been wrongly uttered and a section of the media had reported that I addressed the alliance partners in a disparaging manner. I did not say anything disrespectfully. Even assuming that I had uttered those words, I am extremely sorry,” Mr. Duraimurugan said in a statement.

While addressing the media on Friday after participating in the gram sabha meeting, Mr. Duraimurugan reportedly said, “Who will be with us and who will not be with us will be known only after withdrawal of nomination (Yevan iruppan Yevan Povan).”

He clarified that all he meant was that nothing could be concretely said about the alliance.

“During election time changes can take place at the last moment. Those who are with us may go somewhere and some new parties may join us. It has happened in the past,” Mr. Duraimurugan recalled his speech in the statement.

He said after becoming the general secretary he had changed his style of functioning and speech. “If I anyone feels offended by my speech I express regret,” he said.

Mr. Duraimurugan said he had respect for all political leaders and those who knew him would understand his speech. “I will ensure that it will not recur in the future,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/786ina/article32763398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04DURAIMURUGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/duraimurugan-expresses-regret-over-remarks/article32763399.ece
201,2020/10/04,Court rejects Sivasankaran’s plea against notice,"The businessman is under investigation for causing a loss of over ₹600 crore to IDBI Bank

The Madras High Court has refused to entertain a writ appeal preferred against a look out circular (LOC) preventing businessman and a promoter of Aircel, C. Sivasankaran, from travelling abroad due to an ongoing inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) into allegations of having caused a loss of over ₹600 crore to IDBI Bank.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy held that Justice P.N. Prakash had rightly dismissed a writ petition filed by the businessman, a Seychelles national who also claimed to be a diplomat, to quash the LOC issued by the Foreigner Regional Registration Officer, Bureau of Immigration, Ministry of Home Affairs.

The Bench pointed out that an Office Memorandum issued by the Centre in 2010, and amended in 2017, permits the FRRO to prevent individuals from travelling abroad if such departure had to be curbed in public interest.

It also rejected contentions that the petitioner enjoyed diplomatic immunity and that his civil rights could not be curtailed.

“This may involve guarantee of liberty to a person under Article 21 of the Constitution but the genesis of the action is connected with pending criminal prosecution, the umbilical cord whereof has not yet snapped,” the Bench said and added that a writ appeal could not be preferred against orders passed on a writ petiton arising out of a criminal matter.

“The contention that it involves civil rights of the appellant is, also, not correct because the relief revolves around consequences arising or likely to arise as a result of criminal prosecution... His movement inside this country being put under surveillance for the purpose of his participation in the criminal prosecution,” the Bench concluded.

Cases listed

In his order, Justice Prakash had listed out details of the cases booked against the petitioner. He said the CBI had found IDBI Bank to have sanctioned a loan of ₹322.40 crore to Finland based Win Wind Oy in which the businessman’s son S. Saravanan was one of the directors.

The entire loan had become a non performing asset (NPA).

Despite knowing well about the poor financial status of Siva Group of Companies led by the businessman, top officials of IDBI Bank colluded with him and extended further credit facilities of ₹523 crore in favour of group company Axcel Sunshine Limited, a company based in British Virgin Islands, for repaying loans of other associate companies.

The CBI team in Bengaluru had registered a case against Axcel Sunshine and 38 others, including some public servants, under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act of 1988.

The case was registered on the basis of directions issued by the Central Vigilance Commission in New Delhi.

Subsequently, the ED also registered a separate case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act of 2002 and attached properties worth ₹224.60 crore. The single judge further rejected the claim of the businessman that he was an Ambassador at Large of the Republic of Seychelles and hence enjoyed diplomatic immunity.

‘Not accredited’

“The petitioner is not accredited to India. He claims himself to be a diplomat of Seychelles Republic. He is not the Ambassador of the Seychelles Republic in India,” the judge said and held that immunity under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention would not apply to him in view of the definition of the term ‘diplomatic agent’ under the convention.

“Article 31 of the Convention will not apply even in respect of a diplomatic agent in the receiving State if he were to indulge in any professional or commercial activity outside his official functions. It is no part of the official functions of the petitioner to take loans from the IDBI Bank and then engage in money laundering,” the judge said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/osezzs/article32763394.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/court-rejects-sivasankarans-plea-against-notice/article32763397.ece

203,2020/10/04,Teachers brainstorm on school-reopening strategy,"E-consortium hosted by Unicef, Solar Trust looks at COVID-19 impact on learning

Bringing together teachers from across the State, Unicef and the Solar Trust on Saturday hosted an e-consortium to discuss the impact COVID-19 has had on school education.

In the first webinar, teachers discussed the findings of a participatory review conducted by Unicef and the Forum for Child-Friendly Schools (FCFS) on the areas that will need attention once schools reopen. The review indicated that 95% teachers felt that sensitising parents and school management committees, and seeking their cooperation and support was a must before reopening schools.

“As far as safety, health and protective measures are concerned, we need to think about the steps that need to be taken right from the time a student leaves his house for school. This includes separate buses for students, handwashing facilities in schools and ensuring adherence to physical distancing norms in classrooms. Parent-teachers’ associations at schools should be roped in to provide inputs and give feedback on the measures implemented,” said Poongodi, a government schoolteacher. Teachers like her, who participated in the e-consortium, shared similar views on measures that schools could take.

Akila Radhakrishnan, social policy specialist, Unicef- Tamil Nadu, said this was a strategic opportunity for reflection among teachers. They could come up with effective solutions for implementation, she said.

For the webinar series, teachers are being motivated to take an evidence-based approach, looking at issues that are impacting teaching and learning.

Ms. Akila said the plan was to have one webinar every month, and based on them, suitable inputs for policy and action would be shared with the State government. Delivering the inaugural address, N. Panchanatham, honorary vice-chancellor, Tamil Nadu Teacher Education University, said teachers need to be ably aided by parents as well as other stakeholders when schools eventually reopen. “At present, it is important that teachers try to bring in creativity and take a holistic approach, with regard to the online classes that they are handling,” he said.

Pinaki Chakraborty, chief, social policy, Unicef State office for T.N. and Kerala, stressed the importance of continuity in learning, and said that digital learning during the pandemic, was, therefore, the best alternative.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/teachers-brainstorm-on-school-reopening-strategy/article32763329.ece

205,2020/10/04,"Chennai continues to see surge with 1,364 fresh infections","State reports 5,622 cases, 65 fatalities; 5,596 persons discharged after treatment

Fresh infections continued to surge in Chennai, as 1,364 more persons tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday. The city has been reporting over 1,000 cases daily since September 24.

With 5,622 new cases, the State’s tally climbed to 6,14,507.

As many as 5,596 persons were discharged, taking the total number of persons discharged so far to 5,58,534. The number of active cases stood at 46,255.

A total of 65 persons — 41 in government hospitals and 24 in private facilities — died, taking the State’s toll to 9,718. Of this, 21 persons died in Chennai, seven in Salem and six in Cuddalore.

This included a 23-year-old man from Coimbatore who was admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on September 23. He was on chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. He died on October 1, due to COVID-19 pneumonia and cardio respiratory failure.

With the new cases, Chennai’s tally rose to 1,71,415. The city has, so far, accounted for 12,311 active cases and 3,262 deaths. A total of 1,55,842 persons have been discharged in the city till now.

Public health officials attributed the steady rise in fresh cases in the city to residents’ non-compliance with norms.

“Many people are still not adhering to precautionary norms, including mask wearing, physical distancing and handwashing. It is important to disinfect places, and avoid unnecessary travel and crowding,” an official said.

Districts’ daily count

There were 486 new cases in Coimbatore, while Chengalpattu and Salem recorded 395 and 351 cases respectively. Tiruvallur reported 290 cases, while Thanjavur continued to witness a surge, with 244 new infections.

206,2020/10/04,Over 525 Direct Purchase Centres opened in delta region to procure paddy,"Food Minister R. Kamaraj rejects allegation of delay in their opening.

Amid complaints of delays in paddy procurement in the Cauvery delta region over the past few days, Food Minister R. Kamaraj said on Saturday that over 500 Direct Purchase Centres (DPCs) had been opened across Tamil Nadu to procure paddy during the kharif season.

In the delta region, the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) had opened 227 DPCs in Thanjavur district, 189 in Tiruvarur, 126 in Nagapattinam and 43 in Cuddalore. Procurement was in full swing after the revised rates, as per the Minimum Support Price announced by the Centre, was uploaded on the devices at the DPCs, he said.

Chief Minister’s fiat

“Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has instructed the Collectors to open more DPCs wherever necessary,” he told reporters after inspecting a few DPCs in Thanjavur district.

Dismissing the Opposition’s allegation that there was a delay in the opening of DPCs for the season, Mr. Kamaraj said orders for opening the DPCs were issued by the Collectors on September 30 and the procurement began on October 1 in Thanjavur district. Around 30,000 tonnes of paddy was procured the same day. Since October 2 was a holiday, there was no procurement, he said, adding the DPCs would function on Sunday.

When his attention was drawn to complaints from farmers that the paddy waiting for procurement at some DPCs had sprouted, Mr. Kamaraj denied that there was any delay in procurement. The pile-up was due to the heavy arrival of paddy simultaneously owing to mechanisation of harvest, unlike in the past when manual harvesting would result in staggered arrivals. Procurement had been stepped up to 1,000 bags a day at each DPC. Previously, only 600-800 bags were procured a day, he said.

On the farmers’ demand for procuring paddy with higher moisture content due to the unexpected rain, Mr. Kamaraj said it was the Centre’s norm that only paddy with moisture content of up to 17% could be procured. “However, we will ensure that farmers are not affected and none will be turned away,” he said.

Pointing out that last year, the TNCSC had procured a record 32.41 lakh tonnes of paddy, benefiting six lakh farmers, Mr. Kamaraj said that this year too, the government would procure the entire paddy arrivals from farmers who had raised the kuruvai crop even on a larger extent of area than normal owing to the timely release of water from the Mettur dam, desilting of canals and moderate rainfall.

Answering a question, he said stern action would be taken on specific complaints of irregularities. There was no question of paddy being brought from other districts for sale in delta districts as DPCs had been opened in all parts of the State.

Later in the day, Mr. Kamaraj inspected DPCs in Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts too.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/s3gsiz/article32763332.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kamarajjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/over-525-direct-purchase-centres-opened-in-delta-region-to-procure-paddy/article32763229.ece

208,2020/10/04,"‘Bigg Boss Tamil’ Season 4 first look: Kamal Haasan returns, new changes to house","A house based on a pop-art theme welcomes the contestants who enter the reality show today

The fourth season of Bigg Boss Tamil is all set to launch today.

Hosted by actor-politician Kamal Haasan, the new season of the reality show is much anticipated as it’s happening in the COVID-era, with plenty of extra precautions taken to ensure the safety of the contestants.

While the list of participants this season hasn’t been confirmed yet, Star Vijay has revealed information on a few changes to the Bigg Boss house.

“While designing the Bigg Boss Tamil season 4 house, the idea was to make it as bright and cheerful and happy as possible, which led the channel to believe that creating a house based on a pop-art theme would be the best route to choose,” reads an official statement.

The kitchen area inside the house

This is the first time that the show will celebrate Diwali, Christmas and New Year during its run. The garden area, the entrance, the washroom, the bedrooms, the living room and the kitchen have been designed to create a sense of happiness and celebration in the minds of the audience.

The dining area for the contestants

In the past few seasons, there was always only one entrance to the washroom area. This time, a new pathway connecting the washroom area to the main house has created a new seating area.

The ‘Jail’ has always been a sore point of discussion with the housemates from the previous seasons. This time, there will be a jail, but it will not be the one seen in previous seasons.

Another change is that the entire house will not be available for use to the housemates when they enter on launch night.

New design changes inside the ‘Bigg Boss Tamil’ house

Names of several actors, TV show hosts, dancers and VJs have been speculated to be part of the show in the build-up, with many hoping to emulate the likes of Oviya, Yashika Aannand, Mugen Rao, Harish Kalyan, Raiza Wilson and others in achieving success in Kollywood after being part of the reality program.

Kamal Haasan

Bigg Boss Tamil season 4 launches on October 4, Sunday 6 pm, and new episodes will be aired every Monday to Sunday at 9.30 pm on Star Vijay",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4m5ju6/article32764890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/32,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bigg-boss-tamil-season-4-first-look-kamal-haasan-returns-new-changes-to-house/article32764894.ece
209,2020/10/04,It’s all about voter enrolment now,"No solution yet to problems faced by graduates

Buzz in political circles across the State

With elections to two seats of graduates constituency in the Legislative Council in the offing, enrolment of eligible graduate voters has become a buzz word in the political circles.

The BJP and the Congress have intensified efforts to retain their traditional votes for giving a tough fight to the ruling party.

The TRS on its part has taken the poll as prestigious issue given the reverses it suffered in the past.

The party could not win Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar constituency despite being in power while it lost Karimnagar-Medak-Adilabad-Nizamabad constituency after registering thumping victory in the previous Assembly elections.

Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao is particular on enrolment of all eligible voters as it will pave the way for easy victory.

This said, solutions to the problems of graduates - be it job opportunities related or inordinate delay in announcement of unemployment dole - continue to persist.

How far the contesting candidates will take the issues faced by graduates is only to be waited and seen.

No end to exchange of political barbs

The political landscape in Telangana is heating up with elections to a few MLC seats, Dubbak Assembly constituency, and to few civic bodies including the GHMC due over the next few months.

The appointment of new in-charge to oversee the party affairs of Congress in the State by AICC has also added some energy not only to the political activity but also to the trading of charges by Congress, TRS and BJP.

The exchange of political barbs is more intense in the State Capital with GHMC elections due soon as the stakes are high not only to the ruling TRS and its ally MIM but also to the Opposition Congress and BJP as the civic body houses nearly one-third of the State’s population.

Amid such a political scenario, a BJP leader Velaga Srinivas is storming the social media throwing repeated challenge at Minister for Urban Development and IT K.T. Rama Rao on the condition of roads in GHMC.

Through text and video messages on social media he seeks ₹100 crore funds and 6 months time to make the City roads water-logging free even in case of deluge!

TRS corporators, a worried lot

With the GHMC elections round the corner, the sitting TRS corporators are spending sleepless nights over their renomination.

A survey by the ruling party apparently revealed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to increase its strength to over 30 in the 150-member Council and the TRS is looking at fresh faces to build up the KTR team as well, many sitting ones are worried.

Some of them expressed their feelings to the MLAs hoping that they will have some say in the party nomination.

TRS, a senior leader felt, was also worried on a section of the YSRCP supporters in the city voting to the BJP this time.

In the last GHMC elections, the YSRCP supporters overwhelmingly supported the TRS candidates to settle scores with the TDP, but the changed political equations in Andhra Pradesh, where Chief Minister Jagan’s team has close working relations with the national BJP leaders, may reflect here as well.

Annual licence fee haunts bar owners

Bars have reopened but the managements dread the thought of paying annual licence fee which was due last month.

After six months of closure of bars on account of COVID, the bars resumed business last week with government permission. However, the government has not spelt out whether the licence fee already paid for the six month period will be adjusted in the next year.

The excise officials maintained that there was no such provision of carry forward of fee but some concession in further payments could be given. For instance, the managements may be given the option of paying fee in four instalments against three at present.

210,2020/10/04,High-level police officers meet on Maoist movement in TS,"Discussions on sharing of intelligence, better coordination

To chart out a coordinated action plan to foil attempts by Maoists to gain ground in vast tribal belt stretching along the Telangana-Chhattisgarh border, a high-level meeting involving the top officials of the Telangana and Chhattisgarh State police forces and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was held in Venkatapuram of the tribal dominated Mulugu district on Sunday.

The meeting was attended by CRPF Director-General A.P. Maheshwari, Senior Security Advisor in the Home Ministry K. Vijay Kumar, Telangana DGP M. Mahender Reddy, Chhattisgarh’s Bastar Range Inspector General of Police P. Sundarraj, Superintendents of Police (SPs) of the bordering districts of both Telangana and Chhattisgarh, among others, sources said.

The meeting reportedly lasted for more than two hours late on Sunday afternoon.

Operational strategies

It discussed threadbare operational strategies such as strengthening intelligence network, better coordination between the CRPF and the State police forces for effectively tackling Maoists and thwarting attempts by the rebels to revive their activities in the forested border region between Telangana and Chhattisgarh, sources added.

The high-level meeting in the border mandal comes close on the heels of reported movement of Maoists in the Agency areas of Mulugu and Bhadradri-Kothagudem districts, which share a border with areas of Maoist influence in Chhattisgarh, in the last few days.

The Telangana’s tribal heartland of Bhadrachalam Agency witnessed several instances of skirmishes between the rebels and the police in the recent past.

Recent deaths

As many as eight Maoists were killed in separate incidents of “exchange of fire” with the police in Bhadradri-Kothagudem and Asifabad Kumram Bheem districts last month.

The Maoists observed a State bandh on September 28 in protest against what the rebels termed “fake encounter killing” of its eight cadres.

The meeting is understood to have discussed strategies to bolster coordination for effective vigil and deployment of forces along all the possible entry points in the porous forested border region to curb Maoist activities on Telangana-Chhattisgarh border.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/high-level-police-officers-meet-on-maoist-movement-in-ts/article32766908.ece
211,2020/10/04,Controversy surrounds Telangana BJP leaders,"BJP State president's close aide caught up in allegations following a viral video.

In Telangana, controversy is brewing over allegations that BJP State president Bandi Sanjay’s close aide K. Murali indulged in immoral activities.

The allegations were made by Karimnagar-based woman, who told a TV channel that a few BJP leaders had used her house to carry out immoral activities. These charges, which emerged close on the heels of Mr. Sanjay sacking Karimnagar district BJP president Basa Satyanarayana, deepened the controversy surrounding BJP leaders.

The backstory

Three days ago, BJP had sacked its septuagenarian leader Basa Satyanarayana and appointed Krishna Reddy from Huzurabad as the new district president. No reason was given for this unexpected decision.

However, reports started doing rounds that Mr. Satyanarayana’s sacking was connected to a video in which a man was seen semi-naked in the house of a woman. Some alleged that the man in the viral video was Mr. Satyanarayana, and hence the party was compelled to remove him to save face.

The woman, in whose house the video was recorded, told journalists that she had been in a live-in relationship with Mr. Satyanarayana for the past year. She claimed that she was unaware how the video got leaked but maintained that she had already spoken to Mr. Sanjay about Mr. Satyanarayana.

The woman also said that a BJP woman activist had come to her house in Karimnagar and spent time with Mr. Murali, who is Mr. Sanjay’s close aide. “That BJP woman activist said that unless she did so, she would not be able to rise in position in the party,” the woman told a TV journalist.

BJP reacts

Mr. Sanjay, who is an MP from Karimnagar, said serious action would be taken if any of his party activists resort to illegal activities. Speaking to The Hindu over phone from Delhi, he said, “if anyone tries to damage party’s image with issues related to their personal life, disciplinary actions would automatically follow.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/2022bj/article30496699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07-SMITA-CHALLENGES1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/controversy-surrounds-telangana-bjp-leaders/article32764709.ece
212,2020/10/04,Governor urged to order CBI probe into Nayeem’s cases,"FGG questions SIT clean chit to 25 police officers

Forum for Good Governance (FGG) on Saturday appealed to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to order for a CBI investigation into the cases involving slain Naxalite-turned-gangster Nayeemuddin and his associates.

In a memorandum to the governor, the FGG said that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the government in 2016 to investigate the cases involving Nayeem is incapable of executing the task.

FGG secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy, later speaking to the media, said that names of 25 police officers, some of them of the rank of Additional Superintendents of Police, cropped up in the initial stages of probe. However, the SIT replied to an inquiry under RTI Act that no policeman was cited as accused in any of the 173 criminal cases involving Nayeem’s gang. That amounted to giving clean chit to all the 25 police officers, and no action was being taken against them, he said.

FGG said that about 240 cases were registered after Nayeem was killed in an exchange of fire in 2016 based on his gang’s involvement in different crimes. Though it was said that chargesheets were filed in 173 cases so far, not a single case was taken to its logical end, he said.

It was said that Nayeem used to write diaries in which he would meticulously incorporate details of all his contacts, whom he had helped and the favours he got from them. During the raid on his house following his death, police seized two of his diaries, he said. “...But the diaries were not used in inquiry and in a way some IPS officers and politicians were left off the hook,” the FGG said. The FGG said Nayeem’s was a deadly combination of police, politicians and gangster coming together and committing atrocities against innocent people. Unless the probe was completed fairly and quickly, general public would lose faith in democracy, it said.

The FGG also expressed doubts over the figures of money seized by the police from Nayeem’s house. SIT had claimed to have used two counting machines to count money in his house but confirmed that only ₹3.74 lakh were recovered. “That sum can be counted in 15 minutes. Then what was the need for counting machines? We have a reason to believe that hundreds of crores were recovered and not accounted for,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/wgnqu6/article32764595.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-NAYEEMUDDIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/governor-urged-to-order-cbi-probe-into-nayeems-cases/article32764596.ece

214,2020/10/04,Coronavirus | Former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi still in ICU,"He is experiencing weakness but insists on being updated with political and other developments, says a party leader

Former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi continues to be in the intensive care unit of the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), where he was admitted on September 24 following post-COVID-19 complications.

Mr. Gogoi, 85, had been admitted to the GMCH on August 26 after testing positive for COVID-19 and was discharged over two weeks later. But his health deteriorated sharply 11 days ago. “His oxygen level is above the 90 mark, which is not unusual for a person of his age. But he is experiencing weakness that has confined him to the bed,” a doctor said, declining to be quoted.

A Congress leader close to Mr. Gogoi’s family said the former CM has been speaking to visitors and reading up on political and other developments in Assam and elsewhere in the country and beyond. “He insists on being updated from time to time,” the party leader said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/i2tluk/article32700046.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TARUNGOGOI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/former-assam-cm-still-in-icu/article32766713.ece
215,2020/10/04,AIUDF joins hands with Congress for Assam poll,"Congress cautions new regional parties that BJP will return to power if not stopped together

The All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) led by perfume baron Maulana Badruddin Ajmal will contest the 2021 Assam Assembly election in alliance with the Congress and the Left Front.

The decision to accept the proposal from the Congress was taken at the core committee meeting of the party held here on Saturday.

“The meeting was delayed because of the COVID-19 restrictions. Our president [Mr Ajmal] gave his assent to joining hands with the Congress and other like-minded, secular political parties that have opposed the Citizenship [Amendment] Act,” AIUDF spokesperson Haider Hussain Bora said.

“The AIUDF’s approval for taking on the BJP together has paved the way for a mahajoot [grand alliance],” Congress spokesperson Rhituparna Konwar said, adding that the Communist Party of India, the CPI (Marxist) and the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) had come on board the anti-BJP alliance.

CM candidate

The two parties had discussed the possibility of a grand alliance almost two months ago. But there were differences on the issue of projecting the chief ministerial candidate. The issue is now likely to be discussed after the “grand alliance” is in a position to form the government.

Congress MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the 126-member Assembly, Debabrata Saikia, on Sunday reminded the new regional parties that the BJP could return to power if not stopped together.

“Some regional parties have virtually become defunct while a few new ones have been formed with the avowed goal of dislodging the BJP in the 2021 elections. I wish them all the best, but the BJP will return to power if the anti-BJP forces fail to forge a united front,” he said.

He said this with reference to the Raijor Dal, the political party that peasant rights leader Akhil Gogoi’s group, the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, and its associates launched on October 2.

The Congress leader also alluded to the Asom Jatiya Parishad that two influential students’ organisations — the All Assam Students’ Union and the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad — had formed in September.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/g96cvv/article32766537.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THRDAJMAL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aiudf-joins-hands-with-cong-for-assam-poll/article32766538.ece
216,2020/10/04,We cannot be selective in condemning violence: J&K L-G,"Manoj Sinha visits militancy-infested Kulgam as part of “Back to Village-3” programme

J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Sunday visited the militancy-infested Kulgam and called for equal condemnation violence and killings “whether the common man or security forces”.

“We can’t be selective in condemning violence. Violence, killings of innocents should be condemned, whether it’s the killings of common people or security forces. I appeal to all to contribute towards peace. L-G Sinha said during his visit to Ashthal in Kulgam as part of the ongoing “Back to Village-3” programme.

Referring to the ₹1,951 crore earmarked for the development of villages, he said the agriculture and the horticulture sectors were provided ₹1,872 crore, which is ₹680 crore more compared to the last year.

“I am working on four key points for the development of J&K: Accelerating growth, providing benefits of social security and social welfare schemes to all, eliminating regional disparities and effective execution of works,” the L-G said.

He said there shall be no backward area in the entire J&K soon.

“I have brought the government to your doorstep. Now, you shall decide the works to be completed and to be taken up on priority. The Back to Village is a celebration of people’s participation in development.” Mr. Sinha said he was surprised to notice unusual delays in projects when he took over as the L-G. “I will ensure that those responsible for unwarranted delays will be made answerable.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gjcbiu/article32746606.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01MANOJSINHAPCDELHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/we-cannot-be-selective-in-condemning-violence-jk-l-g/article32766522.ece
217,2020/10/04,Plea to remove Mathura Idgah Masjid dismissed,"Suit from devotees untenable, a threat to judicial system, says court

Dismissing a suit seeking the removal of the Shahi Idgah Masjid adjacent to the Shri Krishna Temple in Mathura, a local court observed that if each and every devotee of Lord Krishna was allowed to institute such suits, it would jeopardise the judicial and social system.

In an order dated September 30, civil judge (senior division) Chhaya Sharma noted that it was well established that Lord Krishna was a revered deity of Hindu religion and was known as an avatar of Lord Vishnu. While stating that Lord Krishna had countless followers and devotees across the world, the judge said if every devotee was allowed to file a suit like this, it would jeopardise the judicial and social system.

The court also said the argument of the plaintiffs to institute the suit on the basis of them being devotees was not justified and was legally untenable.

The judge, while deciding on the maintainability of the suit, said the plaintiffs do not have the right to sue in the matter and hence there was no base to register the case.

The suit was filed by Lucknow-based advocate Ranjana Agnihotri and seven others on behalf of the child deity Bhagwan Shri Krishna Virajman. The U.P. Sunni Central Waqf Board and the Committee Of Management of Trust of Shahi Idgah were arraigned as defendants along with Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Trust, Mathura, and Shri Krishna Janma Sthan Seva Sansthan.

The suit sought cancellation of the decree passed in July 1973 by Civil Judge, Mathura, declaration, prohibitory and mandatory injunction and for removal of encroachment from the land in question. It had also sought recovery of 13.37 acres situated within the area of the temple.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/plea-to-remove-mathura-idgah-masjid-dismissed/article32766081.ece
218,2020/10/04,"Shorn of living mascot, 600-year-old Budgam mosque under threat","With its iconic chinar tree cut down, the prayer hall in the central Kashmir mughal sarai is easy prey to encroachers

Once a prayer hall for Mughal emperors during their visits to Kashmir in the summer, the 300-square feet, 16th century mosque in the Khanpur mughal sarai (inn) in Budgam is a picture of forlorn neglect.

The mosque of stone and lime mortar with a tiled roof, stands out despite the several new constructions coming up around it. It has the typical architectural grammar of the Mughal era, with small arched windows well placed to allow cross ventilation and the ‘Mehrab’, a semicircular niche in the wall to lead prayers.

But in an ominous sign, the ancient chinar tree which stood by the mosque was cut down last month by locals. The destruction of the tree, a constant at all religious places in Kashmir, came despite the ban on the felling of the species.

“The chinar was precariously positioned and may have damaged nearby houses,” said Rasheed Ahmad, a nearby shopkeeper, justifying the axing of the ancient tree.

Other local residents fear the felling of the chinar is the first sign that the mosque will be usurped, as was the mughal sarai located at Shadi Marg in Pulwama. That structure is now home to a group of families despite its once famed walls leaning and caving-in at multiple points.

Saleem Beg, ex-chairman of the National Monuments Authority of India and convener INTACH, J&K has raised the alarm over the Budgam mosque.

“The Archaeological Survey of India has the site already protected in 1958. For unknown reasons, the ASI then did not include the mosque, which is about 300 square feet. The structure continues to be at the site,” Mr. Beg told The Hindu.

In a letter to the Budgam district administration, Mr. Beg underlined that sarais on the Mughal route in J&K always had a mosque adjacent to the main premises.

“A fully grown Chinar planted during the Mughal times in the open space of the mosque delineated the mosque premises. The chinar has been felled and vandalized. This has resulted in removing the only buffer between the mosque and the private residences,” Mr. Beg said.

He raised concerns that with the removal of the chinar, the open space “may be encroached taking advantage of the absence of any watch and ward or any public ownership.”

“There would be an official record of the mosque and the chinar therein but there is no notice or fence at the site so that the area could be secured from encroachment,” Mr Beg said.

Calling for an inquiry into cutting down of the chinar, Mr Beg said, “The sarai is an important monument representing the Mughal heritage and a part of the cultural route known as the Mughal route.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/u87ou1/article32766040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shorn-of-living-mascot-600-year-old-budgam-mosque-under-threat/article32766041.ece

He was Agriculture Minister from 2011-2012 and was made Minister again between 2014 and 2017. He returned to hold portfolios such as Agriculture and Farmers Empowerment, Panchayati Raj and Drinking Water and Fisheries and Animal Resources Development from 2017 to 2019.

Mr. Maharathy remained a controversial figure in the State politics for his alleged criminal background. He had more than two dozens cases against him, including attempt to murder, molestation, rioting, theft, criminal intimidation and dacoity. He owned a commercial theatre group.

“The sad demise of the Maharathy is an irreparable loss to the State and the members of their family,” said Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in the Assembly on Sunday.

220,2020/10/04,Assam Rifles jawan killed in Arunachal ambush,"Security forces suspect role of NSCN-K and United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent in the attack

Suspected extremists on Sunday ambushed and killed an Assam Rifles jawan in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh.

Another jawan was injured seriously in the ambush around 9 a.m. near Hetlong village under the Jairampur police station.

No group has taken responsibility, but district officials and the security forces suspect 30-35 members of the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent headed by Paresh Baruah and the Khaplang faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K) carried out the attack.

“A water tanker of the 19 Assam Rifles that was travelling to Hetlong village to fetch water came under attack,” Changlang District Magistrate Devansh Yadav said.

“We received reports that there was an explosion, but this cannot be confirmed until we receive the autopsy report. In all likelihood, the death was caused by bullet,” he added.

A defence spokesperson said the injured jawan was admitted to a government hospital in Changlang. It was not immediately known how many personnel were travelling in the water tanker. It was not escorted by any other vehicle.

In May 2019, suspected NSCN-K militants had carried out a similar attack on an Assam Rifles water tanker in Nagaland’s Mon district in which two personnel were killed and three others injured.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hoz5iq/article32765453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AssamRifles,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-rifles-jawan-killed-in-arunachal-ambush/article32765454.ece
221,2020/10/04,"Congress will repeal farm laws, promises Rahul Gandhi","Congress leader kicks-off three-day tractor rally in Punjab

Former Congress president and MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday hit out at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, accusing it of playing into the hands of “big corporates” to compromise the interests of the farming community.

Mr. Gandhi, who kick-started Congress party’s three-day ‘tractor rally’ — Kheti Bachao Yatra — against the three recent farm sector legislations, said the Congress would repeal the legislations as soon as it was back in power.

“The Congress is firmly standing with farmers and I guarantee you that the day when Congress comes to power we will scrap these three black laws and consign them to the dustbin,” said Mr. Gandhi, before taking off on the tractor rally through Moga and Ludhiana districts.

“The Central government is a puppet government, whose strings are in the hands of the Adanis and the Ambanis. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been misleading the nation for the past six years to serve the interests of 2-3 large corporate houses,” said Mr. Gandhi, citing examples of demonetisation, GST and the debt and tax waiver of big industrialists amid the pandemic, while not giving any monetary aid to the poor and the farmers.

“We are with you (farmers) in this fight for their survival and livelihood, which the Modi government is trying to destroy with these draconian laws. Together we will change these laws,” he said.

Mr. Gandhi questioned the need to push agriculture sector laws urgently without any discussion in Parliament even as the country was fighting COVID-19.

“If the farmers are happy with these legislations, as the Centre government is claiming, then why are they agitating in Punjab and the rest of the country, ” he asked.

The Congress leader added that the new laws were aimed at eventually dismantling the Minimum Support Price (MSP) structure and government procurement system, which he said, would break the backbone of the farmers, just as the British had done to seize control of India.

“The central government was also trying to break the farmers’ backbone to hand over the entire farming system to their industrialist. We, however, will not let it happen.

222,2020/10/04,Hathras case | Upper caste group holds meet in support of accused,"Police lathi-charge RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary, workers.

October 4 saw a large gathering of upper caste men in Hathras in support of persons accused in the gang rape and murder of a Dalit woman even as police lathi-charged Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) vice-president Jayant Chaudhary and his associates while they were on their way to meet the family of the victim.

“The arrogant Yogi government wants to suppress the Opposition voice through police lathis,” the RLD said in a tweet sharing visuals showing the sudden police lathi charge on Mr. Chaudhary and his team even as he was talking to the media. Police were seen severely beating the RLD workers as they tried to shield Mr. Chaudhary.

Tweeting about his ordeal, Mr. Chaudhary said if the government had the right to use lathis, he had the right to stand by his people. “Use lathis as much as you can, our resolve will only get stronger,” Mr. Chaudhary said.

Hathras police said the RLD workers had broken the police barriers and pushed and shoved police personnel on duty, and to bring the situation under control, “light force” was used against the agitated crowd.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted in support of Mr. Chaudhary, and said the police action against the RLD leader was condemnable.

Ground Zero | A long caste feud, a horrific crime, and a sudden cremation

BSP chief Mayawati and Ms. Vadra also demanded action against the District Magistrate of Hathras and a probe into his role in the entire incident which culminated in the rushed late night cremation of the victim by the police, allegedly without permission from her family.

In a massive show of strength, men from the dominant caste gathered at the residence of a former BJP MLA Rajvir Singh Pehalvan amid heavy police deployment, some 6 km from the victim’s village Bulagarhi. The meeting was described as a thanksgiving meeting after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recommended a CBI probe into the case. Mr. Pahalwan said since the gathering was being held in his private space, it did not amount to violation of Section 144 which has been imposed on the area due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr. Pehalvan’s son, Manveer Singh, one of the organiser’s of the meeting, said the men had gathered in support of the accused. He said two of the accused were innocent, citing the fact that they were picked up from their homes.

“If they were guilty would they not try to run,” Mr. Singh said in their defence, speaking to a news channel.

He also demanded that a police case be lodged against the family of the victim.

A delegation led by Samajwadi Party leader Dharmendra Yadav met the family of the victim and demanded that, as per the wishes of the kin, the case be probed by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court.

“The administration is being made a scapegoat. The people actually responsible are sitting in Lucknow,” Mr. Yadav said.

Ms. Mayawati said the Uttar Pradesh government's “mysterious silence” on the allegations of intimidation levelled against the Hathras District Magistrate by the family of the rape victim was “sad and worrisome”. Though the government has agreed to a CBI probe, how can an impartial probe be conducted with the DM still posted there, asked the BSP chief.

Ms. Vadra, who visited the victim’s family with Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders on October 3, also targetted Mr. Laxkar and asked who was protecting him. She demanded that he be immediately removed and his role in the episode investigated. “According to the aggrieved family of Hathras, the DM was the one who misbehaved the most with them,” she said.

Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Sunday said the Uttar Pradesh government's ""mysterious silence"" on the allegations of intimidation levelled against the Hathras District Magistrate by the family of the rape victim was ""sad and worrisome.""

Though the government has agreed to a CBI probe, how can an impartial probe be conducted with the DM still posted there, asked the BSP chief.

The family of the victim had levelled many serious allegations of intimidation against the DM, Ms. Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.

""UP government's mysterious silence is sad and worrisome,"" she said.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who visited the home of the family along with her brother Rahul Gandhi on Saturday, also targeted the Hathras DM Praveen Kumar Laxkar and asked who was protecting him. She demanded that the DM be immediately removed and his role in the episode be investigated.

""According to the aggrieved family of Hathras, the DM was the one who misbehaved the most with them,"" she said.

The UP government had late on Friday suspended Hathras SP Vikrant Vir and four other policemen after the first report of the Special Investigation Team found negligence on their part.

Mr. Adityanath then on Saturday recommended a CBI probe into the case.

However, Ms. Vadra on Sunday wondered that while the family of the girl was demanding a judicial probe why was the government SIT probe still on even after a CBI probe was recommended by the state.

""If the UP government has woken up from its sleep even a bit, it should listen to the family,"" Ms. Vadra said on Twitter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ttg83r/article32764918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mayawati-priyanka-gandhi-call-for-action-against-hathras-district-magistrate/article32764915.ece
224,2020/10/04,Madhya Pradesh High Court advises political parties to campaign through electronic means,"The Gwalior Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court has advised political parties to campaign through the electronic means instead of the physical form in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Justices Sheel Nagu and Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava in an interim order on October 3 directed District Magistrates of nine districts falling under the Bench to register cases against members of a congregation and its organisers, including political leaders or government officials, who violated COVID-19 norms.

The Justices gave the direction that cases must be registered “failing which the District Magistrates of the concerned nine districts shall be liable for contempt of this Court and shall also be exposed to the rigors of penal provisions of relevant laws.”

Based on the material placed on record, the court, while hearing a petition filed by lawyer Ashish Pratap Singh, observed the State and government functionaries were indulging in activities leading to congregations. “Such congregations, it is scientifically proved, can invariably lead to further spread of COVID-19 infection,” they noted.

In addition, the court exhorted political parties and the State government to set an example for voters and the public by adhering to the COVID-19 norms issued by the Central government, the state Government and District Magistrates from time to time.

The Justices also directed the Principal Registrar to place the matter before the appropriate Bench in case the three advocates appointed as amicus curiae or any citizen pointed out the breach of the interim order or the COVID-19 norms.

Following the previous interim order, the amicus curiae had jointly filed two reports, “both prima facie revealing widespread breach of Covid-19 protocol” based on various congregations. Thereafter, the court heard District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police of five districts where the byelections were due.

Byelections to 28 Assembly seats are due in Madhya Pradesh on November 3, of which 25 were vacated after Congress MLAs quit the party and switched over to the BJP, while three were vacated after deaths of sitting MLAs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/f3j4bm/article32764765.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADHYAPRADESHCAMPAIGN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-high-court-advises-political-parties-to-campaign-through-electronic-means/article32764720.ece

South Kashmir’s Pulwama district has witnessed a jump from 2% prevalence of the COVID-19-generated antibodies among the location population to 27.3% in just two months, indicating a growing trend of seroprevalence in the Valley.

According to the latest survey of the Indian Council of Medical Research, 413 blood samples were collected in 10 different clusters of Pulwama.

“Out of 413, 113 reported to be positive for IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 infection, which makes it to 27.3% prevalence, with Sona Samilo village cluster showing highest 52.5% positive prevalence,” the survey suggested.

The first round of ICMR’s national sero survey for SARS COV-2 infection (COVID-19) in Pulwama district carried out between May and June showed only 2% seroprevalence among the population. “From just 2% to over 27% in two months means the disease has been spreading considerably. We are expecting a similar pattern in other districts too,” said Dr. Salim Khan, nodal officer for COVID-19, and Head of the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine (SPM), Government Medical College, Srinagar.

226,2020/10/04,Kasauli awaits tourists with fingers crossed,"The hospitality sector in Himachal is hoping for a revival after the lockdown

It’s half past noon on October 2, and a family of four has just walked into a small cafe on Mall Road in the heart of the tiny hill town of Kasauli.

Navneet Sahu, who runs the little eatery, is elated to see customers again, even as he is concerned that his joy would be short-lived and limited to the ‘extended weekend’ that has brought a sizeable rush of tourists to the Queen of the Hills.

“Tourists have started to visit after travel restrictions were eased recently. But it’s nothing compared to the numbers before the COVID-19 outbreak. Since March end, the business has come to a standstill,” said Mr. Sahu, who busy preparing the food order for his customers, with just one helper.

The hospitality industry in Himachal Pradesh has been severely affected due to the pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. The State government allowed unrestricted entry into the State from mid-September, which has come as a big relief.

Focus on breaking even

The hoteliers, however, said that right now they are focusing on merely breaking even. Other sections of the industry, including taxi drivers, tourist guides, dhabas and small restaurants are pinning their hopes on a revival of the hotels.

“It will take sometime to get things back to normal. So far there have only been ‘walk-in’ tourists. At this time of the year we usually had good number of tourists from West Bengal during the Dushera-Durga Puja holidays. But this year, there have been no advance bookings,” said U. Sharma of Ros Common, a Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation hotel.

Sharing his concerns, Deepak Sharma, who runs a dhaba on the Kasauli-Dharmpur road, said the though the weekend business had resumed, the overall sales were well below the pre-COVID period. Lack of workers has also impacted the industry, with many having returned to their homes during the extended lockdown.

Vice-president of the Kasauli Hotels and Resident Welfare Association Rocky Chimni said the State government has allowed hotels to open from mid-September, and since then most of the hotels have reopened in the town and surrounding area. “Tourists have started visiting over weekends and weekdays as well and more are coming from Delhi and Punjab. The corporate business has taken a hit as conferences etc., are not taking place. We are hoping that we will be close to break-even point as the number of tourists increase. In comparison to the same period last year the hotels in Kasauli are having 40% less occupancy,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w9npa2/article32761642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kasauli-Mall-Road1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kasauli-awaits-tourists-with-fingers-crossed/article32764565.ece
227,2020/10/04,Assam Gurkhas seek gazette notification for safeguards,"This follows their exclusion from rights in Clause 6 of Accord

The Gurkha community in Assam has sought gazette notification on the issue of including it for constitutional safeguards according to Clause 6 of the 1985 Assam Accord.

Clause 6 of the Accord that ended the anti-foreigners Assam Agitation from 1979-1985 envisages constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards for protecting, preserving and promoting the culture, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.

A 14-member panel headed by retired judge Biplab Kumar Sharma had defined “Assamese people” as those who have been citizens of India residing in the territory of Assam on or before January 1, 1951.

“The Clause 6 committee report did not mention anything about the constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards of local Gorkhas who fought for Assam against the Burmese invaders in 1826 resulting in the Treaty of Yandaboo,” said the Bharatiya Gorkha Yuva Parisangh (BGYP) in a statement.

The Gurkhas were permanently settled in the scheduled areas in the last part of the 18th century as grazers and cultivators and were accordingly given permits. They were declared as protected class by the British in the tribal belts and blocks according to the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation Act, 1886, the organisation said.

Minister’s assurance

A delegation of the Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangh, the parent body of the BGYP, a few days ago met State Finance and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who agreed that the Gurkhas in Assam are “one of the ancient communities”. He said the government would treat them “on a par with other indigenous communities and protect their constitutional rights while implementing Clause 6”.

BGYP president Nanda Kirati Dewan welcomed Mr. Sarma’s statement and requested the government to issue a gazette notification for the including the community within the ambit of Clause 6. “The gazette notification is a request on behalf of 25 lakh Gurkhas in Assam, who were given a commitment before the 2016 Assembly elections,” he said.

In January 2019, the Ministry of Home Affairs formed the Clause 6 panel headed by retired bureaucrat M.P. Bezbaruah but six of the nine members named quit. The panel was reconstituted almost six months later, on July 16. On February 25, the committee submitted the report to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal for handing it over to Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

But some members of the committee on August 11 made their “confidential” report public because of the government’s “disinterest” in processing their recommendations.

Among the suggestions made by the panel were sealing of the India-Bangladesh border and reservation of 80-100% of the seats in Parliament from Assam for the Assamese people.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-gurkhas-seek-gazette-notification-for-safeguards/article32764563.ece

Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project be declared a national project as it will address the drinking water and irrigation needs of 13 districts in the State.

‘Lifeline of districts’

The former Deputy Chief Minister in a letter to Mr. Modi said the project will become the lifeline of the districts in East Rajasthan where agriculture and animal husbandry is the prime source of livelihood but groundwater in the area is depleting.

He said the NITI Aayog has also included Dholpur and Karauli districts in “aspirational district” category because they are half developed.

Highlighting the importance of water in the development of a region, the Tonk MLA said Rajasthan’s geographical area is 10% of the country’s area but only 1.16% of surface water and 1.72% of groundwater of the country is available in the State.

“Since 245 of total 295 blocks are under the dark or critical zone, the State government had forwarded a proposal of the eastern canal project, which aims to develop irrigation area of nearly 3 lakh hectare, to the Centre for technical approval and financing,” Mr. Pilot wrote.

He said the project will accelerate the overall development not only in eastern parts but in the entire State and requested the PM to give technical sanction and financial assistance for the project worth ₹37,247 crore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ov2ct4/article32764550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03DELPRIYASACHINPILOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sachin-pilot-seeks-national-status-for-canal-project/article32764551.ece

West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Saturday said it will ‘gherao’ block development offices in 10 districts on Monday in protest against the “corruption” of ruling Trinamool Congress in distribution of relief materials to those affected by cyclone Amphan.

Mr Ghosh told reporters after a rally at Mahisadal in Purbo Medinipur that the ₹1,000-crore alloted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for Amphan relief did not make it to the needy.

“None other than the TMC supremo and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee admitted there was corruption in distribution of relief materials. But, is mere admission enough?

‘Taking disciplinary action against the corrupt partymen will not change the condition of the poor cyclone-hit villagers as well,” he said.

Thousands of BJP activists will demonstrate outside BDO offices in 160 blocks and submit a deputation to them on Monday, he said.

Mr Ghosh said the saffron party will also highlight the “rise in attack” on BJP activists “by the TMC and police”.

“Around 120 of our ‘karyakatas’, including an MLA, was killed and our rallies are stopped by police and ruling party goons. In Kolkata, police and TMC activists did not let our democratic bike rally continue on Friday and they snatched the keys of 200 bikes,” he alleged.

238,2020/10/04,Residents upset over faulty drainage channel in Erode,"They want it demolished and a new one constructed

The residents of Balusamy Nagar in Lakkapuram Panchayat in Modakurichi Union are unhappy with the way the panchayat had constructed a drainage channel in their area.

With over 60 houses, the locality lacked basic amenities and sewage was discharged in the open for the last 30 years.

The demand for a drainage channel was finally fulfilled with the panchayat constructing a channel for 500 m and the work was completed recently. But the channel was constructed 1.5 metres higher the ground level, while the houses are below the road level.

B. Anitha, a resident, said that the drainage channel does not serve the purpose. “The channel is above the ground level, which means sewage and rainwater will enter our houses,” she said. The channel also blocked the entry for most of the houses, and they had to construct steps to enter their houses.

“Instead of digging the earth for constructing the channel, the contractor constructed it above the ground level,” said Sathish Kumar, another resident. “Now I need to pump sewage from my house using a motor and discharge it into the channel,” he said.

Residents claimed that their opposition during the construction of the channel went unheard.

“The contractor who built the channel asked us to raise the level of our houses by three feet. We want the faulty drainage channel demolished and a new one constructed by digging the ground,” said S. Rani, another resident.

Panchayat officials said that after inspecting the channel, they would take necessary action.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bf2582/article32767290.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER05DRAINAGECHANNEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/residents-upset-over-faulty-drainage-channel-in-erode/article32767291.ece

241,2020/10/04,"Health Dept. urges elderly, people with comorbidities to take extra caution","With Coimbatore district witnessing new cases of COVID-19 at a steady pace, the Health Department has urged people aged above 60 and those with comorbidities to be extra cautious as they are more vulnerable to develop severe conditions of the disease upon getting infected.

The rationale behind the caution is that aged persons, those who have undergone organ transplantation and those suffering from comorbidities including coronary artery disease, cancer, obesity, renal failure and hypertension are more likely to require care in intensive care units or beds with ventilator support. These are in high demand now.

According to Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, people aged above 60 and those suffering from other ailments need to take extra caution though all are bound to follow safety guidelines.

He said that adhering to safety guidelines such as use of mask, physical distancing, frequent hand washing and avoiding exposure to crowded places were paramount to combat the disease spread.

K. Kolandasamy, former Director of Public Health, Tamil Nadu, also felt that aged and comorbid persons should ensure more caution.

According to him, protecting people who are in the vulnerable categories from COVID-19 infection will also reduce casualties caused by the disease.

“Asymptomatic patients could be present in the population who become unknown transmitters of the disease. Following safety guidelines is the only means to protect oneself,” he said.

The second sero-survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in Coimbatore district to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, result of which was given to the Health Department on September 30, showed that 31 (7.2 %) out of the 428 blood samples collected from the district had IgG antibodies against the virus.

According to health officials, this could mean that 31 out of the 428 people, who were randomly examined, had exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the viral load could not have been enough to manifest into infection. In the first survey conducted in May, IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 were found in 10 (2.5 %) out of 400 random samples.

“The survey result indicates an increase in people’s exposure to the virus in areas from where the samples were collected,” said a health official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ab6v29/article32767254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB05HEALTHWORKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/health-dept-urges-elderly-people-with-comorbidities-to-take-extra-caution/article32767255.ece
242,2020/10/04,Four killed in accident near Coimbatore,"Three more persons suffer injuries

Four persons were killed on the spot after a sports utility vehicle and a car collided head on near Sirumugai in Coimbatore late on Saturday.

The Sirumugai police said that all the four passengers of the SUV were killed and three passengers of the hatchback were injured in the accident which took place at Rangampalayam.

The deceased were identified as Aravindh Ponnusamy (26) from Kalikanaickenpalayam, Mohanraj Subbaiyan (47) from Chinnamathipalayam, Naveen Kumar (45) from Veerakeralam and D. Rajan (47) from Sundakampalayam.

According to the police, the accident took place when the four persons were returning from Subbaiyan's farmland at Sathyamangalam in Erode district.

Kumar drove the SUV.

As the SUV reached Rangampalayam on Sathyamangalam - Sirumugai Road, it collided with a hatchback which came from the opposite side.

The SUV overturned in the impact of the collision, said the police.

Passengers of the hatchback S. Kousal (27) from Velandipalayam, Belgin (25) from Elupanatham and N. Devanth (27) from Bellepalayam suffered injuries and they were admitted to the Government Hospital at Sathyamangalam.

244,2020/10/04,Authorities’ attention drawn to illegal building completion certificate,"In August this year, the Coimbatore Corporation Assistant Commissioner for North Zone issued a letter to an applicant who had sought building completion certificate.

The applicant had sought the certificate to avail of power connection, as mandated under the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019. The Rules state that completion certificate from the competent authority – local body or local planning authority – was necessary for water, sewerage and power connection for residential buildings with up to three dwelling units measuring not more than 8,000 sq.ft. and less than 12m in height.

The Rules also exempt industrial buildings from completion certificates.

In his letter, the Assistant Commissioner said the applicant had sought building plan approval for a 1,310 sq.ft. on the ground floor and a similar on the first floor with two dwelling units.

And, the applicant had built a building on the ground floor measuring 1,802 sq.ft. with a dwelling unit, a building on the first floor measuring 1,914 sq.ft. With three dwelling units and a stair case room on the second floor measuring 104 sq.ft.

The Assistant Commissioner went on to add that the Corporation had assessed the ground floor building and first floor building in two different tax assessments.

The Assistant Commissioner’s letter was in gross violation of the letter and spirit of the Rules, said Coimbatore Consumer Cause Secretary K. Kathirmathiyon. The officer had acknowledged the illegality in construction, and by saying that the Corporation has assessed it for tax, seemed to pave way for the Tangedco to provide power connection.

This went against the very purpose for which the State government had framed the Rules – check the construction of buildings in violation of rules by denying power, water and sewerage connection.

Mr. Kathirmathiyon said the officer's letter also showed that the Coimbatore Corporation did not follow the Rules to issue building completion certificate in a standard format. The Corporation’s tax assessment of building was not the same as issuing building completion certificate.

The Coimbatore Consumer Cause had pointed this out to the Corporation and this forced the then Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath to withdraw his letter in this regard.

As local body officials still seemed to be unfamiliar with the Rules, his organisation had written to the Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department Secretary to look into the issue.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/authorities-attention-drawn-to-illegal-building-completion-certificate/article32767196.ece
245,2020/10/04,Residents want Coimbatore Corporation to restore road at earliest,"Plan protests if the civic body further delays the work

The trench and pit the Coimbatore Corporation has dug on Perumal Kovil Street in Konavaikalpalayam, Velllalore, in Ward 99 has troubled the residents to no end. A street which is a part of the old town is narrow and the Corporation digging the road had further reduced the moveable space, rues R. Nagarajan, a resident.

The Corporation had dug the road more than a month ago as a part of the ₹ 442 crore project to provide underground drainage service to 14 wards that comprise the added areas Kurichi and Kuniamuthur.

Mr. Nagarajan said that after digging the road to build manholes and lay pipelines, the Corporation had suspended the work, forcing the residents to tip-toe on the narrow road. And, given the road width, the residents could only walk around and not take out their two-wheelers.

He also said that a couple of children who were playing on the street slipped and fell into the pit.

J. Daniel, a civil activist, said the Coimbatore Corporation had similarly suspended work on Kurumbar Street, Murugar Kovil Street and a couple of other areas and restored the roads only after the residents took up the issue with the officials concerned.

In this case, though it had been around 40 days and the residents had taken up the issue with the officials, the Corporation was yet to complete the work.

The residents were left with little choice but to protest if the Corporation further delayed the work, he added.

Sources in the civic body said the work was delayed because of the delay in the return of migrant labourers who had moved out during the lockdown period and added that the Corporation would restore the road at the earliest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mvz1cn/article32767188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB05TRENCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/residents-want-corporation-to-restore-road-at-earliest/article32767189.ece

247,2020/10/04,"Kavundampalayam, Vadavalli residents to get more water by November","Residents in Kavundampalayam, Vadavalli and Veerakeralam will have something to cheer about by November this year as the quantity of drinking water they receive is likely to double.

The residents’ are likely to see an increase from 75 litres per capita a day (lpcd) to 135 lpcd as the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board will commission the Kavundampalayam-Vadavalli drinking water augmentation scheme, say sources familiar with the project.

The increased water supply will bring the residents on a par with the residents of the core city – 60 wards.

The board has completed around 80% of the work to tap additional water from River Bhavani bed near Nellithurai. By October it will complete the ₹32.3 crore project that will help the residents get 11.5 million litres a day (MLD). It had already completed the ₹108.16 crore Kavundampalayam-Vadavalli drinking water supply augmentation scheme that draws 6.52 MLD water from the Ramakrishnapuram master balancing reservoir (over-head water tank) on Sathyamangalam Road.

Three added areas

The addition of 18.02 MLD to the 10.48 MLD that the residents have been getting under the old Kavundampalayam-Vadavalli scheme and 3.18 MLD that the residents get under the Siruvani scheme takes the total water that they will get to 31.62 MLD, which is more than twice the water supply that the residents are getting at present, the sources say and add that the water supply improvement project will directly help 2.56 lakh persons in the three added areas – Kavundampalayam, Vadavalli and Veerakeralam.

And, this 31.62 MLD will take care of the residents' need till 2036, they add.

As a part of the water supply improvement project, the board has also widened the width of pipes supplying water to 26,659 houses in the aforementioned areas so that they get adequate water and at good pressure at that, the sources add.

Sources in the Coimbatore Corporation say there were another 25,000-odd houses and other establishments that are waiting for new water connection, which the civic body will issue in due course.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/kavundampalayam-vadavalli-residents-to-get-more-water-by-november/article32763062.ece
248,2020/10/04,Indian Premier League 2020 | Tripathi holds out hope: Morgan,"All praise for his Russell-like approach

For Eoin Morgan, Rahul Tripathi’s cameo was a ‘huge positive’ for Kolkata Knight Riders in the 18-run loss to Delhi Capitals in Sharjah on Saturday.

Coming in at No. 8 in his first match, Tripathi hit a 16-ball 36 to keep KKR, chasing 229, in the contest until the last over.

“When he (Tripathi) bats down the order and produces something like that, it is a huge positive,” Morgan said. “To score at a strike rate of 250-300, it’s almost Andre Russell-like. The argument would be, why wouldn’t you keep him where he is when he does such a positive job.”

Morgan downplayed ‘impact’ player Sunil Narine’s failures as an opener.

Morgan, who scored an 18-ball 44 batting at No. 6, defended the decision to send him behind Russell. “When he (Russell) comes up, everybody shifts down. We went from a position of being behind the eight ball, because Delhi bowled well, to a position of strength and looking like winning it,” he said.

Morgan said KKR should stick to the basics. “Going back and looking at the execution of our yorkers, wide yorkers, length balls, bouncers and being honest about how we did today and how we need to move forward and learn is important,” he concluded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5wuwtx/article32767057.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05TRIPATHI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-tripathi-holds-out-hope-morgan/article32767058.ece
249,2020/10/04,Indian Premier League 2020 | ‘Stokes will change Royals’ formation’,"Coach McDonald says that Lomror did a fantastic job against RCB

Rajasthan Royals won its first two matches and lost the next two. The successive defeats, at the hands of Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore, have put Steve Smith’s men on the backfoot.

The addition of arguably the world’s best allrounder — Ben Stokes — could well lift the team’s morale. The Englishman, who is already in the UAE, is expected to be available for Royals’ match against Sunrisers Hyderabad on October 11 after he completes his quarantine.

“Stokes will change the formation of our eleven,” Royals coach Andrew McDonald said. “We have to pick the right team at the right time. That’s the real challenge.”

McDonald, however, ruled out changes in the top-order. “(We have) Jos (Buttler) and Steve at the top and Sanju (Samson) coming in at three,” he said. “The best players getting the most number of balls gives the best opportunity to win games.” McDonald said the side’s fielding needed to improve.

“Just when we were building pressure against RCB, it was released by some poor fielding.”

He said the players were putting in their best. “Sometimes there are errors and we have to minimise them in all three departments.”

The Royals coach said Mahipal Lomror did a fantastic job against Kohli’s men. “We backed him to bat in the middle-order and it worked.”

He didn’t seem concerned about the form of senior players Robin Uthappa and Jaydev Unadkat. “They are quality players,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/e3tqoz/article32767041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04LOMROR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-stokes-will-change-royals-formation/article32767042.ece
250,2020/10/04,"Indian Premier League 2020 | Watson, du Plessis put Kings XI Punjab to the sword","The duo’s 181-run stand helps CSK snap a three-match losing streak; Rahul, Pooran’s efforts in vain

Shane Watson (83 n.o., 53b, 11x3, 3x6) and the in-form Faf du Plessis (87 n.o., 53b, 11x4, 1x6) pummelled Kings XI Punjab into submission to lead Chennai Super Kings to a thumping 10-wicket win at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.

Chasing Kings’ competitive 179-run target, CSK emerged victorious with 14 balls to spare and snapped its three-match losing streak.

Relief, finally

The three-time champion will finally be relieved to have Watson back in form after a sedate start to the tournament. The Australian looked in good touch from the beginning, leaning into drives and clearing the in-field with ease.

At the other end, du Plessis cut loose when he went after Chris Jordan, hitting him for four boundaries to help CSK finish the PowerPlay with the score reading 60. The duo did not allow the left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar and leggie Ravi Bishnoi to settle, employing the sweep shot effectively to find boundaries at will.

Watson then hit three boundaries and a six in quick succession to race towards his first half-century of the season. He welcomed Jordan back into the attack with two consecutive boundaries to get to the mark, while du Plessis got to his three balls later. They went on to stitch together a 181-run association — CSK’s highest for any wicket in the IPL — to flatten the Kings.

Earlier, K.L. Rahul once again led from the front with a half-century (63, 52b, 7x4, 1x6) to help Kings XI Punjab post 178. He was assisted by some brutal hitting from Nicholas Pooran at the back end of the innings – a 33-run cameo off just 17 balls (1x4, 3x6).

Laying the foundation

Electing to bat, Rahul and Mayank Agarwal laid the foundation for a challenging score with a 61-run opening-wicket stand. Rahul was not at his fluent best but still produced some glorious cuts and drives when allowed to free his arms.

After being watchful in the middle overs, Rahul launched into Shardul Thakur in the 15th over, scoring 14 off it to get to his half-century.

At the other end, Pooran went berserk, hitting a four and six off Jadeja’s final over, before picking two more maximums of Curran and Bravo. Shardul, however, removed both Pooran and Rahul off successive deliveries at the start of the 18th over, helping keep the target within CSK’s reach.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/y24ads/article32767967.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CSKKBjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-kings-xi-punjab-vs-chennai-super-kings-in-dubai/article32766017.ece
251,2020/10/04,"Indian Premier League 2020 | de Kock, lower order and Boult do it for Mumbai Indians","Sunrisers Hyderabad run out of steam after Warner’s half-century as the chase fizzles out

Openers Quinton de Kock and David Warner scored maiden fifties for Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad in this edition, but it was the performance in the death overs — with bat and ball — that proved decisive in the IPL clash between the two teams at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Sunday.

de Kock’s 67 (39b, 4x4, 4x6) and valuable contributions from the big-hitters — Kieron Pollard, going berserk at the back-end helped Mumbai Indians amass 208 for five against an attack missing the injured Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Despite Warner’s maiden fifty of the season (60, 44b, 5x4, 2x6), an on-song pace troika of Mumbai Indians meant Sunrisers’ chase fell apart in the latter half.

With Mumbai Indians conceding just 80/5 in the last 10 overs at the high-scoring venue meant that Sunrisers could trudge to 174 for seven, the first sub-200 total of the season at Sharjah. At the halfway stage, at 94 for two, Sunrisers was on course to make it yet another thrilling finish.

Mini-battles

However, Trent Boult and James Pattinson won mini-battles against their national counterparts to seal the fate of the game. Left-armer Boult’s tennis-ball bounce coerced his Black Caps captain Kane Williamson into an edge in the 13th over. When Pattinson won the all-Australian battle against Warner in the 16th, courtesy a diving effort by Ishan Kishan at short third-man, the game was all but over.

Jasprit Bumrah then proved too hot for the inexperienced lower-order, which resulted in a comfortable win.

Earlier, de Kock’s knock ensured that Chris Lynn will have to keep cooling his heels. Had Manish Pandey not dropped a regulation catch off leggie Samad at long-on in the seventh over, de Kock’s (on 16) and MI’s misery would have compounded. MI could have been reduced to 52 for three. Once he was let off, de Kock set the platform for the Pandya brothers and Kieron Pollard to finish on a high.

Despite Pandey’s stunning effort to dismiss Ishan Kishan in the 15th, the last six overs saw 74 runs being scored, with Krunal hammering Siddarth Kaul for 20 runs off the last four balls.

252,2020/10/04,Indian Premier League 2020 | Virat Kohli’s RCB up against Shreyas Iyer’s Delhi Capitals,"Both DC and RCB have looked solid so far and are placed atop the standings with three wins out of four games each.

A back-in-form Virat Kohli’s tactical acumen will be put to test against Shreyas Iyer’s unassuming but dynamic brand of captaincy when the two most impressive teams of the ongoing IPL — Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Capitals — face each other in Dubai on Monday.

Both DC and RCB have looked solid so far and are placed atop the standings with three wins out of four games each.

While Iyer has shown great form in his team’s four matches, Kohli finally got his act together in RCB’s last game against Rajasthan Royals, striking a fluent half-century.

On Saturday, Iyer (88 not out off 38 balls) again showed his class after Prithvi Shaw’s (66) opening act as Delhi beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 18 runs.

Kohli too finally got his touch back after three ordinary outings with an unbeaten 72 off 53 balls to guide RCB to a comfortable eight-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals.

And come Monday, the two skippers would look to lead from the front and outwit each other in what promises to be a thrilling contest.

While Shaw has so far looked quite in control at the top of the order for DC, Shikhar Dhawan’s form would be a cause of concern for Iyer.

But on the brighter side, Delhi seem to have finally got Rishabh Pant back in form as he dusted off his rustiness with a quick-fire 17-ball 38 against KKR.

To add to it, there is Marcus Stonis and Shimron Hetmyer waiting in the wings.

On the bowling front, Kagiso Rabada is the go-to man for DC even though he leaked runs against KKR the other day.

South African pacer Anrich Nortje has been brilliant for DC in the opening and slog overs and bowled a brilliant penultimate over against KKR on Saturday.

Harshal Patel, as Ishant Sharma’s replacement, did well enough to finish with 2 for 34 in 4 overs but the fit-again Ravichandran Ashwin and Stoinis went for runs.

RCB, on the other hand, have been served well by the young Devdutt Padikkal at the top. The left-hander, considered the next big thing in Indian cricket, is fourth in the run-scorers’ tally with 174 from four games, including three fifties.

And if Aaron Finch too gets going, it would be difficult for any side to stop the marauding Bangalore openers.

Kohli’s return to form is a relief for RCB’s batting unit, which also has the likes of the in-form AB de Villiers, Shivam Dube and Gurkeerat Singh among others.

Isuru Udana has been a welcome addition in RCB’s bowling line-up along side Navdeep Saini and the spin duo of Washington Sundar and Yuzvendra Chahal.

But Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa is yet to adjust to the conditions.

RCB would also be hoping for Chris Morris to recover quickly after the South African all-rounder picked up a side strain before the start of the tournament.

Squads:

Royal Challengers Bangalore: Virat Kohli (c), AB de Villiers, Parthiv Patel, Aaron Finch, Josh Philippe, Chris Morris, Moeen Ali, Mohammed Siraj, Shahbaz Ahmed, Devdutt Padikkal, Yuzvendra Chahal, Navdeep Saini, Dale Steyn, Pawan Negi, Isuru Udana, Shivam Dube, Umesh Yadav, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Washington Sundar, Pavan Deshpande, Adam Zampa.

Delhi Capitals: Shreyas Iyer (c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw, Shimron Hetmyer, Kagiso Rabada, Ajinkya Rahane, Amit Mishra, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ishant Sharma, Axar Patel, Sandeep Lamichhane, Keemo Paul, Daniel Sams, Mohit Sharma, Anrich Nortje, Alex Carey (wk), Avesh Khan, Tushar Deshpande, Harshal Patel, Marcus Stoinis, Lalit Yadav.

253,2020/10/04,"IPL 2020 | I am not a gifted player, it’s all about hard and smart work: Shreyas Iyer","Iyer hit 88 off 38 balls with six sixes and seven fours in Delhi’s 18-run win over KKR in an IPL game here.

Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer has attributed all those big sixes against Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday to the enormous “hard and smart work” that he had put in the gym sessions as he doesn’t consider himself a “gifted player”.

Iyer hit 88 off 38 balls with six sixes and seven fours in Delhi’s 18-run win over KKR in an IPL game here.

“I know the hard work and the smart work I have put in through my gym sessions, so I wouldn’t say I am a very gifted player,” Iyer said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

“It was really necessary for me to take time at the start which I did in the earlier games as well. It was the right time for me to take on the bowlers and then rotate strike as well after that. Luckily it worked out for me. We keep talking about close victories and this was one of them. Really satisfied with the way everyone stepped up,” Iyer said.

Losing captain Dinesh Karthik rued missing out on a couple of sixes in the middle overs that probably cost them the match, according to him.

“Maybe in between 10-13 overs we didn’t get many boundaries, we lost a couple of wickets as well which sets you back in such run chases.

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Sunday said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will launch a mega anti-air pollution campaign on Monday following a meeting with departments concerned.

At a meeting of NCR states with Union Environment Prakash Javadekar recently, Mr. Rai asked the Centre to take time-bound action to ensure that 11 thermal power plants and more than 1,900 brick kilns using outdated technology in the national capital region control their emissions.

There are 11 plants around Delhi — in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab — which were supposed to retrofit their units with technology called flue-gas desulphurisation to reduce emissions by December 2019.

Mr. Rai said there are more than 1,640 such brick kilns in Uttar Pradesh, 161 in Haryana and 164 Rajasthan.

“All these contribute to Delhi’s air pollution massively,” he said.

The Minister said the Delhi government presented its plan to tackle stubble burning in the city during the meeting with Mr. Javadekar.

He said a center is being set up in Kharkhari village in Najafgarh where “bio-decomposer” solution will be prepared in around 400 containers starting Tuesday.

The new technology involves a liquid formulation prepared using bio-decomposer capsules, fermenting it over 8-10 days and then spraying the mixture on crop residue to ensure speedy bio-decomposition of the stubble.

Capsules worth ₹20 can effectively deal with 4-5 tonnes of raw straw per acre.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/envyxk/article32701639.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KEJRIWAL-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/arvind-kejriwal-to-launch-mega-anti-air-pollution-campaign-on-october-5/article32765360.ece

256,2020/10/04,Woman raped in Gurugram's DLF Phase-II; 4 arrested,"When she resisted, they beat her up and smashed her head against the wall causing injuries, says police.

A young woman was allegedly gang-raped by four men and brutally beaten up causing head injuries in DLF Phase-II in Gurugram in the early hours of Sunday. All the accused, including three delivery boys, have been arrested.

One of the accused met the woman near Sikanderpur metro station late on Saturday night and the two then walked to the office of a realtor on Bougainvilla Marg. “When the woman reached the house, she found three men were already present inside. The four then allegedly took turns to rape her. When she offered resistance, they beat her up and smashed her head against the wall causing injuries,” said Assistant Commissioner of Police, DLF, Karan Goyal.

The four left the women inside the house and fled. A team from the local police station took her to a nearby private hospital for the first-aid after the security guards in the area called the Police Control Room around 1 a.m. She was then taken to Civil Hospital and later referred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. The woman is stable and able to talk.

As many as 2,258 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the Capital in the past 24 hours taking the total number of cases to 2,87,930, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Saturday.

Also, 34 more deaths have been reported, taking the total number of deaths to 5,472. Of the total cases, 2,57,224 people have recovered and there are 25,234 active cases.

Beds available

Of the total 15,840 beds available for COVID-19 treatment in the city, 62.1% were vacant, as per government data on Saturday.

But 58.21% of the ICU beds with ventilators have been occupied and 67.06% of the ICU beds without ventilators are full.

The positivity rate (percentage of people testing positive for every 100 tests done) was 5.7%, which is lower than September. The overall positivity rate till now is 8.9%. The number of containment zones in the city on Saturday jumped to 2,658. The number of people admitted to hospitals, active cases and persons under home quarantine have decreased for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Only 39,306 tests were done in the past 24 hours.

“There was a time when Delhi was second number [in the country in terms of the number of cases] but now it is in the sixth number,” Health Minister Satyendar Jain said.

“We had increased the testing on a large scale and had said the cases will decrease in two to three weeks and now it has started to come down. At a time, the positivity rate was around 9-10% now it is less than 5.5%,” the Minister said, adding that more beds are available now.

261,2020/10/04,‘No home quarantine for most passengers arriving in Capital’,"Many of them say there were no follow-up calls from govt.

Several persons — who have travelled to Delhi from other States — and officials from at least three of the Capital’s 11 districts have told The Hindu that domestic travellers are not being put under 7-day home quarantine as directed in June 3 order.

Travellers, who arrived in the city by road or by air, said they did not get any follow-up phone calls from the government. There are other States where home quarantine for domestic travellers are still being implemented strictly.

“I came back to Delhi in August and no one took down my details at the airport. After that, the government did not contact me for quarantine,” said Sanakan Venugopal, who travelled from Kerala.

Another 25-year-old man said he too did not get any calls from government after travelling by air to the city. “After the landing, they did not even check my status on the Aarogya Setu app. Last week, one of my colleagues of travelled to his hometown by air from Delhi on Friday. After three, he came back to the city to join work. There was no quarantine,” he added.

An order by Chief Secretary of Delhi, Vijay Dev, on June 3 read: “All asymptomatic passengers who enter/de-board in NCT of Delhi shall home quarantine themselves for 07 days. The District Magistrates shall ensure that the passengers residing in their jurisdiction remain in home quarantine for 07 days [sic].”

‘Order not implemented’

A District Magistrate said: “Though the June 3 order is the last order we received on quarantine for domestic travellers, it’s not being implemented at this point. We do not get any list of travellers from the airport or the railway station.”

Officials from two other districts also gave similar responses.

According to the order, lists of travellers were supposed to be sent to each of the 11 districts by different departments so that the travellers could be quarantined and checked later.

The situation is not the same in other States. For instance, if a person has to travel to Kerala from any another State, she has to register in a government website before going and undergo mandatory home quarantine period and is contacted via phone by officials. For a short visit, which has to be less than a week, also the person has to register on the website but there will be no quarantine in this case. But there is no such system in Delhi.

A 27-year-old woman, Anukriti, said: “I came to Delhi from Uttarakhand on August 10 by car with a friend. Our names were not noted down and I did not undergo home quarantine.”

Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department of Safdarjung Hospital, said home quarantine and monitoring help prevent the virus from entering a State or city in the early stage of the infection. “Right now, it will help to an extent, but it is not feasible to implement it in a city like Delhi where lakhs of people travel to the city every day,” Dr. Kishore said.

The government spokesperson refused to offer a comment on why the order is not being implemented and whether they plan to revoke the order. Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/no-home-quarantine-for-most-passengers-arriving-in-capital/article32764528.ece
262,2020/10/04,"Hathras stir: Dalit activists seek judicial probe, fast-track courts","Organisations gather at Jantar Mantar to protest atrocities against Dalit women

Dalit Shoshan Mukti Manch (DSMM) and other organisations gathered at Jantar Mantar on Saturday to protest against the atrocities meted out to Dalit women in Uttar Pradesh and demanded a judicial inquiry into the cases. They have also demanded more fast-track courts as well as security for the Hathras victim’s family.

Sunaina K. of DSMM said: “A series of cases have been reported in the past few days. Atrocities against Dalit women is a norm in U.P. now. The manner in which the bodies were brutally assaulted and the horrific death of the victims show how they were denied basic rights. Even the manner in which the police have acted and the protection been provided by the government has remained suspicious.”

“We demand a speedy judicial inquiry into all the cases. Suspension of officials is only a means to calm down the agitated masses and suppress the public outcry. We need justice to be provided to the families. Caste factor has to be reported and discussed as well. We also demand safety and security of the Hathras victim’s family,” said Ms. Sunaina.

Demanding fast-track courts, Vinnita Shikhar, president of the Mahila Dakshata Samiti said, “Every day there is news about atrocities against women. Why aren’t there fast-track courts in the country and why are the accused not punished swiftly? We want capital punishment for rapists and fast-track courts should ensure that the death penalty is awarded swiftly.”

Students protest

Scores of students and others also joined the protest in solidarity.

Kanay Mathur, a first-year student studying at a university abroad, said: “This is the first time I am participating in a protest. It is high time that we acknowledge that casteism and sexism are both a huge part of this country. We should step out and not remain silent anymore.”

Kabir Beotra (17), also a first-time protester, said: “The incident, which took place in Hathras, is really disgusting. Also, the manner in which the Yogi Adityanath-led government handled the case is even more shameful. It is ironic that an actor’s death is given more importance and Dalit voices are drowned.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/r25zwv/article32764517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03LEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hathras-stir-dalit-activists-seek-judicial-probe-fast-track-courts/article32764518.ece

265,2020/10/04,"A month after resumption, Delhi Metro yet to catch up","Line utilisation figures reach 9-10 lakh per day as opposed to 55-60 lakh journeys before the COVID-19 pandemic, ridership sees a steady rise

Nearly a month after resumption of services, line utilisation on the Delhi Metro network has reached only 9-10 lakh daily, as opposed to the approximately 55-60 lakh journeys that the network was recording before the COVID-19 outbreak, according to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).

Line utilisation is the measure by which the number of journeys, performed by each passenger in completing his or her journey by using one or more lines, is recorded.

Metro operations were halted on March 22 due to the pandemic following which operations remained suspended for over five months. The nearly 400-kilometre long Delhi Metro resumed services in a graded manner with staggered timings from September 7.

Ridership on the network and line utilisation data provided by the DMRC have seen a steady rise.

On September 11, when the entire network apart from the Airport Express Line was operational, the DMRC recorded a ridership of 1,79,457 with a corresponding line utilisation of 3,28,968 and on September 12, when the entire network became operational, a ridership of 2,00,607 was recorded with a corresponding line utilisation of 3,80,720. Between September 12 and September 18, the line utilisation increased to 7,46,071.

Curtailed capacity

While officials said that the line utilisation figures have reached 9-10 lakh per day, with a curtailed capacity inside coaches to maintain social distancing, the number of journeys being undertaken currently are way below the pre-pandemic numbers.

In the first week of March, the number of journeys on the Delhi Metro network ranged between 55-60 lakh per day.

Discontinuation of tokens, restricted entry to stations, wearing of masks at all times, alternate seating inside metro coaches are some of the guidelines that were put in place by the public transporter. As a precautionary measure, the DMRC also introduced facilities by which commuters can recharge their smart cards online at the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) gates.

‘Break the Peak’

With certain sections recording an uneven ridership, the DMRC has also advised commuters to “Break the Peak” and stagger their journeys to avoid crowding.

“In recent days, it has been observed that certain sections of the metro network are showing a trend where occupancy is touching the 100% mark during monitoring and evening peak hours. Whereas, during off-peak hours, the occupancy in the same sections is in the range of 30%-50% only, leaving ample scope for the people to stagger their travel from peak hours to the extent possible and have hassle-free travel with social distancing in place,” DMRC officials said.

However, despite a strict protocol in place, several commuters continue to be apprehensive of taking the metro amid the ongoing pandemic.

Ahana Dasgupta, who was a daily commuter to Central Secretariat before the lockdown said, “I have not yet started travelling on the metro because I believe that in an enclosed space, the chances of getting infected increases manifold with a general unwillingness to wear masks. Further, in the evenings, there is a long queue outside the station where there is hardly any social distancing.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/utj0l3/article32763237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03DELPRIYADELHIMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a-month-after-resumption-delhi-metro-yet-to-catch-up/article32763238.ece

They see Him as the very state of enlightenment and jnana attained through renunciation, vairagya, devotion and concentration, etc. The Earth resting on His tusks appears as a lotus plucked and held by a sporting elephant from the waters of a lake The rishis beseech the Lord to place aside the earth, His consort and the Mother and abode of all beings so that they can pay obeisance to both of them.

273,2020/10/04,"Fed up with regular fights, woman murders husband","Walks into a police station and confesses to the crime

Fed up with her husband’s regular drinking and frequent fights, a 35-year-old woman killed him using a knife in the wee hours of Sunday at Thimmaipally in Jagtial district.

The woman later walked into the police station and confessed to the crime, police said.

The accused, Alakunta Laxmi, along with her husband Alakunta Laxman (40), a daily-wage earner, and their two daughters were living with her parents at Thimmaipally for the past four years.

According to police, Laxman used to come home drunk and pick up altercations with the woman and her parents frequently.

The couple got married 17 years ago and had two daughters aged eight and 14 years, police said.

For the past five years, she was living with her parents, as she was unable to bear the domestic violence by Laxman and his parents.

On Friday evening, he hit his mother-in-law, who suffered a severe head injury and was hospitalised.

The next day, villagers tied and confined him in the Gram Panchayat office.

“Somehow he managed to escape on Saturday night and tried to kill Laxmi, who took him back to the GP office and stabbed him. Later, she slit his throat,” Korutla Circle Inspector K. Rajashekar Raju said, quoting Laxmi’s statement.

After killing her husband, Laxmi went to the Korutla police station around 8 a.m. and surrendered, and narrated the incident.

“She also accused Laxman of molesting their elder daughter, who is now living with her aunt in Fakir Kondapur in Ibrahimpatnam mandal,” Mr. Raju said, adding that the allegations are yet to be verified.

274,2020/10/04,Centre allots ₹280 crore for police reforms in city,"Kishan Reddy appreciates police for bringing services closer to people

Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy said on Sunday that the Central government has earmarked funds for the ‘Safe City’ project in eight major cities across the country for surveillance, protection of women and rapid criminal investigation. As part of it, ₹280 crore has been allotted to Hyderabad, he said.

Addressing a gathering after dedicating the Amberpet assembly constituency’s CCTV network to the DCP’s office at Amberpet, he said that the city is expanding daily, with a wide range of activities, as well as crimes. Hence, it was imperative to use the currently available technology and CCTVs for the protection of people.

Mr. Kishan Reddy appreciated the police for bringing services closer to people using the latest technology and observed that the upcoming Raksha National University in Gujarat approved by Parliament would bring about key changes in the functioning of the country’s police system.

“The National University of Forensic Sciences Bill, approved by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, would enable students enrich themselves in law, criminology and other related disciplines, as well as excel in forensic science research. Women will get 33% reservation in all police wings,” he said.

275,2020/10/04,‘People of all ages susceptible to COVID’,"Transmission, severity of disease and risk of death depends on extent of exposure, says IIPH director

It is a misnomer to think COVID-19 kills only the older populations as people of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection like any other respiratory infections like influenza. As people age, their immune system response is lowered and they have more chances of conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, cardiac disease, which increases risk of death, say public health experts as the pandemic rages on with no signs of let-up.

“Some people age faster (biological age) compared to their actual chronological age due to frailty. Frail people or those with co-morbidities have higher risk of severe disease and death. Therefore, a significant proportion of COVID-19 deaths are in the elderly. Irrespective of age, the transmission of COVID-19, severity and risk of death depends upon how much of the virus the person is exposed to,” explains Public Health Foundation of India’s (PHFI) Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH)-Hyderabad Director G.V.R Murthy.

The infectious dose required to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is low because people have never been exposed to it before.

So, children and younger adults — more active and mobile compared to adults have a high chance of contacting adequate infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 either at play, school or work.

Dr. Murthy says for most of the younger population the immune system responds rapidly to fight the virus invasion and successfully blocks more severe disease. However, underlying unknown or undetected health conditions may be present among the younger people, which increase the risk of death, he warns.

Exposure to a high infectious dose can lead to a higher viral load which also increases severity. It only means all age groups are susceptible to COVID-19 infection, but most youths show milder infections so recover faster compared to the elderly where even with a lower infectious dose, a more severe infection is observed. More severe the infection and the lower the person’s immunity, greater is the risk of death.

Behaviour a factor

People’s attitudes and behaviour contribute significantly to the increased transmission and doubling rates of infected persons. Recent evidence which has looked at doubling times in nine countries including India shows that the doubling time is significantly affected by preventive measures taken and large gatherings also impacts the doubling time adversely.

Since health, social and economic development go hand-in-hand and one affects the other, ‘empathetic development’ is the way forward. “We have seen opening the metro has not lead to a sudden spike in cases because steps have been taken to enforce people to behave properly. Study after study has reiterated face masks should be considered a useful low-cost device along with social distancing and hand hygiene,” says IIPH State chief, who had worked with World Health Organisation (WHO) and was UNAIDS Consultant with National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).

Mask measure

Masks should now become a ‘fashion statement’ since studies reveal early termination of social distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave. Yet, if greater than 70% of population uses ‘safe’ masks properly, it can lead to cessation of transmission, he insists.

This data should be effectively used to educate people and change their behaviour and for governments to mandate safe measures and strictly enforce them. ‘Safe’ mask is one that’s worn properly, cleaned (if reusable) and used as long as people are outside their homes or in offices and disposed off in a closed bin/ bag.

Lockdowns reducing physical contact between individuals outside the house have a limited role as most transmission is within the confines of a house, adds Dr. Murthy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/v0ilcy/article32767266.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04-COVID19PEOPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/people-of-all-ages-susceptible-to-covid/article32767267.ece
276,2020/10/04,Farming with faith in the rain god,"Ratnamma and her husband grow a variety of rain-fed millet crops every year

Byagari Ratnamma, a farmer in 40s, cultivates about four acres of land on the outskirts of Tekur village. She has planted about 25 varieties of millet crops including bobbarlu, togarlu, anumulu, korralu, taidalu, ulavalu, gongura, nuvvulu, gaddi nuvvunlu, pesarlu and minumulu.

During the months of April and May every year Ratnamma and her husband Tuljaram till their land with tractor as it would be very difficult to for bullocks to till the land spread with rocks, literally. They remove the rocks, weed, and start cultivation. They have been doing it for the past two-and-half decades or so. A major portion of the farm land in and around the village is full of rocks and it is a routine for them every year.

Surprisingly, there is no irrigation for them to cultivate all these crops and they are completely dependent on rains. Then how do they cultivate so many crops? Leaving their fate completely to nature and rain, they continue their job. Rain god has never ditched them. Always they happily take some crops home and the yield is more than sufficient for them to sell after keeping a portion for their consumption.

When there is no irrigation why do they cultivate so many crops? They have a right answer with them.

“We trust mother earth and rain god. Both of them are always with us and have blessed us. Out of the 25 crops we cultivate, at lest 15 crops give sufficient yield and thereby we will be on the safe side. Not only that, we sell the surplus yield and meet our expenditure,” Ms Ratnamma told The Hindu.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ff06kq/article32767227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY05TEKUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/farming-with-faith-in-the-rain-god/article32767228.ece
277,2020/10/04,KCR shedding ‘crocodile tears’ over Pothireddypadu: BJP,"State party chief pens ‘open letter’ to Chief Minister

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of “shedding crocodile tears” on the Andhra Pradesh government trying to take the lion's share in Krishna waters through the Pothireddypadu lift irrigation scheme and questioned why he did not send a single communication to the Centre on the contentious project till date.

Party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar in an ‘open letter’ to the Chief Minister, a copy of which was released to the media on Sunday, charged Mr. Rao of trying to shift the entire blame on the Centre on the sharing of Krishna river waters whereas he had actually “forged a secret understanding with AP Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy” on the issue.

Objecting to the contents of the letter written by Mr. Rao to Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Shekawat, Mr. Sanjay Kumar questioned the timing of the communication when the Apex Council meeting has been scheduled to be held in the next few days.

“The letter is full of lies and falsehoods. It is only meant to divert people's attention to cover up for the TRS government’s failure to safeguard the legitimate water rights of Telangana,” he charged.

The BJP leader, also Karimnagar MP, charged that despite being warned, Mr. Rao did not react when the AP government had called for tenders for raising the capacity of the Pothireddypadu irrigation scheme as had a ""tacit pact"" with AP CM due to their common objective of calling for big project tenders only to “benefit the contractors”.

In fact, it was his letter to the Centre objecting to the new proposal to increase the capacity of the lift irrigation scheme that the Apex Council meeting has been called for and this too Mr. Rao ensured was postponed, allowing the tenders to be finalised in the meantime, claimed Mr. Sanjay Kumar.

He demanded Mr. Rao to “confess” about the pact with AP CM on accepting 299 TMC for TS and 512 TMC for AP when it was actually entitled to 555 TMC of Krishna water. The Centre is anyway duty bound to implement the verdict of the tribunal and the Supreme Court orders on this issue, hence both CMs should desist from their respective “duplicitous stances and mislead the Telugu people”, said the party president.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tyy9v8/article32766996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY05BANDISANJAYKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kcr-shedding-crocodile-tears-over-pothireddypadu-bjp/article32766997.ece
278,2020/10/04,Consumer forum rules in car owner’s favour,"Mahabubnagar Collector, forest official directed to pay ₹3.21 lakh hire charges, ₹25,000 compensation

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum – Mahabubnagar directed the Mahabubnagar District Collector and Forest Settlement Officer to jointly pay ₹ 3.21 lakh as hire charges for a car and another ₹ 25,000 as compensation to complainant who said that he was not paid after offering his services.

The Forum, with president M Anuradha and member K Venkateshwarlu, was dealing with a complaint filed by K Anjaneyulu (38), a resident of Mahabubnagar town, who said that his car was hired by forest settlement officer for ₹ 24,000 per month for a period of one year from April 3, 2017. The complainant claimed that hire charges were not paid for a year despite the vehicle being used on several occasions, even as several payment reminders were made.

The complainant also said that whenever payment requests were made, he was told that bills which were sent to the Treasury were pending approval. He also alleged that he was given advance receipts stating that these would be credited to his bank account, but this did not happen. He further alleged the pattern continued for a year. This, he said, caused him monetary losses and humiliation. Later, the complainant sent a notice demanding that the issue be settled, but this was allegedly was not done.

The Forum noted that both respondents had chose not to respond to notices sent to them. It also stated that keeping the documents placed on record, it is clear that the office of the forest settlement officer had entered into an agreement with the complainant, and that ₹ 3,21,750 is due to him.

279,2020/10/04,"Tougher Prelims exam with focus on history, economy","‘Paper designed to reject and reduce candidates to a manageable number instead of testing knowledge’

With increased focus on history and economy, the Civil Services Preliminary test conducted on Sunday was designed for elimination process more than testing the knowledge of aspirants.

While the test covered all areas mentioned in the syllabus, the questions had a specialist orientation rather than the expected generalist orientation, according to civil service exam trainers. Many candidates have expressed the view that they found no cause and effect relationship in their preparation and their performance at Paper-I. “It is evident that the paper was designed to reject and reduce the candidates to a manageable number rather than test any knowledge relevant for a prospective administrator,” said V. Gopalakrishhna, director of Brain Tree, while analysing the paper.

General Studies Paper-I, which determines merit, was held in the morning and General Studies Paper-II, popularly known as CSAT, which is of a qualifying nature, was held in the afternoon.

In a statement, Rambabu, a teacher at La Excellence, said there was less emphasis on current affairs this time and the focus shifted to traditional areas. He opined that Paper-II was very tricky and geography questions were “tremendously increased” compared to last time. Questions from history and environment were a bit difficult while those from polity and economy were relatively easier.

As the question paper was tougher, the cut-off marks can be expected to be much lower this time, around 100. The results are likely to be released in November.

Aspirants were of the opinion that the Union Public Service Commission, which conducts the test, should review the style of questions and the pattern as the present system was only useful as a gatekeeper. Many feel too much is left to chance and there is no direct cause and effect relationship.

This year 52,934 aspirants had applied from two centres in Telangana — Hyderabad and Warangal. From the twin cities, there were 46,171 applicants who appeared for the test at 99 centres.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/c78fyu/article32766432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY05UPSC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tougher-prelims-exam-with-focus-on-history-economy/article32766433.ece
280,2020/10/04,BJP plans awareness drive on farm Bills from booth level,"‘New Acts will put an end to middleman control’

State president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar has reiterated that the Narendra Modi government at the Centre has brought in the three new Acts only as part of its plans to double the farmers’ income over the next couple of years.

Speaking to mediapersons through video conference on Saturday he stated that the new laws were purely aimed at the welfare and development of the farming community. They would also put an end to the middlemen’s control over prices by enabling the farmers to sell their produce anywhere they want or wherever they get a good price.

In spite of all the hard work in crop production withstanding the unfavourable weather conditions, pest and insect attacks and other adversities, the farmers had no right to fix the price for their produce. However, after the enactment of the new laws they would have a considerable say in deciding the price for their produce, Mr. Sanjay Kumar stated.

As the new Bills bring in more traders before the farming community for purchase of their produce at their farm the chances of farmers getting better price would increase and the transportation charges of taking their produce to markets would also be saved for them.

‘Blind opposition’

Further, the new laws would provide for purchasers entering into agreement with farmers on procuring their produce at a pre-fixed price.

Line-up of traders to rural areas would also increase employment opportunities at village level. Even if farmers take their produce to markets outside their market committee area they would not be required to pay any cess as per the new laws, the MP said.

However, some political parties, including Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), were opposing the new laws blindly and trying to mislead the farming community on them. The BJP was preparing an action plan to explain benefits of reforms in the agriculture sector from polling booth level. Round-table meetings would also be convened at mandal and district levels to create awareness on the new laws among people, particularly the farming community, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bjp-plans-awareness-drive-on-farm-bills-from-booth-level/article32764590.ece
281,2020/10/04,SCR new division put on the back burner,"Proposal still under consideration, says Railways Minister in Parliament

On every Gandhi Jayanti, the South Central Railway (SCR) also celebrates its anniversary. Celebrations are low key generally and the raging pandemic ensured it remained so this year too. Yet, the 54th anniversary is special since the zone has remained intact and is likely to remain so for sometime to come.

If things went according to the political landscape prevailing a couple of years ago, the SCR would have been cut down to size with three of the six zones - Vijayawada, Guntur and Guntakal to be joined to the proposed South Coast Railway (SoCR) with Visakhapatnam as the headquarters.

Ambiguous stance

“If it happens, the SCR will have its hands and legs cut off leaving just the torso as it would have just Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Nanded divisions,” commented a senior official. However, as things stand now, the formation of the new division has been put on the back burner although the Railways Ministry continuous to maintain an ambiguous stance.

For instance, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal said that the proposal was still under consideration to a question raised in Parliament, and to another question, he said there was a plan to reduce the number of divisions from the existing 17!

Doubts arise as the Indian Railways has already unleashed a frenetic set of reforms, including a major restructuring in the functioning, with the Railway Board itself cut to size to four from eight and a new management cadre about to be unveiled.

OSDs posted out

Secondly, two very senior officials appointed as Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to oversee the transition phase of the formation of the new zone, and cutting the SCR to size have been posted out in the last couple of years. Vijayawada divisional railway manager is holding it as an additional charge these days giving sufficient hints about priority of the issue.

The Indian Railways is already battling crises brought about by COVID-19 with limited number of passenger trains and huge dip in revenues this year although there is a concerted effort to give a push to the freight trains taking advantage of the relatively free lines, point out senior officials.

SCR formation had its own twist and turns after it came into being in 1966 on October 2 when Hubli and Vijayawada divisions of the Southern Railway, and Sholapur and Secunderabad divisions of Central Railway were carved out and merged into a new zone. Later, Guntakal division of the Southern Railway was also merged with SCR in 1977 and Sholapur division was remerged with the Central Railway.

Secunderabad division was further split into Secunderabad and Hyderabad divisions in 1978. Again in 2003, two new divisions like Guntur and Nanded were operationalised transferring Hubli division to newly formed South Western Railway.

Forming the key link between North and South India, the zone used to have more than 700 passenger trains travelling up and down with another 100-150 freight trains, senior officials said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/scr-new-division-put-on-the-back-burner/article32764594.ece

The district administration has ordered the Ernakulam Rural police to probe whether a beauty pageant held at a private resort near the Kochi airport recently violated physical distancing norms and the COVID-19 protocol.

District Collector S. Suhas made this public in a post on his official Facebook page that also carried a picture of the event. The image showed the purported winner of the pageant being kissed on both cheeks by two other participants, who probably emerged runners-up.

“At a time when the pandemic is raging, close interactions as shown in the image and violation of COVID protocol were improper. The message conveyed by such images could detrimentally affect the general alertness of society,” the post read.

K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) said details of the event were being collected to verify whether there was any violation of physical distancing norms and the COVID-19 protocol. Further action will be taken as soon as a complaint is received, he added.

The event was organised by a private company on September 30. “The picture was captured just a moment towards the end of a two-hour-long event. Except for that, we have complied with the protocol, and video evidence has been submitted to the police,” said Jabitha Ajith, managing director of the company.

288,2020/10/04,Aggrieved mother declares temporary truce,"Vows to launch legal fight; wants independent board to find truth behind child’s death

Nandini Rajan, the mother of a three-year-old boy who died reportedly following complications of swallowing coins, called off her 35-day-long protest demanding justice, in the wake of the District Collector’s prohibitory orders that kicked in on Saturday and after the Scheduled Caste (SC) Development Department offered her a temporary job, besides legal, medical, and educational support.

Ms. Rajan, belonging to the SC community, suspended the protest, albeit temporarily, after SC Development Department Deputy Director Joseph John met her at the protest venue in the presence of Aluva MLA Anwar Sadat on Friday evening.

The child had died on the night of August 2 even though he was rushed to three different hospitals — Aluva Taluk Hospital, Ernakulam General Hospital, and Alapuzha Medical College — during the course of the day.

Ms. Rajan started her indefinite dawn-to-dusk strike in front of the Aluva Taluk Hospital in a show of lack of faith in the forensic report, which attributed the death to an acute asthmatic condition called status asthmaticus and not necessarily due to the swallowed coins. Forensic experts had also cited the child’s history of pneumonia, though Ms. Rajan shot it down, claiming that it was a long time ago, and that at the time of the death, the child was fit as a fiddle and alleged medical negligence as the reason for the death.

“I will resume my protest, if need be, and in the meantime, I will launch a legal fight for justice. It is now two months since my baby died, and I want an independent medical board to find the truth behind it,” said Ms. Rajan who was indisposed for a while following the rigours of the protest.

She is about to file a writ petition in the High Court next week. Her lawyer Sunil C. Kuttappan had applied for relevant documents, including forensic and post-mortem reports, from the Revenue Divisional Officer, Fort Kochi.

“The writ will challenge the post-mortem report and pray for an independent medical board while pointing out many slip-ups in offering timely health care,” said Mr. Kuttappan.

The SC Development Department has offered to bear the legal expenses if Ms. Rajan is unsatisfied with the findings of the medical board formed by the Health Department. SC Department Director P.I. Sreevidya has assured to intervene on behalf of the aggrieved to include her name in the list of beneficiaries under the LIFE Mission for the homeless.

“The department will bear her already incurred and future medical expenses and give her a temporary job at our exam training centre at Aluva, since we are not authorised to make permanent postings. She could also avail of the training courses at the centre in pursuit of a permanent job,” said Mr. John.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/aggrieved-mother-declares-temporary-truce/article32763326.ece
289,2020/10/04,Augmented water supply system launched at Kadamakudy,"All households in the panchayat to have water connection

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated an augmented drinking water supply system benefiting residents of Kadamakudy, Chariyamthuruthu, Kothad, Pizhala and Cheriyakadamkudy islands as part of the ‘Jala Jeevan’ programme for drinking water supply in the State.

The project with fresh pipelines to meet new capacity requirements and to augment the system was completed using ₹12 crore from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Board (KIIFB). It will help meet the drinking water requirements of the islands close to the Ernakulam mainland up to 2036, the Chief Minister said.

Kadamakudy residents will get water from the Periyar, treated at the Muppathadam plant. A new pipeline was laid to ensure that residents of islands neighbouring Kadamakudy also enjoyed the benefits of the project.

A total of 446 families will soon get house pipe connections for drinking water supply under the Jala Jeevan programme. The project is expected to turn Kadamakudy into a panchayat where all households will have water connection.

The augmented water supply project was completed in eight months. Of the 4,545 households in the panchayat, 4,099 have already been given house connections for drinking water supply. Twenty-two public taps too have been set up. The remaining 446 households will get house connections soon, Mr. Vijayan said. A total of ₹48 lakh has been allocated for completing house connection work.

While the Chief Minister inaugurated the water supply system from Thiruvananthapuram, S. Sarma, MLA, unveiled a plaque at the Kothad KKP Sabha Hall to mark the occasion.

Staff from the Department of Urban Affairs, who had participated in the process of picking reserved seats for the local body elections, had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 recently, necessitating that he go into quarantine, the letter says. The Additional Secretary of the corporation is set to retire soon and has gone on leave.

Deputy Mayor K.R.

291,2020/10/04,‘Dracula’ gives cops nightmares,"Accused, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, escapes custodyfor the third time

An accused nicknamed ‘Dracula’ after the titular character in Bram Stoker’s Gothic horror novel is literally giving cops nightmares.

Named so for his ability to stealthily break into homes and pull of thefts without even waking the occupants, Suresh aka Dracula Suresh, fled the police custody on Saturday, which, incidentally, was his third in the past ten days since his arrest on September 22.

After testing positive for SARS-COV-2, the accused, known for violent behaviour when the police close in for capture, was moved into the psychiatric cell at the Government Medical College, Kalamasserry, on September 30. On Saturday, around 10.30 a.m., he managed to escape through a crack on the overhead roof, and like the families in the houses he target, police guards outside had no clue whatsoever.

Dracula’s hide-and-seek with cops started on the night of September 23 when he was first nabbed and brought to the jail department’s detention centre at Karukutty where the accused are temporarily put up till their COVID test results are available before being sent to prison. Those testing positive are sent to the first-line treatment centre (FLTC) at the convention centre of the Kochi airport.

He fled using the cover of night the moment his handcuffs were unfastened. Though Dracula drew first blood, cops managed a strong comeback by arresting him within 24 hours from a house at Vengola near Perumbavoor.

No sooner than cops locked him up in the same detention centre and heaved a sigh of relief on September 24, Dracula returned the favour by escaping within 24 hours, this time with a co-accused.

He ended up in police custody the very next day while attempting a break-in. Only this time, it took him a week to leave cops with egg on their face yet again.

He had 20-odd cases against his name, including two registered by the Angamaly police for recent escapes from the custody.

Lack of facility

Already, exasperated policemen bemoan the lack of a dedicated facility for keeping the ones testing positive among the arrested.

The FLTC at Kochi airport has far too many exits for the liking of the police who have to keep an eye on the accused from afar owing to the pandemic protocol.

“The Aluva jail was vacated and all the inmates were moved to Mattancherry and Kakkanad jails to turn the former into an exclusive facility for accused testing positive. But till day not a single positive case has been admitted there,” said M.V. Sanil, district secretary (Ernakulam rural) of the Kerala Police Association.

In the meantime, cops have launched yet another hunt for Dracula, who is having the last laugh, at least for the time being.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/dracula-gives-cops-nightmares/article32763223.ece
292,2020/10/04,Penalty breather likely for corpn. and five municipalities,"Failure to comply with solid waste management rules

The Kochi Corporation and Kalamassery, Aluva, Angamaly, Thrikkakara and Thripunithura municipalities may be relieved from paying up the total environment compensation of ₹25.4 crore for their failure to comply with the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, at the solid waste processing plant in Brahmapuram.

Instead, the environment compensation will be assessed for non-compliance from April this year onwards based on the population in each local body as suggested in an order dated July 3, 2020 by the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The compensation of ₹13.31 crore assessed by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board for the Kochi Corporation was for a duration of 618 days starting from November 22, 2018 to July 31, 2020.

The corresponding figures of ₹2.77 crore for Kalamassery, ₹1.72 crore for Aluva, ₹1.96 crore for Angamaly, ₹2.92 crore for Thrikkakara, and ₹2.72 crore for Thripunithura were arrived at based on the environment compensation for 480 days from April 9, 2019 to July 31, 2020.

A meeting convened by the Chief Secretary in Thiruvananthapuram on September 22 to discuss the follow-up action to be taken on the basis of the tribunal’s directives recommended that the compensation might be assessed based on the population criteria specified in the NGT’s order on July 3 and it might be deducted directly by the Finance Department from the account of the local bodies. The Kochi Corporation will have to pay ₹5 lakh per month from April onwards as per the formula while the five municipalities will have to pay 1 lakh only per month as environment compensation. The corporation’s assessment will be ₹25 lakh for non-compliance from April 1 to September 30 while it will be ₹5 lakh each for the five municipalities.

The continuing lack of clarity in estimating environment compensation for erring local bodies violating provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, saved them from paying up higher penalty.

On the Brahmapuram case, the Local Self-Government Department pointed out that it was advisable to go with the compensation regime fixed by the National Green Tribunal instead of the assessment procedure evolved by the Central Pollution Control Board. There was no definite provision for calculating the compensation and it could be challenged in legal forums by local bodies, whereas the compensation directed by the tribunal would be binding, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/penalty-breather-likely-for-corpn-and-five-municipalities/article32763219.ece
293,2020/10/04,Chellanam residents unhappy over coastal protection project,"Chief Minister has only listed ongoing projects, says forum

Chellanam residents are ‘disappointed’ that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s announcement of a bunch of projects to protect Kerala’s coast did not hold anything new for the coastal village that has borne the brunt of severe sea erosion, made more severe since the Ockhi cyclonic storms hit the village in December 2017.

“The Chief Minister has only listed the projects that are ongoing. Work on geotube bags as temporary sea walls has been an utter failure,” said a spokesman for Pachima Kochi Theera Samrakshana Samiti on Saturday after the Chief Minister unveiled a ₹200-crore programme for coastal protection.

He said that even the project to build new breakwaters off Kannamaly and Malakhappadi coastal segment was an old one. “Contractors are not taking up the project despite the work being tendered,” he alleged.

Residents have called for a comprehensive long-term package of measures to protect their lives and property. The coastal segment between Fort Kochi and South Chellanam saw sea erosion and flooding during the first two weeks of August as the rain intensified.

Kochi Janakiya Vedhi too expressed its disappointment with the Chief Minister’s announcements. “It is an attempt to create a delusion even as elections to local bodies are around the corner,” said a statement issued by Vedhi leaders here.

The statement said that Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma had expressed the opinion that geotextile tubes were not effective enough for coastal protection. Despite that the Chief Minister highlighted works being done using the same technique, they said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pvft3w/article32763210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-KI-CHELLANAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/chellanam-residents-unhappy-over-coastal-protection-project/article32763211.ece

295,2020/10/04,Traffic diversion at Palarivattom from Sunday,"Vehicles to take U-turn on either side of the flyover to cross the junction

Traffic on Civil Line Road that links Ernakulam with Kakkanad will be diverted through a pair of U-turns on either side of the Palarivattom flyover from Sunday morning, as part of safety measures being introduced while reconstructing the damaged parts of the structure.

Simultaneously, the area beneath the flyover’s central span, which was being used by vehicles will be closed using barricades. This is to ensure safety of motorists when the deck, girders, and pier caps of the structure are dismantled and rebuilt, the traffic police said.

Vehicles from the city proceeding to Kakkanad will have to turn left from the Palarivattom NH Bypass Junction and take the first U-turn to cross the junction. Similarly, vehicles from Kakkanad proceeding to the city must turn left from the junction and use the first U-turn to proceed further, the traffic police said in a press release.

Aimed at avoiding congestion at Palarivattom, light vehicles coming to the city from Kalamassery could avoid the junction by opting for the Seaport-Airport Road-Eachamukku-Palachuvadu-Vennala-Puthiya Road-NH Bypass stretch.

Vehicles from Edappally can use the Edappally-Thripunithura Road, which runs parallel to the NH Bypass, to reach their destinations, the police said.

They added that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS), the stakeholders engaged in reconstructing the flyover, would have to repair potholes on alternative roads used by motorists, in case the PWD and the Kochi Corporation did not repair them. This will be crucial, since several portions of Puthiya Road are pothole-ridden. A major bottleneck on Seaport-Airport Road-Vennala stretch will be Vennala Junction, which is even otherwise bottlenecked due to extremely narrow bellmouths on its northern and southern sides.

Residents associations and others have been demanding a total ban on parking in the vicinity of the flyover and on service roads of the NH Bypass nearby, to ensure safe and streamlined flow of vehicles when the flyover is rebuilt.

More portions will be barricaded and tall nets erected when concrete cutting extends to more areas atop the flyover, to safeguard against debris and dust falling on motorists and pedestrians. Water, used while cutting, too may fall on them if barricades are not in place, officials said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/uz7ff0/article32763150.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-KI-PALARIVATTOM-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/traffic-diversion-at-palarivattom-from-sunday/article32763149.ece
296,2020/10/04,Coronavirus | Post-pandemic stress mistaken for cardiac issues,"Most patients who are consulting cardiologists in fact need counselling, says doctor

A pounding heart — giving the sense of an imminent heart attack or other cardiac problems — is making people consult specialist doctors through video calls. Cautioning that only detailed examinations and diagnostic reports can help doctors diagnose the actual cause of the problem, a cardiologist said that stress and anxiety, triggered by various reasons, could give a sense of an abnormal heart rhythm.

A senior consultant cardiologist at KIMS Hospitals in Hyderabad, B. Hygriv Rao, cited the case of a 25-year-old man from Chhattisgarh who complained of palpitations. He had no cardiac issues before and was otherwise healthy.

“This young man’s lifestyle represents the new normal. He works from home, rarely goes out, is off socialisation and reads COVID-19 statistics on the Internet. It didn’t take me long to realise he had no cardiac problem and needed reassurance and a few days of medication for his anxiety,” the cardiologist said.

When a patient with a complaint consults them, doctors check their background, lifestyle, information on vitals and ECG reports, to know if the patient is suffering from cardiac arrhythmia or heart problems, or if it was just a false alarm induced by stress and anxiety. Consulting a doctor helps to know the reason behind the abnormality.

Job insecurity, uncertainty about the future, financial distress, fear of contracting COVID-19 and other issues associated with it are some of the problems building up stress in people. Dr. Rao suggested that counselling by trained psychologists will help those suffering from such anxiety-induced problems.

He said there are two categories of COVID-19 patients who might genuinely suffer from cardiac problems. The first set of people are those with pre-existing cardiac issues which worsen after contracting COVID-19. The second are those who develop cardiac issues after getting the infectious disease.

However, there have been many cases of cardiac patients who contracted COVID-19 and have recovered in government hospitals in Telangana, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kzc6mg/article32767212.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TH-LT-COVID-19TESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-covid-19-stress-inducing-symptoms-of-cardiac-problems/article32766668.ece
297,2020/10/04,Coronavirus | Doctors stress on early identification and treatment of multi-system inflammatory syndrome,"Though only a small percentage of children who had recovered from COVID-19 can develop this syndrome, doctors stress on the importance of early diagnosis and treatment

Doctors of Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) said that around 10 children, who had recovered from COVID-19, had later developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) and were treated at the hospital. Though only a small percentage of children who had recovered from COVID-19 can develop this syndrome, doctors stress on the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.

S. Balashankar, the Head of the Department of Paediatrics at GRH, said that a small proportion of children could develop MIS-C after two to six weeks of recovery from COVID-19. The child might display symptoms like high fever, red eyes, rash, neck swelling, vomiting or diarrhoea, he added.

A doctor from the Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children in Chennai explained that MIS-C cases were initially reported in the western countries. “But, children with this syndrome are now identified in various parts of the State,” said the doctor.

Usually, children with MIS-C syndrome test positive for COVID-19 antibodies. “The level of antibodies in the children might have increased after being infected with COVID-19 or after being in contact with a COVID-19 positive person. But, the high levels of antibodies lead to an autoimmune reaction and the child develops multisystem inflammatory syndrome,” explained the doctor.

D. Rajkumar, the Chief of Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at GRH, said that this is a critical syndrome which could mainly affect the coronary arteries and lead to coronary aneurysm. The syndrome looks similar to Kawasaki disease, he added.

Dr. Balashankar said it could affect other systems including heart, liver, kidney or nervous systems. The treatment protocol for children will depend on the symptoms and severity of MIS-C. “Children are given steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin based on their severity. All the children with MIS-C syndrome that were treated at the hospital, which also includes patients referred from private hospitals, have recovered after complete treatment,” he said.

“Hence, early identification and prompt treatment of MIS-C are essential to prevent coronary aneurysm. If any child develops high fever, red eyes or other symptoms then parents must immediately take the child to the hospital,” said Dr. Rajkumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/g7hg91/article32417709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22-VJ-COVIDROUND-UP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-doctors-stress-on-early-identification-and-treatment-of-multi-system-inflammatory-syndrome/article32765461.ece
298,2020/10/04,The Hindu Explains | How did the National Institute of Nutrition arrive at the ‘ideal’ weight of Indian men and women?,"How do Indians compare internationally? What are the dietary recommendations?

The story so far: The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), the Hyderabad-based premier research body of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has released a new set of guidelines, updating norms on recommended dietary allowances (RDA), which is the average daily intake needed for a nutritious diet. Besides several other recommendations, a salient point in the report released this week is the upward revision of the ‘ideal’ weight of Indian men and women.

How are these reports prepared?

In 1989, an expert committee constituted by the NIN to decide on what should be a nutritious diet, used data generated by studying body weights and heights of well-to-do Indian children and adolescents. This was not reflective of the breadth and diversity of India. The reference weights for a man and woman were fixed at 60 kg and 50 kg respectively. Another committee in 2010 considered extensive data on anthropometry collected by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau, using nutrition profiles from ten States of India for computing reference body weights. They computed reference weights for different age groups. Most of the data collected were from rural India, but the reference points for a single ‘ideal’ weight remained unchanged. For the latest report, NIN looked at nationally representative data from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4, 2015-16), the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (2015-16), the World Health Organization (2006-07) and the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP, 2016) to “derive acceptable reference body weight values through the lifespan.” The definition for a reference Indian adult man and woman were modified with regard to age (19-39 years) instead of (20-39 years) and a body weight of 65 kg and 55 kg respectively were fixed for a normal Body Mass Index (BMI). Though termed ‘ideal’, it is more appropriately a measure of the average weight of Indians.

How do Indians compare internationally?

The reference weights are a proxy for the nutritional status of the people of a country. International comparisons find that the average Indian is lighter than his or her counterparts globally. The average Dutch male is 87.4 kg and a woman 72.3 kg, and the average weight in the United Kingdom is 86.8 kg for men and 72.9 kg for women, according to data aggregator ‘WorldData.info’. Indians are closer to typical weights prevalent in Asia. The average Sri Lankan male is 61.3 kg and woman 56.2 kg, and the average Japanese man is 69 kg and woman 54.7 kg. The data, however, is based on 2010 estimates, and the latest NIN revision will push India up a few notches.

What are the dietary recommendations?

The guidelines specify the amount of carbohydrates, minerals, dietary fibre, fats and oils, protein, and even water, that a person must ideally consume. The water intake for an adult man ranges from 32-58 ml per kg body mass, and for a woman, it ranges from 27-52 ml per kg body mass. For children, the requirement is over 60 ml per kg body mass, and for adolescent boys it ranges from 47-60 ml per kg body mass, while for girls, it is 39-49 ml per kg body mass. For a pregnant woman, based on the working intensity, the water required from beverages ranges from 2.1 litres to 3.2 litres per day. A minimum 400 gram/day of fruits and vegetables are necessary to obtain sufficient antioxidant nutrients, such as beta-carotene, Vitamin C, and certain non-nutrients like polyphenols and flavonoids that reportedly protect against chronic diseases. This should be complemented with a sufficient amount of vegetable oil to obtain Vitamin E. The fat intakes for sedentary, moderate and heavy activities have been set at 25 gram/day, 30 g/d and 40 g/d respectively for an adult man, and 20 g/d, 25 g/d and 30 g/d for adult women.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/px8bkb/article32762693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10MEALS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/the-hindu-explains-how-did-the-national-institute-of-nutrition-arrive-at-the-ideal-weight-of-indian-men-and-women/article32762697.ece
299,2020/10/04,The Hindu Explains | What does herd immunity mean for COVID-19?,"Why do scientists and experts say that it is not a viable option to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak?

The story so far: Right from the time it became obvious that the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak was not confined to China, but scaling other shores too, the theory of herd immunity has been floating around. Initially, herd immunity, an important tool in epidemic control, was proposed as a means to overcome the pandemic. Only a certain proportion of the population needs to be infected in order to stop large outbreaks, either through naturally-acquired disease, or through vaccination. Since a vaccine is not available for COVID-19 yet, some people advocated that the infection be allowed to spread in the community until herd immunity is achieved.

Why is this being stoutly opposed?

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is easily transmissible and would require around 60-70% of the population to be infected to acquire herd immunity.

Coronavirus | India still far from herd immunity: Harsh Vardhan

In the World Health Organization’s (WHO) ‘Science in 5’ video series, the organisation’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, explains herd immunity with the help of a common childhood infectious disease — measles — for which there is a very effective vaccine. “To achieve herd immunity in the population, for measles, you need about 95% of the people to have immunity or antibodies,” she explains. “Even if you have 5% of children [who are] not vaccinated, these others actually have enough protection in the population to prevent the measles virus from actually going from one person to the next. So, it is really like having a barrier of people who are protected, who break that chain of transmission.”

For the SARS-CoV-2, Dr. Swaminathan thinks that at least 60-70% of the population should have immunity to really break the chain of transmission. “If you allow this to happen naturally, it will take a long time, of course, but more importantly, it is going to do a lot of collateral damage,” adds Dr. Swaminathan. “So, even if 1 % of people who get infected are ultimately going to die, then this can add up to a huge number of people, if we look at the global population. And that is why we believe [that] it is not a good idea to achieve herd immunity by just letting the infection run wild in the general population and infect a lot of people. We should talk about herd immunity in the context of a vaccine,” she says.

Marc Lipsitch, Professor of Epidemiology and director, Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Harvard School of Public Health, responding on Twitter to the news of the White House’s new pandemic adviser recommending ‘herd immunity’, said: “This is simply wrong … Herd immunity is not a strategy or a solution. It is surrender to a preventable virus.”

Coronavirus | ‘Aiming for herd immunity without pharma interventions may have disastrous consequences’

How and when will herd immunity be achieved in this pandemic?

Arnaud Fontanet and Simon Cauchemez, authors of a recent Nature publication, ponder over this exact point: “Herd immunity is achieved when one infected person in a population generates less than one secondary case on an average, which corresponds to the effective reproduction number R (that is, the average number of persons infected by a case) dropping below 1 in the absence of interventions.” The publication says, “With flu pandemics, herd immunity is usually attained after two to three epidemic waves, each interrupted by the typical seasonality of influenza virus, and more rarely, by interventions, with the help of cross-protection through immunity to previously encountered influenza viruses, and vaccines, when available.” Currently, there is insufficient confirmed information on re-infection to determine how that will influence the pandemic’s course.

Comment | Imperatives after India’s September virus peak

What does the sero-prevalence study in India say?

A measure of the infection levels in the population is provided through the sero-surveys conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The second study was done between August 17 and September 22, 2020, and found the prevalence at 15.6% of the population in urban slums and at 8.2% in non-slum areas. The hotspots were not included this time. In Delhi, the second round estimated a sero-prevalence of 29.1%. The study revealed that for every reported COVID-19 case, there were 26-32 infections, down from 81-130 infections per reported case in May. It also said the susceptibility of a considerable section of people, who are still unexposed to SARS-CoV-2, exists, and the risk in urban slums is twice that in non-slum areas, and four times higher than the risk in rural settings. In Mumbai (study not by ICMR), the second-round estimated around 45% prevalence in slums and 18% sero-prevalence in non-slums.

Coronavirus | Immunity for lesser time, change in ‘virulence’ of virus, say experts on September sero-survey results

Are vaccines the solution?

The Nature paper argues that vaccines are particularly suited for creating herd immunity because “their allocation can be specifically targeted to highly exposed populations, such as healthcare workers or individuals with frequent contact with customers.” They may have a significantly greater impact on reducing viral circulation than naturally-acquired immunity, especially if it turns out that naturally-acquired protective immunity requires boosts through re-infections.

Dr. Swaminathan says, “With a vaccine you can achieve immunity and herd immunity safely. Through natural infection also we can achieve it at some point, but it would be at great human cost.” Meanwhile, until a vaccine is readied, it would be best to take actions that would slow down the progress of the virus — following COVID-19 etiquettes of wearing a mask, physical distancing and following hand hygiene — she adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/ip4o1g/article32762566.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10HERD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/the-hindu-explains-what-does-herd-immunity-mean-for-covid-19/article32762567.ece
300,2020/10/04,Piyush Goyal inaugurates Phoolbagan Station of Kolkata’s East West Metro corridor,"The start of Metro services at Phoolbagan Station is a “Durga Puja gift by the Railways for Kolkatans”, the Minister said.

Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday virtually inaugurated the Phoolbagan Station of Kolkata’s East West Metro corridor, describing the extension of the line from Salt Lake Stadium as a Durga Puja gift for the people of the metropolis.

Mr. Goyal also flagged off the first train from the new station to Salt Lake Sector-V, and said the entire stretch of the corridor is likely to be completed by December 2021.

I am told that by the end of next year, the entire East West Corridor project of 16.55 km (between Sector-V and Howrah Maidan) is expected to be completed; hopefully with no further hiccups coming up due to the Covid pandemic,” he said while inaugurating the extension of the line till Phoolbagan Station through the virtual mode.

Mr. Goyal said the project, which has suffered delays owing to several issues, has been fast-tracked since 2015 because of the personal intervention and monitoring by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The start of Metro services at Phoolbagan Station is a “Durga Puja gift by the Railways for Kolkatans”, the Minister said.

“The estimates are that this line (East West Metro corridor) will be used by nearly 10 lakh people by 2035. That itself will be a huge service to the people of Kolkata,” he said.

Mr. Goyal said though the project was sanctioned in July 2008, very little work had commenced till 2015.

“There were problems of land acquisition, resettlement issues, and then the state government made us change the alignment; all of these resulted in huge delay and cost escalation,” he said.

Work on the East West Metro corridor was also disrupted due to an accident caused by an aquifer burst in Bowbazar area in central Kolkata during drilling operations in August 2019.

The first phase of the project, a 4.88-km stretch connecting Sector-V and Salt Lake Stadium, was inaugurated by Mr. Goyal on February 13.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/slkich/article30736184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EASTWESTMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/piyush-goyal-inaugurates-phoolbagan-station-of-kolkatas-east-west-metro-corridor/article32765483.ece
301,2020/10/04,Plan to build temporary bird shelters near Sambhar Lake,"Rajasthan govt. sanctions ₹1.80 crore for the nurseries

The Rajasthan government will build temporary shelters for migratory birds near the famous Sambhar Lake before this year’s winter season, when a large number of avian guests from the cold northern regions of Central Asia are expected to arrive at the country’s largest inland saline water body.

More than 20,000 migratory birds had died due to avian botulism in the lake last year.

The Rajasthan High Court, which took suo motu cognisance of the mass death, has also constituted a seven-member expert committee to study the impact of salt forming and identify any illegal salt mining in the lake.

The State government informed the High Court earlier this week that it had sanctioned ₹1.80 crore for creating temporary nurseries near the lake. A Division Bench said if more funds for creating an infrastructure for safety and security of birds were required, the State could seek the Centre’s support.

The Bench, headed by Chief Justice Indrajit Mohanty, asked the expert committee to carry out investigation and scientific study and make its recommendations in a sealed cover to the court within four weeks. The State government’s Forest Department will bear all the expenses for the committee and also pay an honorarium to the experts nominated to the panel. The members include Wetlands International South Asia vice-president Ajit Pattnaik, Bombay Natural History Society’s assistant director P. Sathiyaselvam and former Rajasthan Chief Wildlife Warden R.N.

302,2020/10/04,Protests against farm laws continue,"Punjab farmers are blocking rail tracks and staging sit-ins at petrol pumps, toll plazas and malls

Punjab farmers’ protest against the Centre’s new farm laws continued on Saturday as they squatted on rail tracks for an indefinite period. The agitating farmers also raised slogans against the government and said that the stir will go on till their demand for revoking the new laws was not accepted.

A total of 31 farmers’ bodies have joined hands to step up their agitation. They had announced to block rail tracks from October 1 for an indefinite period.

The farmers have blocked rail tracks at many places including Dhablan (Patiala), Sunam (Sangrur), Budhlada (Mansa), Gidderbaha (Muktsar), Barnala, Bathinda, Faridkot, Gurdaspur, Rupnagar, Phillaur, Samrala and Moga.

Farmers under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee have been squatting at rail tracks in Amritsar and Ferozepur since September 24.

According to Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal, besides blocking rail tracks at 33 places, farmers have also staged sit-ins outside 24 petrol pumps, nine toll plazas, four shopping malls, a thermal power plant and a foodgrain godown belonging to some corporate houses.

Boycott call

The farmers have also given a call to boycott some corporate houses and their products in the State. According to them, the Centre wants to “benefit” a few corporate houses with the “black laws”.

‘Dharnas’ were also being staged outside the houses of five BJP leaders, including former Punjab BJP chief Shwait Malik.

In Ferozepur, women have also joined farmers who have been agitating at a rail track near Basti Tankan Wali. At Amritsar, protesting farmers burnt the effigies of the government.

In Phagwara, police prevented the farmers from moving towards the residence of Union Minister Som Parkash.

The protesters wanted to ‘gherao’ the residence. Police personnel, led by Superintendent of Police Manwinder Singh, stopped the farmers about 200 meters away from Mr. Parkash’s residence.

Barricades placed

Barricades were put at all the entry points to stop the farmers from going towards the Minister’s residence, said the farmers. Later, the farmers staged a sit-in on the road.

Addressing the protesters, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal claimed that the agitation against the anti-farm laws has now snowballed into a mass movement.

He said farmers were not averse to holding talks with the Centre if the invitation for the same comes from the Prime Minister’s Office. “We will not accept any leader from the Punjab BJP for talks, as we are boycotting them,” he said.

The Punjab unit of the BJP had constituted an eight-member committee to reach out to farmers to apprise them of the benefits of the new laws. Farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre’s farm reforms would pave way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.

President Ram Nath Kovind had given assent to the three contentious Bills — the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and the Farm Services Bill and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/wlu70w/article32763230.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE04BLOCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/protests-against-farm-laws-continue/article32763231.ece

306,2020/10/04,Small-scale traders find the going tough amid tight regulations,"A majority of wards in Kozhikode Corporation are now containment zones

With the stringent enforcement of COVID-19 rules subsequent to the declaration of prohibitory orders, the struggle of small-scale traders who have been fighting for months to overcome lockdown blues has aggravated. Those who earned a living by working in such shops are now finding it hard to cope with the unexpected situation.

Efforts to launch online service delivery are yet to be successful in the case of many small-scale traders in the city. Some are facing legal action apart from the suspension of their trade licences on the charge of COVID-19 protocol violations.

“We are not trying to challenge any official protocol by endangering public safety. Some of us do it out of our helplessness to survive the crisis by other means,” says Abdu Rahiman, a trader on the S.M. Street. He says that the existing regulations will have to be reworked in such a way to ensure better support to the community.

Merchant association leaders say containment zone regulations are literally leading to the closure of all major shops, which were not included in the list of essential services. Within the Kozhikode Corporation limits alone, the majority of the wards are now containment zones, which predicts bitter days ahead. They add that some possible amendments in the existing rigid regulations, including in the permitted working hours, will help the struggling traders to survive.

‘No communication’

“For example, there is no proper communication from the authorities to make traders actually aware of containment zone regulations. No proper instructions are given to them in advance other than some sudden public directives. Many are struggling with the blanket ban on shops which were casually labelled as inessential,” says K. Sethumadhavan, secretary of Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti (KVVES).

According to KVVES functionaries, the plight of traders on the S.M. Street is beyond words. “The majority of the shops fall under the essential service category and traders are unable to function now. Hundreds of workers are jobless with a looming crisis in the sector,” they say

Meanwhile, Quick Response Team members, who oversee the implementation of the health protocol, say there is a very dangerous situation prevailing now in the district with the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and no relaxation can be entertained for at least a month. Like traders, many are going through challenges and it is time to put such individual concerns aside for a big safety cause, they add.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/7yen3f/article32767555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tvkzpolice,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/small-scale-traders-find-the-going-tough-amid-tight-regulations/article32767556.ece
307,2020/10/04,Anakkampoyil-Meppadi tunnel road project to be launched,"₹858-crore facility to be a milestone in Kozhikode’s development

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will announce the project launch of the proposed Anakkampoyil-Meppadi tunnel road on Monday.

The completion of the multi-crore project, which is estimated to cost ₹858 crore, will be one of the milestones in Kozhikode district’s development apart from realising its long-pending dream to have an alternate road to bypass the hairpin bends to Wayanad district.

Since prohibitory orders and COVID-19 regulations are in place, the launch event will be held online. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac and Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran will attend the online event along with the Chief Minister.

To mark the occasion, it will be screened live in Thiruvambady in the presence of 20 specially invited persons including Ministers T.P. Ramakrishnan and A.K. Saseendran. Entry of the public will not be allowed as part of efforts to comply with the rules.

Three-year work

The plan is to complete the mega project in three years. Konkan Railway Corporation Limited has been entrusted with the survey works, preparation of the Detailed Project Report and project implementation on turnkey agreement. The State government has also taken utmost care in the eco-friendly realisation of the project.

“The survey work is in progress now in the project area. It is going to be a big development leap for our district to have better connectivity with Wayanad district,” said Thiruvambady MLA George M. Thomas.

He said the actual cost of the project could be estimated only on completion of the ongoing survey.

It was in 2014 that a feasibility study of the innovative proposal was done by the government. In 2016, it was officially approved for further proceedings and survey works.

A few months ago, the State government accorded sanction to the estimate of ₹658 crore for implementation under the Kerala State Infrastructure Investment Fund Board.

Bridge to be built

Officials who prepared the preliminary estimate said the cost to complete one-km stretch of the proposed road alone would come around ₹150 crore considering the additional requirements. It would also include the cost of constructing a 70-metre-long bridge at Kundanthodu. The total length of the sub-terrain road would be seven kilometres.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/anakkampoyil-meppadi-tunnel-road-project-to-be-launched/article32767521.ece

The complex, spread over around 2.5 acres near Pooladikkunnu in Eranhikkal ward of the corporation, is being constructed at a cost of ₹1.45 crore. The sports complex constitutes courts for basketball, football and volley ball besides indoor facilities for kalarippayattu, boxing and yoga. In addition, there is a gymnasium, a gallery with a seating capacity of 500, a hall that can accommodate 100 people, kitchen, training rooms and toilets. The athletic track is under construction and will be completed before the inauguration in mid October.

The stadium was conceived by former minister A.C. Shanmughadas, when he was the MLA of the region, and is named after him. M. Radhakrishnan, Education and Sports Standing Committee Chairman of the Kozhikode Corporation, said that the Pooladikkunnu region was known for boxing while Perunthuruthi is known for football and volleyball.

This is the third mini stadium that is being constructed after the present council of the Kozhikode Corporation came into power in 2015. The other two, at Poolakkadavu and Eranhipalam, were completed within the last three years, at the cost of ₹1 crore each. Two other projects have been partially completed at Kinasseri and Vengeri. Meanwhile, the stadiums being planned at Cheruvannur and Beypore are facing technical issues.

310,2020/10/04,Centre urged to exclude inhabited villages from buffer zones,"Local bodies to pass separate resolutions

Grama panchayats sharing borders with the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary have decided to pass separate resolutions urging the Union government to exclude inhabited villages from the proposed buffer zones. The Kozhikode District Panchayat and the Kattippara grama panchayat have already made the call through their resolutions.

Leaders of Karshaka Raksha Samiti, a coordination committee of farmers in the proposed buffer zones, said Chakkittappara, Koorachundu, Panangad and Puthuppadi panchayats would pass their resolutions soon in support of the farmers’ cause. Such resolutions will be crucial in registering the position of various local bodies on the issue, they added.

A samiti coordinator said the Forest Department’s assessment of the existing geographical area of the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary was inaccurate in the absence of solid geospatial data. “If we go by their data, there are around 250 families still staying within the sanctuary. Chakkittappara panchayat will be the worst-hit if the proposed draft notification is implemented as such,” he added.

Samiti leaders also took strong exception to the “finding” of the Forest Department that there were no inhabited areas in Kattippara panchayat which was included in the proposed buffer zones. The finding was based on inaccurate geospatial data with no clear markings of the geographical coordinates, they claimed.

A number of other farmers’ organisations too have stepped in with similar claims about the department’s “unscientific” calculation of the sanctuary borders. According to them, the flaws in the marking of boundaries will again drag rural farmers into crisis with the final notification on ecologically sensitive areas.

To convince the Union government of the farmers’ apprehensions, some leading farmers’ action councils are also planning to send their leaders to hold talks with Union Ministers. They are now in touch with a few senior BJP leaders to finalise appointments.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/centre-urged-to-exclude-inhabited-villages-from-buffer-zones/article32763361.ece

The police said that the man, who was the driver for a BJP functionary, came back to Sattur on Saturday night.

He initially claimed that he was bundled into a car and the gun-toting men speaking Hindi, took him to Madurai. After getting him food, they blind-folded him and took him some 100 miles away to a farm in an unidentified place that looked like Theni district.

“They threatened me with dire consequences that I should not be working against the BJP. They also said that they need to teach a lesson to two more persons who were against the party,” he told the police.

The man claimed that he was later dropped in the district.

However, by this time, the Sattur town police had registered a case of abduction. A team led by the Sattur Deputy Superintendent of Police, S. Ramakrishnan, formed special teams to track down the “abducted” person.

Ten Inspectors of Police and 200 men had fanned out across the district and to the neighbouring districts to investigate the case.

The State Highways Department is carrying out maintenance work at the age-old Albert Victor bridge across Vaigai river, connecting the southern parts of Madurai with the northern parts, at a cost of ₹1 crore.

An official said the damaged road on the bridge was milled and a new road relaid during April during the lockdown. “We received several representations from the public, urging us to relay roads without increasing the existing height as two-wheeler riders tend to climb on to the pedestrian footpath during traffic snarls. So we removed two layers of the damaged road and a new metalled surface was laid in its place,” he said.

Bed protection works are under way. The steps under the AV bridge through which the Vaigai flows is also being revamped. The places where plastering is worn out are being replaced. “While 90% of the work has been completed, the remaining work will be finished by next week,” he said.

P.S. Srinivasan, a commuter, said the new surface did provide some respite for road users who had to endure hardship while travelling on the damaged road for long. “Previously they made only patchwork in a hasty manner on this bridge,” he said.

314,2020/10/04,Police reaches out to Kudankulam villagers,"In a move that is expected to bring the public and police closer, the district police won over the hearts of hundreds of families, especially the youth, when Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan gave an assurance in settling the cases registered against them in 2011 during the anti-Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant agitations.

The police had registered 248 cases then and after the State government had agreed to withdraw or close them, 213 were treated as closed. The remaining 35 cases were yet to be closed.

Following petitions submitted to the SP during the grievance meetings, he had proposed to hold a public hearing in the presence of the KKNPP officials and elected representatives.

When the meeting was held on Sunday, the villagers said that many youth in their hamlets who had opportunities to go abroad for work, faced hardships in obtaining NOC from the police as they were told about the cases pending against them since 2011.

While the State government had announced that the cases were closed, the police continued to reject applications which sought issuance of No Objection Certificate for obtaining passport and for other purposes.

Under such circumstances, the SP gave assurance that the police would give NOC to applicants against whom there were no cases. They would not be made to run from pillar to post. He also said that persons intending to go abroad for educational purposes too can get required certificates from the police. However, he categorically stated that the police cannot give any blanket assurance to all. The applications would be considered case by case.

For instance, if the nature of the complaint was serious, in such cases, the police cannot give NOC. The Koodankulam police were also told to be cordial with the applicants and he directed them to use their discretionary powers judiciously and settle issues amicably.

Radhapuram MLA Inbadurai, who was also present, thanked the police and district administration for their efforts in reaching out to the people. He said that the government had ordered for withdrawing the cases after the villagers were given assurance on safety and among other issues.

Some of the youth, who were present at the meeting, said that the police had dragged for months without issuing NOC when they had approached them. “For local jobs, where private entrepreneurs insisted on a certificate from the police, they directed us to go to the SP office for approval from the superiors...It is heartening to have the SP himself present in our village and give an assurance,” they remarked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/police-reaches-out-to-kudankulam-villagers/article32766474.ece

318,2020/10/04,Railway officials begin inspection of Pamban rail bridge,"A day after train services were suspended on Pamban rail bridge following an alarm raised by sensors over its stability, senior railway officials began inspection of the century-old sea bridge on Sunday.

Led by the Deputy Chief Engineer (Bridges), Southern Railway, Balasubramanian, the officials made trolley inspection of the bridge, especially the Scherzer’s span.

He was accompanied by Senior Divisional Engineer (Coordination), Mohideen Pitchai.

Mr. Balasubramanian said that he has just begun the inspection and refused to comment on the stability of the bridge. A senior divisional railway official has already said that trains, with passengers, would not be operated over the Pamban bridge as a safety precaution till the stability of the bridge was fully ensured.

Railway passengers who were to board the special train at Rameswaram railway station, were taken to Mandapam railway station by road for the second day on Sunday.

“The inspection is likely to continue for two more days,” a railway official said.

Southern Railway, in association with IIT-Chennai, had, in June, installed and tested, the working of Continuous Health Monitoring System for a round-the-clock monitoring of the stability of the structural member of the bridge.

Any variation in the stability of the bridge would be captured by the strain gauges installed there and give a real-time alert to the railway officials and IIT-Chennai team.

With Pamban being one of the highly corrosive environment, Railway officials have decided to replace the Pamban bridge with a new one, which is under construction.

“As a precautionary measure, trains are being run at a slower speed of 15 kmph on the bridge,” an official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/zctjlg/article32766292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA05INSPECTIONRMD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/railway-officials-begin-inspection-of-pamban-rail-bridge/article32766293.ece
319,2020/10/04,"Watch out for MIS-C, say doctors","‘A small percentage of children who have recovered from COVID-19 can develop this syndrome’

Ten children, who had recovered from COVID-19 but later developed multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), were successfully treated at Government Rajaji Hospital. Though only a small percentage of children who recovered from COVID-19 can develop this syndrome, doctors stress the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.

S. Balashankar, Head, Department of Paediatrics, says a small proportion of children develop MIS-C after two to six weeks of recovery from COVID-19. The child may display symptoms such as high fever, reddish eyes, rashes, neck swelling, vomiting or diarrhoea, he said.

A doctor from the Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children in Chennai explains that MIS-C cases were first reported in western countries. “But, children with this syndrome are now identified in various parts of the State,” the doctor says.

Usually, children with MIS-C syndrome test positive for COVID-19 antibodies. “The level of antibodies in the children might have increased after being infected with COVID-19 or after being in contact with a COVID-19 positive person. But high levels of antibodies lead to an autoimmune reaction and the child develops multi-system inflammatory syndrome,” the doctor says.

D. Rajkumar, the Chief of Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at GRH, says this is a critical syndrome which primarily affect the coronary arteries and leads to coronary aneurysm. The syndrome is similar to Kawasaki disease, he says.

Dr. Balashankar says it can affect other body functions, including that of heart, liver and kidney or nervous system. The treatment protocol for children depends on the symptoms and severity of MIS-C. “Children are given steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin based on the severity. All the children with MIS-C syndrome that were treated at the hospital, which also includes patients referred from private hospitals, have recovered after complete treatment,” he says.

“Hence, early identification and prompt treatment of MIS-C are essential to prevent coronary aneurysm. If any child has high fever, reddish eyes or other symptoms, their parents must immediately take the child to the hospital,” says Dr. Rajkumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/watch-out-for-mis-c-say-doctors/article32766255.ece

Police said that following complaints that the DMK cadre and functionaries organised ‘gram sabha’ meetings on Oct 2, despite the curfew, cases were registered.

The government had originally announced the conduct of gram sabha meetings on Oct 2 (Gandhi Jayanthi) across the State. However, after DMK president M.K. Stalin appealed to the panchayat presidents and the people to pass resolutions against the recently passed Farm Acts by the Union government, the State government cancelled the conduct of the meetings.

Officials claimed that the government had cancelled as a precautionary measure in view of the COVID-19 virus. Under such circumstances, the DMK cadre conducted the meetings in many districts on October 2, which came under the police scanner.

322,2020/10/04,GRH performs epilepsy surgery on two children,"The doctors of Apollo Speciality Hospitals in Madurai have successfully performed epilepsy surgeries for two children, who had refractory focal epilepsy, where medicines don’t help seizures to be under control.

S. Muthukani, consultant epileptologist at the hospital, said the children were monitored through video electroencephalogram (EEG). One of the children would get 100 to 200 seizures each day and the other child would encounter 10 to 15 seizures every day. “Medications did not help to control the seizures for both the children. But, after surgery, both the children have not faced any seizures,” he added.

India is one of the countries where prevalence of epilepsy is high. While 70% of the people can control epilepsy with anti-seizure drugs, the rest of the patients cannot control their seizures with medications. “There is a myth that epilepsy is not curable and that anti-seizure drugs are the only possibility to control epilepsy.

Biometric authentication

Under ‘One Nation, One Ration card’ scheme, cardholders are asked to ensure their identity by biometric authentication to receive their PDS supply from any fair price shop. Presently, the card holder or a representative can get the essential commodities by producing the smart card issued by the government. Then what is the necessity for an additional biometric authentication?

Fingerprints need a high-level security to prevent frauds. By stealing biometric information, a hacker may get access even to bank accounts. Moreover, during this pandemic, the card holders contracting COVID-19 is a possibility.

Considering the problems of the elderly and the potential abuse of personal information, additional biometric authentication should be avoided for receiving ration goods.

325,2020/10/04,NHAI starts filling potholes on NH 75 as rain subsides,"The affected stretches between BC Road and Melkar have been filled with bitumen mix

In the midst of the #RoadChallenge campaign by Youth Congress leader Mithun Rai exposing the poor highway network in Dakshina Kannada on his Facebook page gaining momentum, the National Highways Authority of India has commenced the pothole filling exercise on National Highway 75 after rainfall subsided.

When The Hindu visited BC Road-Melkar stretch of NH 75, the affected stretches were found to have been filled with bitumen mix even as bitumen mixing process was on near Panemangaluru Junction. Though the potholes and craters have been filled, the road surface has not been made even.

Mr. Rai launched the campaign about 10 days ago following a large number of road users decrying the sorry state of the highways connecting Mangaluru with the other parts of the State.

In his first of the several posts on September 25, Mr. Rai said, “#RoadChallenge, Let’s have this one as well #NitinGadkari. Mangalore is a land of Ports, an education hub, a city of IT companies and mega industries and many more. Mangaluru is the 2nd largest business centre in Karnataka. Around 75% of India’s coffee, timber and cashew nuts exports are handled by the New Mangalore Port. (sic)”

Continuing further, Mr. Rai said that almost all National Highways connecting Mangaluru are in pathetic condition and the city does not deserve to have such roads. Though this was brought to the notice of MP Nalin Kumar Kateel several times, he does not seem to understand and see any of these. He asked people to record videos and take pictures of bad highways and post on social media, #RoadChallenge tagging Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari.

326,2020/10/04,Processing unit seeks to handle chicken waste,"City corporation to take decision later this month

A private chicken waste processing unit at Baikampady here has come forward to collect, transport and process about 30 tonnes of chicken waste produced in the city daily.

It has approached Mangaluru City Corporation to hand over to it the waste for converting it into animal feed and also, oil used in soap manufacturing industry.

According to sources in the corporation, the council of the civic body will take a decision on handing over the waste to the unit, at its meeting later this month as such an arrangement can help save some funds being spent on solid waste management annually.

As per the seven-year solid waste management contractual agreement with Antony Waste Handling Cell Ltd., which is valid till January 2022, the latter will collect and transport the waste for the civic body now. The waste transported is deep buried in the Pachchanady landfill site.

Hence, the civic body cannot deny this waste to the same company as the payment to the company is being made on the basis of the quantity of solid waste collected by it. The corporation will have to hold talks with the company for diverting chicken waste to the unit at Baikampady and a solution will have to be worked out.

The council will discuss the two aspects before taking the decision.

Sources said that the corporation now spent between ₹ 3.5 crore and ₹ 4 crore annually for the collection, transportation and disposal of over 10,000 tonnes of chicken waste annually. If the unit at Baikampady is allowed to collect, transport and process the waste on its own, the civic body can reduce a part of its budget on solid waste management.

They said that two other major chicken retailers in the city with their own poultry farms have their own processing units for converting the waste into animal feed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/processing-unit-seeks-to-handle-chicken-waste/article32765868.ece

330,2020/10/04,SWR commissions state-of-the-art signalling system in ghat section,"This will enhance train handling capacity by 35%

More trains, passenger as well as freight, can ply between Hassan and Mangaluru with South Western Railway’s Mysuru Division commissioning a state-of-the-art signalling system between Yedakumari and Kadagaravalli stations in the Sakleshpur-Subrahmanya Road ghat section on Friday.

The new signalling system, a release from Mysuru Division here said, will enhance the train handling capacity by 35% on the section.

Mysuru Divisional Railway Manager Aparna Garg in August said that 20 trains could be operated through the section instead of the existing 13 in 24 hours, once the signalling improvement project was completed.

The new system will facilitate crossing of trains at Yedakumari and Kadagaravalli stations on the ghat stretch.

No train could enter the 55-km ghat section when another train was passing through earlier. The new system, however, facilitated movement of trains from both the directions with the provision of crossing at the two stations thereby enhancing the section capacity.

The release said the project with multi-section digital axle counter technology, was executed at a cost of ₹4.4 crore, funded by the Hassan-Mangalore Rail Development Company.

It also considerably reduces maintenance of track circuits in the inhospitable terrain of the ghat section. Restrictions on crossing of trains at the ghat section imposed by the Commissioner of Railway Safety, following non-availability of catch-siding at two stations, was the primary bottleneck to operate more trains to achieve higher productivity.

Starting in June, the work was executed amidst hostile conditions including COVID-19 pandemic, very heavy rains, fear of landslips while digging trenches to lay cables, lack of road connectivity to move equipment, using diesel generator sets for power, and many more.

As expected, it got over by September-end and was commissioned on October 1.

Mysuru Division’s senior divisional signal and telecommunication engineer D. Sreenivasulu led the team executing the project. Ms. Garg complimented the team for working steadfastly to complete the work in three months.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/hgh3q6/article32763073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGTRACKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/swr-commissions-modern-signalling-system-at-sakleshpur-ghat-section/article32763074.ece

332,2020/10/04,Indo-French satellites to trace illegal spillage of oil by ships: French space agency,"‘Parts of the satellites will be built in both the countries and launched from India’

The constellation of maritime surveillance satellites for the Indian Ocean Region, to be jointly launched by India and France, will be able to trace illegal spillage of oil by ships, a senior French space agency CNES official said on Sunday.

Also read: ISRO-CNES: taking the next steps together

In August last year, CNES and ISRO committed to developing and building a constellation of satellites carrying telecommunications and radar and optical remote-sensing instruments, constituting the first space-based system in the world capable of tracking ships continuously.

The monitoring centre will be based in India, the official added.

“With a revisit capability (of the satellites), this makes possible to task acquisitions several times a day. It will also be able to detect oil slicks and trace their origin,” the official said.

The main purpose of this is to trace illegal spillage of oil by ships. The Indian Ocean Region has several Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOC) and used by many ships every day.

The satellites will be operated jointly by France and India to monitor ships in the Indian Ocean.

The system will also cover a wide belt around the globe, benefiting a broad range of French economic interests, the official said.

Parts of the satellites will be built in both the countries and launched from India, he added.

CNES and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) are also operating a number of climate-monitoring satellites together.

‘Trishna’, a highly precise thermal infrared observer, will also be part of the fleet of Indo-French satellites.

After a successful design phase led by a joint team of ISRO-CNES, the satellite is now set to enter its development phases in the coming months, the official said.

“It will provide continuous thermal monitoring at high resolution, its unmatched capabilities serving precious applications ranging from sustainable agriculture to drought forecasting and monitoring of urban heat islands,” the official said.

France and India are also collaborating on the Gaganyaan, India’s first manned space mission.

333,2020/10/04,Save tax with the Sheltering Principle,"You should protect from tax, those investments that provide the lowest post-tax returns

It is better to have income and pay taxes than not have income. But it is important that you carefully plan your taxes. In this article, we look at how you can avail deduction of ₹1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act as part of your goal-based investments. The following discussion is based on the assumption that you choose the old tax regime.

Tax-efficient investments

Saving taxes on your goal-based investments helps you enjoy a better lifestyle. How? The higher the taxes on your goal-based investments, the lower the returns. And lower the returns, the more you have to save every month to achieve your goal. Therefore, tax-efficient investments will leave more money for your current consumption.

Therefore, it is important that you optimally use your Section 80C limit. What products should you choose to achieve your life goal and simultaneously exhaust the Section 80C limit?

For any goal that you pursue, your investment portfolio will have equity and bonds. Your equity investments will be typically through mutual funds (MFs) while your bond investments will be in bank fixed deposits (FDs) and recurring deposits (RDs). So, your equity investments predominantly earn capital appreciation whereas your bond investments earn only income return. This sets the stage for applying the Sheltering Principle to create tax-efficient portfolios.

The principle in question

You should protect (shelter) from tax those investments in your portfolio that provide the lowest post-tax returns.

Typically, income returns are taxed at a higher rate than returns from capital appreciation. Note that your equity investments will typically attract long-term capital gains because you are likely to hold the investments for more than one year; this is because you are investing to achieve a life goal which will have a typical horizon of more than three years.

Therefore, your equity investments will be taxed at 10% whereas your income returns will be taxed at your marginal tax rate (30% typically).

So, if your goal-based portfolio contains equity funds and bank FDs, your investments will suffer 10% tax on equity investments and 30% tax on bond investments. Therefore, it is logical to shelter bond investments (PF and PPF) from taxes. The arithmetic behind the Sheltering Principle is simple. Suppose you are planning to invest ₹1.5 lakh in PPF and your total investments for the year is, say, ₹4 lakh.

Suppose PPF pays 7% per annum, your portfolio’s expected portfolio return will increase by 0.79% (7% times your marginal tax rate times ₹1.5 lakh divided by your total annual investments). This shows that the benefit decreases as your total investments in a year increase. There is some benefit, nevertheless.

There is a reason why the Sheltering Principle works. The long-term capital gains on ELSS is taxed at 10% just like other equity funds. So, the benefit in investing in ELSS is only the amount you save as taxes in any year you make the investment, which is ₹45,000 (marginal tax rate of 30% of ₹1.5 lakh).

In contrast, by investing in PPF, you not only save ₹45,000 in taxes in any year you invest, your interest income and accumulated amount you withdraw at maturity are also tax-free. This adds to the post-tax expected return on your portfolio through the time horizon for a life goal. The higher post-tax returns reduce stress on savings, giving you more disposable cash for current consumption.

Note that investments in ELSS have a three-year lock-in period under the Income Tax Act. So, you risk losing your unrealised gains if the market moves up during the lock-in period only to decline thereafter. Also, if you invest in ELSS through a systematic investment plan (SIP), each SIP will be subject to the three-year lock-in period.

334,2020/10/04,"Coronavirus | Finance Ministry says COVID-19 past peak, predicts growth","The report said data for the 14-day period from September 17 to 30 suggests that India may have crossed the peak of COVID-19 caseload.

India’s COVID-19 infections may have already peaked last month, setting the stage for a “further push up the frontiers of economic recovery”, the Union Finance Ministry said on Sunday, listing several indicators from September that “allude to a steady recovery across almost all sectors”.

The economic division of the Finance Ministry has pointed to several green shoots from the months of August and September, which combined with the healthy monsoon, augur well for a recovery after India’s growth slipped by 23.9% in the first quarter of 2020-21.

“With India unlocking by the day, consequent demand resurgence is palpable in many sectors. Economic indicators allude to a steady recovery in almost all sectors, with some sectors shooting above their previous-year levels as well. This is despite headwinds of increasing COVID cases in non-metro cities and rural areas and rising food prices,” the Ministry said in its economic review for September.

“Data from September 17 to 30 suggests that India may have crossed the peak of COVID-19 case-load. During this period, the seven-day moving average of daily positive cases has steadily declined from about 93,000 to 83,000, while the seven-day moving average of daily tests have risen from about 1,15,000 to 1,24,000,” the review said.

The pandemic, however, is far from over and to revive growth sustainably, it is imperative that all stakeholders “get into the act as remaining restrictions on access and mobility are further eased”, the Ministry said, advocating a greater focus on “self-protection with more due precautions” than “social distancing” alone.

Positives from package

Terming the partial recovery as proof of “positive results” from the Atma Nirbhar Bharat package, the review said the structural reforms undertaken by the government in various sectors could combat the “downside risk to short-term and medium-term growth” posed by the sustained spread of the virus.

India’s “probable growth path” is visible in the latest assessment of the economy by S&P Global Ratings, which expects the country’s economy and fiscal position to “stabilise and begin to recover from 2021 onwards,” the Finance Ministry said.

Among signs of a recovery in industrial output and manufacturing, the Ministry listed the positive growth in exports, recorded in September for the first time since March and the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index hitting the highest point since January 2012 in September.

Contraction in output of eight core sectors was lower in July and August than the 12.9% shrinkage reported in June, and output prices rose for the first time in six months, reflecting an uptick in input costs, the Ministry pointed out.

GST revenue rises

GST collections hitting a six-month high in September, along with a spurt in highway traffic movement reflected in toll collections surpassing their pre-pandemic levels in the same month, suggests “bustling activity and pent-up demand” even as power consumption in September was higher than a year ago, the Ministry said.

Agriculture, the only sector to grow in the first quarter, remains in a sweet spot, the Ministry said, with India recording above normal rain for the second year in a row and reservoir levels at their highest in ten years.

Stressing that this bodes well for rural demand, the Ministry said tractor sales and registrations were growing already, while sales of passenger vehicles as well as two- and three-wheelers were gaining momentum, “signaling pent-up demand as well as rise in private mode of transportation due to COVID-19”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/xay9e6/article32765672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSINDIA-CASES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/coronavirus-finance-ministry-says-covid-19-past-peak-predicts-growth/article32765673.ece
335,2020/10/04,GST Council meet likely on Monday; non-BJP states to oppose Centre’s borrowing option,"In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering ₹ 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax revenue shortfall.

The GST Council meeting on Monday may turn into a stormy affair, with non-BJP ruled states still being in disagreement with the Centre on the compensation issue.

While as many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on issues, had till mid-September opted to borrow ₹ 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, opposition-led states like West Bengal, Punjab and Kerala have not yet accepted the borrowing option given by the Centre.

Sources said in the 42nd meeting of the Council on October 5, opposition-ruled states would object to the Centre’s borrowing options and demand alternative mechanism for funding GST compensation deficit.

They feel that the constitutional liability of compensating states lies with the union government.

In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering ₹ 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.

Of this, as per Centre’s calculation, about ₹ 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest ₹ 1.38 lakh crore is the impact of COVID-19 on states’ revenues.

The Centre in August gave two options to the states to borrow either ₹ 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or ₹ 2.35 lakh crore from market and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.

The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding the shortfall.

Chief Ministers of six non-BJP ruled states — West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu — have written to the Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet shortfall.

While these states want the Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, the Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.

Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28% slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.

Attorney General of India K.K. Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for the loss of revenue.

He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.

The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenues from the imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19.

The Centre had released over ₹ 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation. However, the amount of cess collected during 2019-20 was ₹ 95,444 crore.

The compensation payout amount was ₹ 69,275 crore in 2018-19 and ₹ 41,146 crore in 2017-18.

During April-July of the current fiscal, the total compensation due to states stand at over ₹ 1.51 lakh crore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/7e2wmp/article32531826.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06GST3,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/gst-council-meeting-non-bjp-states-to-oppose-centres-borrowing-option/article32764813.ece
336,2020/10/04,Ask us: On investments,"Try investing the remaining 15% or so in a Nifty-based equity index mutual fund.

Q. I'm an MBBS graduate. I have saved ₹75,000 from my internship and want to invest the same for the long term (3-4 years), gain returns and use them to fund my higher studies. What would be my best investment option?

Suhas G.

A. You have saved well. If you are unfamiliar with stock markets or equity mutual funds, you need to know that 3-4 years is not long term. It is short term. That essentially means that you cannot consider full exposure to equities believing it will deliver well, as equity investments need a minimum 5-7-year period and may still deliver single-digit returns. I would suggest that you invest 50-60% in short-term FDs and renew them at higher rates when interest rates move up. Try to invest in short-duration debt mutual funds for about 25% of the sum.

Please don’t choose funds based on extremely high returns. Go for middle-order funds and check if the funds invest in only quality AAA-papers. Categories such as banking and PSU debt will fit this.

Try investing the remaining 15% or so in a Nifty-based equity index mutual fund. Please know that this component can go up and down. You need to hold on.

Q. My monthly income is about ₹35,000 and I want to invest in the equity markets. Where can I get adequate returns? What would be the best timing for investing and the precautions I must take before investing?

Abhiranjan Maddheshiya

A. If you plan to invest directly into stock markets, you need to have the following qualities: one, invest for the long term and be patient. Two, do your homework thoroughly to pick stocks. Three, accept mistakes and make course correction instead of living with them.

If you are looking at short-term trading, then learning must be much more — almost full time and dedicated. You should set aside adequate income as buffer before you get into trading and make sure you can handle losses without any pressure of shortage of income or risk of taking debt.

If all the above seems too tough, take the mutual fund route, and invest in a simple equity index fund like the Nifty 50 or Nifty 500 through SIPs. Also, make sure you have debt exposure either through your provident fund or through simple, safe deposits and some 10-15% exposure to gold funds or Exchange traded funds.

This is needed to hedge the volatility arising from equity. Have a long-term outlook of at least 5-7 years and invest in a disciplined manner, whether the market falls or rises. There is no such time as the ‘best time’ to invest. SIPs are designed to ensure you do not need to time the market.

Q. I am a senior citizen and would like to invest in gold bonds. Is there a lock-in period? How safe is it? What's the interest rate?

Sivakami Thyagarajan

A. If you are buying sovereign gold bonds (SGBs) to earn income, it is not a good idea. You may be better off choosing the RBI Floating Rate Bonds for income needs. SGBs earn 2.5% interest as of now.

They have a lock-in of 8 years, with an exit option in the fifth year. Although it is a government bond, its prices will keep fluctuating in line with gold prices and you will receive an amount close to the price of gold when it matures.

While they can be sold in the market, you can’t be sure you get a good price or sell it at all, as many of these instruments are thinly traded. It may be simpler for you to buy a gold fund or gold ETF, although they don’t carry interest rates, if your purpose is to just have some exposure to gold.

337,2020/10/04,Returns tango with risk,"Every investment carries an element of risk and an investor must be fully aware of the same

Most of us think that ROI means Return On Investment. This is true; but ROI can also mean Risk on Investment. Risk and return are two sides of the same coin.

When we say ‘high risk, high returns,’ the word ‘returns’ impacts our mind prominently. This is because we all want returns on our investment and rightly so. However, think quietly: should it be ‘high risk, high return’ or ‘high return, high risk’ ?

When we say the former, we feel everyone who takes higher risk will get higher returns. The fact is all high-return investments also have a high risk component. Risk and returns are inseparable.

Is it ever possible for a rose plant to grow without thorns on it? Can a butcher say, I will not see blood and flesh. What about a fisherman who is scared of water? Similarly, there cannot be returns on investment without risk attached to it. The very first risk we take is parting with our money.

There are many kinds of risk attached to different kinds of investments. Before investing, it is important to know about them. A car driver ought to have complete knowledge of the brake and accelerator before starting the vehicle.

The suggestion, however, is not to stay away from investing. One of the biggest risks an individual takes in life is not investing. An equally huge risk is to invest without knowing the associated risks.

Biggest risk

Mitali and Sudhir are a very young, newly-married couple. They wanted to purchase a home. Their landlord was willing to sell the property to them. He was also considerate towards structuring the deal in a manner which would be a win-win for both the sides.

For down payment, they needed ₹25 lakh. Most of the couple’s funds were locked in tax-saving instruments and a plot of land purchased from the money received at the time of marriage. Funds were available but locked in.

This is the biggest risk that faces investors of today.

Investments are made without keeping in mind ‘My GDP’ – My Goals and Dreams Plan. Always keep an eye on ‘My GDP’ before investing.

Types of risk

Apart from the above, the two important categories of risk associated with any kind of investment are (1) transparent and non-transparent risks (2) systematic and unsystematic risks.

When we invest in stock markets or gold, the risk is transparent. We can see the movement of prices and market value of our investments.

When we invest in bank fixed deposits, there is no way to find out how much we are losing to inflation on a daily or weekly basis. Therefore, investments in stock market and gold are transparent risks. On the other hand, investment in fixed deposit, and for that matter, even real estate to some extent, is a non-transparent risk.

Systematic risk is one which exists in the system. Inflation, for example, is a part of the economic system. The moment we invest in any kind of instrument, we inherit inflation risk. Similar is the case with government policies, geo-political tensions and the like.

Unsystematic risk is attached to a particular investment. For example, if the investment is in an equity mutual fund and the government decides to tax investments in gold, our investment in equity will not affected, but that in gold will be.

Similarly, if we have shares of ABC Ltd. and if the MD of XYZ Ltd. resigns there will not be any impact on ABC Ltd. This is because tax on gold and the resignation of MD of XYZ Ltd. are not a part of the system and hence, will not affect all forms of investment.

We must invest to achieve our financial goals but keep an eye on ‘My ROI’ – My Risk On Investment.

The Personal Data Protection Bill, which proposes to put restriction on use of personal data without explicit consent of citizens, is likely to be tabled in the next year’s Budget session of Parliament, according to a source.

The draft of the Bill, approved by the Cabinet in December 2019, proposes a penalty of up to ₹15 crore and up to three-year jail term for company executives for violating privacy norms.

“The time for the joint committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill has been extended to the second week of the winter session. The final Bill is expected to be tabled in Parliament in the Budget session after incorporating the suggestions of the committee,” the source said.

The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in February and has been referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee of both the Houses, headed by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi, for examination and report.

The draft approved by the Cabinet in December mandates storage of critical data of individuals by internet companies within the country while sensitive data can be transferred overseas only after explicit consent of the data owner.

The Bill has been drafted following a Supreme Court judgement in August 2017 that declared ‘Right to Privacy’ a fundamental right.

The need for a strong personal data protection regime was further highlighted by the apex court in its judgement in September 2018 in which it held Aadhaar as a constitutionally valid scheme but struck down some provisions in the Aadhaar Act.

As per the provisions of the Bill, all internet companies will have to mandatorily store critical data of individuals within the country. However, they can transfer sensitive data overseas after explicit consent of the data owner to process it only for purposes permissible under the proposed legislation.

Critical data will be defined by the government from time to time. Data related to health, religious or political orientation, biometrics, genetic, sexual orientation, health, financial etc have been identified as sensitive data.

339,2020/10/04,India Inc expects over 50% capacity utilisation in H2FY20: CII,"On exports, 40% expect better prospects and 24% expect no change, it added.

The Indian industry expects a steady recovery in the domestic economy driven by estimates of more than 50% capacity utilisation in the second half of this financial year -- the first time since the start of the pandemic, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry.

The industry body added that the CEOs of top 115 companies, who met at CII''s National Council earlier this week, indicated revival of business sentiment and a gradual rise in expected corporate performance.

The CEOs, who took part in the poll, represented various sectors such as metals, mining, manufacturing, auto, pharma, health, energy, infrastructure, construction, ITeS, health, hospitality, tourism and e-commerce.

Asked about consumer demand, 31% of the CEOs expected revenue growth to be positive in the second half of the current financial year compared to last year. Meanwhile, 32% said they were hopeful of better prospects and 27% said they expect no change when compared to the second half of last year.

On exports, 40% expect better prospects and 24% expect no change, it added

“While in most cases, the performance – revenue or capacity utilisation – is estimated to be lower than the comparative figures in 2019-20, a large percentage of the CEOs polled have shown confidence in the days ahead indicating that the worst may be behind,” the industry body said.

CII in a statement said the Centre and State both will need to focus on livelihoods in addition to lives. Hence, efforts need to be made to stall the practice of sudden and adhoc lockdowns announced by States as well as districts.

340,2020/10/04,Govt weighs legal options in Vodafone tax arbitration case,"Finance Ministry sources said the government will decide on challenging the award before a court in Singapore.

The government is weighing its legal options after losing the high-profile international tax arbitration case against Vodafone as it looks to limit damages not just in this matter but also in case of a separate lawsuit with Cairn Energy goes against it.

Last month, an international arbitration court ruled that the Indian government seeking ₹ 22,100 crore in taxes from telecom giant Vodafone using retrospective legislation was in “breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment” guaranteed under the bilateral investment protection pact between India and the Netherlands.

Finance Ministry sources said the government will decide on challenging the award before a court in Singapore - which was the seat of the arbitration, after taking legal opinion.

While the cost implication in the case is limited to having to pay ₹ 85 crore to Vodafone in legal cost, what is weighing on the government mind is a separate arbitration involving UK’s Cairn Energy plc.

If a separate arbitration panel were to hold a demand for ₹ 10,247 crore in taxes using the same retrospective legislation as illegal, the government will have to pay Cairn as much as USD 1.5 billion (₹ 11,000 crore).

This is the amount equivalent to the value of shares of Cairn that the government had sold to recover a part of the tax demand. It also includes the dividends and tax refund seized.

Sources said Vodafone International Holding (a Netherland company) had in February 2007 bought 100% shares of Cayman Island-based company CGP Investments for USD 11.1 billion to indirectly get 67% control of Hutchison Essar Ltd - an Indian company.

The Tax Department felt the deal was designed to avoid capital gain tax in India and so imposed a tax demand, which was rejected by the Supreme Court in 2012.

To stop abuse and plug the loophole of such indirect transfer of Indian assets, the government in 2012 amended the law to make such transfers taxable in India, they said adding Vodafone was slapped with a fresh demand which the firm contested through international arbitration.

The tax demand on Cairn Energy, they said, is different as it pertains to alleged capital gains the firm made on transfer of Indian assets to a new company and listing it on bourses.

Dheeraj Nair, Partner, J Sagar Associates, said the government “should challenge the (Vodafone) award since this award will have persuasive value in other treaty arbitrations which concern the retrospective tax measures”.

“Any party dissatisfied with the award has a right to challenge it, therefore such challenge is justified,” he said.

Sonam Chandwani, Managing Partner at KS Legal & Associates, however, said “as the Permanent Court of Arbitration situated in The Hague had passed the award in favour of Vodafone, there lies no further authority for putting up appeal”.

“The government can only go back to the Permanent Court of Arbitration on some technical point, but that will not serve any purpose,” she said.

Since the Indian Arbitration Act obliges the government to implement a foreign tribunal award, Vodafone can ask for the same in case the award was challenged in Indian courts, she said.

“However, in the present scenario, since all the property, both tangible and non-tangible of Vodafone, lies outside India it will be difficult for the government to procure the same,” she said.

She said in the case of Cairn Energy, India in order to procure the retrospective taxes has already expropriated all their investment.

“In circumstances such as when the Permanent Court of Arbitration gives a decree in favour of Cairn, the government of India still has the option to procure the desired retrospective taxes via grounds such that taxation is not covered under any bilateral investment protection treaty and as such cannot be arbitrated. It is challenging the jurisdiction of such panels to adjudicate on a tax matter,” she said.

Mr. Nair said the government certainly has the option not to appeal in Vodafone but do so in the case of Cairn as each case is independent and brought under a different treaty, which gives different protections.

Cairn’s claim is under the India-UK treaty whereas Vodafone’s claim was under the India-Netherlands treaty.

While Mr. Nair said there would not be any additional negative impact on investor sentiment as they recognise that challenge proceedings are part of the norm, Ms. Chandwani said appealing against an international arbitration award will disincentivise the investors.

“Any investor will start contemplating on investing in such countries as any dispute arises the government of such countries might not comply with the international order, putting the investors to losses. It creates hindrance in the ease of doing business in such countries and thus discourage them to make any investments to indulge in any form of funding,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sw24p1/article31216786.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VODAFONEIDEAMOBILEKB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/govt-weighs-legal-options-in-vodafone-tax-arbitration-case/article32764724.ece

342,2020/10/04,In cooling-off mode,"While the long-term outlook is positive, the price may drift lower in the near term.

After a period of consolidation, the prices of precious metals saw a cool-off in September. The firm trend in the U.S. dollar along with a recovery in the equity market affected market sentiment.

Comex gold closed 4.4% lower in September to settle at $1,890.9 an ounce. The fall in comex silver was dramatic with the metal losing 17.9% to settle at $23.3 an ounce.

In the domestic market, MCX gold futures closed 3.2% lower to ₹50,334 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures closed 14.9% lower to ₹59,919 per kg.

Comex gold ruled weak with prices slipping below the lower end of the prior trading range at $1,910-$2,025. While the long-term outlook for Comex gold remains positive, there are no signs of completion of the recent price cool-off. A move above $1,980 would indicate the resumption of the long-term uptrend.

Until $1,980 is taken out, the premise would be that the short-term cool-off phase is at play. Comex gold may slip to the immediate target range of $1,825-1,840 range in the short term. A move past $1,980 is required to invalidate this short-term weak outlook.

Comex silver, too, breached the prior support zone at $25.5 resulting in a slide to $21.2. The price has subsequently recovered in the past few trading sessions.

While the long-term outlook is positive, the price may drift lower in the near term. A fall below $23 would be a sign of weakness and could push silver price to $21-21.5 an ounce.

MCX gold has been consolidating in the ₹49,500-54,500 range. This trend may persist until the price gets past the ₹55,000 per 10 gm- level. A fall below ₹49,400 would impart weakness and price could then drift to the next target of ₹47,500-48,000. Until the price gets above ₹55,000, a slide to ₹48,000 would be the preferred short-term outlook.

MCX silver dropped below the lower end of the prior range at ₹64,000, resulting in a sharp crack thereafter.

The short-term trend is weak and a slide to ₹58,300 appears likely. The short-term trend could turn much weaker on a close below ₹57,500. Until price moves above ₹64,000, a slide to ₹58,300 would be the preferred view.

To summarise, precious metals are in a short-term downtrend while the long-term trend remains positive.
