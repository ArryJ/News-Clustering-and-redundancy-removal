0,2020/10/20,"Sindhu is in London for better training prospects, says father","‘She went alone because she has to remain there for two months’ says PV Ramana as he slams reports citing the world champions’ fallout with family.

World Champion P V Sindhu is in London to prepare for next year’s Asia leg of the Badminton World Federation’s calendar as “her practice was not happening properly” at the ongoing national camp in Hyderabad, her father PV Ramana has said.

The Olympic silver-medallist has been in London for the last 10 days and posted a picture with sports nutritionist Rebecca Randell of the Gatorade Sports Science Institute (GSSI), her training base, on her social media page on Monday.

“She has been in London for last 10 days. We can’t stay with her for two months, so she went alone,” Ramana, who has often spoken on behalf of the shuttler told PTI, refuting reports that she left because of an unspecified dispute in the family.

Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the BWF has been forced to move the World Tour Finals (Jan 27-31) and the two Asia opens (Jan 12-17 and Jan 19-24) to Bangkok in January next year.

Ramana said that the celebrated shuttler was not happy with her training at the national camp.

“Her practice was not happening properly here. After the 2018 Asian Games, Gopi (chief coach Pullela Gopichand) didn’t take interest in her training. He didn’t provide a proper practice partner to train with her.

“She was not having enough quality practice and was fed up with the treatment,” he claimed.

When contacted, Gopichand confirmed that Sindhu had informed him about her move to London but refused to respond to Ramana’s remarks.

“She has gone for that Gatorade training academy, that is the information we have. They have a training institute there. I don’t know the exact details or duration of the program,” he said.

“I don’t want to respond to what her father has to say, if Sindhu says something, I will respond,” he added.

Ramana said Sindhu had informed the Badminton Association of India (BAI) regarding her trip to London and had also kept Gopichand in the loop.

“She had sent a letter to BAI last week about her trip, with a copy to Gopi...and since she will be there for at least eight weeks, she will be practicing with England team. So, she requested BAI to put in a word to Badminton England,” Ramana said.

Sindhu has been part of the national camp for Olympic hopefuls and was training with her Korean coach Park Tae Sang ever since Kim Ji Hyun resigned last year.

She skipped the recently-concluded Denmark Open Super 750 tournament and will next be seen in action at the Asian leg of the adjusted BWF World Tour 2020 in January.

2,2020/10/20,"AI-powered ‘mini-brains’ to help robots perceive pain, self-repair","The AI-enabled sensors can process and react to pain caused by external pressure, and also help the robot to detect its own minor damages and repair itself.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Scientists at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have developed an artificial intelligence-based solution, designed to help robots perceive pain and repair themselves.

The solution uses artificial intelligence (AI) in the network of sensors at different points with multiple small processing units, that work like ‘mini-brains’ on the robotic skin, a NTU release noted.

The AI-enabled sensors can process and react to pain caused by external pressure, and also help the robot to detect its own minor damages and repair itself, it added.

The system uses a type of self-healing ion gel material to help the robot recover its mechanical functions in case of minor damages.

“This mimics how our biological system works, much like the way human skin heals on its own after a cut,” Rohit Abraham John, first author of the study, said in the release.

Since the system allows the robots to learn and process things locally, the scientists claim, it can reduce the wiring requirements and response time for the robots by five to ten times compared to conventional robots.

""Our work has demonstrated the feasibility of a robotic system that is capable of processing information efficiently with minimal wiring and circuits,” Arindam Basu, co-lead author of the study, said.

Further, to train the robot, the scientists used ‘brain-like’ electronic devices called memtransistors, which work as artificial pain receptors.

“For robots to work together with humans one day, one concern is how to ensure they will interact safely with us,” Basu, said. “For that reason, scientists around the world have been finding ways to bring a sense of awareness to robots, such as being able to 'feel' pain, to react to it, and to withstand harsh operating conditions,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/jvqcjk/article32901133.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Robot,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ai-powered-mini-brains-to-help-robots-perceive-pain-self-repair/article32901129.ece
3,2020/10/20,"Facebook, Carnegie Mellon partner to find new ways to store renewable energy","Facebook also said its data centers will achieve net-zero emissions by the end of 2020.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Facebook and Carnegie Mellon University have launched a dataset, called Open Catalyst Project, to discover low-cost catalysts that can help increase storing efficiency of renewable energy. They are also asking the scientific community to contribute to their effort in finding new, efficient ways of storing renewable energy.

The duo intend to use artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate quantum mechanical simulations by 1,000x in order to discover new electrocatalysts needed for more efficient and scalable ways to store and use renewable energy, Facebook said in a statement.

Renewables made up for 26.2% of global electricity generation in 2018, and that is expected to rise to 45% by 2040, according to estimates from Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.

One of the few scalable solutions entails converting excess solar and wind energy into other fuels, such as hydrogen or ethanol. Unfortunately, current methods for doing so are inefficient or rely on rare and expensive electrocatalysts like platinum, limiting their practicality. The Open Catalyst Project's goal is to discover low-cost catalysts to drive these chemical reactions.

​To achieve this, the team will use AI to accurately predict atomic interactions dramatically faster than the compute-heavy simulations scientists rely on today. Calculations that take modern laboratories days could, with the help of AI, take seconds. This has ramifications outside catalysis, and will enable scientists to rapidly explore and iterate on other challenges that involve quantum mechanics, Facebook said.

The California-based company said it will make its baseline model available on GitHub, and will set up leaderboards for developers to benchmark and compare progress.

Facebook also said its data centers will reach net zero emissions by the end of 2020.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/bat12r/article32900895.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/wind-energy-reutersjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-carnegie-mellon-partner-to-find-new-ways-to-store-renewable-energy/article32900888.ece
4,2020/10/20,"Sweden bans Huawei, ZTE from upcoming 5G networks","European governments have been tightening controls on Chinese companies building 5G networks, following diplomatic pressure from Washington, which alleges Huawei equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Sweden on Tuesday banned on security grounds the use of telecom equipment from China's Huawei and ZTE in its 5G network ahead of a spectrum auction scheduled for next month, joining other European nations that have restricted the role of Chinese suppliers.

The Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS) said the setting of the licence conditions followed assessments by the Swedish Armed Forces and security service, which called China “one of the biggest threats against Sweden”.

European governments have been tightening controls on Chinese companies building 5G networks, following diplomatic pressure from Washington, which alleges Huawei equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied being a national security risk.

The United Kingdom in July ordered Huawei equipment to be purged completely from Britain's 5G network by 2027, becoming one of the first European countries to do so.

Huawei and ZTE did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision by Sweden, home to Ericsson, one of Europe's leading telecoms equipment suppliers. The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately comment.

“The ban leaves network operators with less options and risks slowing the rollout of 5G in markets where competition is reduced,” said Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight.

Ericsson, unlike Nokia, has won contracts from all three major operators in China to supply radio equipment for 5G networks, and could be at risk if the Chinese government decides to retaliate.

“It could be that some of the European vendors will sell less in China going forward if the Chinese are selling less in Europe going forward,” CEO Kjell Johnsen of Swedish-based telecom operator Tele2 said in a post-earnings conference call.

LIKELY BENEFICIARIES

The Swedish ban is likely to benefit Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. Keith Krach, the U.S. undersecretary of state for economic affairs, had earlier said the Scandinavian companies were the only ones that European governments should choose.

Ericsson and Nokia declined to comment on the ban.

PTS said companies taking part in the auction must remove Huawei and ZTE gear from existing central functions by Jan. 1, 2025.

The regulator defined central functions as equipment used to build the radio access, transmission and core networks as well as the service and maintenance of the network.

PTS said the licence conditions were aimed at addressing the assessments by the armed forces and security service.

It has approved the participation of Sweden's Hi3G Access, Net4Mobility, Telia Sverige and Teracom in the planned spectrum auction of 3.5 GHz and 2.3 GHz, key bands crucial for the rollout of 5G.

Tele2 and Telenor will participate together as Net4Mobility to secure spectrum for a joint nationwide 5G network.

Tele2, which uses Huawei equipment in its network, which had earlier called Huawei an important vendor, said the PTS decision ”does not change our plans substantially”.

“Many operators have already proven that when they rip and replace Chinese equipment, it doesn't have a negative impact on their capital spending,” said industry consultant John Strand.

The 5G spectrum auction was originally planned for early 2020, but last year PTS said it would delay the auction due to a security review. PTS announced in April this year that the auction would begin in November.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/k954jm/article32900802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Huawei-ZTE-,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/sweden-bans-huawei-zte-from-upcoming-5g-networks/article32900796.ece
5,2020/10/20,"Google updates Assistant features, adds Zoom and dark mode","Besides adding features to Assistant smart displays, Google rolled out Lending DocAI, its first dedicated tool for mortgage industry.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Google is updating look and features of its Assistant smart displays with a new home screen. The search-giant will update Smart displays such as Nest Hub and other made by third party companies with dark mode and ability to set up multiple accounts on Google assistant devices.

In addition to this, Google will add Zoom to Assistant-enabled smart displays later this year.

“As we expect more of our smart home devices, Smart Displays are increasingly becoming a hub that entertains and connects the whole home and whole family, all day (and night) long,” Google said in a blog post.

Dark theme will change the colour scheme of the interface while providing with visual and touch access. Users can keep the classic Light Theme or set to “Automatic'' so that the display adjusts naturally based on the ambient light or when the sun rises and sets.

Additionally, Google will now allow users with separate personal and work accounts to see all upcoming events and meetings in one place by allowing them to set up multiple accounts. Just say, “Hey Google, join my next meeting”, to participate in a meeting, whether it’s a personal yoga class or a conference call.

Google has changed its home screen design to incorporate contextual information depending on a user’s habits and time of the day. For instance, “Your morning” will show a reminder for first meeting, a run-down of the morning news and a glance at the weather ahead.

The new visual layout also has a “Home control” page, to control the connected devices throughout the house, from turning off the lights in the bedroom to taking a look at who’s at the front door.

A tool for mortgage businesses

Besides adding features to Assistant smart displays, Google rolled out Lending DocAI, its first dedicated tool for mortgage industry. The tool uses machine learning models to automate routine document reviews and speed up the process of evaluating a borrower’s income and asset documents.

Google said it enables mortgage applications to be easily processed across all stages of the mortgage lifecycle, and accelerate time to close in the loan process. By using data access controls, it reduces the risk of implementing an AI strategy.

“Our goal is to give you the right tools to help borrowers and lenders have a better experience and to close mortgage loans in shorter time frames, benefiting all parties involved,” Google said.

“With Lending DocAI, you will reduce mortgage processing time and costs, streamline data capture, and support regulatory and compliance requirements.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/lf5uz6/article32900713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Google-smart-display-new-featurespng,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-updates-assistant-features-adds-zoom-and-dark-mode/article32900629.ece
6,2020/10/20,Regulatory probes Google is facing in Asia,"Here's a list of the current investigations and reviews into the alleged anticompetitive practices at Google in Asia.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

The U.S. Justice Department is expected to file a lawsuit against Alphabet Inc's Google, possibly asking a court to break up the $1 trillion search and advertising giant.

Here's a list of the current investigations and reviews into the alleged anticompetitive practices at Google in Asia.

India:

Reuters, citing sources, reported this month that Google is facing a new antitrust case in India for allegedly abusing its Android operating system's position in the smart television market.

The case is Google's fourth major antitrust challenge in India.

In 2018, the country's anti-competition regulator fined Google for “search bias,” but a company appeal against that is pending. The regulator is also probing Google for allegedly misusing its dominant position to reduce the ability of smartphone makers to opt for alternate versions of Android, as well as reviewing a case alleging that Google unfairly promotes its mobile payments app in the country.

China:

China is preparing to launch an antitrust probe looking into allegations that Google leveraged the dominance of its Android mobile operating system to stifle competition, Reuters reported last month, citing sources.

The case has been submitted by the country's top market regulator to the State Council's antitrust committee for review, the sources said.

Google's main search platform has been blocked in China since 2010 but it still has some business in the country, such as advertising sales.

Australia:

Australia sued Google in July for misleading consumers to get permission for use of their personal data for targeted advertising. The country's antitrust regulator has also warned that Google's planned $2.1 billion acquisition of fitness tracker maker Fitbit may give it too much of people's data, potentially hurting competition in health and online advertising markets.

The regulator also wants independent mediators to decide how much Google pays media companies for republishing their content. Google, which responded by saying its main search engine may be at risk in Australia as a result, has announced a plan to pay $1 billion to publishers globally for their news over the next three years.

Japan:

Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said on Monday it will join forces with the United States and Europe to take on any market abuses by the four Big Tech companies - Google, Apple , Amazon and Facebook.

South Korea:

South Korea's antitrust regulator said earlier this month it was reviewing Google's plans to charge 30% commissions for in-app purchases made through its to application store, widening scrutiny that started with the country's telecom regulator.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/sjasue/article32900492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/google-anti-trustjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/regulatory-probes-google-is-facing-in-asia/article32900446.ece
7,2020/10/20,UK issues guidelines on personal data transfers with organisations in EU,"With less than three months before the end of UK’s transition period, the government launched ‘time is running out’ campaign for businesses and people.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

The UK government has detailed steps that businesses and organisations should take regarding data protection and data flows with the European Union/European Economic Area after the end of the transition period.

With less than three months before the end of UK’s transition period, the government launched ‘time is running out’ campaign for businesses and people.

“There are new rules for businesses and citizens from 1 January, 2021,” it read.

The government detailed measures for UK businesses and organisations that receive and transfer personal data between organisations abroad, including in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU and those who operate in the EEA.

Starting January 1, 2021, organisations may need to have Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) in place while signing agreements with EU counterparts in order to legally receive personal data from the EU.

SCC is set of terms and conditions that both the sender and receiver sign for every data transfer, which is then approved by an official European regulator.

“The EU’s data adequacy assessment of the UK is underway and we are confident that adequacy decisions can be concluded by the end of the transition period,” it noted.

This would enable free flow of personal data from the EU/EEA to the UK without any further action by organisations.

In case EU has not made adequacy decisions in respect of the UK before the end of transition period, organisations will be required to put in place alternative transfer mechanisms to ensure data can continue to legally flow between the EU/EEA and the UK.

The government said that 11 of the 12 countries deemed adequate by the EU said that they will maintain unrestricted personal data flows with the UK.

There are currently no changes to the way businesses send personal data to the EU, EEA, Gibraltar and other countries deemed adequate by the EU.

In addition to this, EU data protection law will apply to certain ‘legacy’ personal data if the UK has not been granted full adequacy decisions by the end of the transition period. Legacy data includes personal data of individuals outside the UK processed in the UK prior to the end of the transition period, or subsequently on the basis of the Withdrawal Agreement.

The guidelines mentioned that GDPR will be retained in UK law and will continue to be read alongside the Data Protection Act 2018.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/lgevwz/article32899642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/eu-uk-business-guidelinesjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/uk-issues-guidelines-on-personal-data-transfers-with-organisations-in-eu/article32899566.ece

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Verizon said on Monday it has struck deals with Microsoft and Nokia to improve the telecoms giant's ability to target business customers by offering clients the ability to automate factory floors, lower costs and speed up data traffic through private 5G networks.

Private 5G networks remove the need for businesses to jostle for speed with others on a public network and help enable data-intensive applications that use computer vision, augmented reality and machine learning to increase productivity.

Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing business, will run on top of Verizon's 5G network to processes the data generated by machines at the local facility and use artificial intelligence to automate operations. Microsoft launched the new service late last month directed at telecom operators.

U.S.-based logistics company Ice Mobility is the first customer for the new partnership, allowing it to track employees packing the products into the right boxes to skip quality control.

“This is about creating a new business opportunity for everyone,” Verizon's Chief Strategy Officer Rima Qureshi said. She declined to disclose how the revenue would be shared between Verizon and Microsoft.

While 4G helped create multi-billion dollar businesses ranging from music and video streaming to cab hailing and food delivery, telecom operators seldom got a share of that growth.

Verizon is now keen on taking a share in new businesses that 5G might enable, either by partnering with bigger companies or by buying stakes in smaller ones such as virtual reality company 8i to Swiftmile, which makes charging systems for electric scooters.

In international markets, where Verizon doesn't have its own network, it is working with Nokia to build private networks for manufacturing and logistics companies.

“Next year will be all about deploying private 5G and not about commercial success and we will start seeing early monetization from 2022 onwards,” Sowmyanarayan Sampath, president of Verizon's global enterprise business, told Reuters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/syn04q/article32900482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/verizon-reuters,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/verizon-signs-up-microsoft-nokia-to-help-clients-build-private-5g-networks/article32899492.ece

In any development of a cross-border digital currency, it is more important for the United States “to get it right than be first,” U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday.

“We do think it's more important to get it right than to be first and getting it right means that we not only look at the potential benefits of a CBDC, but also the potential risks, and also recognize the important trade-offs that have to be thought through carefully,” Powell said in a panel discussion on digital payments hosted by the International Monetary Fund.

Powell said it is vital the Fed assess what impact a CBDC might have on a range of critical issues.

“In addition to assessing the benefits - and there may well be benefits - there are also some quite difficult policy and operational questions that need to be thoroughly evaluated,” Powell said. “Just to mention a few, I would mention the need to protect a CBDC from cyber attacks, counterfeiting and fraud, the question of how a CBDC would affect monetary policy and financial stability, and also how could a CBDC prevent illicit activity while also preserving user privacy and security.”

Powell said that while the Fed has made no decision yet on issuing a digital currency, it is an active participant in research into the prospect in partnership with other central banks and the Bank for International Settlements. Moreover, it is conducting research on its own.

“One set of experiments is being carried out at the board of governors here in Washington, D.C.,” Powell said. “Complementary efforts are also now underway, for example through the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which, in collaboration with researchers at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), is developing a hypothetical central bank digital currency.”

The world's largest central banks, and even some of the smaller ones, are toying with the idea of issuing digital currencies.

While most projects are still at an early stage, central banks have switched into higher gear in the past year after Facebook announced plans to create its own virtual token and the COVID-19 pandemic boosted digital payments. Their main fear is losing control of the payment system if private currencies such as Facebook's proposed Libra are widely adopted.

China, which has been ahead of other major economies in experimenting with a digital currency, has publicly said it aims to become the first to issue one to reduce its dependence on the global dollar payment system.

12,2020/10/20,Bihar Assembly election: Congress ‘sings’ migrants ‘anger’,"Out of power for over 3 decades and without a distinct caste-community combination that make up its core voters, Congress seems to be trying to build a new constituency of voters

“Ka kiye ho [What have you done?]”- the Congress’s video song for the Bihar Assembly elections released on Friday last, comprising haunting images of migrant workers heading back home after the nation-wide COVID-19 lockdown was announced, seems to be a part of a clear strategy to tap migrant workers’ ‘anger’.

The hardship faced by the poor in the initial days of the lockdown is a recurrent theme of the Congress’s poll campaign in an attempt to portray the BJP-led government at the Centre and the Nitish Kumar-led NDA dispenation in the State as “insensitive”.

“Lakhs of our brothers and sisters from from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have had to walk back thousands of kilometres. And in Bihar, Nitish Babu [Chief Minister] had said that they wouldn't be allowed”, Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala, who is now overseeing the party’s campaign, told reporters in Patna on Tuesday.

Out of power for over three decades and without a distinct caste-community combination that make up its core voters, the Congress seems to be trying to build a new constituency of voters that manages to transcend caste boundaries on the basis of shared experiences.

Sonia’s call

Setting the tone for the Bihar elections, party president Sonia Gandhi told her colleagues at a virtual meeting last Sunday, “The country was pushed into the abyss of Corona pandemic by sheer ineptitude and mismanagement of the Modi Government. All this happened as we witnessed the biggest unplanned, unmanaged and cruel migration of crores of migrant labourers as Government remained a mute spectator to their miseries”.

According to a written reply by the Ministry of Labour in Parliament last month, there are an estimated 15 lakh migrant workers who had returned to Bihar since the lockdown was imposed in March. And the Congress is clearly eyeing a chunk of this voting segment to come its way.

Political analysts’ view

Political analysts, however, are sceptical about the outcome.

“As far as migrant labourers are concerned, many of them have returned to places like Mumbai, Chandigarh, Ludhiana and other places. They are not well to travel again to vote. And even if they do, caste and clan loyalties will play a part”, Professor Ashutosh Kumar, chairperson of the Department of Political Science, Panjab University, said about his native State.

“It's a good narrative and sounds good but I am not sure of its impact, as elections in Bihar are fought on caste lines. And the Congress has been a winnable party since the 1990s and has lost the support of even its traditional voters like Harijans and Muslims. But because of their alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal, they can hope to get votes from the Yadavs and Muslims”, he added",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/icnr78/article32902190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-MIGRANTS-BIHAR-KVSGIRI,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-election-congress-sings-migrants-anger/article32902191.ece
13,2020/10/20,"Bihar Assembly Elections | Bihar needs an alternative voice, says Asaduddin Owaisi","JD(U), BJP, RJD and Congress have failed the people, says AIMIM chief.

President of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen Asaduddin Owaisi says the people of Bihar need an alternative, explaining the reasons for allying with the Samajwadi Janata Dal (Democratic), Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samata Party and Bahujan Samaj Party. The AIMIM is contesting 18 seats in the 243-member Assembly.

Also read: Bihar Assembly elections | I cannot wish that Chirag Paswan is a victor, says Devendra Fadnavis

What is the AIMIM’s vision for Bihar?

We started our political journey five years ago. When we contested six Assembly seats, we lost deposit in five of them. We have been consistently demanding justice for the most backward region of our country, the Seemanchal region. It should be granted special status. Bihar right now requires an alternative political voice that is different from JD(U)-BJP-RJD-Congress combination. Because during 15 years of Nitish Kumar or 15 years of the RJD, nothing has happened in terms of real development. In every parameter, Bihar is still behind the rest of the country. During the COVID crisis, the highest unemployment rate of nearly 46% was in Bihar compared to the national average of 26%.

What was the compulsion to contest with such a disparate group of parties, like the BSP that has had a different stand from you on all critical issues or Upendra Kushwaha’s RLSP who decided belatedly to exit the mahagatbandhan?

Initially, we started our journey alone. Then we had an alliance with Mr. Devendra Prasad Yadav’s Samajwadi Janata Party. Later on, there was a lot of discussion to be part of a larger alliance, so that a consolidated fight can be given to the RJD and Nitish Kumar.

As far as Mr. Kushwaha is concerned, questions were not asked till he was with the RJD or the BJP. Questions are raised only when someone allies with us. The meeting point for all of us is to form an alternative political platform.

You are always referred to as a ‘nuisance factor’ of the Indian politics, be it in Maharashtra, now Bihar and at some point you would be contesting West Bengal elections too...

Well, if I am a nuisance to Congress, BJP, RJD and JD(U) then that means I am doing something good. All these nomenclatures — vote katua or nuisance — don’t matter to me. It only shows that we are becoming stronger on the ground. Last Assembly elections, the mahagatbandhan contested on only one issue, that is, ‘we will stop the BJP’. Nitish Kumar had gone to the extent of saying that he will work for ‘Sangh-mukt Bharat’. Lalu Prasad had said, ‘We will stop Mohan Bhagwat [RSS chief]’. All these three parties are to be blamed for the BJP being in power today in the State. The fault of deceiving and lying to the people of Bihar lies with them.

Why should the Bihari Muslim vote for you instead of RJD, Congress or JD(U) who are already an established political force in the State?

We are not an exclusive Muslim party. I, Asaduddin Owaisi, am not a Muslim leader. I don’t want to be a Muslim leader; that is not my ambition or objective of my political journey. Voters of Bihar should exercise their vote in our favour because the RJD and the Congress have utterly failed in stopping the BJP juggernaut. Five years ago they took your vote and now BJP is back in power. They were unable to put up a fight during the parliamentary elections in Bihar and because of them, the NDA won 39 Parliament seats. And another example of why you must vote AIMIM is the Kisanganj parliamentary seat. Our candidate Akhtrul Iman got 3 lakh votes, the JD(U) got 3.25 lakh votes and the present Congress MP got 3.5 lakh votes. Had we not contested, even that seat would have been lost.

Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Tuesday exuded confidence that the Grand Alliance involving his party and the RJD will form the government in Bihar following the upcoming Assembly elections.

The former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan said he will go to Bihar for campaigning.

Mr Pilot said Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) president Nitish Kumar’s claim of “good governance” has already been exposed.

“He did not care for the labourers and students who were stranded outside Bihar during the COVID-19 lockdown.

“The election campaign of the Congress and RJD is going well and a change will take place in Bihar with the Congress-RJD alliance forming government,” he told reporters here.

Farm laws

Targeting the BJP-led government at the Centre over the issue of farm laws, Mr Pilot said there is no minister at Central Cabinet who can raise voice for the cause of farmers.

“The farmers are in distress and under attack from all sides, be it inflation or the coronavirus pandemic. But there is not a single minister at the Centre for them.

“In the central cabinet, there is not a single minister who has the courage to present the side of farmers, be it the agriculture minister or any other minister,” Mr Pilot said.

He alleged the Narendra Modi government formulates schemes just for the benefit of industrialists and the farmers have no trust in the dispensation.

Civic body polls

About the six civic bodies election in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Kota to be held on October 29 and November 1, Mr Pilot said the Congress will form boards in all the municipal corporations.

The names of candidates for the elections were finalised after due consultation and discussions, he said, adding, “Those who have been given tickets are party workers. The tickets were given on the basis of feedback, chances of win etc. AICC too has sent observers.”

On the issue of the AICC committee which was formed to look into the issues raised by him and other MLAs in August after his rebellion, Mr Pilot said that the committee would soon come to a conclusion.

“Whatever discussion they have to do, they are doing it. Everything is in their knowledge.

The ADR report noted that the Supreme Court’s directions for political parties to publish the criminal antecedents of their candidates and provide explanations as to why they chose these candidates did not seem to have an impact on parties’ selection of candidates.

“All major parties contesting in Bihar phase I elections have given tickets to 31% to 70% candidates who have declared criminal cases against themselves,” it said.

Kick-starting his campaign in Bihar for the JD(U)-BJP alliance, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday claimed that while the BJP governments worked for all, the Opposition parties believed that a “specific religion” had rights over the nation’s resources.

“We talk of development, they talk of caste. We talk of the nation, they talk about the family. We talk of Sabka Saath Sabke Vikaas. They say a specific religion [community] has rights over the nation’s resources,” said Mr. Adityanath.

“This mentality would take the country towards disintegration,” said Mr. Adityanath. The BJP and its allies were working to achieve the idea of “Ek Bharat, Shresth Bharat,” he said.

In the three decades since the implementation of the Mandal Commission recommendations by the V.P. Singh government, the face of heartland politics has changed beyond recognition, and some surnames that dominated those years are in the fray in the current Bihar Assembly polls, albeit in different ways.

Also read: Bihar Assembly election: Congress ‘sings’ migrants ‘anger’

In Madhepura, Nikhil Mandal, grandson of B.P. Mandal, is fighting the polls for the first time on a Janata Dal (U) ticket.

Mr. Mandal, who entered politics via the student union route in Delhi University 20 years ago, took a sabbatical for a stint in the corporate sector as a banker. “But I was always interested in being with people and my friends used to call me ‘Nokia’ because of the tagline, ‘connecting people’. In 2005, my father was fighting the polls, and those were scheduled for around March, when banks rarely give leave. It was a stark choice before me, and I gave up the job and moved here to get into public service,” he says. Then came five years of drifting in Bihar, and some serious existential questions. “My friends told me to meet Nitish Kumarji and when we met, he told me to join his party and I was appointed a spokesperson.”

Conscious of his legacy, Mr. Mandal says he has faint memories of his grandfather, but has been told that he was, till the end, hopeful of seeing the recommendations made by him implemented by the Government of India. He does not believe, as many do, that India has entered a post-Mandal politics with the domination of the BJP. “What has happened in 30 years is a whole lot of change, but that change to endure and deepen, the twin forces of education and employment must see tenets of social justice implemented in full measure,” he says.

Sharad Yadav daughter in fray

In Madhepura itself, in the Bihariganj Assembly constituency, Subhashini Raj Rao, daughter or former Union Minister Sharad Yadav, is also preparing to make her poll debut on a Congress ticket. Mr. Yadav came into prominence during the JP Movement against Emergency, and has been one of the most important leaders of the social justice stream of Indian politics. Honed in anti-Congressism, his politics is now pivoting on the question of secularism. Ms. Rao is reflecting that pivot.

“Sharadji has been part of the ‘mahagathbandhan’ and they had launched a platform on communal amity called ‘saanjhi virasat’ under his leadership. He wants to take the fight against communalism further. Therefore, despite the fact that much of his career was against the Congress, I joined the party,” she says.

Ms. Rao terms the 2017 break of the ‘mahagathbandhan’, with the JD(U) reverting to the NDA and dumping the RJD as a betrayal of the mandate of 2015. “It is among the people and in public service that we can take forward these ideas,” she notes, explaining her decision to fight the polls.

The two dynasts have made particular political choices, reflecting specific political realities, through a Nitish Kumar who holds on to the social justice plank via his Mahadalit outreach, another through the Congress the old bugbear now considered an ally in secular politics en route reflecting the journey of 30 years of Mandal and mandir politics.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/xk6ie6/article32899704.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nikhil-mandal,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-polls-2-different-dynasts-in-bihar-poll-fray/article32899706.ece

In the Bihar campaign ahead of the Assembly election, if the tall talk of NDA’s chief ministerial face Nitish Kumar has largely disinterested voters, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader and mahagathbandhan (grand alliance)’s CM face Tejashwi Yadav’s poll promise of providing 10 lakh job to youth too has few takers en route to Rohtas from Patna.

“These are all poll promises, only to be forgotten once the poll is over…the figure of 10 lakh jobs itself appears ridiculous and unbelievable”, an unemployed youth of Narhat village market in Rohtas district, Santosh Yadav, told The Hindu.

Mr. Santosh Yadav, 30, does odd jobs to look after his family of five, comprising three siblings and parents. Earlier, he was working at a garment factory in Gujarat, but after the lockdown, returned to his village to take up odd jobs for his family’s survival. He wants to go back to Gujarat in a month or so before he gets married. “There is nothing here to do…if I do not migrate to earn, I’ll not get married”, he quipped.

When told that he is from the Yadav caste and that Mr. Tejashwi Yadav had promised to provide 10 lakh jobs with his first signature in the first Cabinet meeting, if his government comes to power, Mr. Santosh Yadav threw a puckish smile on his chubby face and hummed an old Bollywood song: “Kasme wade, par-wafa sab, wade hain, wado ka kya? [All promises, love and loyalty are only promises, what to do about promises?]”, before expressing his desire to leave the place to work as a daily wage labourer.

At Rohtas district headquarters (Sasaram) too, several youth are seen roaming in search of daily work at hotels and shops. “Chunav mein jisko jo man mein aata hai bolta hai…10 lakh job dena koi mamuli baat nahi hota hai…Tejashwi ke baat ko hum gambhirta se nahi lete hain [People promise anything during poll time…providing 10 lakh jobs is not a mean thing…I do not take Tejashwi’s promises on a serious note]”, said Ashok Kumar Sahu, who works at a sweet shop near Sasaram.

“Tejashwi Yadav is young and he needs time to be politically mature and counter experienced leaders like Nitish Kumar…only making promises will not do…one has to deliver as well”, Ramesh Kushwaha at Paliganj Bazaar said.

At Malliabagh chowk (thoroughfare) in Rohtas, Anand Shankar Singh too did not seem very upbeat about Mr. Tejashwi Yadav’s promises to provide jobs to unemployed youth like him.

“I run a cyber café and somehow survive with a family of six people on the meagre daily income but, yes, given a job would certainly make a huge difference in my life…however, I take all this promises of Tejashwi Yadav like the oft-repeated tall talk on the State’s growth and development by Nitish Kumar”, he stated with a sense of ennui.

“Tejashwi Yadav was Bihar’s Deputy CM under Nitish Kumar for nearly three years from 2015-2017, what did he do then for people like us?”, he asked and himself responded quickly, “nothing”.

A few kilometres away in Baghnur village, a group of youth was seen playing cards under a banyan tree in the excessively humid climate. Initially, they appeared reluctant to talk about poll issues but gradually got themselves involved and asserted, “Tejashwi’s promise of jobs to 10 lakh people should not be taken seriously…what happened to PM Narendra Modi’s promise of giving ₹1.25 lakh crore economic package to Bihar in August 2015?”, asked the three of them in chorus.

And what about Mr. Nitish Kumar saying “they [Tejashwi Yadav and family members] may start their own kaam-dhandha [business] in the name of providing employment?”.

“Someone may ask Mr. Kumar, what has he done for us…he should tell in his election rallies from where and why over 30 lakh people, mostly young, returned to Bihar during lockdown after COVID-19 pandemic outbreak…why we’re still forced to migrate from our State even after he has been in power for 15 years?”.

Tejashwi Yadav, the Leader of Opposition had, recently, announced that if his party were to be voted to power, 10 lakh government jobs would be sanctioned at the very first Cabinet meeting. The RJD leader had also said that the State’s unemployment rate was around 46.6%, one of the highest in the country, with poverty and migration being the by-product of the joblessness among youths.

“There should be a provision by the Election Commission that if someone makes such tall promises in their poll campaign and fails to fulfil them after being voted to power, their election must be declared null and void”, said Indrajeet Singh, who works part-time at a petrol pump in Sasaram.

Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s daughter and Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s vice-president Maryam Nawaz was on Tuesday booked along with more than 2,000 party members for holding an anti-government rally in Lahore.

The rally by the 11-member Opposition alliance Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was held here on October 16 before the Gujranwala public meeting.

Ms. Maryam had openly called Prime Minister Imran Khan a “coward, selected and puppet” in the rally, saying he hid behind the Army to cover up his nalaaiki (bad governance).

She dared the “selected” Prime Minister to arrest her as she is not afraid of going to jail.

The Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.

Husband named in FIR

The First Information Report (FIR) was registered for chanting slogans against the government and the state institutions, causing trouble for citizens, blocking roads, using loudspeakers and microphones, and violating coronavirus standard operating procedures.

Ms. Maryam’s husband Capt. (retd) Mohammad Safdar was also named in the FIR. He was earlier arrested in Karachi for allegedly violating the sanctity of Quaid-e-Azam mausoleum. He was later released on bail.

According to the FIR, Ms. Maryam was accused of instigating the party leaders and workers to get ready to send Mr. Khan’s government home.

Earlier, the Lahore police had registered a sedition case against Mr. Sharif and others for speaking against the Army and judiciary while addressing the party meeting via a video link from London.

Russia said on Tuesday it was ready to offer the U.S. a mutual one-year freeze on the number of nuclear warheads held by both countries in order to extend a landmark arms reduction deal due to expire next year.

“Russia offers to extend the New START by one year and is ready to take on a political commitment with the United States to freeze the number of nuclear warheads both sides have for this period,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin last week proposed extending by one year the New START treaty, which caps the number of nuclear warheads held by Washington and Moscow and expires on February 5, 2021.

The White House described the proposal as a “non-starter” unless accompanied by a freeze on the number of nuclear warheads.

Thousands of protesters have massed in the capital for daily demonstrations, flouting a ban imposed late last week prohibiting gatherings of more than four people.

They are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha, who was first brought to power in a military coup and reform of the kingdom's powerful monarchy.

24,2020/10/20,"Quad should eventually become formalised, says top U.S. Official","“The Quad is still a somewhat undefined entity in and of itself. And so it's a little premature to even talk about the question of expanding the Quad.”

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun has said that eventually the Quad group of countries — India, the U.S., Japan and Australia — should become more formalised once the parameters of cooperation were understood. His statement comes days after the Defence Ministry announced that Australia will join the other three Quad countries in the Malabar naval exercises, three years after it had requested to participate in the exercise.

“I will say that it is our view that in the passage of time, the Quad should become more regularized and at some point formalized as well as we really begin to understand what the parameters of this cooperation are and how we can regularize it,” Mr Biegun said on a briefing call to reporters on Wednesday.

“That's very important because the type of cooperation that we would gain in the Quad and ultimately in working with other countries in the Indo-Pacific is to have the practice of cooperation in place when we face a crisis, whether that comes in terms of natural disaster, economics, or even security.”

Mr. Biegun, who is the second highest U.S. State Department official, was discussing his trip to India and South Asia last week and responding to a question on whether South Korea had been asked to join a “Quad plus” (expanded Quad) grouping. Mr Biegun said there is no policy to expand the Quad.

The Quad has been viewed by Beijing with suspicion — and India had been reluctant to include Australia in the Malabar exercise out of concern that it would be viewed as a strategy to contain China. The India-China relationship is under the highest strain it has seen in recent decades following deadly clashes this summer along the Line of Actual Control.

“Yeah, let me slightly quibble with the underlying question that there's no, there's no designed policy for Quad expansion that is being advocated by the United States. In fact, our view is that there are a number of associations …among the Indo-Pacific nations that are worth reinforcing...,” he said.

“And also I want to importantly underscore that the real value…in fact the genesis of the Quad is cooperative action in areas outside of security. The Quad started with the combined effort to respond to a natural disaster [ the December 2004 Tsunami]. And over time it's maintained, it is strong and even perhaps overwhelming element of cooperation in areas outside of the security realm, including economics, including people to people, but also other forms …” Mr. Beigun said, adding that the Quad is still a “somewhat undefined entity.”

“The Quad is still a somewhat undefined entity in and of itself. And so it's a little premature to even talk about the question of expanding the Quad.”

“That said there's a natural affinity among a number of nations in the Indo Pacific. For example, you would have seen…I think it's probably known that that when, when I referenced the regular engagement and cooperation between the United States in India over many, many months to coordinate actions in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic and also to plan the recovery, it wasn't just the Indian and United States deputy foreign ministers who were participating in that. We were also joined on a weekly basis by counterparts from Japan, Republic of Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand and Australia,” he said.

“But even that is not any sort of naturally defined group. I think there's an opportunity, certainly under in the U S view under the Indo-Pacific strategy for close engagement, among many, many other partners, including other countries in South Asia, like Bangladesh and … ASEAN nations as well, “he said.

“What you want to do is to have a certain modality of cooperation of interoperability of understanding the respective strengths that each partner can bring in facing any number of global challenges,” he said.

“So I'm not necessarily advocating for a ‘Quad plus’, but rather a continuation and regularization of the Quad with an eventual goal of understanding how it could be best formalized. And then also of course, welcoming a cooperation with any country in the Indo-Pacific that's committed to defending a free and open Indo-Pacific that guarantees sovereignty and prosperity for its members,” Mr. Biegun said.

On how a change in the U.S. administration would impact the U.S.-India relationship, Mr Biegun said that all presidents since Bill Clinton had left the U.S.-India relationship in better shape than they had found it.

“The real opening the United States and India began under president Clinton. It accelerated under president Bush and continued under president Obama. And it's accelerating again under …President Trump,” he said.

“…Every presidential administration here in the United States has left the relationship in even better shape than the one that inherited from its predecessor. And that is an amazing legacy.”

Mr. Biegun cited reasons for this including the two countries’ democratic systems, diaspora linkages and private sector engagement. He also said “negative incentives” were one of the factors driving the countries to make “very sound judgements about our interests.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/esc2su/article32903107.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIAUSBIEGUN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/quad-should-eventually-become-formalised-says-top-us-official/article32903108.ece
25,2020/10/20,U.S. Justice Dept. to file landmark antitrust case against Google,"Lawmakers and consumer advocates have long accused Google, whose corporate parent Alphabet Inc. has a market value just over $1 trillion

The Justice Department is expected to file a lawsuit Tuesday alleging that Google has been abusing its online dominance in online search to stifle competition and harm consumers, a person familiar with the matter stated.

Also read: Google sued in U.S. for tracking 'private' internet use

The litigation marks the government’s most significant act to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago. The suit could be an opening salvo ahead of other major government antitrust actions, given ongoing investigations of major tech companies including Apple, Amazon and Facebook at both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

Also read: The Hindu Explains | Has Google been misrepresenting data practices?

Lawmakers and consumer advocates have long accused Google, whose corporate parent Alphabet Inc. has a market value just over $1 trillion, of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits. Critics contend that multibillion-dollar fines and mandated changes in Google’s practices imposed by European regulators in recent years weren’t severe enough and that structural changes are needed for Google to change its conduct.

The case is expected to be filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., and will allege Google has been abusing its dominance in online search to stifle competition and harm consumers, the person familiar with the matter told the AP. It will also allege that Google uses billions of dollars collected from advertisers to pay phone manufacturers to ensure Google is the default search engine on browsers, the person said. The person could not discuss the matter publicly before a formal announcement expected later Tuesday morning and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.

The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to President Donald Trump said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Mr. Trump has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.

Google controls about 90% of global web searches. The company has been bracing for the government’s action and is expected to fiercely oppose any attempt to force it to spin off its services into separate businesses.

The company, based in Mountain View, California, has long denied the claims of unfair competition. Google argues that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives.

Most of Google’s services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps it sell its ads. Google insists that it holds no special power forcing people to use its free services or preventing them from going elsewhere.

A recent report from a House Judiciary subcommittee, following a year-long investigation into Big Tech’s market dominance, concluded that Google has monopoly power in the market for search. It said the company established its position in several markets through acquisition, snapping up successful technologies that other businesses had developed - buying an estimated 260 companies in 20 years.

The argument for reining in Google has gathered force as the company stretched far beyond its 1998 roots as a search engine governed by the motto “Don’t Be Evil.” It’s since grown into a diversified goliath with online tentacles that scoop up personal data from billions of people via services ranging from search, video and maps to smartphone software. That data helps feed the advertising machine that has turned Google into a behemoth.

The company owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world’s largest smartphone operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system. Some critics have singled out YouTube and Android as among Google businesses that should be considered for divestiture.

With only two weeks to Election Day, the Trump Justice Department is taking bold legal action against Google on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement. Republicans and Democrats have accelerated their criticism of Big Tech in recent months, although sometimes for different reasons. It’s unclear what the status of the government’s suit against Google would be if a Joe Biden administration were to take over next year.

The Justice Department sought support for its suit from states across the country that share concerns about Google’s conduct. A bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago they were investigating Google’s business practices, citing “potential monopolistic behavior.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/xhe38e/article32121100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18NETGOOGLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/justice-dept-to-file-landmark-antitrust-case-against-google/article32901989.ece
26,2020/10/20,Constitutional amendment needs referendum: Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court,"Sri Lanka’s top court identifies clauses in legislation that need public approval.

The controversial 20th Amendment aimed at enhancing the Sri Lankan President’s powers cleared its first hurdle when the country’s Supreme Court cleared it for passage. However, it identified four clauses that is said would require approval by the people at a referendum.

The Hindu Explains | What is the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, and why is it contentious?

Informing Parliament of the top court’s position on Tuesday, the Speaker said the proposed sections, including those exempting the President from being answerable to Parliament and providing him immunity from lawsuits, were against public sovereignty, and therefore needed approval in a public referendum, unless the sections are amended in line with the apex court’s determination.

The Supreme Court’s determination came consequent to 39 petitions filed by opposition parties and civil society groups, challenging the 20th Amendment Bill, based on arguments that “it impacts the sovereignty of the people” and seeks to make the judiciary and legislature “subservient” to the executive.

Unbridled powers

Following up on its poll promise, the Rajapaksa administration introduced the 20th Amendment Bill in order to roll back the 19th Amendment, a 2015 legislation that clipped presidential powers and empowered Parliament.

Repeal and reform: On Sri Lankan Constitution

As per the proposed Bill, the President will have unbridled powers, while the Prime Minister’s office will be reduced to a ceremonial one. Though opposition parties have expressed fear that the Bill threatens to reduce the legislature to a “rubberstamp Parliament”, wider Opposition emerged more recently, including from members of the influential Buddhist clergy, Catholic bishops and the National Christian Council.

While it remains to be seen what amendments the government might bring in, the Bill will be debated in Parliament on Wednesday and Thursday. If the four provisions cited by the Supreme Court are suitably amended, the Bill can be passed with a two-thirds majority.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/u8sc6d/article30341489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LANKA-SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/constitutional-amendment-needs-referendum-sri-lankas-supreme-court/article32900856.ece
27,2020/10/20,Philippine President says he can be held responsible for drug killings,"Nearly 6,000 killings of drug suspects have been reported by police but rights watchdogs suspect the death toll is far larger.

The Philippine President has said he has no problem with being held responsible for the many killings under his anti-drugs crackdown, adding that he was ready to face charges that could land him in jail, though not charges of crimes against humanity.

President Rodrigo Duterte’s televised remarks on Monday night were among his clearest acknowledgement of the prospects that he could face a deluge of criminal charges for the bloody campaign he launched after taking office in mid-2016.

Nearly 6,000 killings of drug suspects have been reported by police but rights watchdogs suspect the death toll is far larger.

“If there’s killing there, I’m saying I’m the one ... you can hold me responsible for anything, any death that has occurred in the execution of the drug war,” Mr. Duterte said.

“If you get killed it’s because I’m enraged by drugs,” the tough-talking president said. “If that’s what I’m saying, bring me to court to be imprisoned. Fine, I have no problem. If I serve my country by going to jail, gladly,” he added.

At least two complaints for crimes against humanity and mass murder in connection with Mr. Duterte’s campaign are being examined by an International Criminal Court prosecutor, who will determine whether there is enough evidence to open a full-scale investigation.

Mr. Duterte responded to the complaints by withdrawing the Philippines from the world tribunal two years ago in a move that human rights groups said was a major setback in the country’s battle against impunity.

The ICC prosecutor has said the examination into the drug killings would continue despite the Philippine withdrawal.

Mr. Duterte asked on Monday when did “drugs become humanity?” He framed his remarks by portraying the drug menace as a national security and public threat like the decades-long communist insurgency that the government is obligated to quell.

“If this is allowed to go on and on and if no decisive action is taken against them, it will endanger the security of the state,” said Mr. Duterte, a former government prosecutor.

“When you save your country from the perdition of the people like the NPAs and drugs, you are doing a sacred duty,” he said, referring to communist New People’s Army insurgents.

There are 1.6 million drug addicts in the Philippines, Mr. Duterte said, citing statistics from an anti-narcotics agency. The figure is much smaller than the 4 million addicts that he cited the police as reporting early in his presidency to justify his crackdown.

Police have reported at least 5,856 drug suspects to have been killed in raids and more than 2,56,000 others arrested since the start of the crackdown. Human rights groups have accused authorities of considerably under reporting the deaths.

Mr. Duterte said drug killings that did not happen during police operations should not be blamed on him, adding those deaths may have been set off by gang rivalries or settling of scores.

There have been widespread suspicions of extrajudicial killings in the crackdown, allegations that Mr. Duterte and the police deny.

In 2018, a court convicted three police officers of murdering a 17-year-old student after witnesses and a security video disproved their claim that the suspect was shot after violently resisting, a common reason cited by police officers after drug suspects are killed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/czo8cm/article28652607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PHILIPPINESDUTERTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/philippine-president-says-he-can-be-held-responsible-for-drug-killings/article32900579.ece
28,2020/10/20,U.K. to begin ‘human challenge’ trials to speed up COVID-19 vaccine hunt,"If approved by regulators and the ethics committee, the studies would start in January next year with results expected by May 2021

Around 90 volunteers will be recruited to be exposed to small amounts of the novel coronavirus in a controlled setting for the first stage of “human challenge” trials to try and speed up the hunt for a viable COVID-19 vaccine, the U.K. government said on Tuesday.

It comes with a 33.6 million pound investment for experts from the National Health Service (NHS), academia and the private sector to join forces to make the U.K. among the first countries in the world to explore and establish human challenge trials to accelerate the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.

If approved by regulators and the ethics committee, the studies would start in January next year with results expected by May 2021.

“We are doing everything we can to fight coronavirus, including backing our best and brightest scientists and researchers in their hunt for a safe and effective vaccine,” said U.K. Business Secretary Alok Sharma.

“The funding announced today for these ground-breaking but carefully controlled studies marks an important next step in building on our understanding of the virus and accelerating the development of our most promising vaccines which will ultimately help in beginning our return to normal life,” he said.

In human challenge studies, a vaccine candidate that has proven to be safe in initial trials is given to a small number of carefully selected healthy adult volunteers, who are then exposed to the virus in a safe and controlled environment. Medics and scientists then closely monitor the effect on volunteers 24 hours per day to see exactly how the vaccine works and to identify any side effects.

Using controlled doses of virus, the aim of the research team will initially be to discover the smallest amount of virus it takes to cause COVID-19 infection in small groups of healthy young people, aged between 18 and 30, who are at the lowest risk of harm.

Up to 90 volunteers, who will be compensated for the time they spend in the study, could be involved at this stage, the U.K. government said without revealing the payment involved for the volunteers.

“Human challenge studies can increase our understanding of COVID-19 in unique ways and accelerate development of the many potential new COVID-19 treatments and vaccines,” said Dr Chris Chiu, from the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London and lead researcher on the human challenge study.

“Our number one priority is the safety of the volunteers. My team has been safely running human challenge studies with other respiratory viruses for over 10 years. No study is completely risk free, but the Human Challenge Programme partners will be working hard to ensure we make the risks as low as we possibly can,” he said.

The studies are conducted under strict conditions — these include a controlled entrance to the facility, careful decontamination of waste and a dedicated laboratory for carrying out tests, all of which help to ensure the study is delivered safely and securely. All the air leaving the unit is also cleaned so there is no risk to anyone outside the unit.

“This research will improve understanding of the virus, the biology of the disease, the signs that a person is protected from infection or developing the disease, the vaccine candidates, and will help in making decisions about research, that it is carried out safely and based on up-to-date evidence, said Kate Bingham, Chair of the government’s Vaccine Taskforce.

While the U.K. hopes to be the first to begin these human challenge studies, the proposed research must first be considered by regulators including the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the NHS Health Research Authority through research ethics committees before the research starts.

England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said a safe, fully approved, and meticulously controlled human challenge model for COVID-19 may help in the search for safe and effective vaccines.

“First, for the many vaccines still in the mid-stages of development, human challenge studies may help pick out the most promising ones to take forward into larger Phase 3 trials, said Mr. Van-Tam.

Second, for vaccines which are in the late stages of development and already proven to be safe and effective through Phase 3 studies, human challenge studies could help us further understand if the vaccines prevent transmission as well as preventing illness, he said.

The first stage of the Human Challenge Programme will be delivered by a partnership between Imperial College London, the Royal Free Hospital’s specialist and secure research unit in London and clinical company hVIVO, which is considered a pioneer in viral human challenge models.

“Our subsidiary hVIVO is the world leader in the testing of vaccines and antivirals using human challenge studies and our contract with the U.K. government to develop a COVID-19 human challenge study model will safely accelerate the discovery of effective vaccines and antivirals against COVID-19,” said Cathal Friel, Executive Chairman of Open Orphan, hVIVO’s parent company.

The study will take place in “world-class clinical facilities” at the Royal Free Hospital, specifically designed to contain the virus. Highly trained medics and scientists will be on hand to carefully examine how the virus behaves in the body and to ensure volunteer safety. Volunteers will be monitored for up to a year after participating in the study to ensure their long-term well-being.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xb3w42/article31744781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSBRITAIN-BRIEFING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-to-begin-human-challenge-trials-to-speed-up-covid-19-vaccine-hunt/article32900433.ece
29,2020/10/20,Pakistan fails to protect religious minorities from forced conversions: Parliamentary committee,"The parliamentary committee on forced religious conversions headed by Senator Anwarul Haq Kakar recently visited parts of Sindh where forced conversions of young Hindu girls have been reported

A parliamentary committee in Pakistan has said that the country has not fulfilled its responsibility to protect religious minorities from forced conversions, according to a media report on Tuesday.

The parliamentary committee on forced religious conversions headed by Senator Anwarul Haq Kakar recently visited parts of Sindh where forced conversions of young Hindu girls have been reported.

During a media interaction on Monday, Mr. Kakar said that “the state has not fulfilled its responsibility to protect religious minorities from forced conversions”, The Dawn News reported.

He, however, noted that most of the cases of conversions “have some degree of willingness”.

Replying to a question, Mr. Kakar said there are several definitions of forced conversion, and the subject was debated by the committee at length.

“Although conversion to seek a better lifestyle is also considered forced conversion, economic reasons can be considered exploitation and not force, as eventually it is after consent,” he said, adding that there is a thin line between consent and exploitation.

Mr. Kakar said people who “encourage girls from the Hindu community to move out and marry according to their own wishes are not as liberal about their own daughters”.

The worst part of the situation, he said, was that the family’s “pain and shame” were not taken into consideration.

“If we all start taking the families into confidence and devise a mechanism to console them, the cases of forced conversions will decline,” he said.

Mr. Kakar suggested introducing a new marriage rule that includes the mandatory presence of a ‘vali’ (guardian) at the time of wedding and the establishment of shelters managed by the district administration to house underage girls who wanted to get married, in order to clear the confusion between force and consent.

According to the report, the most vulnerable districts for forced conversions are Sanghar, Ghotki, Sukkur, Khairpur and Mirpurkhas. There have been negligible reported cases from Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while a few cases involving Christians have been reported in Punjab.

Civil society activist Krishan Sharma said there are two kinds of forced conversions, the first involving kidnapping and illegal confinement, and a second kind that is rampant in Sindh and has to be taken care of by the state - “this is procedural forced conversions, [in which] the whole system of the country, from the police, the courts, etc, are violating the laws and facilitating such conversions,” the report quoted Mr. Sharma as saying.

“When the parents present a certificate that the age of the girl is below 18 years, the police usually do not attach this document in the FIR, but we have women protection laws in the country and we need to implement them. Besides that, Pakistan is signatory to several international obligations,” he said.

Mr. Sharma said there has to be a law stating that the minimum age for religious conversion is 18, which is also the marriageable age in Sindh. The courts too should take note of marriages of girls below the age of 18 years, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-fails-to-protect-religious-minorities-from-forced-conversions-parliamentary-committee/article32899859.ece
30,2020/10/20,Donald Trump says Sudan to be removed from terrorism list if it follows through on pledge to pay compensation,"Sudan has agreed to pay compensation for victims of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, attacks conducted by Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida network while he was living in Sudan

President Donald Trump on Monday said Sudan will be removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism if it follows through on its pledge to pay $335 million to American terror victims and their families, but some hurt in the attacks weren’t happy with the deal.

The move would open the door for the African country to get international loans and aid needed to revive its battered economy and rescue the country’s transition to democracy.

The announcement, just two weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election, also comes as the Trump administration works to get other Arab countries, such as Sudan, to join the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain’s recent recognition of Israel.

Delisting Sudan from the state sponsors blacklist is a key incentive for the Sudanese government to normalize relations with Israel. Mr. Trump’s announcement came after Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin travelled to Bahrain to cement the Gulf state’s recognition of the Jewish state.

Mr. Trump tweeted: “GREAT news! New government of Sudan, which is making great progress, agreed to pay $335 MILLION to U.S. terror victims and families. Once deposited, I will lift Sudan from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. At long last, JUSTICE for the American people and BIG step for Sudan!”

News Analysis | What’s next for Palestine after UAE, Bahrain deals with Israel?

Sudan has agreed to pay compensation for victims of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, attacks conducted by Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida network while bin Laden was living in Sudan.

Gen. Abdel-Farrah Burhan, head of Sudan’s ruling sovereign council, welcomed Mr. Trump’s announcement as a constructive step .

He said in a tweet the removal would come “in recognition of the historic change that has taken place in Sudan”.

Sudan is on a fragile path to democracy after a popular uprising last year led the military to overthrow autocratic leader Omar al-Bashir in April 2019. A military-civilian government now rules the country, with elections possible in late 2022.

In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said getting off the list would help his government benefit from debt relief and access foreign loans and investments, which are seen as the country’s gateway to economic recovery. The country has more than $60 billion in foreign debt, he said.

Editorial | Sudan’s troubles

“It’s a long way,” he said. “It needs serious planning and hard work to achieve the maximum benefit of this opportunity”.

Once the compensation money has been deposited, Mr. Trump is to sign an order removing Sudan from the terrorism list, on which it has languished under heavy American sanctions for 27 years.

Congress is then expected to act to restore Sudan’s sovereign immunity, which would effectively stop future compensation claims from being filed against it in US courts.

Meanwhile, Sudan is to begin the process of normalising relations with Israel, possibly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joining a congratulatory phone call between Trump and Hamdok.

The designation of Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism dates back to the 1990s, when Sudan briefly hosted bin Laden and other wanted militants. Sudan was also believed to have served as a pipeline for Iran to supply weapons to Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.

The state sponsors of terrorism designation is one of the U.S. government’s most effective sanctions tools and bars virtually all non-humanitarian U.S. transactions with countries on it. It was created in 1979 to punish nations that fund or otherwise support terrorist acts. With Sudan’s removal, only Iran, North Korea and Syria will remain on the list.

Some victims denounced he settlement; others urged Congress to pass legislation needed to implement the agreement.

More than 500 of the 700 victims of the 1998 bombings at the U.S. embassies signed a letter rejecting Sudan’s settlement offer, partly because it would award more money to Americans than Africans who worked there.

The letter said the plan offers compensation dependent on a victim’s nation of birth, rather than the severity of injuries.

This scheme would pay nothing at all to nearly a third of the embassy victims and categorises naturalised U.S. citizens as non-Americans, the letter said. It sets the value of the life of a U.S. embassy employee born in Africa at only 8% of an employee born in America.

Jack Quinn, counsel for the 9/11 families that sued Sudan, also expressed displeasure at the announcement.

“The 9/11 families are counting on Congress to reject Sudan’s plea that our pending lawsuits be wiped out, and they insist it do nothing that would undermine them,” Mr. Quinn said.

However, Edith Bartley, spokesperson for the families of the Americans killed in the embassy bombing in Nairobi, Kenya, thanked the State Department and the new government in Sudan for securing compensation for the victims.

She said that once released, the compensation will fulfil a longstanding commitment to the victims first made by President George W. Bush, honoured by President Barack Obama and now affirmed by Mr.Trump.

We urge Congress to immediately pass the legislation that is needed to implement the agreement, and begin the payment process, she said. Congress cannot let this agreement fall victim to legislative gridlock and bickering. The victims, and our regional allies who wish to have Sudan emerge as a economically viable supporter of regional peace, are depending on Congress to act swiftly in support of this effort.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/km8ecz/article31022978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUDANPM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-says-sudan-to-be-removed-from-terrorism-list-if-it-follows-through-on-pledge-to-pay-compensation/article32898798.ece
31,2020/10/20,17 individuals and organisations file H-1B lawsuit against U.S. Department of Labour,"The lawsuit alleged that the poorly-drafted and improperly-issued rule did not comply with the procedural rules for rule-making and is substantively arbitrary, incorrect and irrational

Seventeen individuals and organisations, including universities and businesses, have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Labour challenging its recent Interim Final Rule on wages related to H-1B visas.

The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday alleged that the poorly-drafted and improperly-issued rule did not comply with the procedural rules for rule-making and is substantively arbitrary, incorrect and irrational.

The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. It is most sought-after among Indian IT professionals.

Also read | Democrats flay Trump for announcing new curbs on H-1B visas sans public scrutiny

“The increase to the prevailing wages will manifestly not benefit US economic growth or any workers; study after study has shown that H-1B visa holders create American jobs,” Jesse Bless, director of federal litigation at the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), claimed.

The regulation, he said, has caused immediate and unnecessary harm in every corner of the economy, including academic institutions, non-profits, hospitals, start-ups and small businesses.

“Frankly, the last thing we need during a (COVID-19) pandemic and economic turmoil is a rule based on a false and incorrect understanding of the market and American workforce. This will impede our economic recovery, not enhance it, Bless said.

Early this month, the Department of Labour published a rule to appropriately identify wage levels for H-1B holders and other foreign labour programmes, which according to the White House will improve the quality of H-1B workers and better reflect wages paid to similarly employed workers in the U.S.

The rule will limit an employer’s ability to replace workers with cheap foreign labour and help ensure wages are not suppressed by the presence of low-cost foreign workers, the White House argued.

Among those who have filed the lawsuit are Purdue University, University of Michigan, University of Denver, Chapman University, Bard College, International Institute of New England, Information Technology Industry Council, Arizona State University, Scripps College, Northern Arizona University, Indiana University, Study Mississippi, Dentists for America, Physicians for American Healthcare and Hodges Bonded Warehouse.

Jeff Joseph, Senior Partner of Joseph and Hall, in a statement alleged that dealing with the Department of Labour often feels like “The Hunger Games“.

“Everyone is required to play the game, but no one knows the rules and the rules are constantly changing. This is not a game. The fact that the rule was made effective without thinking about the destructive impact it would have on industries and the economy illustrates how out of touch this administration is regarding the symbiotic relationship between legal immigration and the economy,” he said.

“The days when the federal government blatantly ignores the law in its rule-making are over,” said Charles Kuck, managing partner of Kuck Baxter Immigration.

U.S. universities, employers, and healthcare systems can no longer stand by and watch while the U.S. immigration system is dismantled by a nativist administration and in contravention of federal law, he said.

“Aside from the blatantly unlawful way, the Department of Labour dropped this rule on the economy, its basic premise is also wholly incorrect,” alleged Greg Siskind, founding partner of Siskind Susser.

“The workers impacted are in occupations with extraordinarily low unemployment. And as we show in the complaint, these outstanding immigrants are doing critical work benefiting everyday Americans, whether it is providing critical research to cure disease, making our country globally competitive, providing medical and dental care to rural Americans, or caring for our country’s senior citizens,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tczvjf/article32263809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/H1B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/17-individuals-and-organisations-file-h-1b-lawsuit-against-us-department-of-labour/article32898485.ece
32,2020/10/20,"US presidential elections | Trump attacks polls, press and Fauci","On the third day of a western campaign swing, the President was facing intense pressure to turn around his campaign

An angry President Donald Trump came out swinging Monday against Dr. Anthony Fauci, the press and polls that show him trailing Democrat Joe Biden in key battleground states in a disjointed closing message two weeks out from Election Day.

On the third day of a western campaign swing, Mr. Trump was facing intense pressure to turn around his campaign, hoping for the type of last-minute surge that gave him a come-from-behind victory four years ago. But his inconsistent message, another rise in virus cases and his attacks on experts like Fauci could undermine his final efforts to appeal to voters outside his most loyal base.

""I’m not running scared,” Mr. Trump told reporters before taking off for Tucson, Arizona, for his fifth rally in three days. “I think I’m running angry. I’m running happy and I’m running very content ‘cause I’ve done a great job.”

""We’re going to win,” he told campaign staff on a morning conference call from Las Vegas. He went on to acknowledge that he “wouldn’t have told you that maybe two or three weeks ago,” referring to the days when he was hospitalized with COVID-19. But he said he felt better now than at any point in 2016. “We’re in the best shape we’ve ever been,” he said.

Seeking to shore up the morale of his staff amid growing private concerns that he is running out of time to make up lost ground, Mr. Trump blasted his government’s own scientific experts as too negative, even as his handling of the pandemic that has killed nearly 220,000 Americans remains a central issue to voters.

""People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,” Mr. Trump said of the government’s top infectious disease expert. “Every time he goes on television, there’s always a bomb. But there’s a bigger bomb if you fire him. But Fauci’s a disaster.”

At a rally in Prescott, Arizona, Mr. Trump assailed Mr. Biden for pledging to heed the advice of scientific experts, saying dismissively that his rival “wants to listen to Dr. Fauci.”

The doctor is both respected and popular, and Mr. Trump’s rejection of scientific advice on the pandemic has already drawn bipartisan condemnation.

Steps up attack on new media

At his rally, Mr. Trump also ramped up his attacks on the news media, singling out NBC’s Kristen Welker, the moderator of the next presidential debate, as well as CNN for aggressively covering a pandemic that is now infecting tens of thousands of Americans every day.

Fauci, in an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday, said he was not surprised that Mr. Trump contracted the virus after he held a series of large events with few face coverings.

""I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded, no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask,” Fauci said of the president.

Mr. Biden was off the campaign trail Monday, but his campaign praised Fauci and criticized Mr. Trump for “reckless and negligent leadership” that “threatens to put more lives at risk.”

""Mr. Trump’s closing message in the final days of the 2020 race is to publicly mock Joe Mr. Biden for trusting science and to call Dr. Fauci, the leading public health official on COVID-19, a ‘disaster’ and other public health officials ‘idiots,’” the campaign said.

Monday’s professed confidence in victory stood in contrast to some of Mr. Trump’s other public comments in recent days reflecting on the prospect that he could lose.

""Could you imagine if I lose my whole life? What am I going to do?” he asked a rally crowd last week in Macon, Georgia. “I’m not going to feel so good. Maybe I’ll have to leave the country. I don’t know.”

Mr. Biden, meanwhile, was in Delaware for several days of preparation ahead of Thursday’s final presidential debate. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, returned to the campaign trail after several days in Washington after a close adviser tested positive for the coronavirus.

Late Monday, the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced that Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden will each have his microphone cut off in Thursday’s debate while his rival delivers his opening two-minute answer to each of the six debate topics.

The rule changes come three weeks after a chaotic opening faceoff between the two presidential contenders that featured frequent interruptions - most often by Mr. Trump. The open discussion portion of the debate will not feature a mute button, but interruptions by either candidate will count toward their time.

The commission has faced pressure from the Mr. Trump campaign to avoid changing the rules, while Mr. Biden’s team was hoping for a more ordered debate. In a statement, the commission said it “had determined that it is appropriate to adopt measures intended to promote adherence to agreed upon rules and inappropriate to make changes to those rules.”

Mr. Trump’s campaign said he would participate in the debate despite his concerns about the new rule.

""I just think it’s very unfair,” Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned from Arizona. “I will participate but it’s very unfair that they changed the topics and it’s very unfair that again, we have an anchor who’s totally biased.”

In addition to public polling that indicates Mr. Biden has an edge, the former vice president enjoys another considerable advantage- money.

Over the past four months, Mr. Biden has raised over $1 billion, a massive amount of money that has significantly eclipsed Mr. Trump’s once-overwhelming cash advantage.

That’s become apparent in advertising, where Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies are on pace to spend twice as much as Mr. Trump and the Republicans in the closing days of the race, according to data from the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.

""We have more than sufficient air cover, almost three times as much as 2016,” said Mr. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, who insisted Mr. Trump has the advantage with the campaign’s field staff and data targeting.

Though Mr. Trump has pulled back from advertising in Midwestern states that secured his 2016 win, he’s invested heavily elsewhere, including North Carolina, where he is on pace to slightly outspend Mr. Biden.

Concerns about a possible loss to Mr. Biden that have been spilling into the open in recent days have been percolating behind the scenes at the Mr. Trump campaign. Mr. Trump himself has alternated between disbelief and anger at the idea that he could lose to a candidate whom he views as washed up and incompetent, according to three campaign and White House officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.

Mr. Trump has directed anger at press coverage but also has vented about his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, whom he blames for mishandling his hospitalization for the virus and COVID relief talks.

Meanwhile, aides have started privately wondering whether or not Mr. Trump’s campaign rallies, which have helped define American politics for the last five years, were in their final days.

In recent weeks, meanwhile, some White House staff offices have also tried to rotate in aides who have never flown on Air Force One or have done so infrequently so they can do so before Election Day.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ivye2k/article32898135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-elections-trump-attacks-polls-press-and-fauci/article32898136.ece
33,2020/10/20,Coronavirus cases in Argentina cross 1 million,"The country has seen cases spiral despite instituting one of the world’s longest lockdowns

At the edge of Argentina in a city known as “The End of the World,” many thought they might be spared from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.

Sitting far from the South American nation’s bustling capital, health workers in Ushuaia were initially able to contain a small outbreak among foreigners hoping to catch boats to the Antarctic at the start of the crisis.

Watch | Coronavirus: Can masks protect you?

But as Argentina passed 1 million virus cases Monday, it is now smaller cities like Ushuaia that are seeing some of the most notable upticks. Doctors have had to quadruple the number of beds for COVID-19 patients over the last month. At least 60% of those tested recently are coming back positive for the virus.

""We were the example of the country,” said Dr. Carlos Guglielmi, director of the Ushuaia Regional Hospital. “Evidently someone arrived with the coronavirus.”

Across Latin America, three other nations are expected to reach the 1 million case milestone in the coming weeks - Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The grim mark comes as Latin America continues to register some of the world’s highest daily case counts. And though some nations have seen important declines, overall there has been little relief, with cases dropping in one municipality only to escalate in another.

Download The Hindu’s multi-language e-book on essential COVID-19 information

The trajectory is showing that the pandemic is likely to leave no corner of Latin America unscathed.

""The second wave is arriving without ever having finished the first,” said Dr. Luis Jorge Hernŕndez, a public health professor at the University of the Andes in Colombia.

Argentina has seen cases spiral despite instituting one of the world’s longest lockdowns. Colombia’s major cities have seen a dip, but smaller areas like the department of Caldas in the coffee region are only now reaching a peak. Peru’s overall numbers have dropped, but officials recently reported 12 regions are spiking back up. Mexico, likewise, has seen a rise in a quarter of all states over the last week.

The result is that rather than a second virus wave like that being seen in Europe, epidemiologists anticipate a more sustained, plateau-like trend.

""Our countries are still getting out of the first wave,” said Dr. Marcos Espinal, director of the Pan American Health Organization’s Department of Communicable Diseases. “A great part of the population remains exposed and community transmission continues.”

The virus’ cruel path through Latin America is a consequence of weak public health systems, social factors like poverty and poor government decisions early on that resulted in flawed or limited testing and little contact tracing. Today the region is home to half the 10 countries with the highest total cases around the globe.

Argentina initially registered low virus case numbers but now has one of the highest rates of new daily infections per capita, according to Our World in Data, a non-profit online scientific publication based at the University of Oxford. It is on par with several European countries that are experiencing a resurgence of the virus.

Dr. Adolfo Rubinstein, a former Argentine health minister, said the nation depended too heavily on lockdowns as its primary means of controlling the virus, failing to purchase enough tests in the initial months of the pandemic.

Where the virus is appearing is also shifting. Initially, up to 90% of the confirmed cases were in metropolitan Buenos Aires. Today, 65% of Argentina’s cases are in its provinces and even faraway places like Ushuaia, authorities said.

""Now it is everywhere in the country,” Rubinstein said.

Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, director of the Americas branch of the World Health Organization, warned recently that the coronavirus is appearing in places that were previously not affected, with high numbers popping up in regions like the English-speaking Caribbean.

""In many countries, the pandemic has also moved to less populated areas,” she said.

That can be seen not just in Argentina but in Colombia as well. The city of Manizales in a region known for its coffee farms now registers 440.98 cases per 100,000 residents, far higher than the nationwide average of 284.09 per 100,000, according to the Ministry of Health. Officials say the slower rise in cases allowed them to expand ICU capacity.

""Here we didn’t have a peak like in Europe,” Hernŕndez said. “We had a plateau.”

Throughout the region, testing remains a hurdle. In Peru, officials have relied heavily on antibody tests to identify cases - even though the tests are not designed to make a diagnosis because they can only detect proteins that develop a week or more after infection. Argentina’s testing is still far below that of neighboring countries; on Sunday, just 13,890 were tested, compared to 31,988 the same day in Colombia.

The high percentage coming back positive in Argentina suggests the country is still likely missing vast numbers of infections.

Brazil reached 1 million cases in June and now is up to 5.2 million for the pandemic.

""These are huge undercounts of what is really going on in terms of numbers,” said Felicia Knaul, director of the Institute for Advanced Study of the Americas at the University of Miami. “We need more consistent mask use - but we have to couple that with testing and tracing - or else the numbers are going to rise tremendously.”

In Ushuaia, officials believe truckers carrying in produce from the Buenos AIres region may be responsible for the rise in cases since mid-September. The city famous as a departure point for cruises to the Antarctic had been a model for the nation. Closed off air travel and a halt on tourism left it virus free for months.

But that false sense of comfort may have led people to relax on basic pandemic norms like hand washing and social distancing. The Tierra del Fuego province, which has a population of about 150,000, now has over 8,000 confirmed cases.

In Ushuaia, anxious residents line up in their cars for drive-thru testing. A sports center that had been empty is now set up to take care of patients. One month ago, the regional hospital was treating just seven COVID-19 patients; now it has 28, occupying all of its bed set aside for adults with the illness.

""The failure in Argentina was the low amount of testing,” Guglielmi said.

Josş Bongiovanni, a lawyer in Ushuaia, said a worry that seemed distant now feels close.

""Living at the end of the world was never easy,” he said. “It’s a lot less easy in a moment like this.”

34,2020/10/20,U.S. Supreme Court permits crucial vote counting extension in Pennsylvania,"Republicans had approached the U.S.’s top court for an emergency stay on the extended counting period.

In a victory for Democrats, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to stay a Pennsylvania Supreme Court order allowing some postal ballots received for up to three days after Election Day (November 3) to be tallied provided they are postmarked by November 3. Republicans had approached the U.S.’s top court for an emergency stay on the extended counting period — a special accommodation for the pandemic.

The Hindu Explains | What is the debate around mail-in postal ballot system in U.S. presidendial polls?

Both U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden are hoping to win this crucial swing state which Mr. Biden is leading overall, as per polls. Mr Trump won the state by less than a percentage point in 2016.

A stay on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court order permitting extended counting would have needed the assent of at least five U.S. Supreme Court judges. With Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the liberal judges, the bench was tied four and four. As is normal for emergency rulings , no reasoning was provided by the court.

35,2020/10/20,Israel to start human trials of COVID vaccine candidate ‘Brilife’ towards October-end,"Defence Minister Benny Gantz on Monday visits lab and describes the process of beginning of human trials as a “very significant moment”

Israel has named its COVID-19 vaccine candidate ‘Brilife’ and its human trials will begin by October-end, according to an official press release.

The prospective vaccine is being developed by the Israel Institute of Biological Research (IIBR) that was established in 1952 as part of the Israel Defence Forces’ Science Corps, and later became a civilian organisation.

Israel had claimed in August that it already has the vaccine against the coronavirus “in hand” but it has to go through regulatory processes that would begin with human trials following the autumn holidays.

Defence Minister Benny Gantz on Monday visited the IIBR and described the process of beginning of human trials as a “very significant moment” and “source of national pride” that can bring great news for Israel and the rest of the world.

Mr. Gantz was briefed on relevant details related to the vaccine’s production and the anticipated timetable.

“We are at a very significant moment. The staff has done fantastic work. If the process is successful, it will be huge news for the state of Israel and maybe for the world. I’d like to thank the entire staff of researchers and administrators at the IIBR. You are a source of national pride,” the Defence Minister said.

IIBR Director Shmuel Shapira, during the Minister’s visit, unveiled the name of the prospective vaccine. ‘Brilife’ is a combination of the Hebrew word “Bri” (health) and “il” (the internet country code for Israel) and “life”.

“We set out nine months ago on February 2, and we are entering the final round at the end of October. The vaccine has a trade name “Brilife”, health, ‘il’ for the state of Israel, and life. We thank the minister of defence for his support, and we will continue to work for the health of the citizens of Israel, as well as for the Israeli economy and society”, Mr. Shapira said.

The IIBR chief, during Gantz previous visit in August to the institute, had announced that “there is an excellent vaccine, but there are regulatory processes that the vaccine needs to go through ... We will start safety and efficacy trials after the autumn holidays, but the product is in hand“.

The press release did not specify as to how long the human trials are likely to take and by when the vaccine would be ready for use.

In May, Israel announced that the IIBR, mandated to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, had made a “significant breakthrough” by wrapping up the development phase of the antibody and moving to patent and mass produce the potential treatment.

Earlier in March, Israeli daily Ha’aretz, quoting medical sources, had reported that scientists at the institute had made a significant breakthrough in understanding the biological mechanism and qualities of the virus, including better diagnostic capability, production of antibodies for those who already have the virus and development of a vaccine.

The IIBR is technically under the supervision of the Prime Minister’s Office, but works in close communication with the defence ministry.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is said to have asked the institute in February to devote resources to develop a vaccine for COVID-19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ecqofk/article32897506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDISRAEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-to-start-human-trials-of-covid-vaccine-candidate-brilife-towards-october-end/article32897507.ece

The head of emergencies at the World Health Organization says Asia’s follow-through in the fight against COVID-19 and its populations’ greater trust in and compliance with their governments have given the continent a leg up against the coronavirus.

As Europe grapples with big surges in case counts in recent days, Dr. Michael Ryan said that if he had one golden wish that might change the game, it would be to make sure that every contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case would undergo quarantine to break the chains of transmission.

Countries like China, South Korea and Japan, which had experience against earlier respiratory disease outbreaks, have been able to implement measures longer than their counterparts in places like Europe and North America that continued to struggle against the pandemic, he said.

38,2020/10/20,U.S. charges six Russian military officers in vast hacking campaign,"One of the accused was indicted previously in 2018, for attempting to gain access to U..S computers involved in the administration of the 2016 U.S. elections.

Six Russian military intelligence officers have been charged in the United States with carrying out cyberattacks on Ukraine's power grid, the 2017 French elections and the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, the Justice Department announced on Monday.

The six GRU agents were also accused of staging a malware attack called “NotPetya” that infected computers of businesses worldwide, causing nearly $1 billion in losses to three U.S. companies alone.

In addition, they allegedly targeted international investigations into the nerve agent poisoning of Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, as well as waged cyberattacks on media outlets and parliament in Georgia.

At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab accused Russian military intelligence services of carrying out internet reconnaissance missions against targets linked to the Tokyo Olympics, before they were postponed until 2021 by the coronavirus pandemic.

“The targets included the Games' organisers, logistics services and sponsors,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.

U.S. Assistant Attorney General John Demers said the six officers were responsible for “the most disruptive and destructive series of computer attacks ever attributed to a single group.”

Mr. Demers said members of the same GRU unit have been charged previously with seeking to disrupt the 2016 US elections -- but there were “no (2020) election interference allegations” in this indictment.

The indictment of the six, none of whom are in US custody, was brought by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where hospitals were allegedly targeted by the NotPetya hackers.

The charges include conspiracy to conduct computer fraud and abuse, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, damaging protected computers, and aggravated identity theft.

Mr. Demers said the defendants launched destructive malware attacks against the electric power grid in Ukraine in December 2015 and December 2016.

“These were the first reported destructive malware attacks against the control systems of civilian critical infrastructure,” he said.

“These attacks turned out the lights and turned off the heat in the middle of the Eastern European winter, as the lives of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men, women and children went dark and cold.”

'Petulant child'

The Justice Department said the defendants conducted “hack-and-leak” campaigns against French President Emmanuel Macron's political party and local French governments prior to the 2017 elections.

Demers said the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea were targeted after Russian athletes were banned from participating under their own flag because of government-sponsored doping efforts.

“Their cyberattack combined the emotional maturity of a petulant child with the resources of a nation state,” he said, adding that they attempted to pin it on North Korea.

“During the opening ceremony, they launched the 'Olympic Destroyer' malware attack, which deleted data from thousands of computers supporting the Games, rendering them inoperable,” he said.

The 2017 NotPetya attacks were aimed at businesses and critical infrastructure worldwide, and US targets included hospitals, a subsidiary of delivery giant FedEx and a pharmaceutical manufacturer.

In April 2018, spear phishing campaigns were launched against investigations being carried out into the Skripal poisoning by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the United Kingdom's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL).

In Georgia, a spear phishing campaign was launched in 2018 against a major media company, and in 2019, efforts were made to compromise the computer network of the country's parliament, according to the Justice Department.

The six were identified as Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko, 32; Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov, 35; Pavel Valeryevich Frolov, 28; Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, 29, Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko, 27; and Petr Nikolayevich Pliskin, 32.

39,2020/10/20,Tsunami alert for Alaska after major 7.5 magnitude quake,"The level of tsunami danger is being evaluated, the agency warned

tsunami alert was issued on Monday after a major 7.5-magnitude quake struck off the coast of Alaska, U.S. agencies said.

The tsunami warning covers much of the southern coast of the remote U.S. state, including the thinly populated Alaska Peninsula, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The at-risk zone currently extends hundreds of miles northeast to the Cook Inlet, but stops just short of the state's largest city of Anchorage, located at the end of that gulf.

The “level of tsunami danger is being evaluated,” the agency warned.

The earthquake hit some 57 miles (92 km) from the small city of Sand Point, at a depth of 25 miles (40km), the U.S. Geological Survey said.

There was “a low likelihood of casualties and damage” from the quake itself, the USGS added.

The major quake was followed by at least four aftershocks of 5.0-magnitude or higher.

The earthquake was felt in the nearby Alaska Peninsula community of King Cove, but everything seemed to be intact, city administrator Gary Hennigh told the Anchorage Daily News.

“Residents and cannery workers are evacuating to higher ground until we know more about the tsunami warning,” Mr. Hennigh said.

Cold Bay resident Michael Ashley said the quake was “a pretty good ride.”

“All the couches, recliners and bookcases were moving around, and I had to pretty much hold one of them up,” he told the newspaper.

There was no immediately available information on possible casualties or damage elsewhere.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tsunami-alert-for-alaska-after-major-75-magnitude-quake/article32897213.ece
40,2020/10/20,‘Is romance dead?’ Comedian Kaneez Surka asks in her new podcast with Bumble,"In her new podcast ‘Is Romance Dead?’ produced by Bumble, comedian Kaneez Surka dissects how our ideas of courtship have evolved

In one of the funnier moments of Kaneez Surka’s new podcast, Is Romance Dead, the improv comedian considers changing her career to an international spy. “I can find out so much with so little information,” she says. “Who is that hottie you bumped into while buying baingan [brinjal]? Is that guy ghosting you or really doing a social detox?” — Kaneez masi will have the answers.

The episode, titled ‘Social media and romance’, in which she dissects if social media takes the magic and mystery out of dating, is the first in this series produced by Bumble. The podcast (which can be streamed in all platforms) sees Kaneez on a quest to understand the idea of romance through music, food, films, travel and books. Guests from different walks of life, include singers Vishal Dadlani and Nikhil D’Souza, chefs Ranveer Brar and Pooja Dhingra, filmmaker Alankrita Shrivastava, costume designer Neeta Lulla and more.

So, what is the result? Is romance dead? Kaneez answers with a laugh, “You know, I personally did believe that. Maybe not dead perhaps, just that we don’t have time for it. But the more I spoke to people, the more I realised that it’s not dead, it has just evolved.”

For over 50 years now, the westernised idea of romance — chocolates, flowers, violins — has elbowed its way into our imagination. “My understanding of romance had been the commercial version we have seen in pop culture,” she says, adding that this made her pit love against romance. “After over 20 interviews, I understood that there is a lot more to it.”

The podcast is divided into eight episodes of music; food; wedding; travel; film, TV and literature; social media; and mind, heart and body. In the film section, for instance, Kaneez speaks to Alankrita Shrivastava, Anupama Chopra and Anuja Chauhan about how chemistry is built between characters, what the common tropes are and the most iconic couples. The podcast also gets on board neurologists like Dr Siddharth Warrier to explore the biological and psychological aspects of falling in love.

“Everyone experiences romance differently,” says Kaneez, adding, that she especially loved observing how romantic people can get about their passion too. “You should hear Ranveer Brar describing his most romantic meal. ‘A dollop of ghee, a drizzle of chilli oil and crushed papadam’. I was like oh my God how do you make khichdi so sensual!”

But, with the easy availability of options on dating apps becoming greater than ever, do we value people lesser? Have our expectations from our partners changed?

“In one of the interviews, I did question if our fast-paced life of meeting so many new people was why romance was dying a little bit. But once it gets pointed out to you, you understand that no, it’s evolving for us to have more options. It is the same way not just with love, but also our careers; the things we buy. That is just the pace of the whole world, I am not saying it’s a good or a bad thing, but when everyone’s doing it, it becomes the culture,” she says.

As for our expectations, Kaneez believes they are more a result of age. “Marriage for instance, is not important anymore for me. Like, I am watching Tidying Up with Marie Kondo right now and I think I need a partner who can live a minimalist life and let go of things.

41,2020/10/20,Jeff Bridges reveals cancer diagnosis with lymphoma,"The 70-year-old Hollywood veteran, who shared the news on Twitter on Monday, assured fans that his “prognosis is good”

Oscar-winning actor Jeff Bridges has announced that he has been diagnosed with lymphoma, a kind of cancer.

The 70-year-old Hollywood veteran, who shared the news on Twitter on Monday, assured fans that his “prognosis is good.”

“As the Dude would say.. New S**T has come to light.”

“I have been diagnosed with Lymphoma. Although it is a serious disease, I feel fortunate that I have a great team of doctors and the prognosis is good,” Bridges said, referencing his iconic character from the Coen Brothers film “The Big Lebowski“.

Bridges further said he was starting treatment and will keep fans posted on his recovery.

“I’m profoundly grateful for the love and support from my family and friends,” he added.

According to the Chicago Sun Times, at the time of his diagnosis, Bridges was preparing a series for FX called “The Old Man”, on which he is the star and executive producer.

The actor-activist also urged the people to vote for the presidential elections due on November 3.

“Thank you for your prayers and well wishes. And, while I have you, please remember to go vote. Because we are all in this together,” he wrote on the microblogging site.

Bridges won an Oscar for playing a broken-down country singer in the 2009 film “Crazy Heart”, but for many, his career-defining role is of The Dude, a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler in “The Big Lebowski”, the 1998 crime comedy directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.

In his over six decade-long Hollywood career, the actor has played diverse parts in films like “Starman”, “The Contender”, “Iron Man”, “True Grit” and “Hell or High Water“.

At the 2019 Golden Globes ceremony, Bridges was honoured with the Cecil B deMille Award, which is given annually to a talented individual who has made a lasting impact on the world of entertainment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/9iwb29/article32898918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PEOPLEJEFFBRIDGES1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/jeff-bridges-reveals-cancer-diagnosis-with-lymphoma/article32898885.ece
42,2020/10/20,Kerala group of storytellers with a mission,"A group of storytellers in Kerala is creating a community of listeners one Malayalam story at a time

Oru Palathinte Katha (The Story of a Bridge) narrated by Anitha Ranjit is a story about how former Chairman and Managing Director of the Delhi Metro Rail E Sreedharan, at the time a young engineer, rebuilt Rameshwarams’ Pamban bridge in record time after a cyclone swept away most of it in 1964. The story, uploaded on September 28, is one of the popular ones told by the Facebook community of storytellers, Kadalakkadalas.

Among those who listened to it were descendants of khalasis, traditional boat builders from Malabar, who were part of rebuilding the bridge. They reached out to the team grateful for the recognition to their grandfathers’ contribution.

Kadalakkadalas, loosely translated, means ‘the paper wrapping of peanuts’, and the opening montage of each story shows peanuts being roasted seen through a torn newspaper. “Before throwing away the piece of paper peanuts come packed in, some of us read it out of curiosity. Each paper has a story and that resonated with what we wanted to do,” says founder of the group Racika Raman, a teacher trainer and passionate storyteller.

Kadalakkadalas has ‘told’ 40 stories since its launch on July 17.

Collaborating with Racika, on the project, are Anitha Ranjit, Geetha Ananth, Nishi Menon, Sangeetha Sreehari, Ninoj Abraham, and Smitha Nair. All the members attended a beginners’ course by Bengaluru-based Kathalaya, which has branches in various cities and organises storytelling courses across the country. Racika has its Kochi franchise.

Of fun and folk tales

The stories are drawn from diverse sources such as Kottarathil Sankunni’s Ithihyamala, Malayalam folk tales and even originals written by members. Calicut-based school teacher Sangeetha narrated Ente Swantham Upuma (My Own Upma), which she wrote. “If, in the future, we use stories with living authors, we would request permission to avoid copyright issues,” Racika clarifies.

The focus of the group is to tell stories in Malayalam, about Kerala. The reason is that there are very few people doing this, unlike other South Indian languages.

Racika says she had been toying with the idea even before lockdown. As had been retired bank employee Geetha Ananth who also wanted to get into storytelling.

“Lockdown came and I could not get into it. Around this time, Racika mooted this idea,” she says. The project served as a platform to hone their skills as well. The group wants to go slow, preferring word-of-mouth publicity and growing organically.

Kadalakkadalas posts two stories weekly, on weekends, of five to eight minutes and sometimes longer depending on the story. “Initially we were uploading a larger number per week. Followers told us they were missing content, so we decided to fix the number at two per week,” says Geetha. The stories are also posted on YouTube on their eponymous channel.

For most of these people this is a first. Except Ninoj, all of them have given it a go. Work commitments kept the IT professional away but he is getting ready with a couple of stories. He has been involved in the technical aspect and came up with the name for the group. Some stories have been subtitled by Anitha, but later stopped as work on the page increased.

Storytelling is not new to Smitha, but filming was new as was narrating them in Malayalam. “My Malayalam is not ‘literary’, it is conversational. I wasn’t sure if it would work; also, I have worked with a live audience in an interactive setting...all this is new to me,” she says. For Anitha this is a first, “Since I have not practised storytelling, ‘telling’ the camera was not difficult as it is not a live session.” The activity has fostered a bond between the members of the group. It has also given Nishi, Sangeetha and Smitha the confidence to use Malayalam more. “I don’t know so many things about Malayalam and Kerala...I am learning more about things,” Nishi says.

Sangeetha adds, “This was a good thing during trying times, I even started writing on my own.”

Each story is built around a theme, first discussed among the core group of seven members and then with a ‘resource’ group comprising scholars and teachers familiar with Malayalam language and literature. The tales are researched to avoid factual errors.

Although group members take turns, they also encourage people from their network to participate. Guest storytellers such as Leena Olappamanna, Swathee Elamon, and Chakiyarkoothu artist Edanadu Rajan Nambiar add to the diversity.

So far, the feedback has been encouraging, the group intends to keep the momentum going.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/1p7b71/article32898342.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpstory1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/a-group-of-storytellers-in-kerala-is-creating-a-community-of-listeners-one-malayalam-story-at-a-time/article32898347.ece
43,2020/10/20,Corona Cyclips documents the 600-km cycle journey of two journalists covering the migrant labour crisis,"The news documentary, Corona Cyclips, unpacks stories from a 600-km cycle journey of two journalists covering the migrant labour crisis during the pandemic

Journalists Dibyaudh Das and Sruthin Lal travelled from Delhi to Lucknow in May to cover the displacement of migrant labourers in Uttar Pradesh. The stories the duo covered in their 600-km cycle journey that lasted 12 days have been released as a three-part documentary series, titled Corona Cyclips.

Sruthin and Dibyaudh hadn’t cycled since their school days. The idea for a 600 km ride, the latter admits, was supposed to stay as an idea. “I thought I’ll just suggest this crazy idea in the newsroom meeting and… that’s it. But Sruthin (associate editor) was also excited about it. He came up with a workable plan. The company approved it.” And, the two journalists were on their way.

The journey, amidst a heatwave and a raging pandemic, was expectedly arduous. “My whole body was sore after the first day,” says Dibyaudh, “But we were live-blogging our journey. We shared stories of people who were in need of help. And, we noticed immediate feedback and a lot of people got help. So, that kept us going.”

The reverse migration of labourers from cities to their hometowns was largely a story of heartbreak. Tens and thousands of them traveled over 100 miles on foot, without food, for days. The Guardian called it “the greatest exodus since partition”. The documentary, apart from capturing this, also covers moments of benevolence. “Throughout our journey, we saw people -- Panchayat workers, officials, Dhaba owners -- providing food and water to labourers. In Vrindavan, for instance, we met some villagers who make tulsi malas for a living. Their livelihoods were hit badly due to the lockdown. But they came together to help the migrant labourers. They pooled in money and food grains and fed the people coming into the state,” says Sruthin.

Sruthin says travelling in cycles helped them get such stories. He calls it ‘slow journalism’, wherein one stops, observes and investigates upon noticing something interesting. His colleague concurs. “A lot of people helped us because we were on cycle. I think they could relate to us. It’s not the same as getting out of an AC car and putting mics in front of them. It was also easy to access some villages that wouldn’t have been possible with bigger vehicles. It saved us from the problem for looking for fuel as well during the lockdown.”

Another concern that was at the back of their heads was the COVID-19 disease itself. “Back in May, the villages were largely uninfected. Since we were travelling from cities and towns, we were doubly careful about not contracting the virus and spreading it in the villages,” says Dibyaudh.

The entire documentary has been filmed using a mobile phone. “We carried a tripod. But it wasn’t needed much,” says Sruthin, “You don’t need a lot of resources to tell a story. That was the biggest takeaway from our journey. All you need is a mobile phone. With social media, you can create an immediate impact as well.”

The labourers’ stories, Sruthin feels, have been forgotten. “The media and the people seem to have moved on from the issue. I hope this documentary’s release serves as a reminder.”

Under the MoU, IITMIC will refer start-ups with proven technology and established cash flows to the bank. The bank, in turn, will extend loans of up to ₹50 crore to these units for their working capital requirements or purchase of machinery and equipment, said a top official at the Chennai-based bank.

“It is a known fact that banks find it difficult to fund start-ups , as they do not meet the requirements under traditional models of financing. This initiative will be the spring board for start ups to realise their ambitions,” said Padmaja Chunduru, MD & CEO, Indian Bank.

“We see this collaboration as a perfect fit both for Indian Bank and IITMIC. We also recently launched “MSME Prerana” programme to empower MSME entrepreneurs through skill development and capacity building workshops in local languages,” she said.

Sterlite Power Ltd. on Tuesday said it had achieved financial closure for its Vapi II North Lakhimpur Transmission Ltd. (VNLTL) project by securing the entire debt funding of ₹2,070 crore from the Power Finance Corporation Ltd. The closure has been achieved within four months of the SPV acquisition of the project, said Sterlite Power, which acquired VNLTL SPV in June.

Sterlite Power had acquired VNLTL SPV in June 2020. to execute one of the largest inter-state transmission system projects covering Western Region Strengthening Scheme-XIX (WRSS-XIX) and North Eastern Region Strengthening Scheme-IX (NERSS-IX).

This single project, with its various sub-elements, will supply clean and green energy from solar, nuclear and hydro power to the western and north eastern region of India.

This project will also set up 179 km of lines for critical system strengthening to decongest the Navi Mumbai transmission corridor by bringing in an inter-state transmission feed of about 1,000 MW.

This link will cater to the energy requirements in the region owing to the upcoming Navi Mumbai Airport and Special Economic Zone (SEZ).

47,2020/10/20,IRDAI mulls standard Cyber Liability insurance cover,"As a step towards such a product, a Working Group has been constituted by the regulator

After conceptualising Standard Health and Life insurance covers, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) is keen on evolving a basic Standard Cyber Liability Insurance product.

As a step towards such a product, a Working Group has been constituted by the regulator. The nine-member group, with Consultant-Liability Insurance P. Umesh as chairman, has been tasked to explore possibility of developing standard coverages, exclusions and optional extensions for various categories.

In doing so, the Group has been advised to study various statutory provisions on information and cyber security; evaluate critical issues involving legal aspects of transactions in cyber space; and to examine various types of incidents involving cyber security in recent past and possible insurance coverage strategies for them.

The terms of reference of the working group, which is required to submit its report within two months, include examining the cyber liability insurance covers available in the country and abroad and recommend scope of such covers for the present context and the medium term too.

An order constituting the working group said amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been rising incidences of cyber attacks and a growing number of high-profile data breaches. It is felt that cybersecurity is the most important need for all sectors today to address the numerous risks posed by cyber-attacks, the regulator said.

Stating that insurance products need to adapt to the changing environment, the IRDAI communication said the General Liability policies do not cover cyber risks. Cyber insurance policies currently available were highly customised for clients in a new and quickly growing market. Thus, it was felt that a basic standard product structure is required to provide insurance cover for individuals and establishments to manage their cyber risks.

The members of the working group include have been drawn from public and private sector insurers, reinsurers, National Insurance Academy and IRDAI officials.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/irdai-mulls-standard-cyber-liability-insurance-cover/article32896454.ece
48,2020/10/20,Brookfield to buy 18% of RMZ’s assets for $2 billion,"Realty firm has debt of ₹12,500 crore

In one of the biggest deals in the real estate sector in the country, Bengaluru-based realty firm RMZ has agreed to sell about 18% of its commercial assets portfolio to global investment firm Brookfield for $2 billion.

“RMZ has decided to divest a part of our core portfolio across Bengaluru and Chennai to raise $2 billion of fresh capital,” RMZ chairman Manoj Menda said in a statement. “Upon divestment, RMZ is now among the only zero debt real estate companies globally,” he asserted.

Mr. Menda added that with this deal, the company now had ample headroom to achieve its next phase of growth. RMZ aims to grow its real asset portfolio to 85 million sq. ft. over the next six years. RMZ, whose debt is estimated at ₹12,500 crore, has sold 12.5 million sq. ft. of its total real estate assets of about 67 million sq. ft. The deal also includes divestment of the group’s co-working business CoWrks.

49,2020/10/20,Hybrid model of ‘smart’ fence being tested along the LoC,"Work is also on to convert the existing border fence into a ‘hybrid’ barrier

The Army has significantly improved its electronic surveillance along the Line of Control (LoC) to check infiltration, and work on converting the existing border fence into a smart fence integrated with several sensors is under way, several officers have said.

However, there is a rethink on converting the entire fence over a 700 km stretch into a smart one due to the high cost. A hybrid model is now being adopted.

“The new hybrid model of the smart fence being tested will cost around ₹10 lakh per km and 60 km is being attempted this year,” a senior officer on the ground said. “This has some rudimentary smartisation. The earlier proposal for a hi-tech fence was to cost around ₹10 crore for 2.4 km. A ₹10 crore type trial was done in the Army’s 19 Division last year, but it was too expensive so no more contracting was done,” the officer said.

The fence will be integrated with LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors, infrared sensors and cameras among others.

In recent months, the Army has beefed up troops close to the LoC to plug gaps and it has resulted in a drop in infiltration this year. Lt. Gen. B.S. Raju, General Officer Commanding, 15 Corps, said that while the multi-tier anti-infiltration grid remains in place, the first tier has been strengthened. Troops have also been given drones, both big and small, to monitor the ground.

The existing fence called the Anti-Infiltration Obstacle System (AIOS) is located about 700 m from the LoC. The double row fence consisting of concertina wire was constructed between 2003 and 2005. With its high rate of degradation every year due to snow, the Army came up with a proposal to install a smart fence with various sensors integrated into it and a pilot project was subsequently taken up.

For instance, Tangdhar sector gets 10-15 feet snowfall in peak winters, which means in some places the entire fence gets buried. Due to snow, the iron fence becomes brittle and consequently 60-70% of the fence has to be repaired every year, a second officer on the ground said. “Every year, there is a major exercise over four months from March to June to bring that fence up,” he said.

The fence is present along most of the around 740 km long LoC. While the damage to the fence is less south of Pirpanjal due to less snow, heavy snowfall in North Kashmir causes big damage, officials said. In addition to the fence, the Army has deployed long range surveillance systems to detect people and small vehicles, both during day and night. The fence too has been integrated with various sensors.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/j43qs9/article32903410.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-LOC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hybrid-model-of-smart-fence-being-tested-along-the-loc/article32903411.ece
50,2020/10/20,Coronavirus | Negligence could lead to reinfection: ICMR,"If a person gets infected again after 90 days, it is called reinfection, says ICMR chief

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday called for sustained caution against COVID-19 and pointed out that any negligence could lead to reinfection.

“COVID-19 reinfection in India is currently under investigation and we are collecting data on this. As per the knowledge that we have now, we understand that after COVID-19 infection, antibodies stay in the body for anywhere between 3-5 months. If the person gets infected again after 90 days, it is called reinfection,” ICMR Director General Dr. Balram Bhargava said.

The government, he noted, was also keenly following the Solidarity trial interim report results, which indicated that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalised patients. “The results are interim, not peer reviewed. Debate and discussion are on and we will take the results of these trials into consideration. Alongside, the benefit of blood plasma for COVID-19 patients is under review and debate,” he said at a Health Ministry press conference.

Monitoring Bihar

Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, giving an overview of the COVID-19 condition in the country, said a Central team would be deputed to overlook and assist the Bihar government in conducting elections while following the COVID-19 norms.

India was one of the countries with high recoveries and it continued to have one of the lowest fatality rates globally. “The country has reported 587 case fatalities in the past 24 hours. Of these, nearly 81 per cent is concentrated in 10 States/Union Territories. The deaths are below 600 for the second consecutive day. Maharashtra reported the maximum single-day deaths (125 deaths),” he said.

The country’s new confirmed cases in the last 24 hours had fallen below 50,000 (46,790) for the first time in nearly three months. The new cases were 47,703 on July 28.

‘No oxygen shortage’

Mr. Bhushan said that in the past 10 months since the pandemic began, “India has not faced any medical oxygen shortage and isn’t anticipating any problem in the future. However, several measures, including importing medical oxygen, have been planned. The MHA [Ministry of Home Affairs] has issued directions to ensure free and 24-hour movement of medical oxygen between States/UTs,and the NPPA [National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority] has fixed the maximum price of liquid medical oxygen at ₹15.22 per cu mt. and oxygen [medicinal gas] in cylinder at ₹25.71 per cu mt.”

To ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen, the Central government would help hospitals in setting up plants within their premises, he said.

The Ministry said six States accounted for 64 per cent of the total active cases in the country — Maharashtra 23.28 per cent, Karnataka 14.19, Kerala 12.40, Tamil Nadu 5.09, AndhraPradesh 4.68, West Bengal 4.62 and the rest 35.75 per cent. The most-affected districts in Maharashtra included Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nagpur and Ahmednagar, while Bengaluru Urban, Mysuru, Tumakuru, Hassan and Dakshina Kannada were the most-affected districts in Karnataka. In Kerala, the districts were Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Thrissur and Thiruvananthapuram.

With a high number of patients recovering every day and the sustained fall in the mortality rate, India’s steady trend of dipping active cases continued. The percentage of active cases had fallen below 10 per cent and the total positive cases of the country today were less than 7.5 lakh (7,48,538) and comprised merely 9.85 per cent of the total cases.

The total recovered cases had crossed 67 lakh (67,33,328) and Maharashtra continued to lead, with more than 15,000 single-day recoveries; followed by Karnataka,with more than 8,000 recoveries. Seventy-five per cent of the new confirmed cases were from 10 States and UTs. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala contributed more than 5,000 to the new confirmed cases, the Ministry added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5bryc9/article32903302.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-TEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-negligence-could-lead-to-reinfection-icmr/article32903303.ece
51,2020/10/20,China opposes India-Taiwan trade ties,"Statement comes ahead of trade talks

China on Tuesday asked India to approach ties with Taiwan “prudently and properly” and said it would “firmly oppose” any official exchanges between New Delhi and Taipei.

Also read: Posters wishing Taiwan taken down after Chinese embassy complaint

The statement from China’s Foreign Ministry came in response to reports that India and Taiwan were considering going forward with talks on a trade deal. India and Taiwan in 2018 already signed a bilateral investment agreement. India-Taiwan trade ties have expanded since and Taiwanese firms are prominent investors in India, although India and Taiwan do not maintain formal diplomatic relations.

“The 'One-China principle’ is a universal consensus of the international community, including India,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing, when asked about the report on trade talks.

“It is also the political basis for China to develop ties with other countries. So, we firmly oppose any official exchanges between countries having diplomatic ties with China and Taiwan or signing any official documents. The Indian side should remain committed to the ‘One-China principle’ and approach Taiwan-related issues prudently and properly,” Mr Zhao said.

Earlier this month, the Chinese Embassy in Delhi raised with India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) the putting up of posters in New Delhi on October 10, wishing Taiwan “Happy National Day”, put up by a member of the BJP, including outside the Chinese Embassy. The posters were taken down following the complaint.

The posters, along with a social media campaign on October 10, followed a note sent by the Chinese Embassy to around 250 journalists asking them not to refer to Taiwan as a “country” or a “nation” while covering an event to be organised by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre (TECC) in India.

Also read: China sends fighters towards Taiwan

The MEA responded to the note, saying “there is a free media in India, that reports on issues that they see fit”.

On Tuesday, China reacted guardedly to India’s announcement that Australia will join next month’s Malabar naval exercise with India, Japan and the United States.

In a terse statement, Mr. Zhao said, “We have taken note of this development. We always believe that military cooperation between countries should be conducive to regional peace and stability.”

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it had lodged a protest with the United States, over a meeting in Washington between Assistant Secretary Robert Destro of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, who has been appointed as a special coordinator for Tibetan issues, with Lobsang Sangay, the head of the “Government-in-Exile” in Dharamsala.

“The appointment of the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues is a political move to interfere in China’s internal affairs and sabotage Xizang’s [Tibet’s] stability,” Mr. Zhao said.

“We have lodged stern representations with the U.S. side. The so-called Tibetan government-in-exile is a separatist political organisation chasing a wild dream of Tibetan independence. It violates China’s Constitution and law and it is not recognised by any nation worldwide. Lobsang Sangay as its head is out and out an anti-China separatist. China firmly opposes him engaging in anti-China separatist activities in whatever status and whatever pretext in any country. We firmly oppose officials of other countries having any kind of contact with him. We urge the U.S. side to stop interfering in China’s internal affairs and sabotaging Xizang’s development and stability, and refrain from offering any support to separatist forces. China will take all measures to safeguard its own interests,” the spokesperson said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/grweac/article32902760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-CHINA-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/china-warns-india-on-ties-with-taiwan/article32902761.ece
52,2020/10/20,"Dussera | Worship silently with family, says Odisha CM Navven Patnaik","Ahead of festive season, Naveen Patnaik urges caution with COVID-19 in televised speech

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday urged people to stay indoors during the Dussera celebration.

“COVID-19 positive cases in Odisha have started to come down during past two weeks. When on September 26, daily spike was above 4,000 cases, today it has dropped below 2,000 [cases a day]. The positivity rate has also fallen and, in future, cases will decline,” said Mr. Patnaik in a televised address on Tuesday.

“Two months back, Ganjam was a hotspot in the State, reporting hundreds of cases every day. The situation in Ganjam and Gajapati district has largely improved due to community participation and the efforts of COVID warriors. These two districts have become inspirations for others,” he said.

“People should not draw self-satisfaction from this. The character profile of coronavirus is very critical. We need to stay alert till the vaccine and drugs for the disease are made available,” said Odisha CM.

“The pandemic had assumed critical proportion in European countries during March and April. Many people had lost their lives. Subsequently, the infection rate came down. Now, the contagion has taken upward movement,” Mr. Patnaik pointed out.

On September 1, daily reporting of cases was above 1,200, and the daily spike again touched 17,000 on October 8. Similarly, France reported daily increase of 3,000 cases on August 31, and the daily spike rose to 26,000 cases on October 10.

Stating that Kerala had managed the pandemic wonderfully, Mr. Patnaik said the rate of infection in the southern State had tripled after the famous Onam festival.

“Experts have predicted that COVID-19 will turn for worse in the winter season. Durga Puja and Deepavali will be celebrated in the near future.

53,2020/10/20,Tea emerges as a new smuggling item to Bangladesh from Tripura,"Tea of some of the plants has attracted an international market

Tea has now emerged as a new item for smuggling to Bangladesh from Tripura. The Border Security Force recently seized 20 quintals tea power at Bilashchara in Kamalpur of Dhalai district.

The seized consignment was handed over to the local police station.

A police officer on Tuesday said smugglers collected the powder from a tea estate. The BSF personnel of the Kathalbari border outpost have foiled the attempt, he said.

The officer said the border in the area has been fenced but desperate smugglers make attempts to throw consignments across and sometimes use ladders for the purpose.

Tripura has some 50 tea gardens and several of them are owned by the State government after they were abandoned by the planters. The tea of some of the plants has attracted an international market at the initiative of the Tripura Tea Development Corporation Limited.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mzco4r/article31241983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tvid-Tea-Plantation,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tea-emerges-as-a-new-smuggling-item-to-bangladesh-from-tripura/article32902501.ece
54,2020/10/20,Govt denies info on Chief Information Commissioner applicants,"SC had directed govt to make such information public

The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has received 139 applications for the post of Chief Information Commissioner, which has been vacant for almost two months. However, it has denied a Right to Information (RTI) request seeking further details about the candidates, the search committee members and the short-listing criteria, despite a Supreme Court order directing the government to make such information public.

The Central Information Commission is the highest appellate authority under the RTI Act, and consists of a chief and up to 10 Commissioners. It has been headless since the last chief retired in August, and has been functioning at half strength, with only five Commissioners, even as its backlog crossed 35,000 cases.

Applications invited in July

In July, the DoPT invited applications for the Chief Information Commissioner post. RTI activist Anjali Bhardwaj subsequently filed a request for information on the number, names and particulars of the applicants. If a search committee had been set up, she asked for the order for its constitution; the names and designations of its members; dates, agenda and minutes of its meetings; the criteria adopted by it for shortlisting candidates; other documents and files regarding the appointment process; and current status of the process.

In its reply, the DoPT said it received 139 applications within the prescribed time. However, it declined to give out any other information, holding that information relating to particulars of applicants is exempted under section 8(1)(j) for RTI Act, 2005, which aims to protect individual privacy unless the larger public interest is involved.

“As the process of selection is yet to be completed, it would not be conducive to furnish such information in the manner it is sought. No such practice is followed in any other equivalent high level appointments of government,” it said.

In its February 2019 order, the Supreme Ccourt directed that to ensure transparency of Information Commissioner appointments, the Central and State governments should put up “all necessary information” on their website, including particulars of the applicants and composition of the selection committee. “It would also be appropriate for the Search Committee to make the criteria for shortlisting the candidates, public, so that it is ensured that shortlisting is done on the basis of objective and rational criteria,” it stated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u90scy/article31475744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-rti-logo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-denies-info-on-chief-information-commissioner-applicants/article32902372.ece
55,2020/10/20,"India must review FCRA, says UNHRC chief Michelle Bachelet","Law too vague, criminalises constructive criticism, says High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) Michelle Bachelet on Tuesday appealed to the Government of India to review the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act and its compliance with international human rights norms, and regretted that it was being “used to deter or punish NGOs for human rights reporting”.

“Constructive criticism is the lifeblood of democracy. Even if the authorities find it uncomfortable, it should never be criminalised or outlawed,” Ms. Bachelet said.

The statement referred to over 1,500 arrests made in relation to protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and for violating the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, as well as those made in the Elgaar Parishad case that includes the most recent arrest of Catholic-priest Stan Swamy, and the closure of Amnesty International after its bank accounts were frozen due to alleged FCRA violations.

“I urge the government to ensure that no one else is detained for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly — and to do its utmost, in law and policy, to protect India’s robust civil society,” the High Commissioner said.

“I also urge the authorities to carefully review the FCRA for its compliance with international human rights standards and to release people charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for simply exercising basic human rights that India is obligated to protect,” the statement added.

The UN Human Rights Committee oversees the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which India is a party. The ICCPR provides for the freedom to form associations and receive funds for these associations. At the heart of the UNHCHR’s criticism on Tuesday of the FCRA is that its “vaguely worded and overbroad” provisions curtail these freedoms.

A detailed note prepared by the Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Peaceful Assembly and of Association, Maina Kiai, accompanied the High Commissioner’s statement. The note says that FCRA violates India’s obligations under ICCPR as its vaguely defined grounds tantamount to a total ban on foreign funding for NGOs and Civil Society Organisations (CSO). It explains that while ICCPR allows restrictions of freedom to association, the “State party must prove the precise nature of the threat”. Further, under the ICCPR, restrictions can be imposed on grounds of protecting national security or public order, but these concerns are seen to be legitimate only when NGOs support terrorist activities or call for violence or the complete rejection of democratic principles.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bt4aev/article32902326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-UN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-must-review-fcra-says-unhcr-chief-michelle-bachelet/article32902328.ece
56,2020/10/20,"Coronavirus still around, PM Modi cautions nation ahead of festival season","The Prime Minister said the government is making all efforts to ensure that a vaccine, whenever it is launched, reaches every Indian.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on Tuesday, October 20, asked citizens not to lower their guard in the fight against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) during the festive season as the virus is still around even though restrictions have been eased.

Mr. Modi, in his seventh address to the citizens on the pandemic, reiterated his earlier slogan, “Jab tak dawai nahi, tab tak dhilai nahin [Don’t lower your guard until a vaccine is found],” to stress the point that a “little carelessness can spell grief for the people”.

At one point, the Prime Minister appealed to the citizens with folded hands to wear masks, sanitise their hands and maintain social distance as he wanted to see them happy.

Role of media

He also appealed to the media and social media platforms to create public awareness among citizens about the need to be careful.

“Until a vaccine against this pandemic is found, we should never allow the fight against corona to weaken… We should not forget that even if the lockdown is gone, the virus has not. With the effort of every Indian for the past seven-eight months, the situation today is stable. We should improve upon it and not allow it to deteriorate,” Mr. Modi said.

“This is not the time to get careless or believe that corona is gone or that there is no threat from it. In recent days, we have seen many pictures and videos where people are either lax or have stopped being careful. This is not right at all. If you are careless and moving around without mask, you are putting yourself, children and the elderly at risk,” the Prime Minister added.

Mr. Modi said that the whole world was working on a war footing to find a vaccine. A few vaccines were at an advanced stage of trial in India. He said his government was working on a plan “to deliver it to every Indian within the shortest possible time” once these vaccines were ready.

Comparing India’s situation with other countries such as the U.S, Brazil, Spain and Britain, the Prime Minister underlined the country’s “success” in saving lives.

He said while there are nearly 25,000 COVID-19 cases for one million population in countries such as the U.S. and Brazil, India has only 5,500. Similarly, the number of fatalities in India is 83 per million population against more than 600 deaths per million in nations like the U.S., Brazil, Spain and Britain.

Mr. Modi also said India now has more than 90 lakh beds for COVID-19 patients, 12,000 quarantine centres, 2,000 labs for testing and, soon, the total numbers of tests will cross 10 crore. “The rate of testing has been one of our strengths,” he added.

Mr. Modi wrapped up his 12-minute speech by wishing citizens for the upcoming festivals including Navratri, Durga Puja, Diwali, Chhath, Eid-Milad-un-Nabi and Guru Nanak’s birth anniversary.

Congress' reaction

Reacting to the Prime Minister's address, the Congress said that Mr Modi must answer for the ""failure of leadership"".

In a joint statement, Congress' Randeep Surjewala and Pawan Khera said India had become the ""corona capital"" with the highest death rate.

57,2020/10/20,Wildlife Institute of India scientists anxious after Finance Ministry recommends funding cut,"Review of 194 autonomous bodies across 18 Ministries says 109 bodies must be merged into 26, and government must ‘disengage’ from 23

A recommendation by the Finance Ministry to divest the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) of its status as an autonomous body of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has triggered anxiety among scientists at the organisation.

A letter by the WII Director to the Environment Ministry says that the directive was “unviable” and would affect the institution’s ability to be seen as an “unbiased opinion generator” that both government and public sector units consulted for assessing the impact of development projects on wildlife.

The institute has an annual expenditure of ₹34 crore that was sourced from the Environment Ministry. It generated only ₹3.5 crore from consultancy and advisory services, which went towards paying pensions to employees appointed before 2004.

“The major responsibility of this Institute is to provide advice to MoEFCC based on scientific information on policy and management of the country’s Wildlife Resources. This role can only be performed and remains relevant as long as the institute remains a part of the MoEFCC,” says the letter signed by institute Director, Dhananjai Mohan. The Hindu has viewed this letter.

A scientist with the institution, who declined to be identified, said that the proposal if implemented would be “the death knell” of the organisation that has 112 employees.

The Finance Ministry moves follows a review by its Expenditure Department of 194 autonomous bodies across 18 Ministries. Of them, 109 bodies must be merged into 26, and government must “disengage” from 23, one which is the WII.

In the case of WII, the government will cut funding to the institute by 25% every year, and it could become a ‘Deemed University’ engaged in teaching and research. The Central government could continue to access WII advisory and training services as a “client.” Dr. Mohan’s letter, however, said that there were too few students and courses offered by the institute for it to qualify as a Deemed University, and it had twice been rebuffed by the University Grants Commission on these grounds.

Along with the WII, other autonomous bodies that have been recommended to be disengaged are the Indian Institute of Forest Management, and the Indian Plywood Industries Research and Training Institute. Other Environment Ministry organisations, such as the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History will be subsumed within the activities of the Environment Ministry. Still others, such as the Society of Integrated Coastal Management and the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management, will be merged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/dtog8/article31958124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-FINANCE-MINISTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/wii-scientists-anxious-after-finance-ministry-recommends-funding-cut/article32902101.ece
58,2020/10/20,Uttarakhand HC notice to Maharashtra Governor on contempt plea,"Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has till date not paid the market rent to for a government bungalow allocated to him as a former CM, the petition said

The Uttarakhand High Court on October 20 sought Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s stand on a plea for starting a contempt proceeding against him for his failure to follow a court order to pay market rent for a government bungalow allocated to him as a former Chief Minister.

Justice Sharad Kumar issued notice to Mr. Koshyari through his counsel after hearing arguments of the petitioner’s counsel on maintainability of the contempt plea.

The plea filed by a Dehradun-based NGO, Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra, accuses the former Chief Minister of committing “willful non-compliance” of the court’s May 3, 2019 order which had asked him to pay market rent of the bungalow occupied by him as ex-CM within six months of the direction.

Mr. Koshyari has till date not paid the market rent to the government as calculated against him, the petition said.

The respondent has also not paid the amount due upon him towards amenities such as electricity, water, petrol, oil etc., it said.

“We have fulfilled the requirement provided under Article 361(4) of the Constitution of India and already given 60 days’ notice to Koshyari before filing the contempt petition,” petitioner’s counsel Kartikeya Hari Gupta said.

The petition also accuses the State government of favouring the respondent unlawfully and arbitrarily by passing the Uttarakhand Former Chief Minister Facilities (Residential and other Facilities) Ordinance 2019, and later enacting a law with the same name to ease him out of his payment obligations.

The law was found to violate the separation of powers doctrine and Article 14 of the Constitution, the petition said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/d8amdz/article32901217.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BHAGATSINGHKOSHYARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttarakhand-hc-notice-to-maharashtra-governor-on-contempt-plea/article32901218.ece

Union Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday launched an online portal that provides information about CSIR ushered repurposed drugs and their current stage of trials.

The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has been exploring multiple combination clinical trials of antivirals with host-directed therapies for a potential treatment of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.

It has been working with the AYUSH Ministry for clinical trials of AYUSH drugs and has undertaken safety and efficacy trials of prophylactics and therapeutics based on individual plant-based compounds.

Apart from information about CSIR repurposed drugs, the website -- CuRED -- also provides details about clinical trials of diagnostics and devices in which the scientific body is involved.

Five clinical trials, involving Withania somnifera, Tinospora cordifolia plus Piper longum (in combination), Glycyrrhiza glabra, Tinospora cordifolia and Adhatoda vasica (individually and in combination) and AYUSH-64 formulation are undergoing safety and efficacy trials, according to an official release.

A key clinical trial by CSIR is that of Sepsivac (Mw) against COVID-19 in partnership with Cadila. The phase-two clinical trial of this drug has been completed successfully on critically ill COVID-19 patients and a more extensive phase-three trial is on the anvil, the scientific body said.

Also, the phase-two trial of phytopharmaceutical AQCH on COVID-19 patients with Sun Pharma and DBT is underway.

In addition to clinical trials of repurposed drugs and vaccines, CSIR has been involved in clinical trials of diagnostics and devices.

Vardhan lauded the efforts of CSIR for being at the forefront of the ongoing fight against COVID-19 and prioritising clinical trials, generating data for their regulatory approval and helping the launch of drugs and diagnostics in the market.

He commended the approach of using repurposed drugs, synthesising COVID-19 drugs through new processes and transferring it to the industry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbfptc/article32796941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08HARSHVARDHANNEWS3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vardhan-launches-website-for-info-on-clinical-trial-of-csir-ushered-repurposed-drugs/article32900893.ece
61,2020/10/20,Students can now seek provisional admission to CA foundation course after class 10: ICAI,"The new norms will enable students to become a Chartered Accountant (CA) six months before the present timeline

Students will now be able to seek provisional admission to foundation course of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) after class 10 exams, according to new norms.

However, provisional admission to the foundation course will only be regularised once a candidate clears class 12 exams.

The new norms will enable students to become a Chartered Accountant (CA) six months before the present timeline.

“The institute has recently got the approval of the government for amending the regulations 25E, 25F & 28F of Chartered Accountants Regulations, 1988, which now enables candidate to provisionally register in the Foundation Course of ICAI after passing Class 10 examinations. However, provisional admission to the foundation course will only be regularised once the candidate clears class 12 exams,” said Atul Kumar Gupta, President, ICAI.

The basic objective behind the proposal was to allow students to provisionally register in the foundation course after passing class 10 examination, he said.

“This will help students to prepare for the foundation course while pursuing class 11 and 12 and thus students would have ample time to update their knowledge and acquire requisite techniques to appear and pass CA foundation with flying colours. The ICAI also offers free online classes to students of the foundation which can be accessed anytime, anywhere,” Mr. Gupta added.

After appearing for class 12 examination in February or March, students would then be eligible to take the foundation examination to be held in May or June.

Detailing the advantages of new entry requirements, Mr. Gupta said, “Students can provisionally register themselves for the CA Foundation course after passing class 10 examination hence providing them with more time for developing, understanding and preparing for the professional course”.

“Students will be able to complete four months study period while pursuing class 11 and 12 and appear in foundation examination in the month of May or June immediately after appearing in class 12 examination. With the new norms, students will be able complete CA course and become Chartered Accountant, six months in advance, due to early admission,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vzptlh/article31944156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-ICAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/students-can-now-seek-provisional-admission-to-ca-foundation-course-after-class-10-icai/article32900212.ece

Active cases of COVID-19 in India are less than 10 % of the total caseload, while the number of people who have recuperated from the disease has crossed 67 lakh pushing the national recovery rate to 88.63 %, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday.

There are 7,48,538 active cases of coronavirus infection as on date which comprise 9.85 % of the total caseload.

“The slide in active cases is supplemented by an exponential rise in recoveries,” the Ministry said.

“India is the only country with the highest recoveries and continues to have one of the lowest fatality rates globally. Today it stands at 1.52 %,” the Ministry highlighted.

“These have in tandem resulted in consistent slide in the active cases,” it added.

This is the result of collaborative, focussed and effective action by states and UTs under the Centre’s strategy of comprehensive and high countrywide testing, prompt and effective surveillance and tracking, quick hospitalisation and effective adherence of the Standard Treatment Protocol issued by the Centre, it said.

This success is a result of selfless service and dedication of doctors, paramedics, frontline workers and all other COVID-19 warriors across the country, the Ministry said.

The number of new coronavirus infections reported in a span of 24 hours in India dropped below 50,000 for the first time in nearly three months, the Ministry said. The new cases were 47,703 on July 28.

The Ministry said 75 % of the new infections are from 10 States and UTs. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala contribute more than 5,000 to the new confirmed cases.

Also, 78 % of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 States and UTs .

Maharashtra continues to lead with more than 15,000 single day recoveries followed by Karnataka with more than 8,000 recoveries.

The Ministry said 587 case fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours.

Of these, nearly 81 % are concentrated in ten States and UTs. The deaths are below 600 for the second consecutive day.

Maharashtra has reported the maximum single day deaths (125 deaths).

India’s COVID-19 caseload mounted to 75,97,063 with 46,790 new infections being reported in a day, while death toll climbed to 1,15,197 with 587 fatalities being registered in a span of 24 hours, the data updated at 8 a.m. showed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k0jesn/article32885797.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/health-ministry-highlights-slide-in-active-covid-19-cases-in-india/article32898911.ece
63,2020/10/20,Govt. hikes poll expenditure ceiling by 10%,"The hike in expenditure limit will help candidates contesting Bihar assembly poll as well as bypolls to one Lok Sabha and 59 assembly seats.

The Law Ministry has increased the ceiling on poll expenditure for Assembly and Lok Sabha elections by 10%. The move follows a recommendation by the Election Commission in view of curbs imposed during the coronavirus [COVID-19] pandemic.

The notification, issued late on Monday evening, will help candidates contesting the Bihar Assembly polls as well as those fighting bypolls to 59 Assembly seats across 11 States and one Lok Sabha seat.

The ceiling on poll expenditure varies across States, with candidates in Assembly elections in bigger States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu now allowed to spend up to ₹30.8 lakhs as against ₹28 lakhs earlier.

For a candidate contesting a Lok Sabha poll in these States, the revised ceiling on poll expenditure is now ₹77 lakhs instead of the earlier amount of ₹70 lakhs.

Goa, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and a few Union Territories, based on the size of their constituencies and population, have a lower ceiling on poll expenditure. Here while the enhanced ceiling for a Lok Sabha candidate is now ₹59.4 lakhs those contesting an Assembly can spend up to ₹22 lakhs.

The last time the expenditure ceiling was enhanced was in 2014 just ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.

Over a month ago, the EC had recommended a 10% increase in expenditure for all elections to be held during the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping in mind the problems that candidates may face while campaigning under the various COVID protocol laid down by the poll panel.

The notification that amended the Conduct of Elections Rules, however, does not mention that the limit has been increased in the wake of the pandemic or if it is only for the COVID-19 period.

“The amended rules shall come into force on the date of their publication in the official Gazette and shall remain in force till such date as may be notified by the Central Government,” read the Gazette notification.

While the three-phase Assembly polls in Bihar will be held on October 28, November 3 and November 7, bypolls to Assembly seats in most other States will be held on November 3.

Union Minister of State for Home G.K. Reddy, who is touring Ladakh's Leh district, warned Pakistan and China on Monday against “interfering in India's internal affairs,” as he announced a slew of development projects for the region.

Janata Dal (U) Bihar unit president, Bashishtha Narayan Singh, stressed that the Assembly election is a straight fight between two major alliances, with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar having the clear advantage of being a recognised leader with a track record administration and reform.

China’s economic growth continued to gain momentum in the third quarter, with the GDP expanding 4.9% from a year earlier in the July-September period, according to official Chinese data released on Monday.

With just over a fortnight to go until Election Day, U.S. President Donald Trump and his opponent Democratic nominee Joe Biden continued to woo voters in ‘battleground states’. However, the commonalities mostly stopped there – the two candidates delivered sharply contrasting messages on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. economy and questions of policing and racial justice.

The Army said as per established protocols, he will be returned to Chinese officials at the Chushul–Moldo meeting point after completion of formalities.

“China hopes that India will hand over soon the Chinese soldier who got lost in China-India border areas on the evening of October 18 when helping local herdsmen retrieve a yak at their request,” Senior Colonel Zhang Shuili, spokesperson for the PLA’s Western Theater Command, said in a statement.

The PLA, in its statement, said “the PLA border troops informed the Indian military right after the incident and hoped the Indian side would aid in search and rescue, and the Indian side promised to offer help and return the missing soldier timely after finding him.”

“The latest information from the Indian side is that the lost Chinese soldier has been found and will be handed over to the Chinese side after receiving medical examination,” the statement said. “We hope that the Indian side will live up to its promise to hand over the missing Chinese soldier as soon as possible and implement the consensus reached by the two sides in the 7th round of Senior Commanders meeting, so as to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.”

Following the seventh round of talks on October 12, both sides said in a joint press release they had “a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the Line of Actual Control in the Western Sector of India-China border areas.”

“They were of the view that these discussions were positive, constructive and had enhanced understanding of each other’s positions,” the release said. “Both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement as early as possible. Both sides agreed to earnestly implement the important understandings reached by the leaders of the two countries, not to turn differences into disputes, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in the border areas.”

At the previous sixth round in September, both sides said they agreed to not add to the already heavy build-up on both sides of the LAC. However, both sides have not, as yet, reached an agreement to thin the presence and move towards disengagement, and a return to the status quo prior to China’s multiple transgressions in the Ladakh sector starting in May.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/594zjh/article32897581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MosReddy2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/china-claims-soldier-who-crossed-lac-was-helping-local-herdsmen/article32897642.ece
66,2020/10/20,CBI books fresh case against PNB scam accused official,"Shetty allegedly received over ₹1.08 crore to facilitate LoUs in favour of fugitive Mehul Choksi’s Geetanjali Group of companies

The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a fresh case against Gokulnath Shetty, a former Punjab National Bank (PNB) Deputy Manager, for allegedly receiving over ₹1.08 crore to facilitate Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) in favour of fugitive Mehul Choksi’s Geetanjali Group of companies.

The agency had earlier booked Mr. Shetty for his alleged role in the ₹13,578-crore PNB scam involving diamond merchant Nirav Modi, his uncle Mr. Choksi, their companies and associates.

Mr. Shetty, who has since retired, was then posted at the Brady House Branch of the bank in Mumbai. It is alleged that he conspired with Debjyoti Dutta, the owner of Rishika Financials, during 2014-17 to get bribes for sending LoUs through the bank’s system to foreign funding bank.

In lieu of the alleged favour, Mr. Dutta had given him blank cheques of various bank accounts held in his name and that of his wife, other relatives and staff. The cheques were later filled in by Mr. Shetty in his own handwriting and money withdrawn in various names, alleges the CBI.

The FIR states that Mr. Dutta was in the business of arranging quotes for LoUs from various foreign funding banks. After getting confirmation from him, Mr. Shetty would send them. He used to raise bills to the account of Geetanjali Group maintained with the PNB towards his service charges of getting the quote from the foreign funding bank.

Mr. Shetty used to send the bills to the group companies and on their instruction, transfer the money from their account to those of Rishika Financials in the PNB and Axis Bank, it is alleged.

Mr. Dutta charged 0.05% of the LoU amounts as brokerage from the borrower companies located in India and would share 40% of the amount with the accused bank manager, according to the agency.

In the previous cases, Mr. Nirav Modi and Mr. Choksi are facing extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom and Antigua, respectively.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u2cgyc/article32873337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-stock-cbi-investigation,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-books-fresh-case-against-pnb-scam-accused-official/article32896328.ece
67,2020/10/20,PM to attend 50th anniversary of Bangladesh independence,"Modi to visit Dhaka in March 2021 for 50th anniversary celebrations

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Dhaka to participate in the celebration of 50th Independence Day of Bangladesh on March 26, 2021, Bangladesh’s Foreign Minister Dr. A.K. Abdul Momen has said. Dr Momen said the occasion will be marked by celebrations on both sides.

“We invited the Indian Prime Minister to visit Bangladesh on March 26 next year. It was accepted. We would love to see Indian PM Modi join our 50th anniversary of independence celebrations. Our victory means India’s victory as well. India will also celebrate our anniversary of independence,” said Dr. Momen interacting with journalists after meeting Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka Vikram Doraiswamy.

Mr. Modi was scheduled to visit Dhaka to participate in the Mujib centenary celebrations in March this year but the programme was cancelled by the government of Bangladesh in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both sides had planned a series of activities for the “Mujib year” that were affected by the global health crisis. However, the plans for the 50th anniversary celebrations remain on track as of now.

Both the Prime Ministers of India and Bangladesh will meet for a virtual summit coinciding with the celebrations of victory of the 1971 war in December. The two sides are expected to discuss a number of issues like water sharing, infrastructure projects and cooperation to defeat the pandemic during the summit.

Bangladesh celebrates December 16 when the 1971 India-Pakistan war came to an end with the defeat of Pakistan Army but the country marks March 26 as the official Independence Day as it was on this day in 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced the birth of Bangladesh in a dramatic speech. Pakistan Army had launched a severe campaign after this announcement which culminated in the war and liberation of the country.

68,2020/10/20,Plea filed in SC on long existence of six vacancies including CIC,"Apex court on December 16 told govt. to fill up all the posts in three months, it says

An urgent application has been filed in the Supreme Court about the long existence of six vacancies, including that for the Chief Information Commissioner in the apex Right to Information body — the Central Information Commission — even as the backlog of cases has mounted to over 36,600.

Activist Anjali Bhardwaj, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, said the six vacancies of Information Commissioner, including that of the Chief, despite an order of the Supreme Court way back on December 16 last year to the government to fill up all the posts in three months.

Ms. Bhardwaj said the post of the Chief Information Commissioner has been vacant since August 27, 2020.

The vacancies frustrate the legislative intent of the Right to Information Act, means to usher in transparency in governance and choke the right of the ordinary people to information.

“As of October 15, 2020, the number of pending appeals/complaints is more than 36,600. It appears the Union of India is resorting to issuing fresh advertisements instead of filling all the advertised vacant posts to cause undue delay in the appointments thereby frustrating peoples’ right to information,” the application contended.

It said the situation on the State Information Commissions is none the better. The Maharashtra Information Commission is functioning with only five commissioners with a backlog of nearly 60,000 appeals and complaints as on July 31, 2020. Its Odisha counterpart is functioning with four commissioners despite a pendency of 15,000 appeals and complaints.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6yjh4z/article32883893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/plea-filed-in-sc-on-long-existence-of-six-vacancies-including-cic/article32896587.ece
69,2020/10/20,"10,000 sex workers decry effort to deny them rights","Open letter criticises prominent anti-trafficking activist

Nearly 10,000 sex workers have written an open letter condemning an appeal from a prominent anti human trafficking activist, Sunitha Krishnan, to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to withdraw its advisory to the Union government that sex workers be treated on par with informal workers.

On October 7, the NHRC issued a “human rights advisory” on protection of women’s rights in the context of COVID-19 following an impact assessment done by a Committee of Experts. It recommended that State governments must provide assistance and COVID-19 relief to sex workers; recognise their vulnerability to domestic violence and ensure their protection; and ensure free testing and treatment for COVID-19. But the most important and landmark suggestion was on recognising sex work as work and including women who perform it as informal workers.

But days following the advisory, Sunitha Krishnan, founder of the NGO Prajwala, wrote to the NHRC calling its advisory on sex workers an “aberration”, that there was “no concept of sex work”, and that recognising it as such would be tantamount to “human rights violation” and legitimising sexual exploitation. This letter sparked widespread outrage among sex workers’ collectives, academics, gender rights activists, lawyers and public health experts.

On Monday, the total number of signatories to the open letter crossed 11,000, and more endorsements were pouring in. These included 1,000 gender rights activists and over 250 NGOs such as the Forum Against Oppression of Women, ANANDI, National Alliance for People’s Movement, Naz Foundation, and Lawyers’ Collective. They criticised Prajwala’s letter for “its myopic and moralistic objection” to the rights of vulnerable communities such as sex workers.

Their letter states, “By denying the fact that these women are citizens and workers, instead reducing them merely to victims of sexual violence the [Prajwala’s] letter divests them of basic rights and entitlements that fundamentally acknowledge that they are even human...and ignores the voices of millions of adult women who independently sustain themselves and their families through sex work.” It adds that Prajwala makes the oft repeated mistake of conflating voluntary adult sex work with sexual exploitation.

Aarthi Pai, lawyer and executive director, Sangram Sanstha, explains the import of the NHRC advisory according the status of informal workers to sex workers and says, “The understanding of sex workers as informal sector workers is a move forward not just for the immediate pandemic but also the medium to long-term benefit that they will get. Immediately, this makes sense because there is a call from informal workers for some sort of compensation package in light of unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several State governments have been looking at this. There is an important SC judgment that says that even if sex workers don’t have documentation, they must get ration, which is extremely helpful. But their recognition as out-of-work workers and their right to unemployment benefits moves the discussion to the next level, where you are looking at their demands through the rubric of worker’s rights.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/10000-sex-workers-decry-effort-to-deny-them-rights/article32896575.ece
70,2020/10/20,"Nadda raking up CAA issue for political gain, says Sailajanath","‘Its enforcement will trigger unrest in country’

APCC president S. Sailajanath on Tuesday criticised BJP national president J.P. Nadda’s statement on the Centre’s plan to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Sailajanath, referring to the reported statement of Mr. Nadda in Siliguri on Monday, said despite protests across the country, it was unfortunate that the Centre was gearing itself up to implement the “draconian law.”

He alleged that the BJP and the RSS were eyeing political gains in view of the impending elections in Bihar and West Bengal.

‘YSRCP double standards’

“The ruling YSRCP in the State had extended its support to the passage of the Act in Parliament. But when the minorities in the State protested against it, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy adopted a resolution in the Assembly against the CAA. This is nothing but an eyewash,” Mr. Sailajanath said.

“There is a need to expose the double standards of the YSRCP government on the issue,” he added.

Stating that implementation of the CAA would trigger unrest in the country, Mr. Sailajanath said it was ridiculous to ask people who were born here to prove their citizenship.

Stating that CAA implementation would polarise people on the basis of community and religion, he said certain regional parties such as the YSRCP and the TDP were trying to add fuel to the fire to further their selfish motives.

Mr. Nadda had raised the issue of separate Gorkha land in West Bengal only to mount pressure on the Mamata Banerjee government, he alleged, and added that the States would once again witness people’s movements against the discriminatory law.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/nadda-raking-up-caa-issue-for-political-gain-says-sailajanath/article32903929.ece
71,2020/10/20,Jagan and Naidu backing BJP’s anti-people policies: Sailajanath,"He launches a signature campaign against the three farm Acts

APCC president S. Sailajanath on Tuesday faulted the ruling YSRCP and the Opposition TDP for competing with each other in extending their support to the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.

Leading the signature campaign against the three farm Acts, Dr. Sailajanath said that while the Chief Ministers of several States opposed the legislations, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu backed the BJP’s “'anti-people policies.”

Calling upon people to actively take part in the signature campaign, he said it was the Congress party that had introduced the Minimum Support Price and reached out to the farmers as and when the prices of farm produce fell below the MSP in the open market.

Leaving the farmers at the mercy of market forces would lead to more farmer suicides, he feared, and said that the country’s economy was in a shambles after the BJP came to power at the Centre because of its “corporate-friendly” policies.

Meters opposed

Dr. Sailajanath further said that the Congress party was against the YSRCP government’s decision to fix meters to farm pump-sets at the behest of the Centre as it was a step towards ending the free power scheme over a period of time.

E. Babu Rao of Parvathipuram in Vizianagaram district developed a drum seeder which not only improves productivity in sowing twenty different crops, but also increases yield by 70%. The seed sowing process is brought down from a whopping 20 days to less than an hour.

The cocoon harvester designed by Gurumurthy Chetty of Gangavaram is a path-breaking de-weeding equipment in sericulture. Sainath Reddy of Gadwal offers custom-made organic fertilisers depending on the crop. S. Lakshmi of Kurnool brings hydroponic solutions at one’s doorstep to grow healthy greens and vegetables. B. Sarala Kumari has gone a step further to develop chopped curries that get cooked once dropped in boiling water. Chandrasekhar of Thottambedu developed a plant juice to kill weeds.

Hanumappa of Ananthapuram has brought out a groundnut harvester that can also bring the agro-waste to use. Vijaya Bhaskar and B. Vijaya Gowri Devi, both from Tirupati, are into millet processing to make cakes and eatables.

Nurtured at Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University’s (ANGRAU) Agri Innovations and Entrepreneurship Cell and ‘Poshan’ incubator, these are some of the innovative brains that found solutions to many of the vexatious problems plaguing the farm sector.

The union government has provided financial grant to these farmers and entrepreneurs to kick-start their operations. The cheques were formally handed over by the varsity’s board member T.

Mr.Muralinatha Reddy said the refreshingly-new ideas would be incubated and developed as a ‘marketable product’ at the centre and invited farmers and farm students to come up with proposals. As agriculture gets market-driven, Dr.Giridhara Krishna saw the need for the fraternity of researchers to meet the aspirations of farmers, for which he called documentation of old practices and gauging the transformation as the first step.

78,2020/10/20,Nellore stands first in disease control in A.P.: Collector,"‘Caseload has come down from 25,000 to 2,458, thanks to efforts of health workers’

From the 13th position in Andhra Pradesh, Nellore district has emerged first in the State in checking the spread of coronavirus as fresh cases as also fatalities declined while more persons recovered from illness.

This was made possible thanks to the multi-pronged strategy adopted by the district administration, focusing on aggressive testing, roping in of private hospitals in COVID-19 treatment in a big way, and plasma therapy, said District Collector K.V.N.Chakradhar Babu.

The case load in the district, which had been in the order of over 25,000 at one point of time had come down to a mere 2,458 in the last 24 hours thanks to continuous efforts of the health professionals in coordination with revenue, police and other departments concerned, he said, happy over the district administration’s strategy paying dividends.

As many as 57,352 of the 59,810 persons have so far recovered from the illness and returned home. With many of them volunteering to donate plasma, 900 units were collected and precious lives saved in the district.

The district was at the forefront in the State in providing plasma therapy, he said and attributed the spurt in cases to proximity to Chennai and influx of migrants to port-based industries in the district. Returnees from Koyambedu market had caused the spread of the disease initially.

84,2020/10/20,TTD urged to resume free darshan at Tirumala,"Virus does not spread through this stream alone: Tirumala Tirupati samrakshana samithi

Members of the Tirumala Tirupati Samrakshana Samithi (TTSS) staged a demonstration in front of the administrative building of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) here on Monday, demanding resumption of free darshan at the temple of Lord Venkateswara.

While all forms of darshan were suspended in view of the increasing cases of coronavirus in March early this year, devotees were allowed entry into the temples in graded manner once the measures announced earlier were relaxed. “But with an eye on revenue, the TTD has resumed everything but free darshan,” charged TTSS joint secretary R. Viswanath, who spearheaded the demonstration.

Mocking the argument that opening the free darshan stream could lead to further spread of the infection, the agitators wondered how the virus could spread by allowing the free darshan, mostly availed by common people, alone. “The nation has witnessed how the virus has attacked all strata of the society, right from the common man to the Vice-President of India,” he added.

The demonstrators also questioned the rationale behind the TTD management in reportedly sending invitations to leading politicians and industrialists, urging them to take part in the Navaratri Brahmotsavams, while denying entry to the common man on the pretext that it was being performed in Ekantam (in private). The agitators relented after a senior security official assured them to take their plea to the TTD Executive Officer and get free darshan introduced within four days.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ue4jd1/article32896389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJTIRUPATI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ttd-urged-to-resume-free-darshan-at-tirumala/article32896390.ece
85,2020/10/20,Tie-up with Amul to boost farmers’ economy,"It will lessen their dependence on agents, provide remunerative prices

The seven-day visit of dairy sector experts from Amul Cooperative Society in Gujarat, from October 12 to 18, has galvanized the hopes of the dairy farmers of Chittoor, Kadapa and Anantapur districts.

As part of the tie-up between the AP Dairy Development Cooperative Federation Limited and the Amul Dairy, the team had visited a number villages in the three districts, besides interacting with dairy farmers and studying the patterns of production and marketing.

Deputy Director (APDDCFL) G.K. Srinivasa told The Hindu that after bifurcation of A.P., the State had lost the access to better marketing facilities. Over a period of five years, though the milk production remained healthy, its marketing continued to cause a worry. “This has clearly rendered a big chunk of the dairy industry unorganized, giving scope to agent system. The tie-up with Amul is expected to boost dairy farmers’ economy by providing them remunerative prices, besides showing them a way to avail government support such as loans and other logistics such as guidelines to feed and veterinary care for the animals,” he said.

Forming societies

Chittoor district, with its daily milk production of 35-40 lakh litres, tops in the State. While 60% of the production is supplied to the private dairies through agents, the remaining stocks are disposed of through local sales and vending. The prime idea of the Amul experts’ visit is to form the societies at the village and mandal levels to benefit the dairy farmers and to check exploitation. Though this visit was only a preliminary exercise, more and more modalities would be chalked out in near future.

Private dairies

The farmers had brought to the notice of the Amul team that in the absence of cooperative societies in Chittoor district, they were forced to approach the agents for immediate payments. They observed that they were clueless as to which dairy they would be supplying their milk to. Since the closure of Chittoor dairy in 2002, followed by Madanapalle dairy later, the farmers were forced to utterly depend on the private dairies.

A senior member of the Amul dairy team said that during their interaction the farmers, they were informed that a farmer is getting ₹22-25 per litre depending on the fat and SNF grades. In some cases, some farmers had to sell milk at still cheaper rates due to low grades. “The tie-up will work in the direction of encouraging the dairy farmers to form into societies and develop their economy by following certain guidelines which are now in force among farmers of Amul dairies elsewhere. We have also studied the possibility of providing incentives to the farmers as had been promised by the State government,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mazeuh/article32896339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJCHAMUL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tie-up-with-amul-to-boost-farmers-economy/article32896340.ece

The King George Hospital (KGH) and Andhra Medical College (AMC) have successfully completed the trial of 2-Deoxy- D-Glucose, a drug developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to treat coronavirus patients with moderate to severe symptoms as an adjunct therapy.

The drug have been administered to nine volunteers, in compliance with the protocols set up by the DRDO and the report has been sent to it for further evaluation.

“The drug was developed as an adjunct therapy to reduce the impact of coronavirus and to hasten the recovery process. As per the DRDO’s specifications, the drug was sucessfully administered to the volunteers. There has been no reactions or side effects till date. The report have been sent to the DRDO,” P.V. Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College and the District COVID Special Officer told The Hindu.

Vaccine trial

Meanwhile, the trials for the COVISHIELD vaccine is on and it has been administered to 40 volunteers so far. COVISHIELD has been developed by the Oxford University, with Serum India Limited and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) as partners.

This vaccine will be administered to 100 volunteers. The KGH and the AMC intend to complete the trials in a week’s time. “The vaccine has been administered to 40 volunteers in the last 10 days. We intend to speed and complete the process by the next week,” said Dr. Sudhakar, adding that there has been no reports of reactions or side effects.

Protocols

Prior to administering the vaccine, the volunteers need go through a detail physical and medical examination. They undergo the RTPCR and antibodies tests to check if they are COVID-19 positive or have contracted the infection in the past.

The volunteers undergo a series of tests up to six months, starting from the third week after they are administered the vaccine. Tests are done to check the level of development of antibodies in the volunteers and to find out if the vaccine has the stimulating properties to develop antibodies that is required to fight the virus, explained Dr. Sudhakar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dude5j/article32896439.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20ONG4KGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-drug-trial-completed-at-kgh/article32896440.ece
88,2020/10/20,IPL betting gangs make a killing from super overs on Sunday,"‘More than ₹50 lakh was placed on bets from Visakhapatnam city alone’

The Indian Premier League (IPL) has been the bumper time any way for those betting money on cricket matches. But, the last Sunday was turned out to be a field day for the punters as both the IPL matches played between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and Mumbai Indians (MI) and Kings XI Punjab were decided in the super overs.

As per a conservative estimate, more than ₹50 lakh was placed on bets from the city alone. This year, the IPL series began behind schedule in the wake of coronavirus pandemic, and the matches are being played without audience in the UAE, as per the WHO protocol. Yet, this appears to have failed to demoralise punters, as betting is on the rise with every finishing game and the law enforcement agencies are not able to lay their hands on them.

According to sources, betting this IPL season is estimated to be more than that of the previous years. “But, it has become difficult to nail the betting organisers as the entire process being done online,” said a senior police officer. Unlike the previous years, betting gangs hailing from other cities appear to have not recruited franchises to set up their base in Visakhaaptnam. It is learnt that betting is being done in online mode from cellphones and that is why the police are unable to nail them, he explained. The police officers, especially those from the City Task Force (CTF), have been conducting raids and nabbing the members of betting franchise who ran their show from apartments in posh localities. But so far, no such cases have been reported this year.

“Things are a little different this time. Punters are directly indulging in betting with the bigger gangs in other cities online and it is being done individually. Bets are being placed online and payment is being done using various apps. A number of punters are also hooked through chat apps and indulging in groups betting,” said an officer who was earlier posted with the CTF.

Bars, where IPL matches are being screened, have become the dens for the betting organisers of late, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/egnlku/article32896415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20ONG4BETTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ipl-betting-gangs-make-a-killing-from-super-overs-on-sunday/article32896420.ece
89,2020/10/20,Boundary extension of Coringa eco-sensitive zone proposed,"The MoEFCC approved the draft in January

All the stakeholders including wildlife and territorial wings of the Forest Department on Monday proposed to extend the boundary of the Eco-Sensitive Zone (ECZ) of the Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary (CWS) up to 500 meters, towards the Hope Island from the water front on the north-east side and 50 meters on the landward side.

Mangrove cover

In January this year, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has approved the ECZ draft which proposed the boundary sanctuary as the boundary of the eco-sensitive zone on the landward side and Hope Island front.

However, the MoEF has asked the stakeholders to revise the ESZ, extending the zone from Zero boundary to some possible extension citing that landward front consists of mangrove cover and that can be protected by bringing it in the limits of the ESZ.

The stakeholders led by East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy on Monday proposed the respective changes to the boundary of the ESZ, without having any adverse impact on the Kakinada Municipal Corporation (KMC) activities on the land front of the sanctuary.

Mr. Muralidhar Reddy also asked the stakeholders to prepare a revised ESZ report which would be submit to the MoEFCC for approval.

Dig at Lokesh

Stating that there was no truth in the allegation of TDP leader N. Lokesh that an input subsidy of only ₹25 lakh was provided, the Minister said that ₹125 crore input subsidy was released in July and August, and Rythu Bharosa was paid to the full in May.

He said Mr. Lokesh was claiming that 64 people were killed in floods in East Godavari and 700 farmers had committed suicide in the State.

Reiterating that there should not be any scope for corruption in mining and supply of sand, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the officials to maintain transparency in sand supply and ensure that the prices are reasonable.

In a review meeting on the new sand policy at his camp office near here on Monday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the government was not giving any scope for corruption and was also following the environmental protection norms. He stated that illegal mining was curtailed and quality sand was being supplied at affordable prices.

‘Set up more reaches’

For better execution of the sand policy, he advised the authorities to increase the number of sand reaches and their capacity along with improving efficiency in supply.

“Building up the capacity can attract large companies, or even Central government institutions,” he said.

Observing that the cost of transportation of sand was a little high, the Chief Minister told the officials to bring it down to a reasonable level.

Also, the price fixation should be at the constituency level, and if anyone was found selling the mineral at prices higher than those stipulated, the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) should interfere and take action, he said.

Challan system

To bridge the demand-supply gap, the Chief Minister instructed the officials to introduce a challan system, where anyone could transport sand by paying challan.

For the construction of government projects, or housing for the poor, sand should be supplied at a subsidised price through a token system, he added.

“Residents of every constituency can avail themselves of the subsidised sand through the token system for construction of houses,” the Chief Minister said.

He had committed such offences in the past at Hanuman Junction, Nuzvid and also at Hyderabad. He was arrested and released on bail about two months ago.

According to Mr. Suresh Babu, the accused first befriends the lorry drivers or owners at highway dhabas (eateries) and gains their confidence, by asking a lift.

102,2020/10/20,"Issue specific rules for disposal of used masks, HC tells State","The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to come out with specific guidelines for disposal of used masks by citizens by November 3, and give wide publicity to the guidelines in print, electronic and social media to create public awareness.

Also, the court directed the government to give proper training to pourakarmikas on collection and handling of personal protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and toiletries used in households, including those having COVID-19 positive patients.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar issued the direction after it was pointed out that the State government has not made citizens aware of the guidelines issued in July by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for handling, treatment, and disposal of waste generated during treatment/diagnosis/quarantine of COVID-19 patients.

The Bench was hearing a PIL petition on issues related to COVID-19 health management. The Bench agreed with the contention of one of the petitioners, K.B. Vijayakumar, that the State government has not made aware of the guidelines on disposal of masks used by citizens as both the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the State governments have merely issued circulars in August and September, respectively, for following the elaborative guidelines issued by the CPCB.

Waste masks and gloves in households, including those used by non-COVID-19 patients, should be kept in paper bag for a minimum of 72 hours prior to disposal of the same as dry general solid waste after cutting the same to prevent reuse, says the CPCB guidelines.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/issue-specific-rules-for-disposal-of-used-masks-hc-tells-state/article32903927.ece
103,2020/10/20,Tumakuru farmer arrested for sending threat letter to city magistrate,"He implicated his brother-in-law to take over his wife and sister-in-law’s property

It was a farmer from Tiptur in Tumakuru district who allegedly sent a threatening letter and detonator-like substance to a magistrate of the Special NDPS court and city court on Monday, warning that he would carry out attacks if the accused in the high-profile drug racket case were not released.

Less than a day after the package was sent, the Halasurugate police on Tuesday arrested 53-year-old Rajashekhar who reportedly orchestrated the hoax in an attempt to implicate his brother-in-law.

According to the police, Rajashekhar who was married to a woman from Tumakuru was also eyeing his wife’s sister so that he could take over her share of the family’s property. The two sisters jointly owned 15 acres of land. “He confessed that he wanted his wife’s sister, and decided to get her husband, Ramesh, out of the picture by having him arrested. He also feuded with Ramesh’s brother,” said a senior police officer.

Rajashekhar started harassing his sister-in-law before she got married, following which her father filed a sexual harassment case with the local police who arrested him. “The sister-in-law later married Ramesh, but the accused continued to harass the family,” the police officer added.

Rajashekhar decided to implicate Ramesh and his brother in a criminal case, but failed repeatedly. “When the Central Crime Branch police arrested actors and other high profile people in the drug racket case, he hit upon the idea of sending a threatening letter with their identity cards,” said the police.

Rajashekhar allegedly bribed village panchayat officials in Chelur where Ramesh lived and paid them ₹300 to get copies of voter ID cards of Ramesh and his brother. He then wrote the letter and posted it along with the voter ID photocopies.

The police formed a special team which went to Chelur and detained Ramesh for questioning. “However, after questioning him, we realised that Ramesh had nothing to do with the threatening letter,” said Assistant Commissioner of Police Najma Farooqi, who headed the team.

The police learned of the family feud and Rajashekhar’s previous attempts to have the brothers arrested. The police team went to Tiptur and caught Rajashekhar in the nick of time while he was planning to escape.

Ongoing investigations have revealed that Rajashekhar was involved in other several criminal cases and had been arrested by the police earlier, not just for sexually harassing his sister-in-law but also for setting fire to a church over a property dispute, stealing copper wire and beating up a waterman in Tiptur.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xkg1m2/article32903905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGCOURTP5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tumakuru-farmer-arrested-for-sending-threat-letter-to-city-magistrate/article32903910.ece
104,2020/10/20,BJP’s role will be crucial in Southern States: C.T. Ravi,"‘Union govt. under Modi has ruled as per people’s aspirations’

National General Secretary of the BJP and former Minister C.T. Ravi has said that the BJP would be a force to reckon with in the general Assembly elections in the States of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry and that it would play a crucial role in government formation.

Addressing presspersons in Hubballi on Tuesday, Mr. Ravi said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Union government has taken several development initiatives and has ruled according to the aspirations of the people.

He said that an era of change has begun under Mr. Narendra Modi and there was no space for separatism in the country now, including Kashmir. “Under Modiji there is no scope for corruption and the Opposition did not have any valid reason to oppose the government,” he said.

Mr. Ravi said that because of reforms, the people of the country have been supporting the party in all recent elections. And, in the Karnataka bypolls too, the people would support the party as amid the COVID-19 situation and the floods, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa was working relentlessly to help the affected people and meet their aspirations. The election results would provide answers to political questions, he said.

The former Minister admitted that because of the COVID-19 situation, the economy of the State was not that good and consequently, funds were not being released to constituencies as per the expectations of the MLAs. However, amid the challenges, development activities were being carried out on priority, he said.

Mr. Ravi clarified that the State government was doing everything for flood relief and as relief had been released from the centre as per NDRF guidelines, there was no dearth of funds for flood relief works. District-in-charge Ministers were monitoring the relief operations to mitigate the sufferings of the displaced people, he said.

No discussion

To a query on reports in a section of the media about former Ministers M.B. Patil and Vinay Kulkarni joining the BJP, Mr. Ravi clarified that no such discussion had taken place in the party. And, even if there was any such issue, a decision would be taken on their inclusion only after consulting the local party units, he said.

Regarding grants for house construction, he said that ₹ 5 lakh was being given for reconstruction of houses that have collapsed. However, in several places, no progress report on construction of houses has been received and this would be brought to the notice of the Chief Minister.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ar5s7k/article32903495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BRAVI2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bjps-role-will-be-crucial-in-southern-states-ct-ravi/article32903496.ece
105,2020/10/20,Belagavi sees significant political developmentsas parties prepare to fight DCC Bank polls,"Preparations by various parties for the elections to the District Central Co-operative Bank in Belagavi have led to significant political developments.

The State Cooperative Election Authority has announced that the filing of nomination papers, and voting, if necessary, will be held on November 6.

The 16-member financial institution mostly had BJP leaders heading it in the recent years.

Current president of the DCC Bank Ramesh Katti, younger brother of the former Minister Umesh Katti has been occupying office for 17 years, while his political rival and Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi has served as cooperative president for five years.

In 2015, Mr. Ramesh Katti defeated Mr. Savadi by a single vote when he polled nine votes against Mr. Savadi's eight.

It was suspected that the lone government nominee favoured Mr. Ramesh Katti. That the two belonged to the same party did not seem to matter.

This time around, Mr. Savadi has two interesting allies — the Jolle couple from Nippani and the Sangh Parivar.

MP from Chikkodi Anna Saheb Jolle has been a long-standing director of the bank. His wife and Minister for Women and Child Welfare Shashikala Jolle is a national-level office-bearer of the Sangh Parivar-affiliate Sahakara Bharati, a federation of co-operative societies.

Senior RSS functionaries held a meeting with DCC Bank aspirants in the house of RSS leader Arvind Rao Deshpande in Athani twice this month.

District in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi exposed cracks in the party when he said that he would abide by the decisions taken by his brother and BJP MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi and Mr. Umesh Katti in relation to issues involving the bank. Another meeting is scheduled on Wednesday.

It was interpreted as if he would not side with the Savadi and Jolle group.

Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi is said to enjoy the confidence of all his brothers, including Congress leader Satish Jarkiholi.

In the Congress camp, Channaraj Hattiholi, brother of MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar, seems anxious to contest.

The MLA, however, has denied it.

DCC Bank polls have gathered interest as local politics in Belagavi tends to have repercussions at the State level.

Two years earlier, the choice of candidates for the Belagavi Taluk Rural Development Bank led to a bitter battle between Ms. Lakshmi Hebbalkar and the Jarkiholi brothers that shook State politics.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/belagavi-sees-significant-political-developmentsas-parties-prepare-to-fight-dcc-bank-polls/article32903487.ece
106,2020/10/20,The boys who have made Bidar proud,"Mohammad Arbaaz Ahmed was in eighth standard when his father suffered a paralytic stroke. He remembers his brothers carrying their father Mohammad Saleemoddin to hospitals in Basava Kalyan and Bidar. Doctors said that it may be a result of an accident or injury in the past. They began a series of treatments, but little came of it.

He lost his job and was barely mobile. His wife started working as a house help to keep the hearth warm. Saleemoddin was a lorry driver handling goods vehicles between Mumbai and Hyderabad. He worked overtime to feed his large family and send his children to school.

But the illness affected the family badly.

This, however, did not deter the children from succeeding in school. His eldest son got into an engineering college, another got into medicine and the third became a dentist.

Arbaaz, who has obtained the 85th rank in the NEET all India rankings and the third rank in the State, says that his brothers who succeed in the face of adversity, inspired him. “My parents also supported me. Four years ago my father suffered a stroke and became bed-ridden for months. But he never asked me to quit studying or take up a job. He nudged me to keep studying so that I could become a doctor and help a lot of people,” Arbaaz told The Hindu.

He says he is likely to be accepted into the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. The studious youth, however, does not want to stop at MBBS. “I want to complete my post-graduation and then, take up research to create low- cost treatment for the poor,’’ he said.

Arbaaz scored 97 % in PU and 92 % in SSLC exams. He joined the Bidar-based Shaheen PU College. The college admitted Arbaaz free, just as it had admitted his two brothers.

“This year, we have admitted 300 students free, against our intake of 1500,” said Abdul Quadeer, secretary of Shaheen PU College that has produced NEET toppers Karthik Reddy and Arbaaz.

Karthik Reddy’s father Rama Reddy is a professor of mechanical engineering in Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College in Bidar.

His mother Kalpana is a government primary school teacher. “My elder brother is an engineer. He is a student of M.Tech. But I was not sure of what to do after PU. I got interested in medicine after discussing with my friends at the college,’’ he said.

He was a day boarder who chose a semi residential model which meant he went to college at 7 in the morning only to return home at 9 p.m.. He says that he spent the lockdown period solving past question papers. The college staff came home to give the papers and collect the answer sheets every day. “We kept in touch with our teachers via phone and video conference calls,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xyxiej/article32903479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGBIDARNEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/the-boys-who-have-made-bidar-proud/article32903480.ece
107,2020/10/20,Southwest monsoon is not over yet: IMD,"The usual period for the all-important Southwest monsoon is considered to be from June to September-end

Wet weather is likely to continue in the State as the Southwest monsoon, which was to end on September 30, has continued well into October. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that the Southwest monsoon is yet to withdraw from southern India, which means that most parts of the State will continue to receive rain.

Last year too, the State had witnessed a prolonged monsoon season into October. The usual period for the all-important Southwest monsoon is considered to be from June to September-end.

IMD, Bengaluru’s C.S. Patil told The Hindu that the system was still favourable for monsoon and it was yet to withdraw from the southern States. “Last year too, we saw the monsoon continue till October. This system has to make way for the Northeast monsoon to set in, which could be around October 30, plus or minus seven days,” he said.

The KSNDMC rainfall forecast till Wednesday has predicted fairly widespread to widespread light to moderate rains with isolated heavy to very heavy rains over north interior Karnataka, south interior Karnataka, coastal Karnataka and Malnad regions, while widespread light to moderate rains with heavy rains over isolated places has been forecast in BBMP areas over the next two days.

Heavy rains have been causing mayhem in many parts of north Karnataka while coastal Karnataka saw massive flooding in mid-September. The State on the whole has received 27% excess rainfall this monsoon till September 30, compared to 23% excess last year.

As against the normal 840.7 mm, the State received 1,063.9 mm rainfall during the period. No district had deficient rainfall this time.

While only seven districts had normal rainfall (+19% to -19%), parts of north interior Karnataka and south interior Karnataka saw a huge departure from normal with many receiving excess rainfall (anywhere from 20% to 59%) and large excess (over 60%).",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/i6ia9d/article32903246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGMONSOONRAINP5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/southwest-monsoon-is-not-over-yet-imd/article32903247.ece
108,2020/10/20,KASSIA calls for implementation of 25% procurement policy,"Industry body says the move will be a substantive stimulus for MSMEs

Small industries apex body KASSIA on Monday demanded the strict implementation of government notification on procurement from MSMEs.

In a statement released on Monday, K.B. Arasappa, president, KASSIA, demanded implementation of the notification on 25% of the procurement by government departments and undertakings under the MSMED Act.

There are glaring examples of the same being flouted with impunity on one pretext or the other. On the other hand, if properly executed, the move will be a substantive stimulus for MSMEs, he said.

Mr. Arasappa, said, “There is a need for increased spending on infrastructure, housing for the weaker sections and public works, and health in order to kickstart growth, which will automatically generate demand for products and employment, which in turn will generate consumer spending creating a virtuous cycle for the economy.”

But, he said, MSMEs in the State are staring at an uncertain future as they are unable to come out of the shocks inflicted by the pandemic and its continuing spread even after six months, with no respite in sight in the near future.

Listing out the steps needed to help the sector, he said banks must advance loans to industry borrowers as mandated without creating hurdles so that the schemes may have the desired impact during a difficult time for the industry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kassia-calls-for-implementation-of-25-procurement-policy/article32902663.ece

115,2020/10/20,"Tourist footfall low due to pandemic, scaled-down Dasara","The usual sight of sea of humanity at Chamundi Hills, palace, zoo is missing this time

Halfway through Dasara, places of tourist interest in the city including Chamundi Hills, palace and zoo are wearing a deserted look and the revival of the sector is a long haul ahead.

Though the city roads tend to be choked with traffic at night, it is mainly due to local people driving in their private vehicles to witness the illumination of the streets. The tourist spots are barely getting any visitors.

In normal times, Chamundeshwari temple atop the Chamundi Hills is a must-visit during Navaratri not only for the thousands of tourists but also for the local people. The rush would be such that it would take anywhere between 2 hour to 3 hours for a fleeting darshan of Goddess Chamundeshwari. But the pandemic has kept the visitors away.

Shashishekar Dixit, chief priest of the temple, told The Hindu that the past four days since the commencement of Dasara has seen limited footfall. “We have not received more than 1,500 to 2,000 devotees and tourists per day since the commencement of Dasara. In the earlier years, the crowd would be unmanageable requiring a special queue which too would be highly patronised.’’ But the footfall is higher than what it was during July when the Muzrai temples were opened after the lockdown, he added.

The situation is similar at the Mysuru palace which used to received anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 tourists per day during Dasara every year. But since October 1, the footfall has hovered below 1,000 visitors on most days. It crossed the 2,000 mark only on four occasions this month so far. On Monday, there were 752 visitors. The Mysuru zoo – which is otherwise closed for visitors on Tuesdays but kept open on October 20 in anticipation of tourists – received less than 500 people.

The hospitality sector too is not faring any better. “There are nearly 2,000 registered taxis in Mysuru catering to tourists and they tend to be booked in advance during Dasara. But only 20 per cent of them are plying due to poor demand’’, said Prashanth of Mysore Travels Association.

Narayana Gowda, representing the hospitality sector, said there was nearly 25 per cent bookings but the occupancy rate in properties outside the city limits was less than 15 per cent. This is the lowest occupancy rate ever for Mysuru, he added ,

The peak tourism season would commence with Dasara and peak from the second half of October every year. But tourism revival is not a priority for a majority of people grappling with challenges of managing with reduced income and insecurity over jobs. For now, remaining safe till the pandemic subsides is the priority.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tourist-footfall-low-due-to-pandemic-scaled-down-dasara/article32901702.ece

120,2020/10/20,Communist leader Maruti Manpade passes away,"Senior Communist leader Maruti Manpade, 65, died at a private hospital in Solapur, Maharashtra, on Tuesday. He is survived by a wife and two sons.

Mr. Manpade was, for the last two weeks, suffering from COVID-19 and recently shifted from ESIC Hospital in Kalaburagi to a private hospital in Solapur. As per the family members, his last rites would be held at his native village Leganti in Kamalapur taluk, Kalaburagi district.

Mr. Manpade was widely known for his uncompromised struggles against the exploitation and oppression of toiling masses in the State for the last three decades. He was a leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and entrusted with the responsibility of organising the farmers and agricultural labourers in the State. Leading mass struggles from the front, Mr. Manpade was, along with others, assaulted several times by the police and put behind bars.

Even during the COVID-19 lockdown, Mr. Manpade was not at rest. He would gather some activists and stage demonstrations, maintaining social distance, to bring forth the sorrows and suffering of the people. He was always on the move across the State, especially in northern districts, organising the masses and leading people’s agitations.

Mr. Manpade was also known for his straightforward words and approach in dealing with the people’s issues – be it local or global. He had an in-depth knowledge of national and international issues that impacted the common people on the ground. He had mastered the art of studying complex issues in their comprehensiveness gathering maximum data and elucidating them in a simple language to make the common people understand.

Based in Kalaburagi for a long time, Mr. Manpade was more concerned about the growers of red-gram, black-gram and green-gram – the crops that were extensively grown in the district. He often criticised the Union government’s irrational import policies that, he had felt, was the direct and major reason for the sufferings of the growers. He had strongly opposed the duty-free import of pulses in large quantities from the big players, especially the Adani Group, which had, he held, caused the fall of prices of domestically grown pulses. He had been demanding at least 30% duty on the imports of pulses. His demand was, however, never considered.

Mr. Manpade had also tried his luck in electoral politics by contesting once for Bidar Lok Sabha constituency as a candidate of JD(S) and CPI(M) coalition and thrice for Kamalapur and Gulbarga Rural constituencies, but could not make any difference.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/snvahz/article32899451.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20201020MarutiManpade2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/communist-leader-maruti-manpade-passes-away/article32899452.ece

BJP MLA in Vijayapura Basanagouda Patil Yatnal on Tuesday said Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa “will not be CM for long. Even the high command is tired of him.”

He also said the next CM would be from North Karnataka.

“Mr Yediyurappa will not be CM for long. He is neglecting North Karnataka completely. He is taking all the money and development to Shivamogga. Even former minister Umesh Katti has noticed that. He has also said he is the CM for Shivamogga. Senior leaders are tired of the CM,’’ Mr Yatnal said during the launch of construction works at a Hanuman temple in the city.

According to Mr. Yatnal, the next CM will be a leader from north Karnataka. “Every time the BJP comes to power, north Karnataka districts elect 100 MLAs. But the CM is chosen from south Karnataka districts that send only around 15 MLAs to the assembly. How can this continue? I know that for sure. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given this assurance,’’ he said.

“I have fought with Mr. Yediyurappa over the cancellation of the special grant of Rs 125 croresfor the Vijayapura city corporation. I appealed to him to restore it, but he did not.

125,2020/10/20,Cannot deny services for not installing Aarogya Setu app: HC,"The Centre has said that no public authority can refuse any service for not having the app

The High Court of Karnataka on Monday clarified that the government or its agencies cannot deny any service or benefit to citizens for not installing the Aarogya Setu app on their mobile phones in the absence of any legislation.

It may be noted that the Union government has said that no public authority can refuse any service for not having Aarogya Setu app in the wake of National Executive Committee set up under the Disaster Management Act not making the use of app mandatory.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi made this observation while hearing a PIL, filed by Anrivar A, Aravind, a city-based software engineer working for a non-profit organisation to protect people’s rights in the digital space.

When Senior Counsel Colin Gonsalves insisted that HC should direct the governments not to deny any service for not installing the app as the Centre has not yet submitted its response in writing to the petition, Union Ggvernment Standing Counsel M.N. Kumar clarified to the court that no public authority or agency can make use of the app mandatory for any service contrary to the order passed by the NEC, which has said that use of app is only voluntary. Mr. Kumar also clarified that no authorities have denied any service to citizens for not having the app. Further hearing was adjourned till November 10.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gm2x3x/article32896576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGAAROGYASETUAPP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cannot-deny-services-for-not-installing-aarogya-setu-app-hc/article32896577.ece
126,2020/10/20,No construction at Kapalabetta without our permission: HC,"Harobele Kapalabetta Abhivrudhi Trust had planned to install a 114-ft. statue of Jesus

The High Court of Karnataka on Monday restrained Harobele Kapalabetta Abhivrudhi Trust from carrying out any construction without express permission from the court on 10-acre government gomal land granted to it at survey number 283 of Nallahalli village in Kanakapura taluk of Ramanagaram district where the trust proposes to install a 114-ft. statue of Jesus.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed interim order on a PIL petition filed by Anthony Swamy, a resident of Harobele village and seven others.

The petitioners have stated that they are “pained by by the illegal grant of a valuable government land for the petty, selfish, and electoral gains of two politicians, by blatant misuse of power for grabbing valuable land and putting up illegal constructions, causing immense damage to government gomal land, loss to exchequer, and causing communal harmony.”

Pointing out that population of Christian community in Kanakapura is only 2,000 of the total population of 7.5 lakh, of these 2,000 Christians, around 1,500 are residing in Harobele and Nallahalli villages, the petitioners said that idea of erecting a statue of Jesus was purely of ‘two brothers – D.K. Shivakumar and D.K. Suresh – for their selfish political gain and to create a vote bank for their party rather than promoting the Christian community’.

There is no demand or formal request by Christian community for the land or for a statue, the petitioner said while pointing out that there already was a church at the place to serve the local Christians.

Further pointing out that trust came into functioning only in June 2016, the petitioners said that process of allotment of land for the trust was, in fact, initiated by Mr. Shivakumar, who was Minister then, and Mr. Suresh, who is a MP, by writing separate but similar letters to Ramanagaram DC in February 2018 to allot 15 acres of this land for the trust.

“The trust was floated at their [two brothers] behest and the trustees are their front men, their staunch followers, and political party workers in the garb of devout Christians,” the petitioner alleged, while pointing out from the records secured through RTI that the trust had filed a formal application only in March 2018.

The petitioners have also contended that the land grant was contrary to several provisions of the Karnataka Land Grant Rules as well as the 2011 parameters prescribed by the Supreme Court for grant of government lands.

The petitioners have said that the land was finally granted to the trust on December 4, 2019, and the trust made the request to Nallahalli panchayat on the same day to call an emergency meeting the next day to grant building licence. Though the panchayat granted licence for house, several construction works were begun sans permission.

Also, the petitioners have said that the land is either under the Cauvery Wild Life Sanctuary’s eco-sensitive zone or abutting the zone.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/o0bbmv/article32896421.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGKAPALABETTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/no-construction-at-kapalabetta-without-our-permission-hc/article32896422.ece

Steps were also being taken to release compensation for crop loss and pending instalments of grants for house construction, he said.

After visiting Gurjapur Bridge-cum-Barrage on Monday, Mr. Savadi, who is also district in-charge of Raichur, said that there is a difference of opinion among residents on shifting the village to the higher place.

“Residents in villages, including Gurjapur, Arasinagi, D. Dongarapur, Atkur and Burdipad, are facing problems every time there is floods,” he said and asked officials to find a solution.

Officials of the Agriculture, Horticulture and Revenue departments have been directed to conduct a joint survey to assess the loss owing to floods, the Deputy Chief Minister said and added that compensation will be distributed based on the assessment report. Getting information from officials about rehabilitation centres already established, he said that the lack of basic needs in such centres had forced people not to shift to the centres.

131,2020/10/20,How knowledge of forensic science will help a law student,"Various law colleges and science schools have have introduced forensics as a specialisation.

Law is an extremely proactive and competitive field that tests your smartness. Even if you have pursued a Bachelor’s in Law from a top law school, deciding on the next step can be challenging. Most people opt for conventional career options such as criminology, corporate or civil law. However, not many are aware that the forensic sector holds great opportunities.

A combination of Science and Law might sound unusual, but it is one of the finest combinations. Forensic science is a systematic application of scientific principles towards the investigation of crime and collection of evidence. The latter could include traces of papers, objects, dirt and mud, blood, saliva, fingerprints, and much more. Forensic science uses a combination of physics, chemistry, and biology to identify and arrest the criminal, and present the evidence in court.

Diversified knowledge

The number of crimes, cyber and otherwise, has increased over time and criminals have also become cleverer in hiding themselves. Therefore, a legal aspirant needs to have diversified knowledge related to law, sciences, and business.

Having recognised this need, various law colleges and science schools have have introduced forensics as a specialisation. The field has further specialisations such as DNA forensics, trace/fingerprint evidence, ballistics, autopsy techniques, toxicology, modern computers/ clay facial construction, and more. Law students, with forensics as a specialisation, need to understand criminal psychology to solve cases. Therefore, law schools train students to conduct psychological assessments such as polygraph tests, brain electrical oscillation signature profile (BEOSP), narcoanalysis, which were not part of legal studies, earlier.

Since forensics science involves the scientific analysis of evidence, it plays a vital role in the justice systems of many nations. So, it is a desirable career path for law students who want a career that will give them a professional edge.

132,2020/10/20,Reawakening maritime legacy,"Alappuzha port museum being set up by renovating old port office, godowns

The Alappuzha port museum being set up as part of the Alappuzha heritage project is nearing completion.

It will showcase the State’s rich maritime history, especially the story of the Alappuzha port, including its formation, growth as a commercial hub of the erstwhile State of Travancore, and the decline towards the fag end of the 20th century.

The museum is set up by renovating the old port office and godowns attached to it near the Alappuzha beach. “Alappuzha port will not make a comeback. But through the museum, we can relive the glory days. The renovation of the buildings will be completed in two months and the museum will be opened to the public in February 2021,” says Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac.

According to P.M. Noushad, managing director, Muziris Spice Route Heritage Project, the museum will have details of all ancient ports that existed in the State. Artefacts from countries that had trade links with the State through the ancient ports and materials collected from the port sites will be exhibited.

Besides, miniature models of important ships that had called at the Alappuzha port along with models of boats and other materials used will be displayed at the museum. The functioning of the Alappuzha port and experiences of its workers will be recreated with the help of photographs and videos. Those visiting the museum can have an interactive experience — with the help of augmented reality — travelling with Thomas Norton, a missionary who sailed from Plymouth in England to the State in 1816.

A real ship will be installed on the seashore. “The Indian Navy has promised to provide a ship. We hope the ship will reach Kochi by next month. From there, it will be brought to Alappuzha. The last time a ship came to Alappuzha port was in 1989,” Dr. Isaac says.

₹5.6-crore project

By displaying documents and photogrpahs, the museum will be a treasure trove of information about the State’s maritime history, ports, personalities, and so on.

The museum is getting ready under the guidance of Benny Kuriakose, a conservation architect, at a cost of ₹5.6 crore.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will launch various works of the museum, including materials to be displayed, designing, and electrification, on November 3.

134,2020/10/20,Green shoots of hope as caseload tapers,"6,591 new cases from 53,901 samples

It might be early days yet to rejoice, but if the data being released by the Health Department are reliable, Kerala’s COVID-19 case graph is indeed showing a downward trend with cases evidently declining in many districts.

However, the declining trend is not likely to be permanent and the case graph could spike again every time an exogenous factor – like school reopening, Sabarimala pilgrimage or local body elections – has the play, public health experts have cautioned.

On Tuesday, the State registered 6,591 new cases, when 53,901 samples were tested in the past 24 hours, taking the cumulative case burden to 3,53,472 cases.

The number of recoveries reported on the day, exceeded the number of new cases, with 7,375 patients leaving hospitals. The test positivity rate went down from 13.7% to 12.2 %.

The total number of recoveries till date has been 2,60,243. The number of active cases or patients currently undergoing treatment in hospitals is 91,922. Of these, 768 are critically ill and being treated in ICUs, with 193 patients on ventilator support.

Though a week ago, it did look like the State’s active cases were inching towards the three lakh mark, the number of recoveries have been on the high side all of last week, balancing out the increase in new cases.

The Health Department added 24 deaths to its official list of COVID deaths on Tuesday, taking the cumulative death toll to 1,206.

Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, and Malappuram reported five deaths each, Kannur four, two each in Ernakulam and Alappuzha and one at Pathanamthitta.

Of the new cases, 6,486 cases (98.4%) are locally acquired infections, with the source of infection remaining unknown in 707 cases. The number of healthcare workers who contracted the infection is 62.

Among districts, Thiruvananthapuram, which had been reporting the highest number of cases consistently for the past several months, has now fallen to the eight place.

Thrissur reported the highest number of cases on Tuesday at 896, Kozhikode 806, Malappuram 786, Ernakulam 644, Alappuzha 592, Kollam 569, Kottayam 473, Thiruvananthapuram 470, Palakkad 403, Kannur 400, Pathanamthitta 248, Kasaragod 145, Wayanad 87, and Idukki 72.

135,2020/10/20,Achuthanandan turns 97,"Chairman of the Administrative Reforms Commission and veteran Communist leader V.S. Achuthanandan turned 97 on Tuesday.

Mr. Achuthanandan is convalescing at his official residence here after doctors treated him for a minor cerebral haemorrhage in 2019. He has shunned public programmes and avoided visitors since. His 97th birthday was a quiet affair compared to past years. He spent it with his family and close aides.

Governor Arif Mohammad Khan conveyed his greetings to Mr Achuthanandan via Twitter. CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran also gave his best wishes and described his association with Mr. Achuthanandan in warm terms.

Mr. Achuthanandan was born in a family of agricultural workers in Alappuzha on October 21, 1923. He had participated in the Punnapra-Vayalar uprising against the colonial government.

136,2020/10/20,Harsh Vardhan’s remarks on State unfortunate: Rahul,"‘Weaker sections need more support to tackle pandemic’

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said the recent remarks of Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan about the rising COVID-19 cases in Kerala are unfortunate.

Speaking to media after attending a meeting of the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee and a review meeting of the district administration on the COVID-19 situation in Wayanad district on Tuesday, Mr. Gandhi said the collective response of the people of Kerala had contributed to containing the pandemic.

When the State witnessed a spurt in infections, Mr. Vardhan said the State was “paying the price for gross negligence” during Onam festivities when unlocking of services along with an increase in travel for trade and tourism led to the spread of COVID-19.

Though the district had fared well in tackling the pandemic, weaker sections, including the tribespeople, needed more support, Mr. Gandhi said.

Coming down heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr.Gandhi said though close to 12,000 sq km of the country was invaded by China, the Prime Minister was lying about the fact. “I would like to know from PM Modi when the Chinese will leave our country. I don’t think there is any country in the world that will be silent like this,” Mr. Gandhi said. “I would like PM Modi to speak on this, but I guarantee you he won’t use the word China,” Mr. Gandhi added.

Criticising his party leader Kamal Nath’s remarks about Bharatiya Janata Party leader Imarti Devi, Mr. Gandhi said it was unfortunate. “Kamal Nathji is from my party, but personally, I don’t like the type of language he used. I don’t appreciate it, regardless of who he is. It is unfortunate,” Mr. Gandhi said.

Regarding a query on the approach of the Enforcement Directorate (ED ) to former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, Mr. Gandhi said the BJP was using national agencies such as the ED and the CBI for its political motives. The three-day visit of Mr. Gandhi in his constituency will conclude on Wednesday. He will live for Delhi at 3.20 p.m. after visiting the District Hospital at Mananthavady.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hyyq70/article32903788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvwy2rahul,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/harsh-vardhans-remarks-on-state-unfortunate-rahul/article32903783.ece

The dates have not been finalised. But it has been decided to schedule the elections so as to enable the local body governing councils to assume office on December 11, State Election Commissioner V. Bhaskaran said.

Seven districts each will go to polls in the two phases of the elections.

Earlier, an all-party meeting had decided to put off the elections by one month in view of the spike in COVID-19 cases. The arrangements for the elections are in progress, Mr. Bhaskaran said. The draw of lots for the allocation of reservation wards has been completed.

138,2020/10/20,"Come to Munnar, stay on KSRTC bus","Two old deluxe buses to serve as economy class living rooms

An accommodation on a Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus will soon be possible, if a project for giving economy class living rooms to tourists is realised in Munnar.

Two old deluxe buses with 16 berths have reached the Munnar KSRTC depot for the purpose. “It is hoped that the project will be realised by November when the tourism season starts,” says depot in-charge Sevi George.

The buses have facilities to serve food and 16 berths are arranged similar to that on trains. It is most suited to group and family travellers. The daily rent has been fixed at ₹1,600.

Only one group will be allowed on a bus. Though the maximum capacity is 16 persons, a small family can also use the accommodation. The bus will be parked in an open space near the depot providing an ideal view from the room, says Mr. George adding that there will be electricity connection and water heater inside the bus. Two bathrooms have been made exclusively at the depot for the use of those accommodated on the buses. “Food will not be served inside the bus. However, tourists can purchase and have it inside the bus,” he says.

KSRTC sources say by November the tourist flow to Munnar is expected to pick up and the facility will be ready then. The KSRTC is expecting a favourable response from tourists as accommodation facilities will be costly at the hill station during the peak season.

Moreover, proximity to the town and readymade accommodation near the depot will make it attractive to travellers reaching Munnar. The accommodation can be booked in the depot phone number.

The diversification of the KSRTC to the tourism segment is the idea of Managing Director Biju Prabhakar. Old deluxe buses kept off the road are being converted to provide lodging. The other hill stations and tourism destinations will also be ready soon with KSRTC accommodation in sleeper class, according to the sources.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fnwfkh/article32903753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvksrtc,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/come-to-munnar-stay-on-ksrtc-bus/article32903752.ece
139,2020/10/20,"Sivasankar feigned illness, Customs tells HC","Painkillers will ease his back pain, it says citing medical opinion

Former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister M.Sivasankar feigned illness and got himself admitted to the hospital where his wife worked to avoid questioning by the Customs in connection with the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, a statement filed by the Customs before the Kerala High Court said.

The statement was filed in response to an anticipatory bail petition filed by Mr. Sivasankar. The court had on Monday directed the Customs not to arrest him till October 23 in the case.

Opposing the bail plea, the Customs pointed out that the pretended illness had turned out to be fake in view of the medical opinion which said painkillers would take care of his back pain.

In fact, he had executed a vakalath for the anticipatory bail on October 14, anticipating his arrest. However, the place where had put in his signature was not shown in the vakalath. It showed that he had made all plans to pretend illness and get himself admitted to the hospital where his wife worked to avoid questioning by the Customs.

Besides, his petition for anticipatory bail was not maintainable. It was mandatory under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that the person who moved the petition should satisfy the court that he was charged with non-bailable offences and that he feared arrest in connection with the offences. Both these statements were absent in his petition. He had not specifically stated about the offence he had been charged with.

In his petition. Mr.Sivasankar said despite questioning him on many occasions, investigation agencies, including the customs, did not get any incriminating material to implicate him in the gold smuggling case.

He apprehended that if he was arrested, Customs officials would manhandle him. He also feared that the Customs would manage to register new crimes without any basis and get the petitioner remanded to satisfy political wisdom as well as other vested interests. Besides, the custodial interrogation of the petitioner was not required.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sivasankar-feigned-illness-customs-tells-hc/article32903728.ece
140,2020/10/20,COVID caseloads slumps to 470,"Five more deaths reported, 13 health workers test positive

The daily COVID-19 caseload in the district went below 500 for the first time on Tuesday after the major surge in cases began. A total of 470 positive cases were reported from the district.

141,2020/10/20,Cong. divided over tie-up with WPI,"UDF to take up issue at its meeting in Kochi on Friday

The Congress in the State appears to be on the horns of dilemma in the wake of a meeting between United Democratic Front (UDF) convener M.M. Hassan and Jamaat-e-Islami Amir M.I. Abdul Aziz which has sparked off a possible electoral alliance between the coalition and the Welfare Party of India (WPI) ahead of the local three tier polls in December and the Assembly elections next year.

A section within the Congress is infuriated over the speculation of the UDF attempting to forge a political understanding with the WPI, the political arm of Jamaat-e-Islami.

Two voices

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran has already voiced his thoughts bluntly against having a pact with the WPI and said that the UDF would discuss such issues at its meeting in Kochi on Friday.

At the same time, Vadakara MP K. Muraleedharan, who is in favour of an association with the WPI, said that party had publicly supported the UDF in Lok Sabha polls held last year and added that an entente had worked at local levels in districts such as Kozhikode.

A powerful section in the Congress is against forging any electoral understanding with the WPI for fear of losing a chunk of the votes of the Hindu as well as the conservative Muslim communities.

IUML factor

The schism in the Congress has emerged when the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), its largest coalition partner, also faced a similar dilemma earlier when hawkish elements in its party argued for such a tactical agreement.

However, the IUML has been to an extent able to tackle the issue by bringing its leader P.K. Kunhalikutty back to State politics when the party-backed Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama took an antagonistic view against the WPI.

Incidentally, the IUML has also started to engage in collective bargaining for more seats to contest in the Assembly polls, especially in Southern and Central Travancore, following the exit of the Kerala Congress (M) faction of Jose K. Mani and the Loktantrik Janata Dal, earlier JD(U), from the UDF.

More seats

Apparently a meeting between Mr. Hassan and IUML State president Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal in Malappuram saw the latter demanding six additional seats not only in north kerala but also in South and Central parts of the State.

In 2016, it contested 24 seats and won from 18 segments while the Kerala Congress (M) and the JD(U) had contested in 15 and seven seats respectively. The IUML leadership has been facing pressure from its youth wing to allot more seats for fresh faces.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cong-divided-over-tie-up-with-wpi/article32902099.ece
142,2020/10/20,Going vocal for local,"6-member team on 36-day expedition to promote domestic tourism

They are at Kovalam as part of a 36-day expedition throughout the country to promote Domestic Tourism and help revive the tourism industry hit badly by the pandemic-induced lockdown.

Led by Rajiv Shah from Surat, the six-member team of travel agents, moving in two cars, has reached here to spread the message ‘Vocal for Local’ and to persuade citizens to travel within the country.

The team comprising Ritesh Parekh, Sanjay Patel, Nitin Gupta, all from Surat, Pawan Dubey from Mumbai and Thomas Koshy from Ahmedabad, will cover over 18,000 km in 36 days. They will be going to the four corners of the country — Koteshwar in the west, Leh in the north, Tezu in the east and Kanyakumari in south — and capitals of 34 States.

During the trip, they will interact with local travel fraternity. Besides, they are motivating people to begin domestic travel by telling them how hotels and destinations are COVID-ready and looking forward to welcoming guests with utmost health and safety measures.

Mr. Shah said as Unlock is going on in phases and everything was falling back to place, travel industry also deserved the chance to bounce back. As international travel was not possible with flights yet to resume in full gear, only domestic tourism could help revive the industry.

Along with ATTOI, SKHF, IATO, SKAL, KTM, TAAI, SIHRA, KHRA and ADTOI, the Kovalam Hotel Association gave a reception to the team on Tuesday evening in the presence of Shreevats Sanjay, Regional Director, South, India Tourism.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/going-vocal-for-local/article32902031.ece
143,2020/10/20,Two major SMart City projects launched,"Redevelopment work of Rajaji Nagar and construction of smart roads get underway

The redevelopment work of Rajaji Nagar and construction of smart roads, two major projects under the city Corporation’s Smart City project, were launched on Tuesday.

Minister for Local Self Governments A.C. Moideen inaugurated the first phase of works at Rajaji Nagar. A masterplan has been prepared for the redevelopment work at Rajaji Nagar, spread over an area of 12.6 acres.

In the first phase, construction work will be carried out in 2.81 acres of land accommodating 248 dwelling units in eight blocks. Livelihood centres, community hall, and green open spaces for recreation are also part of the project. A space within the premises is allocated for solid waste management that will have aerobic bins and dry waste segregation hub. Solar panels will be installed on the rooftop of these eight blocks.

Each dwelling unit will have a hall (living-cum-dining area), two bedrooms (one bedroom with attached toilet), kitchen, two toilets, and a balcony area. The area of each dwelling unit will be 586 sq.ft. Initially, about 180 households will be temporarily shifted out of the Phase I area for construction purposes. The project cost for the first phase of redevelopment at Rajaji Nagar is ₹61.42 crore and is expected to be completed in two years.

The Smart roads project will cover a stretch of 9.86 kilometres of Corporation roads spread over nine wards in the core city area, including the Palayam, Vazhuthacaud, Vanchiyoor and Chala wards. As part of this, shifting of the KSEB, KWA and other utility cables would be carried out in the primary phase for which multi-utility ducts will be constructed. Once all the lines are shifted, all the electric poles along these roads will be removed.

Resurfacing of roads, road junction improvement, and upgrading of stormwater drainage will be carried out in parallel manner. Other improvements planned at road surface levels, including landscaping, signages and road markings, would be taken up in the final phase. New footpaths will be laid, cycle tracks and street furniture will be added. The objective is to provide safe and walkable streets in all public zones, tree plantation along major roads, organised on-street parking, and 100% coverage of automated LED-based street lighting.

In addition, roads under the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB) will be upgraded to smart roads as part of a separate tender floated by the KRFB. Within the nine wards, 36.94 kilometres of roads will be transformed into smart roads at a cost of ₹418.1 crore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/two-major-smart-city-projects-launched/article32902011.ece
144,2020/10/20,Only 12% of Kudumbashree NHGs involved in income-generating activities: study,"For a large section of members, groups work as a source of credit

Only about 12% of Kudumbashree neighbourhood groups (NHGs) in rural Kerala are involved in income-generating activities, and for a large section of its members, the NHGs mainly work as a source of credit and easy means to access government-given benefits, says a pre-COVID-19 study of indebtedness among rural households in the State.

At the same time, the Kudumbashree Mission, established in 1997, has emerged as the second biggest source of formal credit for rural women after primary agricultural cooperative banks, says the study by Kochi-based Centre for Socio-Economic and Environment conducted in 12 districts.

The wide acceptance of Kudumbashree has drawn rural women away from moneylenders and other informal sources.

A total of 540 households with yellow and pink ration cards, who are priority targets of the public distribution system, were chosen for the study. Three wards and 45 households were drawn from each panchayat on a random sampling basis.

Loans availed of through NHGs largely go into house construction or renovation, healthcare, purchase of consumer durables, repayment of existing loans and meeting expenses arising from social obligations, the study says.

No exception

The pattern of using most of the credit for consumption is visible across the spectrum of loan sources, and Kudumbashree group loans, as such, are no exception though the mission prescribes that bank-linkage loans availed of by NHG members should preferably be used to create income-generating activities.

“Only a meagre share of Kudumbashree loans have been utilised for directly productive or income-generating activities such as business or agriculture,” says the study, which raised a question about the long-term viability of NHGs because a significant number of Kudumbashree members considered thrift loan as not having a stringent repayment schedule and gave it a low priority for repayment.

The study suggests that given the wide acceptance of the Kudumbashree network, the mission should be ‘revitalised as a facilitator of income-generating activities.’ Perception of the Kudumbashree as an easy source of credit should be changed. Understanding factors limiting the involvement of NHGs in income-generating activities is necessary to develop a strategy for improving the livelihood of the rural poor, the study adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/only-12-of-kudumbashree-nhgs-involved-in-income-generating-activities-study/article32901978.ece
145,2020/10/20,Sabarimala pilgrim season: HC asks govt. to reconsider proposals,"‘Panel on crowd management had no TDB representative’

As the authorities seek to regulate the forthcoming Mandala-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season in Sabarimala in view of COVID-19, the Kerala High Court has asked the government to reconsider some of its proposals with “wiseful suggestions” from the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB).

In a recent order, the Division Bench comprising Justice C.T. Ravikumar and Justice K. Haripal noted that none representing the TDB was included in the Chief Secretary-led committee constituted by the State government to decide on crowd management during the upcoming Sabarimala pilgrimage season. It further gave the Board the liberty to submit appropriate proposals with all required details to enable the committee to revisit its decision on capping the number of pilgrims on week days and weekends.

On annadanam

The court also raised concern over a decision by the State government to serve annadanam (free meals) in “limited quantities” and asked the TDB to take appropriate steps to ensure its supply to the pilgrims. “The pilgrims from faraway places, after tiresome trekking, should be given free food to satisfy the appetite. The concept of giving annadanam in limited quantity is alien to the concept of annadanam, especially in Sabarimala,” the order said.

On viri at Nilakkal

Similarly, the court found the decision not to permit devotees set up viri (temporary shed) at Nilakkal, the base camp of Sabarimala, unacceptable. If the facility presently available at the location is not sufficient enough to accommodate the pilgrims to stay for some hour before proceeding to or after returning from the hill shrine, arrangements should be made.

“This is essential because if pilgrims from faraway places reach Nilakkal during night, they may not be able to proceed to Sannidhanam straight away. So also there is no justification for virtually requiring the devotees who return from Sannidhanam after 9.30 p.m. and reach Nilakkal to leave Nilakkal during the late hours,” read the order.

Light vehicles permitted

As against the decision to prohibit private vehicles beyond Nilakkal, the court also permitted light vehicles with a seating capacity of 15 to ply beyond the point for dropping and picking up devotees from Pampa. According to the court, the decision, to certain extent, will act as an effective measure for containment of the pandemic.

Noting that the movement of TDB officials and employees of various departments through the virtual queue might create undue difficulties, the court called for further discussion on the matter to take an appropriate decision in adherence to the safety protocols.

Earlier, Sabarimala Special Commissioner and District Judge M. Manoj had submitted a report before the court detailing the challenges involved in conducting the pilgrimage in view of COVID-19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabarimala-pilgrim-season-hc-asks-govt-to-reconsider-proposals/article32901781.ece
146,2020/10/20,Gaining equivalence fighting odds,"Transgenders being helped by Samanwaya continuing education programme

Thiruvananthapuram

Karthik D. had just completed his Plus One in private mode when is mother passed away. Some other factors also prevented him from completing his Plus Two. He did a few short-term courses in the interim, and it was only three years later when he heard about the Kerala State Literacy Mission’s higher secondary equivalency course that he enrolled for it.

Today, not only has Karthik, a transman, completed the course, along with 17 other people from the transgender community across the State, he has also gained admission to the BA History course at University College here.

Karthik says he always wanted to complete his education, and had shared his interest with other people from his community, particularly Shyama S. Prabha of the State government’s Transgender Cell. So when they informed him of the literacy mission’s course, he grabbed at the opportunity.

Again, it was his community that guided him as he debated which course to opt for in college to attain his dream–the Civil Services.

Karthik did not face financial difficulties during the course—the stipend of ₹1,250 a month from the literacy mission helped. His father and transgender community member Sreekutty Namitha were there to support him.

What is particularly satisfying about completing his Plus Two is that his certificates have his new identity and photograph, unlike his SSLC certificate, says the 22-year-old transman.

For the past month, Karthik has been driving the e-rickshaw of the city Corporation. He hopes he can continue driving it at night after he has completed his college studies. His concern at the moment is how to attend the classes online without a proper mobile phone or laptop. The Transgender Cell, he says, had been distributing equipment for online classes, but his results were not out then.

Along with Karthik, Sreekutty Namitha, Renjini Pillai, and Ishaan K. Shaan have completed the course in Humanities from the district. Their classes were held at SMV School every second Saturday and every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., says course coordinator Shamila R.

Two transgender persons from Kollam, and one each from Thrissur, Kozhikode, and Kannur have completed the equivalency course as part of the Samanwaya continuing education programme which focussed on the community. The maximum number passed from Pathanamthitta–eight. In all, 22 transgender persons had appeared for the examinations.

So far, 39 people from the transgender community have passed the Class 10 equivalency course, while 30 are currently pursuing it. There are 62 transgender persons in the higher secondary equivalency course.

Among the specially trained teachers who lead the Samanwaya programme are three from the transgender community.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gaining-equivalence-fighting-odds/article32901724.ece
147,2020/10/20,Reconstitute SIT in Palathayi case: HC,"Court asks govt. to replace IG Sreejith as head of probe team

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday directed the State Police Chief (SPC) to reconstitute the entire Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the Palathayi child abuse case.

The case related to the sexual base of a Class IV student by K. Padmarajan, schoolteacher and a local BJP leader in Palathayi in Kannur.

The court also directed that a new Inspector General of Police be appointed as its head, replacing IG S. Sreejith.

The SPC was directed to issue an order appointing new officers within two weeks.

Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan passed the order on a petition filed by the mother of the Palathayi child abuse case victim, seeking to reconstitute the SIT.

When the petition came up for hearing, Senior State Prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy submitted that if the mother of the victim did not want Mr. Sreejith to head the SIT, the government did not have any objection in removing him from the team. The State government wanted to protect the interest of the victim and her family at any cost.

Petitioner’s grouse

The mother pointed out in her petition that her minor daughter would not get justice from the present investigation team led by Mr. Sreejith.

Even after six months of investigation, the SIT could not make any headway. The delay in completing the investigation was deliberate and aimed at providing undue advantage to the accused. Besides,that it was against the POCSO Act which provides for expeditious investigation and trial, the petitioner said.

She alleged that the investigation team did not make any effort to rectify the anomalies and lapses pointed out by the public prosecutor. The victim had been subjected to mental torture and harassment many times by the counsellors and police officers.

Besides, the investigation team did not record the statement of the child by audio-video electronic means as specified under Section 26(4) of the Act. The petitioner also sought to restrain the SIT from submitting the final report before a POCSO court in Kasaragod.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/reconstitute-sit-in-palathayi-case-hc/article32901714.ece
148,2020/10/20,A fatigued health system battles critical-care demands,"System saturation and shortage of trained professionals lead to compromised ICU care and higher mortality

As COVID-19 pushes up the demand for critical-care facilities, late presentation in hospitals with respiratory distress and other symptoms is emerging as one of the primary reasons why more people are ending up in ICUsand ventilators, according to critical-care physicians.

If such people who are likely to develop complications can be picked up early, appropriate interventions can reduce mortality significantly.

The current problem is two dimensional. COVID patients with mild illness and in home care are ending up in ICUsafter they develop complications past the fifth or seventh day and turn up late in hospitals

But mortality rate is higher in the case of those patients who are rushed to the casualty with serious illness and whose COVID-positivestatus becomes known only at that point in time. These are usually people with uncontrolled diabetes or asthma but who may not recognise their symptoms to be linked to COVID. These are the kind of cases which the system should track, investigate and prevent through active surveillance.

Home care for asymptomatic or mild cases of COVID can be effective only if the system can monitor patients closely. However, many people still have not been made aware of the importance of monitoring oxygen saturation and most do not have pulse oximeterat home too.

“COVID is a complex disease which affects individuals differently and unless the health system is primed to watch out for the various signs and symptoms that signal a patient’s downhill path, a lot of preventable deaths will happen. But the health system is fatigued and its efficiency will continue to slide as the pandemic persists,” a senior public health expert points out.

“Interventions at the right time is the key to reducing patient mortality. But our current problem is the late presentation of people from home on day 9 or 10 with complications. Delay in recognising oxygen desaturation can be dangerous. COVID patients in home care should be taught about the possible danger signs and the importance of immediate medical attention,” R. Anoopkumar, Consultant in Critical Medicine, Baby Memorial Hospital, says.

COVID complications usually set in after seventh and even patients who had mild or no symptoms need to be careful during this time. People with co-morbidities, especially renal disease or asthma, should watch out for excessive fatigue, fever spikes and respiratory issues, which can happen quite suddenly.

High mortality

It is not possible to develop expertise in critical care in a week’s crash course and in many ICUshastily opened up during the pandemic, the management of critically ill patients has been less than perfect.

“The outcome of our patients who go on ventilators have been quite bad because of the lack of trained ICU staff and the absence of 1:1 nursing care. We can try to prevent patients going into ventilators by putting them on high flow nasal oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and awake proning, but all of this requires dedicated nursing care, which we are short of,” a senior doctor at ThiruvananthapuramGovernment Medical College Hospital says.

If Kerala’scase fatality has been low, ICU mortality figures speak differently. About 66 % to 91% of COVID patients who required mechanical ventilation have been dying .

This is quite alarming when compared to other viral pneumonia patients put on ventilators during 2017-19 wherein 78% patients were discharged home and only 22 % died, according to the figures given out by ThrissurGovernment MCH.

“The epidemic pattern here is no different from what happened elsewhere in the world, where system saturation and the shortage of trained professionals led to compromised ICU care and higher mortality. Intensivistscannot be created overnight, which is why the State should have focussed better on improving ICU training right from the initial days of the pandemic. The proposal for setting up teleICUsis a thought in the right direction,” says Dr. Anoopkumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-fatigued-health-system-battles-critical-care-demands/article32901634.ece
149,2020/10/20,Stand-off in actor rape case trial continues,"Prosecution seeks transfer of trial to another court

The stand-off between the prosecution and the trial court considering actor rape case continued with the Special Public Prosecutor abstaining from the court on Tuesday.

Joseph Manavalan, the counsel representing the prosecution informed the Additional Special Sessions Court (SPE/CBI)-3, Ernakulam, which is considering the case, that a petition seeking the transfer of trial to another court was being filed.

The court, which recorded the submission of the prosecution, asked the investigating officer in the case to make immediate steps for resuming the trial in the wake of the Supreme Court directive for the speedy completion of the trial.

The trial was suspended last Thursday on a request from the Special Prosecutor who sought time to to move the High Court to transfer the trial to any other court in the “interest of justice.”

Cancellation of bail

Meanwhile, the trial court has posted for Wednesday, the petitions for cancellation of bail granted to actor Dileep and his petition seeking action against media houses for allegedly reporting the procedures in the case.

The actor’s complaint against some of the members of the Women Collective in Cinema (WCC) for making statements against a few cinema actors would also be considered on the day. The WCC members had alleged in a social media post that some actors, who were examined as witnesses in the case, had turned hostile.

In its petition to the trial court, the prosecution had also raised the apprehension that justice would be denied to the victim in the case in which Dileep is an accused, if the case was tried before the present court.

Incidentally, the prosecution had earlier moved another petition seeking to cancel the bail granted to Dileep on the grounds that he had attempted to influence the witnesses in the case.

‘Partisan approach’

The prosecution is also understood to have filed a complaint before the Registrar General of the Kerala High Court against what it termed as the partisan approach of the trial court judge.

The agency is likely to move a petition before the Kerala High Court shortly seeking to issue directives for a change of court as it believed that a fair trail would not be possible before the present court.

Though the examination of few witnesses has also been scheduled for the day, the prosecutor is unlikely to turn up, according to sources.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/stand-off-in-actor-rape-case-trial-continues/article32901616.ece
150,2020/10/20,HC dismisses CBI plea to vacate stay,"Probe into alleged irregularities in LIFE Mission project at Wadakkanchery

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday turned down the plea by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for vacating its interim order staying the probe against U.V. Jose, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of LIFE Mission, in connection with the alleged irregularities in the LIFE Mission project at Wadakkanchery in Thrissur.

The High Court had last week stayed for two months further proceedings in the investigation against the LIFE Mission CEO even as it allowed the CBI to go ahead with the investigation against Santhosh Eappen, MD of the Unitac, a contracting company and the first accused in the case.

The interim stay order came on petitions filed by the LIFE Mission CEO and Santhosh Eappen seeking to quash the FIR registered by CBI.

Counter-affidavit

When the petition of the CBI seeking to vacate the interim stay order came up for hearing, the court asked CBI counsel whether it had filed any counter-affidavit in the case, to which the counsel replied that the affidavit had been sent to the CBI Director for approval. It would soon be filed, the counsel informed the court.

The court then said that the case could be taken up for a final hearing once the CBI filed the counter-affidavit.

The State government submitted that the CBI attempt was to draw the attention of the media and humiliate it.

CBI submission

The CBI submitted in its petition that it could not collect the relevant files of the LIFE Mission project from the State government on account of the stay order. Besides, it could not continue with the probe as it was not able to question and summon the LIFE Mission officers, government servants and others who were acquainted with facts of the case. In fact, the stay order had created serious hurdles in the investigation.

The investigation agency pointed out that the High Court had observed while issuing the stay order that larger legal questions involved in the case required to be determined. In fact, the CBI was willing to argue the case as early as possible.

The case involved the interests of the state and serious investigation needs to be conducted to unearth the deeper conspiracy in the case. Therefore, the CBI pleaded for vacating the stay order in the interests of justice.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-dismisses-cbi-plea-to-vacate-stay/article32901563.ece
151,2020/10/20,"Allow overnight stay at Nilakkal, says HC","It asks State to revisit curbs on pilgrim numbers and timings, Annadanam “in limited quantity”

Observing that the COVID-19 safety protocol should not ultimately affect a safe Sabarimala pilgrimage, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has ordered that pilgrims who reach Nilakkal at night on their way to or on return from Sannidhanam in the coming Madalam-Makaravilakku season be allowed to stay overnight at Nilakkal.

The Bench comprising Justice C.T. Ravikumar and Justice A. Hariapal, while considering the reports of Sabarimala Special Commissioner and the State government regarding the arrangements being made for the coming Sabarimala pilgrimage season, observed that as Nilakkal continued to be the base camp, facilities to stay at Nilakkal temporarily or overnight before proceeding to and also on their return after the darshan, should be provided to those pilgrims who required such arrangement. This was essential because those pilgrims reaching Nilakkal from faraway places at night might not be able to proceed to Sannidhanam straightaway.

The court said that there was no justification for virtually requiring devotees who returned from Sannidhanam after 9.30 p.m. and reached Nilakkal to leave in the late hours.

The court also ordered that sufficient facilities to accommodate the devotees who wanted to stay back at Nilakkal be provided.

The Bench ordered the State government to revisit the limit imposed on the number of pilgrims to be allowed during weekdays and holidays, as also on the Mandalapuja and Makaravilakku days, at Sannidhanam after giving due attention to all relevant aspects, including the number of hours available for darshan, the number of devotees who could be permitted in front of the Sreekovil at a time etc.

Private vehicles

The court also orders that the government have a re-look at the decision to prevent private vehicles from being taken beyond Nilakkal.

The court directed the government to limit the number of State guests and the guests of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) who could be allowed at Sabarimala. The entry of State guests without limiting their numbers might ultimately defeat the very purpose of the safety protocol, the Bench said.

The court also ordered the government to take a re-look at its decision to conduct Annadanam “in limited quantity” to pilgrims. It said pilgrims from faraway places who reached Sabarimala after a tiresome trek should be given food to satisfy their appetite. The concept of conducting “Annadanam in limited quantity” was alien to the concept of Annadanam, especially at Sabarimala, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/allow-overnight-stay-at-nilakkal-says-hc/article32901557.ece

‘Kerala Neem G’ auto rickshaws, from the public sector-run Kerala Automobiles Limited, will hit the streets of Nepal from November.

The first lot of 25 eco-friendly electric vehicles for Nepal, from the Kerala Automobiles Limited’s (KAL) plant at Aralumoodu, near Thiruvananthapuram, were shipped from the State capital on Tuesday by road. The two trucks will arrive with the consignment in Nepal in 12 days.

The KAL has also got orders for eight more e-autos from Nepal and they will be shipped soon. The Nepal government is procuring the e-autos through Himalaya Motrrad Private Ltd. as part of ushering in e-mobility. The cost of transportation is borne by the dealer.

For KAL, it is its first export after 17 years. It is also the first export of the electric e-auto rickshaw from the country by a public sector undertaking of a State.

Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan flagged off the ‘Kerala Neem G’ autorickshaws in the presence of KAL Chairman Karamana Hari, Managing Director A. Shajahan, Chairman, Public Sector Restructuring and Internal Audit Board (RIAB) N. Sasidharan Nair and officials of KAL and RIAB.

The aim is to sell 500 e-autos in Nepal annually. Talks are on to export KAL’s e-auto to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Kenya, the Minister said.

The three-seater environment-friendly ‘Kerala Neem G’ auto rickshaws are being sold to Nepal for ₹2.85 lakh, the same rate as in the country.

153,2020/10/20,Sivasankar feigned illness to avoid an interrogation by customs,"Former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, M. Sivasankar, had feigned illness and got himself admitted in a hospital in Thruvananthapuram where his wife works to avoid questioning by the customs in connection with the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, according to a statement filed by the Customs before the Kerala High Court.

The statement was filed in response to an anticipatory bail petition filed by the Senior IAS officer. The court had on Tuesday directed the Customs not to arrest him till October 23 in the case.

The Customs pointed out that that the pretended illness had turned out to be a fake in view of the medical opinion which said that pain killers would take care of his backpain. Besides, he had executed a vakalath for the anticipatory bail on October 14 in Kochi before leaving for Thiruvananthapuram. However, the place where had put in his signature was not shown in the Vakalath. It shows that he had made all plans to pretend illness and get himself admitted in a hospital where his wife works to avoid questioning by the Customs.

Besides, his petition for anticipatory bail was not maintainable. It was mandatory under section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that the person who moved such petition should satisfy the court that he was charged with non-bailable offences and that he feared arrest in connection with the offences. Both these statements were absent in his petition. He had not specifically stated about the offences he had been charged with.

In his petition. Mr. Sivasankar said that despite questioning him on many occasions, the investigation agency including the customs did not get any incriminating materials to implicate him in the gold smuggling case. He apprehended that if he was arrested, the Customs officials would manhandle him. He also feared that the Customs would manage to register new crimes without any basis and get the petitioner remanded to satisfy political wisdom as well as other vested interests. Besides, custodial interrogation of the petitioner was not required.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sivasankar-feigned-illness-to-avoid-an-interrogation-by-customs/article32899784.ece

158,2020/10/20,"Vardhan’s comments should not be taken as criticism of Kerala’s COVID-19 management, says Pinarayi Vijayan","'The COVID-19 situation in the state was under control during and after the Onam festive season as a strict vigil was enforced'

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan’s recent comments on rising coronavirus cases in Kerala should not be taken as a criticism of the state government’s COVID-19 management.

With Kerala witnessing a spurt in infections recently, Mr. Vardhan said the state was “paying the price for gross negligence” during Onam festivities when unlocking of services along with an increase in travel for trade and tourism led to the spread of COVID-19.

However, Mr. Vijayan blamed an “irresponsible opposition” for the rising cases.

“The recent comments by the Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Harsh Vardhan should not be taken as a criticism of the efforts of the state in Covid management,” Mr. Vijayan said.

The Chief Minister said the COVID-19 situation in the state was under control during and after the Onam festive season as a strict vigil was enforced.

“Our COVID preventive measures were a success but the massive protests across the state by an irresponsible opposition derailed the efforts of the government,” Mr. Vijayan said.

He said Kerala was the first place in the country to develop a COVID-19 protocol while social distancing and public awareness campaigns were started in the state before anywhere else.

He added that Kerala was first in the country to implement a statewide lockdown. “The state was successful in containing the number of deaths due to COVID-19. The government’s efforts were to delay the outbreak of the pandemic from peaking and it used the time gained in the process to strengthen the medical and health infrastructure facilities,” Vijayan said.

He said the COVID-19-related death rate in Kerala was low as the government had applied a scientific approach towards reducing mortality among coronavirus patients.

From a 0.77% mortality rate in May, the decline was gradual as it came down to 0.28% in October (till date), the Chief Minister said, adding that, it is a proud achievement that the state government was able to bring down the mortality rate even at this stage when the numbers of new cases were high.

“This is the reason why our health sector has got several accolades at an international level,” Mr. Vijayan said.

159,2020/10/20,Govt. likely to examine hotelier’s allegation,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said the government might need to explore the assertion that an array of UDF leaders had accepted substantial amounts as bribe from the Kerala Bar Hotel Association (KBHA) in 2015 to expedite the relicensing of more than 300 bars the Oommen Chandy administration had shut down on the premise that they were unhygienic.

Hotelier Biju Ramesh, former acting president of the KBHA, had alleged on Monday that the guild of bar hotel owners had collected and paid substantial bribes to at least three prominent leaders other than Kerala Congress (M) leader and then Finance Minister K.M. Mani to get their businesses back on track. He had named K.M. Mani as a respondent in his complaint to an anti-corruption court here in 2015.

160,2020/10/20,‘Probe report’ launches another war of words,"Having fallen apart after an association lasting four decades the antagonism between the Congress and the Kerala Congress (M) led by Jose K. Mani is deepening, with both sides entering into a bitter fight over the bar bribery scam.

Intensifying its attack on the estranged ally, the District Congress Committee in Kottayam led by Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan and K.C. Joseph, MLAs, on Monday demanded the resignation of Mani group members from all seats they had won as United Democratic Front candidates. “Since Jose K. Mani has decided to step down as Rajya Sabha member to uphold the principle of political morality, the same should be applicable to others, including the Lok Sabha member from Kottayam,” Mr. Radhakrishnan said.

Protest at 5,000 locations

The Congress on Tuesday will stage protests at 5,000 locations across Kottayam demanding the resignation of Kottayam MP Thomas Chazhikadan and Kanjirappally MLA N. Jayaraj.

Responding to the alleged conspiracy behind the bar bribery case, Congress leader Joseph Vazhakkan challenged Mr. Mani to prove that even a single leader from the Congress was involved in it. “The so-called investigation report was fabricated by Mr. Mani with the support of his aides, including a hotelier in Kochi. If he continues to spread such lies for political gains, I will be forced to reveal more about the episode,” said Mr. Vazhakkan.

Mr. Vazhakkan’s remarks assume significance in view of the leakage of a report, purportedly prepared by a private agency, which accused Congress leaders, including Mr. Vazhakkan, of trapping K.M. Mani in the scam. Though Mr. Mani was quick to deny any link to the report, the Congress leadership regards it as a ploy by the estranged ally to put them under pressure.

Mr. Mani on Monday denied the allegations raised by Biju Ramesh, leader of the bar hotels’ association. “Those who hunted down my father are now targeting me. One can easily recognise the motive behind Mr. Ramesh coming up with a fresh set of allegations,” he said.

Joseph cautious

P.J. Joseph, leader of the rival KC(M) faction, was cautious in his response to the latest controversy. “It is up to Mr. Mani to respond to the allegations raised by Mr. Ramesh.

161,2020/10/20,KSRTC to switch to digital track in 2 years,"₹16.98 crore for updated electronic ticket machines, vehicle tracking, video walls

The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has commenced steps for the total computerisation of the State transport undertaking.

Among the key features are electronic ticketing machines with GPRS, RFID, and Bluetooth, smart cards for commuters, GPS-enabled vehicle tracking system, passenger information system and video walls at bus stands to provide information on bus schedules.

The government has sanctioned ₹16.98 crore to the KSRTC for the project, which will be completed in two years, according to Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran.

Pact with C-DAC

As the first step, the government has entered into a ₹2.5-crore agreement with C-DAC for the installation of a central control room for vehicle tracking based on GPS data. The tender process for the purchase of 5,500 electronic ticket machines has also begun. The machines will be procured by March 31 next year.

Chairman and Managing Director, KSRTC, Biju Prabhakar said salaries of employees in the main office at Transport Bhavan had already been transferred to SPARK, which would be in place at all depots from January 1 2021. From April 1 next year, all payments would be through SPARK.

Ticket machines will be integrated with the existing Online Passenger Reservation System (OPRS) for live booking. Passengers can make use of smart cards, which can be recharged online.

Long-distance buses will be equipped with GPS in the first phase. The facility will be extended to city services in Thiruvananthapuram and local services in other districts in the final phase.

Tracking buses

Passengers wanting to board a bus will be able to track the vehicle through an app, which will provide information as soon as the bus starts and update details. Information on approaching bus stops will be flashed on a display board inside long-distance buses.

A video wall will be set up at the bus stands to give updates on the arrival and departure of buses. The KSRTC aims to earn ₹10 crore a month in advertising revenue within three years, the CMD said.

A central control room has been set up at the Anayara terminal in the capital to monitor fuel consumption of buses through a system developed in association with the Indian Oil Corporation. An radio frequency identification (RFID) ring attached to the diesel tank of a bus will help know the fuel intake from the IOC pump in the depot. The facility is available at 20 of the 65 depots.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ksrtc-to-switch-to-digital-track-in-2-years/article32896321.ece
162,2020/10/20,Mix-up of COVID patients,"Body lay unidentified at mortuary

The body of an 85-year-old COVID-19 patient from Kollam lay unidentified for five days in the mortuary of the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. The incident has sparked allegations of negligence on the part of health officials.

Believing that his father was admitted at the Government Medical College Hospital at Paripally, Kollam, the patient’s son had continued to take food and clothes there for several days. The hospital authorities had accepted them without question.

In reality, the son, a headload worker in Kollam, had been taking food and clothes not to his father but to another COVID-19 patient with the same name. But it became evident only last week when hospital authorities informed him that his father, who had tested negative, was transferred to the room and he went there to meet him.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Monday that an investigation would be carried out into the incident.

The patient, who hails from Kunnikode in Kollam district, was taken to the Taluk Hospital, Punalur, on August 26 after he complained of uneasiness. He had contracted COVID-19 after 15 days at the hospital.

“'When I enquired at the hospital, they said he had been shifted to the Paripally MCH. There, I was told that he was at the COVID treatment centre at the SN College. I met him there,”' the son said. According to him, they had then shifted his father to the District Hospital, Kollam, but he was not informed. When he contacted the District Hospital, he was told that the patient was transferred to the Paripally MCH on September 25. On enquiring there, the hospital confirmed that his father was indeed admitted at the hospital, but visitors were barred.

On October 15, he was informed that his father had tested negative and shifted to the room. When he went to meet his father, it became evident that a mix-up had occurred. Finally, after several rounds of enquiries, he confirmed on October 16 that his father was admitted at the Government MCH, Thiruvananthapuram.

Passed away

Enquiries in Thiruvananthapuram confirmed that his father had passed away on October 13. While the hospital had taken down a wrong address for the patient, they had the correct mobile phone numbers of the deceased’s son and his wife, claims the son. The body of the deceased was finally released on October 18. The burial was held at the Jamaat at Kunnikode. The son said he has no plans to lodge complaints.

“'I consider it lucky that my father could be buried in Kunnikode. If the other patient had not tested negative and got shifted to the ward, I would still be taking clothes and food to the Paripally hospital thinking my father was there,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/lelt3x/article23393763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TVTVMEDICALCOLLEGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mix-up-of-covid-patients/article32896089.ece

Rasika: It’s been up and down like it has been for everybody else. I managed to keep myself busy. I did things I wouldn’t have before. I co-wrote a short film with my husband called The Banana Bread, which is about two people who live in a house and what they go through during the lockdown. It was a way of responding to the strange times we are living in.

The last one and a half years I was working continuously. So, I welcomed this pause though I wish the circumstance that led to it was different. A lot has happened in the news, starting with the migrant labour crisis, which was a big humanitarian crisis. I still can’t understand how something as careless as that could have happened in our country.

Shweta: After shooting for Mirzapur last September, I was at home waiting for the right kind of project. So, my lockdown, in a way, started early. That phase leading up the actual lockdown, was tough. I wasn’t happy with the work I was getting. There were tears, mood-swings and all that. But during the lockdown, I had a lot of work. I had promotions for my new releases: Raat Akeli Hai, Cargo and The Gone Game, which was shot at my home. That was exciting.

There was a considerable gap between seasons one and two of Mirzapur. Was it challenging to get back into your characters?

Rasika: What I found challenging was to revisit a character after listening to people talk about it. Once you have watched that character and heard many opinions about it, your personal equation with that character gets corrupted. So, I felt like I had to forget all that before going into season twp. So, that was my worry more than the time gap. We worked with the same team that did season one. And, they were so in sync with the characters. So, it was easier for me to reacquaint with my character.

Shweta: I signed up for Mirzapur because of season two. In the first, there isn’t much drama in Golu’s life. And, I am someone who loves drama. Also, we did season one without much expectation. But the show became a big hit. And, the kind of love I received for Golu put some pressure on me. The character has completely flipped from season one. Her situations have changed. The people she loved have been taken away from her. She looks different. Her hair is shorter, there’s a scar on her face, clothes have changed.

Mirzapur has a sprawling cast. Do you closely follow the story arcs of all the characters or do you focus on your characters and the ones they interact with?

Rasika: I read the whole script. But I don’t watch the series so many times after it’s out. It’s a disconcerting experience to watch yourself on screen all the time. I have watched the show only once in its entirety.

Shweta: I don’t follow the character graphs of others. When you are reading the script for the first time, you want to know what happens. So, that’s exciting. But in a long show, it’s difficult to store all the information about everyone.

As actors, do web series liberate you, in terms of your performances and the choices of roles, as compared to cinema?

Shweta: As actors, good roles liberate us. It depends on the project. It could even be a radio show with just my voice. But a web series allows more time to explore characters. So, I love sinking my teeth into such fleshed out characters. The characters you see in OTT aren’t dry-cleaned. They are flawed yet you love them.

Rasika: A well-written story liberates me. It doesn’t matter if it’s for a film or OTT. But streaming platforms have written pathbreaking content over the last few years. The long format also gives room for the entire ensemble to flourish. I have wondered if Beena Tripathi could have been a strong character in a film. Maybe she would have been a victim of editing. It’s not to say that cinema has less interesting content. Qissa, for instance, has been my best experience as an actor. But I have never been a part of many mainstream cinema. So, I can’t comment on that.

Do you see OTT platforms as a totally different ballgame compared to cinema? Do you prioritise one over the other?

Shweta: I think the priority is always for good stories and roles. It depends on who you are working with. But I think web series is a bigger commitment. In a way, it’s a bigger risk. If a film of yours is bad, you can move on to the next one. But if the first season of a series is bad, you might still have to stick with it till it's over. And, because of the duration of the show, it’s more challenging to act in a series as well. You have to stay with the character for a long time.

Rasika: I actually enjoy shooting in the longer format. Because I feel you get more time to sink into the character. With a film, I have to walk in very prepared. In case my preparation is not in sync with the director’s vision, then I have to totally realign quickly. But in a series, I have more time to warm up to my character. The scenes also have a leisurely quality to them. Even the characters, who might not be central to the main plot, are explored.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3pw2fs/article32901969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mirzapur-ShwetaTripathijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-women-of-mirzapur-rasika-dugal-and-shweta-tripathi-talk-about-the-shows-second-season/article32901970.ece

165,2020/10/20,"‘Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story’ review: A gripping saga, shot artfully","The web-series on SonyLIV revisits the story of India’s first major financial fraud by making use of some brilliant writing and succinct acting chops of its lead actors

A fragile economic system on the brink of turning itself inside out. A madcap wheeler-dealer’s indomitable drive to make a fortune. A relentless truth-seeker on a mission to expose the unprepossessing face of naked greed. This is the story of an era when a single man’s unabashed debauchery crashed the Bombay Stock exchange single-handedly, and with it, the aspirations of an entire generation.

Hansal Mehta’s Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta story revisits this story of India’s first major financial fraud by making use of some brilliant writing and succinct acting chops of its lead actors. The show kicks off with Harshad Mehta’s meteoric rise from humble beginnings, as he becomes the ‘Big Bull’ of Mumbai’s Dalal Street.

Subsequently, this self-styled ‘Amitabh Bacchan of the Bombay Stock Exchange’ partakes in siphoning funds to the tune of ₹1000 crore from India’s financial markets. This sets in motion a chain of events which ultimately ends up in the 1992 stock market scam. The amount of money, which was wiped out by this financial catastrophe, was more than that in India’s education and health budgets at the time.

It was a journalist by the name of Sucheta Dalal who first exposed Mehta’s dubious financial undertakings. Later she wrote a book about it with her husband Debashish Basu titled, The Scam: Who Won, Who Lost, Who Got Away on which this SonyLIV web series is based.

Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story Director: Hansal Mehta

Cast: Pratik Gandhi, Sharib Hashmi, Shreya Dhanwanthary, Nikhil Dwivedi

No. of episodes: 10

Storyline: The story of India’s first major financial fraud, the 1992 Indian stock market scam, committed by stockbroker Harshad Mehta

At the heart of Scam 1992 lie the powerful, yet effortless performances by Gujrati theatre/ film actor Pratik Gandhi and former beauty queen Shreya Dhanwanthary. Gandhi brings to life Mehta, portraying him not as a sinister creature with foreboding intentions, but a man of flesh and blood. Dhanwantary, on the other hand, masterfully captures the frustration and angst that the real-life Sucheta Dalal was subjected to, as she embarked on untangling the crisis that Mehta left in his wake.

As for the depiction of India’s financial markets, the show, unlike its Indian predecessors, refrains from portraying it as a surreal fairyland where one can become rich overnight. Instead, it invests in explaining heavy market jargons like “Ready forward deal”, “Statutory Liquid Ratio” (SLR) and “Bank Receipts”(BR) — making it easy for the viewers to stay updated with Mehta’s conniving endeavours.

The show’s production design and cinematography too are of high quality as the crew manages to effectively give us a taste of the bygone period with much elan.

The Bombay of the late 70s, 80s and the early 90s was very different from the present-day Mumbai. It may not exist anymore, but the memories of people who lived in it, still do. The show does a brilliant job in recreating its old glory days, so much so that the city itself becomes a character in the tale.

Trademark drone shots (a staple in most recent dramas) at the start of each episode and the effectual use of camera angles light up each frame and provides viewers with a unique perspective to the story. The revolving dolly shot of Sucheta Dallal, conducting an interview of Mehta at one of the most crucial points of his story, stands out.

The show’s biggest flaw, however, is how it chooses to portray its supporting characters. The likes of Nikhil Dwivedi, K.K. Raina, Ananth Narayan Mahadevan and many others seem to be stuck in roles which wholly revolve around the lead character. Even when Pratik Gandhi’s Harshad Mehta is not seen on screen, the auxiliary characters seem to be only talking about him, plotting on how to get even or just bluntly cussing him out. Satish Kaushik as the head of the “bear cartel” shines nonetheless with his unforced comic timing and sombre poise, bringing an element of humour to the mix.

One also strongly feels that some of the over-the-top dialogues and on-screen gimmicks could have been avoided. Case in point, the “risk hai to ishq hai” dialogue which pops up now and again during the show’s runtime, seems unnecessary and even forced.

In a nutshell, Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story is a well-written show with its lead characters doing all the heavy lifting. Despite its flaws, it provides an intriguing sneak-peek at the untapped potential of homegrown content creators — and what they are capable of — if allowed to run wild with their imagination.

166,2020/10/20,"Queer short film ‘Bodies of Desire’ delves into themes of intimacy, identity","The film, directed by Varsha Panikar and Saad Nawab, stems from poetry and personal experiences

“The film delves into themes of identity, desire, discovery, sensuality and intimacy,” says Varsha Panikar about Bodies of Desire, which is based on her poetry series of the same name.

The spoken word, queer short film, directed by Varsha and Saad Nawab, was released last month and has been nominated and shortlisted at festivals, including the Berlin Commercial.

Stating that the film has a universal story, Varsha says, “We have shown different sexualities and the diversity of people that exist in cities. It comes from my own experiences: these are the kind of people I know, this is the kind of love I understand and have seen. I hope when people watch the film, they are able to see it from that lens, free of bias and prejudice, and not just see it as a queer film.

“Having said that, in the current socio-political climate, it is a queer film made by queer persons,” she adds.

Of the nine persons in the film, only two are professional actors. “They are from different walks of life; there is a copywriter, designer, activist, and a drag artiste. We wanted diversity because we wanted to use the film as a medium to showcase queer lives. So, we were looking for people from the community,” says Varsha, who has also provided the voiceover for the film.

Adds Saad, “We were aiming for a kind of authenticity that comes with people who have not faced the camera before. It’s less about sex, and more about the idea of intimacy. That’s what we were trying to aim at. So, there were certain barriers that we wanted them to be comfortable with but also come together in a certain way.”

The directors had an intimacy coach offering guidance on set, an uncommon practice in India. Says Varsha, “You need to create spaces that are safe, especially when shooting something like intimacy. You need to discuss the boundaries of consent and what the actors are comfortable with.”

The film also touches on the subject of female pleasure. As Varsha states, “There is a still a lot of shame associated with sexuality and desire.” She adds, “These are basic human emotions. I don’t think people need to shy away from it anymore. We’re in 2020; it’s high time we moved on.”

168,2020/10/20,Director Vishal Bhardwaj to develop film franchise based Agatha Christie’s works,"The first film will introduce a young heroine who is thrown into solving a murder, and teams up with an unlikely companion to unravel the case

Filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj is set to adapt renowned British mystery writer Agatha Christie’s works into a film franchise for Indian audiences. Christie’s crime stories centred on fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, but Bhardwaj will be introducing a new pair of lead investigators taking inspiration from one of the Queen of Crime’s famous stories.

According to a press release issued by the makers, the script is currently in development, but details of which Christie novel is being adapted for the first film have not been revealed yet.

The filmmaker-composer, best known for his acclaimed Shakespeare trilogy Maqbool, (Macbeth) Omkara (Othello) and Haider (Hamlet), is producing the franchise through his banner Vishal Bhardwaj Films in collaboration with Agatha Christie Limited (ACL), headed by Christie’s great-grandson James Prichard.

Bhardwaj said he is excited to embark on this journey and explore the turmoil and emotional chaos of Christie’s characters.

“Agatha Christie had a tremendous skill of defining emotional chaos, dysfunctional relationships and the turmoil in her characters while engaging us in a riveting mystery. It is an honour to create an Indian franchise of a pair of young investigators looking to take over the world with their intelligence and charm. ACL have been such amazing partners and we are all excited to be on this journey,” the director said in a statement.

The first film, scheduled to go on floors early next year, will introduce a young heroine who is thrown into solving a murder, and teams up with an unlikely companion to unravel the case. The cast is currently being finalised.

Future films will follow the duo as they continue to investigate multiple murder mysteries.

Prichard said he is looking forward to Bhardwaj’s take on his grandmother’s writings.

“I’m truly excited at the prospect of developing a new Agatha Christie film franchise in India, and am delighted to be partnering with Vishal, who is a multitalented and visionary filmmaker with a terrific track record for adapting works to create memorable pieces of cinema.”

“He has also demonstrated a real passion and understanding of my great grandmother’s characters and stories and I very much look forward to seeing where this project takes us,” he said.

170,2020/10/20,25 years of ‘Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge’: Shah Rukh Khan on the iconic film and looking ‘unconventional’,"Directed by then debutant Aditya Chopra, son of veteran filmmaker Yash Chopra, ‘DDLJ’ cemented Shah Rukh’s image as the ‘king of romance’ in Bollywood

Superstar Shah Rukh Khan has many fond memories of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ), which completed 25 years on Tuesday, but what stands out the most is how the film built his romantic hero image as the actor says he never felt he could pull of a character like that on the screen.

Directed by then debutant Aditya Chopra, son of veteran filmmaker Yash Chopra, “DDLJ” cemented Shah Rukh’s image as the ‘King of Romance’ in Bollywood.

“Raj was unlike anything I had done. Before ‘DDLJ’, there was ‘Darr’, ‘Baazigar’, ‘Anjaam’— films in which I had portrayed negative characters. Also, I always felt that I wasn’t cut out to play any romantic type of character,” he said.

“So, when I was presented with the opportunity by Adi and Yash (Chopra) ji of essaying the role, I was excited to work with him but had no idea how to go about it and also if I would be able to do it well,” Shah Rukh said in a statement shared by production banner Yash Raj Films (YRF).

The 54-year-old actor actor said people can see a glimpse of his real self in Raj, particularly in his sense of humour, which the actor borrowed from his own life.

“Actually, I always felt Adi’s love for me made him cast me. I found the character endearing and sweet in the right way —the over-the-topness is my contribution.”

“It was one of those roles that I realised can do with me using a version of my real self, so you might see some quirks, habits and mannerisms that were true to my off-screen persona, especially the sense of humour part,” he said.

Though Shah Rukh and Kajol had tasted success as a pair with “Baazigar” in 1993, it was “DDLJ” which immortalised them as the ultimate on-screen romantic couple.

DDLJ, the acronym that the film is known by today, shattered box office records at the time and was the only film to be still running in Mumbai’s Maratha Mandir until recently when COVID-19 forced cinema halls to close in March.

Widely credited for changing the grammar of Hindi cinema, the movie, according to YRF, was made at a budget of Rs 4 crore and in 1995 it collected Rs 89 crore in India and Rs 13.50 crore in overseas markets, a total collection of Rs 102.50 crore worldwide.

In today’s inflation adjusted value, the film’s collection stands at a staggering Rs 455 crore in India and Rs 69 crore in overseas territories, taking the total worldwide collections to Rs 524 crore, the production house said.

At that time, Shah Rukh recalled, he had been told that he looked unconventional, different from the leading heroes of that era, which made him sceptical about saying all the romantic dialogues in the movie.

“I was told by many people that I looked unconventional — very different from what the perception of a leading man was. I did feel, maybe, not being handsome enough — or as they called it then ‘chocolatey’ would make me unsuitable for romantic roles. Also, I am very shy and awkward with ladies, and I didn’t know how I would say all the loving, romantic bits,” he said.

“I have to admit, for someone who doesn’t like mushy, romantic films, the scenes with Kajol and I did make me feel all fuzzy and warm. There, I said it!” the actor said.

Shah Rukh also revealed he never changes the radio channel when a “DDLJ” song comes on.

“I can never get sick of them. They bring back memories of a film that shaped my path forward in an unforgettable way,” he said of the songs penned by the late Anand Bakshi and composed by Jatin-Lalit.

The train sequence ending of DDLJ is as iconic as the film, inspiring many imitations in Bollywood and elsewhere but Shah Rukh said he had no clue it will become so famous while they were shooting it: “There could have been no other ending, but I did not think it would be as iconic as it eventually turned out to be.”

The actor said “DDLJ” brought him fame in a way that he didn’t think it would.

“We were all living in the moment, trying to make the best film we could. There are so many reasons attributed to its success, but I don’t think any one specific thing can explain the phenomenon it has become. I think all the success is to be credited to the pure heart with which the film was made by Adi, Yashji, and the entire cast and crew — and my non-existent ‘good looks’,” he said.

Thanks to the film, Shah Rukh said he could no longer rely on his unconventional looks to play different roles.

“As for perception, I always felt that I can play more unconventional roles because of my looks, but ‘DDLJ’ has belied that and I still struggle to make that one macho unconventional kick a** character which suits me, or so I thought, but its been a struggle to not be considered romantic and sweet for the last 25 years —a struggle, I guess, I am happy to lose.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/n3nvn7/article32898980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DilwaleDulhaniaLeJayenge1995,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/25-years-of-dilwale-dulhania-le-jayenge-shah-rukh-khan-on-the-iconic-film-and-looking-unconventional/article32898981.ece
171,2020/10/20,Appu N Bhattathiri on directing ‘Nizhal’ with Nayanthara and Kunchacko Boban,"The film, a mystery-thriller, marks the directorial début of the State award-winning editor

Nayanthara teaming up with Kunchacko Boban is the big news from Mollywood. The movie, titled Nizhal, marks the directorial début of State award-winning editor, Appu N Bhattathiri. Before the film went on floors on Monday (October 19) at Kalamassery near Kochi, Appu talked to MetroPlus about the project and fulfilling his dream of turning director.

“Nizhal is a mystery thriller. That’s all I can say as of now,” says Appu, adding that casting Nayanthara was not in the scheme of things when they had started the project. “The film has powerful male and female leads. Chackochan [Kunchacko Boban] was finalised for his role at the beginning itself. It was he who suggested having Nayanthara on board. That thought had never crossed our mind because it didn’t seem to be a possibility. The role indeed required someone like her, thanks to the connect she has made with the audience through her multiple strong characters,” says Appu. Nayantara’s last release in Malayalam was Dhyan Sreenivasan’s Love Action Drama, opposite Nivin Pauly.

Appu has been nurturing dreams of becoming a filmmaker for many years now. “Initially, I wanted to become a cinematographer. But, after a point, direction enthused me. However, I was forced to take up editing,” he laughs. While pursuing his graduation in digital media in Chennai, he would edit short films made by his friends. Even after finishing his course, he continued to do it as it became a source of income. He worked in numerous short films, most of them directed by his friends, and also directed a few shorts.

The 31-year-old from Thiruvananthapuram started his career as an assistant director in Second Show (2012), the launch vehicle of Dulquer Salmaan, and debuted as an editor in Sanal Kumar Sasidharan’s Oraalppokkam (2014). He won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Editor (2017) for Ottamurivelicham and Veeram and has also worked in three other state-award-winning films.

“Even though I badly wanted to switch over to direction all these years I couldn’t do that. In fact, I set out three times to direct a movie but the projects didn’t materialise. Maybe, I am lucky for the fourth time now,” he says.

Talking about the genre, Appu says that he has always been a huge fan of thrillers. “I have edited very few such scenes in the films I have worked. Compared to Tamil and Hindi, there aren’t many gripping thrillers in Malayalam. So I always wanted to bring that in my film,” he says, making special reference to David Fincher’s movies such as SE7EN and Zodiac.

As for the COVID-19 restrictions in place on the shooting location, Appu says that the team plans to take advantage of the controlled environment. “The project was conceptualised two years ago and we rolled it out now because everything fell into place. We are confident of pulling it off within the limitations because the movie has several scenes that need such a milieu,” he says.

Talking about the crew, he points out that it is among the many projects he had finalised with the film’s writer and scenarist, Sanjeev S. Although they had finalised three scripts earlier, the films didn’t materialise. The soundscape will be a highlight. “There are certain aspects in the movie that has to be heard as well,” he adds. Appu’s cousin, Abhishek S Bhattathiri, a supervising sound editor in many Bollywood films, is making his debut in Malayalam as a sound designer with Nizhal.

Appu is also editing the film with Arunlal SP, his classmate. “Having edited several projects, I tend to become mechanical and visualise the end product even when the shoot is on. So it was important to have another point of view. Arun has been into visual effects and he will definitely bring something fresh to the editing table since he is new to this,” Appu says.

172,2020/10/20,Not all procedures followed by police need to have statutory backing: HC,"Those in vogue for a long time would fossilize into accepted practice if they aren’t illegal, says judge

A procedure or practice followed by the police need not be jettisoned on the ground of not being backed by a statute if it had been in vogue for a long time and if it does not violate any law, the Madras High Court has said.

Justice P.N. Prakash said so while rejecting the argument of an accused that the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) does not permit investigating agencies to file alteration memos before courts for clubbing two cases into one.

“That there is no provision in Cr.P.C., for filing alteration memo is indeed true but it is a procedure adopted by the investigating agencies from time immemorial in Tamil Nadu and it had fossilized into an accepted practice,” the judge said.

He pointed out that when a person gets attacked brutally, the police register a First Information Report (FIR) under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of Indian Penal Code and forward the document to the jurisdictional judicial magistrate.

However, if the injured dies subsequently, the case would get altered to Section 302 (murder) of IPC and an alteration memo would be forwarded to the magistrate. Such a memo would not amount to amending the FIR because the latter could not be amended after registration.

An intimation

“Filing of an alteration memo is an intimation to the court that the investigating officer is now investigating a case of murder and not attempt to murder. It is merely an information provided to the court about the route taken by the investigating agency.

“It does not require the formal nod of any court because investigation completely falls within the domain of the investigating agency, of course to be generally monitored by the court concerned and nothing beyond that,” Justice Prakash added.

As far as the present case before the court was concerned, he said the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had reportedly received a call from a courier firm in Tiruppur on June 25, 2019 complaining about the suspicious nature of a consignment bound for Saudi Arabia.

The NCB sleuths seized the package from the courier office and found that the consignor was the petitioner R. Westly of Ambasamudram in Tirunelveli district and the consignee was Basimah Hadi Alyami at Al Khobar in Saudi Arabia.

On opening the package, they found that it contained 500 Tramadol tablets, a pain killer that had been declared as a psychotropic substance on April 26, 2018 and brought under the ambit of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act of 1985.

On June 26, 2019, the sleuths seized another consignment of 500 tablets sent by the petitioner to Mishal Yousu in Saudi Arabia. Though two separate cases were registered regarding the seizures, an alteration memo was filed to club them together.

A special court for NDPS Act cases in Coimbatore accepted the alteration memo and hence the present criminal revision case.

Opposing the special court’s decision, the petitioner’s counsel N.S. Sivakumar argued that the NDPS Act classifies seizure of psychotropic substances into three categories. The first was ‘small quantity’ of up to five grams for which the maximum punishment was one year of imprisonment or fine or both.

The second was the quantity between 5.1 grams to 249.99 grams for which the accused could be punished with a maximum of 10 years of imprisonment and fine. However, there was no minimum punishment prescribed for dealing with such quantity.

On the other hand, the third category of ‘commercial quantity’ of 250 grams and beyond entails the accused to a minimum punishment of 10 years in prison and it could extend up to 20 years. It would also attract a fine of not less than ₹1 lakh.

Stating that the average weight of each tablet recovered by the NCB from the courier office was 0.4756 grams, the petitioner’s counsel contended that clubbing the two seizures would take the total quantity to 470 grams.

Court’s prerogative

Instead, if the cases related to the two seizures were tried separately, each seizure would weigh only around 235 grams. After recording his submissions, Justice Prakash said it was the prerogative of the trial court to decide whether an accused should face single or multiple trials.

“Today, in practice, what happens is, whatever report/complaint is filed by the investigating agency, courts accept them as they are and conduct trial thereupon,” the judge lamented and said the investigators could not be allowed to take decisions on single or multiple trials.

In so far as the petitioner was concerned, the prosecution would have to prove both the seizures to make them fall under ‘commercial quantity,’ the judge said.

He also sounded a word of caution that the petitioner may not even have known about Tramadol having been suddenly declared a psychotropic substance in April 2018 especially because he had given his correct name and address in the consignment.

“When the NCB called him to their office, he walked straight into the lion’s den. Under the NDPS Act, punishments are stringent and presumptions are loaded against the accused. So, the responsibility is heavy on the trial court to ensure that the innocent does not suffer unjust sentence. The trial court may bear these aspects in mind while trying the accused,” the judge concluded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5m2i2b/article32903952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MADRASHIGHCOURTVG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/not-all-procedures-followed-by-police-need-to-have-statutory-backing-hc/article32903953.ece

176,2020/10/20,‘Constitution does not provide for reservations in appointment of SC judges’,"Law Minister was replying to a demand to ensure social justice and diversity in the appointments

Union Minister for Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad has said the Constitution does not provide for reservations on the basis of caste, class or gender when it comes to appointment of judges to the Supreme Court. He said this while replying to a demand made by DMK MP P. Wilson to ensure social justice and diversity in the appointments.

The MP had, on September 17, made a request to Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu, seeking permission to make a special mention in the House on September 19 regarding a matter of urgent public importance. He had issued a notice to the Secretary General of the Rajya Sabha along with a text of the matter to be mentioned.

‘Disturbing trends’

The notice referred to certain “disturbing trends” in the composition of the Supreme Court and claimed that for the past few years, there had been a decline in representation from all sections of society in the apex court. “There is a diversity deficit in our Supreme Court and is not indicative of the wonderfully diverse and pluralistic society of India.

“Judicial diversity is fundamental to the quality of judging. Many social groups are poorly represented in the apex court. There is lack of women judges and judges from historically oppressed and marginalised sections of society... This may mean their rights are not being properly safeguarded and may eventually lead to violation of such rights,” the MP said.

He also stated that the people of the country were “afraid that a very narrow and homogenous group of judges belonging to certain classes were not necessarily going to reflect the views and values of society as a whole... as the judges would interpret and enforce law based on their own background”.

The MP insisted that the Parliament must step in to ensure social justice and diversity in appointments to the highest court in the country. In a reply dated October 10, the Law Minister had told the MP that the Supreme Court judges were appointed under Article 124 of the Constitution which does not provide for any reservation.

He further said that out of the sanctioned strength of 34 judges, the Supreme Court, now, had a working strength of 30, including two women, three from minority communities and one from a Scheduled Caste.

Mr. Prasad also stated that the Supreme Court judges were being appointed predominantly from among the Chief Justices and judges of the various High Courts. Hence, the Centre had been impressing upon the need to give due consideration to suitable candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, minorities and women while making appointments to the High Courts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/constitution-does-not-provide-for-reservations-in-appointment-of-sc-judges/article32901244.ece
177,2020/10/20,Action to be taken against Vellore shops violating COVID-19 safety regulations,"Officials of the Vellore City Municipal Corporation said they would first create awareness on Standard Operating Procedures, and then impose fines on establishments that did not follow them

With the festival season round the corner, the Vellore City Municipal Corporation is gearing up to monitor big commercial establishments and hotels and take action against those that are violating the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) issued by the State Health Department.

The Health Department, in an order said that a fine of ₹5,000 would be imposed on those violating the SOPs issued for salons and spas, gymnasiums, commercial establishments and other public places.

Those not wearing a face mask in public places will have to pay ₹200. Those spitting in public places and violating distancing norms will have to pay ₹500 as a fine amount.

The Vellore City Municipal Corporation has 60 wards and four zones. “In the last one month we have collected close to ₹3 lakh as fines from shops and establishments for not following SOPs including not wearing masks or not following physical distancing norms. Prior to that too we collected close to ₹3 lakh. Over 75 staff from the Health Department are on the job,” said S. Chitrasena, city health officer, Vellore City Municipal Corporation.

Ms. Chitrasena said that there are 150 big shops and hotels in her area. “During the festival season, there will be a lot of crowds in them. We are first going to create awareness about the SOPs. If they do not follow the regulations, we will impose a fine of ₹5,000 on them,” she added.

Annamalai University has launched an Android-based application to enable students, faculty members and research scholars to look up titles of interest from over 80 publishers, e-books and journals.

The University has extended its remote access E-Resource service, which is disseminated through an online Android platform, MYLOFT (My Library at My Fingertip). Users can now login on the app and search for titles using keywords with the help of a separate user ID and password.

The service through MYLOFT app was launched by University Vice-Chancellor Prof V. Murugesan.

According to Dr. M. Sadik Batcha, Professor and Librarian, Dr. C.P. Ramasamy Aiyar Library, the university spends nearly ₹50 lakh every year to buy e-books, journals and other publications.

However, with students attending online classes due to the COVID-19 necessitated lockdown, they were unable to visit the library to access e-books, library subscribed resources, digital content and journals, he said.

“We developed the application and enabled a remote access platform through which students, research scholars and faculty members can download the e-books and research articles available in the library at the click of a mouse,” he said.

This is a license based system and access is allowed only for students, research scholars and faculty members. A separate user ID will be created for every registered user and the password will be sent on their mail ID. Licenses have been issued for over 3,000 students and research scholars, Mr. Batcha said.

Earlier, students had access to these publications only from the university library and the LAN servers in the campus. Now they can access and download it from anywhere across various platforms.

Though the mobile and web app was ready, the University had to get the approval of 88 publishers for downloading research articles. The library’s books cover a wide range of disciplines including humanities, engineering, medicine and social sciences.

The remote access service is seeing an exponential increase in downloads since its launch last week. The daily logins have touched 1,000 while over 500 have used it for reference.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/c3fjby/article32899046.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20OCTTH--Cuddalorejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/annamalai-universitys-library-is-now-just-a-click-away-for-students/article32899049.ece
180,2020/10/20,HR&CE Department restrained from using funds from rich temples to renovate village shrines,"HC says a satisfactory explanation has not be furnished in counter affidavit

The Madras High Court has restrained the State government and the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department from forcing 20 financially stable temples to spare ₹10 crore from their surplus funds for the renovation of 1,000 village temples spread across the State.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha made absolute an interim order of status quo granted by another Bench, led by Justice M.M. Sundresh, on July 27. The interim order was granted following a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by Rangarajan Narasimhan of Srirangam.

Subsequently, when the case was listed along with a batch of other similar cases filed by T.R. Ramesh of the Indic Collective Trust and others, the Bench led by Justice Sathyanarayanan took serious note of the petitioners’ complaints that many temple lands in the State had been sold for throwaway prices.

“Though it is submitted by the learned Government Advocate (HR&CE) that a counter affidavit has been filed, this court is of the considered view that a satisfactory explanation has not been put forth,” the Division Bench observed, and stated that a proper explanation should be provided by December 1.

The judges also warned that they would have no other option but to direct the HR&CE Department Secretary and Commissioner to personally assist the court whenever the hearing of the batch of cases take place, and if the counsel representing the department does not provide a satisfactory explanation.

In his affidavit, Mr. Narasimhan had pointed out that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had made an announcement in the Legislative Assembly on March 24 for providing ₹10 crore to renovate 1,000 financially unstable village temples under the control of the HR&CE Department.

Subsequently, the HR&CE Commissioner forwarded a proposal to the government to pool in the money from surplus funds of financially stable temples. The proposal was accepted and a Government Order was issued on May 15. It was followed by the HR&CE Commissioner’s June 26 proceedings for using about ₹25 lakh to 1 crore from the surplus funds of 20 temples.

Questioning such a directive issued by the HR&CE Commissioner, the petitioner said the HR&CE Act empowered the Department to only have supervisory control over the temples which should otherwise be managed by their individual board of trustees. Any decision on parting with surplus funds should emanate from the temple management, he said.

Other litigants before the court accused the HR&CE Department of mismanaging the properties and funds of various temples in the State.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hrce-department-restrained-from-using-funds-from-rich-temples-to-renovate-village-shrines/article32896490.ece

Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar on Monday said several constituents of the DMK-led coalition may cross over to the camp led by the ruling AIADMK.

“The DMK is like an automobile that has suffered a breakdown and is yet to resume functioning. We are confident that not only our current allies but also many other parties would be keen on joining us,” the Minister told reporters when asked whether the AIADMK would go it alone in the upcoming Assembly poll.

Were any of the DMK’s allies in touch with the AIADMK? To this, Mr. Jayakumar said he would not be able to reveal anything now. “Everything will be known at the time of the election,” he added.

When asked about PMK leader Dheeran’s statement that his party would seek a share in power to join any coalition for the Assembly poll, the Minister said the remark may have been made to keep members of the PMK in “good humour” and would have no reflection on the alliance with the AIADMK.

The upcoming Assembly election in the State will be a “big war” to protect the rights of Tamils, DMK president M.K. Stalin said on Monday.

“It is not just about ushering in a change in the State. The election is a war to protect the education and employment rights of Tamils,” Mr. Stalin said while exhorting party cadre to work towards victory.

Addressing party cadre in Tiruchi district through videoconference during the ‘Mupperum Vizha’, Mr. Stalin said Tamil Nadu was stuck in a mire due to the AIADMK government headed by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami. “The sooner we capture power in the State, the sooner we will be in a position to protect the rights of the State,” he said.

The State had lost its rights in the sphere of education due to the national education policy and NEET. In the farm sector too, the rights of farmers had been usurped by the new laws. Minorities could lose citizenship due to the Citizenship Amendment Act, he alleged.

There was also a move to usurp Anna University. Candidates from other States were being recruited into various Central government departments and organisations in the State, and applications of candidates from Tamil Nadu were being rejected in a well-planned manner, he claimed.

Attempts were being made to thwart social justice to check the entry of students belonging to SC, ST, backward and most backward communities into higher educational institutions. “The responsibility of preventing such moves lies on the shoulders of the DMK,” Mr. Stalin said.

186,2020/10/20,Home care of patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms gains traction,"They have round-the-clock access to treatment through tele-consultation

Home-based care of persons with mild symptoms of COVID-19 is slowly gaining momentum in Tamil Nadu. While it comes at a cost, doctors say treating patients at home has its benefits, and very few of them ultimately require hospital admission.

Many patients with mild symptoms choose to stay at home or are advised home isolation based on their vital parameters. For such patients, home-based care helps in more than one way — it offers round-the-clock access to healthcare through tele-consultation and regular monitoring, along with the required support if hospitalisation is needed, doctors say.

The State government’s ‘Amma Home COVID-19 Care Kit’ has covered 370 patients so far. Patients who have tested positive and who have been advised home isolation and anyone with suspected symptoms but with a RT-PCR negative result are eligible for the home care scheme.

“We have covered patients across Tamil Nadu, and also a few of them in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Assam. We send the home care kits through courier to other States,” V. Anand Kumar, nodal officer of Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Specialty Hospital. The scheme is managed by a 35-member team of the master health check-up scheme of this hospital.

Of the 370 patients, 55 were taken to the nearest government hospital for CT scan, while 48 persons received specialist consultation for diabetes, cardiology and neurology. “Thirteen of them showed early signs of disease progression and were saved by timely admission to government hospitals. Some of them progressed from earlier normal CT scan to mild/moderate lung involvement and showed early signs of dip in oxygen saturation. We have successfully treated 92 patients with co-morbidities and six children who were in home isolation,” he said. He added that patients can call 7338835555 to enrol in the scheme.

Koushik Muthu Raja M., associate professor and consultant, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre, said, “We do a risk analysis of patients who test positive. A panel of investigations is done. This includes chest X-ray and blood parameters such as complete blood count, blood sugar and clotting factors and inflammatory markers. If the parameters are within the normal limit, we recommend home care for 14 days. They will have to sign a consent form, undertaking to stay in isolation as per the rule of the government and call up doctors/hospitals in case of any issue.”

Of the 225 patients covered under home care, only three to four required hospital admission. “Except for these persons, all of them were managed at home. One of the biggest advantages is that beds in hospitals need not be occupied unnecessarily and could be reserved for patients with severe infection. The availability of beds will definitely improve as patients with mild disease do not need hospitalisation,” Dr. Koushik Muthu Raja said.

Financial burden also comes down by 70%-80% for these patients, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wkcd6/article32896606.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20-Key-featurescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/home-care-of-patients-with-mild-covid-19-symptoms-gains-traction/article32896607.ece
187,2020/10/20,PIL plea against fine for flouting safety norms,"Government gazette notification issued on September 4 challenged

A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court, challenging a government gazette notification issued on September 4 for the collection of fines ranging from ₹200 to ₹5,000 for violation of quarantine measures, failure to wear masks, spitting in public places, non-adherence to distancing norms and failure to follow standard operating procedures in salons, spas and gymnasiums to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The case is expected to be listed before a Division Bench of Justices V. Parthiban and G.R. Swaminathan on Thursday. According to the petitioner R. Muthukrishnan, 77, of Ramapuram here, the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act, 1939, a colonial law, as it stood originally, did not authorise government officials to insist upon wearing of masks in public places, following physical distance norms and adhering to standard operating procedures.

It was only after the outbreak of the pandemic the government promulgated an ordinance on September 4 and amended Section 76(2) of the Act. The amendment empowered the Collectors, health officers and police officials to enforce wearing of masks, maintenance of physical distance and adherence to standard operating procedures. On the same day, the gazette notification was also issued listing the fine amount that could be imposed for violation of these requirements.

The notification stated that those who do not wear masks in public places would be fined ₹200 and those who do not follow quarantine measures, spit in public places and violate physical distance norms would be fined ₹500. Violation of standard operating procedures in salons, spas, gymnasiums and such other places would attract a fine of ₹5,000. For non-adherence to containment zone guidelines, individuals would have to cough up ₹500 and commercial establishments should pay ₹5,000.

Legal grounds

Attacking the gazette notification on legal grounds, the petitioner said Section 76(2) of the Act only empowers government officials to issue standard operating procedures and ensure wearing of masks and maintenance of physical distancing norms to control the spread of notified diseases. Nowhere does it declare non- adherence by individuals an offence. Yet, the notification had considered the tasks listed under the Section as offences and declared them compoundable.

He also claimed that the notification, which was in the nature of a subordinate legislation, had been issued by the Health Secretary and not by the Governor, though it claims the latter had exercised his rule-making power under Section 138A of the Act and permitted the executive authorities to compound the offences. “The notification is in the nature of an executive order,” the petitioner said, urging the court to quash it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pil-plea-against-fine-for-flouting-safety-norms/article32896605.ece

189,2020/10/20,Health workers to be screened for NCDs,"Testing will be conducted till Oct. 23

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar on Monday launched the ‘Fit Health Workers Campaign 2020’ at the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital.

Under the initiative, all healthcare workers would be screened for non- communicable diseases (NCDs).

The Minister said testing for NCDs was mandatory for every healthcare worker at the hospital. Each worker should be fit to treat a patient, he said. He said the screening of all healthcare workers in the public healthcare system for common NCDs in rural and urban areas would be conducted across the State till October 23.

Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan stressed the need for adequate glycemic control, lifestyle modification, reduction in stress and avoiding of junk food.

All healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, paramedical personnel and administrative staff, would undergo a complete check-up for NCDs. This would include blood tests, chest X-ray, ECG, ultrasound as well as mammogram and pap smear for women health workers. At Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, around 4,500 staff members would be screened. The focus would be on diabetes and hypertension, while women would be screened for breast cancer and cervical cancer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/health-workers-to-be-screened-for-ncds/article32896600.ece
190,2020/10/20,IIT-M students can choose up to 50% of their electives,"Students can also opt for a semester in a foreign university

Students joining the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Madras will have the flexibility of choosing up to 50% of their electives from any of its 16 departments. Students can also opt for a semester-long study in a foreign university.

Normally, students have to take 16 electives, of which they can choose eight from any department they wish or from any other approved institution of their choice.

Students can earn 72 credits by pursuing courses such as the ‘History of India’, Psychology, Economics, Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning.

A student who chooses four courses in a contiguous area will receive a minor in that field. The institute’s website has the details of the curriculum and the syllabi.

V. Jagadeesh Kumar, Dean (Academic Courses), said, “If a student interested in building things builds a robot, the student can avail himself of credits for the same. Students can earn as much as 36 credits in all departments. Certain departments are offering up to 48 credits for such activities”.

However, these are not part of a class but are done for fun. “If it clicks, it can be converted to credits under the IIT-Madras system,” he said.

Since the institute had signed agreements with many foreign universities, including in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, students would also have the flexibility of doing an entire semester in any of these universities.

Transferred to curriculum

The courses that the students pursue in these foreign universities would be transferred to their curriculum in the institute, he said.

A candidate who wants to pursue an MBA, apart from a B. Tech, may do so by spending an additional year and receive a degree in both programmes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/iit-m-students-can-choose-up-to-50-of-their-electives/article32896597.ece
191,2020/10/20,TNPSC rejects claim of equivalence of qualification,"Candidate moves Tamil Nadu Information Commission

After the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) rejected an applicant on the grounds that M.A. (Criminology) was not equivalent to M.Sc. (Criminology & Criminal Justice Science), the candidate has moved the Tamil Nadu Information Commission for a clarification from the University of Madras.

The case arises out of a petition filed by S. Nishanthi of Chennai under the Right to Information Act on when the university had changed the nomenclature of M.A. (Criminology) to M.A. (Criminology & Criminal Justice Administration), and then to M.Sc. (Criminology & Criminal Justice Science), and the steps taken by the authorities to get the “equivalence of qualification” from the State government. The petitioner said the TNPSC had rejected her candidature for a post stating that M.Sc. (Criminology & Criminal Justice Science) was not equivalent to M.A. (Criminology). She filed an appeal before the Tamil Nadu Information Commission. In keeping with the COVID-19 protocol, State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj held an enquiry on the phone with the petitioner and the Public Information Officer (PIO)/Assistant Registrar. The PIO stated that both courses were not equivalent since the syllabi were different. However, the candidate could meet the Head of the Department of Criminology and get more clarity, he said.

When contacted, M. Srinivasan, Head of the Department of Criminology, Madras University, said M.A. (Criminology) was named M.A. (Criminology & Criminal Justice Administration) two decades ago. In 2015, the name was changed to M.Sc. (Criminology & Criminal Justice Science) in tune with the pattern of education followed by internationally acclaimed institutions.

According to P. Madhava Soma Sundaram, Head, Department of Criminology & Criminal Justice, Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli, M.Sc (Criminology & Criminal Justice) had more content than what is prescribed for M.A (Criminology) thereby enriching the student with more knowledge in the subject.

“We have analysed both the courses and clearly stated before the committee more than a year ago that they can be treated as equivalent. Subjects like cyber crimes/laws, forensic medicine etc have been included in the new course…we have added more than what is required in M.Sc as compared to M.A (Criminology),” Prof. Sundaram said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a9hb5p/article32658207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADRASUNI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tnpsc-rejects-claim-of-equivalence-of-qualification/article32896596.ece
192,2020/10/20,Decks cleared for State govt. to frame rules on contract farming,"Centre makes public rules for Farm Act

The Central government’s notification of rules for the law on contract farming — Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act — has paved the way for the State government to finalise its set of rules early.

Through a gazette notification dated October 16, the Centre made public its rules for the Act. The website of the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare has published the rules, which have only laid down a framework for dispute resolution.

Conciliation board, sub-divisional authority and District Collector concerned form the layers of the dispute resolution mechanism.

According to Section 23 of the Act, State governments too are empowered to frame rules on matters such as the mode and manner of payment to farmers; constitution, composition, powers and functions of registration authority; the procedure for registration and any other matter.

The feature of mode and manner of payment to the farmers can address the issue of the agriculturists getting a fair price for their produce as sections of the farmers and activists have expressed concern over the absence of reference in the law to the minimum support price (MSP).",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/decks-cleared-for-state-govt-to-frame-rules-on-contract-farming/article32896595.ece

194,2020/10/20,Fly ash from power station leaks into Ennore creek,"Tangedco engineers begin repair works after video appears on social media

In yet another instance of fly ash leaking from the North Chennai Thermal Power Station at Ennore, the video of a pipeline dumping large amounts of fly ash into Kosasthalaiyar river was revealed on social media on Monday.

A video of the leak was captured by environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman on Monday morning. “This is probably the second time I am seeing this sort of a big leak. The pipeline was leaking fly ash for more than one-and-a-half hours. On one side, removal of fly ash is happening. On the other hand, these types of leaks continue,” he said

Mr. Jayaraman said the fly ash spill on Monday was directly into Kosasthalaiyar river. “The fly ash that is being cleared on one side is dumped nearby. When it rains, this will also drain into the river,” he added.

Locals say the leaks were a regular feature at the creek and pipeline bursts were common.

In July, the Water Resources Department had begun work on dredging the backwaters of the Ennore creek.

Rare occurrence

A senior official of Tangedco, confirming a burst in the pipeline which caused the leakage of fly ash, said engineers were involved in the repair operation throughout the day.

He said such kinds of pipeline cracks, which evacuate the fly ash to the fly ash pond, were rare occurrences, and all steps were being taken to prevent leakage in the pipelines.

The Tangedco official said work was in progress for replacing the old pipes with new ones, and it would be completed by the end of this year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/drlfst/article32896385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THGASLEAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fly-ash-from-power-station-leaks-into-ennore-creek/article32896386.ece

198,2020/10/20,Construction of new secretariat complex receives only two bids,"Financial bids to be opened on Friday

As expected, only two major infrastructure development companies have submitted their bids for the construction of the new integrated secretariat complex on the last day of submission of tenders.

The Roads and Buildings department received tenders from construction majors L&T and Shapoorji Pallonji at the end of the deadline on Tuesday. The technical bids will be evaluated and the finance bids of the qualified bidders would be opened on October 23.

“We will evaluate the technical bids and open financial bids on October 23,” a senior official told The Hindu.

The department had to reschedule the tender process more than once because of technicalities as well as the floods that threw life out of gear in the State, especially the GHMC area.

The tenders were initially invited for the construction of the new integrated complex with an estimated built up area of six lakh square feet area after demolition of the old secretariat complex. The initial design submitted by architects, Oscar and Ponni Architects, however, underwent changes with inclusion of additional facilities like construction of buildings for accommodating security personnel and personal assistants of Ministers and other senior officials.

The estimate for the complex subsequently escalated from the initial estimate of ₹ 400 crore that had been accepted by the State Cabinet to ₹ 500 crore. But the inclusion of new elements like providing parking spaces, maintaining greenery (covering at least 60 % of the close to 28 acres) resulted in the enhancement of the costs. The estimated cost of the entire project is expected to be around ₹ 600 crore as the new complex is expected to be one of its kind in the country in terms of administrative as well as online access.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/construction-of-new-secretariat-complex-receives-only-two-bids/article32903332.ece
199,2020/10/20,Centre urged to scrutinize ‘designs’ of TS projects: BJP,"‘Faulty’ designs of irrigation projects causing immense loss, says Bandi Sanjay

Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Tuesday urged Union Minister for Water Resources (Jal Shakti) Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to send a technical team to inquire into the recent flooding of the Kalwakurthy pump house allegedly due to the blasting works in the “wrongly” designed underground pump house of Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrgation Scheme (PRLIS) nearby.

In a communication to the Minister, a copy of which was released to the media, the BJP leader pointed out that there have been a series of “technical failures’ in the irrigation projects in TS resulting in loss of human lives and to the public exchequer. Hence, there was a need for a thorough technical scrutiny into all irrigation projects as “faulty design” is causing financial loss of thousands of crores plus water to lakhs of acres for irrigation and drinking water to lakhs of people are completely at stake.

Mr. Sanjay Kumar claimed that the pump house, motors and other installations/equipment of KLIS are completely submerged as a result of cracks developed due to the blast works being done for PRLIS. While KLIS is an existing project, PRLIS is new project under construction. An government expert committee has given a report stating that the proposed PRLIS underground pump house at 300 meters on the left side of the existing KLIS pump house is not “technically and financially feasible” and suggested for an open cut pumping station at 900 meters on the right side of KLIS, he said.

However, the committee report was ignored and the work on the underground pump house was sanctioned resulting in the present mishap to the KLIS pump house due to “faulty design and gross negligence” of technical parameters by the TRS government, he charged.

The Karimnagar MP claimed several irrigation projects are being taken up in TS with “faulty” designs and not adhering to the technical norms. Detailed project reports have not been submitted to the Krishna River Management and Godavari River Management Boards and no required statutory clearances were obtained from Central government.

He listed out the collapse of an under construction tunnel of the Kaleswaram project in 2017 which led to death of seven workers, leakages of Midmanair project and Kondapochammasagar reservoir, major fire mishap in Srisailam dam (left bank power house) which killed nine people, including five engineers, as examples of the government’s ineptitude.

Therefore, the Centre should insist on submission of DPRs of all projects to look into the “faulty” designs and ensure statutory clearances are taken to save lives, public money and protect legitimate interests of the people, added Mr. Sanjay Kumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/centre-urged-to-scrutinize-designs-of-ts-projects-bjp/article32903301.ece
200,2020/10/20,Woman voters hold the key in Dubbak,"Voters in Dubbak mandal outnumber voters in other mandals

The outcome of the Dubbak bye-election will be decided by the women voters and those in Dubbak mandal limits. They outnumber voters in other mandals.

The assembly constituency has a total of 1,98,807 voters out of which 51 are service voters. Of the remaining 1,98,756 voters, Dubbak mandal alone accounts for 55,208 voters, which makes it the key area for campaigning for all political parties. The other mandals include Mirdoddi (31,762 voters), Toguta (26,751), Daultabad (23,032), Raipol (20,513), Chegunta (32,829), Narsingi (8,215) and Gajwel (446).

The constituency has 1,00,778 female voters while the male voters number 97,978.

With Dubbak mandal having more than one fourth of total votes, the political parties are concentrating on both these factors.

TRS candidate S. Sujatha has been campaigning by mingling with the women. She is being accompanied by MLA M. Padma Devender Reddy and former minister V. Sunitha Lakshma Reddy. They are using Batukamma festival as an opportunity to meet the women and participating in the programmes thereby impressing them.

The TRS has also planned to organise a grand meeting at Dubbak on Wednesday with about 10,000 women. Finance Minister T.

201,2020/10/20,Recent floods continue to test Musi Project,"Gates have been replaced but maintenance has been poor, admit officials

Musi project in Nalgonda continues to face one of the biggest tests of flood in its 57 years of service, as torrential rain in upstream Hyderabad threaten to continue heavy inflows.

The project which can hold 4.46 tmc ft water at full reservoir level (FRL) of 645 feet and provide irrigation to 30,000 acres in its command area, has set new records this season.

Not only has the impounded water crossed the FRL by up to three feet, but also the outflow, on October 14 alone, was an unprecedented 16 tmc ft, 3.58 times the project’s gross capacity. The total discharge for two successive days was 25 tmc ft, say officials.

By contrast, the total discharge from the project to downstream between June and October this year was 38 tmc ft.

The recent bout of heavy rains is is also one of the rarest times when officials breached a section of the dam to let out up to 25,000 cusecs of water. The dam was breached near the abutting Ratnapuram village in “an emergency move”.

According to records at the project office, the 1983 flood saw the maximum inflows of about 2.28 lakh cusecs, in comparison the project received nearly 2.5 lakh cusecs in the past few days. The maximum flood capacity of the project is 4 lakh cusecs. In 2005 and 2013, water levels rose up to the embankment, however, related figures of inflows and outflows were unavailable.

Is the current swelling flood a threat to the dam? District Minister and Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy recently dismissed the question of a threat and said: “There is no danger to Musi or the ayacut. This is an unprecedented flood, from Hyderabad and Bikkeru Vagu, receiving more than 2 lakh cusecs. We breached a section of the dam and officials are monitoring the levels.”

However, the project officials said: “The question of Musi dam safety is dependent on the gates and their operation and their capacity to withstand the flows and not about the volume of flood received and discharged. The structure is fine.”

Maintenance of the project was in question in October 2019, when a regulatory gate got washed away, and more than 4 tmc ft impounded water, at 643 feet, drained in a few days. This brought into focus the maintenance as all the gates had been replaced with new ones at an estimated cost of ₹18 crore in 2015. Thankfully, subsequent bountiful rains filled the reservoir, which not only saved face for the administration but also served the needs of the farmers in the ayacut.

The recent rains too tested the maintenance of the project. On October 14, when 13 gates (of the total 12 crest gates and eight regulatory gates) were operated to a height of 10 feet, crest gate no. 9 failed to open as its counterweight had snapped in August this year. Fortunately, the 35-ton beam did not break the gate, but fell away. The gate is not working well, the officials agree.

On Tuesday, when this correspondent visited the site, workers and welders were busy patching up the foot of regulatory gate no. 2. Other gates also show leakages, or throw up problems at closing and opening, officials said.

It is not just the gates, the nearly six-decade-old dam is also visibly old, with the meagre staff that is ready for retirement, and the decrepit stairs and cracked structures. The border railings of the earth dam and the gate columns, braced with sticks and wires like bandages, welcome officials and visitors alike.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/iu3262/article32902840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21MUSIGATES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/recent-floods-continue-to-test-musi-project/article32902841.ece

Set up in 2004 by a non-governmental organisation, the institution has won accolades for its consistent services to mentally retarded girls with compassion. It opened a vocational training centre in January this year to impart vocational training to the inmates with a view to fostering their overall well-being.

The centre has carved out a niche for itself in a short span with the organisers taking keen interest to make utility items such as paper plates and glasses as well as sanitary pads. The centre is also helping women from poor families of the mandal learn the vocational skills and tread the path of financial self-reliance.

As many as 68 mentally retarded girls from both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are presently sheltered in the home.

""We have been consistently providing special education, various therapies to our inmates to improve their speech and language skills besides promote their overall well-being,"" said Sister Alphie, the in-charge of the home, who hails from Kerala.

Bishop Maipan Paul of Khammam RCM Church and other philanthropists are constantly supporting us in our endeavour, she said.

The vocational training centre has made the home self-sufficient in terms of meeting the requirement of utility items such as sanitary napkins, she remarked, adding that several poor women from neighbouring villages are also actively involved in making utility items at the centre. ""We are planning to take orders for supply of items like paper plates,"" she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bid-to-promote-craft-skills-among-mentally-disabled/article32902810.ece

204,2020/10/20,‘Our fight is for self-esteem of people of Telangana’,"Kodandaram inaugurates TJS district office

The upcoming election to the Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda Graduates’ Constituency in the Legislative Council is a fight between the ‘autocratic regime’ at the helm bent upon muzzling the voices of dissent and the democratic forces striving for realisation of the aspirations of the separate Telangana movement, said Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) president M. Kodandaram.

Mr. Kodandaram, who spearheaded the separate Telangana struggle as the chairman of the Telangana JAC during the Statehood movement, is all set to contest the forthcoming MLC election from the Graduates Constituency slated for early next year. He inaugurated the TJS district office here on Tuesday.

He addressed a preparatory meeting attended by members of various mass organisations and the CPI (ML-New Democracy), who extended their support to his candidature.

Later, talking to reporters Mr. Kodandaram said the upcoming election is a platform to continue the struggle for restoration of democratic values in Telangana and socio-economic development of the State.

“The forthcoming hustings will serve as a forum to fight against dictatorial tendencies of the rulers and protect the self-esteem of people of Telangana,” he said.

Our struggle is aimed at achieving the basic three objectives of the separate Telangana movement — Neeru, Nidhulu and Niyamakalu (water, funds and jobs), he added.

The TRS regime has failed to deliver its promises to unemployed youth on provision of jobs, government employees on the implementation of the PRC and a plethora of other assurances in the last six years, he charged.

He accused the State government of remaining insensitive to the plight of teachers and lecturers of private educational institutions, daily wage earners and others hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic-induced crisis.

“The persons at the helm in the State unleashed unethical practices such as encouraging defections from the Opposition parties, misusing money and power in all elections held in Telangana so far,” he flayed, alleging that the SLBC tunnel and various other projects remained incomplete due to the apathy of the present dispensation in the State.

205,2020/10/20,Telangana temple wall narrates tale of a millenia-old Swayamvaram,"Sculptural panel of the ‘Swayamvaram’ scene of a Kalyani Chalukya prince discovered

The portrayal of ‘Swayamvaram’ of a royal couple of Kalyani Chalukya dynasty, never documented so far, has come to light with the discovery of a sculptural panel at the Trikuta Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Nellikuduru village of Mahabubabad district.

This chance finding of the sculpture reflects the sociological practices of marriage by the members of the royal families of yore.

Explaining the architectural significance of the pre-Kakatiya period — late 11th century A.D. — shrine former superintending archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India, Chennai, D. Kanna Babu said that the temple stands on a well-built ‘jagati’ platform of about three feet height.

In the main shrine Sri Ranganatha is portrayed in a reclining posture, the southern sub-temple has Ramanujacharya and the northern sub-temple Goddess. A vestibule is positioned before the abode of the presiding deity and the two on either side having only sanctums.

The 12th Century Sri Ranganathaswamy Trikuta temple at Nellikuduru in Mahabubabad district.

The most puzzling aspect of the temple is its decorative walls with sculptural representations. Elaborating on the carved figures, he said that the panel on the northern wall portrays the marriage scene or ‘Swayamvaram’ of a royal couple. The panel contains upper and lower registers.

“It is exciting to note that the upper register exhibiting a royal prince, in elegant attire, stood on its right side and he was approached by a princess, wearing a highly fashioned apparel tied with an ornamental waistband, and offering him a flower bouquet and he received it,” Mr. Babu said.

An attendant is also seen behind her with some bunch of flowers. In another panel, the prince is seen holding her right hand with his left hand. “This sculptural scene demonstrates the Swayamvaram feature and reflects the noblemen’s style of life in contemporary society,” he said.

Since the temple bears the architectural features of Kalyani Chalukyas, it is reasonable to presume that the it was built by a subordinate regional chieftain of sovereign Chalukya king when they were overlords of these provinces before the advent of Kakatiyas of Anumakonda.

Mr. Babu said that the prince in the sculptural panel might be Kumara Tailapa, the younger brother of Bhulokamalla and son of Vikramaditya IV. His father made him chief of Kandurunadu province and the bride may be the daughter of a nobleman family of Nellikuduru.

“The Swayamvaram might have taken place at this temple complex and the scene is carved on walls by an unknown sculptor of that time. Unfortunately this episode was not mentioned in any of the contemporary literary records,” he said.

According to him, the lower register of the panel exhibiting medallions of two swimming fishes and wrestlers and two elephants planting a mango tree indicates a happy sign of marriage.

Dwelling on the architectural significance of the temple, he said that there is a common ‘mukha mandapa’ hall and entry is through doorways at the east. The stepped pyramidal superstructure that heads this triple shrine is built with brick and lime.

The shrine is also noteworthy for its imposing Kalyana mandapam in the front.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/14sqez/article32902196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy18Sculptural-pane,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/temple-wall-narrates-tale-of-a-millenia-old-swayamvaram/article32902198.ece
206,2020/10/20,Environmental clearance to Kaleshwaram given in violation of law: NGT,"Tribunal directs Centre to appoint expert panel on remedial measures

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has held that environmental clearance (EC) to Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP) was granted ex post facto, after completion of substantial work, by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) “in violation of law”.

It has also observed that accountability needs to be fixed and remedial measures be taken. For that purpose, it has directed the MoEF&CC to constitute a seven-member expert committee preferably out of expert appraisal committee (EAC) members with relevant sectorial expertise to go into the matter in light of the observations in the present case.

In the judgment posted on its website on Tuesday in a petition filed by one Md. Hayath Udin, a resident of Siddipet district, who is also a farmer affected directly by the project, the Principal Bench of NGT asked the Ministry to constitute the expert committee within a month and it may complete its exercise within six months thereafter shouldering the responsibility of monitoring the panel work to the Secretary of MOEF&CC.

The petitioner moved the NGT with a contention declare the EC granted to KLIP as invalid since substantial work was done by the State Government, project proponent, prior to filing application with the Ministry for clearance.

“We find that in spite of finding illegality in granting EC, it is neither possible nor desirable to undo what has happened, but accountability needs to be fixed and remedial measures taken,” the Bench comprising Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, Judicial Member Justice S.P. Wangdi and Expert Member Dr. Nagin Nanda said their judgement.

The NGT Principal Bench suggested that the expert committee could assess the extent of damage caused in going ahead with the project without EC – the period from 2008 to 2017 — and identify the necessary restoration measures. Further, it could look into relief and rehabilitation measures adopted and required to be further adopted, examine effective implementation of environmental management plan (EMP) submitted by the project proponent as also compliance of EC conditions.

“Any affected party will be at liberty to make representation to the MoEF&CC within three weeks along with suggestions and grievances, which may be taken into the account by the expert committee”, the NGT said in its judgement. It has further asked MoEF&CC to consider measures to prevent recurrence of such violations where EC is sought ex post facto.

It is particularly required when the projects are multi-purpose and part of it requires EC, so that such requirement is not defeated on specious plea that the project was partly not covered by the schedule Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification as has happened in the present case, the NGT observed. Instead of confining consideration merely to documentary support, a mechanism is required to be evolved and followed whereby physical verification of material particulars can be undertaken, wherever necessary, it suggested.

In the matter of expansion of the project scope to draw 3 tmc ft of water a day from the present 2 tmc ft, the NGT observed that directions of the Centre are binding on the State unless challenged and set aside.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ty2er6/article32899526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KALESHWARARMKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kaleshwaram-irrigation-project-got-environmental-clearance-ex-post-facto-in-violation-of-law-ngt/article32899527.ece

208,2020/10/20,Goethe Zentrum's 'Three for 30' makes a case for peace and harmony through a virtual photo exhibition,"Ten photographers showcase diverse and heartwarming frames that capture unity in this virtual exhibition

A photograph by Vijay Jodha captures the happy, smiling faces of school students trying to spot their village on a globe.

The village is in Gurez Valley of Kashmir, near the LoC. Observing the cheer among the students in this tumultuous region, Jodha knew it was a special moment. This and several other images by 10 photographers are featured in the virtual exhibition Three for 30, curated by Goethe Zentrum, Hyderabad. The exhibition commemorates 30 years of German Unity Day (October 3) and doffs its hat to the Gandhian principle of non-violence with its theme of peace, harmony and unity.

Jodha recalls his visit to the Valley, “I was travelling with Honeybee Network which supports innovators at the grassroots; the organisation also encourages school students to come up with new ideas and gifts those who come up with something innovative. A globe was gifted to these students and they were thrilled, trying to identify Kashmir and their village.”

Three for 30 features three images by each of the 10 photographers. Amita Talwar delves into her extensive travels to showcase a candid image of two young monks sharing a fun moment, and a devotee finding peace with a sacred thread tied around the wrist.

The photographers’ impressions on non-violence, unity and harmony are diverse. Harpal Singh who has reported extensively on life in Telangana, captures a group of men cycling on the highway and others perched on trucks on a long journey home. Samar Jodha underlines the idea of unity through outstretched arms of a bunch of school children. Namrata Rupani documents the tranquillity at Quli Tub Shahi tombs, and the orange-hued skies of Hyderabad against the Hussain Sagar lake.Saurabh Chatterjee who has been documenting cities and communities, takes viewers into Hyderabad’s Old City where an idol of goddess Durga is being transported for installation in a pandal as burqa-clad women stand by. In this part of Hyderabad, festive celebrations witness an intermingling of communities. In another image, he trains his lens on Hindu and Muslim boys partaking in Holi revelry.

Dev Diwali in Varanasi by Saurabh Chatterjee | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Yet another image from Varanasi shows a Muslim man beaming at the sight of the ghats lit up in rows of diyas. “All these are candid images. The smile you see on the man near the ghats is heartfelt. In Varanasi, people living close to the ghats take up the responsibility of cleaning and decorating the ghats for Dev Diwali. I came across this Muslim gentleman who was pleased with the decorations they had done earlier in the day,” says Chatterjee.

During his repeated visits to Varanasi, Chatterjee observed how different groups spruce up the ghats for the festivities: “Visitors from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh make elaborate floral rangolis on which the diyas are placed.”Dipping into his archives, Sreesailem Pasupuleti was reminded of the time in Vrindavan when he noticed a man walking with his pet rooster: “People worshipping cows is a common sight in Vrindavan and while capturing one such moment, I spotted this man. I followed him and learnt that he has three pet roosters.”

Unity by Sreesailam Pasupuleti | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Elsewhere, in a fishing hamlet in West Bengal, Pasupuleti spotted a group of fishermen hauling a boat towards the shore: “The fishermen work in unison. They head out in groups of 10, on a boat, and the trip lasts anywhere between two to five days. They return with a good catch, which is offloaded, and they haul up the boat together for cleaning and repair work.”

The exhibition includes a few arresting images by photographers Serish Nanisetti, Swarat Ghosh, and Sourav Nandi, and is on view till November 7.

209,2020/10/20,This artist turns discarded wrappers into accordion books,"Mumbai-based Rutuja Mali uses covers of old matchboxes and oregano packets to illustrate relatable scenarios

For most of us, an empty packet of oregano seasoning or a matchbox might be trash but for Artist Rutuja Mali, it is an opportunity to create art. The Mumbai-based artist has been making a series called ‘accordion books’ using such objects and illustrating relatable instances that happen while using them.

Many of us are guilty of looking for a candle using the phone's torchlight or spending a long time beating coffee as guests wait for their serving of a hot cup. Rutuja illustrates the dialogues most of us say during such situations, be it “Torch maar na, candle nahi mil rahi’ or “ Coffee bani?? Phentt rahi hoon”.

“Art need not be exquisite, it is hidden in everyday objects you just need to have the eye for it. I started the series with a matchbox cover that was lying around my house for several years. Initially, I wanted to just make a zine out of it but then I thought the accordion book would be nice as the folds always have an element of surprise in them,” says Rutuja who is professionally an art director.

What started as a one-off thing is now a series of six-illustrations. Her other creations involve the tale of lending erasers that are never returned, or being handed a matchbox when asked for a lighter, or using Eno when one runs out of baking powder.

Some of these artworks come from her own experiences while some are ideas conceived through conversations happening around her. “The Eno accordion book comes from a conversation I had with a friend who mentioned that most of the shops do not have stocks of Eno as people were using it while baking at home during the lockdown. It was only then that I realised baking powder can be replaced by Eno and it was all those social media trends that had made Eno fly off the shelves,” laughs Rutuja. This conversation led to the making of ‘“Baking powder khatam” “Yeh daal”’ illustration where a person is handling a packet of Eno as a replacement to baking powder.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/pdpj0j/article32900262.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/oregano1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/this-mumbai-based-artists-uses-discarded-wrappers-to-create-accordion-books/article32900263.ece

Amid speculations that senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse may join the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in a couple of days, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday said there are talks every day of such kind of muhurat.

Mr. Fadnavis, who is in Osmanabad district to assess losses caused to farmers due to heavy rains, refused to make any further comment on the rumours. Mr. Khadse has been sulking since he was made to resign as a Minister in the then Fadnavis-led BJP government in 2016 on allegations of corruption.

When some reporters claimed there were speculations that Mr. Khadse may take a ‘political decision’ on October 22, Mr. Fadnavis said, “Such kind of muhurat (auspicious time) is being talked about every day and I will not speak on it.”

On Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said Mr. Khadse was earlier the Leader of Opposition and played a huge role in building the BJP in the State. “He would criticise us and we would take note of it,” Mr. Pawar said.

213,2020/10/20,Coronavirus | Court acquits 20 foreign attendees of Tablighi Jamaat event,"Metropolitan Magistrate (Andheri) R.R. Khan acquitted the 20 persons on Monday as the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them.

A Mumbai court has acquitted 20 foreign attendees of a Tablighi Jamaat event who were booked by the city police for allegedly violating prohibitory orders during the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown.

Metropolitan Magistrate (Andheri) R.R. Khan acquitted the 20 persons on Monday as the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them. “There is no iota of evidence with prosecution to show any contravention of order by accused persons beyond all shadow of doubt,” the court observed.

Keeping in view the evidence on record and facts and circumstances of the matter, it is clear that the order in question was neither publicly promulgated nor brought into notice of the accused persons, the court said. The prosecution witnesses clarified that the accused have not violated the lockdown norms and order of the police commissioner, it noted.

Tablighi Jamaat, an island unto itself

The court also said versions of the witnesses were contrary to the documentary evidence on record. “The prosecution has not even carried out preparation of panchanama and never recorded statement of any other independent witness. Thus, there is no legal evidence furnished by prosecution in support of the charge,” it said.

The court further noted that the witnesses were also not found in a position to tell where and how the accused person were residing at the time of the alleged offence.

A case was registered against two groups, each comprising 10 foreign nationals, in April by D.N. Nagar police in Andheri under Indian Penal Code Sections 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 and 270 (acts likely to spread infection of dangerous disease).

They were also charged under provisions of the Foreigners Act, the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act.

A sessions court has already discharged them for offence under IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 304(2) (homicide not amounting to murder).",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lmqm82/article32419330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TABLIGHIJAMAAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-court-acquits-20-foreign-attendees-of-tablighi-jamaat-event/article32901074.ece

The Enforcement Directorate has attached seven more immovable properties and bank balances, amounting to ₹22.42 crore, taking the value of attachment so far to about ₹798 crore in the Iqbal Mirchi case.

15 Dubai-based properties attached in Iqbal Mirchi case

The attached assets include a cinema hall and one hotel in Mumbai, an under-construction hotel, a farmhouse, two bungalows and a 3.5-acre parcel in Maharashtra’s Panchgani.

The ED probe against the international drug dealer, who died in the United Kingdom in 2013, and others had started in September last year.

Five accused persons, including Kapil Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan and Humayun Merchant, have been arrested in the case.

“In December 2019, a chargesheet was also filed before a special court that took its cognisance. Open-ended non-bailable warrants have been issued against Asif Memon, Junaid Memon [sons of Iqbal Mirchi] and Hajra Memon [wife of Iqbal Memon] for their role in the offence of money laundering,” said the agency in a statement.

Last month, the ED had attached 15 Dubai-based properties worth ₹203 crore in the same case, while assets valued ₹573 crore was attached last December.

Iqbal Mirchi was a close associate of Pakistan-based underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. Initial investigations revealed that his family owned 25 properties in the United Kingdom.

215,2020/10/20,Manipur remains partially cut off,"Wobbly bridges along NH 37 that links Manipur to other parts of the country remain unsafe for loaded trucks.

Manipur remains partially cut off from the rest of the country for the second day on Tuesday as the wobbly bridges along NH 37 that links Manipur to other parts of the country remain unsafe for the loaded trucks. The Makru bridge was damaged on Monday midnight.

The landlocked State solely depends on Assam and other States for all items in general, and consumer goods in particular. It has triggered a price hike in Manipur from Tuesday onwards.

A spokesman of construction agencies reportedly told some reporters who reached the damaged bridges that overloaded trucks were responsible for the breakdown of the bridges. However, it has been denied by drivers. The All Manipur Transporter, Drivers and Motor Workers’ Union said that officials deployed along the NH 37 enforced the permitted weights and no truck was allowed to carry goods more than the approved weights.

In bad shape

The drivers said the Makru, the Barak and the Irung bridges have been in bad shape for decades. An activist said that the governments of different parties were busy passing the buck on the company undertaking construction and repairs of roads and bridges.

Traffic is resumed always after a quick fix of repair work. However the highway becomes impassable again soon. The stranded drivers say the construction work of the RCC bridge are “progressing in a snail’s pace”.

Government officials admit that the prices of consumer goods are jacked up whenever two national highways are blocked by landslips and damage to some of the hanging and suspension bridges are reported. Besides agitating sections of people impose national highway blockades to draw the attention of the government to their issues.

Police said a number of goods-laden trucks, buses and private cars were stranded along the NH 37.

State government sources said hectic repairing works on the damaged bridges were on and that the traffic would resume shortly.

Several activists say that at this time while the people are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, the price hike on the pretext of the damaged bridges along the NH 37 comes as the additional burden.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/izhu64/article32900127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THMANIPURTRUCKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/manipur-remains-partially-cut-off/article32900128.ece
216,2020/10/20,Kamal Nath expresses regret over remarks against woman minister,"Rahul Gandhi expresses displeasure, calls the incident ‘unfortunate’.

Facing flak for his “item” jibe against Madhya Pradesh Minister Imarti Devi, State Congress president Kamal Nath has expressed regret over it and asserted that he did not say anything disrespectful.

He claimed the word ‘item’ is used in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, but the BJP tried to “mislead” by making it an issue to divert people’s attention while sensing defeat in the November 3 State bypolls.

“I did not say anything disrespectful. I respect women. If anyone thinks this is disrespectful, then I regret it,” Kamal Nath told reporters on Monday night.

Addressing a poll meeting on Sunday in Gwalior’s Dabra town, where the BJP has fielded Imarti Devi, Kamal Nath said the Congress candidate was a “simple person” unlike his opponent who was an “item“.

Rahul Gandhi’s disapproval

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday disapproved of Mr. Nath’s remark, saying it was ‘unfortunate’

“One cannot treat women with disrespect. Kamalnath ji is from my party. But I don’t like personally that type of language that Kamalnath ji has used. I do not appreciate it. It is unfortunate”, Mr. Gandhi, who is on a three day visit to Kerala, told reporters in Wayand.

State BJP leaders, led by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, on Monday held a protest against Kamal Nath, while the National Commission for Women sought an explanation from the Congress leader for his remark.

Mr. Chouhan also wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, asking her to condemn Mr. Nath’s remarks and remove the former Chief Minister from all party posts.

'Divertion tactic'

Mr. Nath said, “The BJP is trying to divert the attention from real issues after it realised that it is badly losing. I will not let them succeed.”

In a letter to Mr. Chouhan on Monday night, Mr. Nath said, “I didn’t make any disgraceful remarks but you served lies...the word I said has a lot of meanings. Your party is serving lies and misleading by interpreting the word arbitrarily.”

“Under your 15-year-long government, the State remained on top in rape cases, crimes against women, but you remained silent,” the Congress leader claimed.

He also alleged that a Union minister and a cabinet colleague of Mr. Chouhan recently used derogatory terms for women.

“You should have written a letter to your party president informing about the remarks of the Union Minister and cabinet colleague by apologising to the women of the State and observing silent fast,” he said in the letter to CM.

217,2020/10/20,Punjab farm Bills provides for minimum 3 years imprisonment on sale-purchase below MSP,"One Bill seeks to protect the consumers from hoarding and black-marketing of agricultural produce.

The three Bills introduced in the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday to negate the Centre’s agriculture laws provide for imprisonment of not less than three years and fine for the sale-purchase of wheat or paddy under a farming agreement below Minimum Support Price.

This provision has been incorporated in The Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020. According to the Bill, no sale or purchase should done below the MSP and violation of the same shall invite imprisonment of three years and fine. The Bill seeks to amend Sections 1(2), Sections 19 and 20 of the Centre’s Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020. It also proposes to add new Sections that are Section 4, 6 to 11.

The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020, also seeks to amend Sections 1(2), 14 and 15 the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 to ensure that sale or purchase of wheat or paddy in the State is not allowed below the MSP. The amendment Bill also seeks to provide for punishment for harassment of farmers or payment of less price to the farmers by inserting new Sections 6 to 11.

Meanwhile, aiming to protect the consumers from hoarding and black-marketing of agricultural produce, to secure and protect the interests and livelihood of farmers and farm labourers as also all others engaged in agriculture and related activities, the State government has brought in The Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020. The Bill seeks to amend the Centre’s The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 by amending Section 1(2) and Section 3(1A) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.

218,2020/10/20,Tragedy averted after BSF detects IEDs in Odisha’s Swabhiman Anchal,"An Intelligence-based operation was launched in the area close to the Odisha-Andhra Pradesh border on Monday.

A major tragedy was averted when Border Security Force (BSF) personnel deployed in Swabhiman Anchal, a hotbed of left wing extremists in Odisha’s Malkangiri district, detected and defused seven improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on Tuesday.

The devices were buried strategically near a bridge under a mango tree. According to the BSF, an Intelligence-based operation was launched in Swabhimaan Anchal close to the Odisha-Andhra Pradesh border on Monday.

“Operational team of BSF traced out seven IEDs in tin and steel containers on the connecting road axis of Dharlaveda-Tutugumi-Guraserthu. It is suspected to be handiwork of the rebels targeting the troop movement in the interior areas of Swabhiman Anchal,” the BSF said.

“Operational party cordoned off the area and under the supervision of the bomb disposal squad, defused the IEDs at the site early on Tuesday. No collateral damage took place,” it further said.

Area domination

The BSF assisted by State police has been trying to establish area domination in Swabhiman Anchal (formerly known as cut-off area), which was considered as a liberated zone by the Left rebels. Even State police were afraid of venturing into the cut-off area comprising of 151 villages.

However, the situation improved significantly after the deployment of the BSF and construction of a bridge over River Gurupriya that connected the cut-off area with the mainland. Earlier, the location was encircled by water from three sides and inhospitable terrain from one side.

Development work

A BSF officer on condition of anonymity said, “as we are making inroads into their stronghold everyday, these types of reactions from rebels are expected. However, we have managed to strengthen our intelligence network by involving ourselves in community work. The intelligence inputs are coming seamlessly.”

As of now, security forces dominated an area up to 25 km into Swabhiman Anchal while another 40-km-long stretch area would have to be secured from CPI (Maoists), he said.

After the recent success of security forces, the Odisha government has started expediting development works. Mobile towers have been set up in five places and people in this area may access uninterrupted cellular service shortly. Recently, a full-fledged primary health centre started functioning following the deployment of two doctors.

Encouraged by the security provided by the BSF and State police, the Malkangiri district administration started working vigorously on improving the road network. After the monsoon season, the road would be laid in the remaining 50-km stretch. A passenger bus of the Odisha State Road Transport Corporation started plying to Swabhiman Anchal for the first time months ago, but it was discontinued due to the rainy season. Sources in district administration said regular passenger bus would be run from this winter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sl6sry/article32899213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/odisha-IEDjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tragedy-averted-after-bsf-detects-ieds-in-odishas-swabhiman-anchal/article32899204.ece
219,2020/10/20,"Maharashtra rains | Fadnavis assures help from Centre, asks State to spell out its plan","Central government availing loan of ₹1 lakh crore to clear State’s debts, says the former CM while siding with Sharad Pawar on borrowing more for the sake of farmers.

Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday said the Centre would definitely help the State in the wake of damages caused due to heavy rains, but the State government should also spell out what it is doing to provide relief to the affected farmers.

Talking to reporters in Osmanabad district during a tour to assess losses caused by heavy rains, Mr. Fadnavis said the three ruling parties in the State have many differences among them, but they are expert in getting away from their responsibilities.

“The NDA government will surely help more than the earlier (UPA) government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already spoken to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and assured him about it, but the State government must also tell what it is doing to provide aid to farmers,” he said.

The Centre is also facing the COVID-19 pandemic as is the State government, he said.

“But, the Centre will not stop funding the State. The Centre has already paid ₹20,000 crore till March this year.

To pay further debts of the State, the central government is taking a loan of ₹1 lakh crore,” said the Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly.

“Due to heavy rains, the soil of farms is washed away at many places. Hence, a scheme should be initiated to help farmers facing such issues,” he said.

Wells are filled with silt and orchards have also suffered damages due to the heavy rains, he noted.

“Earlier, our government considered a photograph of losses as the survey. On the same lines, the present State government must work and complete surveys fast and immediate help should be given to farmers in rain-hit areas,” he said.

He showed to reporters two past videos in which Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, were seen demanding concrete help for farmers from the then Fadnavis-led government.

“Those who demanded aid for farmers earlier have a chance to keep their word now. Those in the government should be more patient, but the ruling party leaders are indulging in politics. The State should help the farmers,” he said.

Targeting NCP chief Sharad Pawar, whose party is an ally of the State government, Mr. Fadnavis said, “Mr. Pawar never says anything wrong. He knows the way and when the central government’s aid will come to State.”

“At present, he has a responsibility to defend the inefficiency of the present State government and he is doing that,” he added.

Mr. Fadnavis further said he agreed with Sharad Pawar that the State government needs to take loan for helping farmers.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has increased the loan limit of Maharashtra to ₹1.20 lakh crore.

He also said that there are complaints that government officials have not reached out to farmers for surveys of the damage caused due to heavy rains and floods.

The State should increase its manpower and get the surveys done, he said.

Asked about the State government’s decision to allow women to travel in local trains in Mumbai, Mr. Fadnavis said the Railways has taken a clear stand over this and demanded information regarding the necessary number of trains and other issues.

“If such details are provided, the Railways can accordingly run the trains (for women),” he said.

On the Maharashtra government’s decision to conduct a probe into the “irregularities” in the Jalyukt Shivar water conservation scheme, a pet project of Mr. Fadnavis, the BJP leader said, “The State government cannot shut my mouth by such inquiries.”

“Leader of Opposition is of the people and he will speak for the people. There were six lakh works done under the scheme in a decentralised manner and only 700 complaints are received,” he said.

“I will talk more on it after the present crisis of farmers is over,” he added.

On Mr. Pawar’s claim that those who left the NCP earlier were keen to come back to the party, Mr. Fadnavis said: “Not a single person (from BJP) will go.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qp5w7t/article31262979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEVENDRAFADNAVIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-rains-fadnavis-assures-help-from-centre-asks-state-to-spell-out-its-plan/article32898919.ece

The three State Bills provide for imprisonment of not less than three years and fines for sale-purchase of wheat or paddy under a farming agreement below the MSP, besides prevention of hoarding and black-marketing of agricultural produce, among other things.

The provision of punishment for sale-purchase below the MSP has been incorporated in The Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020.

The Bill provides that no sale or purchase is done below the MSP and violation of the same shall invite imprisonment of three years besides fine. It seeks to ensure that no sale or purchase of wheat or paddy under a farming agreement shall be allowed below the MSP.

It seeks to ensure status quo ante as on June 4, 2020 with regard to implementation of the Central Act namely, ‘The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020’.

Fourth Bill

A fourth Bill - The Code of Civil Procedure (Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020 was also passed, which seeks to insert a provision for exemption of agriculture land not exceeding 2.5 acres from Section 60 of The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which provides for attachment or decree of various properties - moveable and immoveable. Proviso-b to this Section states that the properties of the farmers such as cattle, implements, cowsheds, etc, would be exempt from attachment, but as on date agriculture land can be attached.

All MLAs unanimously voted in favour of the resolution and the Bills, except the two BJP members who were absent from the House during the second day of the special Assembly session. The resolution, which was passed, described the Centre’s farm laws and the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 as ‘anti-farmers’ and demanded that they be scrapped.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh informed the House that he had sought time from the President of India to raise Punjab’s concerns on the farm laws. He appealed to farmers’ unions to allow movement of trains for the transportation of coal, urea and grains. He pointed out that the State government has already lost ₹40,000 crore in revenue due to the ongoing “rail roko” agitation. Industry and business was as much the responsibility of the State government as was agriculture, he said, adding that the farmers’ fight was against Delhi, not against Punjab.

Earlier, responding to a suggestion from Leader of the Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, on MSP guarantee by the State government, the Chief Minister asked the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader if he had any idea about the financial implications of such a move. In any case, where would the State sell the produce even if it purchased the same, he added, terming the suggestion impractical.

Later, the Chief Minister, along with Congress, AAP and Shiromani Akali Dal MLAs met Governor V.P.S Badnore and submitted the House resolution.

Talking to journalists, Capt. Amarinder said his government was all set to take legal recourse if the Governor did not sign the amendment Bills.

Asked about the possibility of the Centre imposing President’s rule in the State to scuttle the attempts to negate the farm Laws, he said, “Let’s wait and see... we will move step by step.” However, if the situation came to such a pass, the Centre would not need to dismiss him as he was carrying his resignation in his pocket and would give it willingly, rather than compromise on the interests of Punjab and its farmers, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vd65fi/article32898631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN20PUNJAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-govt-presents-3-bills-to-negate-centres-three-agriculture-laws/article32898619.ece
223,2020/10/20,BJD MP seeks Lok Sabha Speaker’s protection in viral video case,"The 27-year-old tribal woman elected from Keonjhar Lok Sabha seat alleged that several “false and fake” news programmes were run on OTV since October 15.

Biju Janata Dal MP Chandrani Murmu on Monday sought protection from the Lok Sabha Speaker alleging that attempts are being made to subvert the truth in a case related to the viral “morphed obscene” video of her.

The 27-year-old tribal woman elected from Keonjhar Lok Sabha seat moved a notice to initiate a breach of privilege proceeding against OTV, owned by BJP national vice-president and former MP Baijayant Panda’s family.

“You had commended me on being the youngest MP of India and that too being a tribal lady. However, with deep pain, I am compelled to bring this notice to initiate a breach of privilege proceedings against Odisha TV (OTV), Bhubaneswar,” Ms. Murmu said in a petition to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.

Claiming that an OTV reporter and others made viral a “morphed obscene” video of her with “malicious intent to defame, harass and mentally torture,” the young MP said the police during the investigation had arrested a junior reporter of the channel along with others in 2019.

The arrested OTV junior reporter had named Ramesh Rath as the perpetrator of the crime. But when the police examined the perpetrator of the crime on October 15, 2020, OTV has attempted to subvert the truth, she alleged in the petition to the Speaker.

When contacted, OTV reporter Ramesh Rath denied allegations against him and claimed that he is innocent. “I am in no way connected with the viral of the MPs video. The police unnecessarily harassed me,” Rath told PTI. He said his two mobile phones have been seized by the police.

Ms. Murmu alleged that several “false and fake” news programmes were run on OTV since October 15.

She alleged that the television channel attempted to inform people that Rath was picked up by the police for a news item on Chief Minister Naveen Patnaiks aerial flood visit on August 31 and not for her viral video.

“It is aimed at concealing the truth that Rath is one of the perpetrators of the crime against me. I will not dwell on the criminal investigation part and criminality as the privilege proceedings are not meant to look into that,” Murmu mentioned in the letter.

“However, my privilege as a Member of the Lok Sabha, Parliament of India has been grievously affected and violated.

OTV has launched vicious and malicious propaganda with an ill intention to derail the investigation. I am tendering this notice to you, seeking your protection to ensure that the OTV channel be restrained from airing such fake and false stories with a malicious intent to save its reporter Ramesh Rath,” she said.

Ms. Murmu also informed the Lok Sabha Speaker that she is ready to appear as a witness in this case and provide the facts before the Speaker and the Privileges Committee.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/n3uk56/article32898431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Murmu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjd-mp-seeks-lok-sabha-speakers-protection-in-viral-video-case/article32898456.ece
224,2020/10/20,Sealing of 'Kashmir Times' office raises outcry in Valley,"National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party condemn the action

The Jammu and Kashmir administration’s move to seal the Srinagar office of Kashmir Times has evoked strong reactions from the media fraternity in the Valley and political parties.

“The Estates Department locked the Kashmir Times office without any due process of cancellation and eviction, same way as I was evicted from a flat in Jammu, where my belongings, including valuables, were handed over to “new allottee”. Vendetta for speaking out! No due process followed. How peevish!” its editor Anuradha Bhasin said.

Ms. Bhasin, who filed a petition before the Supreme Court on the media gag last year, has been at the forefront of fighting against the Internet ban in J&K and for press freedom after the abrogation of J&K’s special status on August 5 last year.

According to the Kashmir Times management, nothing in writing was given to the publication.

“The Estates Department did not give any reasons for the government action. Its employees, who came to the newspaper’s office to lock it, told the staffers to move out. When the management asked for the orders, the Estates Department officials said that they had no orders and asked them to approach the senior officers instead”, the management said.

This comes just days after the employees of a wire service, “Kashmir News Service”, were asked to vacate a building “without proper notice”.

Journalists’ statement

The journalists in the Valley have condemned the action. “In solidarity with Ms. Bhasin, a group of journalists have offered their professional services free. There are renewed attempts by the state agencies to throttle Kashmir Times, a respected newspaper in both Jammu and Kashmir regions with a rich history of practicing independent journalism.

A group of 12 Valley-based journalists wrote in a joint statement, “In view of these government-sponsored intimidation attempts to silence an independent newspaper, we express our solidarity and support to its editors and our colleagues there.”

The National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have also condemned the move.

“This explains why some of our “esteemed” publications have decided to become Government mouthpieces, printing only government press handouts. The price of independent reportage is to be evicted without due process,” NC vice president and ex-Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted.

PDP president Mehbboba Mufti said Ms. Bhasin was one of the few local newspaper editors in J&K “who stood up to the Government of India's illegal and disruptive actions in the state”.

“Shutting down her office in Srinagar is straight out of the BJPs vendetta play book to settle scores with those who dare to disagree”, she stated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/buljrv/article32898182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDKASHMIRTIMES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/authorities-seal-office-of-kashmir-times-in-srinagar/article32898183.ece

Five southern districts — Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Ganjam and Gajapati — are likely to receive heavy rain from Tuesday as yellow warning has been issued for these districts.

On Wednesday, apart from these southern districts, three coastal districts — Puri, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara — will be affected by the atmospheric system.

The India Meteorological Department issued orange warning for Puri and Ganjam districts for Thursday and disaster management agencies are worried about heavy downpour.

The intensity of rainfall would gradually slowdown in the next two days on October 23 and 24, but entire coastal districts are likely to bear the brunt of heavy precipitation. The IMD has kept the yellow warning for October 23 and 24.

“Districts under orange and yellow warning should remain in readiness to meet any eventuality. Continuous vigil of low lying areas and dewatering wherever required, including urban areas, may be taken up,” said Special Relief Commissioner P. K. Jena.

Control room

Meanwhile, the Water Resource department has emptied some of reservoirs in southern Odisha to 65-70% level in order to accommodate additional rainwater flowing into these reservoirs. A control room is operating to gauge impact of atmospheric system on hourly basis.

Both Ganjam and Gajapati district administrations have asked people staying on hilltops to come down to safer places. In 2018, Cyclone Titli had caused extensive damage as people, mostly tribals, were caught unaware about heavy rain.

A day after Congress leader Kamal Nath described a woman Minister in Madhya Pradesh as an “item”, a video on Monday showed Minister Bisahulal Singh describing the wife of his Congress opponent in the by-election a “mistress”.

In a video clip that went viral, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Minister Bisahulal Singh is heard saying, “When nomination papers are filed, you give out details of properties. However, Vishwanath Singh [Congress candidate] has not provided details of his first wife. He has given details of his rakhail (mistress). It should be found out where his first wife is.”

Writing to CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Mr. Nath said such remarks, let alone be spoken, were not even appropriate to be heard in Indian culture. While responding to Mr. Chouhan’s appeal to Congress president Sonia Gandhi to remove him from all posts for his comment, Mr. Nath retorted: “It would have been better if you had written to your party president instead and apologised to the State’s women.”

The plea by Delhi Labour Union said that women be provided special casual or paid leave as menstruation is intrinsically related to human dignity and by not providing separate toilet facilities, breaks to maintain hygiene during the particular period and paid leaves in form of special casual leaves, the authorities are depriving the employees of their dignity.

231,2020/10/20,"Direct fight between Cong., BJP in Baroda","Independent withdraws nomination

In a boost to the prospects of Congress in the Baroda bypoll, Independent candidate Kapoor Narwal, a BJP rebel, withdrew his nomination on Monday and announced his support to two-time Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

The withdrawal of the candidature by Mr. Narwal now makes it a direct contest between Congress’ Induraj Bhalu and Bharatiya Janata Party’s Yogeshwar Dutt, an Olympic medalist.

Besides Mr. Narwal, two more Independents, including Joginder Mor, withdrew their candidature and seven nominations were rejected leaving 14 candidates in the fray. Mr. Mor also announced his support to the Congress candidate.

Welcoming the decision of Mr. Narwal, Mr. Hooda said it was an “important” decision and would enhance his political and social stature. Mr. Hooda added that Mr. Narwal had taken a “right decision” at the “right time” and would emerge as the “Kingmaker of Haryana”.

Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda said the countdown of the ruling BJP-JJP coalition would begin soon after the counting of votes would end at Baroda. “The people of the State are now demanding change because this government has wasted six years of the State and has left it on the verge of total financial collapse,” said Mr. Hooda.

Earlier in a day of hectic political activities, Meham Independent MLA Balraj Kundu, who had earlier supported the candidature of Mr. Narwal, withdraw his decision saying that it would benefit the BJP. He also made an appeal to Mr. Narwal to withdraw his nomination. Mr. Kundu said he had always fought for the poor, the workers and the farmers, and could not let BJP win at any cost. He also pledged support to the Hoodas.

Snubbed by parties

Mr. Kapoor Narwal, a former Indian National Lok Dal leader, had joined the BJP in 2014 and was among the probables for the by-poll, but reached out to the Hoodas recently for a Congress ticket after failing to get any assurance from his party. However, the Congress too rejected his candidature, despite the Hoodas insistence, after state party chief Kumar Selja put her foot down for a party’s worker to be its nominee.

Snubbed by both parties, Mr. Narwal, a strong Jat leader, then threw his hat in the ring as an Independent making it a triangular contest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/direct-fight-between-cong-bjp-in-baroda/article32896061.ece
232,2020/10/20,Air pollution can be tackled in less than four years: Kejriwal,"He asks Centre to call meeting of U.P., Punjab, Haryana and Delhi CMs every month

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that if all the governments work hard and make honest efforts together, then pollution caused due to stubble burning could be substantially reduced within a short period of time.

Agreeing with Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar that stubble burning is a big problem, Mr. Kejriwal disagreed with his statement that the problem cannot be solved in a short time.

“I completely agree with his views and I believe that all the State governments should come together and launch a battle against air pollution. But he also said that the problem of air pollution cannot be solved in one day and it will take a minimum of four years to solve the issue. I do not agree with this statement,” he said.

“I believe that if all the State governments come together and all the political parties work honestly by keeping aside their political bias, then we can combat the issue of air pollution in less than four years,” he said.

“Till now the Central government is only convening meetings with the Environment Ministers of the States of north India. I want to request the Union Environment Minister to call a meeting of the Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi every month because this is a big issue and it can’t be managed only at the level of the Environment Ministers of these States,” the Delhi Chief Minister said.

Mr. Kejriwal said that while Indian Agricultural Research Institute (PUSA) scientists had developed a chemical that decomposes stubble and turns it into manure in Delhi, there was a factory in Karnal where stubble gets converted to compressed bio-gas (CBG) which can be used just as CNG.

In Punjab, he said, there are around seven factories which make coal and coke from stubble. People from these factories go to the fields, cut the stubble and pay the farmers on ₹500-per-acre basis. Later these companies sell the coal to NTPC.

‘Products from stubble’

“This means that from stubble we can produce coal, coke, CNG and cardboards. If the State governments of India start utilising these new technologies by which rather than burning the stubble the farmers can increase their income by selling the stubble, then it can put a halt to this problem,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4kbth8/article32896056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE19-KEJRIWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/air-pollution-can-be-tackled-in-less-than-four-years-kejriwal/article32896057.ece

Ahmedabad will host the day-night pink ball Test during England’s tour of India early next year, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly said here on Tuesday.

England is scheduled to visit India between January and March for five Tests and a limited overs series.

“Ahmedabad will hold the day-night Test,” Ganguly said while launching a book written by CPI(M) MLA Ashok Bhattacharya.

BCCI is determined to host England and it is already exploring all possible options, including creating bio-secure bubbles.

Ahmedabad, Dharamsala and Kolkata are likely to be the three Test venues. “We have made some tentative plans but nothing has been decided as of now. We still have four months’ time.”

He added the priority now is the upcoming Australia tour and the team selection will take place in a few days.

“We have Australia series coming up. The team will be selected in a few days’ time.”

234,2020/10/20,"IPL 2020 | It will be an MI-DC final, says Aakash Chopra","Says RCB will be the third side and there will be a stiff competition for the fourth

Former India batsman Aakash Chopra expects Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals to square off in the final of IPL 2020.

“I find them very balanced, even though Delhi is now having a fair bit of injury worries. They still have enough resources. I see Delhi-Mumbai as finalists,” said Chopra on the Tissot Presents Sportstar Extras T20 Time show.

While Chopra predicts Royal Challengers Bangalore to be the third team to make the playoffs, he feels that the competition will be stiffer for the fourth spot. “There will be a scamper for that [fourth] berth. There are quite a few teams that are there, and in the end, it may not be about which is the best of the remaining teams,” he said. “The teams with fewer holes will reach the final four and not necessarily the one with the steadiest ship.”

Chopra, who played for Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2008, says the tournament was like nothing that he had seen before. “I remember walking out on the field for an IPL game and asking myself and the people around whether we were there to play cricket. Because that was the first time the loudspeakers were at their loudest,” he recalled.

235,2020/10/20,"Indian Premier League 2020, KXIP vs DC | Kings’ resurgence continues with impressive win over Capitals","Pooran’s rapid fifty trumps Dhawan’s historic unbeaten hundred; Rahul’s men have now beaten the top three teams back to back and climbed to fifth on the table

The pitches are slowing down in the United Arab Emirates, but nothing seems to be affecting Shikhar Dhawan.

The Delhi Capitals opener scored his second successive hundred (106 n.o., 61b, 12x4, 3x6), but the effort couldn’t prevent Kings XI Punjab, which had suffered a Super Over defeat the last time the two sides met, from tasting sweet revenge.

Riding on Nicholas Pooran’s 28-ball 53 (6x4, 3x6), KXIP chased down the target of 165 with six balls to spare at the Dubai International Stadium on Tuesday.

Gayle’s cameo

Although K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal did not fire, Chris Gayle turbocharged the chase with 29 off just 13 balls (3x4, 2x6).

DC captain Shreyas Iyer had the arsenal to restrict Gayle — R. Ashwin has an excellent record against him — but pacer Tushar Deshpande was introduced ahead of the off-spinner.

The youngster leaked 26 runs, with Gayle tonking him all around the park for three fours and two sixes.

Eventually, it was Ashwin who went through the big man’s gate — it was the fifth time he has dismissed Gayle in the IPL.

Audacious strokeplay

But Pooran and Glenn Maxwell (32, 24b, 3x4) added 69 for the fourth wicket to close in on the target, with the former constantly advancing the game with audacious strokeplay.

Indeed, Pooran’s six off Marcus Stoinis over long-on was perhaps the shot of the match.

Kagiso Rabada (two for 27), Axar Patel (one for 27) and Ashwin (one for 27) did apply the brakes, but it wasn’t enough. As a result, Dhawan’s splendid innings ended up on the losing side.

Having made an unbeaten 101 against Chennai Super Kings in the previous game, the southpaw became the first batsman to score back-to-back hundreds in IPL history.

Dhawan propped up the DC innings, doing the bulk of the scoring, as Prithvi Shaw’s miserable run continued, and Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant and Stoinis couldn’t really get going.

Making inroads

KXIP made inroads in the middle overs and its bowling effort in the second half of the innings meant DC was “about 10 runs short”, as per Shreyas’ estimate in the post-match ceremony.

Mohammed Shami (two for 28) was excellent again for KXIP.

With the victory, Rahul’s men moved to fifth, with eight points, while Shreyas’ side remained on top.

236,2020/10/20,Zimbabwe coach Rajput skips Pakistan tour after Indian Embassy in Harare seeks “exemption”,"In Rajput’s absence, bowling coach Douglas Hondo would take charge of the team during the tour

Zimbabwe cricket coach Lalchand Rajput has not travelled with the team for a tour of Pakistan after the Indian embassy in Harare requested his exemption from the limited-overs series.

A statement from Zimbabwe Cricket said that Rajput won’t be a part of the tour following the request from the Indian embassy. In Rajput’s absence, bowling coach Douglas Hondo would take charge of the team during the tour.

“@Lalchandrajput7 will miss the @TheRealPCB tour after the Embassy of India in Harare wrote to @ZimCricketv asking that he be exempted from visiting Pakistan. The Embassy of Pakistan in Harare had issued a visa to Rajput,” the ZC tweeted.

“With @Lalchandrajput7 unavailable, @ZimCricketv has appointed bowling coach Douglas Hondo to take charge of the team for the three ODIs and as many T20Is games against @TheRealPCB.”

The Zimbabwean team is scheduled to play three ODIs against Pakistan in Rawalpindi, starting October 30, before moving to Lahore for three T20Is. The visiting team arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday.

ESPNcricinfo reported that the exemption for Rajput was sought citing “travel guidelines of the (Indian) government for its citizens”.

A PCB spokesperson called it an internal matter of Zimbabwe Cricket.

“The Zimbabwe Cricket officials had got a visa for Mr Lalchand Rajput from the Pakistan High Commission in Harare and if he has not come this is an internal matter between ZC and Mr Rajput,” he said.

However, a top source in the PCB said that the directives of the Indian government to not allow Rajput to visit Pakistan had caused some concerns in the Board. India and Pakistan have had no bilateral cricketing ties due to tense diplomatic ties between the two countries.

“The concerns are genuine because the PCB is waiting for confirmation from the ICC and BCCI by January-February that the national team would be issued visas by the Indian government for next year’s World T20 in India,” the source said.

“Makes no sense to stop him from travelling to Pakistan when he has been issued a visa. The PCB is bound to provide the best security and hospitality to the visiting contingent as per regulations,” he added.

The PCB has also invited South Africa and England to send teams to Pakistan in January-February.

A delegation of Cricket South Africa is due in Lahore next month during the Pakistan Super League matches to inspect the security arrangements for their team.

The 58-year-old Rajput was appointed as Zimbabwe’s full time coach in August 2018, after the team’s failure to qualify for the 2019 World Cup.

He played two Tests and four ODIs for India between 1985 and 1987.

The Zimbabwe players were required to undergo two COVID-19 tests - one in Harare prior to their departure on Monday, and another on Tuesday.

Kris Srikkanth, the former India batsman and selection committee chief, has slammed Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s “ridiculous” calls for Chennai Super Kings in the ongoing IPL and asked what “spark” did he see in the under-performing Kedar Jadhav.

Srikkanth was referring to Dhoni’s remark that the youngsters in the Chennai Super Kings squad did not show the spark needed to challenge the seniors and break into the playing XI.

“I will never accept what Dhoni is saying about this ‘process’,” Srikkanth told Star Sports Tamil.

“This ‘process’ he keeps talking about is meaningless. You keep talking about ‘process, process’... but the process of selection itself is wrong.

“What is Dhoni’s deal? He says (N) Jagadeesan (uncapped wicketkeeper-batsman) doesn’t have spark, but does ‘scooter’ Jadhav have that spark? This is ridiculous. I will not accept this answer today. All this talk of ‘process’, and Chennai’s tournament itself is over,” he added.

Jagadeesan has played just one match so far.

CSK currently lie bottom of the heap and succumbed to a seven-wicket loss against Rajasthan Royals here on Monday for their seventh defeat in the league.

Srikkanth, who was the team mentor and brand ambassador of CSK in the inaugural edition of the IPL, also questioned Piyush Chawla’s selection.

“Dhoni now says that since the pressure is off, he’ll give the youngsters a chance. Come on, yaar. I don’t understand this rubbish about the process at all.

“Karn Sharma at least took wickets. Chawla simply goes through the motions of bowling, coming on when the game is already lost. There is no doubt Dhoni is great, but I cannot agree with him or accept this.”

Dhoni’s remarks, after the game, were met with severe criticism on social media.

“Fair enough, this season we weren’t really there,” Dhoni said at the presentation ceremony.

“Also the youngsters, we didn’t see the spark to push the guys. But what this result has done is give those youngsters a chance in the rest of the tournament.

238,2020/10/20,"IPL 2020 | Boosted by Ferguson’s entry, KKR looks to make amends against RCB","It will be interesting to see how Morgan uses the Kiwi pacer against the likes of De Villiers, RCB skipper Virat Kohli and opener Aaron Finch.

Kolkata Knight Riders have finally found their mojo with the late inclusion of tearaway pacer Lockie Ferguson and they would look to avenge their first leg rout by the star-studded Royal Challengers Bangalore when the two sides clash in the IPL in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.

It needed KKR nine games, and a change of captaincy, to realise the true potential of the World Cup star pacer for runners-up New Zealand, and when the Eoin Morgan-led side finally brought him in, he blew away Sunrisers Hyderabad with his relentless pace and variations.

Ferguson made all the difference to KKR’s yet another ordinary show, returning with sensational figures of 3/15 (four overs) and 2/2 from three balls in Super-Over.

The imposing bowler, who returned with just two wickets from five games for KKR last season, was on the go from his first ball when he claimed his Kiwi skipper Kane Williamson, brilliantly mixing up his raw pace with slow deliveries to nail the opposition.

It’s a welcome inclusion for the Morgan-led KKR (10 points) who are placed fourth with five matches left and Ferguson will be their key man to take them to the playoffs at a time when their star Aussie recruit Pat Cummins (three wickets from nine matches) is not making much of an impact of late.

AB de Villiers’ incredible assault of 73 not out from 33 balls, which had led to an 82-run defeat not many days ago, will be still fresh in their minds.

It will be interesting to see how Morgan uses Ferguson against the likes of De Villiers, RCB skipper Virat Kohli and opener Aaron Finch.

Ferguson’s inclusion gave the much-needed impetus to the side, but KKR are still struggling with their star all-rounder Andre Russell who capped yet another flop show with the bat.

Their go-to man in the last edition, Russell has just 92 runs from nine matches at an average of 11.50. The opposition bowlers seem to have found out his weakness for short deliveries.

If his abysmal form was not enough, the Jamaican has also picked up some niggles on the field and it would not be a bad ploy to give him a breather.

In spin, it remains to be seen whether they bring in Sunil Narine, whose action has been cleared.

Kuldeep Yadav, who too was included against SRH after being benched for eight matches, looked decent along with their regular spinner Varun Chakravarthy.

RCB, on the other hand, are ahead of KKR by two points and occupy the third place in the table after their seven-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals.

De Villiers has been in ominous form for them and single-handedly won the game with an unbeaten 55 from 22 balls in their 178-run chase against the Royals.

Skipper Virat Kohli will also look to convert his starts as they look to brighten their playoff hopes with a double against KKR.

239,2020/10/20,"IPL 2020 | CSK ‘running out of juice’, will bring in more youngsters: coach Stephen Fleming","The coach admitted that age would be a factor in the third year, and that the conditions in the UAE require a whole new set of requirements.

Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni say that the bottom-placed team will ring in the changes in its upcoming IPL matches by trying out youngsters even though the captain is yet to notice the requisite “spark” in them.

With just three wins from 10 matches so far, CSK now have only mathematical chances of making the play-offs. They next take on the defending champions on October 23.

“I think it’s fair that we will be turning that over,” Fleming said after the seven-wicket loss to Rajasthan Royals when asked if there will be a shift from the team’s policy of sticking to a squad.

The three-time winners’ poor run this season has put a question-mark on the approach and Dhoni, trying to justify it, said that the younger lot has not done enough to force a change, until now.

“You don’t want to chop and change. Insecurity is something you don’t want to prevail in the dressing room. Also the youngsters, we didn’t see the spark to push the guys,” Dhoni said at the presentation ceremony on Monday.

“But what this result has done is give those youngsters a chance in the rest of the tournament. Maybe going forward we bring them in and they play without pressure,” he added.

Fleming said the current slump should not be a bolt from the blue for the side, which has an average age of over 30.

“We have been really consistent over the years with our selection. It is fair to say that looking at the table now, this team has run out of a bit of juice. But if you look at the three-year cycle we won the first year, lost the last one last year,” Fleming explained.

“We always thought the third year was an ageing group and would be difficult and Dubai has chanced us with a whole new set of requirements.

“We have some players that we will look at,” the former New Zealand captain added.

Fleming said the slow conditions and some superb bowling by Royals spinners did not let his side settle into a rhythm.

“When in slow conditions you are exposed to spinners, it is difficult to get the innings underway. We lost wickets throughout. The consolidation period became longer. We could not get momentum.”

Asked about not bowling a spinner after 12 overs, Fleming said, “It’s more of a question for MS, to be fair.”

“They are trying out. Even in Sharjah, it felt that it goes easier towards the evening. They (Smith and Buttler) played the spinners out of the game with their partnership, Buttler batted exceptionally.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/6d9ghi/article32898928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CSK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-csk-running-out-of-juice-will-bring-in-more-youngsters-coach-stephen-fleming/article32898929.ece
240,2020/10/20,"Extended bio bubbles can cause ‘extreme burnout’, warn Morgan and Holder","Both the World Cup-winning captain and the West Indies skipper have spent time in bio-secure bubbles over the past few months, including the one put in place by the England and Wales Cricket Board

Eoin Morgan and Jason Holder have expressed their reservations about players spending long periods of time in bio-secure bubbles, warning that it can lead to “extreme burnout“.

Both Morgan and Holder have spent time in bio-secure bubbles over the past few months, including the one put in place by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to manage the home summer season.

Watch | Decoding the bio-bubble at IPL 2020

“We managed to fulfil all of our international fixtures for the summer. That was an unbelievable achievement for the teams that came across and the commitment the ECB showed. We’re extremely fortunate enough to be back playing,” Morgan was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.

The English white-ball skipper added that players can’t be expected to to spend extended periods in these bubble.

“But to keep that level of bubble for a 12-month period, or 10 of the 12 months that we normally travel, I think is untenable. I actually think it’s probably one of the more challenging times for anybody involved in the cricket industry.”

“You can drill a player both mentally and physically. And it can cause extreme burnout, which nobody wants to see,” he added.

Holder, who led the West Indies squad to England — marking the resumption of international cricket after the coronavirus outbreak — was in complete agreement with Morgan.

“It’s been demanding. It has been challenging. I’m blessed to be still working. There are lots of people in the world not working because of Covid and we’re still given the opportunity to entertain people and do something we really love.

“But something needs to be thought of in order to just try to free up things a little bit more for the players’ mental health,” Holder added.

The 34-year-old Morgan predicted that more and more players will pull-out from tours to protect their mental health.

“As a team, we’ve accepted that guys will come in and out of the bubble as they feel it’s affecting their mental health. Their health is a priority.”

“So I do think we’ll see more players pull out of tours. That’s just the reality of things. And I don’t think people should look down on it: they shouldn’t feel like they’re not doing their job or not committing to their country,” he added.

Mental health of athletes has come to the fore in the past couple of years, more so now with players spending time isolated from their families and friends.

“Lockdown for us in the UK was primarily focused on physical wellbeing, but maybe that was detriment of mental wellbeing.

“We actually want to be at the forefront of making it acceptable for people to say: ‘You know what, I need to spend time with my family now. I’m going to take this tour off.’ And then they step away for a month, just because of the extraordinary circumstances,” Morgan said.

Holder himself has spent several weeks in isolation due to the Test series against England, Caribbean Premier League and the IPL.

“I had two months in (the bubble) England. Then I was home literally for two days before I went to Trinidad (for the CPL) for a month-and-a-half. Then I spent four or five days at home in Barbados before I got a call to come over. So you’re back into isolation.

“And if you look at scheduling, it doesn’t get any easier. It’s literally going from bubble to bubble. Some places are accepting families and some aren’t.

“So it makes it harder to be away from your family and your loved ones. I haven’t seen Barbados properly in about five months and I don’t know when I’ll get back there,” Holder added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/59qadr/article32898894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMORGANHOLDER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/extended-bio-bubbles-can-cause-extreme-burnout-warn-morgan-and-holder/article32898895.ece
241,2020/10/20,New Zealand’s Ben Lister becomes first COVID-19 substitute,"Auckland medium pacer Ben Lister on Tuesday became the first COVID-19 substitute in cricket, replacing teammate Mark Chapman in the ongoing Plunket Shield first-class cricket championship.

The 26-year-old Chapman, who has represented New Zealand in six ODIs and 24 T20Is, reportedly felt sick on Monday following which the batsman underwent a COVID-19 test.

Lister, who has featured in 18 first class games, was named as the replacement until Chapman’s test results are known.

“Ollie Pringle makes his First-Class debut becoming No. Keycap digit fiveKeycap digit twoKeycap digit four. Ben Lister starts as Covid-19 replacement with Mark Chapman awaiting test results after feeling ill yesterday,” Auckland Cricket tweeted.

New Zealand coach Gary Stead, who was watching the match at Eden Park, said he was pleased that Chapman was not penalised for doing the right thing.

“I wasn’t aware until I got here this morning, that Mark Chapman had been feeling ill and had to get a Covid test. But from my perspective, it’s great that he’s not penalised for doing the right thing in what is obviously different times we face in the world,” Stead was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.

“Just shows that we and cricket aren’t immune to that either, so following the right protocols is definitely the right thing to do,” he added.

242,2020/10/20,"Indian Premier League 2020 | We didn’t see the spark in our youngsters to push them in, says Dhoni","Three-time winners CSK, who have been criticised for continuing with their old warhorses, suffered their seventh defeat in the ongoing IPL.

Chennai Super Kings skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Monday said the youngsters in his squad did not show the spark needed to break into the playing XI at the expense of the veterans.

Three-time winners CSK, who have been criticised for continuing with their old warhorses, suffered their seventh defeat in the ongoing IPL, this time to Rajasthan Royals.

“You don’t want to chop and change. Insecurity is something you don’t want to prevail in the dressing room. Fair enough, this season we weren’t really there,” Dhoni said at the presentation ceremony after suffering the seven-wicket loss.

“Also the youngsters, we didn’t see the spark to push the guys. But what this result has done is give those youngsters a chance in the rest of the tournament.

“Maybe going forward we bring them in and they play without pressure.”

RR restricted CSK to a modest 125 for five after being invited to bowl and then overcame the target in 17.3 overs, thanks to a 98-run fourth wicket partnership between Jos Buttler (70) and skipper Steve Smith (26).

Dhoni said, “There was a bit for the fast bowlers and the reason I brought (Ravindra) Jadeja was to see how much it was stopping and it didn’t as much as the first innings. So I went with the fast bowlers. I don’t think the spinners got as much bite.

“It’s not always supposed to go your way. We have to see if the process was wrong. Result is a by-product of the process, but the fact still remains that if you’re focused on the process then the undue pressure of result doesn’t enter the dressing room.”

RR captain Smith was relieved to have secured a crucial win at an important stage of the tournament.

“The wicket was stopping, wasn’t easy for batting. Strange game but nice to be on the winning side.

“I thought we bowled pretty well in the powerplay and the spinners did a good job in the middle with their leggies and googlies and squeezing,” he said.

“Buttler’s innings took the pressure off me at the other end. It was a really good innings on a wicket that wasn’t the easiest,” Smith added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wa8rgb/article32896161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DHONI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-we-didnt-see-the-spark-in-our-youngsters-to-push-them-in-says-dhoni/article32896162.ece

COVID-19 restrictions kept people indoors for over four months and after the State government relaxed norms, shops and commercial establishments were opened in a phased manner adhering to various guidelines.

Deepavali falls on November 14 and people have started thronging textile showrooms from Sunday to avoid last minute rush and large gatherings. Also, the number of people visiting shops is expected to increase during the Puja holidays this weekend. Hence, to monitor the crowd and regulate traffic, the police have planned to step up surveillance in market areas, bus stand and at places where people gather in large numbers.

Erection of watchtowers is completed at Manikoondu, Panneerselvam Park, Eswaran Kovil Street, R.K.V. Road, Nethaji Road, Kalaimadu Silai, Swastik Corner, near Krishna Theatre and at bus stand. Since most of the textile and gold jewellery showrooms are located on R.K.V. Road, additional watchtowers are installed on the road.

Town DSP Raju said public address systems would be installed in the watchtowers and policemen would be monitoring the crowd using binoculars and footage of closed circuit television cameras. They would maintain vigil over pocket pickers and bag-lifters and also regulate traffic to ensure free flow of vehicles.

The demand for puffed rice is usually very high during the puja. “This year, we have received just 50% of the orders,” said M. Gopalakrishnan of Veerappanchatiram, a wholesaler. He said the pandemic had led to closure of many establishments while many businesses were yet to recover. “We usually receive bulk orders from companies. But this year, the orders were bleak,” he added.

Preparing the paddy and the process of steaming, drying and frying took five days after which it was packed in bags of 100 kg each. A few years ago, there were 12 producers in the city whereas now there were only three producers, he said and added that less profit, labour shortage and demand only during pujas had forced many production units to close down. “I cannot shift to other work. As this is my family business, I am doing it though the profit is very less,” he said. Each unit needed five workers, who were paid ₹ 500 to ₹700 a day and they worked for 10 hours a day before the puja.

The congregation of people in markets and shopping centres in the city for purchases for Navaratri and Deepavali is causing concern among the authorities, as crowds that do not adhere to safety norms can prove to be super spreaders of COVID-19.

With Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan stating on Sunday that gross negligence during Onam celebrations had led to spurt in the number of cases in Kerala, City Health Officer S. Raja called for full co-operation from the public to prevent the spread of the disease during the festival season in Coimbatore.

“A meeting of representatives from all types of shops has been planned on Thursday, at which they will be given instructions to be followed,” he said, adding that action would be taken against violators.

G. Stalin, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) said certain measures from the public could reduce the rush at markets.

“Instead of shopping on Saturday and Sunday, people can choose weekdays. It has been noticed that the majority of the people come for shopping after 5 p.m. As of now, shops are allowed to function only up to 8 p.m. This situation leads to heavy crowding in shops, which can be avoided by scheduling these visits as early as from 10 a.m. Family heads should ensure that bare minimum people go out for shopping, instead of taking all the persons as in the case of shopping in previous years,” he said.

Health and Revenue Departments, the police and the Corporation are now imposing fined on shops that violate COVID-19 safety guidelines.

On Sunday, the police imposed a fine of ₹5,000 each on Sri Ganapathy Silks and Saravana Selvarathnam stores on Oppanakara Street for violating the guidelines, said a senior official.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Natarajan said that Governor Banwarilal Purohit must approve the Bill at the earliest for the benefit of students from government schools.

The demonstration also condemned the Anna University Vice Chancellor M.K. Surappa, who recently wrote to the Central government seeking the Institute of Eminence status. Accusing the State government of taking a soft approach in this issue, the MP demanded that the Governor, who is the Chancellor of Anna University, must immediately dismiss Mr. Surappa for his allegedly unilateral actions.

257,2020/10/20,Bus service from Coimbatore to Pilloor Dam to resume soon,"A senior official from the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, Coimbatore Division, said that at least one bus service will be resumed from Coimbatore to Pilloor Dam soon.

Nearly two months after the TNSTC resumed bus services in Coimbatore district, residents of Pilloor Dam area face a lack of connectivity through buses to the city and Mettupalayam.

According to M. Mallan, a resident of Kodiyur near the Pilloor Dam, said that when his daughter-in-law went to labour in September, he had to hire a jeep to reach Mettupalayam Government Hospital for her admission. “Many families are forced to hire jeeps from local shop owners by paying ₹ 1,000 or ₹2,000 to reach Mettupalayam for any emergency purposes,” he said.

Residents of many tribal settlements located near the Pilloor Dam area are also affected by the lack of bus services, he said. Two bus services that reach Pilloor Dam by 10 a.m. and at 5 p.m. were available prior to the imposition of lockdown and these have not been resumed in the past seven months, Mr. Mallan said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bus-service-from-coimbatore-to-pilloor-dam-to-resume-soon/article32903847.ece
258,2020/10/20,Aid for rain-hit farmers: Uddhav tells Oppn. to not indulge in mud-slinging,"I spoke to PM who had assured me of every possible help: CM

Calling upon the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to desist from playing politics over the devastation wrought by the retreating monsoon, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday assured farmers that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government would not leave them in the lurch.

Speaking after visiting parts of rain-affected Solapur district, Mr. Thackeray said that the State government had not announced details of an assistance package yet simply because the retreating monsoon crisis was not yet over.

“I have not yet made any announcement as crisis is not yet over. We are collecting information regarding the extent of crop and property damage; the process of panchanamas (assessing damage) is already under way. We have started providing immediate financial assistance to the families of those who have died in rain-related incidents,” the CM said, adding that it was pointless announcing something in a hurry as the meteorological department had forecast more rain till October 24.

Stating that the priority for the administration at this stage is to avoid any further loss of life, Mr. Thackeray appealed to farmers not to despair of their situation and said that the State government would approach the Centre for any help needed.

“The State will leave no stone unturned in helping farmers. If needed, only then we will be approaching the Centre for financial assistance. I had had a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday who had assured me of every possible help,” he said, exhorting the Opposition not to transform the crisis into a ‘Centre versus State’ scenario.

The politics over excess rain was in full force with former CM and BJP’s Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis pointedly commencing his tour of rain-hit areas from Baramati — the bastion of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar.

Fadnavis hits out at govt.

Mr. Fadnavis criticised the Thackeray government for allegedly waiting for the Centre to step in without declaring financial assistance of its own accord.

“The Centre will help. It has done so in the past and will continue to do so in the future as well. Prime Minister Modi, too, has assured Maharashtra of all help. But why isn’t the State declaring its own assistance package? Last year, we had announced a ₹10,000 crore package at the time of the Sangli-Kolhapur floods without waiting for the Centre to declare aid,” Mr. Fadnavis said.

Speaking in Solapur, Mr. Thackeray, without naming Mr. Fadnavis, said that instead of canvassing for the Bihar polls (where Mr. Fadnavis had been appointed in-charge), “all of us together should be seeking relief for Maharashtra’s farmers from the Centre.”

“We have started giving immediate relief to the rain-afflicted... The Centre is not a ‘foreign’ government. It is the Centre’s duty to come to the aid of any State suffering from a natural calamity. And I think after my phone call with Mr. Modi, I am convinced that if we request the Prime Minister for aid, he will never refuse us,” the CM said, urging the Opposition not to indulge in political mud-slinging at this juncture.

Mr. Thackeray further attempted to dispel the perception, being reinforced by the State BJP leadership, of his not being on the field to monitor the situation.

“I have been continuously monitoring this situation [of excess rain] and have been in constant communication with authorities. It isn’t as if I have come to be aware of it just today,” he said, assuring farmers that he would be visiting afflicted regions tomorrow and the day after as well.

Earlier, speaking in Tuljapur, Mr. Pawar, too, had attempted to defend the CM by stating that the MVA leadership had decided that Mr. Thackeray should remain at a central place in order to monitor the situation.

“We had advised him [Mr. Thackeray] to remain at one place while the other leaders would be touring the afflicted regions…after all, the person who holds all the administrative threads must stay at one place in order to make decisions,” Mr. Pawar said.

Stressing that there was no administrative failure, Mr. Thackeray also said that the showers, whose like had not been seen by farmers in decades, were falling with a peculiar intensity.

In response, Mr. Fadnavis hit out at the CM and the MVA government, saying that it was unfortunate that it was left to a senior leader like Mr. Pawar to defend the shortcomings of the MVA government.

He further claimed that it was only after the BJP leaders had declared their tours, the guardian ministers of the ruling MVA government belatedly announced their visits.

Visiting Maladgaon in Baramati, Mr. Fadnavis said, “This is a deplorable situation. In the last eight days, no one from the district administration has made contact with the villagers. There is no aid for them; there is no electricity here as the pole has been washed away in the flood. If this village, right under the noses of the State government, is in this awful state, then one can only imagine the condition of rain-hit villages in the Marathwada.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/ljv5ah/article32896525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/aid-for-rain-hit-farmers-uddhav-tells-oppn-to-not-indulge-in-mud-slinging/article32896526.ece

The cumulative recoveries have risen to 13,84,879 with the recovery rate standing at a robust 86.48%.

Mumbai reported the biggest surge among the major pandemic-hit areas, recording 1,234 cases to take its tally to 2,43,169 of whom just 19,906 are active cases though. 43 fatalities saw the city’s toll rise to 9,819.

Nagpur district in Vidarbha reported just 275 new cases taking the total to 96,611 of whom 6,081 are active. Six deaths saw the toll climb to 2,647.

261,2020/10/20,Blanket extension of bails must end: HC,"Will sit together and take a decision on it, says court

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday remarked that its blanket order extending interim bail and parole to prisoners following the COVID-19 pandemic should come to an end.

The full Bench headed by Chief Justice D.N. Patel made the observation after the Delhi govt. in an affidavit stated that the number of infected persons in jails stands at six.

“Let us bring to an end the COVID chapter. Let these people surrender or go back to jail. We passed the order in view of the pandemic. Our order has nothing to do with overcrowding of jails. We are not concerned by the nature of the crimes,” the court said, adding it would sit together and take a decision on whether to extend the order.

The government, in response to a query from the HC during the last hearing, stated that over 5,500 prisoners have been granted interim bail since the pandemic outbreak. These include 2,318 prisoners involved in heinous crimes; 2,907 inmates involved in minor crimes; and 356 other prisoners.

During the hearing, Director General (Prisons) stated that the prisoners who are released on interim bail or parole continue to remain outside in view of the blanket order passed and extended from time-to-time by a full Bench of the High Court.

The DG (Prisons) also stated that the three jails — Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli — together have a capacity of around 10,000, but currently there are 15,900 prisoners in them.

The court was hearing an application, moved by one of the prosecutors dealing with the north-east Delhi riots cases in the trial courts, seeking modification of the High Court’s July 13 and July 24 orders by which it had clarified that its orders extending interim bails or paroles would be applicable to everyone granted the relief before or after March 16.

The application alleged that the two orders were being misused by the accused in the riots cases by seeking bail on grounds of family illness or some other reasons, instead of seeking regular bail, and then getting the same extended on the basis of the court’s direction.

The lawyer told the Bench that around 20 accused in the riots cases were out on interim bail on some pretext and are now enjoying the benefits of the High Court’s blanket order.

Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra, appearing for DG (Prisons), said that removing the blanket order would go against the spirit of the Supreme Court’s order to decongest jails during the pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/blanket-extension-of-bails-must-end-hc/article32904093.ece
262,2020/10/20,"Coronavirus | Delhi High Court to reconsider blanket extension of bails, paroles","Remark comes in the wake of a drop in the number of cases reported among prisoners.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday observed that its blanket order extending interim bails and paroles granted to prisoners in view of the COVID-19 pandemic should come to an end as the number of infected persons in jails in New Delhi was only three. According to the Director General (Prisons), over 6,700 prisoners are out on bail or parole and continue to remain outside in view of the blanket order passed and extended from time-to-time by a full Bench of the High Court.

The DG Prisons also told the High Court that the three jails - Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli - in the national capital together have a capacity of around 10,000, but presently there were 15,900 prisoners lodged in them.

The full Bench headed by Chief Justice D N Patel on Tuesday said, “Let us bring to an end the COVID chapter. Let these people surrender or go back to jail. We passed the order in view of the pandemic. Our order has nothing to do with overcrowding of the jails. We are not concerned by the nature of the crimes.”

“The COVID chapter is over. The other reasons for grant or extension of bail and parole can continue. We will go back to the situation that prevailed in January-February this year,” he added.

The Bench also observed that the prison was taking care of the issue and those who had tested positive for COVID-19 in jails have been hospitalised.

The Chief Justice said the judges of the full Bench, also including Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh, will sit together and take a decision on whether to extend the blanket or not.

The observations by the Bench came while hearing an application, moved by one of the prosecutors dealing with the northeast Delhi riots cases in the trial courts, seeking modification of the High Court’s July 13 and July 24 orders by which it had clarified that its orders extending interim bails/paroles would be applicable to everyone granted the relief before or after March 16.

The application has alleged that the two orders were being misused by the accused in the riots cases by seeking bail on grounds of family illness or some such other reasons, instead of seeking regular bail, and then getting the same extended on the basis of the High Court’s direction.

The lawyer told the Bench during the hearing around 20 accused in the riots cases were out on interim bail on some pretext and are now enjoying the benefits of the High Court’s blanket order.

He also said that the prosecution opposes grant of bail in such cases as the accused do not surrender after the bail expires in view of the High Court order.

Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra, appearing for the DG Prisons, told the Bench that removing the blanket order would go against the spirit of the Supreme Court’s order to decongest jails during the pandemic as COVID-19 cases have not gone down in the national capital.

He further said that the decongestion of the prisons has not led to any increase in crimes or anarchy in the city.

The High Court on September 28 had said it will not permit misuse of its orders and it will recall its extension order if it was being misused.

The Bench said, “If they (prisoners) are misusing it, we will stop it and then let them suffer.”

The High Court on August 24 had extended till October 31 all the interim orders which were to expire on or after August 31 in cases that are before it as also the district courts in view of the persisting COVID-19 pandemic.

It had also extended the relief in cases related to those who were out on interim bail or parole and may carry COVID-19 infection.

If interim bail of anyone is ending, they are required to surrender to the already congested and over-crowded jails, which may not be in a position to strictly maintain physical distancing amongst inmates, it may pose a risk of unchecked spread of the virus, the court had said.

On March 25, the High Court had extended till May 15 the interim orders in all matters pending before it and subordinate courts in view of the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. Thereafter, the relief was extended from time-to-time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/tetlwz/article32802941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDEXDELHIHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/coronavirus-delhi-high-court-to-reconsider-blanket-extension-of-bails-paroles/article32901280.ece
263,2020/10/20,"Delhi’s air quality improves marginally as wind speed picks up, likely to turn ‘very poor’ by Wednesday","The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 227 at 9 a.m. on Tuesday

Pollution levels dipped slightly in the national capital on Tuesday morning due to favourable wind speed, though the air quality was still in the “poor” category.

The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the air quality index (AQI) was likely to slip to the “very poor” category by Wednesday due to a change in the wind direction and a reduction in the wind speed.

The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 227 at 9 a.m. on Tuesday. The 24-hour average AQI was 244 on Monday. It was 254 on Sunday and 287 on Saturday.

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.

Calm winds and low temperatures allow the accumulation of pollutants, while high wind speed helps in their dispersion.

Expecting further deterioration in the air quality in the coming days, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Monday asked Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments to be ready to close thermal power plants that do not meet the standards laid down in 2015.

In separate letters, EPCA chief Bhure Lal asked the two State governments to review the preparedness for closing thermal power plants and to inform the pollution watchdog about it, as well as the steps that will be taken to ensure compliance with the necessary shutdown during the peak winter period.

SAFAR said a change in surface wind direction is expected by early Wednesday which is “likely to bring calm surface wind conditions, leading to low ventilation and deterioration of AQI”.

“Very poor AQI is predicted for Wednesday and Thursday,” it said.

The stubble fire count around Haryana, Punjab, and neighbouring regions stood at 1,090 on Monday. The share of farm fires in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution stood at 10%.

“Though transport-level wind direction is favourable, an increase in the wind speed and local surface winds led to a decrease in stubble (burning) contribution in Delhi’s PM2.5,” SAFAR said.

The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution stood at 17% on Sunday. It was 19% on Saturday, 18% on Friday, around one per cent on Wednesday and around three per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday.

On Monday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal requested Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar to hold monthly meetings with the CMs of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and UP to curb air pollution, saying there is a lack of political will to address the problem of stubble burning.

In a virtual press briefing, he said the affected States have been unable to find a solution to stop stubble burning and prevent air pollution. “I believe pollution due to stubble burning can be controlled in a short span of time. But a lack of political will is visible in doing that.”

Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the Delhi government will deploy 2,500 environment marshals across the city to generate awareness about its recently launched anti-pollution campaign, “Red Light On, Gaadi Off”.

He also said a meeting of environment ministers of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh with the Centre must be held every 15 days to discuss matters pertaining to pollution and stubble burning.

Such meetings will help in improving coordination between the States, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4qv5p/article32898583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhis-air-quality-improves-marginally-as-wind-speed-picks-up-likely-to-turn-very-poor-by-wednesday/article32898584.ece
264,2020/10/20,HC asks Zee News to disclose source of Delhi riots report,"Court questions how the channel got documents that even the accused did not have

The Delhi High Court on Monday directed Zee Media Corporation Limited to submit an affidavit disclosing the source of its news report on an alleged disclosure statement of a Jamia Millia Islamia student, Asif Iqbal Tanha, who was arrested in a case related to the February riots.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru questioned how Zee News got the documents, which even the accused did not have. “You [Zee News] take out documents from anybody, read it out and sensationalise the issue is not something that the court will countenance. These are documents which should not have been taken out and published,” Justice Bakhru said.

“The officers who have taken out [documents] are going to face vigilance inquiry. 19(1)(a) is not an unrivalled right in our country that has no limitations,” the judge remarked.

In India, press freedom is derived from Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, which guarantees to all its citizens the right to freedom of speech and expression.

Plea declined

The court also declined the plea of advocate Vijay Aggarwal, appearing for Zee News, who argued that pressing for disclosure of source would amount to interfering with the freedom of press.

The High Court’s direction came while hearing the plea of Mr. Tanha, who was aggrieved by various news reports appearing in electronic media that alleged that he had confessed to organising and inciting communal riots that occurred in north-east Delhi.

Mr. Tanha alleged that he was coerced by police officers to sign certain papers and make statements while in their custody. He contended that the alleged disclosure statements, which have become a subject matter of news reports, were not given voluntarily and are inadmissible as evidence in court.

Delhi Police had during the last hearing stated that the information about the disclosure statement of Mr. Tanha was not leaked by its officers. The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) in an affidavit had stated that Delhi Police was also “aggrieved” by the news report in which the alleged confessional statement of Mr. Tanha was leaked. The DCP had said that a vigilance inquiry had been instituted into the matter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-asks-zee-news-to-disclose-source-of-delhi-riots-report/article32896571.ece

“People from any part of the country should get a glimpse of an array of the cultural diversity symbolising India. The government is working fast to make Delhi a vibrant centre of art and culture,” he said.

“This has been a big dream. A cultural policy is being formulated to make it come true. For this, the Department of Art Culture and Languages ​​of the government of Delhi has constituted a 15-member committee advisory committee. It will submit its report within two months,” he also said.

The advisory committee consists of personalities and experts from the field of art and culture. These include actors Manoj Bajpayee and Javed Jaffrey, Art & Policy expert Pooja Sood, JNU’s School of Arts and Aesthetics Professor, Ira Bhaskar.

Similarly, music producer Breen Desai, art expert Abhinandita Dayal Mathur, artists and researchers Bhagwati Prasad and Latika Gupta, artist and educationist Aastha Chauhan are also a part of the committee.

“We do not want to restrict art and culture to mere events, but through it we have a dream to change our mindset. Artists have brought about major changes in the past and today, we expect a greater role from the people who represent this field,” he also said.

“The formulation of this cultural policy is an unprecedented step towards working and promoting the cultural landscape and history of our country.

Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Monday said that the odd-even vehicle rationing policy will be used as a “last weapon” if everything else fails in the fight against air pollution in the city.

The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram and Noida were in the ‘poor’ category on Monday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

“We have implemented the odd-even policy many times and it will be our last weapon. If everything else fails, then the government will think about implementing odd-even,” the Minister said during a press conference.

Mr. Rai further said the government will launch an awareness programme from October 21 about the “red light on, gaadi off” campaign to reduce air pollution.

“We will run the campaign from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. As many as 100 busy traffic intersections have been selected for the purpose. A total of 2,500 environment marshals will be deployed at these junctions,” he said, adding: People who are not turning off their vehicles at red lights will be given a rose and environment marshals will appeal to them to turn off their vehicles.”

Delhi’s AQI was 244 (poor) on Monday. The values for Gurugram and Noida were 245 and 236, respectively, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin on Monday, which is an average of the past 24 hours.

The AQI of Delhi is expected to be in the ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ category on Tuesday and is likely to worsen thereon, as per SAFAR.

“A change in surface wind direction is forecast by Wednesday, which is likely to bring on calm surface wind conditions leading to low ventilation and deterioration of AQI. ‘Very poor’ AQI is predicted for Wednesday and Thursday,” it added.

Meanwhile, the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority on Monday wrote to the Chief Secretaries of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to review emission standards of eight thermal power plants in the two States and inform them about it.

Closure of power plants

“We may have to direct closure of the plants, which do not meet 2015 standards as air quality deteriorates in the coming days,” the letter read.

The closure of the plantshas been a major demand of the Delhi government.

269,2020/10/20,HC questions Amanatullah’s appointment as Delhi Waqf Board chief,"Court questions govt. as to how can he be considered when he is facing charges of irregularities

The Delhi High Court on Monday questioned the city government as to how AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan can be allowed to be appointed as chairperson of the Waqf Board when he was facing allegations of irregularities.

A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad posed the query while hearing a plea seeking challenging a notification that called for a meeting of the elected Waqf Board members on Monday to elect one of them, including Mr Amanatullah, as the chairperson.

“Why should he [Mr. Amanatullah] be allowed to be part of the system when there are serious allegations against him,” the Bench asked.

Audit report

The High Court was hearing a petition by Mohd Iqbal Khan seeking quashing of the notification on the ground that if the AAP MLA is elected as chairperson, the report of a special audit initiated to look into allegations of irregularities against him would be placed before him.

Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Delhi government, said the Board has nothing to do with the special audit and its findings would go directly to the government.

Advocate K.C. Mittal, appearing for Mr. Khan, said that if his name is nominated by any of the board members, he can contest for the post. The court has listed the case for further hearing on November 9 after the ASG said the board meeting to elect a chairperson would be deferred till November 19.

The petitioner, who claims to be a social worker, said the notification calling for a meeting of the board members on October 19 was issued on October 7 and therefore, he did not have the time to move a representation to the authority concerned. He has alleged in his petition that there are also several criminal cases against the AAP MLA.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-questions-amanatullahs-appointment-as-delhi-waqf-board-chief/article32896033.ece

271,2020/10/20,DU’s second list admissions begin,"University approves 2,580 of 9,785 applications on Day 1

On the first day of admissions to merit-based undergraduate courses under the second cut-off list, Delhi University colleges received 9,785 applications out of which 2,580 applications were approved.

The second cut-off list, which was released on October 17, saw a minor dip in cut-offs for most courses with several colleges closing the list for geography, political science, psychology, Hindi and Sanskrit.

The admission process under the new list will continue till Wednesday. Students have time till Friday to complete the payment process.

They also have the option of cancelling or withdrawing their admissions and migrating to other colleges if they meet the cut-off criteria.

A cancellation fee of ₹1,000 will be charged.

Ramjas College principal Manoj Khanna said, “There were not many cancellations in our college. After the first list, we had 937 admissions. As of Monday evening, the total stands at 936. I have already approved 150 applications and the rest are at the department level. One issue is that we are receiving applications for courses that are already closed. We have informed the university about it.”

Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College principal Gyantosh Jha said around 100 applications were approved on Monday. “The only issue was that some aspirants with higher cut-offs were applying, which we had to reject as we cannot admit the first cut-off students under the second list,” said Mr. Jha.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ac6pfb/article32896023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19DELPRIYADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dus-second-list-admissions-begin/article32896024.ece
272,2020/10/20,Two die while cleaning septic tank in Azadpur,"Workers were not wearing safety gear; factory owner held

Two men died while cleaning a septic tank in north-west Delhi’s Azadpur, the police said on Monday.

On Sunday evening, information was received that three men had fallen unconscious while cleaning a septic tank in a factory in G-Block, Azadpur. Fire officials sent four fire tenders to the spot to rescue the men.

During preliminary enquiry, it was found that the factory — located in G.T. Karnal Road industrial area in Bada Bagh Delhi — manufactures gold and silver chains, and stored various diluted chemicals, used in the process, in a large septic tank.

Engaged for ₹400 each

The tender for cleaning the tank was given by factory owner Rajender Soni to contractor Pramod Dangi (35), a resident of Najafgarh, a senior officer said.

A case has been registered. Mr. Soni and Mr. Dangi have been arrested. The labourers were not wearing any safety gears and had been engaged for ₹400 each, said DCP (North-West) Vijayanta Arya.

“When seven persons were cleaning the tank, two became unconscious. They were taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital where Idris, 45, and Salim, 45, both residents of Khurja in Uttar Pradesh, were declared brought dead,” said the police officer.

Abdul Saddam, 35, Salim, 35, and Mansoor, 38, were treated and later discharged.

273,2020/10/20,‘No leader or officer has visited our area’,"Anger over delayed govt. response simmering among Barkas residents

It has been a harrowing experience for the residents of Barkas, especially those living south of the Gurram Cheruvu bund, following the lake bund breach.

Residents of Hamshan Colony, Ali Gulshan Colony and Sayeed Colony say when the waters rose as rains lashed the city last Tuesday night, alarm bells went off. By Wednesday, without warning, water gushed into the neighbourhoods. This Tuesday, almost a week later, help was yet to arrive.

Unbearable stench

“I called leaders so many times and there has been no response. No government officer has come to take stock of the situation. All you can see are four or five GHMC sanitation workers who are trying to clear the muck off the roads. What can only four or five people do? The stench here is unbearable,” said Ali bin Abdallah, a resident of the area, even as he points to bags of spoiled rice, wet and soiled mattresses, adding that a large number of residents are daily wage earners.

Later in the day, a couple of trucks arrived, and began clearing slush and mud. The simmering anger over a delayed response among the locals was palpable. When the waters rose, they only had each other’s help.

TJ workers on the job

A short distance away, Tablighi Jamaat (TJ) workers, wearing latex gloves and armed with mops, were seen clearing properties of muck.

“The Mallepally Markaz asked us to come here to clean houses. So far, we must have cleaned 100 houses,” said a man who identified himself as Waris, a TJ worker.

There are two educational institutions on both sides of the road — the Madrasa-e-Ilahia, which imparts religious education, and the Al Qarmoshi Global School, which prepares students for Secondary School Certificate exams.

“Our school recognition and extension of recognition certificates are damaged. Old records have been washed away. What will we do now,” asked Mohammed Abdul Raheem Al Qarmoshi, who has been teaching at the school for over 20 years.

Masood bin Abdul Raheem from the madrassa on the other side of the slush covered road asks something similar. “We are still waiting for help from leaders and baldiya (GHMC) officials. Our religious books are drenched as the water here reached over 5 feet hight,” he said.

274,2020/10/20,Hopes pinned on opening of lake’s sluice gate,"‘We had built our home with all our savings, we cannot build it again’

It has been a week since torrential rains on October 13 inundated several localities in and around Hyderabad, including hundreds of homes in Uma Maheshwar Colony, Kompally. The colony runs alongside Fox Sagar Lake.

On Tuesday, scores of people came to see the efforts of experts to open sluice gate of the lake to send excess water into nalas. The efforts have been on for the past three days. Among those waiting a few metres from the work site were residents of the colony who are holding on to hope of the gate opening at the earliest so that the flood water recedes, allowing them to return to their homes.

“It was at 11 p.m. last Tuesday that water level rose rapidly in a span of half hour and inundated our homes. We collected whatever we could and ran to safer places,” recalled V. Rameshwari, who waited for more than four hours hoping for the gate to open.

Earlier flood

She and others from the locality alleged that water had flooded their colony six years ago, although not a major one, but no corrective measures were taken then. As she started walking back, more people were headed towards the site where the team of experts was working.

On the path leading to the sluice gate, a row of 14 shanties built on the banks of the lake are submerged. The smell of fish still emanates from thermocol boxes lying alongside the path. Around 14 families who rely on fishing started living in those shanties three years ago.

One among them, B. Panduraju, said that when the water level started to rise last Tuesday night, they shifted some belongings out of their home. “But we had to leave when the water reached chest level. Our fishing nets worth ₹5-6 lakh were swept away into the lake. Now, we have to start from scratch, but we don’t know how will we do it,” Mr Panduraju said.

Satya, an elderly woman who also lives there, said they did not eat for two days after water submerged their homes. She hopes for some compensation to get back to their routine.

Pouring her heart out, Ms Rameshwari, who along with her husband and two children shifted to their relative’s home in Quthbullapur, said, “Will the wooden furniture and most other things be usable after they have remained in water for seven days? We have lost all hopes. We had built our home with all our savings; we cannot build it again. We only wish that the walls of our building are intact. People say the house is on land which encroaching the lake. If government officials had not given us the permission, we would not have built it there.”

After the inundation, they managed to find a safe roof only because her relative D. Sharadha shifted from the colony to another locality after the minor flooding six years ago.

Quthbullapur MLA K.P. Vivekananda flagged the rumours of a breach being made to the lake as false. Experts from Nagarjuna Sagar dam and Srisailam dam were on the job of opening the sluice gate. He, along with Cyberabad Police Commissioner V.C. Sajjanar inspected the works at the gate on Tuesday, and said that water from the sluice gate will be sent into nalas and that it won’t pose a problem to low-lying areas.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/u49bfl/article32904027.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20-3FIXSAGARLAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hopes-pinned-on-opening-of-lakes-sluice-gate/article32904018.ece

276,2020/10/20,Flood victims return to ramshackle homes,"Financial aid from govt. enticing them to go back despite risk of house collapse

Flood victims of several colonies in Chandrayangutta have begun to return to their dank homes, braving the possibility of collapse any time. Musty walls, sludge and vegetation knee deep on streets, soggy mattresses and pillows, and rotten rations are greeting them and reminding them of the mountainous work ahead before they can resume normal lives.

Minister K.T.Rama Rao’s appeal to the residents of flood-affected areas to stay in the relief camps set up by the government has found no takers here. Mr. Rama Rao, during a press conference, cautioned about weakening of the flood-soaked structures, and urged the residents to move to relief camps.

Helpless and clueless

“Where are the relief camps? We do not know about any relief camp. Nobody has come to tell us, nor has volunteered to take us there. We are waiting in the hope of receiving financial assistance announced by the government,” says Md. Iqbal, a resident of Kabgir Nagar Colony near Falaknuma.

Escaping the flood-ravaged colony, he moved to his relatives’ house in another locality close by along with his wife, parents, brother and sister-in-law, after sending the four children in the family to his in-laws’ place.

“For how many days can we stay in relatives’ home? It will be a burden for them too to feed six of us,” he says.

The entire family is presently engaged in cleaning the house.

Reports are arriving from Omar Colony of Hafiz Baba Nagar, Royal Colony in Balapur, Hashamabad in Chandrayangutta, Nimrah Colony in Falaknuma, Ali Nagar in Mylardevpally, Talabkatta Chacha Garage, and Dhobi Ghat in Yakutpura, that several families are returning to their decrepit homes, many of which are nothing but walls and asbestos roof.

Financial help announced by the government is one more enticement for them to return, informed local volunteers.

Volunteers step in

While no official or politician has visited them so far, philanthropists and youth activists are streaming in with food and other necessities. “If not for them, we would have been in dire straits. All our utensils have been washed away, and the ration is rotten. We are penniless and not in a condition to find work either,” says Mr.Iqbal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/5s9m6r/article32903997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21BABANAGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/flood-victims-return-to-ramshackle-homes/article32903991.ece

A white paper on ‘Post-Covid imperatives for Hyderabad IT industry’ is to be launched at the summit.

278,2020/10/20,"Water rises in flooded locality, so does fear","Fresh rain spell adds to misery of residents of Nadeem Colony

Dead rats, sewage, plastic waste, muck and vehicles covered with sludge continue to line the streets of Vali Colony, Meraj St and other areas of Nadeem Colony on the northern side of the Golconda Fort.

“This is the biggest flood since 2008,” says Dastgir, who vacated his house and moved to his relatives’ place. “We were evacuated by a boat after two days of the flooding,” informs Azghar, a businessman, who moved to his sister’s house in Bandlaguda. “I sent my wife to her parents’ place and I stayed back to ensure thieves or vandals don’t raid the house,” says Hanif, who works with an IT major in Gachibowli.

The red alert on Tuesday kept the remaining residents on tenterhooks and their fears came true as water rose again after the afternoon rain spell. “We had to walk in the dirty water to reach my grandmother’s house. I was not scared but there were children who were screaming in darkness,” remembers Ayaz, a degree student, who moved to Grammar Colony during the flood of October 14.

It’s been 10 days since quite a few residents of Nadeem Colony were forced to move out of their homes and stay with relatives and friends, and wait for the water to recede in their locality. “This colony has the Shah Hatim Talab on the other side. They are releasing sewage from Banjara Hills, Paramount Colony, Hakimpet and Shaikept through the nala. The outlet into the lake is narrow, that’s why this flood water is not draining,” says Dastgir, who built one of the first houses in the locality in 2002.

Moving out of their homes and putting up at their relatives’ is not something new for residents of Nadeem Colony. While the havoc wrought by the 2008, 2009, 2011, 2014 flooding is well known, Nadeem Colony makes news every monsoon for all the wrong reasons. “It was never this bad. There is no water or electricity even after so many days. People are giving us food and we are lighting candles in the night,” says Shaikh Idris, a cancer patient, who climbed to the first floor as water swirled inside the ground floor of his house in the locality.

After the State government announced relief measures, including dry rations and cash, NGOs and community leaders are reaching out to collect details from the residents. But a large number of residents have moved out of the area temporarily as they usually do during flooding in the area.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ow4rbg/article32903980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20-2NADEEMCOLONY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/water-rises-in-flooded-locality-so-does-fear/article32903974.ece
279,2020/10/20,Rescue rain-hit ryots: Cong.,"The Congress party has requested the Telangana and Central governments to come to the rescue of the farming community that has been facing nature’s fury in the form of excessive rain in the State, causing extensive damage to standing crops.

In the absence of insurance coverage to crops following a dispute between the State and Central governments over bearing the share of premium amount, the farmers were not in a position to get any compensation, senior legislator and former minister T. Jeevan Reddy said on Tuesday. Only the reimbursement of cultivation costs at ₹20,000 per acre could alone bring the farmers out of the present crisis as the prospects of crop production had gone down to one-third of normal/expected quantity.

Mr. Jeevan Reddy, who also addressed a letter to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the hand-holding needed by the farming community during the present crisis, requested the State government to conduct a field survey on the damage suffered by standing crops, including cotton, paddy, maize etc. without any delay as some farmers were taking up harvesting with the hope of getting at least something.

Further, he sought relaxations of fair average quality specifications for cotton procurement by the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) so that some relief was provided to the farming community in distress. On maize, he said instead of blaming one another, the State and Central governments should come forward to procure maize at minimum support price of ₹1,850 per quintal as the Centre’s decision to allow imported maize with reduced duty had hit the market price to around ₹1,000 per quintal only.

Meanwhile, legislator T. Jayaprakash Reddy alias Jagga Reddy alleged that the State administration had completely given up on providing relief to rain/flood-hit people in Hyderabad and elsewhere in the State as they appeared to be more interested in conducting reviews on non-priority issues in the present context such as Dharani portal for registration of non-agricultural properties.

He pointed out that farmers had taken to large-scale cultivation of paddy and cotton on the advice of the government and it was the responsibility of the administration to procure the two crops by relaxing quality norms. He also criticised the government for offering ₹10,000, ₹50,000 and ₹1 lakh to people who had lost everything in floods in the city.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rescue-rain-hit-ryots-cong/article32903967.ece

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has contributed ₹15 crore to the CMRF while the West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee announced ₹2 crore for taking up relief and rehabilitation works in the flood affected areas.

Mr. Kejriwal and Ms. Banerjee asserted that their governments would stand by the Telangana government in its efforts to provide relief to the affected families. Ms. Banerjee recalled how her State had suffered immense losses on account of cyclone Amphan in May this year. She said: “we can feel the sufferings that the people of your State are going through and our heart goes out to them.”

Mr. Rao called the three Chief Ministers over telephone and thanked them personally for their generous gesture and the cooperation extended. In addition to politicians, representatives from the industry, films and other too announced their contributions to the CMRF.

My Home Group has announced contribution of ₹5 crore while another construction major Aparna Constructions and Estates Limited has donated ₹6 crore. From the film industry, film stars Chiranjeevi, Mahesh Babu and Prabhas announced contributions of ₹1 crore each and NTR Junior and Nagarjuna ₹50 lakh each.

Director Trivikram Srinivas, actor Vijay Devarakonda and film production firm Harika Hasini Creations announced ₹10 lakh each. Minister K.T.

Chandrasekhar Rao’s announcement that the government was committed to go to the rescue of the poor who suffered miseries because of the heavy rain that hit the city after more than a century. The Chief Minister accordingly announced a series of measures that would be initiated by the Municipal Administration & Urban Development Department (MAUD) and this was immediately followed by release of ₹550 crore to the Municipal Administration department to start relief works in the right earnest.

According to the orders issued late on Monday evening, the government had set a deadline of seven days for the officials concerned to ensure that problems in the affected areas were redressed so that life returned to normalcy in these areas. The GHMC commissioner had been asked to constitute three-member inter-departmental teams comprising Special officer, GHMC official and Revenue/other department officials locality wise.

Enumeration for distribution of relief amount should cover all the inundated houses without any omission covering such localities including slums and other such areas severely impacted by the rains. Special care should be taken to ensure that individual/group of houses which belong to the poor, slums, areas belonging to the vulnerable sections and other such deserving sections which were impacted due to rains were covered.

Distribution of the relief amount should be done at the doorstep of the affected families and would be done through an App that would capture the Geo-coordinates of the family concerned and its details which would cover relevant details including Aadhaar numbers. The government had decided to involve public representatives in the distribution of the relief material and officials had been directed to ensure that there was no duplication in distribution and that each family would get the relief only once. Officials should take adequate care to ensure that acknowledgment was obtained from the concerned head of family and this would be counter signed by the three officers to avoid duplication.

The same procedure should be adopted in the other urban local bodies which were affected by the heavy rain/flood with the constitution of teams of three officials each by the district collector in consultation with the municipal authorities concerned. The Chief Minister reviewed with senior officials the situation arising out of the incessant rains that resulted in inundation of many low-lying areas during the last week resulting in displacement of people and damage to civic infrastructure in the GMC and other urban local bodies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabad-rains-maud-to-enumerate-losses-incurred-due-to-floods-within-a-week/article32898158.ece
285,2020/10/20,A global coming out song,"Shayan Italia’s video ‘Sha La La’ demonstrates how creativity transcends boundaries

Just when you think you have seen the best of the lockdown music productions, there comes another one demanding attention. To mark International Coming Out Day (October 11), India-born British pianist, singer and songwriter Shayan Italia has released his second video, ‘Sha La La’, a ‘Hinglish’ (Hindi and English) single with 65 artistes to drive the message ‘love without boundaries’. “I’ve never looked at the world by country, religion, caste or culture. There are no borders for me in creativity,” explains Shayan.

Excerpts from an interview:

Was the song influenced by Carpenters and Vengaboys ?

The Carpenters definitely. ‘Yesterday Once More’ is a classic and one of my late mum’s favourites. My purpose of creating ‘Sha La La’ was that not only must it be relevant in today’s age, but also audio-visually bring something thought-provokingly fresh and insightful to the world of new-age Indian pop music, which I believe, if steered in the right direction, could acquire a global audience like mainstream Spanish music has today.

Can Sha la la be called a lockdown production? or has this been conceived before the pandemic?

Sha La La is a mammoth production for a music video in today’s social media era (even when compared with any big Indian movie song for that matter). The song was conceived many years ago. It was brought to life as a commercial Hindi-English track in the last 2 years with me recording the song in end 2018, Sept, shooting the video exactly one year later in end-Sept 2019, and launching the video exactly one year after that in early-Oct 2020. Within this time It has been carefully developed to what it is today. A lot of thought has been gone into every stage of its creation. I like to live with things to know if they can truly stand the test of time. If you see this video in 5 years it should still look and sound stunning; then we’ve kind-of-done our job!

Did you have any apprehension before finalising the storyboard that contained sensuous visuals?

Muni Agarwal, the video’s director, and I lived with the storyboard for nine months before taking it to the floor to shoot the video. If you access the concept page of the ‘Sha La La’ website, you will understand exactly how the storyboard flows in six distinct parts. I have always written songs or made videos on what feels right to me; I have never considered public opinion. To me the ideology of “Love Without Boundaries” is a universal one.

Do share how the large team of creatives, technicians and artists have come together for this project.

The song was recorded at some of the world’s best studios [where I have been recording since I was a boy. These include Air, Metropolis, Abbey Road etc in London. I tend to record certain parts in certain studios to get a specific sound. I also like recording some parts to tape and then converting it digitally. The Hindi vocals were recorded at Purple Haze studios in Mumbai, [and on a ribbon mic might I add. which is very difficult to sing into]. The music features a plethora of legendary talent whose contribution to the international music industry is unquantifiable. I personally mastered the track using analogue equipment. I cannot stand how some new-age stuff is mastered. It is so loud and deafening, even at lower volumes! Music for me has to possess dynamics.

The video features ace production house Benetone Films with local talent from Mumbai. It was shot in Bangkok, Thailand. A lot of recce and casting work was done remotely, then on-ground before the video was shot. It was a very intensive back-to-back three-day shoot. The 21-strong cast makes it a truly international project. This again was very important for me to achieve with this song.

What memories do you have of Hyderabad/Secunderabad from your childhood?

I came from a simple Parsi family in Secunderabad and was fortunate that when I was a boy, I had my brother, most of my cousins, aunts and uncles all staying in the same city. So every Sunday when the family would meet, like any other Parsi family, the energy was kind of like a zoo! Values were the real ethos imbibed in us all and doing the ‘right thing’ over what was convenient. I find if you are driven by purpose you lead a more fulfilling life than if you are driven by vanity metrics.

How did losing parents early in life impact you?

I lost my mum when I was just a boy and my dad exactly one year after to Multiple Myeloma and Multiple Sclerosis respectively. Overnight both brothers had to grow up. Life without the guidance of one’s parents, is infinitely more difficult, especially when you navigate in the social world of today. Even women perceive you differently when they find out you are, well an orphan of sorts. I do miss them both. But in a way I’ve made them part of me in the way I live: travel, music, health, food, fitness, reading, movies, technology… it’s a 50/50 split of each in me.

Having lost parents to diseases, I lead a healthy lifestyle and this has also led me to create my up-and-coming flagship wellness app which launches later in the year. My love for technology and efficiency stems from my dad as he was a PhD in Engineering who graduated from IIT Ahmedabad. My mum lived in books, having read thousands in her life; I guess the creative side of me stems from her.

What took you to London?

My elder brother was in London at the time. After I lost my parents, I ended up there under his care. In fact my brother has been my brother, mum, dad, sole-confidant and I’m truly nothing without him. Every introduction, every break, every support has come from or through him. Also a few of my first cousins were living in London at the time so it made sense to go there. I live in Mumbai now as I believe there is space for change in India. Who knows, maybe ‘Sha La La’ could grow to be that small bit of change.

Any inclination towards Bollywood?

I believe I could contribute to an Indian film in setting a theme or song that would resonate with the audience, with its melody broken down into various parts throughout the film [like the theme of Titanic]. For now, my focus is on growing ‘Sha La La’ and launching a wellness app soon. But if a big production house wanted, I would definitely explore the opportunity. It just can’t be conventional. I don’t do conventional.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/qwa1ab/article32900551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym21Shayan-Italiajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/shayan-italias-video-sha-la-la-is-a-global-coming-out-song/article32900554.ece

Of the 644 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Ernakulam on Tuesday, the source of infection of 190 patients remains untraced. As many as 438 people contracted the infection through local contact.

Four health workers were among the infected.

287,2020/10/20,ITMS a feather on cap of Kochi’s transport system: CM,"Actuated signal system readied at 21 important junctions in the city

The ₹27-crore Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) to streamline traffic movement and to aid in rule enforcement in the Greater Kochi area was yet another feather on the cap of Kochi’s transport system, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, after inaugurating the system online on Monday.

The taking effect of the Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) and the expected commissioning of the Water Metro (in January 2021) would take ahead the cause of seamless mobility in the region, which already has metro rail, private bus companies and an autorickshaw cooperative society to be proud of. That the tech-based ITMS relied on night-vision cameras would ensure rule enforcement round-the-clock and irrespective of the weather, said the Chief Minister.

An initiative of Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML), Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation (Keltron) installed high resolution CCTVs and other equipment needed for the project. Automated enforcement will help identify traffic-dense corridors and vehicles moving in that direction will be given preference, by relying on data gathered by radars. It will also enable automated rule enforcement. For instance, motorists who jump red signal will be automatically challaned and will have to remit fine. The actuated signal system has been readied at 21 important junctions while pedestrian-operated pelican signals are there at half a dozen busy roads. Red-light jumping detection cameras are there at 35 junctions. All these will be monitored from the centralised monitoring and command centre at Revenue Tower. Keltron will have to ensure upkeep of cameras and allied infrastructure for a period of five years.

Mr. Vijayan also unveiled CSML’s e-health solutions project, a joint initiative of Central and State governments, which will store data on patients among a host of other functions. The Ernakulam General Hospital is among the eight government hospitals that will be covered under this. He stated that all CSML initiatives were tailor-made to improve the quality of life of citizens.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/g5xp3n/article32897623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201019-WA0059,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/itms-a-feather-on-cap-of-kochis-transport-system-cm/article32897625.ece
288,2020/10/20,Air cargo movement via Kochi hit as new curbs come into effect,"DGCA restricts operation of foreign, non-scheduled freight services to six airports

Air cargo movement via the Cochin International Airport here has been curtailed and export of mostly perishable items such as vegetables and fruits hit after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) restricted the operation of foreign ad hoc and pure chartered, non-scheduled freight services to six airports in the country.

There were no airports in Kerala being allowed to handle special cargo flights or ad hoc flights to move cargo with effect from October 1, following the DGCA order, said airport sources. The special cargo flight services will be available only from Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

Most of the cargo operations via Kochi was handled till now by foreign airlines, especially those from the Middle East as most of the export items were headed for markets in those countries. The bulk of the cargo comprised fruits and vegetables as well as seasonal items.

While the airport handled between 100 and 150 tonnes of cargo per day during the pre-COVID days, the volume came down significantly after the pandemic restrictions came into effect. But with easing of business activities in several countries, cargo volumes were picking up when the new restrictions have come into effect.

CIAL handled 1,564 tonnes of cargo between September 1 and September 15, but the volume came down by around 500 tonnes to 1,044 tonnes between October 1 and 15, said airport sources.

Air cargo movement via Kochi is now handled using passenger flights. However, passenger flights carry up to 15 tonnes of cargo while special flights meant solely for freight can carry up to 50 tonnes. The new restriction means that exporters of fruits and vegetables will have to ship their consignments to the nearest airport where dedicated cargo flights are available.

Meanwhile, with COVID-19 restrictions still in place in the air transport sector, CIAL is handling just about a tenth of the flights it handled during normal times. The number of flights handled by the airport had come down to 20 to 25 a day, from the normal levels of over 240 flights per day, the sources added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/onbiyt/article31073806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOCHIAIRPORTKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/air-cargo-movement-via-kochi-hit-as-new-curbs-come-into-effect/article32896486.ece
289,2020/10/20,"Migrant workers’ leader abducted, assaulted","A leader of Progressive Workers’ Federation who played a key role in organising workers from other States who are employed in different firms in Perumbavoor was abducted on Sunday and brutally assaulted at a scrap godown in the area.

“I lost consciousness after I was hit on the head from behind, when I was with workers at a colony in Perumbavoor,” said George Mathew, who was assaulted reportedly by a trader’s henchmen. He said he found himself at the godown when he regained consciousness. He was admitted to the Ernakulam General Hospital and discharged on Monday.

Mr. Mathew, who has been active among workers here since 2006, said the attack might have been triggered by his organisation taking up the cause of a worker whose palm was severed in an accident at a manufacturing unit in Perumbavoor. His organisation had taken up the matter with the Labour Department, seeking compensation from the owner.

The Perumbavoor police said a case was registered and the statements of people were being recorded.

Protesting against the abduction and assault, human rights activists and socio-political leaders will organise a demonstration in Perumbavoor on Tuesday. “I will formally lodge a complaint with the police on Tuesday,” said Mr. Mathew.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/migrant-workers-leader-abducted-assaulted/article32896483.ece
290,2020/10/20,Dhwani to ensure safe berthing of vessels at Beypore Port,"Facility gets new large tugboat worth ₹3.2 crore

A new large tugboat, Dhwani, has started operating at Beypore Port for facilitating the safe berthing of mercantile vessels and ensuring speedy cargo movement. The port, which was struggling in the absence of such a towing boat, finally got it as a result of efforts by a few prominent importers, traders’ forums and government officials.

In the absence of the tugboat, large cargo vessel operators were seemingly disinclined to frequent Beypore Port and cooperate with business promotion activities. Many a time, smaller boats were used for unloading goods from large cargo ships anchored several metres away from the port. With the arrival of the new tug, the towing job or escort would be easy.

Crew exchange

Functionaries of the Calicut Chamber of Commerce and Industry said they had submitted several memoranda to Union and State Ministers for sanctioning a larger tug as it was crucial for facilitating even the crew exchange of container vessels. They pointed out that some of the international shipping companies handling oil containers had already expressed their interest in doing the crew exchange from Beypore.

Officials said the 450-HP Dhwani had a superior echo radar system, VHF, echo sounder, GPS and Automatic Identification Systems.

The offshore tug was built in Goa Shipyard at a cost of ₹3.2 crore. It was sanctioned for Kozhikode as part of the ongoing shipping promotion programmes of Union and State governments, they said.

Though Beypore had a tug named M.T. Malabar, which was introduced in 2015 for streamlining cargo movement, it offered service only for a limited period.

It was later taken to the Kollam port, and no other replacement was made citing financial constraints. With the arrival of the new boat, the Zamorin Tug which was not in service for years due to mechanical failures would be dismantled soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/9twt7j/article32895990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201013-WA0052,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/dhwani-to-ensure-safe-berthing-of-vessels-at-beypore-port/article32895991.ece
291,2020/10/20,Renovated Kozhikode district panchayat building inaugurated,"Minister opens office building, auditorium

Minister for Excise and Labour T.P. Ramakrishnan on Monday said the Kozhikode district panchayat had set a model in the implementation of welfare schemes with the cooperation of local bodies under it. It was evident during the pandemic when the local bodies played a vital role in setting up first-line treatment centres and their management. The Minister was inaugurating the renovated district panchayat office and the new auditorium here.

“Now, there is also a praiseworthy effort on the part of the panchayat authorities to ensure a smooth transition of power as their five-year administrative term is nearing completion. There may be political differences, but elected representatives have the responsibility to adopt steps like this for showing their commitment to the electorate,” he said.

District panchayat president Babu Parassery, who presided over the event, said the completion of the new auditorium was a big achievement. “We were in a situation to depend on private auditoriums for hosting our own meetings. It became a reality as we could earmark funds for it in different phases,” he said.

The district panchayat spent ₹1.15 crore for the renovation of the building and the construction of the 300-seater auditorium. The work was done by the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society. A roof-top solar power plant, generator backup, better comfort stations and lifts are among the new facilities at the building.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/19vhrj/article28791663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tvgad02-excisGMS53R8F63jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/renovated-kozhikode-district-panchayat-building-inaugurated/article32895971.ece
292,2020/10/20,Youth murdered in Keeraithurai,"Madurai

A 20-year-old youth, P. Bharathiraja of Sivaganga district was hacked to death at Kanaga Pillai Street here on Tuesday morning.

The police said that the youth was part of a team involved in sinking borewells. While he was at work, an armed gang barged into the place and hacked him to death.

The Keeraithurai police have got some video footage on the accused and were trying to identify them. The motive for the murder was yet to be ascertained.

Bid to murder

Meanwhile, a murder case accused was hacked at his house in M. Puliyankulam under Villur police station limits on Sunday late night.

The police said that K. Arumugam (35) was one of the accused in the murder of one K. Karuppaiah in June. The accused who was in Central Prison came out on bail on September 17.

While he was sleeping in his house with his family members, an armed gang barged into his house and attacked him with lethal weapons.

He was admitted to Government hospital in Virudhunagar.

Villur police have arrested two persons, A. Veeramuthu (30) and R. Nagarajan (27) of Mottamalai.

293,2020/10/20,‘Dalit girl takes own life after elders scuttle intercaste marriage’,"Minor husband disowned marriage under parental pressure: NGO

Madurai

A 19-year-old girl from a Scheduled Caste (SC) community in Dharmapuri district died by suicide after her 90-day-old marriage with a Vanniyar groom, a minor, ended after his parents forcibly took him away to an undisclosed destination, activists said.

The issue came to light only now after a fact-finding team from ‘Evidence’, an NGO working for the cause of the downtrodden, from Madurai visited the hamlet and interacted with the victim’s family and relatives.

Speaking to The Hindu, Evidence Executive Director A. Kathir said on Tuesday that the developments had taken place between February and October 2020. “It was unfortunate that the authorities had not followed the Supreme Court’s guidelines [on protecting inter-caste couples from persecution]. Failure to adhere to the norms had claimed the life of an innocent Dalit girl, he added.

The girl’s grandparents explained to the team members the ordeal faced by the victim before she died, Mr. Kathir said.

Even after the 18-year-old boy was taken away by her relatives, the girl managed to trace him and when she pleaded that they could live together, her husband had turned down the idea. Unable to accept the rejection, the girl consumed poison and, after battling for about a fortnight, she died in the Government Hospital, Dharmapuri on October 2.

A police officer investigating the case said the FIR had been altered to one of ‘abetment of suicide’ under Section 306 of the IPC. It also invokes provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015.

The team members say the police did not produce the couple before a Juvenile Board. On the other hand, they allowed the boy’s family to handle the issue. The team members said the village elders had assembled and directed the girl’s family to accept money as ‘compensation’. These acts were against Supreme Court guidelines, and also claimed the girl’s life, they said.

Narrating the victim’s plight, her grandfather Srinivasan (65) said he had brought her up since the girl's mother died soon after her birth. Unfortunately, the girl's father married another woman and went away, forcing the grandfather to raise her.

In a small hamlet Kaarimangalam, under the care of her grandparents, the girl studied in a local school. After she fell in love with the boy from the locality, they married in a local temple on February 2, 2020, and lived together in different locations, including at a dwelling in Samathuvapuram for about three months, the team members said.

However, the boy's parents, who were frantically searching for him, found him finally and whisked him away to an undisclosed destination in June. They reportedly threatened the girl to go home and live with her grandparents and insisted that she forget the boy and the marriage.

Shocked, the girl lodged a complaint with the Kambainallur police station in August 2020. However, instead of inquiring into it, the police is said to have asked the girl to appear before the villagers for a “peaceful” settlement between the two families. The meeting of elders, at which the girl and her grandparents were present amidst a risk to her life, directed the girl to accept money as the verdict and start a new life.

Following this, she consumed poison and remained unconscious, Mr. Kathir said. Her grandparents rushed her to the GH on September 16, where the end came on October 2, he said.

As the news of the death reached the police, the boy was arrested and produced before the Juvenile Board, which directed him to be kept in a Correctional Home, Mr. Kathir said and added that the State government should take stern action against the police for negligence, and arrest the family members of the boy.

The grandparents should be given a compensation of ₹ 25 lakh and monthly pension of ₹10,000, the team members said.

294,2020/10/20,‘Lockdown led to decline in breast cancer patients seeking treatment’,"Madurai

Doctors of Meenakshi Mission Hospital said that there was a sharp decline in the number of breast cancer patients seeking treatment in the initial five months of the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown as people avoided visiting healthcare facilities due to the fear of contracting the virus and because of travel restrictions.

Delayed treatment has a serious impact on morbidity and mortality of breast cancer patients, said K.S. Kirushna Kumar, Head, Radiation Oncology.

“A section of people reached healthcare facilities for treatment through their private transport. However, people from lower economic families could not seek treatment due to the absence of public transport,” he said.

Krishnakumar Rathnam, Senior Consultant, Medical Oncology, said that COVID-19 does not directly impact the health condition of breast cancer patients. But those undergoing chemotherapy have low immunity, increasing the risk of infection, he added.

Awareness of breast cancer is still lower in the country, resulting in delayed diagnosis, said R. Vijayabhaskar, Senior Consultant, Surgical Oncology.

“While only around 35% of the breast cancer patients get diagnosed in stages 1 and 2, nearly 50% of the patients get diagnosed in stage 3. This is in contrast to the western countries where 95% of the breast cancer patients get diagnosed in stages 1 and 2,” he said.

Dr. Rathnam said that breast cancer cases were increasing and even younger women were also affected.

If breast cancer is diagnosed at an earlier stage, then it is easily curable, said Dr. Vijayabhaskar. “Every woman who is aged above 40 must get screened once every year,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/lockdown-led-to-decline-in-breast-cancer-patients-seeking-treatment/article32902500.ece

297,2020/10/20,A magazine into the world of transgender community,"It is expected to break stereotypes, stigma associated with it

Madurai

'Trans News', an online magazine for transgender people, will break stereotypes and stigma associated with the community. It will enlighten the public on the right information about transgenders by focussing on their lives, aspirations, love and celebrations, says its Chief Editor and Chairperson of Transgender Resource Centre Priya Babu.

It is India’s first e-magazine for the transgender community and the first issue of this monthly magazine will be launched on November 1, says Ms. Babu. All models to be featured in the magazine are from the transgender community.

The magazine, published by the Transgender Resource Centre, will initially be available in English and Tamil languages. “We are planning to have the Hindi version of the magazine after two months,” she says.

This magazine will have book reviews, stories on health, religion, trans literature, cooking tips, food recipes and success stories of transgender people. Apart from essays, there will also be video explainers on important topics.

There will be a separate segment known as 'Shop' , where the products manufactured by the transgender people are displayed for sale. “We started this segment as there are many talented transwomen and transmen who are unable to access a suitable platform to sell their products,” says Ms. Babu.

There will also be a segment where job offers that are available for transgender people will be displayed.

“Most of the photographs of the magazine will be taken by our team,” says one of the magazine’s Assistant Editors D. Samuel Sundar.

The team has three transwomen reporters - R. Jeeva, Padmini Prakash and Viji- who mainly contribute stories for the magazine.

The entertainment media falsely portrays all transwomen as sex workers and those seeking alms for their livelihoods, says Ms. Prakash.

“But, there are many educated and talented transwomen who are working hard to become successful in their chosen career fields,” she says.

All these stereotypes associated with the transgender community can be changed only if their true stories come out to the public, adds Ms. Prakash.

“But, there is very less space available in the mainstream media to speak about the issues of transgender people. So, through the 'Trans News' magazine, we will bring out all aspects of the lives of transgender community,” she adds.

There will also be stories focussing on the violence endured by the transgender community, says Ms. Jeeva.

Subash Pandithurai, Aadya Kashyap and M. Akash Velraj, who are all second year undergraduate students of The American College, are part of the core team of the magazine.

“The public's opinion about the transgender community will completely change after they read the magazine. They will come to know about the talented the transgender community,” says Mr. Pandithurai.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/7ipofg/article32901776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA21TRANSGENDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/a-magazine-into-the-world-of-transgender-community/article32901777.ece
298,2020/10/20,Use of banned purse seine nets has Kanniyakumari fishermen up in arms,"‘Since this fishing practice is like scooping, even fingerlings are not spared’

Following the Thoothukudi country boat fishermen, the fishermen in Kanniyakumari have raised a banner of revolt against the use of purse seine nets by a section of fishers in the district saying the use of the banned fishnet would “destroy marine wealth including fingerlings”.

After venturing into the sea in two country boats – the first one occupied by the fishermen and the other one loaded with the purse seine nets – the fishermen, on reaching the spot for fishing, would release the net into the sea from the boat in the form of a large circle (apparently with 15 or 20 meter diameter).

While the boat with the fishermen would be stationed at a point, the craft with the purse seine would be moved slowly even as a fisherman would release the net into the sea. As the moving boat with fishnet would reach the starting point – i.e. near the stationary boat – the fishnet would have been released into the sea in the form of a circle. After a few minutes, the released net would be dragged back to the boat manually with the fishes entangled in it.

“Since this fishing practice is like scooping, it won’t even spare the fingerlings and hence the government banned this fishnet which is still being used by a few fishermen here. So we appeal to the district administration to strictly enforce the ban on using these nets,” says Antony, president of Marthandanthurai Fishermen Cooperative Society Limited.

Mr. Antony, who has forwarded a complaint to the Kanniyakumari District Collector in this connection, says fishermen from a few villages near Kollencode are using the banned purse seine net.

Endorsing the views of Mr. Antony, president of Vallavilai Fishermen Cooperative Society P. Arulanandan says a few fishermen from Neerodi, a coastal hamlet situated on the Tamil Nadu – Kerala border, were using the purse seine nets posing serious threat to the marine wealth. “More importantly, these banned nets pose a serious challenge to the livelihood of catamaran and shore-net fishermen. Hence, the officials should take appropriate action against the fishermen using the banned fishnets,” Mr. Arulanandan says.

However, fishermen using the purse seine nets defend their practice.

“The purse seine nets are like ‘mani valai’ (cast net) being used by the inland fishermen while fishing in the reservoirs. Venturing into the sea only in country boats, we don’t use bottom trawling nets as being used by the mechanized boats, which are being constructed nowadays in violation of the norms in length and hauled by engines with higher capacity up to 450 horse power while they are allowed to fit only engines with 120 HP capacity. We release and take back the purse seine nets manually and don’t use machines at any point during fishing. So we use the fishnets with larger ‘kanni’ (holes) that ensure the escaping of smaller fishes from the net,” says a fisherman using purse seine net, who does not want to be quoted.

Assistant Director of Fisheries Mohanraj promised that he would personally conduct inspections soon to check the use of purse seine nets and take appropriate action against the erring fishermen if they were found to be using the banned fishnets.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/x9w5sx/article32901754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA21NETSTUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/use-of-banned-purse-seine-nets-has-kanniyakumari-fishermen-up-in-arms/article32901755.ece

300,2020/10/20,Masked men rob couple in Melur,"Two men have been arrested by the police

Six masked men robbed a couple of their mobile phones after assaulting the man outside his home in Therkamoor near Melur on Sunday night.

The police said that Balamurugan, who had recently returned from abroad, had come out of his home to buy dinner for his family. His wife had called him over the phone to inform him that some masked men were lurking outside the house.

Balamurugan, who rushed home, was attacked by the men, who snatched his expensive mobile phone. He sustained injuries on his head and shoulder. The dacoits robbed his wife’s mobile phone also.

The couple raised an alarm that alerted the neighbours at around 9.30 pm. Even before they could gather at his house, the robbers fled the scene under the cover of darkness.

However, local residents caught two persons, identified as R. Arunkumar (40) of Tiruchi and S. Iniyavan alias Deepan (38) of the Sri Lankan Refugee Camp at Tiruvathavur.

The police said that while Arunkumar had seven cases against him in Namakkal, Salem and Tiruchi districts, the other accused had cases in Ramanathapuram, Coimbatore and Dindigul districts.

The Melur police suspect that they could have been part of the dacoity gang. Both were arrested.

Auto driver robbed

In an unrelated case, two persons, who engaged an autorickshaw, assaulted the driver and robbed him of his vehicle, money and mobile phone after taking him to a secluded place near Appanthirupathi on Sunday night.

The police said that S. Sekar of S. Kodikulam, had picked up the unidentified persons at the Arapalayam bus stand.

The duo had said that they wanted to go to Appanthirupathi. When the autorickshaw reached Appanthirupathi, they asked the driver to drop them at Velliyankundram Pudur at around 9.45 p.m. When the driver took them up to Velliyankundram Pudur bridge and said that he could not go further as the earthen road was slushy, the duo attacked him and robbed his valuables.

They pushed Sekar down and escaped from the scene in his autorickshaw.

Later, the vehicle was found near Mangulam, abandoned after it ran out of fuel.

301,2020/10/20,"Corpn. to rope in multi-purpose workers, valvemen to create awareness on waste segregation","Mangaluru City Corporation will use the services of its mutli-purpose workers and valvemen to create awareness on segregating waste at source, Mayor Diwakar said here on Tuesday.

Speaking at a consultative meeting with councillors on waste segregation, he sought the cooperation of councillors to create awareness among people on segregating waste.

Commissioner of the corporation Akshy Sridhar said that the civic body will also use the services of junior engineers to supervise waste segregating operations in the city. The corporation will popularise composting of wet waste in houses to reduce the quantity of garbage being generated in the city, he said.

Some councillors told the meeting that Antony Waste Handling Cell Pvt. Ltd. which collects and transports solid waste for the corporation is not collecting waste daily from some wards, especially those on the outskirts of the central business district area. Garbage is being collected in such wards once in three days. As per the contract with the civic body, the company should collect waste daily.

Replying to this, Environment Engineer of the corporation Madhu S. Manohar said that the company has told the civic body that it is facing the issue of maintenance of some of its vehicles due to delay in getting spare parts. The company was operating 84 vehicles for waste collection and transportation. Now, about eight of its vehicles are not operating due to maintenance issues. Hence, it is collecting waste in some wards once in three days.

In response, the Mayor said that in such a case the company should make alternative arrangements by hiring vehicles on its own to collect and transport waste. If not, it should outsource collection in such wards. Lack of availability of spare parts cannot be an excuse for stopping daily collection of waste.

Naveen R. D’Souza, a councillor, said that the civic body should collect all segregated waste daily. It should collect dry waste daily instead of once in a week that is on Fridays. If dry waste is collected only on Fridays, garbage will only pile up in apartments, he said.

Mr. D’Souza said that sanitary inspectors are not serious enough in monitoring waste segregation.

Another councillor Praveenchandra Alva said that the QR code system of monitoring waste segregation which has been implemented in a ward in the city on an experimental basis should be extended to all wards. It is to monitor whether solid waste has been collected from all houses and establishments or not.

Another councillor suggested that the corporation should make a short video on segregating waste at source and its importance and circulate it on social media to create awareness among people.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/corpn-to-rope-in-multi-purpose-workers-valvemen-to-create-awareness-on-waste-segregation/article32903667.ece

303,2020/10/20,Mangalore University drops digital evaluation plan of nearly 2.50 lakh answer scripts,"Mangalore University which had earlier planned for taking up digital evaluation of nearly 2.50 lakh answer scripts of its final semester examinations of 2019-20 has shelved the move. Now, it is going ahead with the process as per the conventional method, according to Registrar (Evaluation) of the university P.L. Dharma.

If the evaluation of the answer scripts of post-graduate examinations, which got over on October 6, has begun, the answer scripts of undergraduate examinations, completed on October 19, will be evaluated from October 27. More than 50,000 students had appeared for the examinations, he told The Hindu.

Mr. Dharma said that the digital evaluation plan has been shelved mainly due to two reasons. The teachers indicated that as all eligible evaluators are not familiar with the new move, there could be delay in completing evaluation thus, leading to delay in the announcement of results.

Secondly, last month’s floods in Udupi and heavy rain in Kodagu have created issues in uninterrupted internet connectivity and power supply to digital evaluation centres identified in Udupi and Kodagu districts.

In addition, the government’s approval for the new move was awaited. Hence, the plan was dropped.

He said that the evaluation of the papers of undergraduate examinations will go on briskly at three centres in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kodagu for five days from October 27 to October 31. In the earlier years, the evaluation of undergraduate examination papers scheduled only at a centralised centre in Mangaluru took about 13 days to complete. As there will be two more evaluation centres this year, one in Udupi and the other in Kodagu, the evaluation will be completed early. About 48,000 students have appeared for the undergraduate examinations, he said.

“We will ensure that the answer scripts reached all the three centres much in advance to enable teachers to begin the evaluation without any delay,” he said and added that the results will be announced at the earliest to enable students to join the post-graduate courses for 2020-21 by November 15.

He said that 50 % of the answer scripts of post-graduate examinations have been evaluated now.

He said that the answer scripts of 60 students who wrote the undergraduate and post-graduate papers in the examination centres of the university in Bhutan, Manipur, Jammu and Kashmi, Lakshadweep Islands and in Dharwad have reached the university. The examinations had been conducted there as a one-time measure due to the COVID-19 situation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/mangalore-university-drops-digital-evaluation-plan-of-nearly-250-lakh-answer-scripts/article32902631.ece

307,2020/10/20,Lack of specialised services in govt. hospitals is keeping people away: Muneer Katipalla,"Mr. Katipalla said that every citizen has the right to get quality health services at affordable cost

While private hospitals have commercialised their operations, the neglect of government hospitals by the State government and the absence of specialised treatment services have made people turn away from government hospitals in Dakshina Kannada, said Democratic Youth Federation of India State President Muneer Katipalla on Monday.

Speaking at a protest in front of the office of Bantwal MLA Rajesh Naik U. in Bantwal, Mr. Katipalla said that every citizen has the right to get quality health services at affordable cost. It was not happening in Dakshina Kannada where private hospitals continue to dominate and the cost of treatment has become unbearable for the common man.

People have realised the hard way during COVID-19 when private hospitals have charged rates in excess while disregarding the norms laid down by the government, he said.

The State government has failed to improve facilities in the primary health centres, taluk hospitals and district hospitals. Many posts, including that of medical officers, specialist doctors and nursing staff, are vacant. The State government should strengthen the government hospitals and also upgrade Government Wenlock and Lady Goschen Hospitals in Mangaluru into speciality hospitals , he said.

Giving impetus to training youth in surf life saving skill, the Dakshina Kannada district administration will set up a Surf Life Saving School at the second entrance to Tannirbhavi beach here.

Surf life saving is about teaching sea swimming skills and using them for rescuing people.

Setting up a Surf Life Saving School was among the steps proposed by the State Tourism Department to improving facilities at Tannirbhavi, Sasihitlu and other beaches in the State in 2017. The then Tourism Minister Priyank M. Kharge had sanctioned ₹ 5 crore for the school.

“The Surf Life Saving School will come up shortly,” Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra told The Hindu.

Recently, Mangaluru City North MLA Y. Bharath Shetty chaired a meeting in which the school project was discussed. “Instead of a concrete structure, we have proposed to use metallic and other material for building a green building in the green canopy of the beach. The design is being finalised. The work is likely to start in a week’s time,” he said.

Mr. Rajendra added that he is working with Mangaluru City Corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar and other stakeholders in further improving tourism facilities in the city. “There is now a healthy competition in the region to secure Blue Flag certification (for beaches),” he said.

Swimming coach Partha Varanashi, Director of Surflife Saving (India), which is affiliated to Rashtriya Life Saving Society (India), who proposed the surf life saving school, said that having the school will help in conducting life saving skill training on a regular basis.

“Cyclones are increasing year after year. We need one member from each family in the city to be trained in this skill that familiarises people with water,” he said.

Since the start of its operation in 2013, Surflife Saving (India) has trained 38 people in surf life saving at Tannirbhavi of which six have taken part in international surf life saving competitions. It trained 200 children in Udupi and 300 youths in Karwar in 2016.

312,2020/10/20,16% surge in FDI inflows till August,"Boosted by high stakes investments in Jio

Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India in the first five months of 2020-21 have hit a record high, despite a sharp 60% contraction in the first quarter, with July and August raking in over $20 billion of equity FDI.

Total FDI inflows surged from $11.51 billion between April and June to $35.73 billion by the end of August. Equity FDI more than quadrupled from $6.5 billion between April and June, to $27.1 billion by August — 16% higher than the first five months of 2019-20. To put that in context, India received about $50 billion in equity FDI in 2019-20.

Also read: India will continue to attract FDI, says U.N. trade body

Both, total FDI and equity FDI viewed in isolation, were the highest ever for the five month period, the Commerce and Industry Ministry said on Tuesday. The increased FDI is a result of FDI policy reforms, investment facilitation and ease of doing business, the Ministry said. Total FDI flows include fresh equity investments as well as re-invested earnings of foreign investors and other forms of investment capital such as debt.

FDI equity flows were boosted by investments into Jio Platforms, Reliance Industries’ telecom subsidiary, from global investors like Google, that bet $4.5 billion on the venture in July.

Also read: Government nod mandatory for FDI from neighbouring countries

But this was not the only factor for the turnaround in FDI trends over two months, reckoned experts.

“There has been a lot of quiet private equity investments taking place in the real estate sector, which are expected to continue. Moreover, several existing foreign investors have realised the need to ramp up local supply chains after the pandemic hit,” said Vikram Doshi, partner (tax and regulatory issues) at PwC.

Also read: Govt’s decision on FDI in defence to enhance self-reliance in sector: Goyal

Mr. Doshi said the numbers would have been even higher if border tensions with China hadn’t triggered curbs on their investments into India. China has significant investments in Indian startups as well as the manufacturing sector, any enhancement of which would now need prior government approvals.

Yet, the next few months could see a further spurt in FDI. Firstly, there’s Reliance Retail’s buyout of Future group at the end of August, which was followed by multiple global capital infusions into the business — similar to investments into Jio. Those foreign investors' outlays will reflect in September’s data and beyond.

Secondly, investments committed under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for electronics manufacturing, from players such as Apple Inc’s suppliers, will begin to flow once approvals come in. Similar investments may be expected in pharma and chemicals under another PLI scheme.

313,2020/10/20,Centre said to ask at least eight PSUs to consider buy-backs,"‘Move to help cash-strapped govt. raise funds; firms include Coal India, NTPC’

India has asked at least eight state-run companies to consider share buy-backs in the fiscal year to March 2021, two government officials said, as New Delhi searches for ways to raise funds to rein in its fiscal deficit.

The firms asked include miner Coal India, power utility NTPC, minerals producer NMDC and Engineers India Ltd., said one of the sources, who sought anonymity as the discussions are private.

“Buy-back is an important tool in our strategy and it helps in building market price,” added the second official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.

India is unlikely to be anywhere near its fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of GDP for 2020/21 as COVID-19 curbs hit tax collections and delayed efforts to privatise Bharat Petroleum Corp. and flag carrier Air India.

In February, the government had set itself a target of raising more than $27 billion from privatisations and sale of minority stakes in state-owned companies this fiscal.

However, some PSUs, particularly in the oil sector, may not be able to do buy- backs, the sources warned, as the government’s stake is just sufficient to ensure its position as a majority holder. “The government stake in these companies is about 51% and there is a competing claim on their cash in the form of huge capex commitment and dividend payments,” the official said.

But for those with sufficient funds and capital expenditure below target for this fiscal year, the government could seek approval from the Cabinet to prune its stake to less than 51% in individual firms without giving up control, the official said.

India had tasked 23 state-run companies with capital expenditure of ₹1.65 trillion ($22.5 billion) this fiscal year, but some firms face spending challenges as the world’s second most populous nation adds virus infections.

The Centre had asked PSUs to either meet their targets for capital expenditure or “reward the shareholder in the form of a dividend,” the officials added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/w0vcg2/article32895232.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THBUNTPC,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/centre-said-to-ask-at-least-eight-psus-to-consider-buy-backs/article32895233.ece
314,2020/10/20,CPSEs told to meet 75% capex target by December,"FM urges spending to spur economy

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday exhorted large central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) to achieve 75% of their planned capital expenditure (capex) target for FY21 by December, to support economic growth impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.

She held a virtual meeting with Secretaries of coal and petroleum & natural gas, along with the Chairmen and Managing Directors (CMDs) of 14 CPSEs belonging to these Ministries, an official statement said.

This was the fourth in the ongoing series of meetings that the Finance Minister has been having with various stakeholders with an aim to accelerate economic growth amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

While reviewing the performance of CPSEs, Ms. Sitharaman said capex by CPSEs was a critical driver of economic growth and needed to be scaled up for FY21 and FY22.

In FY20, against the capex target of ₹1,11,672 crore for these 14 CPSEs, the achievement was ₹1,16,323 crore, that is, 104%, the statement said, adding that the capex target was pegged at ₹1,15,934 crore for these firms for the current fiscal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/cpses-told-to-meet-75-capex-target-by-december/article32895307.ece

316,2020/10/20,HUL net rises 9% on rural sales,"FMCG firm cautiously optimistic about demand; declares ₹14 interim dividend

Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) major Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL) reported a 9% increase in second-quarter net profit to ₹2,009 crore, aided by a robust performance in rural markets while demand in urban areas, especially in metropolitan cities, remained muted.

Sales climbed 16% to ₹11,276 crore. However, excluding the impact of the merger of GSK Consumer Healthcare and the acquisition of ‘VWash’ (a hygiene product), turnover rose by 3%.

Double-digit growth

“Health, hygiene and nutrition, forming about 80% of our portfolio, grew in double digits [during the quarter],” the company said in a regulatory filing.

“In the context of a challenging economic environment, our growth has been competitive and profitable,” said CMD Sanjiv Mehta.

“Our operations and service levels are now back to pre-COVID-19 levels and we have accelerated the pace of digitising our operations,” Mr. Mehta added.

“The economic outlook has improved given the various initiatives taken by the government and Reserve Bank of India. In our sector, rural markets have been resilient and providing robust performance but the demand in urban India especially in metropolitan cities has been muted and uncertain. We believe that the worst is behind us and we are cautiously optimistic on demand recovery,” he said.

The soaps to packaged foods maker declared an interim dividend of ₹14.

During the quarter ended September 30, the company’s household care business did well across all segments led by continued penetration gains. But consumption of laundry products were affected due to confined living in metros.

HUL said while the health, hygiene and nutrition businesses performed well, discretion and out-of-home products lagged as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bxytem/article32903607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21BUHUL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/hul-net-rises-9-on-rural-sales/article32903609.ece
317,2020/10/20,"‘Videocon can earn ₹6,000-cr. revenue’","Dhoot urges nod for promoters’ plan

Videocon Industries can garner at least ₹6,000 crore in revenue in the first year after recommencing operations if the promoters’ proposal to repay about ₹30,000 crore to regain control of the firm is accepted by the lenders, said Pradeep Dhoot, former director of the debt-laden firm..

“Before going to the NCLT in October 2017, we and the banks had agreed on the repayment of ₹30,000 crore,” Mr. Dhoot said in an interview.

“However, the RBI directed that the company be sent to debt resolution. We have given the same proposal with an extended timeline of three years as two years have already been wasted in the IBC,” he added.

He stressed the proposal submitted under clause 12A of the IBC would lead to the promoters just managing the company again and not owning the firm. “All the shares, equity and the assets will remain with the bank till all the loans are repaid.

“A decision by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) is likely within two months,” Mr. Dhoot said. “We have given a proper business plan of up to 10-12 years. Of the ₹30,000 crore plus interest up to December 31, 2020, that we have proposed to repay, a major portion will come from asset monetisation and business generated by the company,” he added.

Monetising ‘huge’ assets

Mr. Dhoot said the company and Videocon Group had ‘huge assets’ which would be monetised in due course. He also expressed confidence in the proposal getting accepted.

If the proposal is accepted, “we will be able begin operations in a month and generate revenue of at least ₹6,000 crore in the first fiscal when the total market for the four products [ACs, washing machines, TVs and refrigerators] will be about ₹70,000 crore.The first quarter of the calendar year 2021 will be low, but then we will target about 9% of the market.”

He pointed out in 2017, when Videocon was still operational, the total share of Chinese players in these segments was about 12%. It had now grown to about 35%.

“The new players took our share, not the established players like Samsung and LG. Hence, I think it will be easier for us to take it back.”

Further, on account of the pandemic, the lenders were hardly receiving any offers. The highest offer right now was about ₹3,000-₹3,500 crore.

“Videocon has 15,000 retailers, 30,000 direct and indirect employees, many vendors. They will be saved,” he said.There are 20-crore customers. So, the belief in the company and the brand is very strong. The repayment structure we have stated mentioned will not be difficult.

“Once upon a time, they were having 20 bidders, but now, because of the pandemic, they hardly have four bidders. New investment is not coming,” he said. “The second thing is we know the company and we will be able to run this company very well. So, there is a great chance that they will accept this,” he added.

If the proposal was not approved, the firm would likely go to a new investor, he said adding the chance of liquidation was very low.“If our help is needed, we will support the investors because all vendors, employees and distributors, they all are dependent on this.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/8ptxjx/article32903552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21BUVIDEOCON,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/videocon-can-earn-6000-cr-revenue/article32903555.ece

319,2020/10/20,Intel to sell NAND business to South Korean rival for $9 billion,"SK Hynix will acquire Intel’s NAND memory chip and storage business, including a related manufacturing site in the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian.

Intel has agreed to a $9 billion deal to sell most of its memory business to South Korea’s SK Hynix as it moves toward more diverse technologies while shedding a major Chinese factory at a time of deepening trade friction between Washington and Beijing.

Intel said it will keep its Optane business of more advanced memory products, which analysts say are mostly produced in the United States.

According to the plan confirmed by the companies on Tuesday, SK Hynix will acquire Intel’s NAND memory chip and storage business, including a related manufacturing site in the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian. SK Hynix said the companies expect to get required governmental approvals for the deal by late 2021.

The transaction, if completed, could reportedly make SK Hynix the world’s second-largest provider of NAND flash memory chips behind Samsung Electronics, another South Korean chip giant.

Demand for flash memory has strengthened in recent months due to buying of personal computers and servers as the coronavirus pandemic forces millions to work from home.

Intel said it plans to invest proceeds from the transaction into advancing long-growth priorities, including technologies related to artificial intelligence and fifth-generation wireless networks.

This transaction will allow us to further prioritise our investments in differentiated technology where we can play a bigger role in the success of our customers and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders, Bob Swan, Intel’s CEO, said in a statement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/apunw5/article32901004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THAPINTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/intel-to-sell-nand-business-to-south-korean-rival-for-9-billion/article32901005.ece

321,2020/10/20,Govt. working on giving flexibility to Air India bidders to decide on debt: DIPAM Secy,"As per the Air India EoI floated by DIPAM in January, of the airline’s total debt of ₹60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb ₹23,286.5 crore

In a bid to resurrect Air India privatisation, the government is planning to give flexibility to potential investors to decide on the humongous debt with the national carrier, a top official has said.

Also read: Air India bid deadline may be extended till December 15, govt to ease asset valuation norm

The flexibility to potential investors on the quantum of the ₹60,074 crore debt that they want to absorb will replace the current condition of the buyer taking over more than a third of the debt and transferring the rest to a special purpose vehicle, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said.

The potential investors in Air India have given feedback that due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19 in the aviation sector the debt should not be fixed at the Expression of Interest (EoI) stage, he added.

As per the Air India EoI floated by DIPAM in January, of the airline’s total debt of ₹60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb ₹23,286.5 crore, while the rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle.

The government is seeking to sell 100% of its stake in the State-owned national airline, including Air India’s 100% shareholding in AI Express Ltd. and 50% in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.

“On Air India, we would try and sort out the investor issues with respect to debt...we will see whether we can give flexibility at least at the EoI stage and let the debt be determined through the market rather than freezing it upfront. This is what we are examining,” Mr. Pandey told PTI in an interview.

He said a decision on this would be soon taken by Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) and if there is a change in the Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM), the potential investors would be given time to raise queries.

“There is a lot of uncertainty in the aviation sector due to COVID and accordingly we should structure the transaction. We should not fix everything at the EoI stage. That’s the feedback we are getting. The point is what debt is sustainable. There is a point of view that it can be decided by the market rather than we upfront deciding,” he noted.

The AISAM would take a final call on whether bidding for Air India will take place based on equity value or enterprise value, he added.

“We are examining the issue and a decision will soon be taken by AISAM,” Mr. Pandey added.

The last date for submission of bids for Air India is October 30, which according to sources is likely to be extended till mid-December following the change in PIM.

A popular valuation methodology for takeover deals - Enterprise value (EV) is a measure of a company’s total value, often used as a more comprehensive alternative to equity market capitalisation. EV includes in its calculation the market capitalisation of a company, but also short-term and long-term debt as well as any cash on the company’s balance sheet.

On the sale of a strategic stake of the government in other CPSEs, Mr. Pandey said there are some transactions that have reached the second stage like the two steel plants of SAIL, and Central Electronics Ltd.

“New EoIs will come in Shipping Corporation of India, In Concor (Container Corporation) as soon as Railways finalise the land policy then we can come out with EoI. We can come out with EoI on BEML because their land issues mostly we have sorted out. EoI on Nilachal Ispat Nigam Ltd, Pawan Hans is shortly expected,” he said, adding the bid documents for all of these companies will be issued in November.

Mr. Pandey further said that the initial public offering (IPOs) of 4 CPSEs — IRFC, RailTel, TCIL and WAPCOS — are in the pipeline for the current fiscal.

For the current fiscal, the budget has pegged disinvestment proceeds at ₹2.10 lakh crore. This includes ₹1.20 lakh crore from CPSE share sale and ₹90,000 crore from a share sale in public sector banks and financial institutions, including the listing of insurance behemoth LIC.

So far this fiscal, ₹5,695 crore has been mopped up through the CPSE stake sale.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r2chlq/article32442342.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/govt-working-on-giving-flexibility-to-air-india-bidders-to-decide-on-debt-dipam-secy/article32900662.ece

CLUE: You and I rose, for one backing Professor Lupin, say (8)

Clue types : Example, reversal

Definition : Professor Lupin, say

Answer : WEREWOLF

Clue explained:

If you want to discover the 8-letter word here, you have to know a little bit about J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter.... Not saying that it’s a classic or anything, because many would object to a children’s fantasy series even being compared to, say, an Anna Karenina or an Atlas Shrugged. But to solve this clue, knowing a little about the characters of the HP world would be a tad bit useful.

So, the clue says ‘you and I’, which immediately brings to mind its synonym — WE.

Now, look at the words ‘rose, for one’. The phrase ‘for one’ is used to point to an example. Like, if someone said, “Person who exists, for one”, they could very likely mean you. As in, you! You are a person who exists! Another word used to indicate to an example is ‘say’. Anyway, moving on with the rest of the clue...

So, ‘rose, for one’ implies that we need to think of what a ‘rose’ is an example of. Well, a rose is a flower, isn’t it?

Well, now look at the next word after ‘rose, for one...’. It is ‘backing’. Now, “backing” is a cryptic setter’s way of suggesting that something goes back, as in a reversal. So, if the letters of the word ‘flower’ are put in reverse order, you get REWOLF.

Now, put WE and REWOLF together, and it becomes WEREWOLF, which is what Professor Lupin was an example of in the Harry Potter books!",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/ok399h/article31050432.ece/alternates/FREE_660/15SMIndianWolfWikiCommonsjpg,https://crossword.thehindu.com/clued-in/clued-in-159-where-is-the-wolf-look-inside-the-sheeps-clothing/article32896005.ece
323,2020/10/20,Many gains in fighting HIV,"There is a reduction in new HIV infections among children and in AIDS-related deaths in India

In this challenging moment when we are confronted with one of the biggest health emergencies in our history, the COVID-19 pandemic, we find our strength in the gains we are making despite this disruption.

Steps forward

The newly released 2019 HIV estimates by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO)/Ministry of Health and Family Welfare with the technical support of UNAIDS tell us that there has been a 66.1% reduction in new HIV infections among children and a 65.3% reduction in AIDS-related deaths in India over a nine-year period. The number of pregnant women living with HIV has reduced from 31,000 in 2010 to 20,000 in 2019. Overall, antenatal coverage has expanded, and HIV testing has increased over time and within target range. Treatment coverage has also expanded.

Under the leadership of NACO, a ‘Fast-Tracking of EMTCT (elimination of mother-to-child transmission) strategy-cum-action plan’ was outlined by June 2019, in the run-up towards December 2020: the deadline to achieve EMTCT. The plan entailed mobilisation and reinforcement of all national, State and partners’ collective efforts — in a strategic manner, with district-level focus, and considering latest evidence — so that the States/Union Territories and the country as a whole achieve the EMTCT goal. Additionally, in March 2020, we began efforts to minimise challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

From 2010 to 2019, India made important progress in reducing the HIV impact on children through prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This was done through education and communication programmes; increased access to HIV services with innovative delivery mechanisms for HIV testing (community-based testing, partner testing or index testing); counselling and care; and treatment and follow-ups. India made HIV testing for all pregnant women free and HIV treatment is offered the same way nationwide without cost to pregnant mothers living with HIV through the national ‘treat all’ policy.

Cognisant of the challenge of diagnosing 20,000 pregnant women living with HIV in an estimated 30 million pregnancies annually in India, for two years UNICEF has worked with the World Health Organization and NACO to identify high burden districts (in terms of density of pregnant women living with HIV) as the last mile towards disease elimination.

Since 2002, when the EMTCT of HIV programmes or prevention of parent-to-child transmission of HIV were launched in India, a series of policy, programmatic and implementation strategies were rolled out so that all pregnant women can access free HIV testing along with other services at antenatal clinics, and free treatment regimens for life to prevent HIV transmission from mothers to babies. This has been made possible in government health centres and grass-root level workers through village health and nutrition days and other grass-roots events under the National Health Mission.

Indeed, the approach being promoted by UNICEF in focusing attention and resources in high burden districts is supported by the HIV strategic information division of NACO and UNAIDS to better understand the locations and populations most HIV affected, so that technical support and HIV services can be directed towards these areas.

Still a long way to go

However, there remains a need for increased treatment saturation coverage and for early HIV testing and treatment initiation to become the normal. While periodic monitoring of the data and reviews are the mainstay of the programme response, by 2019 it was very evident to all the stakeholders that while there are successes, we have a long way to go towards the final targets.

Using data-driven and decision-making approaches, we are certain that AIDS will no longer be a public health threat for children in India by the end 2030, if not before.

324,2020/10/20,Dormant but waiting to strike,"Terror outfits like al-Qaeda continue to pose threats to India and its neighbourhood

During the pandemic, we have fortunately been hearing little about terror organisations of the likes of the Taliban, al-Qaeda, Islamic State, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). This is partly explained by the fact that open terror attacks have been reducing, presumably because terror outfits lack resources and because of temporary loss of support from those normally hostile to the non-Islamic world and tolerant Muslims.

Still a threat

But there is no ground to conclude that terror outfits have become less vicious or are irrelevant. Given their past resilience, they continue to pose threats to modern society, especially to India and its neighbourhood. They are also not less alluring to misguided youth in India whose loyalties are extraterritorial. Their numbers may not be formidable, but they can cause a ripple effect that cannot be underestimated. Terrorist cells are probably engaged in the quiet process of garnering resources for future lethal assaults against India and other countries in the neighbourhood, which are considered anti-Islamic by them. Once the pandemic eases, we may see a resurgence of terror. The aggravation of poverty in developing nations due to COVID-19 could offer a fertile ground for recruitment and intensified religious indoctrination, which are dangerous to peace.

Also read: Members of banned terror outfit arrested in Delhi

We should keep a particularly close eye on the al-Qaeda and the Islamic State because there is evidence that their recruitment remains undiminished by the problems posed by the pandemic. Reports say that these outfits have been reorganising and rebuilding during the pandemic. Only these two outfits have an impressive global reach backed by global ambitions. They are present not only in West Asia but also in Africa. The other outfits — JeM, LeT, etc. — are confined to the Afghanistan-Pakistan area.

Of great import in this context is the Doha Accord signed on February 29 this year between the Taliban and the U.S., which has brought about an improved relationship between the two. The U.S. is now less of an adversary to the Taliban because it has agreed to a near total withdrawal of its troops in return for the Taliban’s promise to preserve peace in Afghanistan. Ironically, the U.S. intervened in Afghanistan immediately after 9/11 only to capture Osama bin Laden and his associates. However, it ended up getting entangled with the Taliban. After hostilities for several years, the U.S. and the Taliban have displayed some sagacity and are in the process of brokering peace.

Implications of Doha Accord for India

Considered a great victory for the Taliban, and possibly to a smaller extent for Pakistan, the Doha Accord has some serious implications for India. The Taliban’s assurance to the U.S. that, as part of the agreement, it will keep the al-Qaeda under check seems an exercise in deception. The U.S. is not so naïve as to take the Taliban’s promise seriously. The Taliban and the al-Qaeda need each other in many areas. Both are friendly towards Pakistan and could pose a problem or two to India in the near future. This is worrying.

Also read: Pakistan as both terror perpetrator and victim

This scenario highlights the fact that India will have no respite from the al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, the two most organised and motivated groups. Many recent raids by the National Investigation Agency point to an al-Qaeda network in India. In one such raid, nine activists belonging to Kerala and West Bengal were arrested for conspiring to attack various targets, including the National Capital Region. Also relevant is the training support received from Pakistan. Once the situation gets better, the al-Qaeda, in cahoots with other aggressive Islamic outfits in and around Pakistan, is bound to escalate the offensive against India. Pakistan will be unabashedly privy to such manoeuvres though it will continue to pretend otherwise. This is one factor that makes the al-Qaeda and other terror outfits still relevant to India’s security calculus. These outfits may not indulge in spectacular attacks like 9/11, but they will have the determination and prowess to carry out operations that will unnerve our population on the border.

How can India protect itself against terrorism in the neighbourhood? There are some observers who are inclined to downplay the al-Qaeda because it has not repeated anything on the scale of 9/11. They also cite as a reason the ease with which the U.S. tracked down bin Laden in Pakistan and killed him. They also say the outfit’s leadership is ageing. In the past few years, it is true that the al-Qaeda has lost many of its leaders in encounters with U.S. agencies. Vulnerability is writ large on the al-Qaeda’s face. But operational skill and swiftness can quickly turn peace into disorder. The al-Qaeda has a robust cadre from which a strong and young leader could still emerge to lead it in order to intimidate the civilised world.

325,2020/10/20,Nitish’s claims and Bihar’s reality,"The Chief Minister says he has delivered good governance and prosperity, but data show otherwise

As Bihar goes to the polls, it is important to scrutinise Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s repeated claims about delivering ‘sushasan’ (good governance) and ‘taraqqi’ (prosperity). Does the reality justify these claims? Or are these boasts similar to the ‘Gujarat Model’, merely effective as propaganda?

Poor on many indicators

Bihar’s economy has performed poorly under the Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party coalition government. Its gross state domestic product (GSDP) is well below the average of other States. Between 2011-12 and 2018-19, its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 6.16%, while the average of all States and Union Territories was 7.73%. Given its low economic base, Bihar should have clocked immense growth if it was governed half as well as the propaganda would have you believe. A couple of good years of economic growth have been overhyped to hide the overall poor performance.

The CAGR of Bihar’s per capita income (PCI) was 4% in the 2011-12 and 2018-19 period, while the average of all States and Union Territories was 5.61%. In fact, Bihar’s PCI is the lowest in the country. While in 2011-12, Bihar’s PCI was 26.11% of the overall average, it fell to 23.48% in 2018-19. In 2004-05, before Mr. Kumar took over, Bihar’s PCI was 26.48% of the overall average. An analysis of the suppressed National Sample Survey’s consumption expenditure survey revealed that between 2011-12 and 2017-18, poverty in Bihar increased by 17 percentage points to 50.47%. Does making Biharis poorer count as taraqqi?

Bihar’s debt burden has grown considerably: 375% since 2005 levels. Outstanding liabilities as a percentage of GSDP have been increasing since 2014-15. The Comptroller and Auditor General’s audit of Bihar’s finances noted, “Since 80 to 85 per cent of the borrowed funds were utilised for repayment of borrowings and interest thereon which implies that the State was spending less on developmental activities.”

Jobs continue to be scarce. The National Sample Survey’s periodic labour force survey (2017-18) revealed that 87% of workers in Bihar do not have a regular/salaried job. In this respect, Bihar is the worst performing State in the country. The unemployment rate has remained in double digits since February 2019, peaking at 46.6% in May this year. Suicides due to unemployment have increased by 438% since 2015.

Bihar was a pioneer in abolishing Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC). Agriculture remains one of the largest employment-generating sectors but Bihar has the lowest average monthly income per agricultural household (₹3,558) in the country.The national average is ₹6,426. More than 86% of Bihar’s marginal agricultural households are in debt compared to the national average of 63.6%. The agricultural growth rate fell to 0.6% in 2018-19 and crops recorded a negative growth rate of 3.9%.

A study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research post the APMC reforms concluded that net income had been declining. Mr. Kumar’s government has simply abandoned Bihar’s farmers, who receive a price much lower than the MSP due to inefficiencies by procurement agencies. More than 80% of procurement centres have shut down since 2015. This Rabi season, less than 1% of Bihar’s wheat was procured. This is neither sushasan nor taraqqi.

The crown jewel of the good governance propaganda has been the claim of improved law and order. The reality is vastly different. Between 2010 and 2019, crimes in Bihar nearly doubled. Bihar ranks second in the country in violent crimes. Crimes against women and children increased at 26% and 73%, respectively, between 2017 and 2019. Every day, more than 12 minors are kidnapped for forced child marriages, the highest incidence of such crimes in the country.

A government that doesn’t act

Given these crime statistics, one would expect any responsible government to act. Unfortunately, not the Nitish Kumar government. Until June 2019, Bihar had not spent a single rupee out of the different programmes under the Nirbhaya Fund. Only after much criticism were some of the sanctioned funds actually utilised, but 59% of the funds still remain unspent. Further, the alleged ‘kidnapping raj’ seems to be thriving under the National Democratic Alliance: kidnappings have increased by 391% between 2005 and 2019.

Last, migrant labourers who returned home to Bihar after the sudden announcement of a lockdown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been disillusioned by the Bihar government’s empty assurances of employment and livelihood opportunities. The government’s tall claims of issuing more job cards are moot when existing card-holders cannot find work. Bihar has more than 2.5 crore workers registered under MGNREGA (the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act). However, only 4,788 households have completed 100 days of MGNREGA work guaranteed under the Act. The Central government’s apathy combined with the Bihar government’s neglect are proving disastrous for the people.

Bihar’s citizens regularly face the brunt of floods and havoc inflicted by nature. More than natural calamities and pandemics, it is Bihar’s elected leadership’s inability to deliver sushasan that ensures that taraqqiremains a distant dream.

326,2020/10/20,The sorry plight of the Andhra Pradesh higher judiciary,"The letter of the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister cannot be brushed aside as interference with judicial independence

The High Court of Andhra Pradesh has seen many a legal gem and it is unfortunate that today, one of the three organs of the state, the executive, appears to have lost faith in the judiciary and the very same High Court. Who can forget Justice Koka Subba Rao who was the first Chief Justice and later went on to become the ninth Chief Justice of India in 1966? Or that Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy was the beacon for other High Courts?

Also read: ‘It’s up to the CJI to take a decision on CM’s letter’

The two sides

Against such a backdrop, the letter by the Chief Minister of the State of Andhra Pradesh to the Chief Justice of India, with allegations against a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court of India is cause for concern.

While some could argue that the executive could have a grudge against the judiciary and that the grievance aired by the Chief Minister of the State could be a reflection of this, at the same time, one cannot gloss over whatever the High Court has done. The Chief Minister’s allegation is that the High Court is being controlled by loyalists of his predecessor in office and political rival, passing orders against his regime and its actions. From the High Court’s point of view, the State police is reluctant to take action against those carrying on an online campaign against the court.

The orders passed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh are disturbing. For example, the order gagging the press and directing the media (print, electronic, and social media) to take down whatever has already been published is quite strange since this protects not only the petitioner, the former Advocate General, but also the others named or not named in the First Information Report (FIR). Those named in the FIR, other than the former Advocate General, are not even aggrieved as they did not approach the court for similar relief. But the gag-and-take-down order protects them too, without their being parties to the proceedings.

This makes the writ petition a proxy litigation, filed not only on behalf of the petitioner, but also on behalf of all others. Considering the high profile of two persons named in the FIR who were not before the court, the stay of investigation, the stay of arrest of all those named and not named in the FIR, and the direction issued to the media not to publish and to take down whatever has already been published is shocking and the government is justified in making a grievance out of it.

One that is self-inflicted

But the damage caused by the High Court to its own reputation by something done on the administrative side is even more shocking. In a writ petition filed by the BC, SC, ST and Minority Student Federation seeking certain reliefs in the wake of the unfortunate death of the then Registrar General of the High Court, the court filed a counter affidavit.

Also read | Judges are becoming victims of juicy gossip and slanderous social media posts, says Justice N.V. Ramana

Paragraph 13 of the counter affidavit contained allegations as though the writ petition was engineered, at the behest of the State Government, by a former Acting Chief Justice of the combined High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad, who now holds office as Chairman of the Fee Fixation Committee for professional colleges. Had it been filed by any other party, paragraph 13 would have provoked the High Court to come down heavily on such a party. It reads as follows: ‘13. As per the preliminary objections, it is clear that this petition is filed by a political person to political gain and to malign the High Court. In this sequel it is relevant that former Justice V. Eshwaraiah, who was appointed as chairman of the A.P. Higher Education Regulatory Committee and chairman of the BC Association, has also submitted a complaint with the same allegations to the President of India referred herein above against the Chief Justice. His appointment on the said post was made by the State Government as per the recommendation (September 4, 2019) issuing notification in the second week of September 2019. The said recommendation was after the recommendation to appoint a regular Chief Justice of High Court of Andhra Pradesh on August 22, 2019 by the collegium of the Supreme Court. Thus, his appointment is under persuasion of the State Government to favour him. On having achieved his desire of appointment after post retirement, he wants to support the State Government under the cover of BC Association maligning the High Court... In fact, the State government is not happily accepting the verdicts of the High Court given in various cases against them. ... however, unscrupulous comments degrading the image of the institution are floated in social media by various persons, including the sitting Member of Parliament, the Speaker of the Assembly on which suo motu contempt proceedings have been initiated. Therefore, in view of the preliminary objections and the above facts, filing of this petition is mala fide and to achieve the oblique intention.’

Editorial | Unpleasant spectacle

That the High Court, in a counter affidavit to a writ petition, can: attack the State Government as being hostile; attack a former Acting Chief Justice as the person behind a litigation, and attack the senior-most serving judge of the very same High Court for obliging the State Government and recommending the name of the former Acting Chief Justice for appointment as the Fee Fixation Committee, is unthinkable.

The statement now made by the Chief Minister that the High Court is being used and manipulated to trample on the democratically elected government has to be seen in the context of the High Court’s own stand in a counter affidavit filed in a writ petition that the State Government is hostile to the court.

Comment | A constitutional pickle of the Andhra kind

The issue did not end at that. In the writ petition, an application was filed by a subordinate judicial officer, who is now under suspension pending disciplinary proceedings, seeking intervention. In his intervention application, the judicial officer has claimed that the former Acting Chief Justice of the combined High court of Judicature at Hyderabad, whose name was dragged in by the High Court in its counter affidavit, made a call to him offering help in the departmental enquiries pending against him.

The intervention application was accompanied by the transcript of the telephonic conversation he purportedly had. According to this transcript, the former Acting Chief Justice confessed to him that he had engineered the writ petition filed by the BC, SC, ST and Minority Student Federation.

‘Hold an inquiry’

After the filing of this intervention application by the suspended judicial officer, the case took an interesting turn. The High Court filed an application for deletion of paragraph 13 of the original counter affidavit, in which the court had alleged that the writ petition was engineered by the former Acting Chief Justice at the behest of the State government.

Thereafter, a Division Bench specially constituted for the purpose took note of the contents of the intervention application and passed an order on August 13, 2020 holding that the conversation whose transcript was produced as a document along with a pen drive, prima facie disclosed a conspiracy against the Chief Justice of the High Court and the senior most Judge of the Supreme Court. After so holding, the Andhra Pradesh High Court passed an order to the following effect: ‘In view of the law discussed above in various judgments referred supra, this court while exercising power of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, more particularly, while deciding a public interest litigation, procedural technicalities will not come in the way. Hence, we find that it is a fit case to order enquiry to find out the authenticity/genuineness of the conversation contained in the pen drive. Therefore, we request Justice R.V. Raveendran, retired Judge of the Supreme Court of India, to hold an inquiry to find out the authenticity/genuineness of the conversation, contained in the pen drive, with regard to the plot designed against the Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh and being designed against senior most sitting judges of the Supreme Court and undisclosed interest of third parties. Registry is directed to obtain the consent of Justice R.V. Raveendran, retired judge of Supreme Court and provide necessary assistance. The inquiry is limited to find out the authenticity/genuineness of the conversation and third party interest behind the plot.’

327,2020/10/20,A tool for thought: On coronavirus pandemic in India,"Pandemic forecasts must be used to induce changes and avoid worst-case scenarios

A committee of experts — well-regarded mathematicians and infectious disease experts — appointed by the Department of Science and Technology to use mathematical modelling and forecast the course of the pandemic has brought good tidings. By their estimate, India passed its COVID-19 peak in September and the decline in the overall caseload being observed for nearly a month now is to continue. Active cases, about 7.5 lakh now, are expected to drop below 50,000 by December, and by February, the pandemic is likely to extinguish itself with only ‘minimal’ (not zero) infections. While it is reasonable to assume that the seven-member committee has been scrupulous, the caveat is that this is still a forecast based on mathematical modelling. There are some strong assumptions. The decline will continue only if there are no major mutations during winter, protective antibodies are durable, and current restrictions are maintained. There would be no significant gains from a strict lockdown beyond the district level, and current containment measures would suffice, except if there are local outbreaks that threaten to overwhelm health-care facilities there. Their calculation also showed a peak by July latest, with anything from six to 15 times the existing infections had there been no lockdown or if it had been delayed to April.

The purpose of pandemic modelling is to generate a probabilistic overview of the future and mathematical modelling has become a popular, creative exercise, with several models and forecasts being made available on pre-print servers and pending peer-review. The latest model is expected to be published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research this week, but it appears to be a quotidian exercise. The datasets it has relied on are publicly available and the modelling employs a category of models called SEIR that estimates, within a population, those Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered. It is extremely dependent on the quality of data that is used as an input and relies as much on simplifying assumptions that sacrifice complexity for comprehension but there is nothing to suggest, from what is known about the exercise, that it is more likely to be true than similar estimates from scores of models the world over that subscribe to a certain degree of rigour. Experts associated with the pandemic have reiterated many times that mathematical modelling ought not to be taken literally. The latest assessment too should then be used not to critique or justify past decisions but dwell more on the future. For instance, if the model suggests that the pandemic would extinguish by February with a dramatic dip by December, then should the accelerated clinical trials of potential vaccines be top priority? Mathematical models, to be useful, must induce policy or behavioural change to avoid their own worst-case scenarios and this latest assessment must be seen — no more, no less — as a tool to this end.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-tool-for-thought-on-coronavirus-pandemic-in-india/article32895575.ece
328,2020/10/20,The NEET challenge: On conducting of NEET exams,"As NEET progresses, States must take affirmative action to protect weaker sections

In a year when merely executing the norm becomes an achievement, the conduct of two rounds of NEET, attendance at the test and the publication of results, all in the face of resistance from certain States, can presumably count as achievements. The results were declared last week, and the top score was a perfect 720, scored not by one, but two students, who will have their choice of college in the undergraduate medical programme. The decision to conduct the exam, when there was uncertainty about the ability of students to reach the centres, was probably bold, though it had not factored in the lowest common denominator. But then, the NEET is not about catering to the lowest common denominator, it is avowedly about standardising medical education, ensuring the quality of medical graduates who will hopefully go on to serve society. Working with the ideal of raising the quality is clearly a laborious, time-consuming process, and is bound to be uneven at the start, even if all States have begun to level the playing field. Different States have been allowed to offer their own education systems — different streams with varying standards and pedagogies — and NEET brings in an overarching single syllabus not all have access to. Therein begin the inequities. Students in certain circumstances, (poor, living in remote areas and disadvantaged, for instance), and in certain boards of education (State board, for instance) will remain at a disadvantage, as a result of this.

Even as scores show an overall improvement over the years, States must not rest in their endeavour to ease the access to, and enhance students’ ability to clear the test successfully, even without the need to spend much on coaching classes. Certain measures, including Tamil Nadu’s move to reserve 7.5% of MBBS seats for State government school students who clear NEET, running State-sponsored, free or heavily subsidised coaching programmes, and a reassessment of the regional State syllabus, will all enable a more equitable scenario. If coaching can help bridge the yawning gap, then the State could mandate that private coaching centres do not charge exorbitantly for conducting year-long coaching programmes and even provide reasonable subsidies for certain groups of students. Meanwhile, the overemphasis by parents on medicine as the only career option for their wards, and wanton politicisation of NEET will merely serve to exacerbate the acute deficiencies of the process. Pandemic-related challenges notwithstanding, for true positive impact, any welfare state must build systems around the core ideas of equity of access and affordability — especially in education and health care.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-neet-challenge-on-conducting-of-neet-exams/article32895579.ece
329,2020/10/20,BBMP mulls granting civic chief power to enhance property tax,"Civic body draws up list of top 100 tax defaulters

To ensure that property tax rates are enhanced on time, the civic body is exploring the possibility of vesting the power to approve the increase in tax rates to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Commissioner. Sources in the civic body said that this proposal has come up for discussion in a few forums.

A senior official in the civic body’s Revenue Department said that as per the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, property tax rates have to be enhanced every three years.

“There are different interpretations… while some say the Commissioner can approve the hike in tax, there are others who say that the tax revision may be approved only by the elected body first and later by the State government. Since 2008, the civic body has been seeking approval of the BBMP council and then the State government,” the official said.

However, the BBMP council and State government have not been approving the proposal to revise tax rates. After 2008-09, the tax rates were revised in 2015-16. Though BBMP Commissioners had tabled proposals to hike tax rates, they were all deferred.

Property tax is one of the largest revenue sources for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). Though the property tax rates have to be enhanced every three years, it seldom is approved by the elected body for various reasons.

With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the BBMP’s coffers have been running low, despite collection of around ₹2,060 crore in property tax.

Top 100 defaulters owe ₹131 crore

Meanwhile, the Revenue Department has drawn up a list of top 100 defaulters of property tax in the city, who owe the civic body nearly ₹131 crore. In all, the BBMP has to collect arrears amounting to ₹650 crore from property owners who have not paid tax for more than one year, sources said.

Though there are over 19.8 lakh properties in the city, many are yet to be brought under the property tax net. So far this fiscal, the BBMP has been able to collect ₹2,060 crore. To collect arrears, civic officials had issued nearly 22,000 warrants and notices to property owners, sources added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/3y9ooi/article32903458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGPROPERTYTAXP5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-mulls-granting-civic-chief-power-to-enhance-property-tax/article32903459.ece
330,2020/10/20,Motorist bids ₹10.75 lakh for fancy number,"Transport Department earns ₹18 lakh in first auction after lockdown

The economic impact of the pandemic has had little impact on the demand for fancy vehicle numbers. The Transport Department received its highest ever bid of ₹10.75 lakh for a fancy number – KA01 MV 0001 – during an auction that was conducted on Monday.

According to an official, the owner bid for the number for his Mercedes Benz. It includes a ₹75,000 fee fixed by the department.

The department auctioned various numbers, including ‘1’, ‘123’, ‘1234’, ‘7777’, ‘555’, ‘999’, ‘9090’ and ‘9999’.

“A total of 15 people made successful bids. The auction helped the department earn ₹18 lakh,” the official added.

The second highest bid was for registration number KA01 MV 9999, which was sold for ₹3.40 lakh. Another car owner paid ₹3 lakh for the number 0009.

An official of the Transport Department said, “Monday’s auction was the first one to happen after the imposition of lockdown, which has not affected the demand for fancy numbers.”

Buoyed by the success of the auction, the department is banking on demand to increase in the coming days. “Compared to other cities,demand for fancy numbers is higher in Bengaluru,” the official added.

As per the rule, bidders have till Wednesday to make the payment. If they fail to do so, they will forfeit the ₹75,000 fixed fee that they had to deposit prior to the auction.

Officials with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Tuesday arrested Kannada reality show ‘Bigg Boss’ contestant Adam Pasha in connection with their probe into the drug racket.

Adam has been accused of buying MDMA from a dealer, Anikha Dinesh, who had been arrested during a raid in August. “He has been sourcing drugs from Anikha Dinesh for a long time. We have evidence of financial transactions between the two and bank details,” a senior NCB official said.

In August, the NCB had carried out a series of raids in and around Bengaluru as part of an investigation into an international drug racket. Three people, including Anikha, were arrested at the time, and a cache of MDMA pills and LSD blots had been seized. Adam’s name cropped up during the probe after call record details showed his link to the accused.

According to NCB officials, Adam had close ties with Anikha. “He not only procured drugs from her, but also introduced many of his friends to her. We are ascertaining his exact role in the drug racket,” the NCB official added.

333,2020/10/20,SEC seeks HC nod to hold elections to 198 wards,"Poll body says process of creation of 243 wards would take at least 12 months

The State Election Commission (SEC) has sought direction from the Karnataka High Court to go ahead with the process initiated to hold elections to 198 awards of the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) by ignoring the government’s notification of increasing the number of wards to 243 following a recent amendment to the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act.

The SEC has filed an application in this regard in the PIL petition, filed by the Commission on January 23, 2020, seeking directions to the government to complete the process of delimitation of 198 wards and fix caste-based reservation in the wards.

Pointing out that valuable public time and money has already been spent since July this year for holding elections by preparing revised voters list to the 198 wards after the government on June 23 notified delimitation of 198 wards as per the court’s direction, the SEC has said that the amendment to the KMC Act cannot result in postponement of elections to be held within the time limit mandated in the constitutional provisions.

The SEC has brought to the court’s notice that after amending the KMC Act on October 3 to increase wards up to 250, the government on October 14 issued a notification fixing 243 wards for the BBMP and set up a delimitation commission, giving it six months to complete the process of carving out 243 new wards and fixing their boundaries.

As the process of delimitation of the new wards, fixation of caste-based reservation for the wards to-be-created, and preparation of new voter list would take at least 12 months. the SEC said not holding elections as per the process already undertaken would defeat the constitutional mandate of timely holding of elections to the BBMP. The SEC has pointed out that elections to the BBMP could not be completed before expiry of its term, on September 10, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

After pocketing the stolen ATM card, Kumar would withdraw cash and escape,” said a police officer.

They have to fall in line with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) guidelines, which limit the size of idols to four feet, restrict the number of food stalls to four, and prohibit public queues, among other things.

Barsha Bengali Association, based in HSR Layout, has planned to have most of the celebrations online. “The puja, pushpanjali and arati at Sidhartha Convention Hall will be streamed live on Youtube and Facebook,” says Priyanka Sinha Roy, a core committee member of Barsha. They have partnered with an FMCG company for an online food demonstration by some renowned chefs. “It will feature preparation of the best sweets from Kolkata during puja,” said Priyanka.

“There’s a special tribute to Satyajit Ray on his 100th anniversary, including live concerts, among other things,” she added.

The association has partnered with a delivery app to distribute the bhog prasad to its members. At the venue, it will employ a QR-code based registration app to track the number of attendees.

Sarathi Socio Cultural Trust in Koramangala, which claims to get over 1.5 lakh visitors every year, has decided to skip the celebrations. The trust, formed in 2003, will use its festival funds to help people, like idol-makers, whose livelihoods have been affected due to the restrictions on celebrations.

“Those who make the Durga and Ganesha idols, dhak (a percussion instrument used in puja celebrations) and a lot of others are out of work this year. So, we have decided to support them this year,” says Sudipto Das, general secretary of the trust.

Tarun Paul, an idol-maker from West Bengal, has been coming to Bengaluru since his father, Sudhir, started making idols in the city in 1971. He usually makes about 40 big idols of Durga and 125 Ganesha idols. This year, Tarun decided to stay in Bengal. “This is the first time in 50 years I will be missing the puja in Bengaluru,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fb605r/article32902538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGGROUNDP5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/festivities-go-online-in-low-key-durga-puja/article32902539.ece
336,2020/10/20,IMA scam: Three police officers suspended,"The CBI has also submitted a report to the State government against the accused officers seeking disciplinary action

Close on the heels of the CBI chargesheet filed against 28 people in the IMA scam, the State government on Saturday suspended three police officers on the charge of helping the prime accused Mohammed Mansoor Khan instead of taking action against him.

The CBI has also submitted a report to the State government against the accused officers seeking disciplinary action.

A letter issued by the Deputy Secretary of the Home Department states that Deputy Superintendent of Police, CID, E.B. Sridhara, the then Inspector M. Ramesh, and the then PSI of Commercial Street police station P. Gowrishankar have been suspended with immediate effect pending inquiry. The CBI had charged the officers of allegedly favouring Mansoor Khan instead of protecting the interest of investors and depositors. CBI investigations found that the officers submitted improper inquiry report and recommended no action against Mansoor Khan and IMA and in quid pro quo, received bribes and expensive gifts from IMA.

337,2020/10/20,COVID-19 testing to increase in outer zones,"Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said around 50,000 tests were being conducted every day in the city.

While the number of COVID-19 cases being reported were decreasing in core zones in the city, an increase was being reported in the five outer zones, especially Rajarajeshwarinagar.

Addressing reporters here on Monday, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said around 50,000 tests were being conducted every day in the city. The tests would be reallocated and targets of outer zones would be increased.

With the bypolls to Rajarajeshwarinagar scheduled on November 3, he said 50 additional marshals had been deployed to ensure citizens wear masks and maintain social distance.

He said testing was compulsory for primary and secondary contacts of COVID-19 patients, residents of containment zones and those diagnosed with Influenza-like Illness and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection. He said the civic body was also conducting free tests at labour camps and garment factories, where many people work in close proximity. “One case here may trigger a spread. To avoid this, we are conducting free tests. Labour camps and factories have to cooperate. Action will be taken against those not cooperating with the BBMP,” he warned.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wi86ls/article32887982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGCOVIDSTATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-testing-to-increase-in-outer-zones/article32896131.ece
338,2020/10/20,Complaints of citizens being asked for their voter ID details,"Ahead of the Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is receiving complaints from citizens about people contacting them seeking sensitive information, such as their voter identity card number. There have also been instances where citizens have reportedly been asked to hand over the photo identity cards.

Revealing that he too had received some anonymous messages from citizens, BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, who is also the District Election Officer, stated categorically that those seeking such information from citizens, those forcing citizens to hand over their voter identity cards, and those collecting these cards could land in jail.

“According to the Representation of People’s Act, this is a punishable offence that attracts one-year jail term,” he said and added that stringent action would be initiated against those found to be indulging in such activities, irrespective of the political party or candidate.

Mr. Prasad also said that he had apprised City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant of the same. The election squads had been directed to be vigilant about such incidents. Citizens, he said, may contact the control room or the returning officer concerned to lodge complaints about such instances.

Incidentally, just days ahead of the Assembly polls in May 2018, more than 9,500 EPICs (electoral photo identity cards) were seized from an apartment in Jalahalli, coming under Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituency. Then, BJP’s candidate Munirathna was contesting from the constituency on Congress ticket. Following the seizure, the Election Commission had deferred the election to later the same month, citing it a necessity for free and fair election. The BJP’s candidate then Muniraju Gowda had pointed fingers at Mr. Munirathna and alleged that it was clearly a case of inducing voters. However, Mr. Munirathna won that election and later on defected to the BJP, necessitating the bypoll in the constituency.

Meanwhile, Mr. Prasad said of the 678 polling stations, 79 had been identified as critical and 11 as vulnerable. A total of 4.62 lakh people were eligible to cast their vote in the bypoll.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ynwn5v/article32125860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGNMANJUNATHPRASADP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/complaints-of-citizens-being-asked-for-their-voter-id-details/article32896125.ece
339,2020/10/20,BDA increases fees for change of khata,"It has also enhanced fees for application, registration and penalty for vacant sites

The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) has increased application and registration fees of flat and site purchase and penalties, including the vacant site penalty. It has also increased the fee for change of khata and maintenance fee, which is collected along with property tax.

A senior official in the BDA told The Hindu that the move was done for “resource mobilisation”. “These fees and penalties were last revised in 2016,” the official said.

Vacant site penalty for a site with dimension 30×40 has been increased from the existing ₹80,000 to ₹1,20,000. For a site measuring more than 40×60 and less than 50×60, the vacant site penalty has been increased from ₹2,50,000 to ₹3,75,000. BDA has also introduced maintenance fees of ₹300 per month for 50×60 and ₹250 for 40×60 sites. The maintenance fees will be collected along with the property tax.

B.M. Shivakumar, president, Jayaprakash Narayan Vichara Vedike and an RTI activist, said that BDA should not have increased the penalty and application fee at a time when people were financially severely hit.

“They have nearly doubled fees and penalties. This was unwarranted at this time. BDA should mobilise resources through effective maintenance and management of its resources, clearing encroachments and other means and not by increasing fees and penalties. This will hit middle class people a lot,” he said.

‘Provide basic facilities’

Suryakiran A.S. of Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout Open-Forum urged the BDA to first provide basic facilities before imposing and increasing vacant site penalty. “BDA is charging high penalty but not providing any basic facility, including water and sanitary lines and transport. Secondly, people buy sites as an investment. After buying, they are made to pay such penalties and fees amounting to lakhs per year over and above the property and other taxes,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pode4l/article32896120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGPROPERTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bda-increases-fees-for-change-of-khata/article32896121.ece
340,2020/10/20,"BMTC, KSRTC defer plan to scrap old buses and induct new ones","Cash-strapped corporations are suffering huge revenue loss owing to pandemic

It will be a while before the city’s roads see new Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) buses being inducted. The cash-strapped transport corporation, which had planned to induct over 2,100 new buses and scrap close to 1,000 old ones, has now delayed the plan after suffering revenue loss of over ₹900 crore owing to the pandemic.

The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) too has postponed scrapping of old buses. Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, the KSRTC had planned for induction of 1,000 new buses and scrapping of 700 to 800 old ones.

Managing Director of KSRTC Shivyogi C. Kalasad said: “The pandemic has hit hard the finances of the corporations. We are not in a position to add a new fleet at least till December. If everything goes well, we may go for induction of buses in the beginning of the next calendar year.”

“Due to the pandemic, we are not operating the entire fleet of buses. The ridership is low compared to the pre-lockdown period. We are augmenting existing resources to meet the demand. We have to delay scrapping of buses till the induction of new buses,” he added.

The KSRTC has a fleet size of 8,600 buses. Earlier, the corporation was scrapping an ordinary bus after it crossed 10 lakh km operations and 13 lakh km in case of AC bus.

The BMTC officials said despite relaxation of lockdown, ridership remains low. Prior to the lockdown, the corporation was generating ₹5 crore revenue per day, which has now dropped to ₹1.8 crore. Unable to bear the expenses, the BMTC has again knocked on the door of the State government to pay the salary of the staff. A majority of AC buses have remained off the road for close to seven months.

“For the current financial year, there was a plan to induct 2,100-odd buses. But loss of revenue has forced postponement. As a result, scrapping of buses also needs to be delayed. However, buses that are in a bad condition have to be scrapped. This year, we might have scrapped 40-odd buses,” an official said.

In the last three years, the BMTC has inducted 1,700 new buses and scrapped 1,383 old ones. The official said induction of new buses may happen in the next financial year. It is not only the ordinary buses. BMTC’s plan to operate 300 e-buses on lease is facing hurdles as well. The corporation got a deadline extension to float the tender recently by the Union government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/puf5mm/article32896110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bmtc-ksrtc-defer-plan-to-scrap-old-buses-and-induct-new-ones/article32896111.ece

343,2020/10/20,Gang of women from Thoothukudi arrested in Chennai for robbing senior citizens,"Police said the women would divert the attention of elderly people, and rob them of their valuables

In a major operation, the city police rounded up a gang of seven women allegedly involved in a series of attention-diversion offences targeting senior citizens at bus stops and crowded places, at several places in Chennai.

In the past two days, at least 15 incidents of thefts -- of valuables after the diversion of attention of senior citizens, and bag-lifting -- were reported in Thiruvottriyur, New Washemenpet, R.K. Nagar, Villivakkam, Esplanade, Flower Bazaar, Basin Bridge, and Egmore police stations. The police registered cases for theft and cheating.

Joint Commissioner of Police, North V. Balakrishnan told The Hindu, “Following complaints, we constituted special teams to trace the suspects. After analysing the pattern of offences, we short-listed photographs of criminals involved in similar crimes and scrutinised CCTV footage and the call records of suspects. Our women police constables were deployed in plainclothes on surveillance duty at bus stops and in crowded shopping areas, which were the potential target areas of criminals. After working on several leads, we traced the suspects who were staying at a rented house in KK. Nagar and arrested seven women and recovered 200 grams of gold from them,” he said.

The seven women: K. Rani, 28, R. Thilaga, 31, V. Rajamani, 50, K. Mariya 33, S. Esakiammal, 27, M. Lakshmi, 40 and T. Usha, 34 hailing from Manthi Thoppe, Thoouthukudi were remanded in judicial custody.

Explaining the modus operandi, a police officer said, “The gang targeted only senior citizens standing at bus stops. For instance, they would come in an autorickshaw and offer a lift after convincing the victim that no bus would come in the COVID-19 pandemic period. After the victim was seated between two of them, one would speak to the victim casually, while the other would remove their gold thali, once the victim’s attention was diverted.”

“To prevent further occurrence of crimes, we have taken all steps and have convened a meeting of autorickshaw drivers to request them to pass on any clues,” Mr. Balakrishnan said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ifhrwn/article32900695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20OCTTH--ARREST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gang-of-women-from-thoothukudi-arrested-in-chennai-for-robbing-senior-citizens/article32900696.ece

Chennai Corporation officials sealed the Kumaran Silks showroom in T. Nagar Tuesday morning. The textile showroom was sealed for overcrowding, and for failing to maintain COVID-19 regulations -- the enforcing of physical distancing norms, and mask wearing among customers.

A senior official of the Corporation’s Kodambakkam zone said complaints were received about huge crowds thronging the Kumaran Silks showroom on Sunday, and the showroom officials failed to implement any measures to control the crowd. With the city still under a lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the crowding at the showroom would raise the threat of spreading the virus among its visitors.

Last week, Balaji Sampath, founder of AhaGuru, a coaching centre for the Joint Engineering Examination and NEET, received a call from D. Rajvee, seeking an appointment for his son, Muhender Raj. “He wanted to get our blessings,” said Mr. Balaji.

Mr. Muhender has scored 100 percentile in JEE (Mains) and is ranked 4th in the country. Since he took the test from Kota in Rajasthan, he is considered a Delhi zone student.

Mr. Muhender is a resident of Royapettah, who began his schooling in DAV Gopalapuram and later shifted to Maharshi Vidya Mandir in Class 9. Mr. Rajvee is an alumnus of Anna University.

During his travel by autorickshaw to school, Muhender would listen to his seniors discuss the periodic table. He began reading up on the internet and soon could recite the entire table. At school, principal Shanthy Asokan invited him to perform the feat, which he did in two minutes. She urged his parents to motivate him to hone his abilities.

The parents sought out AhaGuru, where he studied until he entered Class 11. “He was doing all our courses one year ahead of the rest of the class. Last year, he finished our entire JEE programme and as he had a whole year of preparation left he moved to Kota. So I lost touch,” said Mr. Balaji.

Three months into Class 11, Muhender, along with his mother and sister, shifted to Kota to prepare for JEE. In 2019, he won a silver medal in the International Chemistry Olympiad in Paris.

346,2020/10/20,Demand for suburban train services growing,"Commuters ask for its resumption

Thousands of office-goers in the southern and western suburbs want the State government to take steps to allow resumption of suburban train services.

Citing the running of the suburban train services in Mumbai without much COVID-19 spread, residents said the suburban trains, which are run for staff involved in essential services and government departments, should be thrown open to the public at least during peak hours.

The suburban trains remained the only transport option for lakhs of residents in the city and nearby districts. With the restarting of bus services by the State government from September 1, residents had hoped for the Southern Railway to also resume suburban trains. Those commuting to the city from far-flug places like Arakkonam, Tiruvallur, Thiruninravur, Pattabhiram, Chengalpattu and Perungalathur are annoyed at the delay in the resumption.

A. Roy Rozario, an office-bearer of the Railway Passengers Association Pattabhiram and a retired official of Southern Railway, said the suburban train service was the lifeline for thousands of office-goers and daily wage earners travelling from places like Arakkonam, Tiruvallur and Thiruninravur.

347,2020/10/20,Safety norms largely ignored in T. Nagar,"Residents living in bylanes off Usman Road fear overcrowding could lead to a spike in infections

With Deepavali approaching, residents of Motilal Street in T. Nagar and other alleys abutting Usman Road are worried that the already crowded area would be inundated with shoppers.

The lanes have already become narrow due to haphazard parking and the residents want the police and Greater Chennai Corporation to regulate parking as heavy rush in the central shopping district can cause a spike in the number of cases, especially among residents.

There are over 1,000 families living on Natesan Street, Ramanathan Street, Rangan Street, Mangesh Street, Pinjala Subramaniam Street, Venkatesan Street, Motilal Street, Mahalakshmi Street and other lanes on either side of Usman Road. Many of these residents are senior citizens.

“The elderly are not able to step out of their homes as two-wheelers whiz past constantly and there are too many vehicles parked on the road. Due to overcrowding, they seldom step out fearing that they will get infected,” said V.S. Jayaraman, member, T. Nagar Residents Welfare Association.

Residents said commercial establishments in the locality had not made provision for parking space for shoppers.

“The main menace is bike parking. They are parked on both sides of the road and the 30-feet road has hardly 10 feet space left. As vehicles are parked in front of apartment gates, many residents are not able to take their vehicles out. This will worsen during holidays, Deepavali and other festival seasons,” added another resident.

Residents say that although they had informed the police about the problem, action had not been taken on the issue.

“We request the traffic police to tow away the vehicles which are found parked on the streets abutting Usman Road. Such haphazard parking should be monitored. Although there is a paid parking facility in Motilal Street, its staff make motorists park bikes on the road and collect hourly charges from them,” said a resident who has been living in the locality for 50 years.

Pavements occupied

B. Kannan, secretary, T. Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, said that even the pavements on Usman Road were not spared.

“Bikes are parked and hawkers have occupied the platform, leaving no space for pedestrians. The police and the Corporation are not willing to take action. Many do not wear masks and personal distancing is not followed in many shops and hotels. Arrangements should be made to open shops on alternate days to avoid crowding,” he said.

The number of COVID-19 containment zones in the city has come down to 29, with Ambattur zone remaining free of such streets.

The Greater Chennai Corporation, which resumed barricading of streets in the first week of October after COVID-19 positive cases started increasing, had at one time blocked 70 streets.

349,2020/10/20,Love in the time of polarisation,"The withdrawn Tanishq commercial is a victim of an unrepresentative exclusivism that fosters old social orthodoxies

A new front has opened in the culture wars occurring in India. After silencing academics and print journalists, conquering TV news channels, maligning the Mumbai film industry, the trolls have made advertising the new battlefield. The release of the Tata-owned Tanishq advertisement was followed by a manic backlash with complaints about hurt Hindu sentiment, threats of violence, and its abrupt withdrawal. These threats were not empty; showrooms in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh were visited by goons demanding a written apology.

Message and the attack

What is the advertisement trying to communicate and what is hurtful about it? An affluent Muslim family is seen organising a baby shower for their Hindu daughter-in-law. Marriage brings unanticipated tensions for the families of the couple, and a particularly profound disturbance in the life of the woman who often moves into the home of her husband. Without an entire network of support led by the husband and the mother-in-law, this transition is painful. In the advertisement, the Muslim mother-in-law arranges a Hindu ritual, affectionately puts her arm around her surprised daughter-in-law and says that the custom of loving a daughter far outweighs the demands of religious tradition.

Also read: Tanishq store in Gujarat puts up apology note over withdrawn ad

Playing upon vile communal instincts, the trolls attacked it for its ‘secular’ message. One extremist reason they offer is “love jihad”, allegedly a design to marry Hindu women with the sole objective of multiplying Muslim numbers and change India’s demography. This is why these marriages, they say, are not a personal or family matter but concern the community, and offend its morality. This intolerance of Hindu-Muslim marriage is entirely politically constructed. Instances abound of such marriages being turned into hell, at least in the initial years, by politically encouraged intolerance. The trolling must be seen in the context of a long-standing practice of politically triggered harassment of inter-religious couples.

A less hysterical reason is embedded in the assumption that the compatibility of two individuals due to their class, education and temperament is trumped by the natural incompatibility between a Hindu and a Muslim. This explains the social wrath against inter-faith marriages, particularly between Hindu women and Muslim men. There is something in this argument: if conversion and a change of the bride’s name is made a condition of inter-religious marriages, then an objection against it is understandable. But this is not always true. In any case, this advertisement emphasises that the young woman remains a Hindu. This should take the wind out of the sails of the objector. If it does not, it is because of a third reason: the impregnable belief that inter-religious marriages go against incontestable social norms. Thus, for one ‘realist analyst’, the advertisement proves the disconnect of secular elites from Indian social norms. How unrealistic to expect that Indians will tolerate inter-religious marriage, when social norms do not permit even inter-caste marriages within Hindus, Muslims or Christians?

Also read: Congress leaders hit out at trolls forcing withdrawal of Tanishq advertisement

Moreover, inter-faith marriages are never arranged. The advertisement then appears to celebrate not only communal harmony but ‘love marriage’, individual choice, and the new egalitarian family that respects the distinctive identity and wishes of women. This provides an additional ground for conservative anger. Covertly, the trolls prey upon social anxieties surrounding the young falling in love, rebelling against the rigid traditions of community, and giving women equal respect. The backlash against inter-faith marriages comes from communalism’s juxtaposition with this asphyxiating conservatism.

At odds with reality

This deeply conservative general portrayal of Indians is a simplistic myth, at odds with the ever-changing, equally Indian social reality. Large towns and cities generate conditions for a partial collapse of the old community-dominated order. Public transport, the work-place, restaurants, malls, educational institutions — all facilitate and encourage inter-caste and inter-religious intermingling. This real and virtual proximity generates conflict as well as opportunity for friendship that can transform into love and even marriage no matter how much it enrages the socially orthodox and intolerant. No society has ever managed to completely control the emotional life of individuals. ‘Love marriages’ have a long ancestry. Even the Dharamshastras acknowledge and endorse love marriage at least for the Kshatriyas — the Gandharva Vivaha. The epics speak of Kshatriya women choosing their husbands too. Indian films build upon such long standing socio-mythical archetypes and frequently support individual choice and love as the only basis for marriage. Given this counter-current against caste and community-based arranged marriages, is it surprising that the young dream of falling in love and marrying the person of their choice?

Not a general trait

Moreover, the older generation is not as stubborn as is assumed. At least in metropolitan cities, the initial period of social boycott and disapproval gives way to acceptance, forgiveness, accommodation and reconciliation, particularly after couples have children. Many understand that beyond a point they cannot impose their own will on consenting adults. To ignore this fact portrays Indians as unalterable, heartless bigots for whom traditional custom has insuperable priority over love, which is an inaccurate depiction. A fanatical commitment to religious dogma may be common among habitual haters of other communities but this a hardly a general trait of all Indians.

In short, social intolerance of inter-religious marriages exists but is exaggerated by the trolls. What then is the springboard of this intolerance and hostility? This is driven by the ambition of new power elites out to displace older ones. A minority within the majority community is forcing itself on everyone by claiming to be the voice of the people. It uses the rhetoric of ‘the people’, because in democracy, anyone who claims the backing of the larger number gains social and political power. If mass opinion matters, large political benefits can be had from passing off a sectarian view as mass opinion. If a choice is to be made between curbing the voice of corporates or of “the people”, as one television commentator put it, one must curb corporate voice. In reality, this wrath and hate is manufactured by a predominantly, male-dominated discourse of new elites with a surfeit of power and money. Love jihad is part of this discourse.

There are two stories

In this polarised climate, it takes courage by a commercial enterprise to convey a message of understanding, acceptance, love and communal harmony. Instead of supporting it, most electronic and social media have openly chastised this effort. The Indian state has stood by passively; at best as a silent witness and at worse as irresponsibly backing the disruptors

Much is at stake in India today. Not just communal harmony but also individual freedom, gender equality, and freedom of speech, besides economic freedom and equality. Capitalist markets have many drawbacks but they allow buying and selling irrespective of a person’s religion, ideology, race, colour and sexual preferences. The withdrawal of the advertisement undermines principles of freedom and equality associated with a safe business environment.

It is not true that all Indians are resistant to social change or that Hindus are inveterate Muslim-haters. Ground reports on ordinary people tell two stories, not one as the trolls and their followers would have us believe.

There is a vast difference in the role of a Governor in the ‘Old India’ and the ‘New India’. In fact I recall the book, The Governor, Sage or Saboteur, by Soli. J. Sorabjee. Present-day Governors appear to have specific assignments — to destabilise non-BJP ruled States. Ultimately, federalism has been systematically trampled upon, undermining democracy, secularism and the freedom of expression, and subjugating all constitutional bodies(Editorial page, “The Raj Bhavan’s new role — taking centre stage”, October 19).

Governors too are politicians on a ‘temporary’ sabbatical. Perhaps the gubernatorial post in all States should henceforth be held by a retired High Court or Supreme Court judge so that he or she will act within the letter and spirit of the Constitution. By and large, retired judges are apolitical. And, for Governors with a judicial background, discharging constitutional duties will be child’s play.

Downward graph

While it is encouraging that the number of active COVID-19 cases and deaths being reported daily appears to be decreasing, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the next three months will be a defining moment for India in its pandemic fight. The challenge lies in making the general public to be compliant with simple precautionary measures. The festive season along with winter problems can change the course of the virus’s spread. At this moment India cannot afford to lower its guard in the anti-virus war.

Amend the IPL rule

Once the first super over also ends in a tie, equal points could be given to both teams. This will not only set at rest confusion created over who should bat or bowl from each team in the second super over, but will also be fair to both the contestants and save time. It is high time the rules were amended (‘Sport’ page, “Kings rule after incredible finish”, October 19).

351,2020/10/20,‘MVA govt. should first extend relief to rain-affected farmers’,"Fadnavis criticises State for passing the buck of providing financial aid to Centre

Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday targeted the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for not yet announcing a relief package for rain-hit farmers in the State and tossing the ball into the Centre’s court to provide financial assistance.

After surveying rain-hit regions in Osmanabad district, Mr. Fadnavis said, “It is high time the Uddhav Thackeray government stops playing politics over financial aid and shows sensitivity towards the plight of farmers. It has become the norm for the MVA leadership to point a finger at the Centre if anything happens.”

He added, “Now the Prime Minister himself has called the Chief Minister and told him clearly that we [the Centre and the State] are together in this disaster. He has promised any help Maharashtra needs. In the meantime, the State should first extend some relief to the farmers on an urgent basis.”

Mr. Fadnavis pulled out a video clip of Chief Minister Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar dismissing his announcement of a ₹10,000 crore package for farmers after the unseasonal rains in November 2019.

In the video, Mr. Thackeray demanded that Mr. Fadnavis {the then caretaker Chief Minister) give immediate assistance of ₹25,000 to 50,000 per hectare to every afflicted farmer, while Mr. Pawar dubbed the relief package a “pittance”.

Mr. Fadnavis said, “This is an ideal opportunity for Mr. Thackeray and Mr. Pawar to fulfil their promises as they are in power today. Last year, even though I was a caretaker Chief Minister, I immediately announced a relief of ₹10,000 crore for farmers without waiting for the Centre. I see no such action by Mr. Thackeray’s government when faced with a similar crisis today.”

The BJP leader said while he was in no mood for ‘political talk’ during a crisis, the MVA government is persisting in politicising the issue.

“It is said that where there is a will, there is a way. But where there is no will, there is only a survey and this government seems to lack all willpower… while I don’t want to play politics, I am astonished at the amount of politicisation done by ruling party leaders,” he said.

Mr. Fadnavis approved of Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar’s suggestion to borrow loans to tackle the economic crisis and damage to crops wrought by the retreating monsoon. He said, “Mr. Pawar has said of the long time it takes for the Centre’s aid to reach the State. The committee on deciding the relief package is headed by the Home Minister, with the Agriculture and Finance Ministers as its members. First the State has to assess the damage and send a memorandum. Then a Central team conducts its survey in the State. The team will present its report to the Centre, based on which the committee recommends the relief package. So it is a long-drawn-out procedure.”

“This year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has fixed a limit of ₹1.20 lakh crore for States to borrow. Maharashtra till now has only borrowed ₹60,000 crore in loans. So, there is no question of taking overdraft or exceeding RBI limits to borrow more,” he said.

Mr. Fadnavis said despite the States having a provision for doling out relief under the State Disaster Response Fund, the Chief Minister had not announced anything yet. He said while the three MVA allies had internal differences, they were united in passing the buck of providing relief aid to the Centre.

On Monday, Mr. Thackeray, during his visit to rain-hit areas in Solapur district, said that the Maharashtra government has not yet announced a relief package because the retreating monsoon is not yet over and the India Meteorological Department has predicted more showers this week.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/57qsak/article32886182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEVENDRAFADNAVIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mva-govt-should-first-extend-relief-to-rain-affected-farmers/article32904074.ece
352,2020/10/20,"Centre must pay GST dues worth ₹30,000 crore: Thorat","State has raised ₹55,000 crore for paying salaries and other expenses through loans

State Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat on Tuesday said the Centre must help Maharashtra fight COVID-19 and provide relief to rain-hit farmers by paying GST dues worth ₹30,000 crore.

“Maharashtra is in a financial crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Central government should extend a helping hand in the current situation, where heavy rains have caused large scale damage, but it has not done so yet,” he said.

The State government is also yet to receive its rightful GST refund worth ₹30,000 crore till the end of September. The Centre should clear this outstanding amount at the earliest,” said Mr. Thorat.

He said the State has raised ₹55,000 crore for paying salaries and other expenses through loans. “Maharashtra pays the highest taxes to the Centre, but it is always reluctant to step up and help the State. Despite this, the State government stands firmly behind its farmers and will surely help them,” he said.

The State Congress chief criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders for making huge demands, but not taking the efforts to get the State’s pending GST dues from the Centre. “Apart from the GST refund, they should also use their relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in getting the maximum financial assistance for the State. If they do this, we will welcome and congratulate them,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/centre-must-pay-gst-dues-worth-30000-crore-thorat/article32904053.ece

The PIL filed by advocate Sujay Joshi from Pune, through advocate Ajinkya Udane, urges the court to take judicial notice of its space crunch to store documents, records and files. “This court also initiated the process of scanning and digitisation of records of high court and district and subordinate courts in Maharashtra,” the PIL said.

354,2020/10/20,Court acquits 20 foreign attendees of Tablighi event,"‘No iota of evidence with prosecution to show any contravention of orders beyond all shadow of doubt’

Ruling that “there is no iota of evidence”, a magistrate court in Andheri acquitted 20 foreign attendees of a Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi who were booked by the Mumbai Police for allegedly violating lockdown rules.

Metropolitan magistrate R.R. Khan said, “The witnesses were not found in a position to tell where and how the accused were residing at the time of the alleged offence. Thus, there is no iota of evidence with prosecution to show any contravention of order beyond all shadow of doubt. During the imposition of lockdown, their taking ultimate shelter in a mosque or nearby will not render them responsible for such contravention.”

The court said there is “no legal evidence adduced by the prosecution to show that the accused infringed on the notification lawfully made under the Bombay Police Act.” It also directed them to furnish bonds of ₹10,000.

At 10 a.m. on March 29, informant SI Durgesh Harishchandra Salunkhe along with his associates visited Tayyaba Masjid, in front of Andheri subway, and came to know that 10 foreigners from the Kyrgyz Republic had arrived at the mosque after attending the Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz in Delhi. The informant said they visited various places and people, spreading the COVID-19 infection. He claimed that they violated lockdown norms and infringed upon the orders of the City Police Commissioner.

The court said, “From the combined perusal of evidence of police officials and the prosecution, it is apparent that both of them have deposed that the accused have not committed violations of lockdown or curfew. Additionally, they have deposed that they neither entered the mosque nor noticed accused contravening lockdown norms. Ultimately, the prosecution witnesses themselves have clarified the position of the accused persons.”

They were charged under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life, shall be punished), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), along with relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act, Epidemic Diseases Act and Bombay Police Act.

Later, Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 304 (2) (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC were added.

A division bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik heard the criminal petition filed by Mr. Sawant, 25, through advocates Ravindra Rathore and Aamir Koradia. He has been out on bail since October 7.

The petition states that on the statement of Kaizan Ebrahim, he was arrested on September 4 and taken in NCB custody at 10 p.m. He was produced before the holiday magistrate court after more than 36 hours, on September 6. The next day, Mr. Ebrahim was granted bail. He, however, continued to remain in custody till September 9. Soon thereafter, he was granted judicial custody. The sessions court rejected his bail enough though all offences are bailable, the petition points out.

The plea mentions that Mr. Sawant’s brother, Vivek, wrote to the Chief Justice of the High Court and other authorities on September 5 about the ‘illegal’ detention. There is absolutely no recovery of any contraband at the instance of Mr. Sawant and there is absolutely no nexus between him and any contraband of commercial quantity. He has been falsely framed and there is no evidence to charge him for offences under the Narcotics Drugs Psychotropic Substances Act, the plea states.

356,2020/10/20,APMC traders import 600 tonnes of onions from Iran,"With the price of onions increasing, traders at the APMC market in Vashi have imported around 600 tonnes of onions from Iran, which reached the JNPT port on Monday. While some of them have been taken to the APMC market, some will be taken to Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

“Around 25 tonnes of the 600 tonnes have been brought to the APMC market. Those have been sold at ₹51 per kg in wholesale while the Indian onions are priced between ₹60 and ₹70,” Abdul Razak Memon, a trader from APMC market, said.

Mr. Memon said more onions are expected from Egypt by the last week of October. “We had ordered the onions from Iran around 25 days ago. The process from Iran is slow and the payment methods are also tedious. Instead, we would be importing onions from Egypt. Onions from Turkey are also imported. This time, the rate there is also at the higher side and hence, we are going with Egypt,” he said.

He said that last year, the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) too had got onions from Turkey.

On Monday, around 79 vehicles with 13,722 sacks of Indian onions entered the APMC market. They are sold up to ₹80 per kg in retail.

359,2020/10/20,Captaincy will decide the winner of the IPL,"This goes against prevailing wisdom — that of all formats of the game, it is in the shortest that the captain has the least role to play.

It is permutations and combinations time at the IPL. Teams in the bottom-half of the table are busy working out what the other teams have to do to help them sneak into the knockouts. This is, of course, assuming that they themselves win all their matches from here on.

This is a difficult phase for the sums man in a team. He has to reduce everything to: “If A beats B and C loses to D by less than 20 runs and we win by three wickets and hope that F wins but by a margin of 12 runs or by one wicket….” Someone is making just these calculations as you read this. Others are making deals with the Almighty.

Bottom-placed Chennai Super Kings have lost most matches, seven, in the league so far. It must be a strange place for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to view the tournament from. He has admitted it is all over for his team, and expressed unhappiness over some of the younger players (“lacked spark”).

Dhoni under the lens

This is unusual for Dhoni, and indicates just how badly the results have affected him. He is not usually given to blaming the younger players. CSK are hit by withdrawals and injuries, but they seldom looked a champion side. Questions will be asked about Dhoni’s own form, and his captaincy decisions. Is the end of the team the end of their captain too?

Perhaps there is a call here for Dhoni to give up the captaincy and play with the kind of freedom that has been missing from his game. His legacy is secure, after all. Kolkata Knight Riders has shown the way, elevating Eoin Morgan and taking the responsibility off Dinesh Karthik’s shoulders.

Captaincy might well decide the winner of this year’s IPL. This goes against prevailing wisdom — that of all formats of the game, it is in the shortest that the captain has the least role to play. For one, the game moves too fast, and those sitting in the dugout might have a better picture overall. For another, the top bowlers like to set their own fields, and don’t depend too much on the captain’s inputs.

But for these very same reasons, the captaincy is crucial too. When things move fast, it is the man in charge at the pitch who is in the best position to make the calls. Mistakes are made, which is only human. An unfit Andre Russell bowls the last over in one game, a super fit A.B. de Villiers is held back when his team is chasing in another. All captains make mistakes. A good captain makes fewer of them.

Sometimes the captain can make the right call which leads to the wrong result (for his team); occasionally it is the other way around, when a blatantly wrong decision leads to a surprisingly positive result. It is like a spinner getting a wicket off a rank bad ball. Such things happen.

But as the tournament progresses, and the knockout picture depends on inches and decimal points and the odd moment of brilliant out-cricket, the captain’s role becomes increasingly important. Field placings are crucial; captains must understand angles and arcs on the field. Where do you place your fastest fielders, how many do you need behind the wicket? That might sound basic, but you will be surprised how many get it wrong.

The placement of fielders is one of the most fascinating aspects of a short game. The formation can change by the over, as the batsmen change ends, and as the restrictions come and go. What is logical in the first six overs is not so in the next six or the six after that.

Rahul impresses

Of the five Indian captains in the IPL this year, Kings XI Punjab’s K.L. Rahul has been impressive. He opens the batting, keeps wickets, and has to make the final calls in tight games. He seems to be enjoying it, and that’s always a good sign. This is also the only team where both captain and coach (Anil Kumble) are from India.

There are too many things happening for one man to retain everything in his head, hence the support staff. The captain-coach relationship can be fascinating too. Few coaches are likely to go against a strong captain when it might mean a loss of earnings the following year.

Will Stephen Fleming, one of the best in the game, tell Dhoni, for instance, that the time has come for him to step down? They go back a long way, and have been a successful pair, after all.

It was said in a different context, but David Warner’s reaction to the defeat against Kolkata is symbolic: “I want to bite my tongue,” he said, “to stop from saying something harsh.” To whom?

The pressure is on the captains now.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ouvx35/article32700051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DHONI,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/captaincy-will-decide-the-winner-of-the-ipl/article32903292.ece
360,2020/10/20,Technology to nature’s rescue,"Perhaps there’s nothing more synthetic than technology among the many products of human creativity. But today this very technology plays a crucial role in preserving the natural world and advancing wildlife conservation. Here are a few ways in which this is being done

Camera trap

One can be forgiven for looking down on the humble camera trap - after all, this automated device has been around for decades. But one would be hard-pressed to find a simpler yet effective device used in wildlife research and conservation.

Though it began life as a device requiring films, today it has grown to be digital, sending real-time images and taking videos too.

Most commonly used to document the presence of elusive wildlife, the potential of camera traps has expanded over the years. Camera traps and videos have been used to study and document several species from arboreal mammals to fast-flying humming birds.

The devices have also helped study the likes of bats hibernating in the dark. The bonus? The images and videos of what is called a “bycatch” - species that were not the intended targets!

Acoustic sensors

While camera traps help through visuals, acoustic sensors help through sounds. After all, aren’t birds and animals also vocal? These automated monitoring devices can record sounds for a long time - helping researchers not just ascertain the presence of animals and birds but also analyse the data gathered to learn about the ecosystem, population density, change in wildlife behaviour and even human interference.

It is said that these devices are especially “useful for aerial and underwater species”. According to Mongabay, a non-profit environmental science and conservation news platform, researchers in Mexico were able to detect the decreasing number of vaquitas (a species of porpoise) through acoustic monitoring of their home in the Gulf of California.

Interestingly, journal Nature reported how acoustic recordings provide detailed information on wildlife behaviour during conservation translocations too - through a study that tested the efficacy of a collar-mounted acoustic recording unit to remotely monitor the behaviour of panda mothers and their dependent young.

Stem cells

In March 2018, the last male of the northern white rhinoceros died. Though the species is on the brink of extinction - there are only two ageing females left on the planet - not all hope is lost. The highly advanced technology of stem cells could still save the species, feel scientists.

Stem cells can become any cell in the body. And this process “involves researchers removing cells from frozen rhino tissue, which would be ‘reprogrammed’ into stem cells that would then become sperm and eggs”. And the resulting union has the potential to give rise to an embryo of the northern white rhino. It sounds like a rather simple plan but its execution is not without complexities (such as finding a healthy female to implant the embryo in). So, though realising this dream could be years away, this technology does revive hope for many such species on the brink of extinction.

Drones, AI, sirens and more...

This illustration of a Vaquita Marina, provided by Greenpeace, shows an image of the highly endangered sea mammal swimming in the sea. Mexicoâ€™s president, its richest man and actor Leonardo DiCaprio have signed an agreement that aims to protect marine ecosystems in the upper Gulf of California where the vaquita porpoise is critically endangered. (Greenpeace via AP)

After habitat loss, the greatest threat to biodiversity comes in the form of illegal wildlife trade, affecting not just animals but plants too. And at the heart of this illegal trade lie poachers. With many wildlife reserves having to make do with a limited number of rangers, it’s drones that come in handy to watch out for or thwart poachers.

Also Read Forest department uses drones to monitor wild elephants

Fitted with heat-sensitive infra-red optics (which can easily spot warm-blooded mammals - including humans - even at night), these drones become particularly helpful to spot poachers who usually work stealthily under the cover of darkness.

In fact, reports suggest that drones played an invaluable role in forest surveillance during the lockdown in our country. More help in anti-poaching initiatives come in the form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. AI systems combined with cameras are known to help rangers detect and stop poachers before they strike, and even predict where poachers are most likely to strike.

Facial recognition software too have been used to identify injured animals of a group, especially among endangered species, that could fall prey to poaching. Interestingly, sirens are useful too - not just to ward off poachers. A study has shown that sirens were effective in keeping rhinos off problem areas such as perimeter fences where poachers are likely to strike. By establishing such avoidance behaviours in animals, technology can aid in anti-poaching efforts at relatively low costs, the study indicated.

Social media

In today’s world where hashtags create mass global movements, the role of social media in environment conservation is as huge as it is indispensable. Pictures, videos, content and data shared widely on many social media platforms generate not just curiosity but also awareness and conversations around conservation.

From reports of palm oil-induced habitat destruction to debates on the government’s new policies on the environment, information is shared widely at the click of a button. More importantly, reports suggest that the younger generation learns a lot about the natural world and its conservation through the virtual world.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/w025z6/article32899414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15ISBSCAMERA,https://www.thehindu.com/children/technology-to-natures-rescue/article32899417.ece

The organisation focusses on making books accessible to children in rural areas.

“We distribute books to 2,200 children through 25 mobile libraries across the State. We have tied up with an NGO called Centre for Justice and Peace to distribute books in 14 villages including Vepparai and Vadakku Paramedu in Pollachi,” says Karthikeyan T, the founder.

Dulkal was set up in 2019 in Chennai with a core team of five professionals from various fields including engineering, IT and education. “Our first project was a school library at Anayeri village in Tiruvannamalai,” says Karthikeyan. Initially, volunteers from the organisation pooled in money to buy books. Gradually, they started getting support from donors and, over the next two months, collected over 1,000 books. “Soon, we did a similar project at Vengalathur Government High School in Kanchipuram,” says Karthikeyan. The NGO has a team to select age-appropriate short stories, novels, magazines and biographies in Tamil and English for children of ages four to 18. “Our school libraries can also be accessed by children living in nearby villages. We have teachers who volunteer to maintain the register and conduct regular sessions on storytelling, art and craft and simple science experiments for kids in the locality,” he says.

After lockdown Dulkal introduced the concept of mobile libraries. “With children unable to go to school due to the pandemic, we decided to take books to their homes. We identified rural communities and got volunteers from the locality. Each takes around 200 books with them during a visit to the village,” he explains. Once read, the books are returned to the volunteer to be redistributed in another village. “These engagements are also important to prevent students from dropping out of school,” he adds.

In addition to setting up libraries, the Dulkal team creates audio books for visually-challenged children. “We have completed around 50 books so far. We also organise weekly online book talks where we discuss a particular book,” says Karthikeyan. They have also set up a call centre for the LGBTQI+ community in association with Aniyam Foundation to help with their psychological, legal and medical needs. The team is now working on creating community libraries in Gummidipoondi and Palavakkam near Chennai. “We are planning to curate 2,000 books and hope to open the libraries by December,” he says.

364,2020/10/20,Tiruchi-Karur highway stretch widening to be over by March,"Project involves building of retaining walls for a length of 1,785 m

Work on widening and strengthening the narrow and accident-prone stretch of road between Tiruchi and Thindukarai on Tiruchi-Karur Highway is expected to be completed by March next.

Although the work, which began in May-end, is scheduled to be completed by November next, efforts are on to complete it ahead of deadline, Collector S. Sivarasu said after inspecting the progress of work on Tuesday.

“So far, 55% of the work has been completed and the remaining works are fast apace. We are targetting to complete the project by March,” he told reporters at the site.

Widening of the 11-km stretch — marked by sharp and dangerous curves — running between the Cauvery and Tiruchi-Karur railway line was taken up after persistent demands from suburban residents as accidents became frequent on the stretch.

The work was sanctioned last year at an estimate of ₹55 crore under the Comprehensive Road Infrastructure Development Programme 2019-20. The road is being widened from its present width of seven metres to up to 10.5 metres. Some of the dangerous curves will also be straightened.

The project also involves construction of retaining walls for a length of about 1,785 metres, protective walls along the bank of the Cauvery for a length of 3,895 metres, revetment inside the river bund for a length of 350 metres and drains for a length of 971 metres.

Mr. Sivarasu, who also inspected construction of a new bypass road around Manachanallur, said nearly 75% of the work had been completed and the road would be declared open to traffic soon.

The bypass runs a length of about 2.64 km and was sanctioned at an estimated cost of ₹25.15 crore. The greenfield road involved construction of 14 box culverts and three minor bridges. Besides, junction improvements were also made at five places.

Service lane

To a query on land acquisition for laying service lanes along the city stretch of Tiruchi-Thanjavur Highway between Palpannai and Thuvakudi, Mr. Sivarasu said the process would be completed by January. The National Highways Authority of India would take up work on laying the service lanes once 90% of the land was acquired and handed over.

Land acquisition for the semi-ring road between Panchapur on Tiruchi-Madurai Highway and Thindukarai on Tiruchi- Karur Highway would be completed by March. Once the land was acquired, it would take about 24 months for the road to be laid.

Highways officials indicated that tenders for dismantling the old Kollidam bridge would be called soon. A portion of the bridge, which was in disuse after construction of a new bridge, collapsed in August 2018.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/r3vgtu/article32902897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY21-KARURHUGHWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tiruchi-karur-highway-stretch-widening-to-be-over-by-march/article32902898.ece

370,2020/10/20,CPI (M) cadre stage demo seeking dismissal of Surappa,"Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadre staged a demonstration in front of Anna University’s Regional Office here on Tuesday seeking the dismissal of Anna University Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa for ‘unilaterally’ acting and backing the Central Government’s move to bring the Anna University under its control in the guise of according ‘Institute of Eminence’ status.

The protestors also urged the Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit to immediately accord his consent for giving 7.50% reservation to rural government school students in medical admission.

The protestors, led by the party’s Tirunelveli district secretary K. G. Bhaskaran said the Vice-Chancellor of Anna University, who was hand-picked by the Governor ‘for his connections with right wing groups’, had been functioning in an ‘autocratic manner’ ever since he assumed office. When the Union Government decided to bring the Anna University under its control with the ulterior motive of denying reservations to students from the Backward Community, a proposal on offering ‘Institute of Eminence’ status to the University was sent for which the State Government had to ensure the allocation of ₹1,500 crore over a period of five years as its share.

However, without consulting the Tamil Nadu Government, Prof. Surappa had written to the Union Government saying that the Anna University itself had the ability to mobilise this fund to get the ‘Institute of Eminence’ status. Instead of seeking permission from the Tamil Nadu Government, which founded the Anna University, for allocation of funds for the development of the world-renowned institution, he was functioning in an “unilateral manner” for facilitating the Centre’s “ulterior motive” of bringing Anna University under its control in every aspect.

The protestors also alleged that the proposed division of Anna University would seriously affect its standards and deny reservation to students.

They also condemned the ‘attitude’ of Tamil Nadu Governor for indefinitely delaying his nod for the State Government’s decision to give 7.50% reservation to the rural students in medical admission.

An advocate P. Kamaraj, and his relative Sakthivel, both aged 45, were murdered by an armed gang in Kuppankulam village under the Nachiyarkoil police station limits in Thanjavur district on Monday night.

The gang, armed with sharp weapons, targeted Kamaraj and Sakthivel separately. Police said around 8.45 p.m., Kamaraj was returning home on a two-wheeler with his father Parthiban riding pillion, when the gang intercepted them near a school and hacked him to death on the spot, while sparing his aged father.

The gang members thereafter went to the house of Kamaraj apparently with the intent to murder his elder brother Kaviraj. However, Kaviraj managed to escape. The gang members chased his relative, Sakthivel and hacked him to death on a farm land nearby.

Police sources said the murders were suspected to have been committed due to previous enmity between Kamaraj and his close relative Rajavelu, also an advocate, over a land dispute. Rajavelu is a State-level office bearer of the Bahujan Samaj Party.

A Raul Jimenez shot that took a heavy deflection off the head of Leeds United midfielder Kalvin Phillips gave Wolverhampton Wanderers a 1-0 away win in the Premier League on Monday.

Leeds dominated possession in the opening half, firing crosses into the box at a variety of angles and threatening from set pieces without creating much in the way of clear-cut chances.

374,2020/10/20,IPL betting gangs make a killing from super overs on Sunday,"‘More than ₹50 lakh was placed on bets from the city alone’

The Indian Premier League (IPL) has been the bumper time any way for those betting money on cricket matches. But, the last Sunday was turned out to be a field day for the punters as both the IPL matches played between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and Mumbai Indians (MI) and Kings XI Punjab were decided in the super overs.

As per a conservative estimate, more than ₹50 lakh was placed on bets from the city alone. This year, the IPL series began behind schedule in the wake of coronavirus pandemic, and the matches are being played without audience in the UAE, as per the WHO protocol. Yet, this appears to have failed to demoralise punters, as betting is on the rise with every finishing game and the law enforcement agencies are not able to lay their hands on them.

According to sources, betting this IPL season is estimated to be more than that of the previous years. “But, it has become difficult to nail the betting organisers as the entire process being done online,” said a senior police officer. Unlike the previous years, betting gangs hailing from other cities appear to have not recruited franchises to set up their base in Visakhaaptnam. It is learnt that betting is being done in online mode from cellphones and that is why the police are unable to nail them, he explained. The police officers, especially those from the City Task Force (CTF), have been conducting raids and nabbing the members of betting franchise who ran their show from apartments in posh localities. But so far, no such cases have been reported this year.

“Things are a little different this time. Punters are directly indulging in betting with the bigger gangs in other cities online and it is being done individually. Bets are being placed online and payment is being done using various apps. A number of punters are also hooked through chat apps and indulging in groups betting,” said an officer who was earlier posted with the CTF.

Bars, where IPL matches are being screened, have become the dens for the betting organisers of late, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/egnlku/article32896415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20ONG4BETTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/ipl-betting-gangs-make-a-killing-from-super-overs-on-sunday/article32896416.ece

378,2020/10/20,"Verizon signs up Microsoft, Nokia to help clients build private 5G networks","Verizon is now keen on taking a share in new businesses that 5G might enable, either by partnering with bigger companies or by buying stakes in smaller ones.

Verizon said on Monday it has struck deals with Microsoft and Nokia to improve the telecoms giant's ability to target business customers by offering clients the ability to automate factory floors, lower costs and speed up data traffic through private 5G networks.

Private 5G networks remove the need for businesses to jostle for speed with others on a public network and help enable data-intensive applications that use computer vision, augmented reality and machine learning to increase productivity.

Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing business, will run on top of Verizon's 5G network to processes the data generated by machines at the local facility and use artificial intelligence to automate operations. Microsoft launched the new service late last month directed at telecom operators.

U.S.-based logistics company Ice Mobility is the first customer for the new partnership, allowing it to track employees packing the products into the right boxes to skip quality control.

“This is about creating a new business opportunity for everyone,” Verizon's Chief Strategy Officer Rima Qureshi said. She declined to disclose how the revenue would be shared between Verizon and Microsoft.

While 4G helped create multi-billion dollar businesses ranging from music and video streaming to cab hailing and food delivery, telecom operators seldom got a share of that growth.

Verizon is now keen on taking a share in new businesses that 5G might enable, either by partnering with bigger companies or by buying stakes in smaller ones such as virtual reality company 8i to Swiftmile, which makes charging systems for electric scooters.

In international markets, where Verizon doesn't have its own network, it is working with Nokia to build private networks for manufacturing and logistics companies.

“Next year will be all about deploying private 5G and not about commercial success and we will start seeing early monetization from 2022 onwards,” Sowmyanarayan Sampath, president of Verizon's global enterprise business, told Reuters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/verizon-signs-up-microsoft-nokia-to-help-clients-build-private-5g-networks/article32898948.ece
379,2020/10/20,Peruvian archaeologists unveil giant cat carved into Nazca hillside,"Johny Isla, the Culture Ministry's specialist for the Nazca-Pampa region, said it was estimated to be around 2,000 years old.

Peruvian archaeologists have uncovered a 120-foot-long cat etching in a little-explored area of the country's celebrated Nazca Lines UNESCO heritage site which is home to hundreds of gigantic geoglyphs dating back more than 2,000 years.

The figure, made up of a long body, striped tail and head with distinctive pointed ears, predates some of the area's better known-figures that include a hummingbird, spider and a human, the country's Culture Ministry said.

It is one of a number discovered in recent years by drone exploration of the protected 400-square-kilometer region that lies some 450 km south of the capital Lima between the towns of Nazca and Palpa.

Johny Isla, the ministry's specialist for the Nazca-Pampa region, said it was estimated to be around 2,000 years old and made up of groves carved into the mountain coupled with groupings of stones.

“The figure was in the process of disappearing because it was on a slope that was subject to quite extensive erosion which resulted in it being hidden for many years,” he told Reuters Television.

The geoglyph has been painstakingly cleaned and preserved by a team of archaeologists to make it more easily visible, the ministry said in a statement, adding that the discovery was “further evidence of the rich and varied cultural legacy” of the area.

The Nazca Lines, which can only be seen from the air, include etchings of a monkey, spider, pelican, whale, dog and lizard.

The geoglyphs created by the Nazca and Paracas cultures are striking reminders of Peru's rich pre-Columbian history and are considered archeological enigmas, as no one knows for sure why they were drawn, or so large and for so long.

The area has been closed to tourists since March because of the coronavirus pandemic but is due to reopen on November 10.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/2l1rem/article32898174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0008TE4UP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/peruvian-archaeologists-unveil-giant-cat-carved-into-nazca-hillside/article32898175.ece
380,2020/10/20,More than 80% of Europe's natural habitats in poor shape: report,"Habitats and species are facing numerous pressures, including intensive agriculture, urban sprawl, unsustainable forestry activities, and pollution, among others

More than 80% of the European Union's natural habitats are in poor or bad condition and more must be done to protect them, the European Environment Agency (EEA) warned in a report Monday.

The report, which covers the period 2013-2018, shows a deterioration from the 2007-2012 period when 77% of natural habitats were in “unfavourable” condition.

“We clearly need a large-scale restoration in Europe,” one of the authors of the report, EEA expert Carlos Romao, told reporters. “This is a must not only for biodiversity but also for the climate change agenda.”

Common farmland species such as the skylark, and habitats such as wet heaths, are declining across the continent. Habitats and species are facing numerous pressures, including intensive agriculture, urban sprawl — coupled with tourism and recreation — unsustainable forestry activities, and pollution, among others.

Climate change, with increasing drought and decreasing rainfall, also poses a challenge.

In the six-year study, the EAA registered over 67,000 types of human activities that harmed the environment in the 28 EU member states, including Britain.

Less than half of bird species in the EU, 47%, have a “good” conservation status, 5% points fewer than in the previous 2007-2012 reporting period.

Habitats important to pollinators are another area of concern, as they are crucial to the planet's biodiversity. Their conservation status has deteriorated more than others, the report showed.

But the conclusions are not all dire.

The number of animal species whose conservation status was “good” was 27 %, which, while low, was 4% points higher than in the previous study. And conservation efforts are paying off.

Natural habitats covered by the EU's Natura 2000 network are doing better than other habitats, the EEA said.

As a result, a number of species and habitats have improved, such as the agile frog in Sweden, coastal lagoons in France and the bearded vulture across the EU.

The areas protected by Natura 2000 covered 18% of EU land, unchanged from 2012, and 10% of marine areas, up by 4% points.

Danish environmental group Noah, a member of the “Friends of the Earth” umbrella organisation, said however that this was not enough. “At least 30% of land and 30% of marine areas in the EU should be protected by law, and environmental corridors should be made a part of a real trans-European nature network,” it said in a study in early October.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/wd3og4/article32898350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1278440211,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/more-than-80-of-europes-natural-habitats-in-poor-shape-report/article32898351.ece
381,2020/10/20,Kerala Bird Atlas project legwork is over,"How over 1,000 birders worked over a period of five years to put together the Kerala Bird Atlas, the largest project of its kind in Asia

The Kerala Bird Atlas, one of the largest citizen science projects in Asia, conducted jointly by the Kerala Agriculture University, Bird Count India and supported by the Kerala Forest Department, concluded last month.

This mammoth exercise, which took five years and enlisted over 1,000 birders, aims to document the birds of the State systematically and collect information about species distribution, abundance and seasonality across more than 30,000 square kilometres of forests, wetlands, urban and rural areas. According to project head PO Nameer from Kerala Agricultural University, the data generated will be analysed over the next six months, “and the findings may possibly debunk some long-standing notions”.

Co-coordinator Praveen J says that the birding community is excitedly awaiting the findings that will throw new light on all aspects of birding and birds in the State. “So far we were comfortable with certain ideas, for instance the house crow, jungle crow and babblers are found across the State; but the study proves otherwise. Such observations and information will be established once the data is studied,” he says.

Conducted over two seasons (dry from January to March and wet from July to September), the area was divided into 38,000 grids of one square kilometre each and converted to 4,000 cells. The entire State was broken up into blocks of 6.6x6.6 km each. Each was then divided into 3.3x3.3km cells. These were further partitioned into 1.1x1.1km sub-cells. From the last, one sub-cell was randomly selected for rigorous and scientific mapping of the bird distribution in the State.

What is unusual about the survey is that it enlisted citizen birders to help with the process. Around 1,000 volunteers and over 25 NGOs participated. “We were capacitating the participants, so it is a win-win situation for all. The individuals were excited to learn the ropes of birding and bird survey techniques. Beginners who joined us in 2015 had become expert birders by the end of it,” says Nameer.

Praveen says though they have been conducting surveys from 1990, they had not worked on this scale before. “We had to work within spatially distributed areas and within constraints of time.”

The project was first launched in 2015 at Alappuzha and Thrissur, the former being the smallest district with a thriving birding community. Once concluded successfully, in a year, it was rolled out across the State.

“The requirements to conduct a survey in forest and non-forest areas and rural and urban areas had different challenges,” explains Praveen, adding that, in areas like Idukki district that did not have a resident birding community, they had to rope in and train volunteers from outside. The districts of North Kerala and some remote areas of Kasaragod, Wayanad and Kannur also came with some challenges.

The Kerala Forest Department pitched in in areas such as Periyar Forest Reserve, Munnar Wildlife Division, Parambikulam Tiger Reserve etc where almost 80 birders participated, recalls Praveen. Birdwatchers from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra too were invited to participate in forest surveys.

Maxim Rodriguez, who headed the project in Kasaragod and was earlier part of the Kannur Bird Atlas in 2016, says it has been one of the most fascinating projects that he has worked in.

In 2017, he was put in charge of a pilot study and inducted volunteers via social media. Kasargod had been divided into 187 locations, and Maxim covered 80 sub-cells. “Each demarcated area had a one-hour survey,” he explains. “There were time protocols to be followed and a record of every species spotted in that given time was documented.” He points out that making notes on the ecology of the place was equally important, “like the presence of a water body or growth of invasive species of foliage...”

From a bird conservation point, says Nameer, they now have a baseline data of the birds of Kerala as of 2020. “The beauty is that this data is very structured and, if the process is repeated after five or 10 years, one will be able to compare the distribution of birds of Kerala. This information can be used for the long-term management of the habitat as well as the bird species.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/lxcyjc/article32897845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MPKERALABIRDS4,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/the-kerala-bird-atlas-is-getting-ready/article32897848.ece
382,2020/10/20,Podcaster is the new YouTuber,"Home-grown, DIY podcasters are increasing thanks to lockdown and free time at hand

The best spot to record his podcast, says Arabind Chandrasekhar, is his car. A couple of weeks ago, the Kochi entrepreneur was also recording from his kitchen, at midnight.

In Bengaluru, independent filmmaker Padmalatha Ravi, who lives near a busy traffic signal, has on occasion, resorted to recording her podcast by placing the mic inside a cupboard — “the acoustics are good,” she says.

Arabind and Padmalatha are part of a growing tribe of podcasters who started during lockdown.

Although Deepika Arun from Chennai has run Kadhai Osai, since April 2019, on which she reads Tamil works, she noticed an increase in listeners in March. By mid-March she started reading Sivagamiyin Sabatham by Kalki Krishnamurthy. “It is a 1,000-page book with 200 chapters; my reading concludes in early November. I read a chapter a day and we thought by the time I finish everything would be okay. The feedback from people is that listening to this was a relief during lockdown,” she says.

She started another podcast for children in April, Chittukuruvi, with her six-year old daughter. This was her way of expressing her love for the Tamil language while engaging children through stories, puzzles and tongue twisters.

Taking the plunge

“We see a hike of around 40% in content creation and consumption in the last six-seven months. Early on into lockdown, there was a spike in the domain which has stayed. Content is being created from tier 2 - tier 3 cities, and not only metros,” says Shubhangi Sahal, head of Content, Hubhopper Studio, a podcasting tool.

Noteworthy is the demand for regional content. “Hindi and ‘Hinglish’ are heavily consumed at the moment. There was a pattern — listeners would come for a TED Talk or an Oprah Winfrey show, but eventually gravitate towards Premchand ki Kahaniyan and other Indian content,” she says.

Arabind Chandrasekhar

Arabind’s Podcasts by Arabind Chandrasekhar is in his mother tongue — Malayalam. He tried YouTube first, but the number of people required to make a video discouraged him. “All you need here is a smartphone, a decent microphone, editing software to record, edit and upload. If I want to add songs like I did for my SPB tribute then I get help,” he says.

His three genres are — nostalgia, special days and conversations. “A Malayali’s interest is varied, much like teashop discussions. They span from politics to films and everything in between,” he says. He has been an avid consumer of podcasts, preferring the audio format to the video. Lockdown presented him the perfect opportunity to try the idea he had been toying with for a while.

Reneshia Mahesh

Voiceover artist Reneshia Mahesh from Kerala got curious about the medium after listening to actor Kalki Koechlin’s Kalki Presents: My Indian Life for BBC. “I developed an interest, but there was nothing of the sort in Malayalam then. My voice is my ‘career’, so when I found time on my hands, I bought a mic and started. This is perfect for those who don’t want to ‘show’ their faces,” she says. She launched Ennodoppam in Malayalam, in June.

Help is at hand for amateurs in the form of free apps that get a podcast ready and share it across platforms. . Most of these home-grown podcasters don’t have an idea of the exact figures, but they peg it between 1,000 to a few lakh ‘listens’.

Getting better

Choosing a genre helps; according to Shubhangi — motivational, spiritual/devotional, storytelling and personal finance are popular subjects. For example, development research and communication professional Nirupama V from Bengaluru and Archana Atmakuri, a research analyst in Singapore, run What’s Next? In Social Sciences. The feed, launched on July, is academic, targeted at non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) students to highlight opportunities social sciences offer. Into their fifth episode, they have planned a 15-episode package of content. Each episode is a two-week process, co-ordinated over Zoom calls and WhatsApp between the two friends from college.

Padmalatha Ravi

Padmalatha has uploaded seven episodes on her podcast (Curious Cat and Other Stories) since she started in August. She has not picked a genre. “Not having a genre is a bad idea according to those in the business. I have been told that if I want to get on ‘lists’ of podcasts to listen to, I need to find one,” she says, adding that she is veering toward mental health, art and feminism, where her work and interests intersect.

The enthusiastic feedback Arabind and Deepika have been getting proves that there is demand for content in regional languages. “A listener in Tanzania told me that my podcast makes them feel connected with Tamil,” says Deepika. Likewise Arabind, “I have had messages from Malayalis in the United Kingdom, for example, who told me that time — half an hour so — the couple spends listening to my podcast on their drive to work makes them feel connected to home.”

Can the hobby also be lucrative? Nirupama is upfront, “We are doing it for the content; we don’t want to make money.” However, Shubhangi says, “Advertisers are buying into the idea that podcasts are also a means of advertising like other mediums.” The figures could range from a few thousand rupees to lakhs, depending on the podcast and its reach.

When Deepika started podcasting, she had two digit figures of listeners per day, today she gets 2,500 listens per day. To be a successful podcaster consistency is the key. The percentage of abandoned podcasts is also considerable. This is a slow game, the audience is different and you have to build up your podcast. Shubhangi adds, “Creators get impatient that it [gaining ‘listens’] is taking long. There is no instant gratification here, it takes time.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/w00a6a/article32901565.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpdeepika,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/home-grown-diy-podcasters-are-increasing-thanks-to-lockdown-and-free-time-at-hand/article32901570.ece
383,2020/10/20,Dindigul hosts a party to part with your clothes,"Clothes swap parties are common in Europe and America. Last weekend, a college student organised it for the first time in Dindigul

Vipin V is your next door college boy, who also worries about the environment and carbon footprint. Last year, this student of biomedical engineering at PSNA College Dinigul, attended a lecture on global textile wastes and the staggering amount of clothing that ends up in landfills. The statistics haunted him.

During the lockdown, he researched on the subject and learnt that the fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions. “I looked at my wardrobe and felt guilty about my shopping pattern,” says the 20-year-old. As he began to de-clutter his cupboard, the idea to collect piles of not-so-old and worn out dresses from others flashed through his mind.

He requested for clothes as donation, which could be sanitised and swapped or upcycled into useful products for a clothes swap party. His parents (mother is a school teacher and father is a senior officer with LIC) supported his idea and the word was spread through personal calls and on social media. Vipin explains the three-fold concept: You give clothes that you no longer wear and take free clothes that other people don’t wear anymore, if they fit and suit you better; Someone else will breathe life into your old garments and have the freedom to experiment with it to their liking perhaps; No price tag attached.

Clothes call Visitors at the event; (Below) Vipin V, the organiser SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT

Actor Prithvi Raj and VJ/ TV anchor Priyanka Deshpande appeared in promotional videos that were circulated through various whatsApp groups and on social media urging people to make a responsible choice as Vipin formed a team of volunteers including his family members, house helps, friends and the neighbourhood tailor. Not only people from Dindigul, but many from Madurai, Theni, Sivakasi came forward with bags of their unwanted clothes. “We spent hours segregating them. Kids’ clothes and many churidars, saris and men's suits that the owners perhaps wore only once or never were dry-cleaned. All other old clothes were washed, cleaned, ironed and converted into fancier items such as jackets, shrugs, blouses, tops, long overcoats, head scarves, masks, different types of bags and wall hangings,” says Vipin.

Sustainable fashion

Vipin was initially sceptical about people wanting to take used clothes. “In India, the concept of recycling clothes is very different and not done from an environmental point of view. I was determined to introduce the idea to educate people and create awareness about sustainable fashion,” he says.

Last weekend he hosted the first-ever clothes swap party in his city with all safety measures in place, inside a school building on the Dindigul-Karur highway. The three day event spaced out the crowd and the venue helped to display the items keeping social distancing norms in mind.

Homemaker A Naeyah says she returned impressed with the unique shopping experience. The venue was decorated like a party. For an entry fee of ₹100 each, we got free snacks and a drink and enjoyed the fun activities such as calligraphy, photography, face painting, mehendi and tattoo. “We could pick up any dress of our choice free of cost,” she says.

School teacher Rizwana Riyas donated several of her old dresses and dupattas. And she was thrilled to see some of her shawls hanging as short coats. She picked up sling bags made from worn out jeans and old pyjamas. “Some of the upcycled clothings were priced between ₹20 and ₹150 and had many takers though payment was voluntary,” she says.

Well planned

Ananthy Pandiyar, an entrepreneur, went on two days and found the event well planned. Her first visit was out of curiosity. “I was not comfortable about picking up used stuff. But nothing looked second-hand. By the last day, majority of the clothes were gone,” she says, adding, the worn out fabric was neatly and creatively converted into attractive and useful items.""

Many school and college goers donated their modern tops, shirts and T-shirts which they describe as dubious and impulsive fashion purchases that tend to fill up the cupboards. ""I felt happy to see somebody else liking and picking it up. This is perhaps a better way to refresh and restyle your wardrobe,"" says Rishi, a high school student.

Vipin is happy that visitors found his event enjoyable and practical. “Many have already requested for the next one soon and to notify them going by the comments in the visitor's book,” he says, adding, “the swap party is a mindful way to deal with old clothes and to curate a minimal and inexpensive wardrobe for yourself. It helps to understand the benefits of slow fashion and how our wardrobes impact the environment.”

Vipin collected close to 1,000 pieces of clothings and upcycled 600 of them for the swap party. He plans to donate the left-over items and the money earned to orphanages and old age homes. “By swapping clothes, we can break the fast fashion chain and reduce the fashion footprint. It is like a shopping fix that doesn’t hurt the environment,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/wu3g3z/article32900638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Clothes-swap-party-a,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/common-in-the-west-a-clothes-swap-party-was-hosted-in-dindigul-for-the-first-time/article32900640.ece
384,2020/10/20,The Mootu lounger at Dutch Design Week,"How mridangam makers and Chennai’s Justine De Penning and Deepak Jawahar, of design firm The Architecture Story, collaborated for the ongoing Dutch Design Week

Eindhoven in the Netherlands is seeing a surge in visitors, albeit virtually. The 19th Dutch Design Week has kicked off and people are logging on to check out over 500 exhibits in 3D viewing rooms. Think light installations with discarded lenses, living coffins (with mycelium) and textiles woven by drones.

Also Read Highlights from Dutch Design Week

But it is an exhibit at the Dutch Invertuals Gallery’s True Matter show that we are interested in. Equal parts eye-catching and confusing, the Mootu Lounger by Chennai-based design firm, The Architecture Story, is shaped like a ‘U’ and strung with moulded leather pieces. Is it furniture or art? Can one sit on it? Turns out, designers and partners Justine De Penning and Deepak Jawahar welcome such questions. “We wanted to take design as an opportunity for divergent thinking,” says Jawahar, 35. “The point was to think of different ways that a body can interact with an object, and the lounger plays with perception and interaction.”

And, though you may not see it immediately, the conceptual design has its origin story in the mridangam, the main percussion instrument in a Carnatic music ensemble.

Justine De Penning and Deepak Jawahar of The Architecture Story

The intersection The Architecture Story’s ethos is one of immersive storytelling. “What we highlight with all our projects is a sense of experimentation and playfulness,” says De Penning, adding that they are working on a house in Tiruvannamalai, where the entire facade is done like a staircase. “It is almost like you are extending a traditional outdoor space like a thinnai all the way up the building. What that does is create a completely different social dynamic.” Their distinct backgrounds of architecture — Jawahar earlier worked at renowned architectural firm, UNStudio, and has exhibited at the Milan Design Week and India Design ID — and theatre add to this creative approach. “Both examine spatial relationships. In theatre, you look at how to break the fourth wall and make the audience a part of the play. That is what architecture does too. This is where the practices intersect,” says Jawahar.

Giving sound form

A few months ago, Invertuals had challenged 22 young designers from 17 countries to work with raw materials from their local context, and to play with techniques, craftsmanship and traditions. “We thought it would be interesting to explore music and design — not in a direct way, but through the tectonics [method of bringing things together] of music creation,” says De Penning, 33, while her husband Jawahar adds, “During our research, we found that [Indian physicist and Nobel Prize winner] CV Raman’s light scattering experiments were inspired by Indian percussion instruments. So we wondered, could it lend itself to design as well?”

While debating how to break away from regular modes of understanding form, the duo decided to look at the mridangam. Something that was representative of ‘place’, of Tamil Nadu. “We visited mridangam makers in Mylapore [an area synonymous with Carnatic music] and different parts of Chennai, and learned that the mootu [the moulded leather that covers the two mouths of the instrument] is used for three to four years and then discarded. So it is a generational craft that doesn’t have an afterlife,” explains Jawahar. They took home a number of mootus to experiment with — deconstructing it, immersing it in water, shaping it with another object. “For the final piece, we used the techniques and tectonics of the mridangam to create the story we wanted,” he says.

Making of the Mootu Lounger

Walking parallel worlds

This meant working with mridangam makers, hand-cutting 14x4 circular leather pieces, puncturing 48 holes around the circumference (the size of the circles and the number and position of the holes are derived from the mridangam mootu) and knotting them with leather ropes.

Public demands “We are both drawn to the idea of public space. We feel it is interesting and complex, and something that design can intervene on,” says De Penning, founder of co-working space The Grid in Adyar (with its mid-century and industrial design styles). Their earlier projects include the Chennai Photo Biennale and Magnetic Fields Festival. “Now, in the post-pandemic world, we are really fascinated with how both the work and domestic spaces will evolve. Offices will be seen less as production spaces and more as social accelerators — with a cross-breed of environments [such as cafes, etc],” adds Jawahar. And as the identity of offices dilutes, the emphasis on domesticity, he feels, will change radically. “In this new environment where you live and work, how do you rebalance? How to stop working will be the next thing. These are interesting changes coming our way.”

“When designing the framework, we did look at bringing in sound. The shape of the ‘U’, if filled with sound, allows for a certain movement,” De Penning tells me. But the desire to create a minimal translation had them deciding not to confuse the architectural framework with a sonic element.

The third piece of furniture from the three-year-old firm — the earlier two include a table made from marble, granite and metal, and a metal origami chair — the piece will not be mass produced, but they are open to commissions. As for the artisans, early suspicions about whether the duo was working on a new musical instrument have since turned into enthusiasm for more such experiments. “It was exhilarating,” Jawahar says. “Through August and September, in the mornings we would have these intellectual discussions on design with the gallerists and designers and [later in the day] go to Mylapore to collect the mootu and talk with the artisans. As designers, we were at the intersection of these two worlds. It pushed us to re-look TEK [traditional ecological knowledge] and the parallel worlds we are living in.”

385,2020/10/20,Coronavirus | Feluda test to be commercially available by month-end: CSIR Director General,"Once the viral RNA is extracted, it takes 45 minutes to an hour to confirm presence of the virus

The Feluda test, a coronavirus detection test developed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and to be commercialised by Tata Sons, will be commercially available in laboratories this month.

“It should be available anytime soon this month. All the formalities are completed,” Shekhar Mande, Director General, CSIR, told The Hindu.

The test, which still requires a nasal swab to be collected and sent to a lab, promises to be quicker than the gold-standard test because it doesn’t need the expensive RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction) machine that can set back a lab by at least ₹25 lakh.

A smaller, cheaper more portable machine called a thermocycler, which costs around ₹25,000, is employed and once the viral RNA is extracted, it takes anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour to confirm presence of the virus.

Also Read Explained: FELUDA paper strip test for coronavirus

FELUDA, that stands for FNCAS9 Editor-Limited Uniform Detection Assay, is also unlike antigen tests in that it uses a CRISPR-cas9 based system and therefore more accurate in detecting the virus.

CRISPR-cas9 is a genome-editing tool whose discovery won the Nobel Prize for chemistry this year. Though initially conceived to treat sickle-cell disease, in the FELUDA the cas9 enzyme, it can be used to hone in on a specific sequence of DNA (in this case unique to the coronavirus) and thereby infer its presence.

Compared to the RT-PCR test, it’s reportedly cheaper — about ₹500 per test compared to ₹1,200-₹1,600 for RT-PCR, according to current estimates though that would be known only once it’s commercially available in laboratories later this month.

A major factor that determines how quickly labs are able to process tests is in how quickly they are able to extract viral RNA. There are varying approaches and good labs with trained personnel can do the job within 15 minutes but can be a complex process in places with limited facilities.

While a paper-based test might resemble the home-based pregnancy test that doesn’t need an intervening lab, the FELUDA, isn’t yet at that stage and the paper is only one part of a series of steps to confirm the virus presence. The paper strip when dipped into a specially created chemical soup returns two blue lines if the virus is present and a single one if negative. “This bit on the paper takes two minutes but the several other steps can take time. However, the simpler machines and the standardised processes after the RNA is extracted make the FELUDA approach more scalable in a wide range of settings,” said Dr. Anurag Agrawal, Director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), whose scientists have developed the test.

In theory a saliva sample can be used in a FELUDA-style system but current government regulations don’t permit the use of such tests because there isn’t a standardised process to extract RNA and — the wisdom goes — can lead to many more false negatives. “Our future plans do involve being able to make it a purely home-based test but that’s still some time away,” Mr. Mande said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hfavjb/article32902756.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CORONA-TESTING-REP-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-feluda-test-to-be-commercially-available-by-month-end-csir-director-general/article32902741.ece
386,2020/10/20,How the Wheelchair Basketball Federation of India is working to help differently-abled athletes in COVID times,"The organisation has organised a host of online activities and training sessions for their members

This year has not been kind to sportspeople. With COVID-19 and the ensuing lockdown, teams had to bid sports facilities and group training, an abrupt adieu. Differently-abled athletes have got the short end of the stick, as physiotherapy sessions, water therapy and a host of other facilities were unavailable to them until Unlock 5. But, P Madhavi Latha, founder-president of the Wheelchair Basketball Federation of India (WBFI) is made of sterner stuff. Through the lockdown, she has organised a host of online activities and training sessions to lift both the spirits of the members, and their game.

Madhavi explains, “We conducted webinars on game rules by both Indian and foreign coaches, and a series on success stories by Paralympic gold medal winners, from across the globe. We arranged online sessions with physiotherapists, fitness and conditioning experts with simple tips on how to exercise with items found at home like bottles of water. Those recordings are available on our social media platforms and the players can watch them any time.”

Madhavi is also a national paralympic swim athlete, and has been longing to get some laps in. “In the absence of regular swimming, I started spending at least two hours practising yoga, including laughter yoga, pranayama, some other exercises, and meditation. But still it’s not equivalent to the effect of swimming.” Seeing the plight of wheelchair basketball players across the country, WBFI has helped soften the blow by reaching out to 300 of its members, with groceries and medical aid. “More than the equipment and essentials, we need financial support to engage the services of coaches and physiotherapists who are currently supporting the players on an honorary basis. We are also looking for support to arrange skill development sessions as many players are facing fiscal challenges due to loss of income during the pandemic,” Madhavi entreats.

To bring some sense of normalcy to an otherwise event-free year, WBFI has decided to conduct a competition as it does every year. This time it will be online, at the national and zonal level. ‘Virtually Unstoppable’ comprises four categories: quiz, art, skills and fitness challenges. Each State can send 20 participants. So far, there have been entries on Facebook, with movement, music, jewellery making, art. Likes and comments on social media will impact overall judgment in the category, to invite more public participation.

Fitness and skill challenges have more stringent criteria. International basketball referee, Anupam Sharma explains, “For the skills challenges, three or four judges will scrutinise the one-minute videos of the athletes dribbling, shooting, or displaying defence using the wheelchair. There is flexibility in whether the athletes use a sports wheelchair, a regular one or even a chair.” The fitness challenge entails doing wheelchair push ups, upper body workouts using TheraBands, 2 kilogram dumbbells or filled water bottles, and pranayama or surya namaskar in a wheelchair.

Hima Kalyani, who is currently working from her hometown in West Godavari, and practising her dribbling skills, says, “During the lockdown it was tough for us, as there was no court, but we have been in touch with each other via conference calls and that really lifts our morale and makes us feel like a team.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/mwviwz/article32898773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nisha-gupta,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/how-the-wheelchair-basketball-federation-of-india-is-working-to-help-differently-abled-athletes-in-covid-times/article32898774.ece
387,2020/10/20,UNICEF to stockpile half a billion syringes by year-end to prepare for COVID-19 vaccinations,"Besides syringes, UNICEF is also buying 5 million safety boxes so that used syringes and needles can be disposed of in a safe manner by personnel at health facilities, thus preventing the risk of needle stick injuries and blood borne diseases

UNICEF said it will stockpile 520 million syringes in its warehouses, as part of a larger plan of one billion hypodermic needles by 2021, to guarantee initial supply and help ensure that syringes are available in countries before the COVID-19 vaccines arrive.

As the world awaits a COVID-19 vaccine, UNICEF has begun laying the groundwork for the rapid, safe and efficient delivery of the eventual vaccine by purchasing and pre-positioning syringes and other necessary equipment, the UN agency said on Monday.

The agency said as soon as COVID-19 vaccines successfully emerge from trials and are licensed and recommended for use, the world will need as many syringes as doses of vaccine.

To begin preparations, this year, UNICEF will stockpile 520 million syringes in its warehouses, part of a larger plan of one billion syringes by 2021, to guarantee initial supply and help ensure that syringes arrive in countries before the COVID-19 vaccines, it said.

During 2021, assuming there are enough doses of COVID-19 vaccines, UNICEF anticipates delivering over one billion syringes to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts on top of the 620 million syringes that it will purchase for other vaccination programmes against other diseases such as measles, typhoid and more.

“Vaccinating the world against COVID-19 will be one of the largest mass undertakings in human history, and we will need to move as quickly as the vaccines can be produced,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said.

“In order to move fast later, we must move fast now. By the end of the year, we will already have over half a billion syringes pre-positioned where they can be deployed quickly and cost effectively. That’s enough syringes to wrap around the world one and a half times,” Ms Fore said.

Safety boxes

In line with the longstanding collaboration between the two partners, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will reimburse the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for the procurement of the syringes and safety boxes, which shall then be used for the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX Facility) and for other Gavi-funded immunisation programmes if necessary.

Besides syringes, UNICEF is also buying 5 million safety boxes so that used syringes and needles can be disposed of in a safe manner by personnel at health facilities, thus preventing the risk of needle stick injuries and blood borne diseases. Every safety box carries 100 syringes. Accordingly, UNICEF is bundling the syringes with safety boxes to ensure enough safety boxes are available to go along with the syringes.

UNICEF said injection equipment such as syringes and safety boxes have a shelf life of five years. Lead-times for such equipment are also long as these items are bulky and need to be transported by sea freight.

Vaccines, which are heat sensitive, are normally transported more quickly by air freight. In addition to saving time, early purchase of syringes and safety boxes also reduces pressure on the market and pre-empts potential early spikes in demand when vaccines do become available.

As the key procurement coordinator for Gavi, UNICEF is already the largest single vaccine buyer in the world, procuring more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries.

Every year, UNICEF provides vaccines for almost half of the world’s children and procures and supplies around 600-800 million syringes for regular immunisation programmes. COVID-19 vaccines will likely treble or quadruple that number, depending on the number of COVID-19 vaccines that are ultimately produced and secured by the UNICEF.

“Over two decades, Gavi has helped an additional 822 million children from the world’s most vulnerable countries access critical, life-saving vaccines,” CEO of Gavi Seth Berkley said. “This would not have been possible without our partnership with UNICEF, and it is this same collaboration that will be essential to Gavi’s work with the COVAX Facility.”

Cold chain equipment

To make sure that vaccines are transported and stored at the right temperature, the UNICEF, along with WHO, is also mapping out existing cold chain equipment and storage capacity — in the private as well as public sector — and preparing necessary guidance for countries to receive vaccines.

“We are doing everything we can to deliver these essential supplies efficiently, effectively and at the right temperature, as we already do so well all over the world,” Ms Fore said.

Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with support from Gavi and in partnership with WHO, UNICEF has been upgrading the existing cold chain equipment across health facilities in countries to ensure that vaccines remain safe and effective throughout their journey. Since 2017, over 40,000 cold-chain fridges, including solar fridges, have been installed across health facilities, mostly in Africa.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/ccf89e/article32898768.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SYRINGEKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/unicef-to-stockpile-half-a-billion-syringes-by-year-end-to-prepare-for-covid-19-vaccinations/article32898769.ece
