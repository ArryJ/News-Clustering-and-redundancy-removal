0,2020/10/25,"Three, including wife, held for man’s murder","The police have solved the murder of a tailor from Jigani, Mahesh, 34, who was bludgeoned to death on October 17, and arrested his wife, her lover, and a friend for the crime. The accused have have been identified as Prema, 28, her lover Shivamallu, 29, and his friend Mallesh, 26, all hailing from Denkanikottai, Tamil Nadu.

According to the police, Prema married Mahesh four years ago and the couple have two children. Mahesh ran a tailoring shop at Harogadde, Jigani, where the family resided. The family shifted to their native place, Denkanikottai, when the shop had to be closed for long spells during the lockdown.

While they were there, Prema allegedly fell in love with Shivamallu, a neighbour, and the relationship soon developed into an extramarital affair. “They allegedly decided to kill Mahesh, as he objected to their affair,” said the police.

According to the police, the affair continued even after the family returned to Harogadde. Shivamallu decided to hatch a plan to kill Mahesh and came to Bengaluru. “On October 17 evening, as Mahesh was returning home after closing the shop, Shivamallu with the help of his friend Mallesh allegedly bludgeoned him to death at a desolated spot and fled from the scene,” the Jigani police said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/three-including-wife-held-for-mans-murder/article32938648.ece
1,2020/10/25,Flooding: BBMP surveys affected households; puts count at 410,"Residents who have lost most of their belongings have sought enhanced compensation, arguing that relief announced by CM will not cover the loss

Early on Saturday morning, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) deployed around 200 pourakarmikas at Dattatreya Nagar in Hosakerehalli ward. Earthmovers were also pressed into service to clear silt from the roads. Around 300 households in Dattatreya Nagar, 60 in Kumaraswamy Layout, and around 50 at Dorekere, near Uttarahalli, were flooded after a spate of heavy rain on Friday.

BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said the civic body had conducted a ground-level survey to assess the number of households that were affected by the flooding.

Residents who have lost most of their belongings have sought more compensation, arguing that the ₹25,000 relief announced by the Chief Minister will not cover the loss.

Mr. Prasad said the civic body was also distributing food and drinking water to the affected residents. “We will provide meals to the residents on Sunday as well,” he said. However, several residents that The Hindu spoke to claimed that they had received no aid from the civic body, though a few organisations have stepped in to help with relief work.

Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Ltd. has also sent kits containing soaps, toothpaste, and toothbrush, and other essential toiletries. These kits were also distributed to the affected families in the flood-affected localities, Mr. Prasad said.

Flood alert in low-lying areas

The India Meteorological Department has forecast more rain in the city. Widespread light to moderate rain with isolated heavy rain associated with thunder activity over the BBMP area has been forecast for the next two days. The Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Cell (KSNDMC) has issued a flood forecast.

With antecedent moisture conditions given the rainfall over the past 24 hours, “major inundation” is likely in low-lying areas in Dasarahalli, West, and Rajarajeshwarinagar zones, said the forecast. Some of the areas likely to be affected are Rajagopalanagar, Shettihalli, and Chokkasandra in Dasarahalli zone; Dattatreya Temple, near Mantri Mall bridge, Nandini Layout, Laggere bridge, Shankar Mutt, Prakashnagar, Basaveshwaranagar, Sri Ramamandir, and J.P. Park in West zone; and Peenya industrial area 3rd phase, Rajarajeshwarinagar, Herohalli, Ullal, and Hemmigepura in Rajarajeshwarinagar zone.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/zai3f0/article32938628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGRAIN2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/flooding-bbmp-surveys-affected-households-puts-count-at-410/article32938629.ece
2,2020/10/25,‘We are down in the dumps as everything has been lost’,"Dattatreya Nagar residents take stock of the damage caused by heaving rain and flooding

Residents of 300-odd houses at Dattatreya Nagar are reeling from the damage wrought by floodwaters and sewage that entered their houses on Friday after hours of heavy rain.

“We have only the clothes on our back. When the raja kaluve overflowed and started flooding our ground floor house, we tried to salvage our children’s books and laptop first. All of us rushed to the terrace,” said Lakshmi N., a resident of Dattatreya Nagar.

The locality in Hosakerehalli ward was one of the worst-affected areas.“We were struggling for help. We made innumerable calls to the Department of Fire and Emergency Services, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, former councillor…none of them came to our rescue. Our relatives who live nearby actually swam to our house and rescued us,” she said, and added that her children were now at her mother’s house at Chikkalasandra, while she and her husband stayed back to clean their house and salvage their belongings.

Residents pointed out that this comes at a time when many of them have been making do with reduced incomes owing to job loss and salary cuts on account of the pandemic.

Residents have lost most of their belongings, including electrical appliances. V. Eshwar Prasad, who lives in the area, said an earthmover had been deployed by the civic body to clear the road of silt.

“There is no rain as of now, but we are anxious. Three months ago, several homes here were flooded. The BBMP then had promised corrective action, but nothing has been done so far,” he said.

Several provision shops and markets in the area have incurred huge losses. Sources said that the godown of Ramachandrapura Mutt, located behind the Dattatreya temple, where several bags of rice, oil packets, and other provisions were stored, was completely flooded. A factory that manufactured baby food, located next to the godown, was also flooded.

A resident who did not want to be named said the lack of elected representatives was felt deeply. “Earlier, we could contact the local councillor. Now, with no elected body in place, in time of need, there is no one we can really depend on,” the resident said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/q7jygw/article32938530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGRAIN5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/we-are-down-in-the-dumps-as-everything-has-been-lost/article32938534.ece
3,2020/10/25,"Tamil Nadu’s COVID-19 journey: 7,00,000 and counting","The seven-month journey has been fraught with challenges and some successes. What is clear is that there can be no let up in the future with regard to prevention, treatment and follow up activities, for what we have seen of the pandemic so far is merely the tip of the iceberg.

In a span of seven months, Tamil Nadu has gone from 124 to 7,06,136 cases of COVID-19. The journey into the pandemic has been dotted with ups and downs. But healthcare providers and policymakers know that it is nowhere near the end. Even though fresh COVID-19 infections are falling in the State, newer challenges are emerging.

Tamil Nadu’s prevention and control strategies that began in mid-January have drawn nearly as much appreciation as criticism. While the ramping up of its health infrastructure has paid off, the way the State had handled clusters and data drew a lot of flak. As the State moves ahead, the challenges are numerous — overworked healthcare providers/staff, increasing number of persons with suspected COVID-19 symptoms, high fatality rate among the elderly, post-COVID sequelae and poor adherence to masking, physical distancing and crowding in public places.

The State now has the fourth highest number of cases and accounts for 9.05% of the total COVID-19 cases reported in the country. It has the second highest number of deaths with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.55%. With a recovery rate of 93.36%, Tamil Nadu is among the majority of States that now have a recovery rate of more than 90%.

Though the number of cases reported daily in the State has come down in the past two weeks, Tamil Nadu is still among the top five to six States that are reporting more than 3,000 cases a day. Similarly, it continues to be among the top five States reporting more than 40 deaths a day.

Tamil Nadu has significantly ramped up its testing capacity since the outbreak began and remains one of the very few States to rely only on RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests and not on Rapid Antigen tests for diagnosis. More than 10% of the population has been tested so far. Owing to increased testing, the daily test positivity rate that peaked in July and August has now come down below the desired 5% mark.

“We are at a crossroads now,” Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said. “If we continue to follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and not let down our intensity in the fight against the infection, we will definitely see better times and further gradual reduction.”

‘Uncharted territory’

But he had a word of caution. “However, since the virus has the tendency to spread rapidly in newer areas, we are advised not to let down our guard and continue aggressive RT-PCR testing, conduct fever camps, apart from workplace interventions. We are in uncharted territory. Certain other countries that have seen a substantial dip in cases are seeing another surge. The challenge for us is to continue to keep a watch through fever surveillance, and simultaneously keep in mind the monsoon and early January-February period as the State is prone to other communicable diseases such as dengue and flu,” he added.

Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in early March, the State has been constantly equipping government hospitals at different levels. R. Narayana Babu, Director of Medical Education (DME), said, “Nearly 95% of patients were treated in government medical college hospitals, and we have improved all basic facilities from the start. From 232 oxygen-supported beds in March, we now have 36,729 beds in DME institutions. We have increased oxygen capacity from 223 KL to nearly 500 KL. Today, we have a total of 1.4 lakh beds earmarked for COVID-19 patients in the State”.

Another strategy that helped the State was the triaging of patients, according to T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. “Triaging was something that we planned as a strategy. Asymptomatic persons and those with mild symptoms were referred to COVID care centres or to home isolation. This turned out to be a good strategy as there was no unnecessary load on hospitals.”

Testing and good capacity of oxygen beds have in fact been the strengths of the State, helping to cope with COVID-19 better, Prabhdeep Kaur, Scientist-E and Deputy Director, Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Epidemiology, observed.

“Nevertheless, enforcement of masks and physical distancing needs to improve in places such as restaurants and market areas. One of the big challenges now is that people are not following any of the norms of masking and physical distancing. The risk perception is very low,” she added.

Next comes surveillance. “As we open up more and more, it becomes increasingly difficult to monitor. We need to expand surveillance to cover more places where clusters may emerge. The third big challenge is private sector regulations. CT scans are being misused as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19. It should be used for only patients with confirmed RT-PCR testing. Another matter of concern is the overuse of antibiotics. Even those in home isolation are prescribed steroids,” she said.

She stressed on the need for a long-term strategy balancing regular services and continuing COVID-19-related health interventions of testing, tracing and treatment.

‘Poor planning’

But Tamil Nadu, with excellent basic healthcare facilities, could have done better if the lockdown was planned better, DMK MLA and president of the party’s medical wing, Poongothai Aladi Aruna, said.

“The government’s planning was poor. We have lost over 10,500 lives. The government keeps saying that the numbers are low but we need to understand that at least 35% of them were in the productive age group of 20 to 60 years. We have lost a significant young population to COVID-19. Still, deaths due to complications post-COVID are not counted as COVID-19 deaths, and this way of calculating is wrong,” she pointed out.

T. Jacob John, retired professor of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, felt that the interventions were imposed before time. “Tamil Nadu’s caseload was zero in mid-Jan and miniscule in March. Interventions were imposed before time and when the time of need came, people were getting tired of restrictions. People have become very complacent and relaxed. They should be given regular pep talks about mask wearing, not to crowd, physical distancing and hand hygiene,” he said.

“On March 24, there was no epidemiological reason for lockdown. Such preventive lockdowns do not produce results. The State needed lockdown only in July-August, by which time the economy was in shambles. Under these circumstances, I must say Tamil Nadu has done reasonably well. The volume of case numbers are proportional to population size, which cannot be altered. What could be altered is the speed of spread and mortality. The State’s epidemic curve and testing volume parallel very much, indicating that testing kept up with demand or need for testing,” he further added.

Case fatality has been consistently about 1.6%, equal to that of Karnataka and marginally lower than the national average of 1.8-1.9%, Prof. John observed. “Tamil Nadu’s epidemic curve peaked 10-12 days after the national peak and that also indicates that the State did not lag behind for interventions. From early October, numbers are steadily declining in the State.”

In his view, the State can establish District Task Forces to manage the unlocking process under local conditions. “Every activity — manufacture, industry, wholesale marketing, festivals, temples, mosques, churches and schools — must have decentralised district plans of action until after the epidemic is over and/or the vaccine becomes available. Even vaccination can be decided by task forces, once a national policy is announced,” he said.

For healthcare providers in government hospitals, the challenges are different. A government doctor on COVID-19 duty, on condition of anonymity, said, “Now that we are 10 months into the pandemic, we are anticipating a spike in post-COVID sequelae. More patients are being diagnosed with new-onset diabetes, hypertension and lung sequelae after recovering from COVID-19. Most of them are in the younger age group, and this seems to be a new challenge ahead. Reinfection is also turning out to be common among healthcare workers. More than five staff nurses have had the infection for the second time recently”.

This was not all. There are more cases of swab negative with CT findings suggestive of COVID-19. In fact, of late, 40 to 50% of patients presented this way, and the situation in rural and semi-urban areas could be worse, he added.

Another area of concern remains the fatality among elders. Though the State has maintained the overall CFR fairly low at 1.55%, the CFR among the elderly (more than 60 years) population is high at 7.36%. While the overall CFR is beginning to show a marginal decline, the CFR among the elderly continues to increase. This is despite the overall number of elderly persons testing positive for COVID-19 coming down in the past three weeks.

Above all, a worrying trend is the sense of complacency among the public. “In Chennai, surveys have shown that 30% have immunity. So, 70% of the population is still susceptible, and this could flare-up any time. The virus is there, the host is there and we have less control now. So, we cannot be complacent and need to be prepared as many countries around the world are now facing a worse second peak than the first one,” Dr. Kaur added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9m6v86/article32938745.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-LT-FLOWER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tamil-nadus-covid-19-journey-700000-and-counting/article32938746.ece
4,2020/10/25,Octogenarian undergoes implant surgery 10 days after heart attack,"Doctors decided to operate to relieve her of pain from major fracture

An 87-year-old woman was recently operated upon for a fall at home, unusually, just as she was recovering from a heart attack.

Kamalabai, a resident of Thoraipakkam, was recovering from acute myocardial infarction for which she was treated at a private hospital earlier. Soon after she returned home, she had a fall, which broke her femur. Her family sought treatment at a private hospital at Nanganallur.

“The patient was recovering from myocardial infarction. Usually we don’t do surgery for at least three weeks after an attack of myocardial infarction. But in her case, as she had sustained a major fracture, she had severe pain, which could lead to another attack. We decided to operate to relieve her of her pain and to avoid further complications,” said V. Sivakumar, orthopaedic surgeon, Sivam Hospital.

The hypertensive octogenarian is also obese, the doctor said. Her heart was functioning at 30% of its capacity. But postponing the surgery would cause further complications, he added. The patient was given epidural anaesthesia and an implant was provided surgically five days ago. She is undergoing physiotherapy at the hospital. Post-surgery, her heart ejection fraction improved to 40% as she was able to move. She now walks with a walker.

“The unique factor is that the patient had not recovered from myocardial infarction. Only 10 days prior to the fracture, she had suffered a heart attack. Because of this, her heart ejection fraction is low. Without aggravating her heart condition, proximal femoral nailing was done under epidural anaesthesia [which is safer for the heart condition], instead of the general anaesthesia,” Dr. Sivakumar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/octogenarian-undergoes-implant-surgery-10-days-after-heart-attack/article32938732.ece

7,2020/10/25,Gang cheating people under pretext of doing exorcism busted,"Four held; search on for prime accused

The Washermenpet police busted a gang which cheated several persons under the pretext of performing special exorcism poojas. Four suspects, including two women, were arrested and a search is still on to nab the prime accused, a self-styled godman from Tiruvallur district.

The police identified those arrested as Amarnath, 24, of Kasimedu; Suresh, 34, of Arakkonam; Jayanthi, 29, of Kodungaiyur; and Pappa, 54, of Madurai.

A special team led by Julius Caesar, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Washermenpet, began investigations after the owner of a mini-truck from Tenkasi complained that a gang had cheated him to the tune of ₹2 lakh by saying they would exorcise him of an evil spirit. K. Rajakumaran, 45, of Meenatchipuram in Tenkasi district, recently met a man, who was pretending to be a godman, in his village. He said his family was in the grip of evil spirits and that he could ward them off for ₹2 lakh.

Mr. Rajakumaran sold his mini-truck for ₹5 lakh. He and his father-in-law arrived in Chennai with the promised amount. They were escorted by the self-styled godman and his associates in a car. The suspects took them near the Government Stanley Hospital, where they took the money and left claiming that they would buy the items for the ritual. But they never returned.

Mr. Rajakumaran lodged a complaint with the police. On scrutinising the call records of the suspects, the police identified the main suspect as Yuvaraj, 42, from Putlur, Tiruvallur. “He was in touch with another family in Velachery and intended to cheat them in a similar manner. Sensing trouble, he sent his associates to the house while he was waiting in a car. His associates were nabbed but Yuvaraj escaped,” a senior police officer said.

Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, the officer said, “The main suspect would deploy his associates to scout for potential victims in random villages. After his associates zero in on potential victims, the main suspect would offer help to solve their troubles by performing poojas. They seem to have cheated multiple people.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gang-cheating-people-under-pretext-of-doing-exorcism-busted/article32938695.ece

9,2020/10/25,Fruits market will be reopened soon,"It will move to Koyambedu in November

The fruits wholesale market is likely to be shifted back to the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex from Madhavaram in the first week of November.

This was decided at a meeting between representatives of the Federation of All Associations of Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex and officials of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority on Saturday. Since May, the fruits wholesale traders have been functioning out of a temporary market in Madhavaram.

D. Rajasekaran, the federation’s president, said, “The officials have assured us that the fruits wholesale market will be reopened in the first week of November. The announcement on reopening the fruits and vegetables semi-wholesale shops and flower market will be made in the first week of November.”

Semi-wholesalers recently held a protest, demanding that the government reopen the shops as they had been out of business for several months. Flower merchants also wanted the wholesale shops to be shifted to Koyambedu as the temporary market functioning out of Vanagaram had turned slushy due to rain. Several retailers found it difficult to walk through the muddy market to make festival purchases on Saturday.

T. Sivakumar, a wholesale marigold merchant, said, “The market had double the usual number of visitors on Saturday, and it became congested in the morning.”

Flowers sold for double the rate in the wholesale market due to demand and fewer arrivals following heavy rain. Marigold and roses were sold for ₹200-₹250 a kg. A. Manohar, a flower wholesaler, said the merchants were now spread across various areas, including Maduravoyal and Badrian Street and Parrys’ Corner. Jasmine was the costliest and sold for ₹1,000 a kg.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4vqz71/article32938687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24OCTTHMARKET-WOES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fruits-market-will-be-reopened-soon/article32938688.ece
10,2020/10/25,Safety guidelines go for a toss as crowds throng T. Nagar,"Despite fines and warnings, festival shoppers as well as store owners remain lax

Despite several warnings, the public as well as business houses continue to ignore norms, including wearing masks and maintaining physical distance at T. Nagar, the main shopping hub in the city.

While big shops in the locality are now strictly keeping a tab on visiting customers by checking temperature and advising them not to take off their masks, the smaller ones are yet to get their act together.

“After a popular textile chain was sealed, many shops have become alert and are strict about the number of people who are allowed in,” a textile shop owner in Pondy Bazaar said.

“But with the festival season around the corner, it is highly impossible to restrict the crowds. We have received instructions from the police to restrict the number of people on each floor — if we do that we will end up losing business as well as regular clients,” he said. Several retailers echoed the opinion.

Another retailer on Usman Road pointed out that the Greater Chennai Corporation said those who violated safety norms would be fined, but monitoring was lax and people had become lethargic. “The Corporation teams need to be more vigilant at least during the festival season. They should deploy volunteers. Only then will the public follow rules,” he noted.

Shop owners here said the crowds would increase once suburban trains resumed operations.

Many without masks

On Saturday, many people who came to shop in the afternoon never maintained physical distancing; many were standing outside shops without wearing masks. Arunachalam, a shopper, said, “With no air conditioning in many buildings, it is suffocating to wear a mask all the time.”

On Saturday evening, Additional Commissioner of Police, South, R. Dhinakaran, accompanied by Joint Commissioner of Police A.G. Babu and Deputy Commissioner of Police, T. Nagar, D.N. Hari Kiran Prasad, went around the busy shopping spots in T. Nagar and reviewed arrangements to ensure that all COVID-19 safety norms were being adhered to.

Mr. Dhinakaran said shopkeepers had been asked to follow the norms that were suggested to them. “We have asked them to permit customers in a phased manner. Only 50 customers will be allowed at a time on a floor. They can issue tokens to avoid crowding. The shop owners have agreed to our suggestions,” he said.

Barricades have been placed on Ranganathan Street, and shopkeepers have been asked not to display signboards or put up stalls on the street to avoid congestion and the allow free movement of shoppers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/c810mz/article32938683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24OCTTHTNAGAR-RUSH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/safety-guidelines-go-for-a-toss-as-crowds-throng-t-nagar/article32938684.ece
11,2020/10/25,Never be a wet blanket,"Share in the joy of others on the spur rather than put off the jubilation

I have come to understand, quite late, that how we become killjoys or hijackers or thieves of joy. So, I noticed a killjoy style in me when my son came rushing to me with some good news, and I barely paid attention to him. I hardly looked up from the newspaper, rather I felt distracted.

He felt hurt and looked down. I tried to figure out what pushed me into being that? Maybe, I was tired at that time, feeling bored, engaged in something else. I could have told him to come back later.

But imagine, particularly me as a parent, when I am back home after a tiring day. Maybe thinking about what has been happening at work, and my son comes bounding up to me and says, ""Dad, an amazing thing happened. I want to tell you about it."" And I, in that moment, retort, ""You know what? Just give 15 minutes, let me get out of my work clothes.""

The problem is that no one would come back later. And even if I sought the child out, ""Tell me now, Dad wants to know, what were you so excited about?"" Guess what? The joy that he’s sharing 15 minutes later isn’t the same that he wanted to share. So, we are a killjoy sometimes because we believe we will do it later. It doesn’t work like that. Working towards a joyful me, therefore, I have decided to give the people I love more of what they want the moment they want it.

Sometimes I notice people picking up on another’s conversation, and changing it to something else like a joy hijacker. For example, some exciting news comes to me — say, friends are thinking about taking a long road trip to Shimla. I change the conversation to my upcoming cricket match. And one could see the other getting upset and confused about why I changed the conversation. Someone comes to me with good news and before I know it, instead of shining the light on that other person, I begin shining the light on myself. Why do we do that? Maybe we feel envious. So, to become a joyful me, I am working towards giving up the habit of envying or competing with people to show oneupmanship.

Sometimes we respond describing the problems involved with the good news. In the case above, I say that is good news, but the trip will consume a lot of time. I am worried because my time is committed elsewhere, and I don’t know where I am going to have all that time. All right, that style is called joy thief. What I did is that I pointed out all the problems to the good news. My focus was negative. And my negativity drained the other’s joy. I didn’t mirror the excitement. Well, the person went from joy to worried. The person wasn’t feeling any closer to me, and was worried about what previously made him or her so excited. I realised being high on critical thinking or judgment makes me a joy thief. So, I am trying to overcome the factors or notions that make me a joy thief, as it creates heart burning, distrust, and starts splitting the connection that person has with me.

I realised that I must respond to good news joyfully and actively, like the above road trip news, saying, hey, who made this amazing trip? How did this idea come to you? I am so excited about it. Psychologist Shelly Gable calls this as the active constructive style that strengthens relationships and makes you a joy multiplier in conversations. You make good eye contact, you smile, you mirror the excitement. It would be a shared joy. So, I try to unmute my positive emotions and lend myself to the person interacting with me. That’s what joyful me is all about, and which will build my relationships.

12,2020/10/25,Dasara in Pakistan,"Effigies of Ravan and Kumbhakarn are made by Muslim artisans for the festival

""It’s only through travelling and visiting different places and countries can one dispel a host of prejudices against the people, cultures, faiths and ethos of the visited lands and countries,"" Trevor Fishlock said.

This statement assumes greater significance when in these religiously polarised times, even an innocuous commercial caused so much fuss. In 2017, I was in Pakistan during Dasara. Though I have been visiting Pakistan for many years, it was my maiden experience to be there during that time. A journalist friend of mine took me to Shri Swami Narayan Mandir on M.A. Jinnah Road in Karachi. I was amazed to see Hindu devotees happily setting the effigies of Ravan, Kumbhakarn and Meghnad ablaze.

I never expected this to happen so openly in a perceived Islamic country like Pakistan. Curious, I asked my friend, ""Who makes these effigies here?""' ""Muslim artisans,"" she told me. ""Come next year a fortnight before Dasara, I’ll take you to the artisans.""

So, in 2018, I visited Karachi during the time. My friend took me to those artisans who made the colourful effigies and stuffed them with small crackers. All those artisans were bare-footed in deference to the sentiments. Most of those Muslim artisans had roots in Ghazipur, Deoria, Basti and Gonda of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Their ancestors migrated to Pakistan during Partition. They carried those shared religio-cultural ethos to Pakistan, respectfully retained and bequeathed them to their next generation. Those artisans further told me that they had relatives in U.P. and Delhi and they too made effigies of Ravana and Meghnad.

The effigies will again be burnt this year made by the same Muslim folks. Isn’t it time to make a bonfire of rancour and recrimination along with the effigies? Shouldn’t that be truly symbolical in these prejudiced times?

13,2020/10/25,Conversations in the time of corona,"We are in the middle of a crisis that is too good to be wasted

Growing up in an urban jungle, one of the things we as children would look forward to was power cuts in the late summer evenings. While we would rush out of our homes to play hide-and-seek under the moonlit sky, the adults were rather crestfallen at missing their daily dose of television and were forced out of their burrows to make conversation with their forgotten neighbours. Thanks to these power outages, conversations which had sadly been sacrificed at the altar of television and technology would ephemerally come to life.

Today, while the world is in the throes of an unprecedented crisis, it has also experienced a power outage of sorts and we have come to reassess everything we took for granted. In this sobering spirit of introspection and ironically in the times of social distancing, I would like to make a case for meaningful conversations coming back to life.

When the lockdown was imposed in March, I was confined to my room in a tiny hamlet in southern Germany. The lockdown pushed me deeper into the burrow I had been building myself and I started binge-watching YouTube videos, mostly interviews of miscellaneous people who had ""made it"" in their fields. It was in this miasma of copious online content consumption and social distancing that I realised I could learn a whole lot more by conversing with my peers than by listening to celebrities I had never met. With this realisation, I stumbled upon the idea of interviewing my peers from university, who were also stranded. The result was Petrichor, a daily podcast in which I would talk to a different person every day about their passions in life, their journey, their greatest learnings, their fondest memories from university and every other topic under the sun, except corona.

A new episode of the podcast was posted on the university WhatsApp group every evening at 7 p.m. and all of us got to relive a person’s story. Each episode gave us a whole new perspective on a friend we thought we knew very well. We were moved by their struggles, inspired by their achievements and stimulated by their thoughts. While we tended to place celebrities on a pedestal, we saw our peers as equals and it was easier to be inspired than to be intimidated. It also gave everyone a platform to express themselves and provide reassurance that we were all in the trenches together. As the days rolled on, we looked forward to listening to a new story every day and learning more about a person who was on the same journey as ours.

The podcast went on for 35 consecutive days and the conversations never ceased to be fascinating. After this experience, I truly felt like the adult who had been forced out of his bubble to make conversation with the members of the community that had shaped him. We are in the middle of a crisis that is too good to be wasted. While despair and disillusionment are on the rise, there is always a silver lining, be it a pandemic that grips the world or a trivial power outage. With a bit of effort, we can add bringing back meaningful conversations to the uplifting list of plummeting emission levels, cities waking up to the songs of forgotten birds, crystal clear water in streams and everything else that the pandemic has changed for the better.

The podcast was named Petrichor, to remind all of us, Indian students stranded away from home, the sweet scent of the soil soaked in rain. It’s a scent that holds a lot of memories. The podcast could serve as an example of how you could foster meaningful conversations in your own groups and communities at a time when all of us need to come together to get through a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. It is time for us to come out and play under the moonlit sky, like we did all those years ago, except that we will be playing with thoughts and ideas, and we will have to continue playing even after the light turns back on.

14,2020/10/25,The power of post,"It still acts as the messenger when even technology fails to establish connections

My mother is 89 and growing more frail by the day. She lives in one city, and I in another in a different State. Our contact was largely through letters. Even if mine were rambling ones on plain sheets of paper, she would read them over and over. Occasionally, she would reply in an inland. Her handwriting was not so great, but each letter made me feel her presence. Then came the blessed telephone. We stopped writing letters to each other. She didn’t like using the small mobile handset to make or receive calls, not even from me.

Since the start of the year, I noticed that I was calling her more often than she did. Only a few minutes into our increasingly one-sided conversation, she would seem to be in a hurry to disconnect.

Nothing that my brother told her would induce her to walk up to the telephone. Through a video call on a mobile, I could ‘see’ her but she could not hear me. Her speech was slow and slurred; so she preferred not to talk at all. I had never felt so helpless. After a health scare a year ago, I was in the vulnerable category. Forget about my family permitting me to travel, the first thing my mother would say was, ""Why did you come? You shouldn’t have taken the risk.""

Time and COVID-19 created a huge chasm between us that was growing by the day.

It was in this state of despair that I decided to write a letter to her. I rummaged and came across a few inlands. They were bought several years ago and no longer looked fresh. The stamp printed on it was ₹2.50. Could the rate have gone up? The India Post website reassured that it still cost the same. I wrote in big bold letters and dropped it off with a prayer that the postman should collect it and that it reaches my mother without gathering any virus along the way. Exactly five days later, on October 10, my sister-in-law telephoned to say that my letter did indeed reach its rightful destination, that my mother read it loudly and slowly and that her smile lingered for a long while.

Coincidently, October 10 happened to be National Postal Day. My sincere salute to our dedicated postal staff. Thanks to them, I am at least able to write to my mother even if she is unable to send a reply.

15,2020/10/25,"Probing questions, prying eyes","Starting life anew in a place where everyone knows everything about everyone else

“Sir, I notice that you have recently shifted into this area. What do you do,” asked the autorickshaw driver as he was turning into the lane leading to my apartments.

I had slowly started getting used to such “searching” questions ever since relocating to Kerala from Delhi. While it was quite unimaginable for any auto driver in Delhi to be asking such questions, it was more a rule than an exception in my new place for everyone to know everything about everyone else.

Having by now realised that such Q&A sessions were the norm in these parts, invoking my best behaviour, I replied, “Yes, I have only recently shifted. I have retired and am not doing anything.”

I thought this reply would end the ongoing “probe”. But I was wrong. The driver was one who was imbued not just with well-meaning curiosity but also a desire to reach out and help senior citizens find the ways and means to spend their evenings. He chuckled in delight at having found the perfect solution for me. “Sir, you might have seen a group of senior citizens sitting on the bench below the lamppost in the corner. They will be very happy to have you join them,” he said.

Finding that I was not particularly excited at this well-intentioned proposal of his, he added for good measure: “Sir, all those people have retired from senior positions and are well off.”

Huddled in dim light

I would often see this venerable group huddled on the bench under the dim lights from an adjacent lamp post. What I didn’t quite fancy was the positioning of the bench, placed right at the edge of the turning leading to my apartment. I would often notice that the group’s attention would turn to anyone going or coming out of the apartment.

Four or five pairs of eyes, even if from venerable senior citizens, were not exactly something that a person like me, coming from Delhi, where attention had to be earned, was used to. I would find the assemblage seated even till as late as 8 p.m. The dimness of the light above the bench only added to the general murkiness of the group.

A couple of times when walking past the group during late evening, I would almost sense that it was only a matter of time, or at best, a walk or two past them again, that someone from the group will want to “know” a little more about me. But recently, I came to know that following some “privacy” concerns and complaints, the group has now relocated itself to another bench, more private even if less strategic!

I can now walk past the lane without the feeling of being “X-rayed” by several pairs of “over-observant” eyes.

16,2020/10/25,Hits and misses of OTT,"Is it content sans social obligations?

Recently, I joined the OTT (over-the-top) bandwagon with my first streaming device. Never did I think I would have to navigate through a multitude of choices and make tens of decisions to finally enjoy an hour of undisrupted entertainment.

New concepts have emerged on how we define, enjoy, or watch content. The on-demand model based on choice and convenience implies we have better control over when, where and what we decide to see.

And while I appreciate so many choices in, and control on, content, language, pace and so on, it has increasingly become a laborious process. Instead of audience, we have become consumers. Our entertainment choices are now based on concrete notions of productivity and utility, instead of abstractions such as togetherness and collective enjoyment. Convenience and portability offered by OTT platforms have removed the act of watching from its social context and made it a solo, individualistic activity. Instead of appreciating the narrative, we absorb content as a never-ending trail of commodities.

However, there is one area where credit is due. OTT platforms have democratised content. It shows stories that are unconventional and sometimes, not very palatable for TV or theatre audience. But while they might be free from pre-censorship, commercial motivations have led to proliferation of content without offering any radical choice. What is disconcerting is that the increasing use of violence and expletives is often conflated with “richness”, “novelty” and “modernity”.

Until now, OTT has acted as technologically empowered marvels in a marketplace independent of social worries. But their potential to create a long-lasting impact on the minds of audiences leads to a question: will “de-socialised” entertainment be able to realise it has obligations to society?

17,2020/10/25,Corona and cutpurses,"Their art is at its nadir, with no one to write a paean

COVID-19 saw the beginning of a new fashion segment — a designer piece of cloth, cut and stitched, worn on the face, the mask. While one business opened up, another age-old business dependent on a not-so-fashionable piece of cloth — the pocket — is at its nadir.

Videoconferencing and streaming apps may have made a fortune during the lockdown, but most businesses and professions have suffered a body blow. But this one is different. Really different. We are talking of the “pickpocketing” business, which depended critically on individual skill, with one single failure sealing the fate.

During pre-COVID times, as we checked into a hotel in Barcelona, the first thing the smiling receptionist said was, “Sir, pickpocketing in Barcelona is not considered a crime; it’s an art. Be careful with your wallet. These people here are very fine in their work.”

The legacy, the dexterity, the artistry made “pickpocketing” a unique profession worldwide. Plastic money and ATMs sounded its death knell, but COVID-19 was like carpet-bombing, flattening the centuries-old profession to dusty non-existence.

Contrary to what most people think, in the right place and time, pickpocketing is a safe and profitable profession — as profitable perhaps as intermittently successful armed bank robbery, but with little chance of arrest or a prolonged prison sentence.

Mind-boggling techniques

The techniques employed by a cutpurse are varied and mind-boggling. Since the pocket is close to the body, any intrusion is likely to be felt by the target. So the need for finesse is essential, but not enough. A diversionary contact at some other part of the body is needed to distract. It’s also the fine art of hitting someone in a crowd, outwardly accidental and profusely apologising, while another relieves the target of his wallet.

“Attention diversion” has gone to hi-tech levels in this profession. It seems pickpockets themselves put up “beware of pickpockets” signage in buses and public places; as you read it, you are likely to touch and feel the spot where the wallet is, saving them time and effort on “target localisation”.

But things have changed over time as wallets contain less and less of cash and only plastic. Credit cards are part of the booty, but using them in an ATM involved much more organised team work and higher levels of criminal fraud, which many artists didn’t want to dive into.

With the lockdown and strict physical distancing and the stoppage of public transport, the business is gasping for breath. And the art is at its nadir, with no one to write a paean.

18,2020/10/25,Consumer Capers,"The Centre is issuing cash vouchers to its staff to buy white goods; an earlier generation of civil servants had no such luck

The Finance Minister recently announced cash vouchers in lieu of LTC, apart from festival advance, to government staff to encourage them to buy white goods and spur festive demand. No such luck when I was in service, at least during my early career. But then there was no pandemic either.

I didn’t possess anything worthwhile, except a boxful of books, when I landed for training in a district of what is now the State of Telangana. The first of the white goods I owned came as a gift from my sister abroad in the shape of a cute little transistor radio. The timing was perfect. It arrived just a few days before the landing of man on the moon on July 16, 1969. I was all “tuned up” to listen to the radio commentary on that momentous event, but the blessed beauty refused to catch any of the waves. Perforce, I cut my nose to spite my face and went and bought a large transistor radio at the cost of my one month’s salary.

I am painfully aware that my white goods gallery, even after four years of employment, compared very poorly with the current generation’s head over heels pursuit of everything — TV, fridge, washing machine, AC and car — as soon as they get their first pay packet.

Modest beginnings

I got married and got a table fan as a gift, which proved to be very useful. Then came a second-hand car, bought with a government loan, of course; a 1956 model Standard Super 10, at a cost of ₹7,000. My next acquisition was a locally made refrigerator acquired with the sudden cash flowing from the first royalty on a book I had written when I was teaching seven years before and forgotten after having not heard from the publisher.

It was followed by a used tape recorder from my wife’s sister who, along with her husband, landed up in the backwaters of another Telangana district after having done a long stint in an Indian embassy. Next came a gift from my brother, who had gone to France for a short assignment sometime in the early 1970s. It came in the shape of a very useful electrical hand mixer.

Upon reaching Delhi in the mid-1975, caught in the fast pace of life, we acquired a second-hand mixie for ₹75 from an acquaintance who was on a selling spree as he was going on a posting abroad. Having stayed for a fairly long time in a southern region where, in those days, the summer was not very hot, we had forgotten the rigours of northern summers. One day towards the end of May 1976, I, along with a south Indian friend, on an impulse, went to Daryaganj and bought air coolers, much to the delight of our family members.

Then I was selected for a short stint of training in the U.K. The Super 10 car had been giving trouble then. I sold it for a princely sum of ₹2,500, added another ₹1,500 from my savings and bought a black-and-white TV for the entertainment of my family members who could not accompany me. I returned with a mixer and a cassette player and, with still some savings in hand, we bought a washing machine which didn’t quite wash. It only made an attempt to clean the clothes; rinsing and drying had to be done manually.

As we have aged, one of the hot topics of heated discussion has been disposal of old white goods accumulated over the years. After disposing of a dysfunctional mobile phone and a three-in-one, now we are stuck with a DVD player acquired almost 10 years ago but not used even once.

But retained, and still vigorously used, is the electric hand mixer gifted by my brother in the early 1970s, a tribute to French technology.

19,2020/10/25,MVA allies to contest BMC polls together: Sanjay Raut,"The Shiv Sena-ruled BMC is the country’s richest civic body with an annual budget of over ₹33,400 crore

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners, including the Sena, NCP and Congress, will contest the 2022 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation polls together.

The ruling MVA in Maharashtra is here to stay, the Shiv Sena’s Chief Spokesperson told a news channel, and expressed confidence that it would win the civic polls in the country’s commercial capital.

The Shiv Sena-ruled BMC is the country’s richest civic body with an annual budget of over ₹33,400 crore.

“The Shiv Sena-led MVA will fight the civic polls in Maharashtra’s capital and will win it. In Mumbai, who else but Shiv Sena can win? The MVA is here to stay permanently,” Mr. Raut said.

The Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress last year forged an alliance to form government after the Uddhav Thackeray-led party parted ways with long-term ally BJP over the issue of sharing the Chief Ministerial post.

20,2020/10/25,Hindutva is essence of country’s selfhood: Mohan Bhagwat,"The RSS chief said the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was not against any religious community amd that opportunists unleashed organised violence in the name of protests.

Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s concept of Hindu rashtra is not political or power centered, said RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in his annual address on the occasion of Dussehra at the organisation’s headquarters in Nagpur.

“When Sangh says Hindusthan is Hindu Rashtra, it does not have any political or power-centered concept in its mind. Hindutva is the essence of this Rashtra’s ‘swa’(selfhood). We are plainly acknowledging the selfhood of the country as Hindu,” said Mr. Bhagwat. He added that the Hindu culture has expressed itself in diverse forms, “But, some groups are trying to spread hatred in society by creating insecurity among them, stating that diversity will be finished if they identify themselves as Hindu,” he said.

Mr. Bhagwat claimed that the word Hindutva was applicable to the 1.3 billion people of India as the word expressed identity, continuity of spirituality-based traditions and the entire wealth of value system in the land of Bharat.

Lashing out at the opposition, the RSS chief said, “Healthy political competition is always welcome, but competition that morphs into hatred, bitterness and animosity thereby weakening the social fabric is unwarranted. Those misaligned with or opposed to our socio-cultural values, have, while professing to be the champions of democracy and secularism, continued to fool and confuse people.”

“The ‘swa’ or ‘self’ in ‘swadeshi’ refers to the same Hindutva. That spirit or ‘swa’ should be the compass directing our intellectual brainstorming and plans of action,” he said.

Commenting on anti-CAA protests, Mr. Bhagwat said that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act does not oppose any particular religious community. “But those who wanted to oppose this new law misled our Muslim brothers by propagating a false notion that it was aimed at restricting the Muslim population,” he said. The RSS chief claimed that using CAA, opportunists unleashed organised violence in the name of protests. “Even before something could be thought out, corona crept in. In the background, the efforts by rioters and opportunists to reignite the conflict still continue,” he said.

Commenting on the ongoing stand-off with China, Mr. Bhagwat said that Indian defence forces, government and the people remained unfazed and responded sharply to China’s efforts of invading our territories. “Rising above China economically and strategically and securing cooperative ties with our neighbours are the only way to neutralise the expansionist aspirations of China. Our present policies seem to be charting those very horizons,” he said, in an apparent approval of the Centre’s dealing with the China issue.

He added that mistaking India’s benevolence for weakness and attemptimg to disintegrate or weaken it by sheer brute force is unacceptable. “The message sent by our leaders with a sense of self-respect and the indomitable ethical-patience of our citizens must compel China to reform its attitude. But if push comes to shove, we will not fall short of alertness, firmness and readiness,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/g17uit/article32940675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHAGWAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hindutva-is-essence-of-countrys-selfhood-mohan-bhagwat/article32939866.ece
21,2020/10/25,Blaze at Mumbai mall doused after 56 hours,"It was probably one of the longest fire-fighting operations in the city in recent times.

Nearly 56 hours after a fire broke out at the City Centre Mall in Mumbai, it was doused by fire personnel early Sunday morning, an official said.

This is probably one of the longest fire-fighting operations in the city in recent times.

Earlier this month, a blaze at a cutlery market in south Mumbai took almost 45 hours to be extinguished.

The fire at the City Centre Mall in Mumbai Central area broke out on the second floor of the basement-plus-three- storey structure at 8.50 pm on Thursday.

“It was a level-5 (massive) blaze and was doused around 5 am on Sunday,” a fire brigade official said.

Around 14 fire engines and 17 jumbo tankers were engaged in the operation, he said, adding that cooling operations are underway.

Five fire brigade personnel, including a deputy fire officer, received injuries during the fire-fighting operation, but all of them are stable and discharged from hospitals, the official said.

The fire was initially categorised as level 1 (minor), but was upgraded to level-5 after flames spread to other parts of the building, he said.

Over 3,500 people from an adjacent residential high- rise were evacuated as a precautionary measure, he said.

He breathed his last late on Friday night. He was 77.

Patil was earlier receiving treatment at a hospital in Mumbai, but was shifted to Nashik some days ago. On Friday, he was admitted to the private hospital in Nashik to get treatment for a kidney ailment, they said.

Patil, a close associate of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, had worked as the Industries, Cultural Affairs, Youth and Sports minister in the State.

He was known for his contribution in the fields of agriculture and forestry, and for Jatropha cultivation across the nation.

Renowned Marathi litterateur late V V Shirwadkar, popularly known as ‘Kusumagraj’, had given him the title of ‘Vanadhipati’.

Patil is survived by two daughters, sons-in-law and grandchildren.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray expressed his grief over the demise of Patil.

In a tweet, the Chief Minister’s Office said that Patil, who once held the position of sarpanch, went on to become a minister in Maharashtra.

24,2020/10/25,BJP suffers another jolt as Independent MLA joins Sena,"Independent MLA Geeta Jain from the Mira Road-Bhayander constituency on Saturday joined the Shiv Sena in the presence of Chief Minister and party chief Uddhav Thackeray.

The joining comes a day after former senior leader of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Eknath Khadse joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), another member of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.

Following her victory in the election in 2019 as an Independent MLA after defeating BJP candidate Narendra Mehta, Ms. Jain had extended support to the BJP. She was part of a team of Independent MLAs who had backed the BJP. Her entry to the Sena is seen as the second jolt to the BJP in one week.

When with the BJP, Ms. Jain was the mayor of the Mira Road-Bhayander Municipal Corporation. In 2019, she was seeking ticket to contest from the BJP but the party reposed faith in the then sitting MLA, Mr. Mehta. She contested as an Independent and won the poll.

Ms. Jain is the second Independent MLA to have joined the Sena after Water Conservation Minister Shakarrao Gadakh.

Mr. Khadse, who joined the NCP on Friday, had already said that around 12-15 sitting and former BJP MLAs were ready to switch sides.

27,2020/10/25,Chileans vote on whether to rewrite dictatorship-era charter,"If approved, a special convention would begin drafting a new constitution that would be submitted to voters in mid-2022.

Amid a year of contagion and turmoil, Chileans vote Sunday on whether to draft a new constitution for their nation to replace guiding principles imposed four decades ago under a military dictatorship.

The country’s conservative government agreed with the center-left opposition to allow the plebiscite a month after the outbreak of vast street protests that erupted a year ago in frustration over inequality in pensions, education and health care in what has long been one of South America’s most developed nations.

If approved, a special convention would begin drafting a new constitution that would be submitted to voters in mid-2022.

Chile’s current constitution was drafted by the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, and was sent to voters at a time where political parties had been banned and the country was subject to heavy censorship.

It was approved by a 66%-30% margin in a 1980 plebiscite, but critics say many voters were cowed into acceptance by a regime that had arrested, tortured and killed thousands of suspected leftist opponents following the overthrow of an elected socialist government.

“I think that many people went to vote out of fear,” said political scientist Claudio Fuentes, who wrote a book about that plebiscite titled, The Fraud.

“The current constitution has a flaw of origin, which is that it was created during the military dictatorship in an undemocratic process,” said Monica Salinero, a 40-year-old sociologist who supports drafting a new charter.

The free-market principles embodied in that document led to a booming economy that continued after the return to democracy in 1990, but not all Chileans shared.

A minority was able to take advantage of good, privatized education, health and social security services, while others were forced to rely on sometimes meager public alternatives. Public pensions for the poorest are just over $200 a month, roughly half the minimum wage.

Recent polls have indicated heavy backing for a new constitution despite opposition from conservative groups, and expectations among many are high.

Luisa Fuentes Rivera, a 59-year-old food vendor, said there was hope that “with a new constitution we will have better work, health, pensions and a better quality of life for older people, and a better education.”

But historian Felipe Navarrete warned, “It’s important to say that the constitution won’t resolve the concrete problems. It will determine which state we want to solve the problems.”

Claudia Heiss, head of the political science department at the University of Chile, said it would send a signal about people’s desires for change, and for a sort of politics that would “allow greater inclusion of sectors that have been marginalized from politics.”

“No, Thanks”

Conservative groups fear the revamp could go too far, and endanger parts of the constitution that have helped the country prosper.

“The people have demonstrated saying they want better pensions, better health (care), better education. And the response of the political class is a process that won’t solve the problems and will open a period of uncertainty,” said Felipe Lyon, 28-year-old lawyer and spokesman for the group “No, Thanks” that opposes the change.

The decision to allow the vote came after hundreds of thousands of Chileans repeatedly took to the streets in protests that often turned violent.

The vote was initially scheduled for April, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic which has killed some 13,800 Chileans, with more than 500,000 people infected by the new coronavirus.

Officials trying to ensure voters feel safe are barring infected persons or those close to them from the polls. Voters must wear masks — dipping them only briefly for identification purposes — and must bring their own pencils.

The manner of drafting a new constitution is also on Sunday’s ballot. Voters will choose between a body of 155 citizens who would be elected just for that purpose in April, or a somewhat larger convention split equally between elected delegates and members of Congress.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/b880xw/article32939826.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHILECONSTITUTIONREFERENDUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chileans-vote-on-whether-to-rewrite-dictatorship-era-charter/article32939827.ece

Marc Short, the chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence, has tested positive for the new coronavirus, a spokesman for the vice president said on October 24.

“Vice President Pence and Mrs. Pence both tested negative for COVID-19 today, and remain in good health,” said Devin O’Malley, adding that Mr. Pence would maintain his schedule “in accordance with the CDC guidelines for essential personnel.”

Mr. Short, the latest in a list of figures connected to Donald Trump's administration to test positive for the virus, began quarantine and was assisting in the contract tracing process, the spokesman said.

29,2020/10/25,"US set coronavirus cases infection record; deaths near 224,000","The total US caseload reported on the site Friday was 83,757, topping the 77,362 cases reported on July 16.

The US coronavirus caseload has reached record heights with more than 83,000 infections reported in a single day, the latest ominous sign of the disease’s grip on the nation, as states from Connecticut to the Rocky Mountain West reel under the surge.

The US death toll, meanwhile, has grown to 223,995, according to the COVID-19 Dashboard published by Johns Hopkins University. The total US caseload reported on the site Friday was 83,757, topping the 77,362 cases reported on July 16.

The impact is being felt in every section of the country — a lockdown starting Friday at the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s reservation in South Dakota, a plea by a Florida health official for a halt to children’s birthday parties, dire warnings from Utah’s governor, and an increasingly desperate situation at a hospital in northern Idaho, which is running out of space for patients and considering airlifts to Seattle or Portland, Oregon.

We’ve essentially shut down an entire floor of our hospital. We’ve had to double rooms. We’ve bought more hospital beds, said Dr Robert Scoggins, a pulmonologist at the Kootenai Health hospital in Coeur d’Alene.

Our hospital is not built for a pandemic.

In the southern Idaho city of Twin Falls, St. Luke’s Magic Valley Medical Center said it would no longer accept children because it is overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Except for newborns, all under age 18 will be sent 128 miles (206 kilometers) away in Boise.

Among those in northern Idaho joining Scoggins at a meeting of Idaho’s Panhandle Health District was board member Walk Kirby.

People are dying, they’re going to keep dying and catching this stuff, Kirby said. How many people won’t wear a mask? The same people that won’t get vaccinated for it. Utah’s Gov Gary Herbert proclaimed Friday to be a record day for Utah — but not a good one as COVID-19 cases reached an all-time high for the state.

Up until now, our hospitals have been able to provide good care to all COVID and non-COVID patients who need it, he said.

But today we stand on the brink. If Utahans do not take serious steps to limit group gatherings and wear masks, our healthcare providers will not have the ability to provide quality care for everyone who needs it.

By public health order, masks are required in 21 counties, said Herbert, urging Utah residents to wear one whenever they are around someone outside their immediate household.

The seven-day rolling average for new daily COVID-19 cases in the U.S. surpassed 61,140 Thursday, compared with 44,647 two weeks ago. The record was reached July 22 when the rolling average was 67,293 in the midst of a summer outbreak driven largely by surges of the virus in Florida, Texas, Arizona and California.

The US surge mirrors a similarly widespread spike in Europe, where Rome, Paris and other major cities are reining in nightlife as part of the increasingly drastic measures undertaken to slow the spread of the pandemic.

French authorities said the country had recorded over 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic, becoming the second country in Western Europe after Spain to reach that number.

30,2020/10/25,UN nuclear weapons ban treaty to enter into force,"As of Friday, the treaty had 49 signatories, and UN officials said the 50th ratification from Honduras had been received.

The United Nations announced Saturday that 50 countries have ratified a UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons triggering its entry into force in 90 days, a move hailed by anti-nuclear activists but strongly opposed by the United States and the other major nuclear powers.

As of Friday, the treaty had 49 signatories, and UN officials said the 50th ratification from Honduras had been received.

This moment has been 75 years coming since the horrific attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the founding of the UN which made nuclear disarmament a cornerstone, said Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize-winning coalition whose work helped spearhead the nuclear ban treaty.

The 50 countries that ratify this Treaty are showing true leadership in setting a new international norm that nuclear weapons are not just immoral but illegal.

The 50th ratification came on the 75th anniversary of the ratification of the UN Charter which officially established the United Nations and is celebrated as UN Day.

The United Nations was formed to promote peace with a goal of the abolition of nuclear weapons, Fihn said.

This treaty is the UN at its best — working closely with civil society to bring democracy to disarmament.

The United States had written to treaty signatories saying the Trump administration believes they made a strategic error and urging them to rescind their ratification.

The US letter, obtained by The Associated Press, said the five original nuclear powers -- the US, Russia, China, Britain and France -- and America’s NATO allies stand unified in our opposition to the potential repercussions of the treaty.

It says the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, known as the TPNW, turns back the clock on verification and disarmament and is dangerous to the half-century-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, considered the cornerstone of global nonproliferation efforts.

The TPNW is and will remain divisive in the international community and risk further entrenching divisions in existing nonproliferation and disarmament fora that offer the only realistic prospect for consensus-based progress, the letter said.

It would be unfortunate if the TPNW were allowed to derail our ability to work together to address pressing proliferation.

Fihn has stressed that the nonproliferation Treaty is about preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and eliminating nuclear weapons, and this treaty implements that. There’s no way you can undermine the Nonproliferation Treaty by banning nuclear weapons. It’s the end goal of the Nonproliferation Treaty.

The NPT sought to prevent the spread of nuclear arms beyond the five original weapons powers. It requires non-nuclear signatory nations to not pursue atomic weapons in exchange for a commitment by the five powers to move toward nuclear disarmament and to guarantee non-nuclear states’ access to peaceful nuclear technology for producing energy.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has supported the nuclear weapons ban treaty, calling it a very welcome initiative.

It is clear for me that we will only be entirely safe in relation to nuclear weapons the day where nuclear weapons no longer exist, he said in an interview Wednesday with AP.

We know that it’s not easy. We know that there are many obstacles.

He expressed hope that a number of important initiatives, including US-Russia talks on renewing the New Start Treaty limiting deployed nuclear warheads, missiles and bombers and next year’s review conference of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, will all converge in the same direction, and the final objective must be to have a world with no nuclear weapons.

The treaty was approved by the 193-member UN General Assembly on July 7, 2017 by a vote of 122 in favour, the Netherlands opposed, and Singapore abstaining. Among countries voting in favor was Iran. The five nuclear powers and four other countries known or believed to possess nuclear weapons — India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel — boycotted negotiations and the vote on the treaty, along with many of their allies.

Setsuko Thurlow, a survivor of the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, who has been an ardent campaigner for the treaty, said: When I learned that we reached our 50th ratification, I was not able to stand.

I remained in my chair and put my head in my hands and I cried tears of joy, she said in a statement.

I have committed my life to the abolition of nuclear weapons. I have nothing but gratitude for all who have worked for the success of our treaty.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vk5eqk/article32732907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UN-ASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-nuclear-weapons-ban-treaty-to-enter-into-force/article32939701.ece
31,2020/10/25,"Referendum choice not black and white, Chileans say","People hope to have a better education, health and housing by reforming the constitution

One hopes for a “legitimate” constitution, the other believes Chile's problems can be resolved without a new one -- two voters on opposite sides lay out their arguments ahead of Sunday's referendum, and say the choice facing the country is a tricky one.

'Ethics and legitimacy'

Ernesto Quintana says he'll be ticking “Apruebo” (I agree) for “reasons of ethics and legitimacy” when he gets to his Santiago polling center on Sunday.

The current constitution, he says, prevents social progress.

“The current constitution....was written during the dictatorship, a period of restriction of freedoms, without participation of the citizens, of course, and in the context of terror,” Quintana, a Santiago-based psychologist, told AFP.

“It is a constitution that favors the neo-liberal system at an extreme level, it has perpetuated a totally unequal system,” said the 38-year-old, who has taken part in several mass demonstrations in the capital since the beginning of the social crisis in October 2019.

Not a member of any political grouping, he says he wants health and education -- essentially the responsibility of the private sector in the copper-rich South American country -- to become fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution.

“Today people who have money have better education, better health, better housing, ....and all these things could be reformed by changing the constitution.”

The son of communist militants hunted down under Augusto Pinochet, Chile's military ruler between 1973-1990, Quintana will also vote for a new charter to be drafted by a “Constituent Convention” composed solely of elected citizens, and not by a “mixed convention” that would combine citizens with lawmakers.

“I don't want the political parties to be involved,” said Quintana, who simply doesn't trust the country's politicians to do the job.

He sees the Constituent Convention “as an opportunity for the voice of all citizens to be taken into account in a more direct, more participatory way.”

‘Not pro-Pinochet'

Santiago restauranteur Francisco Pereira is keen to point out that being against a re-write of the constitution and voting “Rechazo” (I reject) doesn't makes one pro-Pinochet.

He agrees that Chile needs “change” and in particular more egalitarian health, education and transport systems.

He says he even “applauded” when Chileans first took to the streets in October last year to demand more social justice.

For him, however, the demonstrators were gathering “to change laws, to improve pensions, to denounce inequalities in general,” but not specifically to change the constitution.

The 48-year-old stresses that he has “always been against Pinochet, against the dictatorship”. But he says that in a perfect storm of social crisis, violent demonstrations and the coronavirus pandemic which has hit Chile so hard, the timing is simply not right to change such a fundamental pillar of the law.

“The problem is that we are deciding to change the constitution in a moment of crisis, and it's not a good basis on which to base changing the constitution,' he said.

“Chile does not need constitutional change at the moment, like every other country in the world, it's in the middle of a serious economic crisis.”

“Social reforms require money, and the instability” -- due to the referendum and social tensions -- “is not very attractive for investment, for growth.”

Lawmakers should take advantage of the kind of political consensus displayed in Congress last November when left and right-wing blocs signed an agreement to hold the referendum.

“Before wanting to change the constitution, we must first solve problems through the law,” by voting reforms through Congress, Pereira said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6mkgul/article32939477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHILE-POLITICS-REFERENDUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/referendum-choice-not-black-and-white-chileans-say/article32939478.ece
32,2020/10/25,U.S. presidential elections 2020 | Fired-up New Yorkers stand in line for hours to cast early votes,"A majority of New York voters haven’t supported a Republican candidate for president since Ronald Reagan’s re-election in 1984.

New Yorkers jammed polling places and stood in line for hours to cast ballots on the state’s first day of early voting on Saturday, rushing to record their choices 10 days ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.

Long lines formed before polls opened across New York City and Long Island, videos on social media showed, as New Yorkers joined a flood of more than 56 million Americans across the country who have cast early ballots at a record-setting pace.

Saturday was the first time that voters in New York, a reliably Democratic state where Democrat Joe Biden has a wide lead in polls over Republican President Donald Trump, have been allowed to vote early in a presidential election.

A majority of New York voters haven’t supported a Republican candidate for president since Ronald Reagan’s re-election in 1984. Early in-person voting will continue in the state until Nov. 1.

Vanessa Reilly, 38, a computer programmer, cast an early vote for Biden at the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn. She said she wanted to be sure her vote was counted.

“I just want to avoid all the chaos on Election Day itself,” Reilly said, adding that a lot of people were showing up to register their opposition to Trump.

“Given this year and given the current president we need to send a clear message that his policies dont work, that theyre offensive, that they dont represent American values,” she said.

About 56.5 million Americans already have cast early ballots across the country either in person or by mail, a pace that could lead to the highest voter turnout rate in more than a century, according to data from the U.S. Elections Project.

The rush to vote is a sign of intense interest in the contest between Trump and Biden, as well as concerns about avoiding crowded polling places on Election Day and reducing the risk of exposure to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 224,000 Americans.

The high level of early voting has led Michael McDonald, the University of Florida professor who administers the U.S. Elections Project, to predict a record turnout of about 150 million, representing 65% of eligible voters, the highest participation rate since 1908.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ynkiph/article32939445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-NEW-YORK-BEGINS-EARLY-VOTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-elections-2020-fired-up-new-yorkers-stand-in-line-for-hours-to-cast-early-votes/article32939447.ece

The military spokesman for Yemen's Houthi movement said in a tweet on Saturday it had targeted the Jizan and Abha airports and the Khamis Mushait base in Saudi Arabia with drones.

Earlier on Saturday and in two statements on Friday, the Saudi-led coalition had said it had intercepted and destroyed three explosive-laden drones from the Houthis aimed towards the southern region of Saudi Arabia.

34,2020/10/25,Facebook seeks to block political ad targeting research,"The researchers are collecting information using an extension, or plugin, called AdObserver that can be installed on a web browser and copies Facebook ads into a public database.

Facebook has demanded that New York University pull the plug on a research project into the platform's targeting practices for political ads, saying it is a violation of terms to collect user data.

“A week ago, Facebook sent me a (cease and desist order) asking us to take down AdObserver and delete our data. The public has a right to know how political ads are targeted, so we will not be complying with this request,” Laura Edelson, a PhD student and researcher with NYU Ad Observatory, said in a post Friday.

With just 10 days until the U.S. election, Facebook is being sharply scrutinized for the role it plays in campaigning, and the way candidates and political groups use the social media network to influence voters.

The researchers are collecting information using an extension, or plugin, called AdObserver that can be installed on a web browser and copies Facebook ads into a public database.

Ms. Edelson and others are tracking information such as which profiles are targeted by which types of ads.

“We informed NYU months ago that moving forward with a project to scrape people's Facebook information would violate our terms,” Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne said.

“Our Ad Library, which is accessed by more than 2 million people every month, including NYU, already provides more transparency into political and issue advertising than TV, radio or any other digital ad platform.”

But Ms. Edelson said the system is not perfect.

“Our cybersecurity analysis shows vulnerability in Facebook's transparency algorithms that reveals they routinely miss including political ads in its public archive,” she said.

California-based Facebook has tightened its rules on political advertising ahead of the 2020 election. In particular, it has prohibited attempts to undermine the electoral process and banning certain racist or xenophobic statements.

The social media network is also banning new political advertising in the week before the November 3 election.

“Today is a victory for humanity, and a promise of a safer future,” Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said in a statement.

Other NGOs also welcomed the news, including the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), a coalition that won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize for its key role in bringing the treaty to fruition.

“Honduras just ratified the Treaty as the 50th state, triggering entry into force and making history,” ICAN said in its tweet.

The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons -- which bans the use, development, production, testing, stationing, stockpiling and threat of use of such weapons -- was adopted by the UN General Assembly in July 2017 with the approval of 122 countries.

It is now expected to enter into force in January 2021.

The clutch of nuclear-armed states, including the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia, have not signed the treaty.

However, campaigners hope that it coming into force will have the same impact as previous international treaties on landmines and cluster munitions, bringing a stigma to their stockpiling and use, and thereby a change in behavior even in countries that did not sign up.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fhvaq0/article32939206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DENMARK-UN-75YEARS-HISTORY-DIPLOMACY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons-to-enter-into-force-un/article32939207.ece
36,2020/10/25,"As it hits 1 million coronavirus cases, Colombia prepares for vaccine","Colombia surpassed 1 million infections on Saturday afternoon, becoming the eighth country globally to do so, tallying 1,007,711 confirmed infections and 30,000 deaths.

In a warehouse near Bogota’s airport, behind a heavy cold storage door, sit boxes upon boxes of lifesaving vaccines for everything from yellow fever to polio, awaiting transport to the furthest reaches of Colombia.

The tall shelves, kept at a chill 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit), are half-empty - leaving plenty of room for an eventual COVID-19 vaccine.

Colombia surpassed 1 million infections on Saturday afternoon, becoming the eighth country globally to do so, tallying 1,007,711 confirmed infections and 30,000 deaths.

As scientists around the world race to find a coronavirus inoculation, Colombia says it is ready to distribute any vaccine which proves effective.

Its preparedness is thanks to decades of work on a free government immunization program which offers 21 vaccines to everyone in the South American nation - among the region’s most generous for vaccine provision.

“We have a really strong vaccination program that serves as a model and which will incorporate the new formula that will arrive against COVID,” Gerardo Burgos, secretary general of the health ministry, told Reuters.

The program covers not just Colombia’s own population of about 50 million people but also more than 1.7 million Venezuelan migrants and includes everything from infant shots to human papillomavirus.

The country distributes about 23 million doses per year.

Colombia has already committed $213 million to the global COVAX initiative, guaranteeing COVID-19 vaccinations for about 10 million people. People over 60, those with pre-existing conditions and healthcare workers will be immunized first.

Colombia’s cases have climbed steadily despite more than five months of a gradually loosened quarantine which has battered the economy and sent unemployment soaring.

Besides the cost of the vaccine itself, the government plans to spend up to 300 billion pesos, about $78 million, on transport, information campaigns, regional warehouse expansions and personnel to inoculate the initial 10 million recipients, Mr. Burgos said.

The Bogota warehouse can hold about 50 million vaccine doses, Mr. Burgos said, and is regularly at about 50% capacity.

But there will be challenges - some old, some new.

Reaching remote populations in Colombia’s mountains and jungles will be as difficult with a COVID vaccine as it is with other immunizations.

“It’s not easy to have to navigate rivers and then walk or have to go with animals, on horseback,” Mr. Burgos said.

Potential vaccines requiring extreme cold storage could also prove difficult, he said.

“The great novelty could be in the challenge that may be created by vaccines which demand refrigeration below -60, -70 degrees (Celsius),” Mr. Burgos said.

The country could mount refrigeration sites in major cities to guarantee access for as many people as possible, he said, and expects manufacturers to share information about transportation.

Some companies developing exceptional cold storage vaccines have said they are working to make injections last longer in transit.

Colombia typically packs vaccines into thick coolers with special ice packs which keep them at between 2 degrees and 8 degrees Celsius for up to 36 hours.

Workers were readying 9,000 doses of rotavirus vaccine, among others, to ship to the northeastern province of Cesar when Reuters visited the warehouse.

“We’ve made great efforts,” Mr. Burgos said. “Because in the end our responsibility is for all Colombians.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/j8w5jl/article32939153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COLOMBIA-HEALTH-VIRUS-TEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/as-it-hits-1-million-coronavirus-cases-colombia-prepares-for-vaccine/article32939154.ece

Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a phone call on Saturday that Belarus and Russia were ready to respond jointly to external threats, Russian agencies quoted Belarus state media as saying.

Mr. Lukashenko, who is holding on to power despite major protests in recent weeks calling for him to resign, is facing the prospect of a national strike that could begin on Monday following an ultimatum set by opposition leaders.

Mr. Lukashenko has shown no sign he will heed the ultimatum and step down. Protests against his 26-year rule began following an Aug. 9 election victory his opponents say was rigged.

Mr. Lukashenko had sought to mend fences with the West in recent years and Pompeo had travelled to Belarus in February in a bid to “normalise” ties. But the crisis after the disputed election pushed Mr. Lukashenko back closer to traditional ally Russia.

Washington has imposed sanctions on Belarus officials following violent crackdowns at demonstrations in Minsk and across the country.

Protesters shouting slogans and waving red-and-white opposition flags marched through the streets of Minsk on Saturday, footage taken by local media showed.

“Russia does not interfere in the internal affairs of Belarus. At the same time, the countries are ready to jointly respond to emerging external threats,” Russia's Interfax news agency cited Belarus state television as saying, describing the call.

President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden gave starkly contrasting messages on Saturday about the coronavirus pandemic, taking their campaigns for the White House on the road as COVID-19 cases surged again.

Mr. Trump addressed a few thousand supporters at a tightly packed, in-person, outdoor rally in North Carolina, one of the battleground states in the Nov. 3 election. He again said America was turning the corner in the fight against COVID-19 and mocked Mr. Biden’s more cautious campaigning style.

Mr. Biden, a former vice president, addressed supporters in about 130 vehicles at a drive-in rally in the swing state of Pennsylvania and warned of a grim winter ahead unless the Trump administration did a better job of halting the disease, which has killed 224,000 Americans.

Opinion polls show Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump nationally, but the race is much closer in the battleground states that will decide the election. Mr. Trump was headed to large rallies in two more of those states, Ohio and Wisconsin, later on Saturday.

In Lumberton, North Carolina, he told supporters he was offering a fast recovery from the economic damage wrought by virus lockdowns, which have devastated small businesses and put millions out of work.

“It’s a choice between a Trump super boom and a Biden lockdown,” the Republican president said. “We are rounding the turn,” he said, repeating a claim he has been making for months that America is close to getting the better of the virus.

By contrast, Mr. Biden warned that the cold months ahead could be even harsher due to a resurgence of the virus, which has killed more people in the United States than anywhere else and is on the rise in several battleground states.

“It’s going to be a dark winter ahead unless we change our ways,” he said of Mr. Trump’s attempts to contain the coronavirus.

Mr. Biden was addressing supporters in the town of Bristol who had gathered in pickup trucks or cars, many with their windows or sunroofs down, to avoid possible coronavirus infection. Mr. Biden’s campaign limited each vehicle to a maximum of four passengers.

At one point, Mr. Biden called out a group of Trump supporters who were shouting into microphones nearby. “We dont do things like those chumps out there with the microphone are doing. The Trump guys. Its about decency.”

At his event in Lumberton, Mr. Trump made fun of the Biden rally, which he said he had seen on television.

“There were so few cars. I’ve never seen an audience like that,” he said. “It was a tiny, tiny little crowd. You could hear the cars: honk honk.”

COVID-19 Surging

The United States set a single-day record of more than 84,000 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, with the spike in infections hitting election swing states Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

North Carolina reported 2,584 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, down from a record high of 2,716 the day before.

Many states have expanded in-person early voting and mail-in ballots as a safer way to vote during the pandemic.

Mr. Trump voted in his adopted home of Florida on Saturday, joining more than 56 million Americans who have cast early ballots at a record-setting pace.

Mr. Trump cast his ballot at a library in West Palm Beach, near his Mar-a-Lago resort, after switching his permanent residence and voter registration last year from New York to Florida, a must-win battleground for his re-election bid.

“I voted for a guy named Trump,” he told reporters after voting.

With 10 days to go in the campaign, the pace of early voting could lead to the highest voter turnout rate in more than a century, according to data from the U.S. Elections Project.

Mr. Trump has regularly condemned mail-in voting without evidence as prone to fraud, even though experts say it is as safe as any other method.

The large number of early voters is a sign of the intense interest in this year’s election, as well as concerns about avoiding crowded polling places on Election Day and reducing the risk of exposure to the coronavirus.

In New York state, voters jammed polling places and stood in line for hours to cast ballots on the state’s first day of early voting on Saturday. Long lines formed before polls opened across New York City and Long Island, videos on social media showed.

In Pennsylvania, polls show Mr. Biden narrowly leading. A Reuters/Ipsos survey released earlier this week showed Mr. Biden with a four-percentage point advantage over Mr. Trump in the state, down from seven points the week before.

Mr. Biden got some help again on Saturday from former President Barack Obama, who held a drive-in rally in Miami.

France recalled its ambassador to Turkey for consultations after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said President Emmanuel Macron needed mental health treatment and made other comments that the French government described as unacceptably rude.

Mr. Erdogan questioned his French counterpart’s mental condition while criticizing Mr. Macron’s attitude toward Islam and Muslims. His remarks at a local party congress were an apparent response to statements Mr. Macron made this month about problems created by radical Muslims in France who practice what the French leader termed “Islamist separatism.”

“What is the problem of this person called Mr. Macron with Islam and Muslims?” Mr. Erdogan asked rhetorically during his Justice and Development party meeting in the central Anatolian city of Kayseri.

“What else can be said to a head of state who does not understand freedom of belief and who behaves in this way to millions of people living in his country who are members of a different faith?” the Turkish leader continued.

The French presidency reacted hours later with a statement that said, “Excess and rudeness are not a method” and “We are not accepting insults.”

Using unusually strong language, the French presidency said, “We demand Mr. Erdogan to change his policy, which is dangerous in all aspects.”

The presidency point out that Mr. Erdogan, a devout Muslim, did not offer condolences following the beheading near Paris last week of a teacher who had shown in class some caricatures of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad. French judicial authorities are investigating the killing as an Islamist terror attack.

41,2020/10/25,Venezuelan opposition figure Lopez abandons Caracas refuge to flee abroad,"Mr. Lopez’s party, Popular Will, did not say how he left Venezuela, though two people familiar with his exit said he emigrated via Colombia

Venezuelan opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez abandoned the Spanish ambassador’s residence in Caracas on Saturday to flee the country, more than a year after seeking refuge there to escape house arrest, his party said.

Mr. Lopez’s party, Popular Will, did not say how he left Venezuela, though two people familiar with his exit said he emigrated via Colombia. A Spanish government source said his arrival in Spain, where his wife now lives, was “imminent.”

Mr. Lopez was jailed in 2014 after leading protests against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. In moments still memorialized in images on opposition banners, he was pictured being pulled into a military vehicle with a Venezuelan flag in one hand and a white flower in the other.

He was provisionally released in 2017. From house arrest, he mentored Juan Guaido, a young Popular Will delegate who early last year was elected head of the opposition-controlled congress. Counseled by Mr. Lopez, Guaido then invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in a bid to unseat Mr. Maduro.

In April 2019, when Guaido spurred a brief military revolt against Mr. Maduro, Mr. Lopez appeared on the streets alongside him. After the uprising fizzled, Mr. Lopez sought shelter at the Spanish ambassador’s residence.

Mr. Lopez’s wife, Lilian Tintori, who joined him at the residence, managed to leave for Spain that May, along with their daughter.

Guaido confirmed Mr. Lopez’s escape in a Twitter message and ridiculed Mr. Maduro for failing to capture him. “Making a mockery of your repressive apparatus, we managed to get Leopoldo Lopez out of the country,” Guaido said.

Popular Will, in a statement, said Mr. Lopez had left the Spanish residence “to drive new actions for Venezuela’s freedom.”

Mr. Lopez’s relationship with his Spanish hosts had sometimes been fractious. After granting Mr. Lopez access to the residence, acting Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said Spain would not allow its embassy in Caracas to be used as an opposition center and it would limit Mr. Lopez’s political activity.

Borrell said at the time that the Spanish government would not turn Mr. Lopez over to the Venezuelan authorities, but it would not grant him asylum as he would have to request it once in Spanish territory.

On Saturday, the Spanish foreign ministry said on Twitter that Mr. Lopez’s decision to leave was “voluntary and personal.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a3accx/article32938612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LEOPOLDOLOPEZ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/venezuelan-opposition-figure-lopez-abandons-caracas-refuge-to-flee-abroad/article32938613.ece
42,2020/10/25,Afghan forces kill senior al Qaeda leader al-Masri who was on FBI most wanted list,"Al-Masri has been charged in the United States with having provided material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organisation, and conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals.

Afghan security forces have killed Abu Muhsin al-Masri, a senior al Qaeda leader who was on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Most Wanted Terrorists list, Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) said in a tweet late on Saturday.

Al-Masri has been charged in the United States with having provided material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organisation, and conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals.

Al-Masri, believed to be al Qaeda's second-in-command, was killed during a special operation in Ghazni province in eastern Afghanistan, said the NDS, adding that he was the supreme leader of the organization in the Indian subcontinent.

The al Qaeda operative, who also went by the name Husam Abd-al-Ra'uf, was an Egyptian national, according to the FBI.

Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said fewer than 200 al Qaeda operatives remain in Afghanistan.

This month marks 19 years since the United States invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban rulers, who had harboured al Qaeda militants who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.

The United States has been gradually drawing down its troops from Afghanistan after striking a landmark deal with the Taliban in February.

That deal is set to see foreign forces leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counterterrorism guarantees from the Taliban, which agreed to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and a power sharing formula with the Afghan government.

The intra-Afghan peace process kicked off in Doha last month. Despite the talks, fighting between Taliban and Afghan government forces has raged in recent weeks.

Last week, U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said the Taliban had agreed to “re-set” their commitments under a troop withdrawal deal and reduce the number of casualties in the country.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/afghan-security-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-al-masri/article32938210.ece

President Donald Trump cast his vote Saturday in Florida ahead of another punishing day with three campaign rallies as he works to close the gap with Joe Biden and pull off a 2016-style upset win on November 3.

“I voted for a guy named Trump,” he said, flashing a smile after removing his black mask upon emerging from a polling station in West Palm Beach, not far from the Mar-a-Lago resort he officially made his home last year.

He thus became one of nearly 55 million Americans to cast early ballots in a year when the coronavirus has made in-person voting problematic.

“It was a very secure vote. Much more secure than when you send in a ballot, I can tell you that,” said Mr. Trump, who insists without giving evidence that mail-in voting leads to fraud.

Continuing his frenetic pace, the president was to hop-scotch later in the day from North Carolina to Ohio to Wisconsin -- returning to the White House only minutes before midnight — as he works furiously to make up lost ground.

But the president’s efforts have been inescapably overshadowed by a grim reality seized on by Mr. Biden: the U.S. set a daily record for new COVID-19 cases on Friday, at nearly 83,000, with a further surge expected as cold weather arrives.

“That’s Donald Trump’s presidency,” Mr. Biden said Saturday during a drive-in rally, one of two events planned for the day in his native Pennsylvania, a critical swing state. He spoke from a stage decorated with bales of hay and Halloween pumpkins.

“Yesterday (was) the worst day we’ve ever had,” said Mr. Biden, who has been more restrained than Mr. Trump in his campaigning, and pandemic-conscious.

“At the debate on Thursday night Donald Trump said, and is still saying, we’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. We’re learning how to live with it.”

Mr. Biden added: “What I told him at that debate, we’re not learning how to live with it. You’re asking us to learn how to die with it and it’s wrong.”

The Biden campaign was also deploying a key surrogate, former president and former Biden boss Barack Obama, to speak later in the day in Miami.

Mr. Biden has a firm lead in national polls, and narrower leads in many battleground states like Florida that typically decide the winner of U.S. presidential elections.

The drama of the final Trump-Biden televised debate on Thursday was thought unlikely to move the needle significantly.

But Democrats are not about to forget the stunning upset Mr. Trump pulled off in 2016 when he defeated the favorite Hillary Clinton.

The president’s current gruelling travels aim to repeat that feat.

On Friday, Mr. Trump targeted the politically powerful seniors’ vote in Florida, telling a crowd at the retirement community The Villages that all Mr. Biden talks about is “Covid, Covid, Covid” to “scare people.”

“We’re going to quickly end this pandemic, this horrible plague,” he said.

In fact, the virus has claimed more than 224,000 American lives, with no end in sight.

Referring to Mr. Biden’s warning of a “dark winter” ahead, Mr. Trump insisted the country is instead “approaching the light at the end of the tunnel.”

He then pivoted to his own scare tactics, claiming that Mr. Biden would let in hordes of illegal immigrants including “criminals and rapists and even murderers.”

Lack of leadership

While Mr. Biden has waged a lower-key campaign, even the 77-year-old Democrat is ramping up activity in the final stretch.

In his home state of Delaware on Friday, he gave a speech about economic recovery from the pandemic, slamming Mr. Trump’s record and vowing — as Mr. Trump has — that he would provide a safe coronavirus vaccine to all who want it.

“We are more than eight months into the crisis and the president still doesn’t have a plan,” Mr. Biden claimed. “He’s given up. He quit on you, on your family, on America.

Pivot too late?

Mr. Trump’s campaign has been turned upside down by the coronavirus crisis, which a majority of voters say he has handled poorly.

In addition to the national disaster, Mr. Trump’s reelection bid has been hampered throughout by his own erratic and often bad tempered behavior.

At Thursday’s final televised debate in Nashville, the president pivoted to the more even-keeled leader that aides have long been hoping Americans will see.

44,2020/10/25,"The Hindu Explains | How does America elect its President, and why is winning the popular vote not enough?","When will the U.S. Presidential election result be known?

The story so far: Voting day in the U.S. presidential election is November 3, 2020. However, millions of votes have been cast already, primarily through absentee and mail-in ballots, made available on a scale that is unprecedented in recent times, owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, the pandemic, and the trail of economic destruction that it has left in its wake, have become arguably the top election issues in 2020, with the Republican incumbent, President Donald Trump, defending his approach as the one best suited to a quick recovery, and his Democratic challenger, former Vice-President Joe Biden, attacking the administration’s pandemic response as unscientific, inconsistent and responsible for the deaths of more than 222,000 Americans to date. While Mr. Biden is leading in most federal and regional opinion polls, analysts have been cautious about making bold election predictions given the outcome of the 2016 election. In that election, Mr. Trump defied the odds with his win, even more so because his Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote by a margin of around three million votes.

Given that the U.S. has, to date, had one of the worst COVID-19 numbers of any nation, why is Mr. Trump still in the reckoning?

Mr. Trump enjoys an approval rating of a little more than 42.5%, considered to be low relative to recent U.S. Presidents at a similar phase of their term in office. Nevertheless, his ratings have been somewhat stable over the course of nearly four years in the White House, the principal reason for which is the intensifying polarisation of the U.S. electorate along party lines. This means that on average, a far greater percentage of registered Republicans support Mr. Trump (around 87%), relative to Democrats, whose approval of his performance is at 6%. This partisan split in support has bestowed the Trump campaign with an inherent electoral advantage, because it translates into a disproportionate share of electoral college votes when compared to the popular vote.

Comment | The U.S. election just became more uncertain

Why does the electoral college matter to Mr. Trump’s campaign?

The electoral college refers to a process, wherein, based mostly on a winner-takes-all rule, each U.S. State chooses its electors, who then go on to pick the President and the Vice-President. The college also encompasses counting of the electoral votes by the U.S. Congress. For example, if more than 50% of the voters in the State of New York vote for the Democratic Party, then all the potential electors allocated to that State will be Democratic. Each State has the same number of electors as it does members in its Congressional delegation, namely one for each member in the House of Representatives, and two Senators. Nationwide, there are 538 electors, and to win the presidency, a candidate would be required to secure 270 votes in the electoral college.

A caveat is that Maine and Nebraska appoint individual electors based on the winner of the popular vote for each Congressional district, and then two electors based on the winner of the overall State-wide popular vote. Even though it is rare for either State to have a split vote, Nebraska had one in 2008 and Maine in 2016. The result of this system of representation is that surprisingly few voters truly matter in an election. The reason is that except for a handful of ‘swing States’, which have the potential to flip from one party to the other, all the others have historically only voted one way and are likely to do so this time too. The States that are traditionally considered to swing include Florida (29 votes), Iowa (6 votes), Michigan (16 votes), Nevada (6 votes), New Hampshire (4 votes), North Carolina (15 votes), Ohio (18 votes), Pennsylvania (20 votes) and Wisconsin (10 votes). However, if opinion polls are to be trusted — and that is a questionable assumption — Arizona (11 votes), Georgia (16 votes), Minnesota (10 votes) and even Republican-leaning Texas (38 votes) might be in play.

What happens if there is a tie in the electoral college?

This scenario — of both candidates winning 269 electoral college votes – is not inconceivable. For example, if Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Virginia, Maine (except for its Second District), Colorado, and Nebraska’s Second District went to the Democrats along with the firmly ‘blue States’, the Democrats would have 269 electoral college votes. This would require Mr. Trump to win, in addition to all the traditionally ‘red States’, Arizona and Wisconsin (10 votes) — which he did carry in 2016. But polls show that Mr. Biden is ahead considerably in both the States. Mr. Trump would also have to carry Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and Ohio.

In such a case of an electoral college deadlock, a ‘contingent election’ will be held, wherein the election of the President will pass on to the House of Representatives. Here, the election of President will be decided by each State delegation casting one vote for its preferred candidate. The Congressional record shows that only two Presidential elections, in 1800 and 1824, have been decided in the House.

When will the election result be known?

In ‘normal’ years, most ballots are counted by the end of the voting day, with the result being known late in the night. This despite a small number of mail-in and absentee ballots coming in later, small enough in number that they would not change the overall result.

However, given the need for social distancing and concerns over in-person voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, up to 80 million Americans will likely vote via mail, and in nearly a third of States, votes only need to be postmarked, not received, by the election day. With the U.S. Postal Service facing slowdowns through the pandemic, the likelihood of a decisive number of ballots being counted by November 3 is low.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rzwq5a/article32937721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trump-votejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-hindu-explains-how-does-america-elects-its-president-and-why-is-winning-the-popular-vote-not-enough/article32937601.ece
45,2020/10/25,Nigerian police mobilize to quell worst unrest in two decades,"The unrest, unprecedented since the 1999 return to civilian rule, is the most serious political crisis confronting President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler elected in 2015.

Nigeria’s police chief ordered the immediate mobilisation of all force resources on Saturday to control the worst street violence in two decades stemming from protests against police brutality.

The unrest, unprecedented since the 1999 return to civilian rule, is the most serious political crisis confronting President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler elected in 2015.

Violence, particularly in the commercial capital Lagos, escalated after demonstrators were shot on Tuesday night in the city’s Lekki district during a round-the-clock curfew.

Witnesses blamed soldiers.

Rights group Amnesty International said soldiers and police had killed at least 12 protesters in two districts, though the army has denied soldiers were in Lekki.

Several states, mostly in southern Nigeria, have imposed curfews after two weeks of confrontations between security services and protesters.

The Nigeria Police Force said in a statement its inspector general Mohammed Adamu had ordered the immediate deployment of all assets and resources to end violence, looting and destruction of property by criminals masquerading as protesters.

Lagos state eased curfew restrictions on Saturday to 6 p.m.-8 a.m. Workers took to streets to sweep away broken glass while cars again filled the roads.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mfz6tm/article32937916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIGERIA-PROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nigerian-police-mobilize-to-quell-worst-unrest-in-two-decades/article32937917.ece
46,2020/10/25,"Israeli envoys will travel to Sudan for normalisation deal, Netanyahu says","The agreement, brokered with the help of the United States and announced on Friday, made Sudan the third Arab government to set aside hostilities with Israel in the last two months.

An Israeli delegation will travel to Sudan in coming days after the two countries agreed to take steps to normalise ties, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday.

The agreement, brokered with the help of the United States and announced on Friday, made Sudan the third Arab government to set aside hostilities with Israel in the last two months.

“An Israeli delegation will leave to Sudan in the coming days to complete the agreement,” Mr. Netanyahu said at a news conference.

It was unclear, however, how long it will take for an accord to be completed. The military and civilian leaders of Sudan’s transitional government have been divided over how fast and how far to go in establishing ties with Israel.

The Sudanese premier wants approval from a yet-to-be formed parliament to proceed with a broader, formal normalisation, and that may not be a quick process given the sensitivities and civilian-military differences. It is unclear when the assembly will be created.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision this week to remove Sudan from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism paved the way for the accord, marking a foreign policy achievement for the Republican president as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3, trailing in opinion polls behind Democratic rival Joe Biden.

Trump sealed the Israel-Sudan agreement in a phone call with Mr. Netanyahu and Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and Transitional Council Head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in which he said: “Do you think ‘Sleepy Joe’ could have made this deal?”

Mr. Netanyahu, reliant on bipartisan support for Israel in Washington, responded haltingly: “Well, Mr. President, one thing I can tell you, is ... we appreciate the help for peace from anyone in America.”

Asked at Saturday’s news conference whether he was embarrassed by Mr. Trump’s question, Mr. Netanyahu said: “It is very difficult to embarrass me,” and stressed he was grateful to Trump for his policy toward Israel. “I hope this policy will continue. I don’t want to make any prophecies about the election results.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xf34ad/article32937999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NETANYAHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-envoys-will-travel-to-sudan-for-normalisation-deal-netanyahu-says/article32938000.ece
47,2020/10/25,Bihar Assembly elections | CPI (ML) candidate Mehboob Alam hits the campaign trail in Balrampur,"Concerns over the ‘Narendra Modi brand of fascism’, severe flooding, and anger against Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, are some of the main talking points as this seat in Katihar district goes to polls on November 7

“Moi Mehboob Alam”, spoken in Surjapuri, a dialect with a prominent Bangla twang, is how the CPI (ML) candidate introduces himself to the ones who don't know him, as he races through the bylanes ahead of the Assembly elections in Balrampur constituency, in Katihar district.

He is the sitting legislator from Balrampur and is one of three CPI (ML) legislators who managed to win in the 2015 election, when the CPI (ML) stood alone in the elections with JD (U)-RJD- Congress alliance on one end and BJP-led NDA alliance on the other.

We are in Abadpur police station area near Barsoi, Balrampur at 11:00 a.m. There are no loudspeakers, no banners and no flags. There are no marigold garlands to mark the candidate out. Only a clutch of young men wearing red gamchas, raising slogans creating the mahaul (atmosphere).

“Aapka button kahan dabega? Teen tara jahan rahega (Which button will you press? The one with three stars), Comrade Mehboob Alam ko laal Salaam, laal Salaam,” the urgency slowly building up. It finally reaches a crescendo with “Dekho, dekho, kaun aayaa? Sher aaya, sher aaya.” RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi along with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former president Rahul Gandhi are also hailed during the sloganeering. But there is no visible presence of RJD or Congress leaders.

Mr Alam, 64, outpaces the others as he stops to shake every hand, even those on motorcycles who have stopped because of the procession get a hearty handshake. Those who know him, are pulled into an embrace. There are others who use the opportunity of pulling him aside by hand to whisper their woes.

The distance is covered partly on foot and partly inside his old Bolero with the young men trailing him on motorcycles. Whenever he sees a group of men or women, he would say “tham, tham” and jump out of the car, plunging himself into the crowd. For now there are no speeches. This seat will go to polls on November 7, the last phase, so the final momentum of campaigning is still some time away. So far, it is only door-to-door campaigning, which sometimes, goes on till midnight.

Flood woes

The poll pitch, however, is clear that the “Narendra Modi brand of fascism” has to be destroyed. The narrative includes opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens. “The Modi government brought these to target the Muslims, but this is also hitting hard the Dalits, Adivasis, in fact all marginalised sections of society,” he said.

The more pressing problem, however, is severe flooding that has destroyed the paddy crop. “Farmers here tried thrice to plant paddy, but each time the floods destroyed their crop. Every year we face a similar situation, but the government has no permanent solution to offer,” Mr Alam said. This door-to-door meeting is an election shistachaar (eitquette), otherwise all year round, I am always around and on the the road.”

He is facing his old opponent Barun Jha, who lost out to Mr Alam in the 2015 elections by over 20,000 votes. This time, Mr Alam has the edge once again with Congress and RJD’s support. Though the CPI (ML) workers are clear, the usual glitz of Congress or RJD campaign has no space here.

With Balrampur constituency falling in the kitty of the newly inducted NDA ally - Vikassheel Insaan Party, Mr Jha conveniently shifted from “Phool chap” (BJP) to “Naav Chaap” (VIP). But his posters leave no doubt about where his loyalties lie, with only a stamp size picture of VIP founder Mukesh Sahni on the posters. His election office in the area is also adourned with BJP flags.

The unfiltered anger against Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, which the voters are vocal about, are also helping Mr Alam’s case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/qmc1oy/article32940693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG40971,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-cpi-ml-candidate-mehboob-alam-hits-the-campaign-trail-in-balrampur/article32940694.ece

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is tired and no longer able to manage Bihar, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said on Sunday, drawing sharp retorts from leaders of the ruling NDA.

Mr. Yadav, 31, apparently referring to the age of the 69- year-old Chief Minister, said that he has got tired due to which he gives up when faced with a difficult situation — be it the coronavirus pandemic or Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) outbreak in Muzaffarpur.

“It seems that he has become energyless from the kind of boring, meaningless speeches he is giving and the things he is doing. Nitish Kumar is tired now and he is no longer able to manage Bihar,” Mr. Yadav said.

The comment drew sharp reactions from leaders of the ruling coalition who termed it “meaningless“.

JD(U) State president Basistha Narayan Singh said: “Mr. Kumar is more energetic than many youths. He works for 14-15 hours a day, which many youngsters will not be able to do...The tired comment is bereft of any logic.”

State minister Sanjay Kumar Jha hit back at Mr. Yadav, saying the Chief Minister is at least not a “class 9 fail like him“.

“He is just making meaningless comments,” Mr. Jha said.

Union Minister of State for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey too derided the comment, saying that NDA leaders always work with energy for the development of the State and the country.

Reacting to a similar comment by Mr. Yadav, the Chief Minister recently said, “He says I am tired, let him first answer where was he when coronavirus hit Bihar.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/r1k2c7/article25727817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NITISHKUMAR-TEJASWI,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/tejashwi-yadav-says-nitish-kumar-is-tired-faces-criticism-from-jdu-bjp/article32940450.ece
49,2020/10/25,Meet the ghost,"Is that Nana inviting them to enter his room? What’s going on?

The story so far: Nana will meet the children in his own bedroom, which is the site of strange happenings. What will they find when they go inside?

“I see you’ve brought Fuzz a treat!” Maya giggled, as Rocky retrieved Mickey.

“Mean Maya,” said a cross Rocky.

“Then, why bring Mickey along?”

“Mummy’s going out too. Mickey can’t stay alone with hungry cats prowling around the neighbourhood!”

At six, the doorbell rang. “Maya,” whispered Rocky, his face stuck in a pillow. “Why would Nana ring the doorbell?”

“Why would he use a door?” hissed Konica.

Maya poked her head out of the door and saw her mother speaking to Rocky’s mother.

“She must have come to tell aunty something before leaving for the market,” sighed Rocky.

Then they heard the front door click. “She’s gone!” whispered Rocky.

Maya’s mother had disappeared too.

“Perfect!” Konica stood up. “Let’s get into Nana’s bedroom. You say ‘hi’ to him, I’ll get a selfie with him, and, Rocky, be quick with your alien questions.”

Maya tapped the door. “What do you expect, Maya?” Konica grunted. “Nana to say ‘come in’!”

Come inside, children.

Spooked out

They felt their innards twist. When they went in, Maya and Rocky stared in disbelief at their mothers seated on Nana’s bed.

“Didn’t I say, no Facebook?” Mrs. Sharma said. Since Maya had earlier operated Nana’s Facebook account from her mother’s device, the notifications showed up. All along it had been Maya’s mother responding in Nana’s name.

“See? Didn’t I tell you both that there was no ghost? But no! You all wouldn’t believe me,” grunted Konica. “But, aunty, I still don’t understand. Maya told us you brought a glass of milk for Nana.”

“Why do you keep this room always locked?” Maya spoke, finally.

Mrs. Sharma laughed. “All the answers are under Nana’s bed.” Hesitantly, the children bent down for a look.

“Kittens!” they squealed. Konica dragged the cardboard box out. Inside was Fuzz, curled with three white-and-black fuzz balls.

“Fuzz had kittens on Nana’s bed. I didn’t want you to disturb them until they were older, so I kept the door locked,” explained Mrs. Sharma.

“And you cuties have been drinking a lot of milk,” said Maya. Once everyone had left, Maya expected her mother to scold her, but she was surprised.

“No computer classes, Maya!”

“Really?!” Maya hugged her.

“And we’ll spend evenings together. Doing things you enjoy. Like you and Nana did together.”

“Nana and I did Facebook together!” she squealed.

50,2020/10/25,Tale of the first parachute jump,"The first parachute jump of note was performed on October 22, 1797 by Frenchman Andre-Jacques Garnerin. A pioneer in the world of parachuting, Garnerin not only achieved success in his chosen field, but was also able to garner a lot of public interest for it. Join A.S.Ganesh as he jumps into this tale...

The pull of the Earth’s gravity is something that we take for granted these days, but it has been better understood only in the past few centuries. With its effect evident during free fall, humanity has long dreamt about the ability to control that drop. Parachute jumps were one of the first ideas that came about as a solution to this, and it continues to be in vogue even today.

The idea of parachutes were around for some time before it actually became a reality. Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci, widely considered one of the greatest painters ever, conceived the idea in his works and even made sketches of the same during his lifetime.

Slowing down free fall

There were a number of attempts in the centuries that followed, but it was nearly 300 years later that the first parachute jump of note was carried out successfully. The credit for that goes to Frenchman Andre-Jacques Garnerin, who designed and tested parachutes capable of slowing down free fall from high altitudes.

Born in 1769, Garnerin was drawn towards physics from a young age and took to studying the nascent field of ballooning when he got the chance. He worked with a variety of ballooning activities – mainly with his brother Jean-Baptiste-Olivier Garnerin – and was also involved in the flight of hot air balloons.

When he became an inspector with the French army in 1793, he vouched for the use of balloons during military activities. He was, however, captured by the British troops during hostilities that occurred in the French Revolution. The Brits turned him over to the Hungarians, who held him as a prisoner of war.

An idea in prison

While this might seem like an unlikely setting to strike upon an idea, it was during this time that Garnerin thought about employing air resistance to slow down an individual’s fall from an altitude. Even though he never did use a parachute to try escape from the high ramparts of the Hungarian prison he spent a few years in, the idea stuck with him.

On returning to France, Garnerin began making balloon ascents and also acted on his idea of building a parachute. With a canopy 23 feet in diameter attached to a basket with suspension lines, Garnerin readied his first parachute that was umbrella- shaped.

First demonstration

On October 22, 1797, Garnerin gave a first demonstration with his parachute in Paris. Attaching the parachute to a hydrogen balloon, he reached a height of 3,200 feet or 1,000 m. He then jumped onto the basket of his parachute and severed it from the balloon.

As Garnerin had not included an air vent at the top of his parachute, his journey back to the surface of the Earth was far from smooth. His contraption oscillated wildly during the descent, bumped a little and scraped while landing, but Garnerin emerged unscathed.

Apart from perfecting his parachute, which included introducing an air vent at the top, Garnerin did his best to draw more eyeballs to each of his exhibitions, which took place in various cities of northern Europe. He had a woman accompany him as a passenger in one of his balloon flights, which was both highly publicised and controversial.

His wife, Jeanne-Genevieve, was one of the first women to fly on a balloon when she achieved the feat in 1798. In the following year, she became the first woman to do a parachute jump, as she made a successful descent from 900 m.

Garnerin’s most popular jump took place in London, as he came down on his parachute from an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,440 m) in 1802. His design improvements enabled jumping from greater heights than ever before a reality.

For a man who spent most of his life with balloons and parachutes, he also met his end with it. At the construction site of one of his latest innovations, Garnerin died in an accident in 1823. The fundamentals of his parachute design have largely stayed on, with advancements of various kinds allowing for better control during the descents.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/o7tjr1/article32872611.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25istbAndr-JacquesGarnerinbyEdwardHawkeLocker1802jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/garnering-support-for-parachute-jumps/article32872613.ece
51,2020/10/25,AIADMK MLA opposes move to shift Sunday market,"‘It will pave way for resurgence of cases in constituency’

AIADMK floor leader A. Anbalagan on Saturday said he would not allow the Puducherry government to shift the Sunday market to his constituency.

Addressing a press conference here, he said the move would pave the way for a resurgence of COVID- 19 cases in his constituency. Besides, the stretch near the Railway station, where the government was planning to shift the Sunday market, was not suitable to accommodate large gatherings.

There is a famous church and temple in the vicinity. The coming together of a large number of people would create inconvenience to the devotees, he said, adding that he would not allow the market to be shifted to his constituency at any cost. “I am ready to take the responsibility for the law and order situation it may bring,” he added.

Flaying the government for the delay in bringing legislation to obtain 50% of medical seats in private medical colleges under the government quota, Mr. Anbalgan said the Congress government had always taken a stand against the interests of students.

While several States had not implemented the 10% reservation policy for the economically weaker sections, the Union Territory was the first to implement the policy.

The decision to implement the quota had deprived students hailing from socially marginalised sections to get admission into professional courses, Mr. Anbalagan said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/wp5xol/article32938596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THANBALAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/aiadmk-mla-opposes-move-to-shift-sunday-market/article32938597.ece

53,2020/10/25,Union Territory records sharp decline in COVID-19 cases,"Govt. plans to relieve private medical colleges from treating virus infected patients

With COVID-19 cases showing a sharp decline, the Puducherry Health Department will soon start relieving some private medical colleges from treating novel coronavirus infected patients and retain the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Research Institute as the main treatment centre.

Saturday saw the second biggest drop in cases with 128 new admissions registered in the Union Territory. Of the new admissions, the Puducherry region recorded 103 cases. In the last 24 hours, two COVID- 19 deaths were reported while 187 patients were discharged from various hospitals. Currently, there are 3,912 active cases, including 2,335 under home quarantine.

So far, the Union Territory has reported 586 deaths, 34,112 total cases and as many as 29,614 patients have been treated and discharged.

‘Guard to be maintained’

“We are seeing a sharp decline in the last few days. But we are not going to lessen the guard or withdraw any healthcare workers from COVID-19 related work. However, we will slowly relieve private medical colleges from treating infected patients,” S. Mohan Kumar, Director of Health and Family Welfare Services, told The Hindu.

After a sharp drop in new admissions and an increase in recovery rate, around 40% of beds are vacant at the medical college. In the coming days, PHCs will stop referring patients to private institutes. But these institutes would have to maintain a minimum bed strength for treating COVID-19 patients in case of a resurgence in persons getting infected, he said.

“In the present context, we think our medical college, along with Jipmer, can handle the new admissions. The virus is still around and so people will have to be very cautious, especially during the festival season. If people continue to observe protocols, we can get very good results in the next 60 days,” Mr. Kumar said.

The Director said there would not be any let down in the number of samples being tested per day. The numbers would be maintained around 4,000 a day, he said, adding that the department would be touching the 3-lakh mark soon with respect to the number of people tested.

In 24 hours alone, 3,865 people got tested for the virus, taking the total number of those screened in the Union Territory to 2,85,824.

Diogo Jota's second-half header secured a 2-1 win for Liverpool over struggling Sheffield United at Anfield on Saturday but the Premier League champions were made to dig deep for the points.

Sheffield United, still looking for their first win of the season, went ahead in the 13th minute when Sander Berge netted from the penalty spot and could have increased their lead.

But Roberto Firmino levelled in the 41st minute with a tap-in and Jota rose to thump home a header in the 64th minute, shortly after Mohamed Salah had a goal ruled out by VAR.

It was not convincing by Liverpool but they held on to move joint top with Everton on 13 points, although their Merseyside rivals play against Southampton on Sunday.

Mendy was in action again, six minutes later, as he dived to push a Juan Mata snap shot wide of the post.

Searching for a spark to bring the game alive, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brought on Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani in the 58th minute.

Uruguayan Cavani, making his United debut, almost scored from his first touch with a clever flick from a Bruno Fernandes cross that zipped into the side-netting.

56,2020/10/25,Farmer takes the organic route to raise grapes,"It was a successful return to grape cultivation for R.Perumal, 47, alias Surulirajan whose vineyard was destroyed in heavy rain and flash floods in 2005

A farmer of Perambalur has successfully raised a vineyard by cultivating the ‘paneer’ variety of grapes adopting organic practices.

It was a successful return to grape cultivation for R.Perumal, 47, alias Surulirajan whose vineyard was destroyed in heavy rain and flash floods in 2005. He gave up the crop but has raised it again on about 30 cents on his four-acre land after attending a training programme on organic farming and sustainable practices organised by GREAT, a voluntary organisation, with support from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) under its capacity building for adoption of technology initiative.

Mr.Surulirajan, Managing Director, GREAT Perambalur Farmers Producers Company, had taken up grape cultivation in 1999 after seeing vineyards during his travel to different parts of the state and country as a truck driver. “I had raised a vineyard then too though I had been using chemical fertilizers. Last year, I decided to cultivate grapes adopting organic methods. Not only the attempt was successful but fruits are also tasty,” he says. With vineyard located close to the Perambalur-Athur Road on Esanai, many people flock to his vineyard to purchase the fruits. He has used shade nets on the sides and bird nets on top of his vineyard. He had to make an initial investment of about ₹2 lakhs. There is not much recurring investment except for organic inputs and labour. He has installed a micro irrigation system to irrigate the crop from his well.

The crop can continue to yield up to 25 years if it was well taken care of. On an average, fruits can be harvested five times every two years. He has recovered his investment after two harvests. “I get a yield of about 2.5 tonnes and make a profit of about ₹2 lakhs after every harvest,” he said. He is going to raise the crop in another 50 cents. He says farmers can cultivate grapes by adopting organic methods.

Collector V.Santha, who inspected his vineyard and a fertilizer retail outlet run by the Great FPO, urged officials to sensitise farmers to organic farming.

Many farmers have come forward to take up grapes cultivation, said L.S.Naveenkumar, District Development Manager, NABARD, Perambalur. “We plan to support about 15 to 20 farmers on a project mode towards increasing area of coverage under the crop in the district,” he said.

NABARD has extended support two FPOs in Perambalur district and extended a grant of ₹11.4 lakhs each. The GREAT FPO has a fertilizer, seed and pesticide outlet at Esanai after obtaining requisite licences.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/duehdc/article32939812.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY24VINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/farmer-takes-the-organic-route-to-raise-grapes/article32939813.ece

58,2020/10/25,Pre-litigation counselling forum to start working in city,"It has been created to solve civil disputes, says Police Commissioner

The district administration will start a pre-litigation counselling forum to sort out civil disputes from people. The forum, consisting of an officer each from the Revenue Department, Municipal Corporation and the Police Departments, is being set up and will sit in Room No. 15, on the premises of Swarna Bharathi Indoor Stadium on all Wednesdays and Fridays, starting from coming week.

Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha said that many people come to the police stations with civil disputes and they are turned down, as they are civil in nature. Just to lodge a police complaint many return by adding a criminal colour to it, which is wrong. To avoid this problem, the forum has been created, he said.

The officers nominated for the forum are Special Deputy Collector, Ch. Rangaiah, City planner, GVMC, Prabhakar, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Dwaraka Sub-Division, R.V.S.N. Murthy. The complaints received in this forum can be divided into various categories — family disputes, disputes with neighbours/other people, moneylending like disputes relating to chit funds, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes relating to nuisance/other issues, land disputes and others. The officials said that people, who wish to avail the services of the forum, can approach the respective police stations from October 26.

“Parties to the disputes shall be summoned and counselled and the resultant compromise, if any, shall be produced before the Lok Adalat on the same day for passing a final award under Section 22 (c) of the Legal Services Authority Act 1987,” the officials added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/pre-litigation-counselling-forum-to-start-working-in-city/article32938138.ece

Shopping malls and garment stores in the city wore a festive look on the occasion of Navaratri with shoppers thronging them to purchase new clothes for Dasara. Small traders, who had incurred losses due to the lockdown and the restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, are hoping for a revival this Dasara and Deepavali seasons.

Though online shopping sites started festive offers, a good amount of shoppers made beeline for garment stores. Many stores offered special discounts to their customers on saris, kids wear and other sections. Women were seen in large number purchasing saris. Offers like two saris for ₹1,200 attracted women at a shopping mall at Jagadamba Junction.

“We could not celebrate Ganesh puja and a few other festivals since the last six-months due to COVID-19 situation. We plan to celebrate Ayudha Pooja and Bommala Koluvu during the Dasara festival,” said N Shanthi, a resident of Murali Nagar.

Meanwhile, markets were seen overcrowded with people rushing to buy puja materials for the festival. The main roads and bylanes at Jagadamba Junction, Dwaraka Nagar, Gopalapatnam, Old Gajuwaka and Poorna Market were full of festival shoppers.

“Buying clothes from garment stores is a different experience, which we do not get in online purchase. As good discounts are being provided, we are buying for Deepavali also,” said D. Madhav Reddy, an employee of a private company. COVID-19 safety norms were ignored at many places during shopping.

Union Minister Pratap Sarangi on October 25 said that all Indians will be given free COVID-19 vaccine, amidst the demand by Opposition parties in the country for it and not only in poll-bound Bihar as announced by the BJP.

The BJP announcement of free COVID-19 vaccine for Bihar had kicked up a controversy with the Opposition parties tearing into the NDA government alleging that the ruling party was using the pandemic for political reasons.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the announcement was in order as it was an election manifesto announcement.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that all people will be provided vaccines free of cost. An estimated ₹500 will be spent on vaccination of each person,” Mr. Sarangi told reporters after addressing a campaign meeting for the November 3 Assembly bypoll in Balasore.

Mr. Modi in a televised adddress to the nation on October 20 said that Indian scientists are in the process of developing several vaccines that are at different stages of clinical trials and the results seem encouraging.

Mr. Sarangi, the Union Minister of State for Animal Husbandry, Dairy, Fisheries and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises,was responding to a question raised by Odisha Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister R.P. Swain.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Swain sought clarification from Dharmendra Pradhan and Mr. Sarangi, the two Union Ministers from Odisha questioning them for their silence on the BJP’s stand on free COVID-19 vaccination for the people of the State along the lines of the one being promised in Bihar.

The governments of Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and Puduchchery have already announced free of cost COVID-19 vaccines in their States, while Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has demanded free vaccine for all citizens across the country.

Mr. Swain tweeted: “I am asking questions to two Odisha union ministers from Balasore soil to clarify as to why the people of the state will not get free of cost COVID vaccine. The union ministers should clarify BJPs stand on the corona vaccination in Odisha.”

On the State government’s steps for vaccination, Mr. Swain said it has signed an agreement with a vaccine manufacturer and is committed to extend the facility to all people of the State. He, however, did not say whether the State government will provide the vaccine to the people free of cost.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vs4pow/article32940901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PratapSarangi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-all-indians-to-get-free-covid-19-vaccine-says-union-minister/article32940902.ece

BJP president J.P. Nadda on Sunday alleged that the Opposition has become directionless and has started opposing the country in its antagonism towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

He said that Congress leaders opposed the abrogation of Article 370 and indirectly supported Pakistan.

“At a time when the entire country was celebrating after the abrogation of Article 370, Rahul Gandhi contended that injustice was done to the people in Srinagar,” Mr Nadda said while addressing party workers in Rajasthan through video conference.

He was speaking after inaugurating two BJP offices and laying the foundation of six offices in various districts of the State.

“It is unfortunate that the Opposition has gone directionless. It has started opposing the country in its antagonism towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.

The BJP chief said that party workers have the responsibility to support government initiatives to ensure that they reach the people as well as to engage the Opposition in political discourse by giving the right information.

Farm laws

Terming the agrarian reform laws as revolutionary, he said Prime Minister Modi freed the farmers of restrictions, and they can now sell their produce in any market.

He said that the Modi government has worked to secure the country “on land and in air and water”, and referred to the development of border infrastructure that has facilitated swift transport of Army personnel and logistics.

Talking about the newly inaugurated offices in the State, Mr Nadda said while others became a “party of a family”, the BJP was like a “big family” in itself.

He appreciated the work done by the party across the country during the coronavirus lockdown.

Slams Rajasthan government

Mr Nadda also targeted the Congress government in Rajasthan, alleging that the State is reeling from corruption and lawlessness.

Central government employees can submit multiple bills of goods and services purchased in their own name to avail the benefit of the LTC (Leave Travel Concession) cash voucher scheme, according to the Finance Ministry.

The Expenditure Department, under the Ministry, has issued a set of FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) on LTC cash voucher scheme, clarifying that an employee can also avail the scheme utilising the applicable LTC fare without leave encashment.

The government on October 12 announced the LTC cash voucher scheme under which central government employees can purchase any goods or services with GST rate of 12% or above to avail the benefit.

Till now, employees got LTC benefits only on travels made, or had to forgo the amount.

The Ministry said employees can avail the scheme utilising the applicable LTC fare without leave encashment.

“The expenditure should be in accordance with the ratio as prescribed for LTC fare,” it said.

To a query on whether the scheme would be applicable if a particular LTC which is meant to be used for the scheme has been partially availed by either self or members of the family, the FAQ said, “This scheme is applicable to the LTC fare left unutilised during the block year (2018-21).”

On whether an employee with four family members eligible for LTC can avail the scheme for less than four members, the Ministry said an employee can avail the scheme in partial, that is for the LTC part of the eligible family.

“Since this is an optional scheme, if the LTC fare of any member of the family has not been utilised for this purpose, those members can avail LTC subject to extent instructions under LTC rules.”

The FAQ further clarified that multiple bills would be accepted, but purchases should happen within the current financial year ending March.

“The purchase should carry a GST of 12% and above and payment should have been made through digital mode,” it added.

It said reimbursement would be based on production of invoice with details of GST.

“As far as possible, the claim should be made and settled well before March 1, 2021 to avoid any last minute rush and resultant lapse“.

Besides, the invoice which is being submitted for reimbursement under the scheme should be in the name of the employee availing the scheme.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/74mnvk/article32532185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THBUNIRMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-employees-can-submit-multiple-bills-to-avail-ltc-benefit/article32940322.ece
69,2020/10/25,"Plea in Supreme Court seeks transfer of petitions challenging minority status of Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsees","The plea, filed by BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, has also asked the National Commission for Minorities to reconsider the definition of minority.

A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court, seeking a transfer of all pending petitions before various High Courts challenging the validity of the Centre’s 26-year-old notification declaring five communities — Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsees — as minorities.

The plea filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay has urged for a transfer of the cases pending in the Delhi High Court, Meghalaya High Court and Gauhati High Court, which have challenged the constitutional validity of section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, under which the notification was issued on October 23, 1993.

The petition, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, said in order to avoid multiplicity of litigations and conflicting views, the plea has been moved before the Supreme Court.

“Denial of minority rights to real minorities and arbitrary and irrational disbursement of minority benefits to majority infringes upon the fundamental right to the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth,” the plea said.

In his petition, the petitioner said Hindus, who are a majority community according to national data, are a minority in several north-eastern States and in Jammu and Kashmir.

However, the Hindu community is deprived of the benefits that are available to the minority communities in these States, the plea said, adding that the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) should reconsider the definition of minority in this context.

The plea has sought to declare section 2(c) of the NCM Act 1992 “void” and “inoperative” for being “arbitrary”, “unreasonable” and “offending“.

The definition of “minority”, according to Article 29-30 of the Constitution, has left leakages in the hands of the state, which shall be misused and are being misused for political benefits, the petition said, adding that the minority status be granted to Hindus in States where the number of the community members has decreased.

The plea has sought the minority status for Hindus in six States and two Union Territories, where the number of the community members has fallen according to Census 2011.

The petition has stated that according to the 2011 Census, Hindus are a minority in six States — Mizoram (2.75%), Nagaland (8.75%), Meghalaya (11.53%), Arunachal Pradesh (29%), Manipur (31.39%), Punjab (38.40%) — and in the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir (28.44%) and Lakshadweep (2.5%).

“Their minority rights are being siphoned off illegally and arbitrarily to the majority population because neither the Centre nor the State governments have notified Hindus as a ‘minority’ under the National Commission for Minorities Act. Therefore, Hindus are being deprived of their basic rights,” the plea has said.

It has pointed out that Christians are in majority in Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland and there is a significant Christian population in Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Kerala, Manipur, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, but they are treated as a minority community.

Likewise, Sikhs are in majority in Punjab and there is a significant Sikh population in Delhi, Chandigarh and Haryana, but they are treated as a minority community, it said.

Muslims are a majority in Lakshadweep (96.20%), Jammu and Kashmir (68.30%) and there is a significant representation of the community in Assam (34.20%), West Bengal (27.5%), Kerala (26.60%), Uttar Pradesh (19.30%) and Bihar (18%).

However, they are enjoying the “minority” status and communities, which are real minorities, are not getting their legitimate share, jeopardising their basic rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution, the petition has said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m3fafx/article32753866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/plea-in-sc-to-transfer-petitions-challenging-minority-status-of-five-communities/article32940252.ece

India wants an end to the ongoing standoff with China in Eastern Ladakh, but Indian soldiers will not allow even an inch of the country to be taken away by anyone, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Sunday.

“India wants an end to the ongoing border tension with China and restoration of peace. This is our objective. But at times, some nefarious incidents keep happening.

Mr. Singh was accompanied on the visit by Army Chief Gen Manoj Naravane and after the puja, he inaugurated a road in Sikkim built by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) through video-conference. The 19.85 Km alternate alignment of the National Highway 310 was necessitated due to the previous alignment having seen extensive damages due to sinking and other natural hazards, Defence Ministry said in a statement.

Since the standoff along the disputed boundary in Ladakh in May, the Army has been on high alert along the entire LAC. On June 15, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan valley in which China suffered an unknown number of casualties. A government official said China, through diplomatic channels, has accepted five personnel killed including a Commanding Officer.

Tensions flared up again on the South of Pangong Tso on August 29 and 30 after Indian Army occupied some dominating heights in the area on Indian side of LAC thwarting provocative moves by Chinese troops and later also on the ridgelines of Finger 4 on the North Bank. Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have remained inconclusive in finding a way for disengagement and dep-escalation.

Mr. Singh was earlier scheduled to perform the puja at the high-altitude area of Sherathang, near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Sikkim, but that was dropped due to inclement weather, officials stated.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 25 urged people to light a “diya” (lamp) while they celebrate festivals, to honour security forces guarding its borders.

In his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio broadcast, Mr. Modi wished people on Dussehra and said that with many festivals coming up, they need to show patience and follow health guidelines during the celebration of these auspicious occasions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Prime Minister also asked people to keep the “vocal for local” resolve in their mind and give priority to local products while shopping for festivals.

The world is taking note of India’s products, he said, citing the example of rising popularity of Khadi.

Mr. Modi hailed the contribution of soldiers and their service to the nation.

“We have to remember our soldiers, who are standing guard at the borders even in times of festivals. We must celebrate festivals while remembering them. We also have to light a diya in our homes to honour these brave sons and daughters of mother India,” he said.

He paid tributes to India’s first Home Minister Sardar Patel, whose birth anniversary falls on October 31, and asked people to work for the country’s unity through their words and deeds.

Mr. Modi also remembered former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, whose death anniversary is on October 31.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dt3fwb/article32940080.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22thSahayPM-DGOU7SVCEF3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mann-ki-baat-october-25-2020/article32940065.ece
73,2020/10/25,"Coronavirus | WEF chief lauds India’s policy response, voices concern for informal workers","WEF Chairman hails the early lockdown, large-scale food rations and collateral-free credit for small businesses.

Bullish on India’s power to shape the global agenda, the World Economic Forum’s Founder and Chairman Klaus Schwab has said the country’s early policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic was strong and now its biggest opportunity lies in leapfrogging to a more digital and sustainable economy.

He further said he remains optimistic about India and as the country continues its quest to build “a stronger and more equal nation, the world will watch it for inspiration.”

“With its demographic advantage and extensive diversity, India has the power to shape the global agenda and define our collective future,” Mr. Schwab said in an interview from Geneva where the World Economic Forum (WEF) is based.

Mr. Schwab, who founded WEF over 50 years ago, said, “The early policy response in India to mitigate the impact of the pandemic was strong; from an early lockdown, to large-scale food rations to over 800 million people risking starvation, to collateral-free credit for small businesses.”

“But what it couldn’t prevent is that this pandemic has put millions of informal workers, low-income migrant workers and daily-wage earners in a state of extreme insecurity. Protecting their lives and livelihoods is the prime concern today, as it could lead to an even deeper, humanitarian crisis on the back of the ongoing public health crisis,” he said.

Mr. Schwab said as India focuses on building a better future after the pandemic, “its greatest opportunity probably lies in its efforts to leapfrog to a more digital and sustainable economy“.

He further said sadly there was clearly a lack of epidemic preparedness in many countries.

“The notion that a pandemic is a once-in-a-hundred-year event, made many governments and business leaders conclude it was not an immediate threat. In the spring and summer, we paid the price for that,” he said.

“But what matters now, is what we do to put an end to the pandemic as soon as possible, and how we deal with the ongoing threat of a severe second wave,” he noted.

“It is important that we all come together and support those in charge of providing healthcare, whether in the public or the private sector,” Mr. Schwab said.

He observed that the responsibility of epidemic preparedness lies primarily with the government and public health authorities, and less with the private healthcare or pharmaceutical sector in many countries.

“Governments, notably, are responsible for providing a strategic stock of healthcare supplies. In the countries with a public healthcare system, it is also the responsibility of those who manage these systems, to ensure there is enough capacity in hospitals, and enough supply of crucial equipment like respirators,” he noted.

The WEF describes itself as an international organisation for public-private partnership and has been known for various studies and global events hosted by it, including the high-profile Davos Annual Meeting every year on the Swiss Alps that is attended by thousands of world leaders.

The 50th annual meeting, held in January 2020, was the last major global event before almost the entire world got locked down due to the coronavirus pandemic. The next annual meeting has now been postponed to May 2021 and will be held in Lucerne-Burgenstock in Switzerland, instead of Davos.

Mr. Schwab has co-authored a book, titled ‘The Great Reset’, which deals with top priorities before business leaders and policymakers around the world in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

The book also talks about whether the world should get back to where it was before, or should it take the opportunity to make society fairer, smarter and greener, and get humanity off the road to climate catastrophe.

In the interview, Mr. Schwab said the world is at a turning point for humanity today.

“COVID-19 is the most devastating and immediate crisis we are facing, but we are equally going through the worst environmental crisis in human history as well. And socio-economically, the division and inequalities we are facing are the worst in a generation,” he said.

The WEF founder said this scenario cannot be dealt with incrementally and what is needed is ‘A Great Reset’ — a fundamental rethinking of our economies and of our societies.

“We must not only repair the damage but address major deficiencies in our economic and social systems which were apparent before the pandemic broke out. One of the priorities for the Great Reset is to re-define our social contract. That is particularly relevant for emerging economies like India, who have not yet built up social welfare systems to the same degree as some countries in Europe, such as the Scandinavian countries,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ohzfq5/article32939926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THKLAUSSCHWAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-wef-chief-lauds-indias-policy-response-voices-concern-for-informal-workers/article32939927.ece

76,2020/10/25,Chittoor roads turn into cesspools,"Gravel roads in interior villages have become slush pits, making commuting difficult

Chittoor district, for the first time in recent decades, has been witnessing incessant rains from June, with spells of respite in between.

However, the rains in August-October have come to play the villain for several forested villages in the mandals of Bangarupalem, Palamaner, Baireddipalle, V. Kota and Ramakuppam mandals, mostly located alongside the national highways towards Bengaluru and Hosur.

Over a hundred hamlets are nestled inside the forests of these mandals. Surprisingly, the tail-end mandals, which usually receive scanty to deficient rainfall, have received copious rains this season. A majority of the tanks and ponds in the forests at the tri-State junction, flanked by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, are brimming with rainwater. Several roads, mostly gravel, have turned into muddy ponds, making it tough for the people in the forested areas to attend to their daily chores.

About two dozen hamlets in Baireddipalle mandal bore the brunt of the rains. The population generally depends on the forest produce and does farm work in the neighborhood. They have to go to Kuppam to buy essential commodities or to sell their produce, or to visit primary health centres, and have to crisscross roads in rough terrain in order to reach the national highway.

After the COVID-19 lockdown, transport on the remote gravel roads in forested areas took a beating. Now, the situation has only aggravated due to reluctance of the auto-drivers to ply in ankle-deep mud. At several stretches, even riding two-wheelers is a difficult task on the gravel roads, leading to mishaps. In recent months, the mishaps involving two-wheelers, and auto-rickshaws were on the rise, including half a dozen casualties.

Residents of Kotrepalle, Gaddur, Sanipalle, Vengamarapalle and Nellipatla observed that in the absence of any mode of transport, in some emergency situations, they were forced to walk several kilometers in the forest roads to reach Baireddipalle mandal headquarters, and this being a Herculean task for the elderly and children. “Fortunately, the schoolchildren are confined to their homes, which otherwise it would be difficult to even imagine our plight surrounded by forests and muddy roads,” an ex-sarpanch of a remote panchayat said.

A senior forest official said that it was for the first time that the region, between Kuppam and Palamaner, had received considerably good rains in recent months. The problem of gravel roads turning muddy has surfaced in August-September. “If we want to do anything at this stage, it requires a big process to undertake blacktopping of roads in forested areas,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chittoor-roads-turn-into-cesspools/article32938085.ece

The Vijayawada Division of the South Coast Railway Zone(SCRZ) loaded the first-ever maize rake from Ongole to Chavadipalayam, near Erode, in Tamil Nadu on Saturday thereby starting a new traffic from the Ongole section to the neighbouring State under the Business Development Unit (BDU) initiative, a railway release said.

Appreciating the marketing efforts of the staff, Vijayawada Divisional Railway Manager P.Srinivas urged farmers and traders to make use of the new facility for a hassle-free transportation of the produce. The Division has earned ₹11.73 lakh by sending 21 BCN wagons with 1,323 tonnes of maize.

A consignor from Eluru, Sri Durga Traders, has come forward to send maize by rail to Chavadipalayam, the release said.

High loading potential

Considering its loading potential, which is more than 17,000 tonnes, and its cheaper transportation compared to road, the consignor has agreed to load more such rakes, according to the release. The cost per tonne for carrying maize by rail for a distance of 650 km is only ₹886 whereas transporting the same by road would cost ₹1,550.

The Ongole section had also recently started transportation of Bengal gram. Till now, 4.5 rakes were loaded with the produce from Ongole to various destinations, fetching the Division an income of ₹80.17 lakh during this fiscal.

85,2020/10/25,Officials go on whirlwind tour of flood-damaged fields,"In-charge Collector Ravi Pattan Shetty on Saturday undertook a whirlwind visit of agriculture fields hit by the recent rains in the district.

Inspecting the Rythu Barosa Kendrams at Kurnool, Nandyal, Panyam and Dhone along with senior officials, Mr. Shetty asked the farmers to cross-check their names with the list displayed at the RBKs of their respective areas to avail the compensation for the crop losses.

Mr. Shetty was informed that 99% of the enumeration of crop loss was completed in all the revenue divisions and details pertaining to the fields which bore the brunt of the rains along with the names of the farmers. Mr. Shetty asked farmers to approach agriculture officials in case they are unable to find their names at the RBKs.

86,2020/10/25,APSRTC runs buses from Telangana border to fetch home-bound crowd,"Minister pleads TS to reciprocate the gesture

There seems to be no end in sight to the stand off between the road transport corporations of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana with regard to resuming inter-State bus services.

After exhausting all options to break the ice, the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) on Saturday deployed 38 buses at six check-posts on the Andhra-Telangana border to fetch home-bound people in the festival season. “This is to enable Andhra people to visit families during the festival season,” Transport Minister Perni Venkataramaiah said at a press conference in Hyderabad on Saturday.

Of the 38 buses, seven are deployed at the Garikapadu check-post near Jaggayyapet in Krishna district, four at Wadapally check-post, seven at Pylon, 13 at Kallugudem check-post, two at Jeelugumilli and five buses at the Panchalingala check-post.

While the idea is to increase the number of buses based on the public response, the initiative does not seem to have found much acceptance. “The response is poor,” said an official, explaining that this was because people did not want stopovers and the hassle of changing buses multiple times.

Services halted

The APSRTC stopped operating buses on March 21 after lockdown was imposed and after the lockdown was lifted, bus services have been resumed to Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

The Minister informed that though the State RTC officials had been talking with their Telangana counterparts from June 18, a solution still eludes. He requested that Telangana also run buses at least till the border to spare hardships to the travelling public.

Telangana Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar had attributed the delay in solving the issue to Andhra Pradesh’s “adamant” stand, and had also accused it of using “arm-twisting tactics to gain an upper hand”.

Mr. Venkataramaiah brushed it aside and said:”We are very flexible. We came up with multiple options which were not accepted.” He denied that the APSRTC was eyeing profits by capturing the profit-making routes, a charge levelled by the Telangana officials. “Now that the government has taken over the responsibility of the RTC employees’ salaries that works out to be ₹3,600 crore annually, the RTC doesn’t have to bother about the financial burden. From December 2019, it started exploring alternative revenue-generation means and the cargo sector has proven to be one of the sources of income. We are also exploring various other ways,” he explained.

The Minister said the only concern of the government was that if the RTC cuts down on the number of buses it operates on routes which had high public demand, where would it leave the people using our bus services now.

The Minister said a middle ground would be worked out. “Three days festival holidays from Saturday has further delayed the process. The talks will resume on Tuesday and we will find a solution soon,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/apsrtc-runs-buses-from-telangana-border-to-fetch-home-bound-crowd/article32938245.ece
87,2020/10/25,Ongole soaks in festive spirit during Dasara fete,"Durga temples witness flurry of activity

Dasara is the first festival to be celebrated in a befitting manner this year after the outbreak of COVID-19.

Setting aside fears of the pandemic, revellers came out of their homes in large numbers to witness the grand ‘Kalaram’ processions from temples dedicated to Goddess Durga in Ongole.

For the first time after the outbreak of the pandemic, large crowds were seen at places of worship as well as busy market centres in Ongole and other places in Prakasam district.

Devotees enjoyed Pravarchanam, music and dance programmes on the occasion. “We are back in demand at temples organising cultural programmes,” said an orator Ponnuri Venkata Srinivasulu after naratting a religious discourse at the historic Chennakesava temple here.

Following the cultural tradition in vogue, devotees oganised the ‘Kalaram’ procession, first from the Ankathammathalli temple near the Yenuga Chettu (a tree resembling an elephant’s leg) to appease ‘Ammavaru’, who according to legend had decimated the buffalo-headed demon Mahishasura.

The second procession was taken out from the Narasimha Swamy temple to propitiate the goddess of wealth. Wearing masks, devotees competed with each other to offer prayers to the Mother Goddess in the flower-decked vehicle.

All Durga temples in the city, including the Rajarajeswari shrine at Lawyerpet, Saibaba temple, Durgadevi temple in Balajiraopeta, Mahishasuramardhini temple in Chennakesavapeta, Mahalakshmi temple near Kothapatnam bus stand and Rajarajeswari temple in Seetaramapuram, witnessed a flurry of religious activity. The Goddess was decorated as Durgadevi on the reverred Ashtami tithi on Saturday.

The city buzzed with activity as people in large numbers thronged markets for their festive shopping. Many shops and malls offered attractive discounts to woo buyers.

Ongole witnesses a spike in commercial activity during Dasara, as it is at this time that people buy many household goods as well as vehicles and electronic items, and use them after performing ‘Ayudha Pooja’. This year, however, sales took a hit of up to 70%due to COVID-19.

“There is a pent-up demand for FMCG items, and customers are slowly trickling in. Sales are not as good as last year but we are hoping to break even,” said a shopkeeper on the busy Kurnool Road who sells televisions, washing machines and microwave ovens.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/535fyo/article32938241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-VJ-ONGOLEDASARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ongole-soaks-in-festive-spirit-during-dasara-fete/article32938242.ece

In view of the flood situation at Prakasam Barrage, it has been decided to do away with the traditional ritual of taking the utsav vigrahams (processional deities) of goddess Durga and Lord Mallikarjuna Swamy for “nadi viharam”’ (celestial boat ride) on river Krishna as part of Teppotsavam that marks the conclusion of the Dasara festivities at Kanaka Durga temple atop Indrakeeladri hill.

The Teppotsavam is scheduled on Sunday. A meeting of the festival coordination committee, attended by Collector A. Md. Imtiaz, City Police Commissioner B. Venkateswarlu, temple Executive Officer Suresh Babu and others, held on Saturday took a decision to this effect.

Speaking to the media later, the Collector said that this year the Teppotsavam would be confined to offering pujas to the utsav idols of the deities placed on a Hamsa vahanam (a special boat built in the shape of a mythical Hamsa) but there would be no “nadi viharam” in view of floods in Krishna.

Only 21 persons, including eight pandits, two priests, a sub-inspector of police and others, will be allowed to participate in the puja and the punt used for Teppotsavam would be allowed only after assessing its capacity and verifying its fitness certificate.

Crowding of people on the Prakasam Barrage would not be allowed and as a precautionary measures, vehicular movement would be stopped on the newly-constructed Kanaka Durga flyover till the ritual was completed, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/67uizk/article32938216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25VJTEPPOTSAVAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/teppotsavam-no-nadi-viharam-due-to-floods-in-krishna/article32938217.ece

92,2020/10/25,Guntur gets its first gas-based crematorium,"The delay in conducting funeral rites of COVID victims has caused consternation among people and placed an enormous strain on the district administration. With the local community still wary of cremating the victims, the civic body had taken up the responsibility of conducting the funeral rites.

Now, thanks to a collective effort, a sum of ₹40 lakh has been raised and handed over to Mahaprastanam Seva Samithi, Stambalagaruvu. With this money, a gas-based crematorium was opened by Joint Collector A.S. Dinesh Kumar on Saturday. Narayana Rao, president of the samithi, social activist Koneru Srividya and members of governing body were present. Yet another crematorium is being opened by Amma Charitable Trust on Sunday.

It began with an initiative of a doctor couple, neurologist Rama Taraknath and his wife Srividya who after reading media reports about bodies being kept in morgue at the GGH for days, decided to pool in funds for building a gas-based crematorium. The couple donated ₹1 lakh and approached members of Guntur Neurosciences Society, fellow doctors , philanthropists and collected ₹11 lakh within just a week.

Mr. Dinesh Kumar said that this amount was given to Mahaprastanam Seva Samithi, who have been operating a gas-based crematorium and are now constructing another crematorium on the premises. He also said that another crematorium would come at Bongalabeedu and at Amma Trust ashram.

“We appreciate this noble initiative from the public and within a month, we will have a second crematorium. During this pandemic, a gas-based crematorium is the safest means and in full compliance with pollution norms. It is also economical when compared to traditional funeral rites,” said Mr. Dinesh Kumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/guntur-gets-its-first-gas-based-crematorium/article32938121.ece

In a positive reversal of festive trends, markets across the city witnessed brisk business on Saturday, the eve of Ayudha Puja. Vendors said the demand for flowers, ash gourd, and lime was high. This was even though the price of popular flowers had risen considerably — as much 25% — as supply had been affected by the recent spell of rain.

G.M. Diwakar, president, K.R. Market Flower Merchants’ Association, said, “Though we have done good business, more than what we expected, the prevailing rain has affected the supply and sales of flowers. Hence, due to the surge in demand, the rates increased.”

At K.R. Market for instance, ‘mallige moggu’ (jasmine) was selling at ₹800–₹1,000 a kg on Saturday, while ‘kanakambara’ (crossandra) was oscillating between ₹1,000 and ₹1,100. Vendors were selling ‘kakada’ at ₹600–₹650, and roses at ₹250–₹300 a kg. The fragrant ‘sugandaraja’ (tuberose) was being sold for around ₹400 and ‘sevantige’ (chrysanthemum) at ₹200–₹250 a kg.

“Most of the flowers come from the outskirts of the city such as Doddaballapur, Chickballapur, Ramanagaram, Gauribidanur, and the incessant rain has affected their quality,” said Mr. Diwakar, adding that ‘kakada’ and ‘mallige’ come from Tamil Nadu.

Venkatesh K., a flower vendor at K.R. Puram market, said that both flower growers and vendors were banking on sales ahead of Ayudha Puja and Vijayadashami. “From September 16 to October 16, business was dull. It is picking up and we hope to make some money till Deepavali,” he said.

At K.R. Puram market, there was great demand for garlands. A medium-sized ‘sevantige’ garland was selling at ₹150. “Compared to the quality of flower, the price is quite high,” a buyer said.

₹10-₹15 for lime

Items such as banana stems, limes, and ash gourds, which are an integral part of Ayudha Pooja, were of great demand. While the price of ash guord was oscillating between ₹40 and ₹60 a kg, a single piece of lime was retailing at ₹10 to ₹15, and a pair of banana stems was going for ₹20–₹35.

“A medium-sized ash gourd weighs around 4–5 kg and we have seen good business from morning. There will be demand till Sunday noon,” a vendor at K.R.

Shivakumar has issued an order constituting two committees to look after Chowdeshwari temple at Sigandur in Sagar taluk, which hit the headlines recently over differences between the trustees and priests of the temple.

The DC, in his order issued on Friday, said the monitoring committee would include the Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner of Sagar sub-division, a retired district judge, and an auditor. The advisory committee would include the Minister in charge of the district, MLA of Sagar, Lok Sabha member of Shivamogga, the trustee of Sigandur Chowdamma Devi Trust Ramappa, and the chief priest of the temple Sheshagiri Bhat.

The committees have been formed in the wake of recent controversies over the temple administration. Many organisations had appealed to the State government to bring the temple under the Muzrai Department, citing financial mismanagement in the administration. There were allegations that the trust had built many structures encroaching upon forest area. Recently, the differences between Mr. Ramappa and Mr. Bhat had attracted the attention of media.

The DC had visited the temple last week. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa too had held a meeting on the issue during his recent visit to Shivamogga.

The DC, in his order, said the site where Sigandur Chowdeshwari temple existed was part of Soppina Betta, within the wildlife forest area in Kargal range. Sigandur Chowdeshwari Trust had built a temple, lodge, dining hall, toilets, marriage hall, hotel, parking yard and commercial complexes by encroaching upon 20 acres of government land. The tahsildar of Sagar had ordered for the demolition of illegal structures on October 30, 2015, itself. The DC also noted irregularities in maintaining the records of valuables offered by the devotees.

Citing these issues, the DC said he had submitted a report to the State government. Referring to a high court order concerning a temple in Chikkamagaluru district, the DC has favoured Muzrai Department taking over the temple.

With over 2.08 lakh people recovering since October 1, Karnataka’s total recoveries breached the seven lakh mark on Saturday. With 7,153 patients getting discharged in the last 24 hours, the total recoveries touched 7,00737.

The number of recoveries outnumbered the number of new cases for the 10th consecutive day on Saturday.

Recoveries that crossed the one lakh mark on August 11 shot up considerably since then. A total of 4,46,111 people have beaten the infection from September 1 onwards and over 63.6% of the total recoveries have happened since September.

The recovery rate that was just about 50.73% till August 6, now stands at 87.7%. The national average is 89.8% as on Saturday. Recovery rate in at least 21 districts in the State is higher than the national average.

Recovery rate

The State’s recovery rate rose after the State tweaked its discharge policy in August. While in the initial months, patients were being discharged only after two negative reports within 48 hours, the State changed its policy that allowed a patient’s discharge after 10 days if he/she does not have any symptoms for three consecutive days before discharge.

Meanwhile continuing the declining trend, the State on Saturday saw a further dip in cases with 4,471 new cases. It was on August 3 last when the number of new cases were 4,752. The test positivity rate (TPR) for the day reduced to 3.97%, which is a good sign.

While the total number of cases touched 7,98,378, the toll rose to 10,873 with 52 new deaths. This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths. While 15 districts reported zero deaths, only two districts reported more than five deaths on Saturday. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for the day stood at 1.16%.

The number of active cases too reduced in the last few days and as on Saturday, active cases came down to 86,749. Of these, 935 patients are being monitored in the ICUs.

Bengaluru Urban reported 2,251 cases taking the tally to 3,23,305. With 26 of the 52 deaths from Bengaluru, the toll in this district rose to 3,714. Active cases in Bengaluru reduced to 55,983.

As many as 1,12.545 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, including 90,564 rapid antigen tests. With this the total number of tests rose to 72,81,0990.

Why decline?

Attributing the decline in numbers to higher testing, Munish Moudgil, who heads the State COVID-19 War Room, said the State was in the third phase of linear growth since July wherein roughly a fixed number of cases add daily.

“COVID-19 seems to follow three phases of growth followed by 4th phase of reduction. In the initial phase of exponential growth the cases double every fixed days. In the second phase of polynomial growth cases grow slower than exponential but more than linear. The third phase of linear growth sees roughly a fixed number of cases adding daily. For many days since July we were in the third phase,” he explained.

“Now, the third phase is followed by the fourth phase of reduction provided adequate testing is done and other measures are in place. Due to diligent and ramped up testing and control on other parameters affecting COVID-19, we are seeing a reduction in cases,” he said.

“The cases will reduce and stabilise at a daily lower number provided testing remains the same and citizens continue to observe SMS - sanitisation, masking and social distancing,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3idnfi/article32938252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HinduTemplateLibrarystates1bcART10000IMG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/recoveries-breach-7-lakh-mark-in-state/article32938253.ece
100,2020/10/25,COVID-19: Experts warn of surge in cases post festival if ‘SMS’ isn’t followed,"Social gatherings and visits to native villages should be strictly avoided, say doctors

Karnataka is likely to witness another surge in COVID-19 cases in the first half of November, if people do not follow the standard guidelines of SMS (social distancing, masking and santisation) during the festival season, warn experts.

Citing Kerala’s surge that happened post Onam, members of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee said social gatherings and visits to native villages for festivals should be strictly avoided.

Carrying back and forth

“People should avoid going out of the city to villages for the festivals, which they usually do. They should realise that they can either carry the infection there or bring it back with them on return,” said C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force.

“With the festival season beginning in the State, this week and coming week are crucial. The ongoing Dasara festivities followed by Eid Milad, Valmiki Jayanthi and Kannada Rajyotsava in the coming week can become potential sources of another surge if people become complacent now,” he said.

Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare), said the entire effort of the State in controlling the pandemic could go waste if people do not follow precautions now. “We have been able to see a decline in the number of cases now with great difficulty. The onus is on people now to ensure that the numbers do not go up again,” he said.

V. Ravi, Senior Professor and head of the department of Neuro Virology at NIMHANS, who is also part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said going by what happened in Kerala post Onam, the State is likely to experience a second surge in the first half of November.

“People should realise that the virus is still lurking around and that the spread can be prevented if people behave responsibly,” he said. Stating that even those who have recovered should be careful, Dr. Ravi said, “There are increasing reports of reinfection among those who have recovered. Some people either do not develop antibodies or the antibodies do not last for long. So people who have been infected and did not develop an appropriate immune response have a risk of reinfection.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/r9r6cv/article32938249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGPUMPKIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-experts-warn-of-surge-in-cases-post-festival-if-sms-isnt-followed/article32938250.ece
101,2020/10/25,Legislative Council polls: Why did JD(S) suddenly withdraw candidate?,"Contradictory statements from the party president, local leaders and the candidate himself regarding the Janata Dal (S) decision to withdraw from the contest in the Legislative Council election to Karnataka West Graduates constituency and support an Independent candidate has given room for speculation on what transpired behind the scenes.

The sudden announcement, days before the polling on October 28, about the party supporting Independent candidate Basavaraj Gurikar and the different versions of the events from leaders have led to confusion and discontent among party loyalists.

In its official statement, the JD(S) on Wednesday said it was extending support to Mr. Gurikar as their official candidate Shivashankar Kallur had become “neutral” and had not been campaigning. But a different version emerged on Friday, when senior leader and former Minister Basavaraj Horatti told presspersons that because of family issues, the candidate had been “unable to campaign extensively” and reach out to the electorate, forcing the party to take such a decision. The party had announced Mr. Kallur as candidate a year ago, and interestingly, he had claimed that he had got several thousands of voters enrolled.

Mr. Kallur, who did not speak much at the press conference, apparently broke down during a party meeting held later. “Winning or losing is a different matter. But I never thought of withdrawing from the contest. I have been working for a year. However, as the party leaders have decided to support the Independent candidate, I have decided to withdraw,” he said at the meeting, according to others who attended.

Mr. Kallur is from Annigeri, part of Navalgund Assembly constituency, which was represented by JD(S) national general secretary N.H. Konaraddi in the previous Assembly. Mr. Konaraddi told The Hindu that he was not part of the decision-making process and the party high command had taken the decision after consulting leaders from the constituency.

Considering the diminishing party base in the four districts, a few leaders of the party are believed to have suggested that the JD(S) not field candidates for the Council poll. This view, however, was not considered earlier. But after checking the ground situation in the last couple of days, the leadership felt otherwise and the decision was taken to avoid “possible embarrassment” in case the candidate failed to garner a respectable number of votes, sources said.

Following the decision, several JD(S) workers were found campaigning for Mr. Gurikar on Saturday, but those disappointed stayed away. While political observers said that such a decision from the JD(S) was not a new phenomenon and there are various precedents, it seems to have dented the party’s image in the region.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/legislative-council-polls-why-did-jds-suddenly-withdraw-candidate/article32938078.ece
102,2020/10/25,Karnataka bypolls: CM to hit campaign trail only on last three days,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has so far been conspicuous by his absence from the BJP byelection campaign in the State. Party sources say he will join on the last three days of the campaign and hold road shows in both Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar, which are headed for polls on November 3.

“He will have a limited role in the campaign,” said a close aide of the Chief Minister.

This is in contrast to the campaign in 15 constituencies that saw bypolls in December 2019, when Mr. Yediyurappa led from the front. “The survival of the government was in question then and winning over 10 seats was critical to his continuing as Chief Minister. That is not the case here. He need not slog like he did then,” a senior party functionary said.

Sources close to Mr. Yediyurappa also said he has been unhappy with party affairs and how a considerable section within the party, including senior office-bearers, have been “plotting for his removal”. “He is trying to send the message that he is unhappy,” a close associate said.

Vijayendra factor

However, Mr. Yediyurappa is particularly keen on a party victory in Sira. “His son B.Y. Vijayendra has been working in Sira and they want to build a narrative based on Mr. Vijayendra’s election management skills, like in K.R. Pet, especially given that it is not a Lingayat-dominated seat,” a source said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-bypolls-cm-to-hit-campaign-trail-only-on-last-three-days/article32938065.ece
103,2020/10/25,Will Bihar poll results have an impact on Karnataka politics?,"With speculation rife within the ranks of the ruling BJP that the party’s high command will effect a leadership change in the State after the Bihar Assembly elections, all eyes are now on that State. The outcome of the polls may decide the mood of the high command on the issue, BJP leaders predict.

Silence on Yatnal

The fact that the party chief in Karnataka has not even issued a notice to senior MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who said that B.S. Yediyurappa would not last long as Chief Minister, indicates the high command’s intent, sources said. However, the manner in which the Bihar electoral arena will pan out may have a bearing on the high command’s final call, they added.

“Before the campaign began, it was assumed that the National Democratic Alliance would have a cakewalk. But now there are several signals from the campaign trail — crowds thronging Rashtriya Janata Dal rallies and Nitish Kumar being booed at a rally — that the contest has opened up,” a BJP leader said. He argued that if the NDA lost in Bihar, then the scales would likely tilt in favour of strong regional satraps within the BJP, which might give Mr. Yediyurappa another chance at survival.

It can be recalled that Mr. Yediyurappa was anointed president of the BJP State unit in 2016, paving the way for him to eventually head the government, close on the heels of the BJP’s defeat in the Delhi and Bihar Assembly polls of 2015 — the first major defeats the party had suffered since it came to power in 2014. “In both Delhi and Bihar, the BJP had led the campaign with the face of Narendra Modi and not a strong regional leader. Within the party forum, that was later analysed as one of the reasons for defeat. This helped Mr. Yediyurappa project himself as a regional satrap,” a leader close to the Chief Minister said.

Two factions

While the faction arguing for a leadership change has been pointing out Mr. Yediyurappa’s age and his inability to lead the next Assembly polls would create a leadership vacuum, the Chief Minister’s faction has been pushing the narrative that there is no alternative leader in the party ranks who can rival his mass base and ability to deliver an election.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/will-bihar-poll-results-have-an-impact-on-karnataka-politics/article32937986.ece
104,2020/10/25,People in Sira are aspiring for change as they want development: Rajesh Gowda,"Forty-six-year-old C.M. Rajesh Gowda, who is taking the plunge into politics as BJP candidate in the byelection to Sira Assembly constituency, says the development of this backward constituency is his main poll agenda. The medical practitioner says he has readied a blueprint for development, which will be implemented by the government headed by his party.

Excerpts from The Hindu’s interview with him:

You were a medical practitioner. What brought you to politics?

My father was three-time MP and even my uncle was in politics. However, as a postgraduate in radiology, I focused on the medical field. But my service of patients endeared me to people, who encouraged me to enter public life. Of course, my entry into politics is not sudden as I have engaged in social service, including the refurbishing of government hospitals, strengthening infrastructure in government schools, and providing safe drinking water, for about four years.

Your father was an MP from the Congress. Why did you choose the BJP?

I have been influenced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a long time. The BJP was a natural choice for ideological reasons.

But there was resistance to your candidature from within the BJP local unit?

There was some resistance in the beginning as two other leaders were trying to get ticket. But after the party’s top leadership chose me, they are all supporting and campaigning for me.

What are the main poll issues in Sira?

Development is the main agenda. This constituency is underdeveloped though it is represented by senior leaders. It needs focus on development of infrastructure such as roads and drinking water. Also, there is a dire need to create irrigation facilities in this parched constituency.

What is your plan for the development of the constituency?

I have prepared a blueprint for comprehensive development. This includes laying roads, providing drinking water and filling up Madaluru tank with Hemavati waters. This will also help increase the groundwater table. I want to focus on industrial development as well, so that youngsters find employment. I can get them implemented through our government in the State.

You are taking on a veteran leader such as T.B. Jayachandra from the Congress and the wife of a prominent grassroots leader like Sathyanarayana from the JD(S). Also, the BJP is yet to register any poll victory here so far. Is it not a tough battle?

No. My initial campaign tour has shown that people here are aspiring for a change as they want development. Since the BJP is in power at both the Centre and the State, development can be achieved only through this party.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dmagvj/article32937982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGRAJESHGOWDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/people-in-sira-are-aspiring-for-change-as-they-want-development-rajesh-gowda/article32937983.ece
105,2020/10/25,Study in Bagalkot exposes lacunae in public healthcare system,"A study of the public health infrastructure in Bagalkot district has highlighted some of the perennial issues that district and taluk hospitals face — non-availability of laboratory tests and diagnostic services, besides poor maintenance of equipment and hospital premises.

Major lab tests such as endoscopy, CT scan, and MRI were not even conducted in the district hospital, according to the study, conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru. Out of the six taluk hospitals that were taken up for the study, only three had ultrasound test facility, and none of them conducted biochemistry tests. Tests such as CBC (complete blood count) and serum bilirubin were not conducted in any of the rural health facilities. The study team, led by ISEC professor C.M. Lakshmana, found that patients were compelled to approach private hospitals, at their own cost, for tests not conducted at the healthcare centres.

Falling into disuse

The study, sponsored by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, noted that the health staff were not trained in proper use and operation of equipment, and the machinery was not properly maintained. No health worker was assigned the responsibility of maintaining the equipment and many health centres did not even have space for it. “Over a period of time, these issues together may render the health and laboratory equipment useless,” the team’s report stated. The equipment was either partially out of order or completely unusable, Dr. Lakshmana said.

The study covered 29 health institutions of Bagalkot district, including healthcare centres in six taluks, five community health centres, six primary health centres, and 11 sub-centres. The findings were based on personal visits to these institutions by a team and focus group discussions with the staff and patients. The district hospital alone provided services to over 10,000 patients a month.

Some positives

On a positive note, many staff members acknowledged the adequate availability of drugs and medicines. The computerised drug inventory system was working well and was said to be enhancing the efficiency of drug supply and distribution. However, interruptions in supply of power and untrained computer operators were two major impediments to drug inventory digitalisation, the report stated.

As a result, patients were left to purchase such drugs from private sources. Items such as sanitary napkins were not available at many centres, and space problems when it came to storing drugs was also noticed at several facilities.

Dr. Lakshmana said in the district as a whole, the team observed poor maintenance of hospital as well as residential buildings. Almost all the buildings were facing paucity of electricity and water. Non-availability of water in sufficient quantity, coupled with the shortage of Group-D employees, was the reason offered by the health staff for not maintaining cleanliness.

The gap between sanctioned posts and filled posts was highest in the case of medical officers at all the healthcare centres. In the district hospital, only 20 medical officers were working, as against the sanctioned number of 40. The shortage of medical staff was severe in taluk hospitals as well.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ddwfhd/article32937954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGHEALTHCENTRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/study-in-bagalkot-exposes-lacunae-in-public-healthcare-system/article32937956.ece
106,2020/10/25,Policeman earns praise for helping orphaned sisters,"FB video moves ASI of H.D. Kote taluk to support them

An Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police (ASI) has earned the admiration of residents of Shiramahalli village in H.D. Kote taluk after he turned guardian angel to two orphaned sisters.

The sisters — the elder one, aged around 16, had passed SSLC, while the younger one was around 14 years and had passed Class VIII — were living in abject poverty in their dilapidated house in the village after they lost both their parents about eight years ago. Their grandmother, who was taking care of them, too died a couple of years ago.

Their survival depended on the mercy of the villagers, who were giving them food. But, the situation took a turn for the worse during the pandemic.

Shivalinga Kabini, a local lensman, shot a video and posted it on his Facebook account with an appeal to help the siblings.

When ASI Doreswamy came across the video about five months ago, he immediately visited the sisters’ house.

“I was moved by their pitiable condition. There was no electricity in the house. There were no beds or mattresses. There was no toilet. There was no food in the house,” Mr. Doreswamy told The Hindu.

He immediately arranged for rations and groceries. His wife Chandrika joined him in taking the girls to H.D. Kote town in his car to purchase clothes and other utensils for them.

College admission

He has also facilitated the elder girl’s admission to the PUC College in H.D. Kote town while the younger one will continue with her high school education in the same village.

Mr. Doreswamy also got their dilapidated house reconstructed with a new compound wall and concrete reinforcements. He spent ₹3 lakh from his own pocket.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/policeman-earns-praise-for-helping-orphaned-sisters/article32937799.ece

109,2020/10/25,KTU orders probe into question paper leak,"Students banked on COVID-19 to keep invigilators at distance

Students of five engineering colleges in Kerala were found to have smuggled in mobile phones into the exam hall and shared the question papers of an engineering examination on Friday.

The question papers of the third semester supplementary examination on ‘Linear Algebra and Complex Analysis’ were circulated by the students. As photos of the papers found their way to WhatsApp groups, answers were soon posted in response.

The APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) has decided to cancel the examination and order an enquiry into the malpractice.

According to official sources, the students caught indulging in the malpractice apparently sought to capitalise on the fear of novel coronavirus infection and banked on invigilators not coming close enough to detect the use of mobile phones. However, the vigilant teachers sensed something amiss and seized the mobile phones and other evidence from the students.

Based on a preliminary report submitted by the Controller of Examination K.R. Kiron, the examination sub-committee of the Syndicate chaired by Pro-Vice Chancellor S. Ayoob decided to cancel the examination and order a fresh one at the earliest.

KTU Vice Chancellor M.S. Rajasree ordered the principals of the affiliated colleges to conduct a detailed probe into the incident. The university is expected to lodge a formal complaint with the Police Cyber Cell on the basis of the investigations that could also ascertain any possible role of any external sources in supplying the answers to the students.

116,2020/10/25,No COVID-19 deaths at RGGGH in 24 hours,"The number of daily deaths has come down slowly because of a multi-disciplinary approach: Dean

For the first time in several months, the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), the largest government tertiary care hospital in Tamil Nadu, recorded no deaths due to COVID-19 for 24 hours.

Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan told reporters that deaths due to COVID-19 among patients admitted to the government medical college hospitals as well as institutions under the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services were reducing. “There was not a single death at RGGGH on Friday,” he said.

RGGGH Dean E. Theranirajan said the hospital recorded no deaths among COVID-19 patients from 8 a.m. on October 23 to 8 a.m. on October 24.

He added that the number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 had come down slowly at the hospital because of a multi-disciplinary approach.

This was the first time in many months that the hospital, which has treated a high number of COVID-19 patients since March, is reporting zero deaths.

Managing the patients

“We framed uniform protocols for management of COVID-19 patients based on three categories of the disease: mild, moderate and severe. We established zero delay in initiating care. Chest physicians, anaesthetists, internal medicine and allied specialists such as from neurology, cardiology and nephrology were designated as treatment coordinators, with separate teams working under them,” he said.

Separate teams were formed to manage patients with diabetes and renal disease. They monitored blood sugar levels, titration of insulin and treatment, he said.

“We reviewed the deaths on a daily basis. This helped us to scrutinise the main causes of death among COVID-19 patients and take measures to prevent deaths. For instance, we noticed that dyselectrolytemia — imbalances in the electrolyte — in elderly patients. To address this, we involved the nephrology team and came up with a treatment protocol. Similarly, we have come up with treatment guidelines for patients with hypertension and COVID-19, coronary artery disease and COVID-19, and for those diagnosed with new onset diabetes,” he said.

Noting that COVID-19 cases had declined by 50%, the Health Secretary said, “For nearly a month-and-a half, the State was reporting COVID-19 cases in the range of 5,000 to 6,000 a day. This has slowly decreased. Now, on average, we are testing 80,000 samples, of which nearly 3,000 persons are testing positive.”

He said complaints were being received about private laboratories charging in excess for tests, and action would be taken if laboratories did not adhere to the fee fixed by the government.

On 7.5% reservation

Asked whether the Governor seeking time to decide on the 7.5% horizontal reservation for NEET-qualified government school students would affect medical admission counselling, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the Central government conducted counselling for the all-India quota seats separately.

“As far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, we will come up with the prospectus for MBBS after the decision,” he said.

117,2020/10/25,A time to ramp up defences and stay prepared,"Health Secretary warns against complacency at this stage

If the West is apprehensive of the approaching winter and flu season in view of a second wave of COVID-19, here, it is the case of the impending festival season that has authorities anxious about super-spreader events and rising cases.

As the number of COVID-19 cases has shown a declining trend in the recent weeks, the Health Secretary has written to district officials, cautioning them against complacency during this crucial phase. Pointing to a resurgence in cases in Europe, J. Radhakrishnan urged officials not to let their guard down as the battle, ostensibly, still rages on.

A lower number of cases has been registered after conducting around 80,000 RT-PCR tests a day in the State, with the daily count staying around 3,000. And as far as the capital is concerned, the numbers have consistently remained under the 1,000-mark. For a project that has been on mission mode for nearly seven months, chances that the guard in the fight against COVID-19 has been lowered, as a result of fatigue or a belief that the worst is over, are high. It is necessary that leaders of the campaign are aware of this possibility and ensure that there is no let-up in the efforts. Dr. Radhakrishnan’s note could not have come at a better time, public health experts say.

In his letter to District Collectors and health officials, the Health Secretary stressed the need for tracking the case fatality rate and positivity rate; linking fever camps based on need, hospital occupancy and the absolute number of fresh cases, and continuing with the high number of tests.

He also emphasised the need for people to continue following protocols, including wearing of masks, hand hygiene and distancing.

Former Corporation health officer P. Kuganantham said the attention paid to senior citizens needed to be ramped up because this was key to achieving a low fatality rate. “Data shows that 96%-97% deaths are among senior citizens and people with co-morbidities. We need to ensure that the elderly continue to follow protocols in order to be shielded from possible infection among any other member in the family,” he said.

Prabhdeep Kaur, Deputy Director, Indian Council of Medical Research - National Institute of Epidemiology, expressed concerns about a fall in mask compliance.

She stressed the need to continue adhering to protocols, especially mask wearing and maintenance of distancing. Crowd control, especially during the festival season, is very important, she added. Surveillance must be enhanced in markets and commercial areas to ensure that crowds do not gather and set off other clusters, she said.

The note to district officials also laid emphasis on monitoring market places to ensure masking as they can turn into super spreaders. The Health Secretary also suggested the setting up of information kiosks at places frequented by people during the festival season to prevent a spike in infections.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7oue6v/article32938685.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-Declining-trendcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a-time-to-ramp-up-defences-and-stay-prepared/article32938686.ece

119,2020/10/25,Ramadoss lauds A.P. CM for setting up BC corporations,"PMK founder writes to Y.S.R. Jaganmohan Reddy

PMK founder S. Ramadoss has written to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S.R. Jaganmohan Reddy, congratulating him for the State government’s announcement on establishing 56 Backward Class Corporations and the list of chairpersons to head these corporations.

“I have learnt that 29 corporations are going to be led by women (more than 50%) and 12 directors have been appointed for each corporation representing all 13 districts. I appreciate the fact that you have taken this right decision, at the right time, to uphold social justice and ensure social development,” he said in the letter.

Mr. Ramadoss further pointed out that Mr. Reddy has seen caste as the foundation of social justice, and as an indicator of State’s development, at the time when caste is seen as a symbol of regressiveness in the cultural setting of pseudo political decency and in the name of progressive thinking.

“This is called true revolution. Through this you have risen as the ‘Guardian of Social Justice’ in the State of Andhra Pradesh. I am very proud & happy to confer the title of Andhra Pradesh’s Guardian of Social Justice on you.”

Mr. Ramadoss also hailed the announcement that the Andhra Pradesh government would provide funding to the corporations and other measures and noted that this will not only lead to the advancement of individuals, including women from every community but also will pave the way for the growth and progress of society as a whole; it is sure that there will be overall development of the State.

“The policy decision that you have taken to make Andhra Pradesh an alcohol-free State by 2024 is highly commendable.

123,2020/10/25,HC dismisses son’s plea against payment of maintenance to mother,"The Madras High Court has dismissed a case filed by a person challenging two consecutive orders passed by courts directing him to pay maintenance of ₹5,000 a month to his aged mother under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

Justice P.N. Prakash said he did not find any manifest illegality in the order passed by a judicial magistrate court in Salem in 2012 and confirmed by a sessions court in 2014 while dismissing a revision petition preferred by the man under Section 397 of the CrPC. The judge pointed out that an order by a judicial or metropolitan magistrate for payment of monthly maintenance to parents, wife or children could be challenged by way of a criminal revision petition either before a High Court or a sessions court.

After the petitioner moves a revision application before the High Court or the sessions court, no further application by the same person could be entertained by either of the courts. There was a specific bar on it under Section 397(3) of CrPC.

In an attempt to overcome such a bar, the present petitioner preferred an application before the High Court under Section 482 of the CrPC (inherent power of the High Court to prevent abuse of process of any court or to secure the ends of justice).

Holding the course adopted by the petitioner as not maintainable, Justice Prakash said petitions under Section 482 could be entertained by the High Court only if there was a manifest illegality in the orders passed by the courts below. “In the present case, this court does not find any such illegality. The mother-son relationship is not disputed. Only the quantum of maintenance is challenged. This is a question of fact, which has been gone into by the two courts below,” the judge said, and dismissed the case.

Until September 24, 2001, Section 397 of Cr.P.C. authorised magistrates to order maintenance to a maximum of ₹500 a month. However, after the 2001 amendment, they were empowered to fix the quantum as they deemed fit according to the facts and circumstances of each case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-dismisses-sons-plea-against-payment-of-maintenance-to-mother/article32938333.ece
124,2020/10/25,Ready to take battle to court: VCK chief,"Stalin, other Oppn. leaders demand withdrawal of case against Thirumavalavan

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) leader and Chidambaram MP Thol. Thirumavalavan on Saturday said he was ready to take the battle to the court to decide whether it was his party or the Hindu religious text, Manusmriti, which was demeaning women.

He alleged that his remarks had been twisted and this was done intentionally to break the DMK-led alliance and gain political mileage.

“I spoke for 40 minutes at the web-based conference organised last month by the European Union Periyar Ambedkar Comrades’ Federation. Only 40 seconds of that speech has been taken and twisted by communal forces. I request women to listen to the entire speech. It has been nearly a month since I gave the speech and a controversy has been stirred up now,” he told reporters, after leading the party’s protest at Valluvar Kottam here, demanding a ban on Manusmriti.

The fight against Manusmriti was started by Periyar, M.C. Rajah and Dr. Ambedkar, and the VCK is taking it forward, he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan said the AIADMK government had directed the police to book a case against him just to please the BJP government at the Centre. “The BJP has no right to celebrate Dr. Ambedkar. I thank leaders of all our alliance parties for voicing their support for me,” he added.

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday asserted that communal forces would not succeed in driving a wedge into the DMK-led alliance by targeting Mr. Thirumavalavan for his comments against Manusmriti.

In a statement in Chennai, he demanded the withdrawal of the case against Mr. Thirumavalavan, saying that he had expressed only what was preached by Dr. Ambedkar and Periyar E.V. Ramasamy. The Cyber Crime Wing had booked a case against him for his comments against the Manusmriti.

‘Vengeance of police’

“A case has been filed under six sections and it shows the vengeance and partial approach of the police under the control of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami,” he said. “Mr. Thirumavalavan has only reiterated the ideas propagated by Dr. Ambedkar and Periyar. He cited Manu Dharma to explain how women were denied their rights in the country,” Mr. Stalin said.

He said communal forces had posted a distorted version of Mr. Thirumavalavan’s speech. “Instead of taking action against the communal forces that are keen on inciting violence, the police have filed a case against Mr. Thirumavalavan,” he said.

The MDMK and the CPI(M) State unit too, on Saturday, urged the police to withdraw the case booked against Mr. Thirumavalavan.

Talking about the issue, former Union Minister P. Chidambaram questioned how Mr. Thirumavalavan could be booked in a criminal case for his statements on the Manusmriti. “There can be two opinions on a speech, whether it is right or wrong. How can it become a criminal case? Should we keep reminding that there is freedom of speech, on a daily basis?” Mr. Chidambaram tweeted. He wondered if rationalist leader Periyar E V Ramasamy, who too held similar views that Mr Thirumavalavan spoke about, would be booked by the police if he had made such comments now?

CPI(M) politburo member G. Ramakrishnan contended that Manusmriti had a lot of aspects that demeaned women, the Backward Castes and indigenous groups, and urged the police to withdraw the case. He also said the State police, of late, had been acting under the instructions of the Sangh Parivar, and was not abiding by the legal framework.

“The police have ignored complaints against those who have made insulting comments against working women as well as women journalists and have not come forward to take action,” Mr. Ramakrishnan said.

MDMK general secretary Vaiko said Mr. Thirumavalavan had high regard for women and had pointed out the demeaning ways in which Manusmriti talked about women. The Sangh Parivar has twisted facts and filed a complaint against him, he said, condemning the filing of the case. MMK president M.H. Jawahirullah also called for withdrawal of the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/77lo6l/article32938330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THTHIRU2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ready-to-take-battle-to-court-vck-chief/article32938331.ece
125,2020/10/25,Coronavirus | CRPF develops reusable protective suit for COVID-19 warriors,"It is the fruit of the research of RAF Chief Commandant Erick Gilbert Jose

The 97th Battalion Rapid Action Force (RAF) of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Avadi, has developed a reusable microbial preventive suit that can be used by frontline workers engaged in COVID-19 prevention duties.

The pandemic has led to an increase in the manufacture of personal protective equipment (PPE). A PPE kit, used once, needs to be disposed of so that the virus does not spread. The microbial preventive suit is an advanced version of the PPE.

“Our main intention is to protect our own troops doing COVID-19 duties. Now that health workers, police personnel and other frontline workers are affected by the novel coronavirus, we feel it is our duty to extend this service to them,” RAF Chief Commandant Erick Gilbert Jose said.

The reusable suit is a brainchild of Mr. Jose, who led his troops in counter- terror operations at sub-zero temperatures in Jammu and Kashmir. The men under him were clad with three inners, uniforms, jackets and parka coats while walking in four-five feet of snow. Realising the difficulties faced by them, Mr. Jose started research to develop a new vest that can stop the chill, while being comfortable and light.

Even after he was shifted to Chennai, he continued the research. The RAF is being deployed in many places to enforce the lockdown and to assist the police and health workers.

“We purchased PPE kits from the market and found that they were made of non-woven fabric, which does not stop water. If water can penetrate, viruses can also penetrate. I visualised a microbial protective suit that can prevent any virus and water leak. Later, we developed the suit and tested it on 30 people in each company,” Mr. Jose said.

The materials were presented to the Tamil Nadu Health Department, and the suit was approved by the South India Textile Research Association.

The suit is made of three pieces — one is the shoe cover which extends up to the knee, the other is the upper portion and the third is a trouser. The normal PPE is made of non-woven fabric, which is uncomfortable to wear. But the microbial preventive suit is made of high quality woven cloth, and contains no cotton to ensure the suit is not heavy. “It can be easily sanitised with soap water... so that the novel coronavirus is destroyed immediately,” the officer said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1rpelp/article32938269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25REUSABLESUIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/crpf-develops-reusable-protective-suit-for-covid-warriors/article32938270.ece
126,2020/10/25,T.N. to roll out house site allocation scheme for encroachers in December,"4.09 lakh encroachment sites have been identified

The Tamil Nadu government is set to roll out in December a scheme for purchasing private patta land and assigning it as house sites to several thousands of families living on encroached land.

A total of 4,09,676 housing encroachments have been identified and classified into six categories — Unobjectionable and regularisable at the district level; regularisable with the consent of a local body; regularisable after reclassification with special orders of the government; temple land (temple poromboke and land where the patta is in the name of the temple) intended to be purchased by the government subject to the decisions on writ petitions; objectionable poromboke land other than water courses; and objectionable water course poromboke land.

As many as 1,91,991 such objectionable encroachments have been identified on temple land, water courses and other land across the State.

In a note sent out earlier this month, Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam directed the Collectors to give priority to the regularisation of the first three categories by November since the scheme would be launched by the Chief Minister in the first week of December. A week after, a patta distribution mela would be organised by the district administration at the grassroots. The encroachments in the corporation areas would be dealt with separately as the regularisation proposal had to be examined on a case-by-case basis by the State Committee.

Special scheme

The government announced the special scheme to ensure housing sites for all families living on the encroached poromboke land for many years by regularising the sites on unobjectionable land. Families living in objectionable poromboke land would be relocated to alternative places while clearing the encroachments and restoring the land for its original purpose.

As for the encroachments on temple poromboke land, work would start to earmark sub-divisions and arriving at the land cost as per the government norms. Subject to the outcome of the writ petitions, further instructions will be issued for purchase, reclassification and distribution of patta.

The Chief Secretary said, “Existing suitable unobjectionable porombokes may be identified in the vicinity for the purpose of resettlement.

The Collectors were told to identify such suitable patta land, assess the cost and send separate proposals to the government through the Commissioner of Land Administration for allotment of money for buying the land through private negotiations.

127,2020/10/25,"Opposition’s role is not to remain silent, says Stalin","DMK chief leads demonstration to press Governor to give nod to 7.5% quota Bill

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday said if his party’s efforts to get 7.5% reservation for NEET-qualified State government school students in medical college admissions was seen as a political game, it would wholeheartedly accept the charge of politicisation.

Addressing a demonstration organised by the DMK to press Governor Banwarilal Purohit to grant assent to the Bill seeking to implement the 7.5% reservation, Mr. Stalin said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami might accuse the DMK of playing politics as he did not understand the issue.

“The Opposition will play politics [arasiyal] and not prepare aviyal [a dish],” he said. Reiterating that the DMK would not rest until the Governor gave his nod to the Bill, he said Mr. Palaniswami, “who crawled to get the Chief Minister’s post”, could plead with the Governor for his consent.

“We do not expect the Chief Minister to crawl before the Governor. What is the justification for occupying the Chief Minister’s seat when you are not able to request the Governor for his assent?” Mr. Stalin asked.

In a statement later, he said if the Chief Minister was keen on proving his efficiency, he should get the Governor’s assent for the Bill.

Pointing out that 40 days had passed since the Bill was sent to the Governor for his assent, Mr. Stalin wondered what the need was for the Governor to take into account the legal aspects since the reservation was recommended by a retired judge, Justice Kalaiyarasan.

“If the Bill gets his assent, around 300 government school students can get entry into medical colleges. Otherwise, only eight will get seats. How can we remain silent in the face of such injustice?” he asked.

He wanted to know what the need was for the Governor to delay his assent since he had travelled across the State and earned a name for his active approach. “He would have probably thought the AIADMK government will not question him. But the DMK will,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/eg9hv5/article32938191.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-24-at-84122-PM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/oppositions-role-is-not-to-remain-silent-says-stalin/article32938193.ece
128,2020/10/25,HC rejects woman’s plea to quash domestic violence case,"Asks her to appear before domestic violence cases court in Coimbatore on November 9

The Madras High Court has rejected the plea of an aged woman to quash a domestic violence case filed by her daughter-in-law with allegations that she was driven away from her matrimonial home in Chennai and was forced to live with her sister in Coimbatore.

Justice P.N. Prakash rejected the argument that the mother-in-law had no role in the marital affairs between the couple and that she had been unnecessarily dragged into the litigation.

The judge held there were prima facie materials and hence the case could not be quashed.

Complainant’s claim

He said the complainant had claimed to have spent nearly ₹3 lakh for treating the petitioner after the latter suffered a fracture on her leg and that the money was not returned to her.

The complainant had also accused the petitioner of taking away her jewels.

Hence, the judge refrained from quashing the case at the threshold but allowed the petitioner, considering her age and the long distance that she had to travel, from appearing in person before the trial court during every other hearing of the case.

‘Execute bond’

He directed the quash petitioner to appear before a special court for domestic violence cases in Coimbatore on November 9, execute a personal bond for ₹10,000 under Section 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and undertake to appear as and when necessary.

Thereafter, her personal presence during the regular hearings of the case could be dispensed with if she engaged an advocate with a special vakalat (an authorisation given to advocates to represent their clients), the judge ordered. ‘

He further directed the petitioner to file an affidavit stating that she would not dispute her identity and that her counsel would cross examine the witnesses, in her absence, without adopting any dilatory tactics.

The judge also ordered the petitioner to appear before the trial court whenever it required her presence in the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-rejects-womans-plea-to-quash-domestic-violence-case/article32938027.ece

133,2020/10/25,Improve economy instead of toppling governments: Uddhav Thackeray tells BJP,"“Rather than working on improving economy, steps are taken to topple governments. We are heading towards anarchy,” the Maharashtra Chief Minister said.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on October 25 said there would be anarchy in the country if the BJP remained interested only in toppling governments rather than improving the nation’s economy.

Addressing the Shiv Sena’s annual Dussehra rally, Mr. Thackeray dared the BJP to topple his government and also asked it to first protect its government at the Centre.

“Instead of the ‘no alternative’ factor as was the case earlier, people have now started thinking that anyone will do except you,” Mr. Thackeray said, without naming Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“Rather than working on improving economy, steps are taken to topple governments. We are heading towards anarchy,” he said, adding the Sena was not greedy for power.

“Though the country is facing a pandemic, how can one indulge in politics? Shiv Sena’s Hindutva is being questioned. Maharashtra government and Mumbai Police are being maligned,” he said.

Citing RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speech in Nagpur earlier in the day, Mr. Thackeray said, “The RSS chief said Hindutva has been narrowed down to only observing puja rituals.”

“Those who wear black cap like him should understand this if they have brains,” Mr. Thackeray said, in a veiled attack on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on his remarks over Hindutva while asking for reopening places of religious worship. “I have no happiness in shutting down places. Lifting of restrictions is being done cautiously and gradually,” he said.

Mr. Thackeray said Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had once called for a “Sangh-mukt Bharat” and had also sought a secular face in 2014 as the BJP’s PM candidate.

“Has Nitish donned Hindutva robes or has BJP become secular now,” Mr. Thackeray said.

He also hit out at Kangana Ranaut over her equating Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). “People who have no means of livelihood in their home come to Mumbai and betray it. Calling Mumbai as PoK is in fact the failure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had said he would get back PoK into India,” Mr. Thackeray said.

He said Maharashtra-haters had left no stone unturned to defame the State.

The Sena’s annual Dussehra rally was held at the Savarkar hall in Dadar due to coronavirus norms instead of the usual venue, the sprawling Shivaji Park, also in Dadar area.

“Those crying for justice for Bihar’s son are indulging in character assassination of Maharashtra’s son,” Mr. Thackeray said, breaking his silence on allegations against his son Aaditya Thackeray in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.

Mr. Thackeray said the time has come to reconsider the present GST system and if necessary, to modify it as States are not benefiting from this system.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/c30qjz/article32940770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/improve-economy-instead-of-toppling-governments-uddhav-thackeray-tells-bjp/article32940771.ece

136,2020/10/25,Punjab govt acted swiftly in Hoshiarpur case in contrast to U.P. govt in Hathras incident: Amarinder,"The Chief Minister on Saturday had hit out at BJP leaders Nirmala Sitharaman and Prakash Javadekar for their comments over the Hoshiarpur rape-murder case

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday asserted that his government had taken swift action in the Hoshiarpur rape-murder case in sharp contrast to the Uttar Pradesh government’s response to the Hathras incident.

He said the challan in this case will be presented in court this week.

The Chief Minister pointed out that prompt action had been taken by the Punjab Police and the accused had been caught without delay, unlike in the Hathras incident.

“That was why Rahul Gandhi had to rush to Hathras, to secure justice for the victim’s family, and did not need to visit Hoshiarpur,” he said while interacting informally with media persons here.

On Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s remarks on “selective outrage”, he reiterated that had the Punjab government or police failed to respond with swiftness in the Hoshiarpur case, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and others would have reacted the same way as they did in the case of Hathras.

The Chief Minister on Saturday had hit out at BJP leaders Nirmala Sitharaman and Prakash Javadekar for their comments over the Hoshiarpur rape-murder case, dubbing their remarks as “political puffery” with no substance or basis to support their criticism.

The BJP had attacked the Congress on Saturday over alleged rape and killing of a six-year-old girl in Hoshiarpur, as it asked opposition party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra why had they not paid a visit to the family of the victim yet.

A six-year-old girl was allegedly raped, killed and then set on fire. Her half-burnt body was found at a house in a village in Tanda in Hoshiarpur on Wednesday.

Gurpreet Singh and his grandfather Surjit Singh were arrested on charges of murder, rape and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, police had said on Thursday.

Replying to a question, the Chief Minister denied that Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu has been sidelined in Punjab Congress.

On the Enforcement Department (ED) summoning his son Raninder Singh in an alleged foreign exchange violations case, Amarinder Singh said it was not the first time the agency had issued summons to his family.

Ridiculing the Akali allegations of him being hand in glove with the central government on the farm laws issue, the chief minister said “everyone knows who is colluding with whom“.

“It is the Akalis who are mixed up with the BJP, they quit NDA under pressure but are still working together,” he alleged.

Bathinda MP Harsimrat Badal was “clearly involved” in the introduction of the “anti-farmer” ordinances and was a cabinet minister at the time these were brought in by the Union government.

“What did the Akalis do? My government brought the resolution/bills in Vidhan Sabha to reject the central laws,” he added.

Pointing out that the fight was with the central government, Amarinder Singh reiterated his appeal to the farmers to stage ‘dharnas’ in Delhi and not in Punjab, where economic activity was being threatened by their blockade.

His ministers were in talks with farmer unions to resolve the problem, he said, pointing to the fact that only one day’s coal stocks and 10% urea were available with the state.

The option to buy power from the national grid did not exist since the state had no money, he said.

To a question on the status of resolutions on farm laws in other states, the CM said there were 11 non-BJP state governments in the country and the Congress was in power in four states.

All Congress governments would move similar resolutions against the central rules, he said, expressing hope that other non-BJP governments like that of West Bengal would also follow suit.

On the 2018 Dussehra rail tragedy in Amritsar, Amarinder Singh said his government had provided immediate monetary relief but the matter now rested with the Railways, who would be giving the remaining relief to the victims and their families.

To a question on the financial crisis in Punjabi University, the Chief Minister said the previous regime had indulged in haphazard recruitment, but assured that his government will find solutions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/n6jk4x/article32938118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE25AMARINDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pb-govt-acted-swiftly-in-hoshiarpur-case-in-contrast-to-up-govt-in-hathras-incident-amarinder/article32940418.ece

Protesting against PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti’s remarks on the national flag, a group of youths took out a march outside the party office on Sunday and tried to hoist the tricolour atop the building but were stopped by police.

The incident came after the People’s Democratic Party president said she is not interested in contesting elections or holding the tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5 last year are rolled back.

Ms Mufti had said she would hold the national flag only when the separate flag of the erstwhile State is restored.

Amid chants of “Tiranga ka apmaan nahi sahenge (will not tolerate the insult of tricolour)” and anti-PDP sloganeering, the youths led by activist Amandeep Singh came on two-wheelers and attempted to hoist the national flag on the PDP headquarters.

However, they were stopped by the police personnel deployed at the PDP office, officials said, adding the protesters later dispersed peacefully.

“We have no affiliation with any right-wing party. We are nationalist by core and will not tolerate any insult to the tricolor, which is our pride and honour,” Amandeep Singh told reporters.

Mr Singh had on Saturday hoisted the national flag on the boundary wall near the main entrance of the PDP office and had a heated argument with two senior party leaders, including former legislator Firdous Ahmad Tak.

Before leaving, Mr Singh had said that he would return with more youths on Sunday to unfurl the national flag at the building.

After the BJP demanded her arrest over alleged seditious remarks, Ms Mufti said in a tweet on Saturday that the Indian flag stands for diversity and peaceful co-existence among all.

“If anyone has insulted the Tiranga it is BJP that persecutes minorities and sows division and hatred,” the former chief minister alleged.

On Saturday, the Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration that is fighting for the restoration of special status to Jammu and Kashmir met in Srinagar and named National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah as its chairman and Mehbooba Mufti as its deputy chairperson.

Mr Abdullah asserted that the seven-party alliance is an anti-BJP platform and not an anti-national grouping.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v1fu1y/article32932725.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MEHBOOBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/protesters-try-to-hoist-national-flag-at-pdp-office/article32940376.ece

Ten (36%) out of 28 constituencies are red alert constituencies. Red alert constituencies are those where three or more contesting candidates have declared criminal cases against themselves, the report said.

“The directions of the Supreme Court have had no effect on the political parties in selection of candidates as they have again followed their old practice of giving tickets to around 18% candidates with criminal cases. All major parties contesting in Madhya Pradesh by- elections have given tickets to 25% to 50% candidates who have declared criminal cases against themselves,” it said.

The Supreme Court in in February had asked political parties to give reasons for selecting candidates with criminal background and why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected as candidates.

The details of the financial background of the candidates was also given in the report.

Claiming Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had created a “positive atmosphere” in Madhya Pradesh, the former MLA from Damoh told reporters here, “In the 15 months of the Congress government, there was neither development in my region nor did Kamal Nath pay any heed to our demands.”

Mr. Singh took the party’s membership at its Bhopal office in the presence of Mr. Chouhan and State BJP president V.D. Sharma, becoming the 26th Congress MLA to have resigned since March and joined the BJP thereby bringing down the Congress strength in the 230-member Assembly to 87.

“Another MLA was sold to mama’s (reference to Mr. Chouhan) black earnings,” Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh wrote in Hindi on Twitter. “It seems mama will fill more sold-out Congress traitors in the BJP than its real workers. I pity those honest Sangh and BJP workers who have led BJP until now. Where is Jayant Malaiya ji?”

141,2020/10/25,BJP lodges complaint with EC over Mehbooba Mufti’s ‘anti-national’ remarks,"Senior BJP leder Ashwani Kumar Chrungoo has sought de-recognition of PDP over the remarks made by its president.

A senior leader of the BJP has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission of India (ECI), seeking de-recognition of the PDP over the “anti-national and anti-constitution” remarks of its president Mehbooba Mufti.

The former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister on Friday had said that she was not interested in contesting elections or holding the tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5 last year were rolled back.

Ms. Mufti said she would hold the tricolour only when the separate flag of the erstwhile State is restored.

“I request your honour to consider her statements in the light of their seriousness, which are available on the public domain, as anti-national and anti-constitution of India and also de-recognise her party, PDP, as a genuine political party in J&K with immediate effect,” senior BJP leader and in-charge of department of political affairs and feedback, Ashwani Kumar Chrungoo said in his formal complaint to the ECI.

He alleged that the PDP president issued various outrageous statements against Parliament, parliamentarians, the national flag and symbol of the nation and also against the scheme of elections in the Union Territory.

“She didn’t only keep herself confined to the usual political rhetoric on matters that are on her party’s manifesto and agenda but went ahead to question the basis of the national flag, national symbols, sovereignty of parliament and dignity of the parliamentarians,” the complaint read.

“She even went to the extent to say that ‘not to even touch the national flag and also not to contest any election till her dream flag, constitution and status of the UT are given back’,” it said.

Mr. Chrungoo, also a Kashmiri pandit leader, alleged that she even went to the extent to call names of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath who are elected representatives of the people under the due process of the law and the Constitution of India.

“Her offensive and anti-constitutional statements constitute serious contempt of Parliament and also ‘privilege issue’ against the ECI,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v1fu1y/article32932725.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MEHBOOBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-lodges-complaint-with-ec-over-mehbooba-muftis-anti-national-remarks/article32940142.ece
142,2020/10/25,NRIS quota in NLUs an affront to meritorious candidates: Orissa HC,"Court calls upon stakeholders to revisit admission process

Observing that Non-Resident Indian Sponsored (NRIS) category reservation is an affront to meritorious candidates, the Orissa High Court has called upon the Bar Council of India and other stakeholders to revisit the process of admission to National Law Universities (NLUs).

“Worthy students toil day and night to secure a seat in NLUs by cracking Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). But NRIS students, by paying hefty donations, grab the seats of meritorious students,” the court observed.

A Division Bench of Justice Sanju Panda and Justice S.K. Panigrahi said the NRI Sponsored candidates who are very low ranked in the merit list often get seats in NLUs, whereas the general candidates having secured better marks and placed higher in the merit list are denied admission. “This is like reservation for the elite class and this dubious category of reservation is unconstitutional,” the High Court said.

‘Unregulated selection’

The court further observed that the eligibility and selection under the NRIS category are “unregulated, illegal and arbitrary”. It also cited a recent Supreme Court judgment in a case relating to private medical colleges in Rajasthan in which it held that private institutions that offer professional and technical courses have complete discretion to do away with their quota of seats after giving reasonable prior notice.

“The consortium of NLUs, the BCI and all stakeholders involved in the process (of admission) should revisit the so-called NRIS quota and prepare a proper regulation and system. Several studies reveal that the selection process under the NRIS is quite vague, undefined and based on inconsistent parameters,” the High Court said while disposing of a petition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nris-quota-in-nlus-an-affront-to-meritorious-candidates-orissa-hc/article32938472.ece
143,2020/10/25,"Amarinder, Sukhbir engage in war of words over farm laws","Punjab Assembly had on Tuesday rejected the Centre’s laws, passed four Bills

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal once again on Saturday attacked each other over the Centre’s farm laws.

While Capt. Amarinder said the SAD chief has “lost political narrative” over the issue, Mr. Badal alleged that the State Bills passed against the farm laws aimed at sabotaging the farmers’ stir.

According to a statement, Capt. Amarinder said Mr. Badal seemed to have been jolted into desperation by the entire farm laws saga, which had exposed the double standards of the Akalis.

Reacting to Mr. Badal’s statement, accusing the CM of colluding with the Centre to get the rail blockade by farmers lifted, Capt. Amarinder said that strange and senseless remarks showed the Akali leader had completely lost the political narrative, causing him to fumble for words and desperate to find a way out.

On the Akali chief’s suggestion that the State government should have taken the SAD’s advice before bringing the Bills in the Assembly, the CM said, “It seems the NDA government at the Centre has taken the advice of their then allies, the Akalis, in the matter of the anti-farmer, anti-federal and anti-Constitutional farm laws.”

“That would explain why they messed it up so badly and took the unilateral decision to impose laws that are clearly designed to ruin farmers,” he added.

“Does Sukhbir really believe that I would lead my party to a political suicide with such an act?” asked Capt. Amarinder.

Meanwhile, Mr. Badal accused the Chief Minister of not taking his party’s suggestion and said he instead chose to enter into a deal with the Centre and get ‘wishy-washy’ Bills passed with the sole intention of sabotaging the farmers’ agitation. He said the only solution was declaring the entire State as a principal market yard which would have negated the implementation of the Central farm laws in Punjab. He asked the CM if he had annulled the Central agriculture marketing laws and when the new Bills passed in the Vidhan Sabha would come into being.

The Punjab Assembly on Tuesday had adopted a resolution rejecting the Centre’s new farm laws and passed four bills to counter the Centre’s farm laws.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/n6jk4x/article32938118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE25AMARINDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amarinder-sukhbir-engage-in-war-of-words-over-farm-laws/article32938120.ece
144,2020/10/25,Gurugram Police chief pulled up by court,"Woman officer moved plea over denial of promotion; hearing on October 27

A court here has made strong observations against the Gurugram Police Commissioner in a civil suit pertaining to denial of promotion to a woman officer, saying that the Commissioner had made an “unholy attempt” to defeat the rights of the plaintiff and “browbeat” her, adding that the court was not expected to be a “mute spectator” at this juncture.

The matter pertains to Raj Bala, a woman police officer, who was denied promotion on account of a warning as part of disciplinary action against her last year.

After she moved the court seeking redress this year, Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division) Anil Kaushik on September 7 directed the competent authority to consider her plaint as representation and pass speaking orders.

Show-cause notice

However, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mayank Raghava, informed the court this month that her representation was declined and she was, instead, served a show-cause notice for stoppage of four annual increments.

The then Deputy Commissioner of Police, Headquarters, Shashank Kumar Sawan, the Disciplinary Authority, had asked her “to be careful in the future”, on October 25, 2019, and she was later denied promotion.

Mr. Raghava, in his plea, said the ego of senior police officers was apparently hurt since she had moved the court seeking redress.

Taking strong exception to the serving of the notice, the judge observed that the “bias against the plaintiff for her approaching the court was writ large as has been revealed from the sequence of events unfolded in the case”.

Taking into account the fact that the Police Commissioner had issued the show-cause notice almost a year after the order was passed by the Disciplinary Authority and in the wake of the plaintiff moving the court, Mr. Kaushik observed that the “timing indicates naked bias against the plaintiff for her approaching this court”.

Hardeep Hooda, government pleader for the defendants, argued that the Police Commissioner was within his powers under the Punjab Police Rules, 1934, to review the order of the Disciplinary Authority and it was in “course of law”.

Court questions timing

Mr. Kaushik, however, observed that the court could not lose sight of the timing of the show-cause notice and remarked that “it is shocking that this is going on under the very nose of this court”.

Fixing the matter for hearing on October 27, Mr. Kaushik directed the Police Commissioner to file an affidavit on the next date of hearing, deposing in how many cases he has “suo motu reviewed the decisions of the disciplinary authorities subordinate to him” and in how many cases was this done when the matter was pending before the court.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gurugram-police-chief-pulled-up-by-court/article32938117.ece
145,2020/10/25,Drive to check purity of food material,"Teams will inspect quality during festivals in Rajasthan

A core group has been appointed in Rajasthan for an effective monitoring of the ‘Shuddh Ke Liye Yuddh’ (War for the Pure) campaign, which will start from October 26. Special teams will inspect the quality of food material, spices, flour, edible oils and milk and dairy products and collect samples for testing during the drive.

Private institutions engaged in the retail sales of grocery and essential items will also join the campaign, which will continue till November 14. Chief Secretary Rajeeva Swarup said on Saturday that the drive would cover the festive season, when the demand for food products would increase and strict action would be required to check adulteration.

The COVID-19 pandemic has added to the caution among the customers to buy products free of adulteration.

Kirana King Retail Network CEO Anup Kumar said a circular would be issued to all the grocery outlets for taking precautions and supporting the campaign. Mr. Kumar said over 200 retail grocery stores in the State Capital would join the drive by offering the products of high quality.

The core group, which will coordinate with the district-level management committees and local inspection teams, comprises senior officers of the Home, Medical & Health, Food & Civil Supplies and Animal Husbandry & Dairy Departments.

Mr. Swarup, who interacted with the District Collectors through videoconferencing, said the core group would ensure on-the-spot action against those involved in adulteration and monitor the legal process for punishment to the offenders.

Mr. Swarup said the provisions of The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, would be strictly implemented during the drive.

The samples will be sent to the nearest laboratories and the reports sent regularly to the State Control Room. The Chief Secretary said the persons giving information about food adulteration would get a cash reward of ₹51,000 each.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/drive-to-check-purity-of-food-material/article32938114.ece
146,2020/10/25,The AMU connection to Bihar polls,"Maskoor Usmani is the latest among alumni making a foray into State’s politics

It is said when there is an election in Bihar, it causes ripples at Aligarh Muslim University. Despite COVID-19, this October, the impact has been palpable as former AMU Students’ Union president Maskoor Ahmad Usmani is in the fray from Jale Assembly seat in Darbhanga district on a Congress ticket.

The highlight of Mr. Usmani’s tenure in AMU was when he took on the BJP and a section of the media when the Jinnah portrait controversy erupted in May 2018 and it is hard to believe that the Congress would not have measured the consequences before giving him the green signal.

Jinnah’s portrait issue

The right-wing groups led by BJP MP Satish Gautam wanted AMUSU to remove the portrait of Mohammed Ali Jinnah from the Union Hall. Mr. Usmani argued that Jinnah was a founder-member of the university and was conferred life membership in 1938 and the presence of his portrait in the Union Hall only indicated preserving the historical legacy of the university.

But the djinn of Jinnah refused to disappear. As soon as Mr. Usmani got the ticket, Mr. Gautam said giving the ticket reflected the mindset of the Congress. “Hindus know what to do with the well-wisher of Jinnah in the election,” he told reporters.

While acknowledging that AMUSU’s presidentship got Mr. Usmani the ticket to electoral politics as the post carries a value across the country, Mohammad Mohibul Haque, professor of Political Science in AMU, said people know the reality of the Jinnah episode. “The current dispensation is facing the anger of migrant labour. To divert attention, Mr. Usmani is being made a scapegoat to target Congress.”

Prof. Haque, whose ancestors hail from Bihar, said, “Jinnah matters only for the spokespersons of the BJP and the party’s spokespersons in the media houses.”

Coming from a professional course like Bachelor of Dental Studies, Mr. Usmani belied the image of the traditional student politician who stayed on in the campus to fulfil his political aspirations.

Ansab Aamir, a student of engineering who watched the 2017 elections closely, said Mr. Usmani was broadly accepted.

Irrespective of his desperation to find a political niche, his approach is being appreciated. “For the last few months, Mr. Usmani has been running an intense library movement in rural Darbhanga and Madhubani wherein he proposes to establish libraries in villages as centres of educational, cultural, and sports activities,” said Mohammad Sajjad, professor of History at AMU.

“It is a good sign that he is making education central to his politics. He was beaten up by the police and suffered a fracture during the Jinnah controversy but he didn’t compromise. He rather confronted the national media. He is seen as a credible voice,” said Prof. Sajjad.

‘Not an easy fight’

Prof. Haque maintained it would not be an easy fight for Mr. Usmani but as caste remains a significant factor in Bihar politics, Muslim candidates have an advantage.

“As the Hindu vote gets divided, the party’s support base plus Muslim vote become an important factor in constituencies where there is a significant Muslim presence. The caste factor exists among Muslims as well but the internal stratification only manifests when the saffron threat is not there. In the assertion of New Hindutva, the internal stratification of the Muslims stands diluted,” said Prof. Haque.

Hailing from Muzaffarpur, Prof. Sajjad has written extensively on the politics of Bihar. “From Syed Mahmud, a Minister in Nehru’s Cabinet, to Abdul Ghafoor, who was Bihar’s Chief Minister from 1973 to 1975, AMU has been intermittently providing leaders to Bihar politics.”

In recent years, said Prof. Haque, Ali Ashraf Fatmi, the four-time Rashtriya Janata Dal MP from Darbhanga, has been carrying forward the legacy. Mr. Fatmi shifted to the JD(U) last year.

“You will find Aligs (as AMU alumni are called) in all political parties,” said Prof. Haque citing Mohammed Ali Kaiser, who is in the Lok Janshakti Party. He said, it’s a “good sign” that the “public-funded university like AMU” continues to provide the “secular Muslim leadership” and that it is “not coming from Deoband and Nadwa”.

Analysing the influence of AMU alumni back home, Prof. Sajjad said unlike many other universities that were “catering largely to the elite”, AMU had been providing “upward mobility” to “a large number of deprived sections”. “AMU provides them the tools to express themselves and they use their voice back home. And they carry the connection with the alma mater because they feel they would not have been able to cross socio-economic barriers without the time spent at the institution at an affordable cost.”

That’s why, added Prof. Haque, students go to campaign for the Aligs. “It is beyond religion or party affiliations. I remember the special attention former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Verma, an AMU alumnus, used to give us whenever we visited the Capital.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/oej2s0/article32938110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE25MASKOOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/the-amu-connection-to-bihar-polls/article32938111.ece
147,2020/10/25,Case filed against militant outfit for threatening KSU,"A case was registered against an armed Bengali militant outfit on Saturday for threatening to “wage war” against the Khasi Students’ Union (KSU) and the indigenous people of Meghalaya, police said.

The United Bangal Liberation Army sent the threat letter to the KSU’s office here during the day, they said.

“A case was registered against the United Bangal Liberation Army for criminal conspiracy, threatening to wage war against the local populace of Meghalaya and criminal intimidation against the Chief Minister,” Additional Inspector General of Police G.K. Iangrai said.

The case was registered with the Cyber Crime police station and an investigation is under way, he said.

The KSU on Wednesday had put banners reading ‘All Meghalaya Bengalis are Bangladeshis’ across the State, prompting senior BJP leader and former State Governor Tathagata Roy to demand that the students’ body be designated as a “terrorist outfit”.

The police had pulled down the banners and warned of strict action against those trying to “incite communal disharmony”.

The outfit, in the banners, also mourned the death of one of its members in clashes over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Bengali-dominated Ichamati village along the India-Bangladesh border in February.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/case-filed-against-militant-outfit-for-threatening-ksu/article32938106.ece
148,2020/10/25,"Baroda bypoll: Cong., BJP trade charges","BJP has no achievements to show: Hooda; Cong. rule akin to darkness: Abhimanyu

Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders on Saturday traded charges over lack of development in a bid to woo the Baroda Assembly constituency voters with just over a week to go for the bypoll.

Launching a full frontal attack on the BJP on his third day of campaign, former two-time Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the coalition government in Haryana had no achievements to show after six years in office and was seeking votes through political rhetoric and creating social division.

Addressing gatherings at more than half-a-dozen villages, including Baroda, Mr. Hooda said the BJP’s situation was so pitiable that instead of showcasing its work, the party was demanding answers from the Opposition. “Our list of works is long, whereas BJP does not have a single achievement to show,” he said.

“People of Baroda and Haryana know the difference between the two parties as our government worked to empower farmers. The rate of almost every crop was increased 2 to 3 times during the Congress rule. At that time, the Central government had waived debt of ₹72,000 crore of the farmers, while in Haryana, loans of ₹2,200 crore and interest payments of ₹850 crore were waived off,” said Mr. Hooda.

Counter charges

However, former State Finance Minister and senior BJP leader Capt. Abhimanyu said the situation of Baroda during the 10-year Congress rule was similar to the darkness reigning under the foot of the lighthouse. He said Baroda remained untouched by development. He added that Mr. Hooda was directly responsible for it since he never paid attention to this region.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/baroda-bypoll-cong-bjp-trade-charges/article32938105.ece

152,2020/10/25,Man held for developing tatkal ticket booking apps,"Officers from the Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Friday night arrested a man in Tiruppur on charges of developing two fraudulent mobile applications for tatkal ticket booking and swindling money to the tune of ₹ 20 lakh.

RPF sources said on Saturday that S. Yuvarajaa (32), a native of Pothiyapalayam village panchayat in Kangeyam Block, allegedly amassed the money between 2016 and 2020.

He developed an application called ‘Super Tatkal’ in January 2016 and another one named ‘Super Tatkal Pro’ in March 2019 to get confirmed tatkal e-tickets. The application demanded money from customers in the form of prepaid ‘coins pack’ (10 ‘coins’ worth ₹ 20), and for each booking, five ‘coins’ were deducted.

With nearly one lakh users having downloaded these applications, Yuvarajaa directed the money through a payment gateway to his bank account, and swindled around ₹ 20 lakh in four years, the sources said.

The accused Yuvarajaa did his M.Tech at Indian Institute of Technology – Kharagpur, and was based in Bengaluru where he developed the two applications. Upon announcement of the COVID-19 lockdown, he returned to his hometown in Kangeyam in March.

His online activities were recently detected by the RPF Intelligence Officials of Tiruppur along with the RPF Cyber Cell at Southern Railway Headquarters, Chennai. The RPF Cyber Cell collected digital evidences such as the accused’s location, source codes of the server and application, end-users list and bank statements, the sources said.

Yuvarajaa was booked under Section 143(2) (Penalty for unauthorised carrying on of business of procuring and supplying of railway tickets) of the Railways Act and and remanded in judicial custody on Saturday.

The two illegal applications were subsequently deactivated, the RPF sources noted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/man-held-for-developing-tatkal-ticket-booking-apps/article32938021.ece
153,2020/10/25,‘HC stay on Tangedco circular is a message for local bodies’,"The stay granted by the vacation bench of the Madras High Court on operation of a Tangedco circular has a message for local bodies as well as the issue relates to building completion certificate.

The bench comprising Justice V. Parthiban and Justice G.R. Swaminathan stayed the October 6 Tangedco order that did away the necessity of certificate for issue of new power connection. The circular undid the orders it had passed in May and July this year insisting on building completion certificate for new power connection.

At the time of the issuing the orders, the Tangedco had quoted the Court order in writ petition 14520 of 2017 and the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019.

Now that the Court had stayed the October 6 circular, the Tangedco must start insisting on building completion certificate from those seeking power connection. But that is not the end of story.

The stay also has a message for local bodies, says Coimbatore Consumer Cause Secretary K. Kathirmathiyon. “What applies to the Tangedco also applies to local bodies in demanding building completion certificate but for giving water and sewerage connection.”

Sadly, the local bodies do not insist on completion certificate, though. And, worse, they do not issue completion certificate, either, he says and refers to a Coimbatore Corporation letter to the Tangedco that said that the civic body assessing building for property tax was as good as having issued completion certificate.

Mr. Kathirmathiyon, who filed the petition to stay the October 6 Tangedco circular, says when the Court hears his petition he will point out that the local bodies that ought to issue the completion certificate have not followed the Rules and the difference between the Tangedco and local bodies was that the former attempted violation of the Rule by issuing a circular and the latter has violated the Rule without any circular.

Besides, the local bodies issuing water and sewerage connection without the completion certificate is contempt of the Court.

He further says that the very reason that the State Government framed the Rules is to prevent construction of illegal buildings as no builder likes to construct a building that will not have power, water or sewer connection.

By ignoring the Rule, the local body has started treating violators on a par with those who construct as per rules, he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/hc-stay-on-tangedco-circular-is-a-message-for-local-bodies/article32938015.ece
154,2020/10/25,Kerala unrelenting on raising storage in Siruvani reservoir,"State Govt. taking efforts to have the water level raised to full reservoir level

A look at the water level in a few reservoirs in Kerala and at Siruvani goes against the explanation that the Kerala Government had given to Tamil Nadu – that it has lowered water level in all its reservoirs post the 2018 floods.

As of October 24, Vazhani and Peechi reservoirs in Thrissur and Walayar, Malampuzha and Mangalam reservoirs in Palakkad are in red alert. In Vazhani, for instance, the Kerala Irrigation Department, as per data available in public domain, has water level at 62.13 m as against the full reservoir level of 62.48.

In the nearby Malampuzha reservoir, the Department has let the water level touch 114.5m. The full reservoir level is 115.06m.

In addition to the five ‘red alert’ reservoirs, Kerala has put two reservoirs in orange alert category and one in blue alert category.

But in Siruvani, it has maintained water level at 90% of the storage level, which is 1.67m below the full reservoir level. The Kerala Government reducing water level in Siruvani comes even as the Tamil Nadu Government has been taking efforts to have the water level increased to the full reservoir level. The Tamil Nadu Government through the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board has been saying that the Siruvani Reservoir is a drinking water lifeline for Coimbatore city and that the reduction of 1.67m or thereabout equals around a month’s supply to the city. But the Kerala Government has not yet ceded space, say the Board sources, adding that the organisation is hopeful that Kerala will see merit in its argument.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/kerala-unrelenting-on-raising-storage-in-siruvani-reservoir/article32937996.ece

M. Gnanamsoundharya told The Hindu on Saturday that she did not attend private coaching classes. She prepared using the State Board textbooks, with occasional references to National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) textbooks for Classes XI and XII.

“I began preparing for NEET only after completing the Class XII public examinations,” she said.

Previous year question papers and support from the school teachers aided her preparation.

She attended the online NEET crash course organised by the Department of School Education for about 10 days in June and later quit because the teaching pace was “a little fast” for her. “I was satisfied after writing the examination, but I could not believe that I came first in the district among the government school students,” Ms. Gnanamsoundharya said. She aspires to become a gynaecologist.

According to her mother Muthukala, the girl’s father worked as a labourer in a factory at Vaiyampalayam. Five years ago he met with an accident and after that he was not able to go to work regularly. “We supported our daughter to the maximum extent,” she said, as she expressed happiness over her daughter’s achievement.

Headmistress of the S.S. Kulam Government Higher Secondary School R. Sridevi said that Ms. Gnanamsoundharya was among the four students from the school who cleared NEET 2020. “She is a hard worker,” the headmistress said, adding that her medical seat might get confirmed if the 7.5% horizontal reservation for government school students was approved.

If she does not get through, the school teachers and some donors are planning to fund her private coaching at a Namakkal-based institute to help her score better in NEET next year, Ms. Sridevi said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/3s7ax3/article32937990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB25NEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/having-cleared-neet-she-wants-to-be-a-gynaecologist/article32937991.ece
156,2020/10/25,Student recreates Picasso’s artwork,"Was done as a tribute to the Spanish painter on his 139th birth anniversary

A first-year student of NIFT-TEA College of Knitwear Fashion, Tiruppur recreated one of the works of the renowned 20th century artist Pablo Picasso as a tribute to him on his 139th birth anniversary on October 25.

M. Sneha Adriana, a student studying first semester at the Apparel Fashion Design Department, said on Saturday that she was motivated by her teacher G. Boopathi Vijay to attempt Picasso’s ‘Guernica’, one of his most recognised works. While the original work painted in 1937 was done on canvas with dimensions 3.49 m x 7.76 m, she said that her recreation was done on multiple chart papers stuck together to get a reduced dimension of 3.49 ft x 7.76 ft.

The work took eight days to complete, with three days only for recreating the outlines of the original painting. “Through recreating this work, I learned that Picasso embraced imperfections and that it is possible to convey multiple emotions using only a few colours,” Ms. Adriana said.

Mr. Vijay said that the student completed this work at her residence in Tiruchi, from where she has been attending classes online due to the COVID-19 lockdown. “Only those who can understand the painting could recreate it,” he said referring to the complexity of the original work.

The painting will be displayed in the college when it re-opens, he said.

An anti-war painting, Picasso painted “Guernica” in the backdrop of the bombing of the town named Guernica by Italian and German forces in 1937.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/nbnvxk/article32937969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB25NIFT-TEA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/student-recreates-picassos-artwork/article32937970.ece

158,2020/10/25,HC okays Dussehra celebrations at Nanded gurudwara,"‘This should not be used as a precedent by others to seek similar permissions’

The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has allowed a Nanded gurudwara to conduct its annual Dussehra celebrations going on since three centuries.

However, Takht Sachkhand Shri Hazur Abchal Nagar Sahib will have to follow strict guidelines laid down by the court, which include mandatory COVID-19 test and no congregation.

A Division Bench of Justices S.V. Gangapurwala and Shrikant Kulkarni was hearing a petition filed by The Takht Sachkhand Shri Hazur Abchal Nagar Sahib Board, Nanded, through its secretary Ravinder Singh. The petition was filed assailing the order passed on October 21, 2020 by the Secretary, the Disaster Management, Relief and Rehabilitation, Revenue and Forests Department, M.S. Mantralaya, Mumbai, which had rejected the Board’s representation to celebrate/conduct the Dussehra, takhat isnan, dipmala mahalla, gurta gaddi kirtan and gurta-gaddi sampathi kirtan darbar nagar kirtan event at Nanded.

The court said, “The Board may celebrate the event of Dussehra by observing certain conditions: one Palkhi Sahib with Shri Guru Granth Sahibji; historical Nishan Sahib 16 numbers; horses of Guru Sahib, five numbers; Kirtan Jathe 03 numbers. The same shall be on two large open trucks. Sixteen persons would board one truck and eight persons would board another truck.

Only those persons whose reports are Covid-19 negative shall be permitted to board the trucks. The said open trucks would be accompanied by pilot car and the escort car of the Police Department. The petitioner shall take videograph of the entire event from the stage of loading and the culmination of the event. En route, there shall not be congregation of persons. No person shall accompany the two open trucks on foot,” the court mentioned.

The Bench said, “The order is being passed by way of an exception, which is not intended to be used as a precedent by other persons, to seek permissions, to hold any festival/festivities, which would involve by their very nature congregation of people.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/8cgq5g/article32938226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bm-gurudwara-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/hc-okays-dussehra-celebrations-at-nanded-gurudwara/article32938227.ece
159,2020/10/25,"IPL 2020 | You have painful 12 hours left in IPL, but enjoy every moment: Dhoni tells CSK","If KKR win their next match against KXIP, CSK will not be able to make the playoffs

Chennai Super Kings’ IPL campaign may well end on Monday, which will be their first without reaching the play-offs, if KKR win their next match but Mahendra Singh Dhoni wants his team to enjoy themselves even as they endure a painful next 12 hours.

KKR are on 12 points and a win against KXIP on Monday will take them to 14 points. Three other sides -- Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore - have already got 14 points.

CSK, on the other hand, can go up to 12 points even if they win their next two games.

“It does hurt when you don’t do well so you try to amplify certain emotions. So that the guys just don’t drop the game. That can leave with 12 painful hours of the remaining time in the tournament. You have to enjoy the game no matter where you are on the table,” Dhoni said during the post-match presentation.

The last two games could well be inconsequential but the CSK skipper wants his men to just go out there and enjoy.

“If you are not enjoying the cricket, it can become cruel and painful. So I am glad with how the youngsters have responded.”

The eight-wicket victory over RCB on Sunday was the kind of performance that Dhoni always wanted from his team during the tournament.

“I felt this one was one of the perfect games. Everything went to plan, and the execution was there. We kept picking wickets, and kept them to a total that was slightly below par.”

He lauded spinners Imran Tahir and Mitchell Santner who kept things tight while Ruturaj Gaikwad also got some amount of praise from the legend.

“The wicket was on the slower side, and the spinners did a good job. We haven’t been very consistent with the batting.

“Today, the start was very good. Rutu batted well. He backed himself to play the shots he is known for. Looking to time the ball, if you look for four, you can get six,” Dhoni said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gs2qe9/article32940851.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CSKKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-you-have-painful-12-hours-left-in-ipl-but-enjoy-every-moment-dhoni-tells-csk/article32940852.ece
160,2020/10/25,Indian Premier League 2020 | Ben Stokes hundred gives Royals much-needed win over Mumbai,"The win also helped his team stay on in the race for a place in the playoffs.

Ben Stokes knows a thing or two about playing stunning knocks. He came up with one (107 not out, 60b, 14x4, 3x6) on Sunday at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium to power Rajasthan Royals to a crushing eight-wicket victory over table-topper Mumbai Indians, with eight balls to spare, chasing a daunting 195.



The win also helped his team stay on in the race for a place in the playoffs.

Watching the recently converted opener complete his second IPL hundred with a huge six over mid-wick off James Pattinson, and then hitting the winning boundary off the next ball, from the other end was Sanju Samson (54 not out, 31b, 4x4, 3x6).



The duo added 152 for the unfinished third wicket. Samson had joined Stokes in the fifth over when captain Steven Smith played on to fellow-Australian James Pattinson, who had already sent back Robin Uthappa.



From then on, it was a relentless leather chase for the Mumbai fielders, as Stokes and Samson showed how to chase a stiff target without too many risks.



They batted sensibly, ran exceptionally well between the wickets and kept the asking rate within control. They played some lovely shots, too.



Stokes had been criticised for not scoring briskly enough at the top of the order, while Sanju had been accused of giving away his wicket too easily.



Nobody could have complained about them on this night.



Earlier, a savage 60 not out off just 21 balls from Hardik Pandya (2x4, 7x6) gave a strong finish to the Mumbai innings, which had lost momentum in the middle.



From the last four overs, Mumbai plundered 74 runs. The heist was started by Saurabh Tiwary (34, 25b, 4x4, 1x6), who took 17 off Jofra Archer in the 17th over.



That was only an aberration for the champion bowler, who came back in his next over to dismiss Tiwary and conceded only three runs.



But, at the other end, seamers were getting smashed all around the park by Hardik, who gave a splendid exhibition of power hitting. Ankit Rajpoot and Kartik Tyagi went for 27 apiece in the last two overs as Hardik took Mumbai to a formidable total.



It certainly must have been more than the team would have hoped for when it lost its second wicket, as Ishan Kishan (37, 36b, 4x4, 1x6) fell to a brilliant one-handed catch – leaping in the air – by Archer near the third man boundary. The opener had added 83 for the second wicket with Suryakumar Yadav (40, 26b, 4x4, 1x6), who became the first of the two batsmen caught in the deep by Stokes.



There was, of course, more to come from Stokes.

161,2020/10/25,Kapil Dev discharged from hospital,"The World Cup winning captain had undergone angioplasty.

India’s first World Cup winning-captain Kapil Dev was on Sunday discharged from a city hospital, two days after undergoing angioplasty following a heart attack.

The 61-year-old complained of chest pain on Thursday following which he was taken to Fortis Escorts Heart Institute’s emergency department.

He is doing fine now.

“Mr. Kapil Dev got discharged today afternoon. He’s doing fine and can resume his regular daily activity soon. He’ll be under regular follow-up consultation with Dr. Atul Mathur,” the hospital said in a statement.

Angioplasty is a procedure to open blocked arteries and restore normal blood flow to the heart.

Following his admission, Kapil’s condition was evaluated and an emergency coronary angioplasty was performed by Dr. Mathur, who is the director of cardiology department at the Fortis Escorts Heart Institute.

“Dr Atul Mathur did Kapil paji’s angioplasty. He is fine and discharged” his former India teammate Chetan Sharma tweeted along with a photo of Kapil and the doctor who performed the procedure.

The legendary all-rounder was wished a speedy recovery by many on social media, including India’s current captain Virat Kohli and batting great Sachin Tendulkar among others.

One of India’s greatest cricketers, Kapil played 131 Tests and 225 ODIs.

He remains the only player in cricket’s history to claim over 400 wickets (434) and accumulate more than 5000 runs in Tests.

He also served as India’s national coach between 1999 and 2000.

162,2020/10/25,IPL 2020 | CSK hang in by a thread after beating RCB by 8 wickets,"Ruturaj Gaikwad (65 not out off 51 balls) showed his potential with a maiden fifty, Sam Curran was once again brilliant up front and also at the death

Chennai Super Kings finally displayed the much-needed intent, keeping themselves just mathematically alive with a comprehensive eight-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore in an Indian Premier League match here on Sunday.

The fearless cricket that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni so expected came to the fore as they chased down a target of 146 in 18.4 overs to take their tally to eight points.

Young Ruturaj Gaikwad (65 not out off 51 balls) showed his potential with a maiden fifty but skipper Dhoni wouldn’t be wrong in thinking that it came too late in the day when the ‘Yellow Brigade’ is all but out of the play-off reckoning.

Gaikwad and veteran Ambati Rayudu (39 off 27 balls) added 67 runs in 8.2 overs for the second wicket to finish off a chase in style although it might have been too little too late.

However, with CSK’s maximum achievable points tally set to be 12, a victory for KKR in their next game against Kings XI Punjab on Monday, will officially end the campaign for Dhoni’s brigade.

KKR are currently on 12 points while Mumbai Indians (before Sunday evening game), Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore are all on 14 points.

On Sunday, CSK looked purposeful in their pursuit of a small target.

Gaikwad, one of the most talked-about young players in this league, finally had a good day in office, hitting four fours and three sixes. He looked assured while choosing the loose deliveries as he swept Yuzvendra Chahal for a boundary and came down the track to loft Moeen Ali for a six.

Fittingly, a hooked six by Gaikwad brought CSK’s much-awaited win.

Rayudu, at the other end, used Navdeep Saini’s pace, as he slashed him over backward point for a six and then again showed intent by charging down the track for a boundary.

Earlier, the celebrated pair of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers were briefly entertaining but Chennai Super Kings managed to restrict Royal Challengers Bangalore to 145 for 6 in their stipulated 20 overs.

Sam Curran was once again brilliant up-front and also at the death, finishing with figures of 3/19 in three overs.

Credit to the CSK bowlers as they conceded only 20 runs in the last three overs and managed to take four wickets.

IPL’s most prolific batting pair of Kohli and de Villiers added 82 runs with some great technique against CSK spinners Imran Tahir (1/30 in 4 overs) and Mitchell Santner (1/23 in 4 overs) who kept a tight leash during the middle overs.

Deepak Chahar was once again steady, finishing with 2 for 31 in his four-over spell.

Kohli scored 50 off 43 balls with a four and a six while De Villiers helped himself to a polished 39 off 36 balls. De Villiers hit four boundaries.

The CSK bowlers did well enough to take the pace off the ball which made it difficult for RCB batsmen to score. Yet, Kohli and De Villiers did manage to take control of the proceedings but failed to finish with a flourish.

However, whenever Tahir flighted the ball, his country-mate De Villiers was quick to reach to the pitch of the deliveries to drive elegantly through the covers.

Kohli had one bowler’s backdrive off Tahir and for a good measure lifted Ravindra Jadeja for a straight maximum which was his 200th six.

Kohli’s off-side play was another lesson for all youngsters as he would just adjust his wrists at the last moment to hit those inside-out shots off the spinners.

With ball stopping and coming off the surface, Kohli never looked out of control during his third half-century of the season.

It took a tremendous diving catch at long-off from Faf du Plessis off Sam Curran to dismiss Kohli as RCB fell short of the 150-run mark.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/17bxej/article32940521.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RUTURAJ-CSK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-royal-challengers-bangalore-vs-chennai-super-kings-dubai/article32940263.ece
163,2020/10/25,IPL 2020 | Confident KXIP looks to sustain momentum against rejuvenated KKR,"KXIP are placed fifth on the points table having won five games from 11 outings, while KKR are a notch better, occupying the fourth spot with 12 points.

Belatedly getting into the groove with four wins on the trot, Kings XI Punjab will hope to keep the juggernaut rolling when they take on a resurgent Kolkata Knight Riders in a mid-table IPL clash in Sharjah on Monday.

KXIP are placed fifth on the points table having won five games from 11 outings, while KKR are a notch better, occupying the fourth spot with 12 points.

A win for Punjab will elevate them to the top four, while a victory for KKR will take them to 14 points, the same as the top three teams in the contest, strengthening their playoff chances.

With the race to play-offs heating up, both sides know the value of a win on Monday.

KXIP had roared back to form, snapping their five match losing-streak with a win over third-placed Royal Challengers Bangalore. Since then the KL Rahul-led side has not looked back, defeating the top two sides in the tournament — Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals — besides Sunrisers Hyderbad.

However, they must also win their remaining matches for a shot at the playoffs.

KXIP’s bowling has been their weakest link. Barring Mohammad Shami and Ravi Bishnoi, none of the bowlers have inspired confidence, especially in the death overs.

But when their batting unit failed to put runs on the board on Saturday, the KXIP bowlers produced an excellent display of death over bowling against Sunrisers Hyderabad. They defended 126 by taking five wickets in the final two overs to eke out an incredible win.

KXIP have the in-form batsmen in skipper Rahul, who is the leading run scorer of the tournament, and Mayank Agarwal. The presence of flamboyant Chris Gayle has inspired the team, and since his inclusion in the playing XI, the Punjab-based outfit has not lost a single game.

Nicholas Pooran, too, has looked dangerous but the shaky form of Glenn Maxwell remains a concern.

Agarwal missed the match against SRH due to a bruised knee but the opener is expected to be back for the clash against KKR.

KKR will also be all fired up after their comprehensive win over the formidable Delhi Capitals and would be desperate to keep the winning momentum going.

After the embarrassing eight-wicket loss to Royal Challengers Bangalore, the two-time champions did well to regroup and inflict a 59-run defeat on the Capitals, who occupy the second spot in the points table.

Promoted to open the innings, Nitish Rana revelled in his new role and smashed a whirlwind 81 while sharing a game-changing 115-run stand with Sunil Narine (64). Leg- spinner Varun Chakravarthy then tore apart the DC middle-order with a five-wicket haul.

If KKR wishes to seal a play-off spot, their batsmen need to step up, shrug off their inconsistency and win matches for the team. Barring Rana (81) and Narine (64), everyone else failed against DC.

The KKR bowlers have done well to fashion victories and the addition of Lockie Fergusen has only strengthened the pace attack, which also includes Australian Pat Cummins.

Teams (from):

Kolkata Knight Riders: Eoin Morgan (c), Shubman Gill, Nitish Rana, Rahul Tripathi, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Andre Russell, Kuldeep Yadav, Lockie Ferguson, Pat Cummins, Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine, Tom Banton, Siddhesh Lad, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Prasidh Krishna, Sandeep Warrior, Shivam Mavi, Rinku Singh, Chris Green, M Siddharth and Nikhil Naik.

165,2020/10/25,Delhi’s air quality continues to be ‘very poor’,"Some locations of the city entered the “severe” zone but that will be shortlived as winds are expected to increase slightly

Delhi’s air quality remained in the “very poor” category on Sunday morning with the Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded at 352.

Areas like Mundka, Anand Vihar, Jahangirpuri, Vivek Vihar and Bawana recorded “severe” levels of air pollution, authorities said.

The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), said some locations entered the “severe” zone but that will be shortlived as winds are expected to increase slightly.

It said the air quality could improve on Monday.

“Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) is in the ‘very poor’ category with few locations entering a higher zone but that will be shortlived. This is mainly because the extremely calm local surface winds, which were prevailing yesterday, are likely to increase slightly and may further pick-up by October 26,” the SAFAR said.

It added that the AQI is predicted to remain in the “very poor” range, but without further deterioration.

“Slow improvement in the current condition is expected by October 26, leading to a middle range of ‘very poor’,” it said.

The SAFAR said the stubble-fire count stood at 1,292 on Friday and its share in Delhi’s pollution was 9%.

The AQI was recorded at 346 on Saturday, at 366 on Friday and at 302 the previous day.

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe“.

Ten monitoring stations in the national capital entered the “severe” zone on Friday, according to SAMEER, the AQI-monitoring mobile application developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

The figures are based on data collected from 36 monitoring stations in the city.

The Delhi government has kick-started its “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” anti-pollution campaign, for which it has deployed 2,500 environment marshals at 100 traffic signals across the city to generate awareness and curb vehicular pollution.

The drive will be carried out in all the 70 Assembly constituencies of the national capital till November 15.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a3jlhu/article32940069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THDELHIPOLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhis-air-quality-continues-to-be-very-poor/article32940070.ece

On September 30, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in its guidelines gave powers to the States to decide if they wanted to open schools from October 15, but the Delhi government has not allowed schools to function in the city because of high number of virus cases.

Delhi on Saturday witnessed over 4,000 fresh COVID-19 cases for a second consecutive day with 4,116 persons testing positive in the past 24 hours, according to a health bulletin released by the city government. Also, 36 more deaths were reported, pushing the toll to 6,225. Of the total 3,52,520 cases, 3,19,828 have recovered and there are 26,467 active cases, the highest in the Capital in 23 days.

The number of people in hospitals and under home isolation also increased on Saturday. Out of the total 15,737 beds available for COVID-19 treatment in Delhi, 66.1% were vacant, stated the government data.

The positivity rate (percentage of people testing positive every 100 tests done) was 7.4% — the highest in over a month.

Hunger strike

Five resident doctors of North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital continued their indefinite hunger strike for the second day on Saturday against non-payment of salaries of over 220 resident doctors of the hospital for three months.

The five doctors started their hunger strike on the hospital premises at 4 p.m. on Friday and had spent the night at the hospital, which used to be a COVID-19 treatment facility.

The resident doctors of the hospital have been on strike since October 5 over the salary issue.

Attacking the BJP on the issue, the ruling AAP said that the North civic body should be handed over to it for one year and promised to run it better within the same budget and revenue.

“It is unfortunate that at a time when organisations and institutions are giving bonuses to their workers for the festive season, the municipal corporation is not even paying the salaries to its employees,” AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/3ip83z/article32938434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24KEJRIFLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-pitches-for-free-covid-19-vaccine-for-everyone/article32938435.ece

169,2020/10/25,DU’s third cut-off list offers little hope to students,"Most university colleges close admission to their more popular courses

Delhi University on Saturday released its third cut-off list for its various merit-based undergraduate programmes and asked the eligible candidates to complete admission formalities via online mode.

For students pegging their hopes on a drastic decrease in the cut-off required, the list offered little hope with most colleges closing admission to their more popular courses.

Minimal dip

Those colleges that still had general category seats to offer, reduced their required marks mostly by a few decimal points.

At Lady Shri Ram College for Women, applications were closed for BA (Hons) in Sanskrit and Hindi. However, for BA (Hons) in journalism, political science, psychology, students needed 99%, 99.25% and 99.50% respectively.

LSR, in the first list, had set the tone for the admission season this year by asking for a perfect score for admission into three courses.

At Miranda House College, courses like BA (Hons), political science, sociology, philosophy, geography and Sanskrit were closed leaving students with an opportunity to seek admission in courses like English, history among others.

At Shri Ram College for Commerce, students needed 98.75% for BA (Hons) economics and 98.12% for BCom (Hons).

At Kamala Nehru College, most of the seats had been taken with only seats for BA (Hons) Hindi, Sanskrit among those open.

At Hindu College, majority of the courses were closed for admission with courses in sociology, BCom (Hons) and economics, requiring a cut off of 98%.

Admission under the third cut-off list will take place between October 26 and October 28. The last date for payment of fee under the list is October 30.

More lists

The university had earlier announced that it would be releasing five cut-off lists before the new session commences on November 18.

After that, it would release special cut-off lists according to the seats left vacant.

The admission under the fourth and fifth cut-off lists are scheduled to commence on November 2 and November 9, respectively.

Under the second cut-off list, DU officials said that 22,147 applicants had paid the fees and completed the process.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/unq92r/article32938050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24DELPRIYADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dus-third-cut-off-list-offers-little-hope-to-students/article32938051.ece
170,2020/10/25,CM inaugurates two flyovers in east Delhi,"‘Economical’ facility to provide seamless travel for commuters from ISBT to U.P. border, says Kejriwal

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday inaugurated the newly constructed Seelampur-Shastri Park flyover, which will be a major relief to commuters between Welcome in north-east Delhi and Kashmere Gate and Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border.

Congratulating the people of Delhi and the PWD officials and engineers for the completion of the project, Mr. Kejriwal said that the residents were proud of living in the national capital due to all the facilities and amenities provided by the Delhi government.

The Shastri Park flyover consists of six lanes and is constructed at a length of 700 metres, whereas the Seelampur flyover is constructed at a length of 1,200 metres and eases the commute of vehicles travelling over the Dharampura crossing towards Shahdara. The construction of the new flyover will bring relief to around 1.5 lakh vehicles which seem to travel through the route daily.

“First of all, I want to congratulate the residents of East Delhi for these two flyovers. The people of East Delhi used to face long traffic jams for longer hours. But now, travel from ISBT to U.P. border can now be completed within a span of 10 minutes without any traffic jams and with a smooth ride,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“The flyover constructed is of good quality. The tender sanctioned for this project was ₹303 crore, but, such is the honesty with which the AAP government functions that our engineers saved ₹53 crore. With a great construction quality, built under ₹250 crore, this piece of magnificence is both economical and effective. Since the inception of AAP government in Delhi, we are saving money on all projects. The AAP government has been saving money in every project,” he also said.

Delay in completion

The foundation stone for the newly constructed flyover was laid by Mr. Kejriwal on February 10, 2019. Due to the rising levels of pollution and the implementation of GRAP guidelines in 2019, construction projects were banned during the night which brought the flyover construction to a standstill, the government said.

However, the flyover was 70% completed until October 2019, and despite the implementation of anti-construction guidelines and a six-month halt due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the project was completed in a time duration of 19 months, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/daofsd/article32938033.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24DELPRIYAFLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cm-inaugurates-two-flyovers-in-east-delhi/article32938034.ece

Four members of a family have been arrested for allegedly cheating at least five banks of ₹20 crore by forging papers and availing loan by mortgaging property, which was acquired by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, the police said on Saturday.

Joint Commissioner of Police (Economic Offences Wing) O.P. Mishra said that the accused have been identified as Ashwani Arora, Vijay Arora and their wives.

The police said that the accused duped Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Syndicate Bank, Karnataka Bank and OBC Bank.

The police said that the accused prepared forged chain of property papers and on the basis of these forged documents, they succeeded in registering the property fraudulently before the Registrar Office either in their name or in the name of persons known to them.

“These accused persons also created multiple identities by changing their names and parentage. They also created multiple identity papers in order to evade the scrutiny process adopted by these banks.

172,2020/10/25,Education Ministry seeks enquiry against DU V-C,"In letter to Kovind, it orders action against Yogesh Tyagi’s Registrar appointee

The Education Ministry wrote to the President’s office on Saturday, seeking an enquiry against Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, according to senior officials. The Ministry has also directed strict action to be taken against Prof. Tyagi’s appointee as the Registrar of the University.

The Ministry’s intervention into the ongoing power struggle at the university could now result in the ouster of Prof. Tyagi, who has been on leave allegedly on medical grounds for more than three months.

‘Misgovernance’

The President of India is the Visitor of DU, the only figure above the V-C in the university’s hierarchy. The Education Ministry’s letter to the President, sent on Saturday, has asked him to use his authority to order an “enquiry into all issues of misgovernance”, senior officials said. Prof. Tyagi is likely to be asked to take leave pending enquiry.

The current power struggle at DU came to light on Wednesday, when both Prof Tyagi, and Pro Vice-Chancellor P.C. Joshi, who had been acting the V-C during his absence, appointed different people to the post of Registrar.

On Thursday, the Ministry backed Prof. Joshi and his appointee Vikas Gupta, and directed that Prof. Tyagi’s orders issued in his absence be considered invalid. However, Prof. Tyagi’s Registrar appointee, P.C., Jha had written to the Ministry on Friday, insisting that the V-C’s decisions were in compliance with the Act, Statutes and Ordinances of the university.

On Saturday, the Ministry shot back with a letter, sent from Deputy Secretary Birendra Kumar Singh to Registrar Vikas Gupta. “This Ministry is in receipt of a letter dated 23.10.2020 received from one Shri P.C. Jha claiming to be Registrar of Delhi University. It is requested to ascertain who is this person and if he turns out to be an employee of Delhi University, then strict action as per the Delhi University Act, 1922 and Statutes and Ordinances made thereunder may be taken,” read the letter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/article18421452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE11-INDEXYOGESHTYAGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/education-ministry-seeks-enquiry-against-du-v-c/article32937966.ece
173,2020/10/25,NCR’s annual battle for clear skies begins,"Whether measures enforced this time round will help cities rein in air pollution, given the ongoing pandemic, is a moot point

Winter is almost here and the perennial battle of the National Capital Region (NCR) against air pollution, arising out of both local factors and the burning of agricultural stubble, has begun once again.

Air pollution control measures under the “very poor” and “severe” categories of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) have been enforced in the NCR cities from October 15, and enforcement of anti-pollution norms by various agencies is currently under way. Whether these are able to rein in air pollution, especially with the added risk presented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic this year, remains to be seen.

The GRAP is a set of emergency measures to be taken to reduce air pollution, including odd-even vehicle rationing policy, depending on the level of pollution. Currently, a ban is in place on the use of diesel generators in NCR cities, except for emergency purposes.

GRAP measures

The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) had written to various States earlier this month to implement the GRAP measures.

If the pollution of Delhi further increases, then GRAP measures under “severe+ or emergency” category will kick in.

These measures, include stopping entry of trucks into Delhi, stopping construction activities and implementing the odd-even scheme. The severe+ measures are implemented when the PM2.5 level crosses 300 microgram per cubic metre or PM10 level crosses 500 microgram per cubic metre and persist for 48 hours or more.

The Delhi government has been carrying out an anti-dust campaign and has imposed fines as high as ₹50 lakh on a single violator.

The New Delhi Municipal Corporation was fined ₹1 crore for inaction against open garbage burning in its limits.

According to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi government has also delineated 13 pollution hotspots across the Capital for which specific plans are being created for implementation of anti-pollution action. The government has also created a dedicated war room to monitor air pollution levels.

Irrespective of the GRAP measures and conditions, the Delhi government had imposed the odd-even scheme last year from November 4-15. This was announced by the government last year in mid-September, even before the pollution touched “severe+” levels as a pre-emptive action. However, this year, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said that the scheme will be the “last weapon”, only if everything else fails.

Meanwhile, both the Delhi Traffic Police and the enforcement wing of the Transport Department have begun action against vehicular pollution.

Delhi Joint CP (Traffic) Meenu Chaudhary said that to curb pollution levels the traffic police is working on three measures.

“First, prosecution is being carried out at hotspots and all over Delhi. The Delhi pollution control committee has identified 13 pollution hotspots in the city. We have deployed extra officers at these spots to ensure dedicated prosecution of vehicles flouting pollution control norms,” said Ms. Chaudhary.

Imposing fines

The officer added that besides strict regulations at pollution hotspots, they have intensified prosecution at other congested corridors. “We are fining vehicles for improper parking, transportation of buildings material or uncovered material, Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate and old vehicles under the category of 10 and 15 years, across the city,” she said.

The second step is extra deployment at hotspots and congested corridor for better prosecution. They keep conducting encroachment removal drive at these locations to ensure smooth traffic flow.

“The third measure involves the officers formulating an action plan in coordination with civic agencies to minimise pollution at hotspots and busy corridors,” Ms. Chaudhary said.

Traffic policemen have also been instructed to follow social distancing guidelines during prosecution process.

EV policy

Among the highlights of the Delhi government’s battle against air pollution this year, is the recently announced Electric Vehicle policy under which incentives and benefits are extended to those buying electric vehicles, said Transport Secretary-cum-Commissioner Manisha Saxena

Additions to the city’s public bus fleet are expected over the coming months with both e-buses as well as low-floor vehicles to be added to Delhi’s State-run transportation infrastructure by the first quarter of 2021, which would yield long-term results towards the objective of mitigating air pollution, she added.

“As far as enforcement is concerned, we have been taking action against vehicles, both private and commercial, for visibly polluting, not having PUC certificates and overloading. A dedicated prosecution drive against such vehicles has been on since September and being carried out strictly,” Ms. Saxena said.

According to Transport Department data, as many as 3,72,409 vehicles were checked between January and October 22 this year. Of these, 10,733 were challaned for not having valid PUC certificates while 480 were issued fines for causing visible pollution. According to prosecution figures, as many as 1,397 vehicles were fined for pollution-related offences since the beginning of October.

Anti-smog guns

In neighbouring Gurugram, anti-smog guns at construction sites, a dedicated air monitoring cell, and night patrolling are some of the new initiatives taken by the Gurugram pollution control board to tackle the rising levels of pollution.

Speaking to The Hindu, Regional Officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, Gurugram (South), Shakti Singh claimed that 43 anti-smog guns were installed at several construction sites within his jurisdiction to control dust.

These machines, said Mr. Singh, could sprinkle water within a distance of 30 metre and help bring down the PM2.5 levels. Similarly, 22 similar guns were now positioned in Gurugram (North). Mr. Singh said there were 136 construction sites in Gurugram.

With the pollution levels fluctuating, the district administration has put into place the measures to deal with the severe category of pollution that includes ban on diesel generator sets, monitoring of open burning of the waste and mechanised sweeping of the roads.

Unlike previous years, an air monitoring cell has been set up at HSIIDC Office Complex in Manesar to redress any complaint related to GRAP violation with a toll free no. 1-800-180-1817.

The team at the cell also responds to complaints received on social media accounts of the department.

Besides, 45 devices are installed for monitoring of air emission in ‘red category’ industrial units and the real time data provided on the HSPCB and Central Pollution Control Board server for monitoring. Mr. Singh claimed that around 80% industrialists and builders had given undertakings to adhere to the GRAP.

Also, notice has been served to Farrukhnagar municipal corporation to ensure door-to-door collection of the solid municipal waste and curtail open burning of waste. However, as many as 22 residential societies, including two in the DLF area, depend, partially or wholly, on the diesel generator sets for electricity supply.

Besides, 40 commercial buildings also don’t have regular power connections from the grid. Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, Chief Engineer, Vineeta Singh, said that though the power department was prepared to impart regular electricity connections to these areas, the deficiency in terms of infrastructure and incomplete formalities was on the part of the developers. The EPCA had asked the Haryana government to submit a detailed programme to ensure supply to these areas before it considers exemption for them.

He demanded Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal immediately meet his promises made earlier to control pollution in the city and that allegations and counter-allegations will not solve the problem.

The Badarpur MLA said he had, in a letter, sought to remind Mr. Kejriwal that he had promised cleaning of roads with road-sweeper machines, installing smog towers and air purifiers in Delhi, and spraying water with helicopters, etc. to curb pollution.

“The time has come when the Delhi government should implement all these measures immediately,” he said, adding: “The Delhi government should ensure that roads are repaired, public transport system is strengthened, the fourth phase of the metro is quickly completed and flyovers are built to rid the city of traffic jams.”

Delhi’s AQI

The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram, and Noida continued to be in the “very poor” category on Saturday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. Delhi’s air quality is expected to remain in the same category on Sunday, as per government-run monitoring agency SAFAR.

The Air Quality Index of Delhi on Saturday was 345, and the values for Gurugram and Noida were 325 and 347, respectively, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin, which is an average of the past 24 hours. All three values are in the “red” category, and this level of pollution can cause “respiratory illness on prolonged exposure”.

Stubble burning fire counts in Haryana, Punjab and border regions of Delhi increased from 1,213 on Thursday to 1,292 on Friday, as per SAFAR.

The contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5 levels in Delhi was estimated to be around 9% on Saturday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shda9t/article23897319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16BIDHURI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/air-pollution-dampening-joy-of-festive-season-cm-must-act/article32937940.ece
175,2020/10/25,Chennai birder’s photo commended by London’s Natural History Museum,"Sambath Subbaiah’s photo won appreciation as part of Wildlife Photographer of the Year award in the Birds Behaviour category.

Their eyes are locked in fierce competition. Who will strike first? Chennai birder and wildlife photographer Sambath Subbaiah chanced upon a short-toed snake eagle and a rat snake in combat, in March last year at Senneri lake in Kanchipuram. He took out his camera to document the action and was rewarded with a series of images. One of them, that shows the bird and snake with their eyes interlocked, moments before striking, stands out: It was commended under the Birds Behaviour category in Wildlife Photographer of the Year award from London’s Natural History Museum, announced last week.

“This is a prestigious award and I’m thrilled,” says the 36-year-old who is an IT manager. It had started out as a regular day of birding for Sambath that day; he recalls heading to the outskirts of Chennai with his daughter and a friend. The sun was about to set and the light was falling when he saw them. “The five-foot long rat snake had coiled around the eagle’s tail and feet,” he recalls. It had seemed like the eagle was losing the battle.

Sambath Subbaiah | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

“It struggled,” says Sambath. By then, Sambath had begun clicking away his camera. “These are the kind of moments you dream of capturing as a photographer,” he says. “But it was challenging; it was almost 6.15 pm and the lighting was poor.” Minutes in, the eagle and the snake were about to strike each other at the same time. “The eagle won, of course,” says Sambath. After all, its main diet consists of snakes.

Sambath hopes that his award creates awareness on the importance of the grassland ecosystem. “As our cities expand at a drastic pace, we must remember to preserve our waterbodies,” he says. Grasslands around waterbodies, Sambath explains, are crucial for snakes to survive. “And snakes keep rats, that are pests for farmers, in check,” he says, adding, “If this chain is broken, the entire cycle will go for a toss.” Sambath adds that all these seemingly “small things, are interlinked” and contribute to climate change.

Another aspect that Sambath wants to highlight is that, while people travel thousands of kilometres to see and photograph wildlife, they often miss out on what is in their backyard. “There’s so much to explore locally,” he feels.

The photo won him the award, sums up Sambath, due to a combination of factors. The most important of them was simply “being at the right place at the right time.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/c0w5lh/article32929887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23mpWinningpic,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/chennai-birders-photo-commended-by-londons-natural-history-museum/article32939995.ece
176,2020/10/25,"Coronavirus | Trials of a dozen vaccines progressing, says Gagandeep Kang","The microbiologist says identification of the people who need it the most is going to be a challenge.

Of over the 300 projects around the world working towards developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, almost a dozen have gone through the first two stages of human testing and results of three projects are likely to be available by the end of the year, , said Dr. Gagandeep Kang, microbiologist and professor at the Christian Medical College, Vellore. This will also bring with it associated challenges like identification of people who need it the most and distribution, she said.

""We have never had a time before when so much work has been done so fast on so many candidates as in the last nine months,"" said Dr. Kang who is credited with pioneering work on an indigenous rotavirus vaccine. Every platform technology that can be used in developing vaccines is being used against SARS-CoV-2, she said.

""Vaccination programmes in India and developing countries around the world almost never gave vaccines to anyone other than children and pregnant women. If we now need to give vaccines to people identifying the ones who need it the most is going to be a challenge. Reaching out to them is the next challenge. Getting the vaccines made and distributing it is a challenge as well,"" she said during the virtual inaugaration of the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad's annual State meeting.

In the haste to make vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, a lot of pressure was put on vaccine companies and researchers to make the vaccines quickly. ""Fortunately for us, the researchers and regulators have resisted that pressure. This is very important for building trust in vaccines,"" said Dr. Kang, who was the first Indian woman to be elected as a fellow to the Royal Society, London.

Also Read 30 vaccine programmes under way in India: scientist

""We will start with the healthcare workers, and then with the elderly and those with comorbidites,, and then think about the rest of the population.""

The Indian vaccine industry has four candidates that are in the stage of human trials. ""We are very lucky that India has an outstanding vaccine industry, consisting of private players who despite the fact that they are private players, have been responsible for providing unimaginable service to public health in India because they make high quality and affordable vaccines. India's vaccine manufacturers provide almost 60% of the vaccines that are used for routine childhood immunisation in low and middle income countries,"" she said.

More studies will have to be done to generate strong evidence on the treatments that can work, she explained. ""Two large studies that were done have resulted in clear answers for certain kinds of drugs for treatment. One done in the U.K., called the Recovery Trial, showed us that steroids – dexamethasone - worked in decreasing mortality in patients with severe disease who were hospitalised.”

“However, if we look at other drugs - lopinavir, ritonavir - which were designed for HIV, they do not work as a treatment. Hydroxychloroquine, which was widely recommended as a prophylactic in India, does not prevent severe disease or mortality,” she said.

“We have preliminary evidence on remdesivir showing there may be some effect. But to define the size of that effect, we need more studies,"" she said. She pointed out that we should no longer be thinking about hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir or ritonavir, being used for patients with severe disease.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/4oxys7/article32704094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27TH-SCIGAGANDEEP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-trials-of-a-dozen-vaccines-progressing-says-gagandeep-kang/article32940432.ece

Government think tank Niti Aayog is looking at many reform ideas in the health sector, including aligning traditional and modern approaches for a ‘larger good’, it’s member (health) V K Paul said on Sunday.

Mr. Paul said the government is committed to strengthening the traditional system of medicine (homoeopathy and Ayurveda) as well as the modern system of medicine(allopathy).

“It makes eminent logic that the best of traditional medicine and best of modern medicine therapies be brought together for a larger good of people and there are ways of practising integrated medicine,” he told PTI.

Mr. Paul, pointed out that it has already happened to an extent, as yoga is now part of practice in several conditions like in hypertension.

“There is a scope to align these approaches for the larger benefit of society... as a think tank, we are looking at many reform ideas in the health sector, aligning traditional and modern approaches for a larger good,” he said.

Integrative medicine is an approach that combines modern medicine with alternative systems like Ayurveda and yoga.

178,2020/10/25,The Hindu Explains | How are mathematical models being used to predict the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?,"How does the India National Supermodel Committee arrive at its predictions on COVID-19 spread? Are they credible?

The story so far: The India National Supermodel Committee, constituted by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and consisting of mathematicians, computer scientists and medical professionals, recently announced that India had passed its ‘COVID-19 peak’ in September and that active infections by the SARS-CoV-2 virus would fall to a ‘minimal’ level by February. The conclusions were arrived at with the help of a mathematical model.

What is the ‘National Supermodel’?

When the DST said in May that it had convened a group to track the evolution of the pandemic, it viewed the ‘supermodel’ as one that would aggregate the ‘best of’ existing mathematical models, and hence the name. From February to March, when the relative numbers of infections were low everywhere in the world except China, scientists began estimating the beginning and the course of the pandemic in their countries through mathematical modelling. Using differential equations, that show how multiple variables, such as infections and deaths vary with respect to one another on different parameters, modellers try to estimate the fraction of the population which is infected at a particular point in time.

Comment | Has India passed the COVID-19 peak?

How are the predictions arrived at?

One of the models used is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, which divides a given population into three groups: ‘susceptible’, ‘infectious’, and ‘recovered’. Over time, the number of people in each group change. The number of ‘susceptible’ people is highest at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, since everyone who is not infected is considered susceptible in most cases. At this point, the number of infectious individuals is at its lowest. As time passes, the number of susceptible people decreases, the number of infectious people increases. This model assumes that at any given point of time, an individual in a defined population will be a part of one of these groups.

The model’s output is dependent on what is fed into it. In the early months, little was known about the incubation period of the virus, the reproduction number (how many people an individual could infect), how lethal it was, etc. These led to oversimplified projections.

With time, data accumulated and improved the models. In the absence of cold numbers, modellers are forced to draw assumptions — on how quickly the disease spreads, the varying susceptibility of adults as opposed to children, for instance — which are a mix of judgment and luck. A key differentiator in the ‘supermodel’ was that it purported to account for asymptomatics.

What are the major findings?

While the modelling committee was a seven-member group, a scientific paper describing the group’s work and published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research has only three authors — a physician, a mathematician and a computer scientist. The modelling exercise also attempted to hypothesise on what India’s caseload would have been in the absence of a lockdown, or if it were delayed by a few weeks or a month after March 23. The first lockdown came into effect on March 25. If there were no lockdown, the number of active infections would have peaked at 14+ million and the peak would have arrived by mid-May. “There was little qualitative difference between two lockdown timings of April 1 and May 1, 2020. This would have resulted in a peak between 0 and 5 million active infections by mid-June. If there was no lockdown, it would have resulted in more than 2 million deaths. The two lockdowns (April 1 and May 1, 2020) would have resulted in 0.5-1 million deaths. The number of deaths with current trends is projected to be less than 0.2 million,” the authors say in the paper.

Comment | Imperatives after India’s September virus peak

Is it credible?

The model’s declaration of India having passed its peak comes nearly a month after the reported date — September 17 — from when the national caseload started to decline. From adding nearly 90,000 cases every day in early September, India is now adding around 55,000 cases daily. It is not clear whether, or how often, the mathematical curve that shows the modelled rise and peak of the number of cases has been adjusted to fit the actual number of cases.

The authors say the model expects a decline and virtual extinguishing of the pandemic by February, on the assumption that existing guidelines on restricting public gatherings, wearing masks, etc., continue and no major mutations making the virus more infectious take place. The authors have relied on data from a popular, crowd-sourced database, ‘covid19india.org’, and acknowledge that “...the major limitation in their model was the non-availability of accurate data”. Officials from the Health Ministry have been non-committal about India passing the peak, but admit that mathematical models have their utility in terms of planning.

Coronavirus | September accounted for 41.53% of total cases in India

How have similar mathematical models of the pandemic fared?

The United Kingdom adopted a policy of not imposing movement restrictions, except on the elderly, and letting the virus run wild through the population to acquire ‘herd immunity’. This changed after an epidemiological model said that one in two Britons would die with such a policy. India, too, relied on a rudimentary model in April to estimate that the pandemic would die out by May 16 because of the first lockdown. Mathematical forecasts, unlike, say, climate modelling, once publicised, can influence behavioural change, and this affects the model’s prediction. It derives from a standard aphorism in statistics that “all models are wrong, but some are useful”. Independent critics have said such models, at best, lay out what could happen in the next two weeks and it would be foolhardy to foresee months ahead.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/eid36j/article32937634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JammuMarket,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/the-hindu-explains-how-are-mathematical-models-being-used-to-predict-the-dynamics-of-the-sars-cov-2-virus/article32937635.ece
179,2020/10/25,"The Hindu Explains | What explains India’s poor rank under the Global Hunger Index, and what are the solutions?","What is the main cause for high levels of child stunting and wasting in India?

The story so far: India has been ranked 94 on the 2020 Global Hunger Index (GHI), lower than neighbours like Bangladesh and Pakistan. The GHI showed that nearly 690 million people in the world are undernourished; 144 million children suffer from stunting, a sign of chronic undernutrition; 47 million children suffer from wasting, also a sign of acute undernutrition. The number of young children in India who are very short and thin, reflecting severe undernutrition, puts it alongside the poorest African nations, with some indicators showing actual declines over the last five years.

What is the Global Hunger Index, and what determines its ranking?

The GHI is an annual peer-reviewed publication by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. It aims to track hunger at global, regional and national levels. It uses four parameters to calculate its scores.

Editorial | No great escape: On India’s low rank on nutritional indices

One third of the score comes from the level of undernourishment in a country, which is the share of the population with insufficient caloric intake, and uses Food and Agriculture Organization data. The other three parameters are based on children under the age of five years. A third of the score comes from child mortality rate, which often reflects the fatal mix of inadequate nutrition and unhealthy environments. The remaining third of the score is based on child wasting, which is the share of children who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition, and child stunting, which is the share of children who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition.

These parameters use information from the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the United Nations, although all these international organisations draw from national data, which, in India’s case, includes the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS). There is always a time lag in such data, so the 2020 scores are based on data from 2015-19.

This results in a 100-point scale, with zero meaning no hunger at all. Countries scoring 9.9 and less are classified as having a low severity. A score between 10 and 19.9 is considered moderate, that from 20 to 34.9 is serious, and a score of 35 or more is alarming. These classifications are comparable over time, but the rankings themselves are not comparable, as the number of countries included in each particular year varies.

How does India fare on the different parameters in comparison to other countries?

In 2020, India falls in the ‘serious’ category on the Index, with a total score of 27.2. This is a definite improvement from the situation two decades ago, when it scored 38.9 and fell into the ‘alarming’ category. However, its scores are abysmal when compared to its peers in the BRICS countries. China and Brazil both scored under five, and are considered to have very low levels of hunger. South Africa is ranked 60 with a score of 13.5, indicating moderate levels of hunger. In the serious category, India stands with some of the poorest African nations, as well as its own South Asian neighbours, all of whom have better scores except Afghanistan. India is tied at the 94th rank out of 107 countries, sharing the rank with Sudan.

In terms of overall undernourishment, 14% of India’s population does not get enough calories, an improvement from almost 20% in 2005-07. The child mortality rate is 3.7%, a significant drop from 9.2% in 2000. Many countries fare worse than India on these two parameters.

Also read | India’s child mortality rate declined between 1990 and 2019: UN

India’s poor score comes almost entirely from the child stunting and wasting parameters. Almost 35% of Indian children are stunted, and although this is much better than the 54.2% rate of 2000, it is still among the world’s worst. Also, 17.3% of Indian children under five are wasted, which is the highest prevalence of child wasting in the world. There is no change from two decades ago, when it was 17.1%. In fact, the situation improved to 15% in the 2010-14 data period, but worsened again by 2015-19.

However, experts say this decline may also be partially due to vagaries in data collection. Hunger is a seasonal phenomenon in many parts of the country, with families dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods, facing lean periods based on the sowing and harvesting cycle. There are seasonality differences between NFHS’s third and fourth rounds, meaning that higher levels of wasting may have been seen in the fourth round, on which the latest scores are based, because field data was collected after a lean period. However, even the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (2016-18) shows the same 17.3% rate of wasting.

What is the main cause for such high levels of child stunting and wasting in India?

There is an interesting difference observed between child wasting in South Asia and the poorer nations of Africa, according to researchers. African babies are usually healthy at birth, but as they grow up into their toddler years, undernourishment starts to kick in. South Asian babies, on the other hand, show very high levels of wasting very early in their lives, within the first six months. “This reflects the poor state of maternal health, more than anything else,” says Purnima Menon, a senior nutrition researcher at the International Food Policy Research Institute. “To talk about solutions, we must recognise that this is the root cause. Mothers are too young, too short, too thin and too undernourished themselves, before they get pregnant, during pregnancy, and then after giving birth, during breast-feeding. It is more than a health issue, there are social factors like early marriage … If so many young women are starting their pregnancies so badly, then everything else you may do to help child nutrition later is like simply putting a band-aid on a serious wound.”

Also read | 68% of under-5 deaths in India due to child, maternal malnutrition

Almost 42% of adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 have a low body mass index (BMI), while 54% have anaemia. Almost 27% of girls are married before they reach the legal age of 18 years, and 8% of adolescents have begun child bearing in their teens. Almost half of all women have no access to any sort of contraception. These poor indicators of maternal health have dire consequences for the child’s health as well.

Poor sanitation, leading to diarrhoea, is another major cause of child wasting and stunting. At the time of the last NFHS, almost 40% of households were still practising open defecation. Only 36% of households disposed of children’s stools in a safe manner. One in 10 children under the age of five suffer from diarrhoea.

How do different Indian States compare?

The Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey shows wide variability across States. Almost one in three children in Jharkhand show acute undernutrition, with a 29% rate of wasting. Although this is the worst State by far, other large States such as Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka also have one in five children who are wasted. Interestingly, other States that usually fare poorly on development indices, such as Bihar, Rajasthan and Odisha, actually do better than the national average, with 13-14% rates of wasting. Uttarakhand and Punjab, along with several north-eastern States, have levels of child wasting below 10%.

In terms of stunting, Bihar performs the worst, with 42% of children too short for their age. Other populous States like Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh also have stunting rates just below 40%, and so does Gujarat. At the other end of the scale, Jammu and Kashmir has only 15% stunted children, while Tamil Nadu and Kerala are around the 20% mark.

What needs to be done?

Experts caution that there is no magic bullet. Food insecurity, poor sanitation, inadequate housing, limited access to healthcare — all result in maternal distress that leads to the kind of slow, chronic wasting seen in Indian children.

Comment | The double burden of malnutrition: need for urgent policy action

Although India has overall food security with record levels of foodgrain production in recent years, access to healthy food is still difficult for poor households. A recent study showed that three out of four rural Indians cannot afford the cheapest possible diet that meets the requirements set by the government’s premier nutrition body. Over the last five years, the Swachh Bharat Mission’s push for toilets for all and ending open defecation may have resulted in better sanitation outcomes which could reflect in better maternal and child health in the NFHS round five, which started collecting field data in 2018-19. The Integrated Child Development Services programme aims to provide food, primary healthcare and immunisation services to young children and mothers.

“There is no single solution. Every kind of household deprivation that makes life difficult for women needs to be dealt with.

The health condition of legendary Bengali actor Soumitra Chatterjee deteriorated to “very critical” on Sunday, doctors treating him at a private hospital here said.

The 85-year-old is not responding to treatment and his platelet count has dropped further in the last 24 hours, a doctor at the facility said.

“There is a deterioration in his neurological condition and he has very little consciousness. He is not responding to treatment. His condition is very critical,” a senior doctor at the hospital told PTI.

Asked whether the actor has gone into a coma, the doctor said the medical practitioners are “evaluating the patient’s current condition”.

It was learnt that the level of urea and sodium in his blood has further gone up.

The octogenarian’s COVID-19 encephalopathy has also deteriorated, he said.

Encephalopathy is a general term to describe a disease that affects the function or structure of the brain.

The actor’s age and comorbidities are a matter of concern for the doctors.

“His organs like lungs and heart are working well and his blood pressure is normal but his consciousness is a cause of concern,” he said.

The actor was admitted to the hospital on October 6 after he tested positive for COVID-19.

183,2020/10/25,Portuguese Grand Prix | Lewis Hamilton overtakes Michael Schumacher with record 92nd F1 win,"Hamilton becomes most successful driver of all time in race wins

Six-times world champion Lewis Hamilton became the most successful Formula One driver of all time in terms of race wins on Sunday with a dominant 92nd career victory at the Portuguese Grand Prix.

The Mercedes driver, who took the chequered flag a huge 25.592 seconds ahead of second-placed team mate Valtteri Bottas, had equalled Ferrari great Michael Schumacher's record 91 wins at the previous race at the Nuerburgring.

Victory, along with a bonus point for fastest lap, stretched the Briton's championship lead over Bottas to 77 points with five races remaining.

“You are re-writing the history books,” Mercedes told Hamilton over the team radio, with team boss Toto Wolff adding: “Lewis, 92. 92.”

“I owe it all to these guys here and back at the factory,” said Hamilton.

“It's just been such a privilege working with them,” added the Briton, who was joined on the podium by race engineer Peter 'Bono' Bonnington.

“Today was tough but it was all about temperatures.”

Dutch youngster Max Verstappen finished third for Red Bull at the Algarve circuit near Portimao that was hosting the country's first grand prix in 24 years.

Hamilton lapped all but the three drivers behind him but it had not looked so simple at the start when he dropped to third from pole position on a lively opening lap with occasional rain complicating matters.

Bottas, who had gone ahead, was then passed on lap two by McLaren's Spaniard Carlos Sainz, who had started seventh on the soft tyres, with the Mercedes pair struggling to get heat into the medium rubber.

Verstappen had meanwhile dropped to fifth after tangling with Racing Point's Mexican Sergio Perez, who pitted and dropped to last but recovered to finish seventh.

Bottas retook the lead on lap six as the tyres fired up, with Hamilton moving up to second, and stayed ahead until his team mate overtook him on lap 20 to lead for the first time since the opening lap.

Hamilton, whose father was at the circuit to see his triumph, reported cramp with seven laps to go but then proceeded to set a series of fastest laps.

“I could never have dreamed of being where I am today,” he said after his eighth win of the season and 71st since he joined Mercedes.

“I didn't have a magic ball when I chose to come to this team and partner with great people, but here I am and what I can tell you is I'm trying to make the most of it every single day.

“It's going to take some time to sink in. I was still pushing flat out coming across the line.”

Bottas said he just had no pace. “I was pushing hard but couldn't go faster,” complained the Finn.

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished fourth with AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly fifth.

Sainz was sixth with Renault's Esteban Ocon and Daniel Ricciardo eighth and ninth.

Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel took the final point for Ferrari.

184,2020/10/25,"Govt. to seek Parliament nod for ₹37,000-crore spending on infra development","The demand will be made through the second supplementary demands for grants.

The government will seek Parliament’s approval for ₹37,000-crore additional spending on infrastructure development in the second batch of supplementary demands for grant.

Earlier this month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced additional budget of ₹25,000 crore as capital expenditure (capex) on roads, defence, water supply, urban development and domestically produced capital equipment.

Besides, the central government approved issuance of a special interest-free 50-year loan to states of ₹12,000 crore for infrastructure development.

Approval for this additional spending will be sought through second supplementary demands for grants, sources said.

This was part of the third stimulus announced by the government earlier this month to boost demand during the festival season. The additional spending of ₹37,000 crore is over and above ₹4.13 lakh crore capex plan approved by the government in Budget 2020-21.

For various schemes of Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package, the government sought approval of additional spending through first batch of supplementary demands for grants last month.

The second supplementary demands for grants is usually presented during the winter session of Parliament.

The government has assured various infrastructure related ministries and departments that it will provide more money if needed and it is ready to provide the additional funds even at the revised estimates level, sources said.

Highlighting the importance of infra development, the Finance Minister recently said money spent on infrastructure and asset creation has a multiplier effect on the economy.

It not only improves current economy but also future GDP, she had said while announcing ₹37,000 crore extra spending for infra development.

Ms. Sitharaman last week exhorted central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) under coal and petroleum and natural gas to achieve by December 75% of their planned capital expenditure (capex) target for 2020-21.

This was the fourth in the ongoing series of meetings that the Finance Minister is having with various stakeholders to accelerate the economic growth amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

While reviewing the performance of CPSEs, Ms. Sitharaman had said capex by CPSEs is a critical driver of economic growth and needs to be scaled up for the financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22.

The government had pegged capex spending of ₹4.13 lakh crore for the current financial year, as per the Budget 2020-21.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mc1p80/article32839195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UPDATED-TH12-ViG0U7RQ2P63jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/govt-to-seek-parliament-nod-for-37000-crore-spending-on-infra-development/article32940094.ece
185,2020/10/25,Amazon wins interim relief; Future-Reliance deal put on hold,"Amazon believes Future Group violated the contract by entering into a deal with rival Reliance.

Amazon on October 25 won an interim award against its partner Future Group selling retail business to Reliance Industries for ₹24,713 crore after a Singapore-based single-judge arbitration panel put the deal on hold.

Amazon, which had agreed to purchase 49% of one of Future’s unlisted firms in 2019 with the right to buy into flagship Future Retail after a period of three years to 10 years, had dragged Future to arbitration after the indebted Kishore Biyani group firm signed pact to sell retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance.

Passing an interim award in favour of Amazon, V.K. Rajah asked the Future group to put the deal on hold and said that the deal cannot go through until it finally decides the matter, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.

Confirming the development, an Amazon spokesperson said that the arbitration panel has granted the relief sought by it and expect an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process.

“We welcome the award of the Emergency Arbitrator. We are grateful for the order which grants all the relief that were sought. We remain committed to an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process,” the Amazon spokesperson said.

Amazon believes Future Group violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.

The deal would have helped Reliance almost double its footprint as India’s largest retailer.

Meanwhile, commenting on the development, RIL retail arm Reliance Retail Ventures (RRVL) said it has been informed about the interim order passed by the emergency Arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings invoked by Amazon and it intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future group without any delay.

“RRVL has entered into the transaction for acquisition of assets and business of Future Retail Limited under proper legal advice and the rights and obligations are fully enforceable under Indian Law.

“RRVL intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future group without any delay,” said RRVL.

With the dispute, Amazon is drawing the battle lines with Reliance in the race for India’s estimated $1 trillion retail market, where online shopping is gaining ground. It needs the Indian partner to strengthen its foothold after becoming the authorised online sales channel for Future Retail’s stores that sell everything from groceries to cosmetics and apparel.

A source said a three-member arbitration panel, with Future and Amazon appointing one representative each and a third member being a neutral umpire, would decide on the dispute in 90 days.

Amazon team was represented by Gopal Subramanium, Gourab Banerji, Amit Sibal and Alvin Yeo. While Future Retail side was represented by advocate Harish Salve, sources said.

On October 16, the hearing was concluded by the arbitration panel at Singapore International Arbitration Centre.

Amazon has slapped a legal notice on Future Group, alleging that the retailer’s ₹24,713 crore asset sale to Reliance Industries violated an agreement with the e-commerce giant and dragged the Future group firm into arbitration.

On August 29, 2020, the Future group announced sale of its retail, wholesale and logistic etc to RRVL, the retail arm of the Reliance Industries.

In 2019, Amazon bought a 49% stake in one of Future’s unlisted firms, Future Coupons, with the right to buy into flagship Future Retail after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owns a 7.3% stake in Future Retail.

The tussle between Future and Amazon comes at a time when Reliance has been bolstering its position in the country’s retail segment.

Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd — run by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani — has been on a fund raising spree and since September, it has raised ₹37,710 crore crore by selling stake in its retail arm.

187,2020/10/25,IRDAI proposes changes to insurance advertisement regulations,"Unfair and misleading advertisements will include those which fail to clearly identify the product as insurance and describe benefits that do not match the policy provisions.

In a bid to protect consumers, regulator IRDAI has proposed to prohibit insurers from issuing advertisements that make claims which are beyond reasonable expectations of performance.

The unfair and misleading advertisements will include those which fail to clearly identify the product as insurance and describe benefits that do not match the policy provisions, the regulator said in the draft Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Insurance Advertisements and Disclosure) Regulations, 2020.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) is seeking to come out with new advertisement regulations and has invited comments from stakeholders on the exposure draft by November 10.

The objective of the proposed regulation, IRDAI said, is to ensure that the insurers, intermediaries or insurance intermediaries adopt fair, honest and transparent practices while issuing advertisements, and avoid practices that tend to impair the confidence of the public.

Another objective of the proposed regulation is to ensure that the publicity material is relevant, fair and in simple language, enabling informed decision making.

According to the draft, misleading advertisements will also include those which fail to disclose or disclose insufficiently important exclusions, limitations and conditions of the contract.

The illustrations regarding future benefits on assumptions which are not realistic nor realisable in the light of the insurer’s current performance, or deviate from the stipulation by the authority through regulatory provisions will also be treated as misleading advertisements.

While issuing the exposure draft, IRDAI said evolutionary trends in advertisements in the last 20 years, coupled with technological developments which have changed the medium of advertising, necessitate the review of existing advertisements regulations.

Some of the key changes proposed to the current regulations include modifying definition of advertisements and rationalisation of certain other definitions, enlarging scope of the term ‘misleading advertisement’, and putting onus for enforcing compliance on advertisement endorsed by third parties on insurers for compliance.

IRDAI (Insurance Advertisements and Disclosure) Regulations, 2000 were notified in 2000. Two minor amendments were effected in 2010 and 2015, respectively.

As per the draft, all insurance advertisements should ensure that “communications are clear, fair and not misleading whatever be the mode of communication. They should use material and design (including paper size, color, font type and font size, tone and volume) to present the information legibly and in an accessible manner”, among other things for clarity.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lxwzi0/article31214743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRDAIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/irdai-proposes-changes-to-insurance-advertisement-regulations/article32940276.ece
