0,2020/10/18,Police track down cook who stole safe,"They took a flight to Howrah and were at the station when his train pulled in

The J.P. Nagar police caught a flight from Bengaluru to Kolkata to catch a 35-year-old domestic help, who had allegedly stolen a safe containing valuables worth ₹1.3 crore from his employer. The accused, Kailash Das, is a native of Burdwan. He was arrested the moment the train pulled into Howrah station.

“The locker contained gold and diamond valuables as well as cash,” said a police official.

Das had been working as a cook in the house of Rajesh Babu in J.P. Nagar for six years, and resided with them.

Earlier this month, a family member contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalised. “While his relatives were busy taking care of him, Das stole the digital locker from their house and escaped on October 9,” the official added.

Das fled to Mysuru where he stayed in a lodge for two days and tried to break open the locker using a screwdriver. “But the screwdriver broke and got stuck in the keyhole. He then decided to go back to his native town. He returned to Bengaluru and caught a train to Howrah,” the official added.

Police saw CCTV footage of him boarding a train at Yeshwantpur railway station.

A police team got on a flight to Kolkata and reached the station ahead of him. The accused tried to escape on seeing the police, but was caught and brought back to Bengaluru with the locker on Saturday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-track-down-cook-who-stole-safe/article32887769.ece
1,2020/10/18,Tunnel Boring Machine Urja crosses 140 metres,"It was the first TBM to commence drilling work on July 30 under Phase II of the Namma Metro project

Nearly three months after tunnel work was commissioned, the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) christened Urja has drilled a distance of 144 metres from Cantonment Station towards Shivajinagar. It was the first TBM to commence drilling work on July 30 under Phase II of the Namma Metro project.

However, tunnelling work was temporarily stopped by the appearance of a sinkhole last week.

“The sinkhole has been grouted. Once it settles down, the TBM will resume work,” said a Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) official.

BMRCL has estimated that to tunnel a distance of 850 metres, the machine would take nine months. Another 706 metres of excavation work is required to achieve a ‘breakthrough’ at Shivajinagar. At the time of commissioning work, the BMRCL had maintained that the machine would drill through 250 metres of hard rock, 350 metres of mixed ground condition and about 225 metres of soil.

As per the plan, after Urja crossed over 100 metres of excavation, one more TBM named ‘Vindhya’ started the journey from Cantonment side. As on October 17, the machine has tunnelled a distance of around 18 metres. Vindhya will dig a parallel tunnel towards Shivajinagar.

B.L. Yeshwanth Chavan, Chief PRO of BMRCL, said that a third machine, ‘Avni’, which started tunnelling from Shivajinagar to Rashtriya Military School has resumed work after facing hurdles due to a sinkhole in Shivajinagar metro station construction area.

The official said, “The sinkhole problem has been fixed. The machine resumed work and proceeded to dig 11 metres. Once Avni crosses 100 metres, another machine, Lavi, will commence tunnel work from Shivajinagar.”

Under Phase II of Namma Metro, the BMRCL is building a 13.9-km underground line from Jayanagar Fire Station to Nagawara. An interchange station at Nagawara will be linked with the ORR-airport line that connects Silk Board with Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). The alignment has 12 underground stations and 10.37-km of twin tunnels.

For the rest of the reaches (Dairy Circle to Rashtriya Military School and Tannery Road to Nagawara), the BMRCL is expecting arrival of news TBMs in four months.

BMRCL has acquired 95% of the land needed for the project, but is facing hurdles at Langford, Lakkasandra and Rashtriya Military School.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tunnel-boring-machine-urja-crosses-140-metres/article32887450.ece
2,2020/10/18,Councillors oppose proposal to prune BBMP budget,"Officials say the COVID-19 pandemic had severely affected revenue

The civic administration’s move to prune the budget, presented in April this year, has raised the hackles of councillors and former councillors from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who are lobbying hard with the State government against the move. The civic administration has argued for a revision citing its necessity as the COVID-19 pandemic had severely affected the BBMP’s finances, a claim contested by former councillors.

Any revision of the budget will only result in the dropping of civic works, a prospect councillors, cutting across party lines, are not comfortable with given that civic polls may be held any day, depending on directions from the Karnataka High Court.

“On the eve of an election, which councillor or party would want civic works to be axed? Instead, we demand that the BBMP start the civic works announced in the budget,” a senior BJP councillor and party strategist said.

Gaurav Gupta, Administrator, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), told The Hindu that while efforts to present a realistic budget were on, it was premature to comment on the issue as a proposal to the effect is yet to be made.

L. Srinivas from the BJP had presented a budget of ₹11,969.5 crore for the current financial year, which the State government pruned by ₹254 crore. A budget of ₹11,715.2 crore was finally approved.

The BBMP has set a target of ₹3,538 crore from property tax, ₹4,339 crore from the State government and ₹2,316 crore from non tax-revenue, among other sources.

“The budget was approved by the State government just a few months ago. What are the grounds to prune it? We have taken up this issue with senior ministers, who have promised that there will be no revision of the budget,” Mr. Srinivas said.

However, senior civic officials said the budget was “unrealistic” in its revenue projections, which has only become more stark due to the pandemic and the resultant financial crisis. For instance, the State government’s grants are unlikely to come as promised, sources said.

When asked about the financial constraints, Mr. Srinivas said BBMP should award tenders and start civic works. “The civic body doesn’t pay the bills immediately. The pandemic must not be used as an excuse to deny development,” he said.

In the past, the civic budgets had come under severe criticism over variance between the estimates and actuals. Data from Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy shows it varies in the range of 25% to 40%. The only exception was in the year 2015-16 when the civic administration led by an administrator – now Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar – pruned the budget presented by the council to a realistic level. That year, the variance was only 3%.

“Councillors often inflate revenue projections, grant civic works themselves and start works, even as the BBMP falls short of revenue to pay contractors. This leads to a problem of pending bills, which undermines the financial health of the civic body,” pointed out a senior civic official.

A section of BBMP contractors had recently threatened to stop all ongoing civic works as pending bills had mounted to ₹2,500 crore for works that are as old as two years.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/councillors-oppose-proposal-to-prune-bbmp-budget/article32887424.ece
3,2020/10/18,CID officers target of cyber fraud,"Latest complainant is Prakash Rathod, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Financial Investigation Unit

Even the police can fall prey to cyber fraud. In the latest case, Prakash Rathod, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Financial Investigation Unit of the Criminal Investigation Department, has filed a complaint that online fraudsters created a fake Facebook account in his name and used it to cheat his friends.

After creating a duplicate fake profile with a photograph of the DSP in his uniform, the accused sent a request via Facebook Messenger to his friends seeking monetary help citing financial and emotional stress, with details of where the money could be transferred.

The incident came to light when one of Mr. Rathod’s friends transferred ₹2,000 online and then called up to confirm receipt of the money.

The CID cyber crime police are trying to track the accused based on the account details provided by Mr. Rathod. At least three other police officials have filed similar complaints in the past.

Inspector General of Police (training) P. Harishekaran, Deputy SP (CID) M. Humayun Naagthe and Special Deputy Commissioner (Bengaluru north sub-division) Jagadisha M.K. have filed complaints that fake Facebook accounts with their profiles were made by unknown persons who then sought financial help from their friends.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cid-officers-target-of-cyber-fraud/article32887288.ece
4,2020/10/18,Homebuyers stage protest at under-construction site,"The apartments were to be delivered in mid-2015

A group of over 50 homebuyers running from pillar to post to get delivery of their flats, which is allegedly overdue by five years, held a protest at the under-construction site on Hennur Road on Sunday. The homebuyers, who said that they had made payments in 2011, have approached several agencies, including Real Estate Regulatory Authority-Karnataka (RERA-K) and the city police.

One of the homebuyers, K.S. Franklin, said that 52 homebuyers had paid anywhere between ₹25 lakh and ₹90 lakh for a flat in 2011. “We were promised that the flats in Elegant Altis would be delivered by mid-2015. To date, not one flat has been handed over to buyers. Most of us have availed loans, for which we are paying EMIs,” he said.

RERA-K had ruled in favour of two flat-owners. In September 2019, the Authority has ordered the developer to not only pay the principal amount, but also penalty and interest. A similar order was passed a few months ago this year too.

“But it is shocking that there has been no implementation of the RERA-K order. Fed up with the state of affairs, we registered an FIR at Pulikeshi Nagar Police Station in July this year against the developer for cheating homebuyers,” Mr. Franklin said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/homebuyers-stage-protest-at-under-construction-site/article32887148.ece
5,2020/10/18,Huge dip in passport applications between April and mid-October,"From April to mid-October, 76,695 applications were received for various services, including issuing of passport

As most parts of the world came to a halt amidst a raging pandemic, the little blue book which is the passport to travelling abroad for work, studying and leisure has not been in much demand.

The usual volume of applications for passport and related services that the Regional Passport Office (RPO), Bengaluru receives in a year is in lakhs. But in a pandemic-hit year, despite functioning through the months where most other sectors were closed, the number of applications and final services given has seen a sharp dip compared to the previous year.

According to data shared by the RPO, this year, from April to mid-October, 76,695 applications were received for various services, including issue of passport. Of these, 76,523 were granted. The final number of passports issued during this period was 88,139. Another, 3,135 Police Clearance Certificates (PCC) and 17 Surrender Certificates (SC) were also issued.

During the corresponding six-and-a-half months last year, 4,24,804 applications were received by the RPO, of which 4,30,087 were granted. As many as 4,34,700 passports, 12,899 PCCs and 55 SCs were issued.

With international air travel shut due to COVID-19, and with stringent lockdown in place, there was no need for passports. In fact, the RPO had to reduce the number of appointments by half after a directive from the Ministry of External Affairs in March just before the first lockdown was announced as a precautionary measure. The RPO recently restored the number of appointments to normal after adopting the necessary precautionary measures, but only half or less than half the appointments are being taken.

In the last few years, the RPO has received over seven lakh applications for issue of passport and related services. Months of low demand this year is expected to have a telling impact on the final numbers this calendar year.

Regional Passport Officer Bengaluru Bharath Kumar Kuthati told The Hindu, “We can’t say with certainty, but the fact is, there is a steady increase in the number of applications.”

The RPO had mentioned that though the number of appointments taken has come down to around 50% from pre-COVID-19 times, it is still an increase in recent months from the 20% post the first lockdown to around 40% now. An overall fear of crowded places has also been cited as one of the reasons for applicants to stay away.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/qqgonq/article32887112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGPASSPORTP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/huge-dip-in-passport-applications-between-april-and-mid-october/article32887113.ece
6,2020/10/18,DRI seizes narcotics worth ₹13 crore in Bengaluru,"Hidden in photo frames and albums, the consignment was bound for Australia

In the biggest seizure this year, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) officers busted an international drug racket and recovered 13.2 kg of pseudoephedrine worth around ₹13 crore at Kempegowda International Airport on Saturday.

Pseudoephedrine, which is used in the production of various narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, is notified as a controlled substance under the NDPS Act.

The consignment was in Singapore en-route to Australia when officials, acting on a tip-off, recalled it back to Bengaluru. The order originated from Chennai and was being shipped via a private courier company, said officials.

This latest seizure comes barely three weeks after the DRI in Chennai had seized 25 kg of pseudoephedrine.

According to officials, the latest consignment was concealed in photo albums, photo frames, bangles and other personal items. It was hidden in a shipment that was meant to look like personal items for a family member in Australia, said officials. A closer examination of the items revealed that the substance had been hidden within the thick covers of the albums and photo frames. The market price of pseudoephedrine is over ₹1 crore per kilogram.

“This is one of the largest such consignments seized in recent times at the international airport and would have been sold in the international market for more than ₹13 crore,” said the DRI in a press release.

Australia connection

According to DRI officials, pseudoephedrine is becoming the main precursor chemical preferred in the manufacture of methamphetamine in Australia. Only 1.5 kg of pseudoephedrine is needed to obtain a kg of methamphetamine, said the release.

Australia has reportedly seen the introduction of imported crystalline methamphetamine over the past five years.

“Despite the pandemic, the total amount [of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine] seized by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence across India this year has already crossed 500 kg, clearly pointing to a mass diversion of the precursor drug to Australian markets,” said the DRI in the release.

“Crystalline methamphetamine, sold as crystal meth or ice, is manufactured in clandestine drug laboratories in Australia, and is a highly purified form of the drug that is recognisable by its translucent crystalline appearance. In recent times, there has been an ever-increasing number of novel cases that have been detected by enforcement agencies of attempted smuggling from India to Australia of both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine,” said DRI officials.

Officials cited two similar attempts to smuggle ephedrine out of India concealed within wedding invitation cards, bobbins and spools of thread.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/wac8xr/article32886932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGDRUG1P2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dri-seizes-narcotics-worth-13-crore-in-bengaluru/article32886937.ece
7,2020/10/18,Public resentment mounting along Bhima banks,"Residents vent out anger at politicians and administrative officials for failing to discharge duties during time of crisis.

“Why did you come to our village - To pose for television cameras or to listen to the flood victims’ sufferings? You should listen to the affected farmers to get to know about the actual situation on the ground,” lashed out a flood-hit farmer, who had taken shelter at a relief camp at Firozabad in Kalaburagi, at Revenue Minister R. Ashok when the latter visited the village on Friday.

The farmer was also fed up with the media personnel who encircled the Minister preventing him from interacting with the people. In the ensuing chaos, the farmer could not narrate his ordeal to the Minister despite his best efforts as the unheeding Minister had rushed to his car. The Minister made flying visits to a few other villages in the district to complete the formality and left for the next district to repeat the same.

In another incident on the same day, villagers at Honagunta attempted to attack a government official who visited the flood-hit village. The Kagina floodwaters had inundated over 500 houses in the village and destroyed essential commodities such as food grains. The villagers did not even have drinking water to quench their thirst. The officer who visited the village next morning somehow managed to escape from the wrath of the mob and sent a drinking water tank within an hour.

The Muttaga village on the bank of Kagina remained incommunicado for two days after all physical and telecommunication connectivity was cut off. The villagers had to spend the nights in fear on their rooftops as the houses were inundated and power supply was disrupted. “We survived eating biscuits and drinking floodwater. Nobody came to our help,” a woman vented her anger before journalists after the Kagina receded two days later.

Also Read Despite a lull in rain, floods keeping people on tenterhooks

These are a couple of examples of how the public anger is accumulating against the politicians and administrative officials who the people think, have failed to discharge their duties.

From the beginning of the floods, the political class, especially the ruling party, appeared to be more interested in Council polls and by-elections to two Assembly constituencies than addressing the people’s woes.

Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa did come to Kalaburagi, not to visit flood-hit areas, but to accompany Shashil Namoshi, the BJP candidate for North East Teachers’ cCnstituency of Legislative Council, to the Regional Commissioner’s office to file nomination papers.

Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, who is also the in-charge of Kalaburagi, has not paid a single visit to the flood-hit Kalaburagi. It was only after Congress leaders B.R. Patil and Sharan Prakash Patil criticised him that he clarified he was in home-quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. He, however, did make a trip to Sira, unmindful of the pandemic, to accompany his party candidate for filing nomination papers for the constituency that was going for polls.

The district administration appears to have woken up to the call a little late. For the first time after decades, the district was receiving incessant downpours this year. The floods were more gradual than a flash in nature and provided enough time for the administration to prepare to face an imminent challenge.

Yet, the administration’s initial activities were confined to cautioning people on the banks of Bhima and Kagina through media releases against approaching the roaring rivers than preparing them for mass evacuations.

Though discharge from Maharashtra increased to 1,23,000 cusecs on Wednesday and continued to increase further, the Kalaburagi administration swung into action only on Thursday after the inflow in Sonna Barrage crossed a whopping 5 lakh cusecs.

Deputy Commissioner Vijaya Jyothsna’s directions to the concerned Tahshildars to evict 148 flood-prone villages were not implemented till the floodwaters entered the villages.

The improper coordination between Maharashtra and Karnataka might have contributed its part for worsening the situation.

The apparent disinterest of the political class and the lack of preparedness on the part of the administration left the flood victims in a lurch. The people’s anger is justifiably manifested in violent reactions to the strangers in neat dress visiting their villages – be it the government officials or the journalists reporting ground realities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/6aes20/article32885556.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THKALABURAGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/public-resentment-mounting-along-bhima-banks/article32885557.ece

Tension gripped Cottonpet area on Sunday when a man armed with a knife attacked morning walkers and pedestrians, killing one person and injuring five others.

9,2020/10/18,"Over 8,000 visitors throng Nandi Hills on weekends","Number of tourists is reaching pre-COVID-19 levels, say officials who have extended timings to accommodate the visitors

Thousands of tourists are flocking to Nandi Hills on weekends ever since the popular attraction was reopened to the public on September 7. According to officials in the Horticulture Department, which manages the area, the number of visitors on Saturdays and Sundays is over 8,000, almost back to pre-COVID-19 levels.

“In the initial days after re-opening, the hill was open between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. But due to the increase in visitors, which was resulting in traffic jams, we were forced to extend the timing from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.,” said Gopal N., special officer at Nandi Hills.

Before the pandemic, over 10,000 people would visit Nandi Hills every weekend. ““Now that it’s the festive season and there are more holidays, we are expecting the number to increase,” he added.

To manage the crowd and ensure that precautionary measures are being followed, the Horticulture Department, along with the police, have assigned more personnel on the ground. “Five home guards, our staff, people from the gram panchayat and police personnel are involved in collecting fines from those who are not wearing masks or following social distancing norms,” said another official.

Pollution and plastic

Locals claim that the influx of tourists has resulted in an increase in pollution levels as well as garbage over the last few weeks.

Nandi Hills was free from waste during the lockdown. But now, people leave behind plastic all over the pristine hills,” said an official, who said that even though vehicles are checked, it is not feasible to monitor thousands of people daily.

To tackle the plastic menace, India Plog Run and the Horticulture Department along with a local resort have started organising awareness programmes and plog runs with the message ‘serenity with responsibility’.

Ramakrishna Ganesh of India Plog Run, who resides near Nandi Hills, said their aim is to create awareness on proper and effective disposal of waste. “When the hills were closed to the public, we collected around 2.5 tonnes of waste, mainly plastic. We want to maintain cleanliness, but it is not possible without community participation. Hence, for the past three weeks, we have been conducting frequent plog runs,” he said.

D.S. Kiran Kumar, a volunteer, said that many people have started bringing their own food after COVID-19. “Many tourists discard bottles and disposable boxes carelessly,” he said.

Eco-friendly vehicles

The Horticulture Department has decided to procure eco-friendly vehicles that can be used by the public at the hills.

Rajendra Kumar Kataria, Secretary, Agriculture, Horticulture and Sericulture, said a tender will be called soon. “We had trial runs with such vehicles and the results were positive,” he said.

Mr. Kataria said that once enough eco-friendly vehicles are on board, one of the two parking lots atop the hills will be closed. “The big parking venue will remain while the one located further up will be closed. We are in talks with the departments concerned to start shuttle services from the foothill to the top. We are getting a few acres of land at the foothill to be be developed as a parking lot so that the vehicle load on the hill can be reduced,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ye2r5d/article32882620.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGNANDIHILLSP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/over-8000-visitors-throng-nandi-hills-on-weekends/article32882621.ece
10,2020/10/18,‘Dip in daily tally due to decline in growth rate of testing’,"Jeevan Raksha has claimed that the number of positive cases appear to be going down on account of a decline in the rate of testing.

Is the decline in number of daily COVID-19 positive cases in the country due to a dip in the growth rate of testing?

Jeevan Raksha has claimed that the number of positive cases appear to be going down on account of a decline in the rate of testing.

While the daily COVID-19 tally in the country had come down from more than 92,000 to 72,000 over the last one month, starting mid-September, Jeevan Raksha’s Mysore Sanjeev pointed out that the period also saw a decline in the moving growth rate of testing. In August, the seven-day moving growth rate of testing was consistent in the range of 18 to 20%, which led to an increase in daily cases. However, between September 1 and October 10, the seven-day moving growth rate of testing halved from 18 to 9%, leading to a decrease in the daily cases.

“In a pandemic when Test Positivity Rate (TPR) of a region is above 5%, the number of positive cases will be directly proportional to the number of testing in normal conditions. Higher the qualitative testing, higher will be the positive cases and vice versa,” he said.

A fifth of the total COVID-19 cases across the world are in India. While the global COVID-19 cases are increasing, the trend is moving in the opposite direction in India, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hlpfyv/article31606395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUSKARNATAKAHASSAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dip-in-daily-tally-due-to-decline-in-growth-rate-of-testing/article32883702.ece
11,2020/10/18,COVID-19 cases in Karnataka predicted to touch 1 million by Nov. 12,"‘Karnataka’s Test Positivity Rate of 11.6% is second highest among 12 mega States in the country’

The number of COVID-19 positive cases in Karnataka is expected to touch one million by November 12, by which time the number of victims may reach 12,800.

These are among the predictions by Jeevan Raksha, an initiative of Proxima, a management consulting firm, with the support of Public Health Foundation of India. By deploying the Pandemic and Epidemic Management System to study COVID-19 trends across India, Jeevan Raksha made two forecasts for Karnataka during August and September, whose margin of error was 3%.

Karnataka’s COVID-19 positive cases, which increased from 2,19,926 on August 16 to 4,40,411 on September 12 and to 7,17,915 on October 12, is expected to touch 10,00,000 on November 12. Positive cases are likely to touch a million when India’s surge is anticipated to reach 92,35,000 on November 12 from 71,65,741 on October 12.

No. of deaths

Jeevan Raksha has predicted the number of deaths in the State to reach 12,800 by November 12 from the 10,314 on October 12. The number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Karnataka had gone up from 3,832 on August 16 to 7,067 on September 12 before reaching 10,314 on October 12. The accuracy of Jeevan Raksha’s earlier two predictions on the number of deaths were 93 and 92% of the actual. Across India, the number of deaths, which stood at 1,10,173 on October 12, is expected to reach 1,34,860 by November 12.

Jeevan Raksha’s convener Mysore Sanjeev said Karnataka’s Test Positivity Rate of 11.6% was the second highest among the 12 mega States in the country that also include Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal, which together account for 70% of the country’s total COVID-19 cases.

Claiming that the Test Positivity Rate in Karnataka has not reduced for the last 10 weeks, Mr. Sanjeev said this indicated that the virus was spreading faster and wider in the State.

“Based on the Critical Medical Infrastructure resource planning module of Proxima, Karnataka might require 22,500 oxygen beds, 16,800 ICU beds, and 11,200 ventilators over the next three to six weeks. The government needs to immediately examine the available resources,” he said.

Bengaluru on top

Bengaluru Urban, whose total COVID-19 positive cases crossed three lakh, now not only has more positive cases than Mumbai, but also the highest among all the districts in India.

Accounting for 8% of the total active cases in India, Bengaluru Urban’s total COVID-19 positive cases are expected to reach 4.2 lakh by November 12, leading to a demand for critical infrastructure, according to Jeevan Raksha. “Bengaluru Urban alone might require 13,000 oxygen beds, 10,000 ICU beds, and 6,500 ventilators in the next four to six weeks,” Jeevan Raksha’s convener Mysore Sanjeev said.

Apart from mobilising critical medical infrastructure, the authorities also need to mobilise competent and skilled medical professionals, having experience and expertise to treat the rising number of patients, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fizq9a/article32883675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGCOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cases-predicted-to-touch-1-mn-by-nov-12/article32883678.ece

The Central Division police on Saturday opened fire and arrested four men who were behind the murder of Manish alias Sarvottam Shetty, 41, on October 15. Police suspect underworld rivalry but are yet to ascertain the gang’s affiliation or motive behind the murder.

Manish was shot and then stabbed to death outside Duet Bar, which he owned, on Rest House Road in front of eyewitnesses. Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP, Central Division) M.N. Anucheth said that the accused were arrested based on evidence gathered from CCTV footage.

The accused have been identified as Shashikiran, Akshay, Ganesh, and Nitya. After tracking the four men to a lodge in Gandhinagar, the police took them to Barlane Cemetery, Hosur Road, to recover the machete that they had used. “While at the cemetery, Shashikiran and Akshay attacked the escort police in a bid to escape. The police warned them and later fired at their legs to stop them from fleeing,” said a senior police officer.

The two injured accused were later shifted to St. Philomena’s Hospital.

The hit on Manish was a well planned one, said police sources. The accused had been following Manish to gather details of his routine from his residence in Bhoopasandra to his workplace for more than a month.

Shashikiran is a habitual offender with several criminal cases pending against him. “The probe has revealed that the murder could be due to old rivalry, but further investigation is on to ascertain the exact reason and the person behind the murder,” a senior police officer said.

Police sources said they have reason to suspect that underworld operative Vicky Shetty was behind it. Shetty, believed to be operating out of Dubai, reportedly called up a Kannada news channel and owned up to the murder on Friday. The police are verifying whether the caller was indeed Vicky. “A close associate of his, Kishan Hegade, was murdered over a business rivalry in Mangaluru and the hit was allegedly financed by Manish. We suspect that in retaliation, Vicky engaged the four accused to eliminate Manish,” said a police source. Incidentally, the Udupi police, who arrested nine people in connection with Hedge’s murder, have not uncovered underworld links or Manish’s role in the hit.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/four-arrested-for-bar-owners-murder/article32883655.ece
13,2020/10/18,Hybrid aortic arch procedure done,"A team of doctors took a hybrid approach to treat two patients with traumatic aortic injury and thoracic aortic disease.

The patients — a 46-year-old police official who had suffered a tear in the aorta, a major blood vessel of the body, and a 55-year-old shopkeeper, who had earlier undergone aortic dissection, and had a residual dissection in the lower half of his body growing in size and causing severe pain — underwent the hybrid aortic arch procedure at the Madras Medical Mission (MMM).

According to a press release, the police official had sustained multiple injuries in a road traffic accident. He had multiple fractures of the ribs and a vertebra with spinal cord compression. The injury caused a tear in the aorta.

Anbarasu Mohanraj, senior cardiac surgeon, MMM, said traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta was a life-threatening lesion and occurred in 10 to 30% of fatalities from blunt thoracic trauma.

Delayed repair of traumatic aortic injuries have significant survival benefits and a much lower mortality rate when compared to early open repair, he said. Extensive surgery with the cooling of the body to 16 degree Celsius, stopping the blood supply to the whole body and replacing that part of the aorta with a synthetic graft was the routine treatment till a few years ago.

Ezhilan J., head, Peripheral Vascular Department, MMM, said hybrid procedures have come for the safe management of such complex cases. As a first step in the operation theatre, blood vessels supplying the brain, spinal cord and upper limb are bypassed, creating a landing zone for the stent to be deployed. After this, an endovascular stenting of the thoracic aorta is done in the cath lab (catheterisation laboratory).

The second patient had extensive surgery for aortic dissection in 2017. The ascending aorta and the arch of the aorta was replaced preserving his aortic valve. The residual dissection in the lower half of his body that could not be repaired in a single stage was growing in size to 80 mm and causing pain. He was treated in a similar way.

Both patients recovered and were discharged five days later, the release added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hybrid-aortic-arch-procedure-done/article32885025.ece
14,2020/10/18,HC dismisses criminal revision plea in unlawful assembly case,"‘CB-CID can probe affairs of Thirumurugan Gandhi if it has credible materials’

No force under the sun can prevent police from investigating into the affairs of May 17 Movement coordinator Thirumurugan Gandhi and finding out if he was being operated by international outfits. However, such an exercise need not be carried in a nondescript case booked for unlawful assembly, the Madras High Court has said.

Justice P.N. Prakash made the observation while dismissing a criminal revision petition filed by the Central Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID). The revision was preferred against the refusal of a special court for cases against legislators to order reinvestigation in the case booked for assembling at the Marina beach here on May 20, 2018.

Initial case

Initially, the Zam Bazaar police station had booked the case regarding the unlawful assembly, in violation of prohibitory orders, against Mr. Gandhi, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Vaiko and others. It was the prosecution’s claim that they had gathered near Kannagi statue to condole the genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka.

However, on July 9, 2019, Justice N. Anand Venkatesh of the High Court refused to quash many other cases booked against Mr. Gandhi and directed the police to investigate thoroughly as to whether he was only the face of a “larger net”.

Subsequently, the Director General of Police transferred all pending cases against him from local police to the CB-CID.

In the meantime, the unlawful assembly case got transferred to the special court for legislators since Mr. Vaiko had become a Rajya Sabha member. The CB-CID filed a petition before the special court seeking permission to conduct further investigation in the unlawful assembly case. Its plea was turned down on February 7 and hence the present revision.

Stating that the charge of unlawful assembly was too ordinary a case to permit further investigation especially when the Zam Bazaar police had already completed the probe and filed a final report, Justice Prakash said: “This court is at loss to understand as to what is there to conduct further investigation in a case which relates to violation of prohibitory orders.

Fresh FIR

“If the State has credible materials in hand to show that the accused had violated the prohibitory orders at the instance of LTTE or ISI, Pakistan or Lashkar-e-Taiba etc., they can straightaway register a fresh First Information Report under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967 instead of praying for further investigation in this nondescript case.

“No power under the sun can prevent the police from investigating into the affairs of Thirumurugan Gandhi and the persons behind him. Even a fresh FIR can be registered against him if the police have the material to show that he is being operated by forces inimical to India.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wtrbhk/article32885023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TH-LT-11MADRASHIGHCOURTVG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-dismisses-criminal-revision-plea-in-unlawful-assembly-case/article32885024.ece

16,2020/10/18,‘22.8% of all trauma is due to transport-related accidents’,"World Trauma Day observed at the Apollo Speciality Hospitals

World Trauma Day was observed at the Apollo Speciality Hospitals, OMR, on Saturday. During the event, a pledge was taken to keep roads safe and prevent accidents.

An awareness programme titled ‘The road to recovery’ was also held.

M. Ravi, ADGP, Tamil Nadu Special Task Force; N. Kannan, Additional Commissioner, Traffic; J. Kumaragurubaran, Managing Director, SIPCOT and ELCOT; and Suneeta Reddy, managing director, Apollo Hospitals Group took part in the event.

World Trauma Day is observed on October 17 every year to propagate the need of averting deaths and disabilities caused by accidents or trauma. According to data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Tamil Nadu ranks first in road accidents for the third year, with over 156 road accident cases per day. The State recorded 57,228 road accidents in 2019.

With statistics revealing that 22.8% of all trauma was due to transport-related accidents, ‘The road to recovery’ programme emphasised the importance of saving and protecting lives in the most critical of situations and the measures to handle and avoid trauma fatalities.

Ms. Reddy said that while the pandemic has spread to 188 countries or regions across the world, road accidents affect more people than COVID-19 does. “This day is a call to action to build robust measures to avoid disability and death caused by road accidents. Quality emergency and trauma care is essential to save lives; the damage from trauma can be prevented with quick and early medical intervention,” she said.

17,2020/10/18,Extend deadline for property tax: Stalin,"Decision of the Corporation to impose fine is unacceptable, says DMK president

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday urged the Greater Chennai Corporation to increase to 45 days from 15 days the time given to pay the half-yearly property tax.

“On the one hand the Corporation announces 5% incentive for those who pay the tax within 15 days and on the other hand seeks to impose a 2% fine from the 16th day. It is like giving with one hand and taking away with the another hand,” Mr. Stalin said in a statement.

The DMK chief said that at a time when people were going through untold sufferings and activities have come to a standstill, the decision of the Corporation to impose fine was unacceptable.

21,2020/10/18,Officials in talks with residents to open water inlets of Korattur lake,"Inflow channels were blocked after citizens’ group moved NGT to prevent flow of sewage

The Water Resources Department is holding talks with citizen groups and residents’ associations seeking their cooperation in allowing rainwater to flow into the Korattur lake this monsoon. The move assumes significance as the residents had moved the National Green Tribunal seeking to prevent sewage flow into the lake. Consequently, the department plugged all the inlets carrying water to the lake.

In a bid to prevent water-logging in areas around Korattur lake, the department has completed 90% of the work to desilt inlet channels. However, residents raised concern about channels carrying sewage from areas such as DTP Colony.

One of the major waterbodies in the western part of the city, the lake is spread over 600 acres. The restoration project was taken up nearly five years ago and the work is still on.

Officials said various channels bringing rainwater to the lake, including Pattaravakkam canal and those along DTP Colony and North Avenue, are being cleared of silt and vegetation to ensure free flow of water.

The department is awaiting a government order to implement permanent measures, including regulators, to divert excess flow or entry of sewage. “We are making temporary arrangements such as placing sandbags near the bund and inlets to allow rainwater to flow into the lake at a certain height. But a decision would be taken after the talks with residents and citizen groups,” said an official.

Korattur Aeri Padhukappu Makkal Iyakkam (KAPMI), a citizen’s group involved in protecting the lake’s environment, had moved the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal to safeguard the waterbody.

KAPMI recently represented to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board seeking permanent steps to arrest of sewage flow and construction of a treatment plant.

KAPMI secretary S. Sekaran said the inlet channel along the DTP Colony continues to carry domestic sewage. The department must ensure that only rainwater flowed into the lake if the inlets were to be opened this monsoon. “We have sought that the height of the weir [a structure that allows surplus water to flow out] to be increased to store more water,” he said.

Officials said the water quality in the lake saw an improvement last monsoon when inlets were opened. Various government agencies, including the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewage Board, were implementing short-term and long-term action plans in a phased manner, they added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/p78x47/article32884078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THKORATTUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/officials-in-talks-with-residents-to-open-water-inlets-of-korattur-lake/article32884079.ece

Start new ventures across the State

It was heartening to read that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has signed 14 memorandums of understanding involving investments to the tune of ₹10,055 crore. For the overall growth of the State, the new ventures and expansion programmes should be spread evenly across the State and not confined to the Chennai region alone.

If more number of industries are established in the southern districts and in all other Tier II and III cities and towns, educated youth need not move to the Chennai region for jobs. Also, there is no doubt that the economy in these lesser-developed districts will improve to a great extent.

25,2020/10/18,Wind in the face,"Pedalling on in Bhuj with nary a care as initial apprehensions vanish

Love stories are overrated and cheesy. But love and logic are at loggerheads when you are in love.

I have always been in love with cycling. Arms lifted at the sides, head held high, and nostrils sucking in the soft breeze, every ride down the slope was like a take-off. But after marriage, this love took a back seat. Not that I was not allowed, but because the circumstances were not favourable.

Married to a soldier posted in inhospitable areas, I was compelled to curb my carefree spirit. And the only indulgence I had was an occasional ride that I could manage when my husband was available.

About 18 months ago, we moved to Bhuj in Kutch. The great thing about Bhuj is its traffic-free smooth roads. Whether it’s a town or village, the roads are a welcoming paradise for bike-lovers.

So what was I waiting for? There was another obstacle, one which many women cyclists will relate to. Leaving my five-year-old daughter unattended didn’t seem right and once again, I had to quell my desire to ride. And then there was also that fear of the unknown: should I or should I not ride alone?

""A woman riding alone invites unnecessary attention,"" a friend objected.

""I don’t think so, people here seem calm and civilised,"" I retorted.

""Oh, but they stare at you.""

""Yes, because they are curious. There is a difference between staring and leering,"" I defended.

For the past three months, going on occasional rides with my husband, I had noticed that the local people were decent and well-behaved. Now I wanted to break free from dependence on my husband.

""And what if your cycle breaks down?""

I laughed. I realised that there is no end to excuses. We all hide behind these excuses to justify our failed dreams.

Now was the time.

The next day, after my husband left for office and daughter for school, I wrapped up the household chores, packed my mini-breakfast and geared my bike. How much time did I have? Five uninterrupted hours. Not bad!

There is a smooth highway that connects Bhuj with the Mandvi beach. I decided to take this road, as it is not too isolated. It is a smooth road that passes through acres of barren land dotted with cacti and Kikar with just three or four villages.

I began my solo ride. My stomach lurched every time I thought that a car was slowing down next to me. I would imagine next day’s scary newspaper headlines, and in apprehension, my hand would move swiftly to the pepper spray tucked inside my jersey. For the first 20 km, I was as restless as a teenager on her first date. With narrow, suspicious eyes, I would scan the smiling faces I passed. Rudely, I ignored their cheerful waves. I was on guard.

Halfway, I stopped at a teashop. I noticed the stall owner watching me with curiosity as I wiped the sweat off my face. I avoided his eyes.

And then I smiled at him, a carefree, candid smile.

""Hiren Bhai,"" he introduced himself. ""Are you an NRI?""

""No, I am from Bhuj.""

""I’ve never seen a woman cyclist here, only some men cyclists on Sundays.""

Three or four villagers had joined us and they were inspecting my bike.

""You must be tired; here, take the key to my room and freshen up,"" Hiren Bhai gestured towards a room in the backyard. With a smile, I took the key to the bathroom. When I returned, he had prepared two glasses of masala buttermilk for me.

As I was about to leave, he took out his notebook. ""Here, can you please write something for my daughter,"" he asked me hesitantly. ""I will tell her that I met a woman cyclist.""

My heart had never felt that light and happy when I at last touched the sea after about 65 km riding alone on that highway.

That was the first of my many solo rides in Bhuj. And every ride was an enriching experience. It not only broadened my understanding of the local culture but also gave me a strong sense of self. Gradually, I have begun to sense a change around me. In our social gatherings, women approach me, not for advice on new fashions or a recipe but about my riding plans. Yes, it is doable. For me and for everyone.

More than the beautiful handicrafts of Kutch, the real beauty lies in its people. It also taught me that a city is not called civilised by the standards of its sophisticated technology but by the healthy mind of its dwellers. Be it a shepherd or a shopkeeper, everyone has a honest warmth. They are welcoming and free of any unhealthy gender-prejudice towards women.

On my rides, I have often met interesting people. There is a temple on a hill, about 10 km from the city, surrounded with an expanse of Kikar forests. There I had met an old widow who brewed tea for us and told about her life story, how she left her sons and chose to live here as the caretaker of the temple. I often think about her living all alone in that remote temple, her courage leaving me intimidated.

Inspirations are all around us, the world is full of stories. Once a week or so, I go for breakfast rides till Praveen Bhai’s dhaba on the Bhuj-Mandvi highway. He is fond of selfies and chit-chats. The last time, he told me the story of the crocodiles in the lake next to his dhaba.

With each ride, my apprehensions have become fewer and I no longer feel vulnerable or an outsider in this land. I am a person in love with her surroundings and with herself. At last, I am free.

26,2020/10/18,Tough learning,"Understanding the pandemic is as difficult as it was once for us to understand our books.

Once upon a time pupils went to ashrams to learn and become wise. We went to school. Our only source of learning were books as interpreted by our all-knowing teachers. By today’s logic, books were the stored data and teachers were the devices to transfer these to us.

There was also a black board, chalk, and a stick too to aid in the transfer of that data. The stick was feared but much more feared were the teachers who never used it! Those teachers were also our favourites.

One such noble soul taught us both mathematics and science and was liberal in his use of local words and phrases that sank in deeply. Many a times, he would address us as Arbi ke patte (taro leaves) and then he would ask us about a special characteristic of these leaves and go on to expound that just as not a drop of water sticks to them, nothing stuck to us too and that howsoever hard he tried, we understood little. He called us Dheeth too.

When I looked for an English word for Dheeth, someone told it was ""immune"". I got a vague idea that if you were Dheeth to a disease, you were immune to it and safe. Meanings that got associated with certain words at that stage of learning stayed with you for a long time and it took me a decade to know the difference between immune and insolent. We had no access to the dictionary; a copy in the school library was in the perpetual possession of the English language teacher.

It was in the medical school that immunity had to be learnt in terms of antibodies and lymphocytes. I became acutely aware of the word Dheeth again as the details were really vast and I felt like Arbi ke patte once more.

Why I remember all this is the current liberal use of the word immunity. We all are born with our ""innate"" immunity, and the ""acquired"" one is developed by our body over time. At present, challenged by a virus, we are susceptible to it because we lack immunity to it. We are not Dheeth to it; worse if we do not follow the simple advice to wear a mask and maintain physical distance.

The pandemic has kept the merchants of snake oil in check. A yoga guru who came out with a herbal concoction to counter the virus was allowed to market it as an immunity booster only. Taking a cue from it now, all herbal preparations are touted to boost immunity. Whether immunity will develop from such products is a moot point but these claims and promotions may help in boosting the economic activity.

Understanding the scourge is as difficult as it was once for us to understand our books and finding some English words. Today, long since the times of ashrams and old-time schools, we live in a digital world but still behave as Dheeth. But this virus is behaving more Dheeth than us only because we are also behaving so. To survive this challenge, we can no more afford to live like Arbi ke patte in not following the common sense advice to maintain physical distance and wear a mask.

27,2020/10/18,Memories in indelible ink,"Even an unimpressive ink pot takes us back in time

Filling a newly bought fountain pen with ink, I instinctively pulled the ink pot close to my face to see how it smelled. A distinct metallic flavour hit me, with a tinge of nostalgia similar to what yellowing old letters evoke. But most of all, the aroma was true ""royal blue"" that the label called it out to be, and a welcome change from the hand sanitisers that tantalise you with scents of alcohol that you can touch but cannot consume!

They say fragrances can bring back memories, but I least expected an unimpressive ink pot to take me back in time.

When I was first allowed to use a pen, ink could be your best friend and most formidable enemy at once — leave a pen’s cap off and you would be left with stained clothes. Or put a fountain pen in your mouth while struggling with a particularly perplexing maths problem, and you were left with more than one ""blue tooth"".

And yet, the ink pen was the very first pen that any of us was ever allowed to use at school. I still remember spending a princely sum of money buying my first Hero pen as was my family’s tradition, and then spending considerable time and effort understanding how to refill it.

I wrapped my first pot of ink in multiple plastic sheets before putting it in my school bag, having been warned of the consequences of a leaking ink pot by my mother. But holding that pen and finally being allowed to use ink for the first time thrilled all of us, and I made several failed attempts to improve my handwriting. And then came the sense of achievement when I found ways to add more ink to the pen than my friends could; such were the simple joys of those pre-teen days.

In many ways, the transition to ink pens from pencils was the school’s way of welcoming us to the real world — a bunch of pre-teens who had just entered the much hallowed fifth standard. We were the senior-most students on the junior side of the school, even if we couldn’t knot a neck tie. It didn’t matter, because we were finally allowed to write exams and pretend to solve maths problems with ink, which with hindsight, was the first time we were made aware of the consequences of our actions. No erasers would come to the rescue, and the shortest moment of carelessness would be punished with messy clothes and notebooks, and stern scoldings by teachers and parents. But the most humiliating part was facing the class and acknowledging that you didn’t know how to use an ink pen, a corollary of which was that you were not mature enough to be a pre-teen.

Today, I can type away on a keyboard at an extremely envious typing speed. But typing isn’t the same as writing, and the feeling of actually ""penning"" my words on paper eludes me. Modern technology and cheap manufacturing have taken ink pens out of fashion. But simply holding one in the hand, gives the mere act of scribbling even gibberish a very regal aura, and I still spend a lot of time going through the latest fountain pens.

The pen is often said to be mightier than the sword, though one wonders how true that is in the Internet age. But the ink pen shall always be mightier than the keyboard! Few could put it better than Lord Byron: ""A drop of ink may make a million think."" For me, ink shall continue to be the medium through which my soul jumps in joy and bleeds in pain.

28,2020/10/18,The ‘difficult’ patient,"The doctor-patient relation grows slowly which cannot be matched by money or rewards.

During the BC (Before COVID) era, the outpatient department of neurology in our hospital was a busy place with patients thronging its every nook and corner. The doctor, on the other hand, possessed only a table and a chair as his own.

As a first year resident, I was usually among the first doctors to attend the OPD. Around six months into my residency, I started to notice an old man among the first patients sitting right in front of my table. He looked cunningly cheerful and always flaunted a bright smile exposing his dentures.

As soon as I took my seat, he would give his opening statement, ""Why are you late doctor? We were waiting for a long time."" This was appreciated well by the audience around, by their smiles and giggles, elevating him to the status of a common man’s hero who had the steel nerves to question authority. I would find myself in a pickle, failing to find a comeback that is strong enough to win the argument and soft enough not to ruffle his feathers.

During history-taking and examination, he would go about telling his experiences here. After I make the diagnosis and prescribe medicines, he would yield his killing blow, ""Doctor, have you prescribed costly medicines that are not available here?"" This would again be rewarded with giggles and nods.

This was a common practice during his monthly visits. I would always reply to his taunts with a helpless smile, but the cauldron was boiling inside. When the first patient of the day destroyed you, it was usually difficult to continue the day on a high note.

After the floods that wreaked havoc in Kerala, when the OPD was slowly regaining its strength, I kept searching for this old man among the patients. I wondered what had happened to him and whether he had relocated. I started looking for the man who had teased and irritated me, but deep inside, I missed his smile. I understood a doctor-patient relationship was born during the chaos.

It was about two months later that I again saw him, a sight which filled in me with so much joy that I felt his teasing was as harmless as that between friends pulling each other’s legs. He was keeping well but had to miss the appointments for personal reasons. After his routine medications were written and before he could speak, I answered with a grin, ""Yes, all these medicines are available here.""

The unforgettable day came soon after during our usual chit chat. He said, ""Doctor, I come early because I want to see you and not any senior doctor. I am satisfied only after I see you and talk to you."" The audience heard it, was astonished and their head nods had less vigour. That day was an eye opener for me.

A patient whom I once disliked, whom I considered irritable actually loved me a lot as a doctor. I understood that the doctor-patient relationship is a sophisticated slow-growing love which cannot be matched by money or rewards. Such relations have become sparse in this time due to unnecessary tangles of greed, legality and consumer mentality.

I now understand that though his teeth were artificial, his smiles were truly from the heart with an icing of warmth and love. Though I frantically search for his face in the OPD during these COVID times, I am sure he will survive this pandemic and once again greet me with his smile and dentures.

29,2020/10/18,Bookless in the desert,"If reading is your very breath, how to survive in a bookless world?

When I was two years old, my mother read aloud to me from a brightly coloured book, Danny the Donkey. From that moment on, I was hooked to books. It was the start of a lifelong love. It was no surprise that my favourite poem in childhood was John Wilson’s Oh for a book and a shady nook…

My relationship with books and reading grew into a deep commitment that was to thrive through sickness and health and for better or worse, until death do us part. Or so I thought.

My worst nightmare of living in a world with nothing to read came true when I moved to Saudi Arabia with two toddlers to join my husband who was working there. It was a small town, where one could dash out and buy a washing machine, a dishwasher, a music system and a car all on the same day, but not a book. Bookstores and libraries were non-existent, and the daily newspaper was not home-delivered.

I was busier than I had ever been but could find time to read when the children had their nap. But there was nothing to read. I was miserable and dejected, homesick and bookless.

Striking gold

One afternoon, when the toddlers were asleep, I climbed on a stool to dust the top of the giant refrigerator provided by our landlord. As I swiped wildly with my duster, I struck gold! My duster brought down clouds of grey dust and also an old copy of a magazine. Dusting abandoned, I descended from the stool and picked it up reverently. It did not have its cover, the pages had yellowed and it was five years old. I skimmed through it, and my heart filled with joy. It was a treasure trove of articles, stories and anecdotes. It fell from the top of the fridge, but to me, it was a blessing straight from heaven.

Until we could explore the town and find a bookstore which eventually we did, I saved up this precious gift by reading a small portion of an article each day or just a tiny little anecdote at the bottom of the page. Sometimes, I read aloud to the toddlers too.

That old magazine was my beloved companion through those difficult times. I had come to live in a desert and found an oasis.

Now 36 years later, when I recall those days, I say a silent thank you to that magazine for giving me so much joy.

30,2020/10/18,Fighting the fuzz,"It was a magnificent obsession of British plantation officials in Munnar during the 1960s

To shave or not to shave is strictly a matter of personal choice. However, back in the 1960s, when I worked for a British-owned tea major in Munnar, it wasn’t. My prim and proper British bosses were sticklers for a daily shave and expected their assistants to follow suit. Coming to work unshaven was unthinkable to them.

Indeed, the Brits’ faces reflected their regular tryst with the razor. One boss’s daily shave vividly showed up the purple-hued network of veins in his cheeks in all their filigree-like detail. Another’s face, though always satin-smooth, was marred by a prominent scar under his chin, probably a reminder left by a carelessly wielded razor. Yet another had a ruddy countenance that was as hairless as his cranium — he eccentrically shaved his eyebrows too!

The company’s top executive, an irascible Scotsman, was particularly allergic to an unshaven face — it did raise his hackles. When one wished him in the morning, he would critically eye one’s face for any signs of telltale stubble. And if there were, his disapproving grimace eloquently said it all. I once heard him snap at a stubbly faced junior executive, “Your face is the index of your mind — keep it presentable always!”

Not a priority

For us youngsters, a daily shave then wasn’t a priority. In fact, many of us lacked sufficient facial hair growth to warrant a daily shave. But not wanting to displease our British bosses — and ruin our chances of rising in the hierarchy — we fell in line, perfunctorily scraping the fuzz off our mugs every day. And late-risers would rush to a salon en route to the office for a quick shave rather than risk annoying the boss early in the morning.

Once a British boss had a “close shave”, figuratively speaking. He gashed his face badly while shaving and turned up with a plastered cheek. I asked him what had happened. While shaving, some lather had slipped into his sniffer and he had sneezed violently, forgetting to move his razor out of harm’s way! It was a pointer for me too, prone as I was to sneezing while shaving. As for the boss, unable to shave, he grew hairier and more miserable each day!

Another British boss was a finicky daily shaver whose domestics, incidentally, never dared to appear before him unshaven — even if it meant being late for work. Once he was hospitalised for varicose vein surgery and I went to visit him, confident of catching him, for once, dishevelled and hirsute. But I was pleasantly surprised. I found him propped up in bed, well groomed — his cheeks as smooth as velvet. I learnt he had insisted on shaving himself every day. And since he couldn’t move about, he did so in bed — with an attendant holding a mirror and handing him the shaving kit!

For some, a daily shave may be an avoidable nuisance. But for many others, appearances do matter, making it an indispensable ritual come what may.

31,2020/10/18,Joe the plumber? No,"He was a thief, but one with a conscience

Long before I had the wit to identify and employ full-time help, I was blundering about alone at home nearly full-term with my first child and trying to manage both a blistering Madras summer and a tap that would neither turn off or on. A steady trickle called for a plumber. So when my husband said that he had arranged for a plumber to come by, I waited optimistically for the solution to my problem of the week.

Those days, the locality we lived in was so silent that you could hear cars turning in from the main road and the call of the sellers of spinach or kolam powder some minutes before they appeared. It was a time of visiting knife-sharpeners, bakery boys, soothsayers and sellers of ribbons and balloons and home-made toys. They all made their fortnightly calls. Rather sooner than expected, the doorbell jangled through our first floor flat and I went downstairs as fast as my unborn daughter allowed, and opened the door.

A tall, well-built and efficient looking man presented himself. Ah the plumber! “Come upstairs, come upstairs,” I said as I conducted him up to the flat and into the house leading the way to the bathroom.

He was so silent that I wondered whether he had grasped my feeble Tamil. “Look, this is the problem,” I said, pointing to the offending tap. He bent over it and straightened up. “Well, I can fix it but I will need some money to buy a new washer.”

“Of course, wait here.” In full view of the stranger, I opened the cupboard and drew out my last big note and handed it to him. “You’ll come back soon, won’t you?”

He left saying, “Half an hour. An hour at the most.” I went back to cleaning the kitchen when the phone rang. Another clumsy gallop through the hall! It was my husband. “We are in luck. The plumber is free. He’ll be along shortly.”

“But he’s already been here and will return with the washer he needed to fix the tap,” I replied. “I gave him some money.”

“But that was not our plumber.” “Then, who was he?

When I considered how easily that silent visitor might have knocked me on the head before removing my bangles, I thank my stars. Evidently the “plumber” had had an attack of conscience and left with just the money he did not have to earn.

32,2020/10/18,Unkindest cut-offs,"In this time of results and admissions, harsh words can scar children for life

What will our children say of us? As parents, do we encourage or exasperate them?

A seasoned speaker once recounted a slice of life from his teenage years. His father would drive him and his brother once a year through the campus of the Indian Institute of Technology in Chennai famous for its wildlife. “Look at those deer. If they write the JEE [Joint Entrance Examination for admission to the IITs], they will score higher than you,” the father would tell the siblings.

The drive through the campus was to inspire the boys to get admission to the premier institute. However, one of them took another path and did extremely well in the field he chose for himself. Being a well-known speaker, he was invited to preside over a function on the IIT campus. Calling up his father, he enquired, “Appa, do you know where I am invited to speak today?”

On a casual walk in a park, I came across a woman and her daughter taking a stroll. After exchanging pleasantries, I asked why the girl looked so despondent and miserable. The mother said, “Her father is angry that she did not score high in the NEET [National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for admission to the medical course]. He is furious and was scolding her.”

The girl looked so downcast that I feared she would do something unwise. The sorrow etched on her face is still hard to forget.

Seared into memory

Harsh or sarcastic words linger long in one’s memory. So do kind words. Once at a college function, a doctor said he did not get through the medical entrance test the first time and had to sit for it another year. He recalled how his mother told him, ‘I’m glad I can spend a year with you at home.”

Some 30 years later, the doctor recounted those words to his audience. Surely, the kindness of his mother left a mark in him. A woman told me how the family was in turmoil after her son got into a college but was disgruntled with the course he signed up for. He showed his discontent by skipping classes, much to the anguish of his parents. Finally, she and her husband told the boy, “Choose whatever stream you want. We are there to back you.”

Eventually, the boy settled down in a stream of his choice and did exceptionally well. I can only imagine how when he looks back, he will remember with gratitude the way his parents stood behind him as pillars of support.

The family should be a place where the child is trained to handle unnecessary comparisons and hurtful remarks from others. While it is hard to change government stands on educational policies, we can surely change how we talk to our children. We can lift them up, encourage them and give them hope with our words. Surely their worth is not defined by how much they score in exams.

As parents, we must toe the fine line of inspiring them and prodding them on to achieve their full potential, yet without exasperating them. It is tough to strike a balance between the two.

As we meander through the path of purposeful parenting, let us pause to consider the words we use with our children.

33,2020/10/18,"The Hindu Explains | What explains Nadal’s dominance on clay, Federer’s mastery on grass and Djokovic’s power on a hard court?","What are the skills required on grass and hard courts? What does the future hold for specialists?

The story so far: Rafael Nadal’s comprehensive defeat of World No.1 Novak Djokovic in the French Open final last Sunday earned him a record-extending 13th Roland Garros crown. The Spaniard now has more than double the number of titles the previous Open Era record-holder, the legendary Bjorn Borg, held (6). The summit clash was Nadal’s 100th match win in Paris, a whopping 26 more than second-placed Djokovic, with only two defeats.

How is Nadal’s game suited for clay?

Nadal, like Borg in his heyday, is an exceptional athlete. He moves swiftly across the turf and uses the heavy top-spin game to clear the net and still pull the ball back safely into the court. The slowness of the surface helps construct points better and the hotter summer temperatures generate more bounce, which, coupled with Nadal’s heavy spin, takes the ball away from the strike-zone of most players. The 34-year-old also receives the serve way behind the baseline, waiting for it to slow down to allow himself the time for a full swing at the ball, before moving closer to the baseline to dictate with his forehand. The courts at Roland Garros are among the biggest in the world, allowing Nadal the space to execute this strategy. His aggressive court-positioning during rallies, depth of shot-making, and the ability to play through nerves and be brave on the most crucial of points have stood out of late. This was particularly evident this year, when even the cold, heavy and low-bouncing conditions could not halt his march. The slowed-down court may have even given him that extra fraction of a second to employ his first-strike approach and helped track down Djokovic’s cross-court backhand.

Editorial | Feat of clay: On French Open tennis championship 2020

According to Michael Chang, the 1989 French Open champion, Nadal being a left-hander is another important part of his success. All the spin he puts on the ball breaks in the opposite direction of what players are accustomed to. Among the top 30 male singles players, Nadal and Denis Shapovalov are the only left-handers, giving them an edge. Growing up in Spain is a big factor too, for clay is the natural surface in the country. It not only teaches the virtue of patience, but also helps develop the ability to choose the right moment to go for the kill.

What are the skills required on grass and hard courts?

Grass generally rewards players whose games flow from their serves — Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Serena Williams, to name a few. Federer’s tennis, through his record eight Wimbledon titles, is instructive. Apart from the serve, no one employs the backhand slice quite like him. On grass, the ball bounces at a low angle and the Federer slice lowers it further and disrupts the rhythm. The ball appears to zip through, forcing the opponent to act faster. Thereby, it exaggerates the speed of the court, which, in turn, plays on the mind and creates indecision in future points. Grass, unlike the crushed brick of Roland Garros, is a living entity and behaves capriciously. No two balls that land on the same spot bounce the same, even when hit at comparable angles and speeds. Federer’s razor-sharp instincts and high skill are often the differentiators.

The hard court, in contrast, is mostly true and rewards a repeatable technique. Unlike grass, it does not wear and tear, and unlike clay, it is not affected by the elements. In terms of speed and bounce, if clay is the slowest and highest, and grass is the fastest and lowest, a hard court is somewhere in between. Djokovic’s style, which does not lend itself to easy categorisation like Federer’s or Nadal’s, has proved the most effective, as his record eight Australian Open and three US Open trophies show. Federer, too, has a combined total of 11 titles in Melbourne and New York, but he won seven of those before Djokovic won his first. The Serb hits a clean, efficient and flat stroke, devoid of top-spin. No one in modern-day tennis takes the ball as early as him and smothers it. This is particularly true of his fine two-hander, which he uses to forcefully change direction or hit flat down the line. Blessed with fleet-footed movement, especially side-to-side, Djokovic is a master at regaining balance and readying himself for the next shot. The acrylic is unforgiving and requires supreme fitness. But Djokovic’s endurance levels are such that he can come up with short bursts of intense, momentum-shifting tennis over long periods of time.

What does the future hold for specialists?

Improvement in racquet technology has, in fact, brought surfaces closer. Compared to yesteryear’s small racquets with clearly demarcated sweet spots, the large-headed modern versions have made hitting through the court easier. The effect of this has been the most pronounced at Wimbledon. With the grass slowing down and the bounce truer and higher, the net-rushing game has become a rarity. In 2001, when Federer beat Sampras and made the last eight, 71% of all his points were serve-and-volley. In the 15 years after that, during which he won seven of his eight crowns at SW19, such points crossed 20% only thrice. Djokovic winning Wimbledon five times and Nadal securing the US Open on four occasions to emerge as the last decade’s most successful champions at the respective Slams are said to be the clearest examples of homogenisation of courts. Lending further credence to this is the fact that Federer and Djokovic, having triumphed just once in Paris, have both reached the final on four other occasions. Nadal’s at the Australian Open is a similar record — winner once and a losing finalist four times.

But across the seven Majors in 2019 and 2020, a pattern has been observed. Nadal has trumped both Federer and Djokovic at the French Open; Djokovic has felled both Nadal and Federer at the Australian Open, and Federer outwitted Nadal at Wimbledon and came within a single stroke of repeating it against Djokovic. Tennis across surfaces may be closer than ever, but it appears that there is still room for the specialist to work his magic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/9vb6jo/article32884047.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Surface,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/the-hindu-explains-what-explains-nadals-dominance-on-clay-federers-mastery-on-grass-and-djokovics-power-on-a-hard-court/article32884048.ece
34,2020/10/18,Artificial Intelligence helps detect deepfake videos,"Researchers tested the tool with an AI-based neural network on videos of former U.S. President Barack Obama. The neural network spotted over 90% of lip syncs involving Obama himself.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Researchers at Stanford University and UC Berkeley have devised a programme that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect deepfake videos.

The programme is said to spot 80% fakes by recognising minute mismatches in the sounds people make and the shape of their mouths, according to the study titled ’Detecting Deep-Fake Videos from Phenome-Viseme Mismatches’.

Deepfake videos can be made using face-swapping or lip sync technologies. Face swap videos can be convincing yet crude, leaving digital or visual artifacts that a computer can detect.

Lip syncing is subtle, and harder to spot. The technology manipulates a smaller part of the image, and then synthesises lip movements that closely match the way a person’s mouth would move if they had said particular words. With enough samples of a person’s image and voice, a deepfake video-maker can manipulate an image to “say” anything, the team said.

The team built a tool to look for ‘visemes’ or mouth formations, and ‘phenomes’ or phonetic sounds.

Watch | Have you been swapping?

It tested the tool with an AI-based neural network on videos of former U.S. President Barack Obama. The neural network spotted over 90% of lip syncs involving Obama himself.

Although the program may help detect visual anomalies, deepfake detection is a cat-and-mouse game. As deepfake techniques improve, fewer clues will be left behind, the team said.

35,2020/10/18,Walk inside cells with this virtual reality software,"The software called vLUME, developed along with a 3D image analysis software firm, Lume, could be used to understand fundamental problems in biology and develop new treatment for diseases.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Scientists at the University of Cambridge have created a virtual reality software which lets researchers walk inside and analyse individual cells.

The software called vLUME, developed along with a 3D image analysis software firm, Lume, could be used to understand fundamental problems in biology and develop new treatment for diseases.

The VR system allows super-resolution microscopy data to be visualised and analysed in virtual reality, and can be used to study everything from individual proteins to entire cells.

Super-resolution microscopy, which was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2014, makes it possible to obtain images at the nanoscale. However, researchers could not come across ways to visualise and analyse the data obtained through this method in three dimension until vLUME.

The software can be loaded with multiple datasets carrying millions of data points, and find patterns using in-built clustering algorithms. These findings can then be shared with collaborators worldwide using image and video features in the software.

“Biology occurs in 3D, but up until now it has been difficult to interact with the data on a 2D computer screen in an intuitive and immersive way,” Dr Steven F Lee, lead researcher, Cambridge’s Department of Chemistry, said in a statement. “It wasn’t until we started seeing our data in virtual reality that everything clicked into place.”

While Alexandre Kitching, CEO of Lume said the software will allow scientists to visualise, question and interact with 3D biological data, in real time within a virtual reality environment.

“Data generated from super-resolution microscopy is extremely complex,” he added. “For scientists, running analysis on this data can be very time-consuming. With vLUME, we have managed to vastly reduce that wait time allowing for more rapid testing and analysis.”

A student from the group of researchers used the software to image an immune cell taken from her own blood, and then stood inside her own cell in virtual reality.

“It’s incredible - it gives you an entirely different perspective on your work,” she said.

Lee said segmenting and viewing the data in vLUME, has enabled him and his team to quickly rule out certain hypotheses and propose new ones.

“All you need is a VR headset,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/3a7ya2/article32885384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/walk-inside-celljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/walk-inside-cells-with-this-virtual-reality-software/article32885378.ece
36,2020/10/18,Lighting lamps to guide physics on its way,"It was a message from my son that broke the news: “Did you see my friend has won the Nobel Prize?” I was tempted to write back, “He is my friend too,” but that was hardly the case. I had met Roger Penrose and interviewed him in Bengaluru, but my son had worked with him. The two of them had watched the semifinal of the cricket World Cup together last year.

The Penroses are an amazing family. Father Lionel was a geneticist, mathematician and chess theorist. Brother Jonathan is a Grandmaster in chess who beat world champion Mikhail Tal in the 1960s, and sister Shirley Hodgson is a geneticist. Amateur psychologists can have a field day with that!

A reviewer in New York Times three decades ago said: “(Roger) Penrose is a gifted mathematician with an impressive record of lighting lamps that have helped guide physics on its way. His research with Stephen Hawking aided in establishing the plausibility of black holes, and brought new insights into the physics of the big bang with which the expansion of the universe is thought to have begun. His work in the early 1970s, on the geometry of what are called aperiodic tiles, impressive just as a matter of pure mathematical invention, turned out to describe the architecture of a new class of crystals the existence of which was not yet known at the time…”

Then there is his connection with the artist Escher and the ‘impossible’ drawings both created.

Penrose is 89. Often theoretical physicists have to wait a while for the Nobel call. Sometimes the committee decides proof is necessary. Peter Higgs won a Nobel in 2013 for work he had done in the 1960s. Penrose published his theory in 1965. Albert Einstein didn’t win for relativity but for the photoelectric effect, although the bending of light predicted by the general theory ( 1915) was confirmed in 1919.

Experimental scientists fare better. When C.V. Raman discovered the Raman Effect, he was so confident of winning the Nobel that he bought two tickets to Stockholm much before the announcements were made!

Penrose’s ‘thought experiments’ need imagination and a willingness to delink the mind from popular theories. His books have both rigour and occasional playfulness. And humility. In The Road to Reality, he writes: “Although in places I shall present opinions that may be regarded as contentious, I have taken pains to make it clear to the reader when I am actually taking such liberties.”

More recently he has asked the question: what if the final state of the universe as we know it is merely the initial big bang of a new cycle?

“Penrose is a philosopher of the first rank, unafraid to grapple with problems that contemporary philosophers tend to dismiss as meaningless,” wrote Martin Gardner.

“In some ways the Nobel is a distraction,” said Penrose. That tells you all you need to know about the man who said he had been making the most of the lockdown to develop new ideas.

38,2020/10/18,Israel and Bahrain to formalise diplomatic ties,"U.S.-Israeli team heads to Manama

Israel and Bahrain will officially establish diplomatic relations on Sunday at a ceremony in Manama as the wealthy Gulf region continues to open up to the Jewish state.

An Israeli delegation, led by National Security Council chief Meir Ben Shabbat, arrived from Tel Aviv for a one-day trip that will see Israel and Bahrain formalise a US-brokered agreement they signed at the White House on September 15.

The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain became only the third and fourth Arab states to agree to normalise ties with Israel, following Israel’s 1979 peace deal with Egypt and a 1994 pact with Jordan.

A flurry of diplomacy between some of Washington’s key regional allies has handed U.S. President Donald Trump a key foreign policy win as he campaigns for re-election ahead of polls in November.

“Bahrain and Israel will sign a joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic, peaceful and friendly relations, as well as a number of memorandums of understanding in areas of mutual benefit,” according to a joint statement.

39,2020/10/18,13 killed in Afghanistan bombing,"Car bomb targeted Afghan police headquarters, nearby govt. buildings in Ghor

A suicide car bombing on Sunday killed at least 13 people and wounded around 120 others in Afghanistan’s western Ghor province, officials said.

The head of a hospital in Ghor, Mohammad Omer Lalzad, said emergency staff were treating dozens of people with both serious and light injuries from the bombing. He expected the death toll to rise.

Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Aran said the car bombing struck near the entrance of the provincial police chief’s office and other nearby government buildings in the area.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in Ghor, which comes amid an uptick in attacks by the Taliban as representatives of the group and Afghan government officials hold their first-ever face-to-face talks in Qatar, where the Taliban have had a political office for many years. The negotiations are meant to end decades of war. in Afghanistan.

Arif Aber, spokesman for the provincial Governor in Ghor, said the blast was so strong that its sound could heard across Feroz Koh, the capital city of the province. “It damaged and partially destroyed a few government buildings, including the police chief’s office, the women’s affairs department and the provincial office for refugees,” Mr. Aber said.

On Friday, the Taliban agreed to suspend attacks in southern Afghanistan, which displaced thousands of residents in recent days. That came after the U.S. vowed to halt all airstrikes in keeping with the peace deal the U.S. signed with the Taliban in February.

40,2020/10/18,Iran hails lifting of UN arms embargo,"Tehran can now buy ‘necessary arms’

Iran said a longstanding UN embargo on arms sales to and from the Islamic republic expired on Sunday in line with a 2015 landmark nuclear deal with world powers from which Washington has withdrawn.

Tehran, which could now purchase weapons from Russia, China and elsewhere, has hailed the development as a diplomatic victory over the U.S., which had tried to maintain an indefinite freeze on arms sales.

Defence needs

“As of today, all restrictions on the transfer of arms, related activities and financial services to and from the Islamic Republic of Iran... are all automatically terminated,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The embargo on the sale of conventional arms to Iran was due to start expiring progressively from Sunday, October 18, under the terms of the UN resolution.

“As of today, the Islamic Republic may procure any necessary arms and equipment from any source without any legal restrictions, and solely based on its defensive needs,” the Ministry added in the statement.

It insisted that under the terms of the deal, struck with the U.S., China, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, “the lifting of arms restrictions and the travel ban were designed to be automatic with no other action required.”

U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the nuclear deal in 2018 and has unilaterally begun reimposing sanctions on Iran. But Washington suffered a setback in August when it failed to win support from the United Nations Security Council to indefinitely extend the arms embargo.

‘Momentous day’

It was “a momentous day for the international community,” the Iranian ministry said on Sunday, adding the world had stood with Tehran “in defiance of the U.S. regime’s efforts”.

But it stressed that “unconventional arms, weapons of mass destruction and a buying spree of conventional arms have no place in Iran’s defense doctrine”.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Sunday marked the “normalisation of Iran’s defense cooperation with the world”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/osizxi/article32887527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-JAVADZARIF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-hails-lifting-of-un-arms-embargo/article32887528.ece
41,2020/10/18,Trump rails against the left to regain lead,"He accuses the Democrats of ‘destroying the American way of life’ in rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin

President Donald Trump leaned into fear tactics on Saturday as he accused the left of trying to “destroy the American way of life” in a late reelection pitch to voters in Michigan and Wisconsin — two Midwestern states that were instrumental to his 2016 victory but may now be slipping from his grasp.

Also read: Trump appeals to GOP base as polls slide

In back-to-back rallies, Mr. Trump accused the left of wanting to “erase American history” and “purge American values.” He claimed, with no basis, that Democratic rival Joe Biden would put communities at risk.

Battleground surveys

Mr. Trump offered the dark message as he faces headwinds not only in national polling, which shows Mr. Biden leading, but also in key battleground surveys. His comments come after his campaign, with far less cash than Mr. Biden’s, largely retreated from TV advertising in the Midwest, shifting much of its money to Sun Belt States such as Florida, North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia, as well as Pennsylvania.

As he tries to energise his base and keep on-the-fence voters from turning against him, Mr. Trump sought to paint Democrats as “anti-American radicals” and said moderates had “a moral duty” to join the Republican Party.

""The Democrat Party you once knew doesn’t exist,” he said.

It was the same on issue after issue, as he claimed in hyperbolic terms that Mr. Biden’s election would spur “the single biggest depression in the history of our country” and “turn Michigan into a refugee camp.”

Addressing the coronavirus crisis, Mr. Trump warned that Biden would “shut down the country, delay the vaccine and prolong the pandemic.” Public health experts say the nation would be in far better shape had Trump’s administration taken more aggressive action early on.

And while he repeatedly predicted victory, Mr. Trump seemed to grapple throughout the day with the prospect that he could indeed lose in November.

In Michigan, he quipped that, in January, he “better damn well be President. In Wisconsin, he wondered how he would process a loss.

“Can you imagine if I lose? I will have lost to the worst candidate in the history of American politics,” he said. “What do I do?”

Mr. Trump has continued to hold rallies despite the threat of the coronavirus, which hospitalised him for several days earlier this month.

Wisconsin broke the record for new positive virus cases on Friday - the third time that’s happened in a week. The state also hit record highs for daily deaths and hospitalizations this past week. But there was little evidence of concern among the thousands of supporters Trump drew in both states, where audience members stood closely together in the cold, mostly without masks.

Mr. Trump continued to call on Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to roll back restrictions that remain in place to try to halt the spread of the virus, prompting the crowd to break into a “Lock her up!” chant. (The same chant also broke out after he mentioned his 2016 Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar.)",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nx0jqx/article32887445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-APTOPIXWOMENSMARCHWASHINGTON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-rails-against-the-left-to-regain-lead/article32887447.ece
42,2020/10/18,Bolivians hope presidential election will restore political stability,"Polls show Mr. Arce ahead, but not enough to avoid a runoff that would take place in late November.

Bolivians began voting on Sunday in a presidential election many hope can restore stability to a nation that was plunged into turmoil after a fraught and eventually voided vote last year, leaving the country in the hands of an interim president.

Frontrunners in the election are Luis Arce, who champions a return to the socialist and pro-indigenous policies of former President Evo Morales, and Carlos Mesa, a centrist who served as president in the early 2000s.

Polls show Mr. Arce ahead, but not enough to avoid a runoff that would take place in late November.

“The vote is set to be the most important since Bolivia returned to democracy in 1982,” said Carlos Valverde, a political analyst.

A last-minute decision by Bolivia's electoral authority not to release preliminary results on Sunday night has added a layer of tension to the election. Morales said the decision was ”highly worrying,” while Mr. Mesa's party said it was disappointing but understandable.

It was not clear when the first official results will now be available, although private firms are still expected to conduct exit polling.

The in-person vote amid the coronavirus pandemic will also be a test of the left's clout in Latin America. Mr. Morales was a key figure in a wave of leftist presidents in the region over the last decade.

Bolivia erupted in violence late last year when Mr. Morales sought a fourth term in a disputed election that has since been annulled. The violence cost at least 30 lives, sparked food shortages and forced Mr. Morales to resign after almost 14 years in power.

On Saturday, La Paz, a city starkly divided by class and race, appeared calm but residents acknowledged they are worried that the result could spark more violence, especially if Mr. Arce's vote count falls short.

Mr. Arce told local media this week that the only way his rival could win is “through fraud.”

Freddy Mamami, a member of Arce's Movement Toward Socialism party who is running for Congress, told Reuters: “If the electoral verdict is in line with the objective reality we see, nothing will happen.”

The socialist stronghold of El Alto, a center of last year's violence, is seen as particularly volatile. The city was built by indigenous Bolivians atop a mountain overlooking La Paz and has grown to dwarf the capital city in population.

The election was originally scheduled to take place in May, but was postponed several times due to concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jrvm5h/article32886363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOLIVIA-ELECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bolivians-hope-presidential-election-will-restore-political-stability/article32886364.ece
43,2020/10/18,"Pakistan removes names of over 5,000 individuals from travel blacklist","The committee will consider rest of the cases in its forthcoming periodic review.

Pakistan authorities have removed the names of over 5,000 individuals from the travel blacklist after the government took note of the problems faced by citizens whose names have been blacklisted for a long time, according to a media report on Sunday.

Interior Minister Ijaz Shah, in a meeting held recently, directed the review committee of the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports to meet biannually to review cases of blacklisted individuals.

The meeting was held after a gap of almost four years. The previous meeting was held in December 2016.

Taking note of problems faced by the blacklisted citizens, the minister directed the Immigration and Passports director general to immediately convene a meeting of the periodical review committee to consider cases on merit and remove names from the blacklist after the due process, according to a report in the Dawn newspaper.

The committee reviewed the names of citizens falling in category B of the blacklist and removed the names of 5,807 individuals out of a list of 42,725 people.

The committee will consider rest of the cases in its forthcoming periodic review, the report said.

There are two main blacklist categories – Category ‘A’ includes names of those involved in serious crimes like terrorism, money laundering and anti-state activities, whereas the ‘B’ category mainly has names of deportees who had either travelled abroad on forged documents or were found involved in crime in the host country, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/galb4g/article32886258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAKISTAN-AIRLINESPILOTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-removes-names-of-over-5000-individuals-from-travel-blacklist/article32886259.ece
44,2020/10/18,"China beefs up laws to handle epidemics, protect whistleblowers","The new law also calls for systems including to regularly monitor biosafety risks, and to trace the origins of incidents.

China has passed a new law to improve its handling of disease outbreaks — including protecting whistleblowers — following a cascade of criticism over its coronavirus response and accusations of an early cover-up.

The new biosecurity law, approved by lawmakers on Saturday, flags the right to report “acts that endanger biosecurity” and calls for risk prevention systems, ranging from active monitoring to emergency plans.

It takes effect from April 15 next year.

“Any work unit or individual has the right to report acts that endanger biosecurity,” the regulation said.

Also read: Coronavirus | China administering COVID-19 vaccines since July, says official

“When a report is required according to the law, no work unit or individual shall conceal (it)... or hinder others from making a report,” it added on infectious diseases and epidemics.

China's approval of the law comes in the face of Western criticism on the coronavirus, over accusations that it covered up the initial outbreak and silenced early whistleblowers.

Also read: Coronavirus | China sees over 100 cases for first time in over three months amidst fear of second wave

But China has been trying to reshape this narrative, with authorities seeking instead to model the country as a vanguard in the pandemic fight.

Although doctor Li Wenliang who alerted colleagues to the new coronavirus in late December was at first reprimanded, a national outpouring of grief and anger over his death prompted Beijing to redirect criticism to local officials and subsequently paint him as a hero.

President Xi Jinping in February raised the need to speed up establishing the biosecurity law, urging for reforms of mechanisms to prevent major outbreaks.

Under the new law, those who conceal information, omit making reports or prevent others from reporting infectious diseases could be given warnings or suspended.

The new law also calls for systems including to regularly monitor biosafety risks, and to trace the origins of incidents.

Disease prevention agencies are also to help predict the occurrence and prevalence of emerging diseases.

Based on these predictions, authorities should announce warnings and adopt prevention measures.

Although Beijing established an information system after the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak that allowed for real-time reports of outbreaks, provincial authorities came under fire during the coronavirus outbreak for perceived incompetence, including delays in announcing the public health emergency.

45,2020/10/18,"Pakistan fails to fulfil 6 key mandates of FATF; no action against Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed","Pakistan’s failure to fulfil six key obligations of the FATF, including action against two of India’s most wanted terrorists Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed, and the sudden disappearance of more than 4,000 terrorists from its official list will most likely lead to its continuation in the ‘grey list’ of the Global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, officials said on Sunday.

The virtual plenary of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to be held on October 21-23, will take the final call on Pakistan’s continuation on its grey list after a thorough review of Islamabad’s performance in fulfilling the global commitments and standards in the fight against money laundering and terror financing.

The FATF had given Pakistan a total of 27 action plan obligations for completely checking terror financing of which so far it has cleared 21 but has failed in some of the key tasks, an official privy to the developments said.

The mandates which Pakistan has failed include action against all UN-designated terrorists like Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Azhar, Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Seed and the outfit’s operational commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi.

Besides, FATF has strongly noted the fact that there was sudden disappearance of the names of more than 4,000 terrorists from its original list of 7,600 under Schedule IV of its Anti Terrorism Act.

Under these circumstances, it is almost certain that Pakistan will continue in the FATF grey list, the official said.

Also, the four nominating countries — the United States, Britain, France and Germany — are also not satisfied with Islamabad’s commitment to taking strong action against the terror groups operating from its soil.

Azhar, Saeed and Lakhvi are most wanted terrorists in India for their involvement in numerous terrorist acts, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror strikes and the bombing of a CRPF bus at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir last year.

With Pakistan’s continuation in the grey list, it is increasingly becoming difficult for Islamabad to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the neighbouring country which is in a precarious financial situation.

The FATF will also judge if competent authorities in Pakistan were cooperating and taking action to identify and taking enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services and had proven implementation of cross-border currency and bearer negotiable instruments controls at all ports of entry, including applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.

The country’s outstanding action areas also include effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all 1,267 and 1,373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets (movable and immovable), and prohibiting access to funds and financial services, another official said.

The FATF plenary was earlier scheduled in June, but Pakistan got an unexpected breather after the global watchdog against financial crimes temporarily postponed all mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines in the wake of grave health risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The watchdog also put a general pause in the review process, thus giving additional four months to Pakistan to meet the requirements.

Pakistan needed 12 votes out of 39 to exit the grey list and move to the white list. To avoid the blacklist, it needs the support of three countries. China, Turkey and Malaysia are its consistent supporters.

Currently, North Korea and Iran are on the FATF blacklist.

Pakistan was placed on the grey list by the FATF in June 2018 and was given a plan of action to complete it by October 2019. Since then, the country continues to be on that list due to its failure to comply with the FATF mandates.

The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terror financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.

The FATF currently has 39 members, including two regional organisations — the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council.

46,2020/10/18,China passes new law restricting sensitive exports,"Under the law, China can take reciprocal measures toward countries or regions that abuse export controls and threaten its national security and interests.

China has passed a new law restricting sensitive exports to protect national security, allowing Beijing to reciprocate against the U.S. as tensions mount between the sides over trade and technology.

The law, which will apply to all companies in China, was passed on Saturday by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee and will take effect on December 1.

Under the law, China can take reciprocal measures toward countries or regions that abuse export controls and threaten its national security and interests.

Export controls under the law will apply to civilian, military and nuclear products, as well as goods, technologies and services related to national security. A list of controlled items will be published in a timely manner in conjunction with relevant departments, according to the law.

The new law allows Beijing to retaliate against the U.S., which in recent months has attempted to block Chinese technology firms such as telecommunications gear supplier Huawei, Bytedance’s TikTok app and Tencent’s messaging app WeChat on grounds of posing a national security threat, including the data they may possess from operating in the country.

Companies and individuals who endanger national security by breaching the new export control law, including those outside of China, could face criminal charges. Violations of the law, such as exporting items without a permit, could result in fines of 5 million yuan ($746,500), or up to 20 times the business value of the illegal transaction.

The new law adds to the growing uncertainty of Bytedance’s deal to sell its video app TikTok to U.S. firm Oracle Corp. In August, China added technologies including voice recognition, text analysis and content recommendation to its list of regulated exports.

President Donald Trump had earlier ordered Bytedance to sell its U.S. operations of TikTok to an American firm or face a block in the country.

47,2020/10/18,"U.S., Israeli envoys fly to Bahrain to advance nascent ties","Bahrain and the UAE formally signed the agreement to normalise relations with Israel in a ceremony at the White House on Septemer 15.

A joint American-Israeli delegation was set to fly to Bahrain on Sunday on the first direct Israeli commercial flight to the Gulf Arab state, where they’ll be signing a number of bilateral agreements following an announcement last month to normalise relations.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser, Meir Ben-Shabbat, are leading the delegation that is flying out of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport.

El Al flight 973 - a nod to the international dialing code for Bahrain - will fly through Saudi Arabia’s airspace en route to Manama, where dignitaries from all three countries will speak at a ceremony after landing.

""It will be the official establishment of the diplomatic relations between the two countries,” an Israeli diplomatic official said, speaking on condition of anonymity pending the official announcement.

The decision to establish ties with Israel has outraged the Palestinians, whose leadership has blasted the Bahraini move, and a similar Emirati deal, as a betrayal and an undermining of the Arab stance that recognition of Israel should come only after Palestinians achieve an independent state of their own.

As part of the deal to normalise relations, the two Gulf Arab states and Israel will eventually establish embassies and exchange ambassadors. The Israeli official said the Israeli embassy was expected to open in Bahrain in the coming months.

Similar to the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain is expected to open its embassy at some point in the city of Tel Aviv, where most foreign embassies are located because of Jerusalem’s contested status.

Bahraini and Israeli officials have held numerous conversations since announcing their intention to establish full ties. Sunday’s face-to-face meetings, however, are seen as another step toward normalisation.

Meanwhile, Israel and the UAE have already signed a number of business, banking and intergovernmental agreements.

Bahrain and the UAE formally signed the agreement to normalise relations with Israel in a ceremony at the White House on Septemer 15. Egypt and Jordan are the only other two Arab states to sign diplomatic treaties with Israel, in 1979 and 1994, respectively.

The accords made public what had been a gradual strengthening of quiet ties between Israel and several Gulf states - forged in recent years over a shared concern over regional rival Iran. Other Arab countries could follow suit, with analysts and insiders pointing to Sudan, Oman and Morocco as possibilities.

The Israeli delegation is slated to fly back to Tel Aviv later on Sunday, while the Americans will head to the UAE before flying to Israel on Tuesday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ok1doi/article32603021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14IN-ISRAEL-GULFUSA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-israeli-envoys-fly-to-bahrain-to-advance-nascent-ties/article32885485.ece

China’s health authority has confirmed the detection and isolation of living novel coronavirus on the outer packaging of imported frozen marine fish the port city of Qingdao.

It is for the first time in the world that living novel coronavirus has been isolated from the outer packaging of cold-chain food, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement on Saturday.

Also read | Chinese cities find coronavirus in frozen food imports, WHO downplays infection risk

The authorities in Qingdao, where a new cluster of COVID-19 cases were reported recently, conducted tests on all of its about 11 million population. No new clusters of cases were found after the tests, the local authorities said.

In July, China suspended imports of frozen shrimp after the deadly virus was found on packages and the inner wall of a container.

The CDC said it detected and isolated the living virus on the outer packaging of imported frozen cod in Qingdao.

The finding was made during an investigation to trace the source of recent infections reported in the city. It has proved that contact with packaging contaminated by living novel coronavirus could lead to infection, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, quoting the CDC statement.

The statement, however, did not mention the country from where the package was imported.

The agency said the risk of cold-chain food circulating in China’s market being contaminated by the novel coronavirus is very low, citing recent nucleic acid test results for samples taken from the business.

A total of 2.98 million samples had been tested across the country’s 24 provincial-level regions by September 15, including 670,000 taken from cold-chain food or food packaging, 1.24 million from working staff and 1.07 million from the environment.

Only 22 samples from cold-chain food or food packaging tested positive for the virus, the CDC said.

Meanwhile, the National Health Commission on Sunday said 13 confirmed COVID-19 cases, all arriving from outside the mainland, were reported on Saturday. There was no new locally transmitted COVID-19 case, it said.

Of the imported cases, five were reported in Shanghai, four in Guangdong, two in Shaanxi and one each in Tianjin and Sichuan.

As of Saturday, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on the mainland reached 85,672.

Altogether 80,786 patients have been discharged after recovery, while the death toll stood at 4,634, the Commission said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/sn75t7/article32055801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/living-coronavirus-found-on-imported-frozen-food-packaging-in-china/article32885391.ece
49,2020/10/18,"Outrage over mispronunciation of Kamala Harris’ name, supporters launch online campaign","Spokesperson of David Perdue said the Senator had mispronounced the name and he did not mean anything by it

Outraged over the mispronunciation of Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ name by a Republican Senator from Georgia, her supporters launched an online campaign with the hashtags ‘MyNameIs’ and ‘IstandwithKamala’

During an election rally of U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday in Macon City in Georgia, a battleground state, Senator David Perdue mispronounced Ms. Harris’ name.

“KAH’-mah-lah? Kah-MAH’-lah? Kamala-mala-mala? I don’t know. Whatever,” he told thousands of his supporters.

The mispronunciation outraged a large number of Ms. Harris’ supporters and her spokesperson Sabrina Singh said, “I’ll keep it simple: If you can pronounce ‘former’ Senator David Perdue, you can pronounce ‘future’ Vice President Kamala Harris”.

Watch | Who is Kamala Harris?

Condemning Mr. Perdue, Amit Jani — the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Outreach Coordinator of the Biden campaign — launched the ‘My name is’ campaign to “push back against the bigotry”.

BuzzFeed on Saturday reported that Mr. Perdue, who is seeking his reelection from Georgia, is facing backlash for mockingly mispronouncing Ms. Harris’ name.

Spokesperson of Mr. Perdue said the Senator mispronounced the name and he did not mean anything by it.

Several people gave the origin and meaning of their names as they expressed outrage at the mispronunciation of the democratic vice-presidential candidate’s name.

Preet Bharara, former attorney general for the powerful southern district of New York tweeted, “#MyName is Preet, which means love”.

“#MyNameIs Meenakshi. I’m named after the Hindu goddess, as well as my great great grandmother. I come from a long line of strong women who taught me to be proud of my heritage and to demand respect - especially from racist white men like @sendavidperdue who are threatened by us,” tweeted Meena Harris, a lawyer and author.

Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar from Minnesota tweeted, “#MyNameIs Ilham, I prefer Ilhan. I never liked the M sound Winking face with tongue. It means Inspiration in Arabic. My father named me Ilham and inspired me to lead a life of service to others. In his honour I am voting for an inspirational ticket over desperate and maddening one”.

According to Erin Wilson, National Political Director at Biden for President, his name has Irish origin. “All of our names deserve respect,” she said.

Indian-American Democratic fund raiser Shekar Narasimhan said his name means a Hindu God who represents a half man-half lion and exhibits courage and humanity.

“My son’s name was Sidarth to symbolise Gautama Buddha, the enlightened One. We are proud Americans and can pronounce others names correctly,” he tweeted.

Expressing support for presidential nominee Joe Biden and Ms. Harris, Indian- American Congressman Ro Khanna tweeted, “#MyNameIs Rohit, and my friends call me Ro. It means bright light in Sanskrit”.

Mr. Khanna said in the upcoming election, he will vote for an “inclusive” America by voting for Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.

“My great grandmother’s name was Kamala. Not ‘Kamala-mala-mala, I don’t know, whatever’ #MyNameIs Gautam. It means bright light. The kind of bright light a Biden-Harris administration will represent,” tweeted Gautam Raghavan, who is heading the transition team of the Biden campaign.

“#MyNameIs Zhao-Mei-Shin. It means ‘beautiful heart’ in Mandarin. My grandparents risked it all & came here to offer their kids a better life. Now, their grandchild is the 1st Chinese American Congresswoman. #IWillVote bc Joe & Kamala know our diversity is our strength,” tweeted Congresswoman Judy Chu.

Mr. Perdue’s spokesperson John Burke in a tweet said that he was making an argument against the radical socialist agenda.

“Senator Perdue simply mispronounced Senator Harris’ name, and he didn’t mean anything by it. He was making an argument against the radical socialist agenda that she and her endorsed candidate Jon Ossoff are pushing, which includes the Green New Deal,” Mr. Burke tweeted.

“#MyNameIs Hiral. It means diamond, bright, full of luster. Sparkles My mom used to say that they picked it because she saw a bright light reflecting from me & a toughness that made me unbreakable. Glowing star It’s that strength my mom saw in me that gave me the courage to run for Congress,” tweeted Indian American Congressional candidate from Arizona, Dr Hiral Tipirneni.

Democratic fund raiser from California Ajay Jain Bhutoria said Ms. Harris was attacked by Senator Perdue for her Indian name.

“Please help us push back against this bigotry, will you join thousands of celebrities, elected officials and friends in all communities by tweeting or sharing #MyNameIs...,” he said in an appeal.

“#mynameis Ajay. Ajay is an Indian given name originating in Sanskrit ‘ajaya’, which means ‘unconquered’, ‘unsurpassed’, ‘invincible’ I’ll keep it simple: If you can pronounce former Senator David Perdue you can pronounce future Vice President Kamala Harris. All of our names deserve respect. I stand with @KamalaHarris,” Mr. Bhutoria said.

Indian-American lawmaker Pramila Jaipal said her name comes from the Sanskrit word prem , which means love.

“The name is constantly mispronounced as is my last name. I only mind that when it is done willfully and continuously. Let’s build an inclusive America. Vote #BidenHarris2020. Our vote, our power,” she tweeted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ru6uzh/article32544470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KAMALAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/outrage-over-mispronunciation-of-kamala-harris-name-supporters-launch-online-campaign/article32885340.ece
50,2020/10/18,Thousands of protesters hit the streets across Thailand,"They defy govt. ban on gatherings for third consecutive day

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in a wave of protests across Bangkok and other Thai cities on Saturday in defiance of a government crackdown following three months of demonstrations aimed at the Prime Minister and monarchy.

Many protesters said they had been stirred into action by the police’s use of water cannon on Friday to disperse thousands of youth-led protesters who included many children.

“It was way over the line. We want to show them our power and that we cant accept this,” said Tang, a 27-year-old office worker among thousands of people who gathered at the Lat Phrao station in the capital city Bangkok.

Police attempts to thwart protesters by shutting down Bangkok’s public transport network backfired when it led to localised protests across the city involving three main centres and several other smaller demonstrations. There were demonstrations in at least six cities outside Bangkok too.

Police did not intervene, and the protests dispersed after several hours. “We will primarily negotiate,” police spokesman Yingyos Thepjamnong told a news conference. “Enforcing the law will be step by step, using methods that follow international standards.”

PM’s removal sought

Protesters demand the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former military ruler. They have also become openly critical of King Maha Vajiralongkorn despite lese majeste laws that can mean 15 years in jail for insulting the monarchy.

On Thursday, the government banned all political gatherings of five or more people.

French police have arrested nine people after a suspected Islamist sympathiser beheaded a school teacher on the street of a Paris suburb on Friday, police sources said.

Investigators were trying to establish whether the attacker, who was shot dead by police, had acted alone or had accomplices. French media reported that he was an 18-year-old of Chechen origin.

Witnesses heard the assailant shout “Allahu Akbar” or “God is Greatest”, a police source said. His victim, a history teacher, had earlier this month shown his pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics class on freedom of expression.

The had had approached pupils in the street and asked them to point out his victim, anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said on Saturday.

President Emmanuel Macron called the incident Islamist terrorism.

Four relatives of the attacker, including a minor, were detained in the immediate hours after the attack. Five more were detained overnight, among them two parents of pupils at the College du Bois d'Aulne, where the teacher was employed.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi held joint election campaign on Sunday and launched a blistering attack on rival Lalu Prasad highlighting the crime situation and lack of development during his RJD rule in the past.

Reeling out comparative data during 15 years under the RJD and an equal period under the NDA now, the two leaders sought another chance from voters to speed up developent work in the State in the next five years.

The two started the day with a public meeting at Buxar, where BJP has fielded Parshuram Chaturvedi as its candidate.

He is pitted against sitting MLA Sanjay Kumar Tiwari of the Congress.

This was the constituency from where former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, who took VRS and joined JD(U), was expected to enter the poll fray, but the seat went to ally BJP under the seat-sharing deal.

After launching separate campaign since beginning of this week, Kumar and Sushil Modi moved together on Sunday and sought support for BJP as well as JD(U) nominees on four seats of Buxar, Dumraon, Tarari and Jagdishpur.

In the Buxar rally, former State Police Chief and JD(U) leader Gupteshwar Pandey was not present.

But, the BJP nominee Parshuram Chaturvedi, said he enjoys his support and blessings.

Mr. Chaturvedi himself had taken premature retirement as Assistant Sub Inspector in the Bihar police in 2003 and joined politics.

“Gupteshwar Pandey is not only my boss in police but also an elder brother to whom I touch feet out of respect and he has always shower blessings on me,” Mr. Chaturvedi told PTI.

Both the CM and Sushil Modi kept their focus on the RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and highlighted the condition prevailing in the State during 1990 to 2005 which both described as “jungle raj”.

“What was the condition of law and order at that time. People were afraid to step out of home after sunset. We ended ’jungle raj’ and established ‘rule of law’,” Mr. Kumar said at the Buxar rally.

Both referred to corruption prevailing during the RJD regime and Prasad himself indulging in corrupt practices.

“Those involved in self servie are behind the bars today and many more will follow them soon,” Mr. Kumar said.

Mr. Prasad is in Ranchi jail after being convicted in four cases of multi-crore rupees fodder scam.

While Mr. Kumar highlighted “inexperience” of the opposition Chief Ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav, though he did not name him, and accused him of making “anap-sanap” (illogical) statements against him to get “publicity”, Sushil Modi was more severe in criticising him.

“See a man who failed in class 9th and has no history of any family business is today owener of 52 properties at an age of 31. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has long innings as Chief Minister of Gujarat and PM for last six years, is no match to him financially,” Sushil Modi said in an apparent jibe at Tejashwi Yadav.

Sushil Modi praised the Nitish Kumar’s ministry for effectively dealing with the COVID pandemic in Bihar and hit out at the Maharashtra government in which Congress is one of the partners for doing precious little in this regard.

“More than 40,000 people lost their lives due to coronavirus in Maharashtra where Congress is part of the ruling dispensation. Whereas in Bihar, the NDA government by making proper arrangements has minimised the death toll to less than 1000 so far,” Sushil Modi, who is a senior BJP leader of the State, said.

Also read: Bihar Assembly elections | We will see a BJP-LJP government, says Chirag Paswan

You must be getting a feeling of deja vu, since through the Maharashtra polls and after, you have dealt with alliance issues with Janata Dal (U) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP).

It’s not exactly deja vu as there is a huge difference between our alliance here and the one we had in Maharashtra. In Maharashtra there was always a hostility; for five years they (Shiv Sena) were with us but since the municipal corporation elections, they had already declared they would not want to continue the alliance. But we came together in the Lok Sabha polls. Even when with us they (Sena) behaved like an opposition party within the government.

That is not the case in Bihar. We may have separated in 2013, but when we came back together in 2017, there was absolutely coherent synergy. I have been involved in seat negotiations in the last few weeks, and the way the conversations took place here were very different from that with Shiv Sena, in tone and tenor. The co-ordination here was much better far more convivial.

There have been many strongly worded statements from the BJP on Nitish Kumar being the leader of the NDA in Bihar in the last few days. Have you been able to convince your voters and also your ally?

As of now, they (JD-U) are convinced that this alliance is coherent. I don’t see any doubt in their minds. We are holding joint sabhas and meetings with leaders from both our parties on the dais. Ultimately, the narrative is set on the ground level, and when people see that the foot soldiers of JD(U) and the BJP are working together, it sets the mind at rest.

We have lots of respect for Ram Vilasji (late leader Ram Vilas Paswan) and I wish young Chirag well. I cannot wish that he is a victor in these elections as ultimately he is not fighting as part of our coalition. I think that his position, which he took, was incorrect. When you say you are part of NDA at the Centre, you cannot say that you will disregard (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji. In the same way in Bihar, if you are part of NDA you cannot disregard Nitish Kumar. Undoubted the leader of NDA in Bihar is Nitishji.

If all of you have this opinion, then it raises a question mark on Mr. Paswan’s continuance in the NDA even at the Centre.

We haven’t thought of it yet. In politics you cannot predict what may happen in the future.

A very painful thread of events has been the situation with regard to inter-State workers during the lockdown. There was a lot of hurt feeling among these workers at what they felt was abandonment by their home State. How do you view the issue?

Initially, there were problems of transportation, but once that was sorted out, the government here, with its experience of running relief camps due to seasonal flooding, very soon created camps for these inter-State workers, and arranged money in their accounts and daily expenses. Once it started, people seemed ok with it, I don’t see any anti-incumbency due to that.

What will be the main thrust of your campaign?

It can be summed up in one word, bharosa (faith). People have faith in Modi ji; we are going forward on that. Also Nitish ji has been at the helm of affairs for 15 years and his image is clean which is not a very common occurrence and it matters to the voter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/57qsak/article32886182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEVENDRAFADNAVIS,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/i-cannot-wish-that-chirag-paswan-is-a-victor-in-the-bihar-elections-says-devendra-fadnavis/article32886183.ece
56,2020/10/18,Bihar Assembly elections | EC’s distancing norms go for a toss during campaign,"The rules are visibly being violated in indoor public meetings where the crowd is not to exceed 200 and in rallies where social distancing of at least six feet is expected.

India’s first full fledged Assembly elections held amid the COVID-19 pandemic is under way in Bihar, and the Election Commission of India (ECI) guidelines for campaigning are clearly only being observed in breach.

In indoor public meetings where the crowd is not to exceed 200 and social distancing of at least six feet is expected in rallies, the rules are visibly being violated. In Chapra, at a Janata Dal (United) meeting held by candidate Chandrika Rai (ex-father-in-law of Tej Pratap Yadav), the rally stage itself collapsed as there were too many people atop it. In Gaya, the local administration has lodged an FIR against organisers of an event where Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president J.P. Nadda was present for violating social distancing norms. When Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leaders Tejaswi and Tej Pratap Yadav filed their nomination papers, they too took out a mini-road show violating norms. Politically, social distancing violation has become an equal opportunity infraction.

Opinion: Conducting elections during a pandemic

Some of it, say party leaders, is due to the fact that for long elections have been a participative event not just on polling day but during campaigns too. Big shows of strength with a large turnout are par for the course while filing nominations, and public rallies. The EC’s rules allowing only a handful of people in these events is a culture shock yet to be adapted to.

“The Election Commission has set proper guidelines, although yes, they are being observed more in breach as we as a society experience elections as a festival with high participation. Fortunately for Bihar, COVID-19 incidence is low with highest recovery rate and second highest level of testing in the country. Perhaps it has given people some sort of signal to move ahead with activities, but that cannot be allowed, we need to improve,” said BJP prabhari for Bihar polls Devendra Fadnavis when he spoke to The Hindu during a sit down interview.

A senior Union Minister from Bihar remarked that there is widespread belief in the countryside that COVID-19 pandemic was over or at any rate was not an issue in rural areas. “I was told that wearing a mask was akin to putting a ‘jaaby’ (nose bag with hay) around the neck of cattle,” he said. Indeed, mask wearing is rarer in the countryside, and photos of rallies in rural areas show this quite clearly.

Apart from this, the rules have also given rise to more basic issues of power and authority. Dhiraj Kushwaha, spokesperson for the Upendra Kukshwaha-led Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), told The Hindu that his party was finding it difficult reserving grounds designated for public meetings in various districts as they had been booked by the ruling NDA. “We are quite worried as this makes it difficult for us to hold slightly big meetings within EC rules. The ruling combine has managed to book all the space,” he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to address his first rallies in the polls on October 23, to be a mix of real and virtual and BJP sources said that all will be done within the EC’s rules. The Bihar polls will be a template for the next set of polls to be held, possibly early next year, with many lessons learnt.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/tbuzqx/article32888162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19BIHARP1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/ecs-covid-19-guidelines-observed-in-breach-during-bihar-poll-campaign/article32885805.ece

CM but not Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi, says Rameshwar Prasad Chaurasia","The former BJP leader, who is contesting the Assembly poll on LJP ticket, told The Hindu in an interview that the BJP-LJP combine will form the government and that the RJD will stand at No. 2 position, in terms of number of seats won.

Daily at 6 a.m. Rameshwar Prasad Chaurasia, former BJP leader contesting the election on Lok Janshakti Party ticket from Sasaram Assembly constituency in Bihar, begins his campaign while taking a morning stroll in the town area.

The bachelor leader moves alone and takes his tea at road-side stalls with local shopkeepers, cart pullers and newspaper hawkers, all of whom readily recognise him. Around 8 a.m., he wraps up his programme and a few people come with him to a dingy hotel opposite Sasaram railway junction before he sets off on the day’s schedule. During day, he visits villages in an SUV and at night he holds meetings with his supporters to get the feedback on the poll situation.

“This has been my routine for quite some…I get my morning tea and lunch offered by local people...am not a new face to them,” Mr. Chaurasia, who has been in the BJP for the last 30 years and a four-time party MLA from neighbouring Nokha Assembly constituency, told The Hindu in his second floor hotel room late on Friday.

Despite being assured by the top party leadership, he was denied ticket this time and got an offer from the LJP in “two minutes”, he said. When the news reached the BJP leadership that he had joined the LJP and was going to contest on that party ticket, the same BJP leaders started calling him up and later, after having a discussion with them, he returned the LJP ticket.

“But, when this news was flashed in media, my friends, well-wishers and supporters put immense pressure on me to contest the election…I succumbed to their requests and pressure and jumped into the poll arena, finally on LJP ticket,” he said while watching the news on a small TV set in his hotel room. “I’m thankful to LJP president Chirag Paswan for having patience with my reconsideration in quick succession,” he added.

Mr. Chaurasia’s close proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also known to all in the State BJP. At a time when most of the State BJP party leaders led by Sushil Kumar Modi were calling Nitish Kumar “PM material” before 2014, Mr. Chaurasia was in Gujarat rooting for Mr. Narendra Modi for the coveted position. Later, he was even made in-charge of the Delhi State unit and also appointed co-incharge of the party in Uttar Pradesh.

Over a cup of tea, Mr. Chaurasia spoke to The Hindu at length on several issues related to the current Assembly election and the popular perception that “it’s more a contest between the BJP and the JD(U) rather than the NDA and the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ (Grand Alliance) in Bihar poll”. He said he was even offered party ticket by the RJD which he politely declined.

Excerpts from the interview:

Are you a shadow candidate of the BJP contesting in Sasaram Assembly constituency on LJP ticket?

Absolutely not. I’m contesting on the Lok Janshakti Party ticket and contesting the poll to defeat the sitting JD(U) candidate Ashok Kumar. (Ashok Kumar won the last 2015 Assembly poll on RJD ticket).

But, the BJP recently expelled you along with others contesting the poll on LJP ticket?

Yes. But we’re expelled by the State BJP president who himself was earlier expelled from the party and had joined the RJD to come back to the BJP again. Our expulsion was totally against the party constitution.

Also read: Bihar Assembly elections | BJP, JD(U), LJP to fight polls together, says Nadda

Any chance of returning to the BJP after the election (irrespective of winning or losing it)?

For the last 30 years, I’ve been a BJP worker. I won Assembly elections four times on party ticket…the BJP is like my mother and how can one betray his mother in his life time. But, I cannot cheat LJP chief Chirag Paswan as well on whose party symbol I’m contesting the poll. Moreover, where is the difference between the BJP and the LJP? You yourself can see all local BJP workers here are campaigning for me despite repeated warnings by some State BJP leaders.

Who will come to power after this election?

BJP-LJP will form the government. The RJD will come at number 2 position, in terms of winning seats. Do you see any JD(U) workers here or anywhere else?

And, who will be the Chief Minister and Deputy CM of the State?

Anyone, but not Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi.

Is it plan-B for the BJP to have a party CM and one Dy. CM each from the LJP and the RJD? Do you see any substance in this?

58,2020/10/18,Bessemer lays the foundation for steel,"An English inventor and engineer, Henry Bessemer has over 100 patents to his credit. He is, however, best known for a process that bears his name. This process was the first to mass-produce steel inexpensively, changing the urban future forever. A.S.Ganesh looks at the life of Bessemer and the successes he enjoyed...

One of the most important materials in today’s world is steel. It has become an integral building block in humanity’s ever-expanding domain on Earth and lets us build everything from towering skyscrapers to huge bridges. The man who gave us this steel that lies at the foundation of modern-day infrastructure is English inventor and engineer Henry Bessemer.

Born in Charlton, England in 1813, Bessemer was the son of an engineer, printer and typesetter. Even though he was largely self-educated, Bessemer showed an aptitude for inventing from an early age and had a natural flair for mechanical skills.

While still a teenager, Bessemer came up with the idea of movable stamps for dating title deeds and other government documents. He improvised the idea and it saved a lot of money for those in the business, but Bessemer hardly gained monetarily for his methods.

Becomes secretive

After having learnt it the hard way, Bessemer decided that he probably had to be more secretive with his ideas. So when he came up with a method that allowed him to manufacture a powder using brass as a paint additive, he kept it to himself. He invented machines to mimic his mixing, set up a factory where the process remained top-secret and produced this powder, which could be used as a gold substitute for décor. As the floral decorations of the time required large quantities of such material, Bessemer was able to gain great wealth in the process.

During the Crimean War (1853-56), Bessemer came up with an artillery shell that was heavier than the typically used canon balls. While the French authorities were interested, they pointed out to him that their cast-iron cannon wouldn’t be strong enough for these shells. That put him on the path to produce stronger cast iron, leading him to a cheap way of mass-producing steel.

Air and heat

While experimenting, Bessemer observed that oxygen in the furnace removed excess carbon and impurities from pig iron being preheated, leaving pure iron. He then realised that blowing air through melted iron purified the iron and heated it more, allowing it to be poured more easily.

These techniques, which came to be known as the Bessemer process, were patented by him in October 1855. He also came up with the Bessemer converter, a huge egg-shaped contraption into which molten pig iron could be poured and then air could be blown from below after it is tilted. Using this, Bessemer was able to cheaply produce large quantities of steel.

Urban infrastructure

Even though Bessemer hadn’t perfected the technology, he was able to benefit from it largely. Everything from railroads to the early skyscrapers lapped up steel as defence and construction industries put the material to good use.

The Bessemer process did not remove phosphorus and sulphur, two elements that could harm iron. Other processes that came in later were able to address these issues, but modern steel is still made using technology that is based on the Bessemer process.

As for Bessemer himself, he spent a lifetime inventing and innovating. He built a solar furnace, designed and built an astronomical telescope for his own use, produced a machine of advanced design that could crush sugarcane and extract its juice, and even built a vessel – the Bessemer Saloon Ship – to combat seasickness. Not all his attempts were successes (the SS Bessemer crashed into a pier on its first and only public voyage), but by the time Bessemer died in 1898, he had been knighted for his contributions to science, awarded the Fellowship of the Royal Society and notched up over a 100 patents.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/6vfvuw/article32813324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18istbSirHenryBessemerjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/bessemer-lays-the-foundation-for-steel/article32813325.ece
59,2020/10/18,Last rites to be streamed live from Shantikavadom,"Corporation to launch online booking service for reserving furnaces

In view of the restrictions to participation of relatives during cremation of those who died due to COVID-19, the city Corporation is set to launch live web streaming of the last rites ceremonies at the Shanthikavadom electric crematorium in Thycaud. The live streaming will be made available in the Smart Trivandrum webpage (www.smarttvm.corporationoftrivandrum.in), in the Shanthikavadom YouTube channel and its facebook page.

According to the Corporation authorities, quite a few people had expressed their wish to take part in the last rites ceremonies of their close relatives or friends. However, strict restrictions on the number of people allowed had prevented them from taking part. The live web streaming, which can be accessed from any part of the world, is being launched to address this issue.

Round the clock

An online software system will be implemented for reserving the furnaces. The booking will be through the Smart Trivandrum mobile application and web portal. Bookings can also be done through the Corporation’s call centre (contact - 9496434488) which will function round-the-clock or directly through Shanthikavadom (0471-2323574).

The cremation certificates from Shanthikavadom will henceforth be available online too. The name and details of the persons being cremated in the furnaces will be displayed in real-time in a display board at the front.

Officer appointed

The city Corporation has appointed a charge officer for overseeing the functioning of the crematorium (contact - 9496434410). The Smrithi mandapam located adjacent to the Shanthikavadom will be renovated to be used for memorial events. Work on two more gas furnaces is progressing, in addition to the existing two electric furnaces and four wood furnaces. Aerobic bins and a material recovery facility are also being arranged for the waste management at the facility.

62,2020/10/18,Shaky bridge across Uyyakondan Canal causes inconvenience to residents,"The 30-year-old bridge has begun developing cracks and accidents occur especially at night when there is low visibility.

A bridge across the Uyyakondan Canal near Pichai Nagar is a risky drive for two-wheelers. The bridge linking Duraisamypuram and Pichai Nagar is the path for reaching the Chennai Byepass Road.

The small bridge was constructed nearly 30 years ago after an effort was made by the local residents and members of a church nearby.

“For 30 years, it has not been strengthened and the retaining wall has fallen on one side. It is a big risk for pedestrians and two-wheeler riders,” said John Britto, who lives nearby.

The bridge has also begun developing cracks and accidents occur especially at night when there is low visibility. “There have been instances of riders falling into the water. It is like a mishap waiting to happen,” he said. Many factories and a shopping complex have also come up. Customers to these places take this route.

Functioning of TASMAC outlets on either side of the bridge adds to their woes. “Almost daily at least one drunk man slips and falls into the canal and has to be rescued. If they fall in the night, it could be dangerous,” another resident said.

When residents approached the Tiruchi City Corporation, they directed them to the Public Works Department. “They said that the reconstruction of the bridge is not under their purview. We are working on sending a representation to the PWD,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/k4a2bq/article32887076.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY19BRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/shaky-bridge-causes-inconvenience-to-residents/article32887077.ece

The 'Pandhakkal Nadum Vaibhavam' (the ceremony of installation of a holy wooden pole) in connection with the Vaikunta Ekadasi festival at the Srirangam Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple starting mid-December was held on the temple premises here on Sunday.

The ceremony held near the Thousand Pillar mandapam inside the sprawling temple complex in the morning was attended by the temple’s Joint Commissioner P. Jayaraman and a few staff of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department and trustees. Devotees were not present on the occasion. Rituals were performed and holy water sprinkled on the 'Pandhakkal' tied with flowers and mango leaves before being installed.

The annual Vaikunta Ekadasi festival this year commences on December 14 with 'Thirunedunthandakam' and concludes on January 4 with 'Nammazhwar Moksham'.

64,2020/10/18,Salai Road overbridge to get retaining wall soon,"Though the civic body has made temporary arrangements, the eroded portion is yet to be permanently repaired.

Tiruchi Corporation plans to utilise Smart Cities Mission fund to construct a retaining wall along the Salai Road over bridge as a portion of the approach road was eroded on a rainy night in July this year.

Though the civic body has made temporary arrangements, the eroded portion is yet to be permanently repaired.

The right-side retaining wall and a part of the road overbridge on Salai Road leading towards Mainguard Gate caved in after heavy rainfall amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

While the civic body used concrete, sack bags and wooden pillars to strengthen the sides to avoid further damage, a permanent solution is yet to be made.

An official of the State Highways said that a proposal for reconstruction of the bridge had been sent to the State government for approval. Once the approval was given, funds sanctioned under a redevelopment scheme would be allotted for the construction.

The civic body, meanwhile, has decided to strengthen the soil and construct a retaining wall.

“About ₹2.5 crore under the Smart Cities Mission fund will be utilised to fix the wall so that the bridge can be utilised until the plan submitted for redevelopment is approved,” City Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian said.

Since the damage to the overbridge, heavy vehicles, including buses ,are not allowed to travel on that route. A detour is taken via Karur Bypass Road to reach Mainguard Gate.

“What is usually a two-minute drive takes us at least 15 minutes due to the traffic on Karur-Bypass Road. The bridge was damaged amid the lockdown and the authorities could have repaired it before resumption of transport services,” R. Kalaivani, a commuter on the route said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/kyazze/article32883789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY18-SALAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/salai-road-overbridge-to-get-retaining-wall-soon/article32883792.ece
65,2020/10/18,Looking at issues involved in pilot initiative: CoP,"Exclusive lanes for two-wheelers on Bharathidasan Salai have not brought lane discipline

The city police move to introduce exclusive lanes for two-wheelers as a pilot initiative on Bharathidasan Salai in Tiruchi does not seem to have brought about the much needed lane discipline among motorists despite the best efforts of the traffic police.

City Police Commissioner J. Loganathan, who took charge in July, had outlined a plan in August to introduce exclusive lanes for two- wheelers in some of the arterial roads in the city in an attempt to curb accidents and to bring about lane discipline.

In a city notorious for lax traffic discipline and enforcement, the move was considered a welcome initiative by many.

Subsequently, police identified four arterial road stretches — Bharathidasan Salai (between Head Post Office to MGR statue), Head Post Office to Tiruchi railway junction, MGR statue to Uzhavar Sandhai, and MGR statue to Periyamilaguparai via District Collectorate — for creating to exclusive two wheeler lanes.

As a pilot initiative, markings for the two-wheelers lanes were made on both sides of Bharathidasan Salai and the traffic police started asking two-wheeler riders to ride within the lane.

After some initial enthusiasm, several two-wheeler riders could be seen riding outside the lane, which, some feel, were too narrow for the heavy two wheeler traffic in the city.

Some others complained about vehicles being parked in front of commercial establishments on the road, occupying the lane space.

“It is a bit difficult when all two-wheelers are moving on the narrow lane. We need to have some more space. Besides, no vehicle should be allowed to be parked on the lane,” said Vignesh, a young engineering graduate.

“It is a good initiative, but apparently there is lack of cooperation from motorists,” observed M. Sekaran, president, Federation of Consumers and Service Organisations and member of the District Road Safety Council.

Besides, the lanes were not adequate for two-wheeler population, which was the highest in the city. The city does not have wide enough roads for such exclusive lanes for two wheelers, he said pointing out that Bharathidasan Salai was one of the widest in the city and even here it was difficult to implement the concept.

Mr. Sekaran suggested that the city police could instead try and introduce bicycle lanes.

“Even I would like to ride a cycle, but am not sure of safety. If there were bicycle lanes, more people will take to them,” he said.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Loganathan did not agree with suggestions that the pilot initiative had not gone down well with the people.

“About 80-90% of motorists are using the lanes. We have also deployed police personnel to prevent parking on the lanes. The move will at least help reinforce the norm that two-wheelers should ride on the left side of the road, which will help reduce accidents,” the city police Commissioner contended.

He said the police were studying the issues involved in the pilot initiative and the inputs received from various quarters.

“We are looking at how best to adopt them and take it forward in other parts of the city,” Mr. Loganathan said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ht0ame/article32883692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY18-TWOWHEELER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/looking-at-issues-involved-in-pilot-initiative-cop/article32883693.ece
66,2020/10/18,I-League | Mohun Bagan officially crowned champion,"Fans take part in the trophy tour from hotel to the club’s official address

The Hero I-League trophy for the year 2019-20 was officially handed over to champion Mohun Bagan at a function organised in a city hotel here on Sunday.

With the COVID-19 pandemic halting the tournament and all other sports activities in the country, the official trophy presentation was delayed for around seven months after Mohun Bagan clinched the title with four rounds to spare.

Mohun Bagan has since then moved into ISL after merging with ISL champion ATK.

With the new entity replacing the team that won its last I-League crown, the function saw a reunion as some of the erstwhile Mohun Bagan players regrouped in the city to receive the trophy along with the officials of the club.

I-League CEO Sunando Dhar presented the trophy to Mohun Bagan.

Also present were West Bengal Sports Minister Aroop Biswas and Indian Football Association secretary Joydeep Mukherjee.

Dhar said that Mohun Bagan played the “best brand of football” and made it memorable by winning the title with a record four rounds to spare.

67,2020/10/18,Champions League | Condensed version set to kick off,"PSG and Manchester United clash on the opening day

A condensed version of the Champions League group stage finally gets under way on Tuesday, with COVID-19-related disruptions an ever-present threat hanging over the competition.

The 32-team contest will start one month later than usual, a knock-on effect of the pandemic interrupting last season for three months, although the group stage will finish as usual in early December with six match-days squeezed into a 50-day period.

It kicks off with a heavyweight clash between Paris St. Germain and Manchester United on Tuesday in Group H, bringing back memories of the English side’s comeback two seasons ago when it won on away goals after losing 2-0 at home.

Barcelona hosts Hungarians Ferencvaros, back in the group stage after a 25-year absence, in another Tuesday match, while Wednesday’s games include titleholder Bayern Munich v Atletico Madrid and Ajax v Liverpool.

UEFA settled on the new time-frame in early June when the pandemic appeared to be under control in Europe. But with the recent surge in infection numbers around the continent, it has begun to look increasingly ambitious.

Ronaldo to miss opener

Cristiano Ronaldo is among the players who have tested positive recently, and he will miss Juventus’ opening match away to Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday.

The Portuguese could also be forced to sit out the following week’s match at home to Barcelona, when he is due to face his old rival Lionel Messi for the first time in over two years.

UEFA has drawn up a detailed health protocol which, in principle, allows teams to play even if members of the squad test positive.

As long as a team has a minimum of 13 available players including one goalkeeper, matches can go ahead.

Clubs will also be allowed to field players who were not initially registered for the competition to make up the numbers.

However, UEFA recognises that national authorities could intervene and order an entire team into quarantine, as happened in a European under-21 qualifier between Iceland and Italy.

Forfeiting matches

UEFA’s rules say that teams may have to forfeit matches in the Champions League, particularly if they fail to inform it of restrictions imposed by local authorities on either themselves or the visiting team.

However, UEFA says it may also reschedule matches in some cases and has set a deadline of Jan. 28 for them to be played, giving clubs a potential seven-week extension to complete their fixtures.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/f2e4sy/article32887471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19BAYERN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/champions-league-condensed-version-set-to-kick-off/article32887472.ece
68,2020/10/18,Euro leagues | Spain’s big two left blushing pink,"Cadiz puts one over Real; Getafe gets the better of Barcelona

Real Madrid and Barcelona each wore pink jerseys in their respective games on Saturday in LaLiga but the unusual fashion experiment did not turn out well for either side.

Madrid, which wore its pink kit to show support for World Breast Cancer day, fell to a shock 1-0 defeat at home to promoted Cadiz, while a few miles down the road Barcelona, also sporting pink, then lost 1-0 at Getafe.

It was the first time the two giants of Spanish football had both lost league matches on the same day without scoring since May 6, 2000, when Barca went down 2-0 to Rayo Vallecano and Madrid was beaten 1-0 by Alaves.

Weaknesses

The twin results showcased both side’s weaknesses at the worst possible time, a week before they meet each other in the ‘Clasico’, Spanish football’s showcase game.

Talk of Antoine Griezmann’s best position had dominated the build-up to Barca’s game.

The Frenchman’s grievances looked woefully out of place, however, when a glorious chance fell his way early in the game only for him to blast the ball way over the bar.

Harrowing first half

Real coach Zinedine Zidane has long been an advocate of rotating his squad to keep his top players sharp, but the harrowing first half display against Cadiz showed this policy is now fraught with risk.

The Frenchman hauled off three players plus an injured Sergio Ramos at the start of the second half after his side had conceded five clear chances to Cadiz and he later remarked that Madrid was lucky to not be 3-0 down by halftime.

The results:

Premier League: Sheffield United 1 (Sharp 85-pen) drew with Fulham 1 (Lookman 77).

Serie A: Bologna 3 (Soriano 9, Svanberg 39, Orsolini 60) lost to Sassuolo 4 (Berardi 18, Djuricic 64, Caputo 70, Tomiyasu 77-og).

LaLiga: Eibar 0 drew with Osasuna 0.

Saturday: Premier League: Manchester City 1 (Sterling 23) bt Arsenal 0; Newcastle 1 (Shaw 2-og) lost to Manchester United 4 (Maguire 23, Fernandes 86, Wan-Bissaka 90, Rashford 90+6).

69,2020/10/18,Raheem Sterling strike sinks Arsenal as Man City keeps it tight,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta had clearly prepared his side well tactically and they looked solid, despite losing defender Rob Holding to injury during the warm-up.

Manchester City's Raheem Sterling condemned Arsenal to their second defeat of the season as he fired his side to a 1-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League on Saturday.

Sterling slotted home in the 23rd minute after a Phil Foden shot was parried out by visiting keeper Bernd Leno, at the end of a flowing City counter-attack.

The England forward was skippering the City team in the absence of their injured Belgium midfielder Kevin De Bruyne.

“They were a difficult team to break down, really well drilled and made it difficult for us. In the end we deserved the win. We kept it tight and compact and deserved the win,” said Sterling.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who took over at the London club after working under Pep Guardiola at City, had clearly prepared his side well tactically and they looked solid, despite losing defender Rob Holding to injury during the warm-up.

Arsenal created several openings in the first half but twice City keeper Ederson was alert and quick off his line, foiling Bakary Sako and then Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

City's back four, with Ruben Dias partnering Nathan Ake in the centre of defence, looked much more solid than in the opening games of the campaign.

Arsenal's new signing, Ghana midfielder Thomas Partey from Atletico Madrid, made his first appearance for the Gunners off the bench with seven minutes remaining.

District Collector V. Vinay Chand said that the embankments of Varaha river will be strengthened to check inundation problem.

The Collector along with Payakaraopeta MLA Golla Babu Rao on Saturday visited Somudevapalli village at S Rayavaram and inspected the embankments of the river and the damages caused by the rains.

Mr. Vinay Chand examined Varaha river basin and enquired why the embankments were washed off.

The Collector directed the officials concerned to take all the necessary measures to temporarily resolve the issue at the earliest so that the residents in the nearby areas do not get affected.

The Collector later held a review meeting with the officials and asked them to prepare design for strong embankments that would withstand further rains that may cause flood-like situation.

Mr. Vinay Chand instructed the Superintending Engineer to submit a complete report on the issue and the changes in the breakwater design which led to the washing off of the embankments. The Collector has also informed that a loss to the tune of ₹70 crore was estimated as the crops were inundated due to heavy rains in the district.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/baow4j/article32883996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VZ-VARAHARIVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/embankments-of-varaha-river-will-be-strengthened-collector/article32883997.ece

76,2020/10/18,Tension prevails as civic body officials demolish ‘illegal’ shops,"Locals supported by TDP MLA try to stop the activity

Officials from the Town Planning wing of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) demolished 15 shops which were allegedly set up in land belonging to the Irrigation Department and by encroaching the footpaths, near Andhra University area, here on Saturday.

Tension prevailed as huge police force was deployed when the locals tried to stop the demolition activity by the GVMC officials. Visakhapatnam (East) MLA V. Ramakrishna Babu reached the spot immediately after coming to know about the demolition activity. There were heated exchanges between the locals supported by the MLA and the officials.

‘No notices’

The residents claimed that they have been living in the locality for more than 25 years and the civic body demolished shops without serving notices. “It was around 4 a.m. when the officials came here and started demolishion. Neither they showed us any demolition orders, nor they gave us time to take out our belongings from the shop,” alleged Ch. Venkanna, who runs a photocopying shop and also resides there.

M. Sathyavathi, who is a resident and runs a sugarcane juice point, said that they have been living here for the last 25 years and the land issue was pending with the court.

“Along with our lawyer, we had asked the GVMC officials to stop demolition. They did not listen,” she said.

“We were not served any notices before as claimed by the civic body officials. This is our only source of living. Now where shall we go and how do we live?” she questioned.

M. Ramana, who runs a tea point and photocopying shop over there, said that more than 20 families and nearly 100 persons were affected and lost source of income. There are a number of women living here, he said.

A few students who regularly visit the tea stalls, tiffin shop and the photocopying centre, expressed their solidarity with the shopkeepers.

Mr. Ramakrishna Babu said that if the YSR Congress Party wants to target him, they should do it directly. But it is unfair to target innocent people in his constituency who support him, he said

According to GVMC Chief City Planner R.J. Vidyullatha, they have received a representation from the Irrigation Department officials that some part of their land has been encroached near Andhra University. They also received complaints from students of Andhra University girls hostel that anti-social activities were taking place near the shops, as their hostel is located nearby, she said

The CCP also said that the vendors had encroached the government land and the shops were also spilling on to the road side.

Ms. Vidyullatha also said that if there are people below the poverty line, they can apply for a shop/kiosk following GVMC procedures and they can get an alternative place.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/l9haws/article32883903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VZ-SHOPKEEPERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/tension-prevails-as-civic-bodyofficials-demolish-illegal-shops/article32883904.ece

Apparel exports logged double-digit growth in September, which indicates the segment is on course to a V-shaped recovery, apparel exporters’ body AEPC said on Saturday.

Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) chairman A. Sakthivel said apparel exports rose for the first time this fiscal in September and the steep recovery from 90% fall in April to 10% rise last month “corroborates our belief that the apparel sector is already on the path of V-shaped recovery.”

He added that steps taken by the government are helping the sector to deal with the problems related to the pandemic. Exports saw a growth of 10.2% in September 2020 to $1.2 billion as compared with $1.079 billion in the same month a year earlier. “We believe this turnaround with a positive growth of more than 10% will only increase as we go forward in the second half of the fiscal,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/wyz1dk/article32883051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THBUEXPORTS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/apparel-exports-on-path-to-a-v-shaped-recovery/article32883052.ece
79,2020/10/18,Rights of domestic workers in focus post-lockdown,"Many were denied salaries, lost jobs and faced harassment from employers

The denial of salaries and loss of employment faced by domestic workers as well as harassment by employers and Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) meted out to them following the nationwide lockdown has brought into focus the need for safeguarding their rights. They have now brought out a manifesto demanding universal registration of employers and domestic workers and national comprehensive legislation.

A survey conducted in Bengaluru among 2,400 domestic workers during the first two weeks of May showed that 87% of the workers were told not to come to work after the lockdown and were not sure when they would be called to work. A staggering 91% of workers lost their salaries for April. It also found that nearly 50% of those above the age of 50 also lost their jobs during the lockdown. The study was conducted by the Domestic Workers Rights Union (DWRU), the Bruhat Bangalore Gruhakarmika Sangha (BBGS), and the Manegelasa Kaarmikara Union.

Another telephonic survey conducted in New Delhi by the Institute of Social Studies Trust with 35 women workers between April 23 and 28 recorded that nearly 83% of women reported severe to moderate economic crises as well as anxiety over job security. At the same time, responsibilities for handling domestic chores at their own homes and procuring daily essentials increased as police targeted men for violating lockdown rules. As many as 51% women also spoke about challenges in buying milk, vegetables and dry ration due to price hike and 57% are worried about paying rent.

Financial responsibilities

The report also shows that women employed as domestic workers often bear a disproportionate burden of not just unpaid work at their own homes, but also financial responsibilities. As many as 51% workers surveyed had unemployed spouses and 36% were divorced, separated or widowed women.

Also read: Domestic workers ignored during pandemic, says union

About 17 organisations and unions who work in Delhi-NCR joined hands to form the Network of Rights and Voices of Domestic Workers and to ensure the well-being of these women. They held discussions with domestic workers to prepare a manifesto of demands which calls for a minimum cash transfer to domestic workers under the National Disaster Management Act, universal registration of employers and domestic workers, national legislation, an urban employment guarantee scheme and strengthening of Local Committees at the district level where workers can complain about sexual harassment at workplace.

“We engaged with district magistrates asking them to frame Standard Operating Protocols for domestic workers in their districts and to issue directions to RWAs to ensure better working conditions and job security. We have also shared a list of suggestions with parliamentarians and pressed for the need to include domestic workers under the social security code and board, better implementation of the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act, 2013 and a comprehensive legislation for domestic workers,” explains Shruti Batra, Project Manager, Jagori.

She adds that in the days to come the network will also hold discussions with RWAs and employers on the need for improving employer-employee relations and safer workplaces for domestic workers.

As per NSS 2005, there are 4.75 million domestic workers in the country, but this is likely to be a gross under-estimation. According to Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), the actual figure could be as high as 50 million domestic workers in India. Yet they are no social security schemes specifically geared towards their needs. The recently passed Labour Code on Social Security does not cover households. As a result, domestic workers cannot avail of any social security and insurance benefits, provident fund, maternity benefit or gratuity. Also, the Code on Wages passed last covers domestic workers employed in houses with more than five workers, and therefore excludes a vast majority of these women.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ti4mn9/article32887622.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THMAID-INDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rights-of-domestic-workers-in-focus-post-lockdown/article32887623.ece

The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) seems to be divided over a resolution passed by its executive committee which “strongly condemned” Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy for releasing into the public domain his letter to the Chief Justice of India against apex court judge, Justice N.V. Ramana.

Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, SCBA president, has conveyed to advocate Rohit Pandey, Honorary Secretary of the Association, that he is strongly opposed to the resolution “on principle.”

The Hindu Explains | What can CJI Bobde do about charges levelled against judges by the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister?

Mr. Pandey told The Hindu that the resolution was passed “unanimously” and Mr. Dave had “recused.”

In his communication to the SCBA secretary, Mr. Dave said it was “premature” to pass such a resolution.

“The letter of the Chief Minister is addressed to Honbl’e the CJI and seeks an inquiry into allegations against a sitting Supreme Court judge. We have no idea about the truthfulness or otherwise of those allegations. Truth will emerge once the inquiry, if any is done. At this stage we would be pre-empting the inquiry,” he wrote.

Comment | A constitutional pickle of the Andhra kind

He said, “I am sure at the end of inquiry, truth will emerge and if allegations are found false, SC must initiate proceedings against the CM. Today it is premature to pass the resolution much less of the kind you all propose.”

In its resolution passed on October 16, the SCBA Executive Committee had referred to Mr. Reddy’s decision to make the letter public and said “such actions by constitutional functionaries are opposed to conventions, causing serious inroads impacting the independence of the judiciary as enshrined in the Constitution of India”.

The Congress on Sunday accused the BJP of reducing politics to dukaandari (commercial transaction) and claimed that the party’s former MLAS, who had defected to the BJP earlier this year, have now openly admitted to “receiving diverse offers in the past”.

Addressing a virtual press conference, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi demanded a judicial inquiry by a sitting Supreme Court or a High Court judge and the filing of charges against defectors under the Prevention of Corruption Act and criminal charges under the Indian Penal Code.

“They have eliminated the distinction between Dukandari and political fighting of battles,” he said.

The allegations come just ahead of the crucial November 3 byelections in Gujarat in which eight constituencies will go to vote after their MLAs had resigned in February-March.

“The people of India elect legislators for a minimum of five years. The BJP ensures that the constitutional and democratic mandate is actually a mandate of only 2 or 3 years. It is curtailed, interrupted, obstructed to 2-3 years by large sums of money, large number of resignations, offering of ministerships and MLA tickets,” Mr. Singhvi alleged. “The government, instead of focusing on fighting COVID or China, spends all its energies on allowing such things.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eyl9ej/article32887398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABHISHEKMANUSINGHVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-reducing-politics-to-commercial-transactions-says-cong/article32887390.ece

Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the government over the three farm laws, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic slowdown and alleged atrocities against Dalits, while claiming that Indian democracy is passing through its “most difficult phase”.

Also read: Sonia Gandhi asks Cong.-ruled States to bring in their own farm laws

A “conspiracy” has been hatched to defeat the gains of the ‘green revolution’, she alleged, slamming the government over the three “anti-agriculture black laws”.

Addressing a meeting of AICC general secretaries and State-incharges which she presided over, Ms. Gandhi also alleged that the country was being ruled by a government which was “systematically” handing over the rights of citizens to a handful of crony capitalists.

This was the first meeting of general secretaries and State in-charges Sonia Gandhi chaired after a major organisational reshuffle last month.

Hitting out at the government over the recently passed farm laws, she said the BJP-led dispensation has attacked the very foundation of India’s resilient agrarian economy by bringing in “three anti-agriculture black laws”.

“A conspiracy has been hatched to defeat the gains of the ‘green revolution’ Lives and livelihoods of crores of farm labourers, leasehold farmers, small and marginal farmers, toiling labourers and small shopkeepers are under attack. It is our solemn duty to join hands to defeat this sinister conspiracy,” Ms. Gandhi asserted.

The three farm bills — the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 — were passed by Parliament recently. Subsequently, President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the bills.

The Congress, many other opposition parties and several farmers organisations have been protesting against these legislations, claiming that these will harm the interests of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government. The Centre has asserted that these new laws will be beneficial for farmers and will increase their income.

Alleging that the country’s democracy is passing through its “most difficult phase”, Ms. Gandhi claimed there is a “designed attack” on the Constitution and democratic traditions.

Also read: Stop looking at J&K parties as secessionists, says Chidambaram

The country was pushed into the “abyss” of coronavirus pandemic by “sheer ineptitude” and “mismanagement” of the Modi government, Ms. Gandhi alleged in her opening remarks at the meeting.

“All this happened as we witnessed the biggest unplanned and cruel migration of crores of migrant labourers as the government remained a mute spectator to their miseries. The stark truth is that a prime minister who promised to defeat corona within 21 days has abdicated his and his government’s responsibility towards the citizens,” Ms. Gandhi said.

There is neither a plan nor strategic thinking, solution or a way ahead in the fight against the pandemic, she alleged in her address in Hindi.

Ms. Gandhi claimed that the government has simultaneously “demolished” the economy, built painstakingly by the hard work of fellow Indians and the vision of successive Congress governments.

“Never has the country witnessed such a free-fall in GDP as also all other economic indices. Today, the young have no jobs. Nearly 14 crore jobs have been lost. Small and medium businesses, small shopkeepers and other small enterprises are shutting at an unprecedented pace, yet an uncaring government remains a mute spectator,” the Congress President said.

She also accused the government of failing to honour even its Constitutional responsibilities, saying the share of GST compensation is being denied to States.

“How will the State governments help our people, if the government of India was to renege on its Constitutional obligations? This must be a first example of economic anarchy being spread by the central government,” Ms. Gandhi said.

Alleging that atrocities against Dalits have reached a “new zenith”, she said that instead of honouring the law and granting adequate protection to India’s daughters, BJP governments are siding with criminals.

“The voice of oppressed families is being suppressed by the agencies of the State. Is this the new ‘Raj Dharma’?” Mr. Gandhi asked.

She exhorted the general secretaries and State in-charges to take on these challenges and stand with the people, saying this is what defines the Congress organisation.

“I am confident that all of you would toil hard and stand up to the forces attacking India and its people. Let us join hands to defeat the anti-democracy and autocratic designs of the ruling BJP,” she said.

84,2020/10/18,"Congress, BJP get into spat over Shashi Tharoor tweet","Thiruvananthapuram MP criticised the Narendra Modi government at Lahore Think Fest event.

The Congress on Sunday accused the BJP of resorting to jumlebaazi (empty rhetoric) after BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra charged paty’s Lok Sabha member Shashi Tharoor with “discrediting and demeaning” India at the Lahore Think Fest event and asked if Congress leaders now plan to contest elections in Pakistan.

At a virtual press conference, Congress MP and spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi hit back by accusing the BJP of “ridiculing the debate and diminish India as a democracy”.

“The BJP has always responded to substance and pointed facts with jumlebaazi. The BJP has always believed in rhetoric, not substance. Yes, it does sometimes catch you by the eyeballs or the earbuds when you hear it, but, within seconds, logic takes over and tells you how empty a rhetoric the BJP is indulging in,” Mr. Singhvi told reporters.

The BJP spokesperson attacked the Congress after Mr. Tharoor had shared the link to the event, one that reportedly took place last month, on his official twitter handle on Saturday.

In the online interaction, Mr. Tharoor spoke about the Narendra Modi government’s ‘failure’ in effectively handling the COVID-19 situation and the prejudice against a community during the pandemic.

“It is unbelievable that an MP spoke like this...After all, what does the Congress party want. Do they want to contest elections from Pakistan?” asked Mr. Patra and added that Mr. Tharoor also questioned the democratic credentials of the country.

“What was the need to discuss such matters at a Pakistani forum? There is no country in this world as democratic and just as India,” he said.

The BJP spokesperson also claimed that former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi is already hailed as a ‘hero’ in China and Pakistan because of his statements against the Modi government.

Hitting back, Mr. Singhvi said, “If somebody is praising a particular achievement or pointing to a particular area of activity in which you are laggard in India, to call that person to stand for elections from Pakistan is to ridicule the debate and diminish us as a democracy.

“These responses might have short-lived, few seconds of utility but they actually show the hollowness of your intellectual ability to deal in areas where you are a complete failure.”

85,2020/10/18,"Jagan vs. judges | Andhra Pradesh CM’s letter an affront to judiciary, says ex-Supreme Court judge","Matter should have been taken to CJI confidentially, says Justice Gopal Gowda

Former Supreme Court judge V. Gopala Gowda has described the letter sent by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to the Supreme Court Chief Justice of India regarding the alleged misconduct conduct of Justice N.V. Ramana and some judges of Andhra Pradesh (AP) High Court as an “affront to a vibrant judiciary”.

“The Chief Justice of India (CJI) has to apply his mind to the matter and then take appropriate action,” he observed in an email interview to The Hindu.

Justice Gowda (retd.) said the letter was unprecedented, particularly in view of the manner of its release in the public domain and the allegations levelled against Justice Ramana as well as the Chief Justice and other judges of A.P. High Court. An independent judiciary was not only an important wing of constitutional democracy but also the very sentinel of the rule of law and good governance, he said.

‘Dignity compromised’

The letter and its public disclosure not only compromised the dignity, independence and majesty of the apex court and the A.P. High Court but has also, consequently, interfered with administration of justice and scandalised the court in the eyes of the people by sensationalising the issue, Justice Gowda said.

Also read: Advocates slam Jagan Mohan Reddy’s letter to CJI

Stating that the manner of the letter’s release at a press conference was coloured by severe impropriety, he said it appears that sensationalising the issue was the priority and not a genuine quest for truth of the matter.

As far as accusing Justice Ramana and some judges of the High Court of nepotism is concerned, Justice Gowda said the judges named in the CM's letter are critical functionaries discharging sacrosanct functions under the Constitution.

Needs evidence

Aspersions and allegations against them ought not to be made lightly for sensationalism without substantive and positive evidence. Nothing short of the faith of the people in the judiciary and the rule of law is at stake.

The majesty of the judiciary has never been more fragile ever since the unprecedented press conference addressed by four former judges of the apex court, he added.

Justice Gowda said: “Article 121 and Article 211 of the Constitution expressly bar the Parliament and State Legislatures to discuss the conduct of any Judge. The Constitution confers such immunity having regard to the onerous responsibility of judges in discharging constitutional functions. The matter at hand must be seen in this context.”

Asked if the Chief Minister's letter amounted to contempt of court as is being argued by a section of the legal fraternity, Justice Gowda said it is subject to a decision by the CJI on the touchstone of the applicable contempt law(s) in the country.

Timing of letter

Regarding suspicions about the timing of the letter, the intentions behind it and the fears that the judiciary has been deliberately dragged into the political muddle, Justice Gowda responded: “I understand that as a matter of fact, a number of cases, including criminal cases, are pending against the CM as on date before courts of law. Timing of the letter and sensationalising the issue ostensibly casts a doubt on the motive.”

“Such being the immunity and privileges conferred on judges by the Constitution, it is highly unfortunate that politics took the discussion on constitutional functionaries to social media making a circus out of it all,” he said.

Justice Gowda said the CM should have taken up the matter confidentially with CJI, not in the way the issue was raked up publicly.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bvqn11/article32886825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GOWDAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh-cms-letter-an-affront-to-judiciary-says-ex-supreme-court-judge/article32886826.ece
86,2020/10/18,Government deliberating special card for transgenders to link them to welfare schemes,"The Centre had constituted the National Council for Transgender Persons to formulate policies, programmes and draft legislations for the community in August.

The government is deliberating on making a special identity card for transgender community members that will help in liking them with various social welfare schemes, a member of the recently-constituted National Council for Transgender Persons said.

The Centre had in August constituted the National Council for Transgender Persons (NCTP) to formulate policies, programmes, draft legislation and projects regarding members of the community for achieving equality and full participation by them.

The first meeting of the NCTP was held through video conference on Thursday. It was chaired by Social Justice Minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot.

Meera Parida, a member of the transgender community, representing the east region in the council, said discussions were held on various issues faced by the community in the hour-long meeting.

“Discussions were also held on introducing a transgender identity card that will link with them the social welfare schemes for the community. There will be a transgender identity card which will be linked to social welfare schemes. The plan has not been finalised yet but deliberations were held on the identity card,” Mx. Parida said.

Mx. Parida, the BJD’s Odisha state secretary, further said making such a card is one of the demands of the community and it will help in their upliftment.

“India is the first country which has taken such a step to form a department and a council for the community. The government is taking the transgender community forward and trying its best to remove the social stigma associated with the community members,” Mx. Parida said.

88,2020/10/18,Women soldiers check drug smuggling through LoC,"Two major recoveries made since they were deployed at Sadhna Pass, at an altitude of over 10,000 feet.

Nine riflewomen of the para-military force Assam Rifles were deployed at the Sadhna Pass earlier called the Nastachun Pass on the Kupwara-Tangdhar highway in July this year, the first women soldiers in combat functioning under the Army, as part of a series of steps taken recently to contain smuggling of narcotics from across the Line of Control (LoC).

With a series of measures, close to 80 kg narcotics, mostly brown sugar, was seized in the Tangdhar sector alone this year, a senior officer deployed in the sector near the LoC said. Last year too, a little less than 80 kg narcotics was seized. Officials also raised concern on several villages ahead of the border fence which are used as safe grounds to abet smuggling.

“The anti-narcotics grid has been strengthened with women soldiers, narco dogs and x-ray machines. If someone can bring narcotics, tomorrow they can also bring fake currency and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED),” the officer said. Narcotics smuggling has been going for sometime but the recoveries increased significantly in the last two years, he said.

In addition, checking is carried at various points and intelligence-based operations are being carried out to search and siege narcotics. The nine women soldiers were deployed at the pass at over 10,000 feet and three of them are on duty at any point of time, another officer said. There were two major narcotic recoveries since they were inducted and they underwent a special 21-day orientation capsule at the 15 Corps Battle school before deployment.

The riflewomen handle all women-related tasks and have separate accommodation and wash rooms within the camp, the second officer said. “They are acting as a major deterrent. Earlier we used to get specific intelligence that a certain woman was carrying narcotics. But we couldn’t do anything,” he said.

Talking about her experience, Riflewoman Nitu Kumari from Bihar said the local population was happy to see women soldiers. “They share their issues with us. Their children are inspired by us,” she said talking to a small group of journalists at the Sadhna Pass.

Riflewoman H Wanjen Konyek from Nagaland and the seniormost of the woman soldiers said it was a good experience. On the challenges they faced, she said, “Weather is getting cold and that’s challenging.” Some women soldiers have been deployed at couple of other locations in Kashmir for similar duties.

Four narco dogs have been inducted in the Tangdhar Brigade under the Assam Rifles and the BSF. At the Sadhna pass, x-ray machines have also been installed which have simplified screening of baggage. Local government and police officials too expressed concern on the growing narco smuggling and trade. The cost of the narcotic substances goes up exponentially as they cross the LoC into North Kashmir and to South Kashmir and further to rest of India and this indirectly funds terrorism, an officer said.

Villages beyond border fence

Along the LoC, there are several villages which are ahead of the border fence. For instance, there are 12 such villages in the Tangdhar sector. In addition, there are several naalas where there is no fence which create gaps making monitoring tough. “When people are staying close to the fence, smuggling is possible,” another officer said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/271apg/article32887710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SadhnaPassjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/narcotics-smuggling-women-soldiers-act-as-major-deterrent/article32886372.ece

The Minister said this during an interaction with his social media followers on the sixth episode of “Sunday Samvaad”.

He was responding to a question from a participant, who cited West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s remark that there are instances of community transmission in her State and asked the Minister which are the States that have witnessed community transmission of the disease.

“In different pockets across various States, including West Bengal, community transmission of COVID-19 is expected to occur, especially in densely-populated areas,” she had stated.

“However, this is not happening across the country. Community transmission is limited to certain districts, occurring in a limited number of States,” Dr. Vardhan said.

He added that as yet, no mutation of the coronavirus has been detected in India that is either more transmission-efficient or more pathogenic.

The Centre so far has denied community transmission of the coronavirus infection in the country.

90,2020/10/18,Congress readies protest road map,"Sonia Gandhi says Narendra Modi abdicated his responsibility in the fight against COVID-19.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi targeted the Narendra Modi-led BJP government for alleged atrocities against Dalits and women, passing anti-farmer ‘black’ laws, ‘demolishing’ the economy and accused Prime Minister Modi of ‘abdicating’ his responsibility in the fight against COVID-19.

At a virtual meeting of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretaries and State-incharges, Ms. Gandhi said India was passing through a “tumultuous phase” in which the rights of the citizens are being ‘systematically’ handed over to a handful of crony capitalists.

Also read: Congress focus on Gwalior-Chambal, COVID-19 relief in Madhya Pradesh by-poll manifesto

This was the first meeting of the general secretaries and incharges after the Congress had carried out a major organisational reshuffle last month.

The party prepared a roadmap of various agitational programmes against the farm laws and the growing incidents of violence against Dalits and women. It includes a plan to petition President Ram Nath Kovind by submitting two crore signatures of farmers against the new farm laws on November 19, the birth anniversary of Indira Gandhi.

“Atrocities on Dalits have reached a new zenith. Instead of honouring the law and granting adequate protection to India’s daughters, the BJP governments are siding with the criminals. The voice of oppressed families is being suppressed by the agencies of the State. Is this the new ‘Raj Dharma’?” Ms. Gandhi asked.

Bihar Assembly elections

The Congress chief’s comment comes in the backdrop of the party’s aggressive stance over the Hathras incident in which a 19-year Dalit girl was allegedly raped and murdered.

Attacking the Modi government over the farm laws, she accused the government of hatching a ‘conspiracy’ to undo the gains of the Green Revolution.

“Lives and livelihoods of crores of farm labourers, lease hold farmers, small and marginal farmers, toiling labourers and small shopkeepers are under attack. It is our solemn duty to join hands to defeat this sinister conspiracy.”

She accused the Modi government of pushing the country into “an abyss with its ineptitude” in dealing with COVID-19 and its impact on the economy.

“The stark truth is that a Prime Minster, who promised to defeat corona within 21 days, has abdicated his and his govt.’s responsibility towards the citizens. There is neither a plan nor strategic thinking, solution or way ahead in the fight against corona.”

The Congress chief accused the Modi government of ‘demolishing’ the economy that had been “painstakingly built by fellow Indians and successive Congress governments”.

“Never has the country witnessed such a free-fall in GDP as also all other economic indices. Today, the young have no jobs. Nearly 14 crore jobs have been lost. Small and medium businesses, small shopkeepers and other small enterprises are shutting at an unprecedented pace, yet an uncaring government remains a mute spectator,” Ms. Gandhi said.

On October 31, Kisan Adhikar Diwas (Farmers’ Rights Day) will be observed through a day-long fast to coincide with the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and the martyrdom day of Indira Gandhi. There will be nationwide protests over the alleged atrocities on women, Dalits and farmers on November 5.

Between November 1 and 10, there will be daily tractor rallies against the farm laws. An online campaign for public sector undertakings and symposiums on Nehruvian ideology will be organised on November 14 to mark the birth anniversary of first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a1rkoq/article32888374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SONIAGANDHIjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sonia-gandhi-asks-congress-leaders-to-wage-struggle-for-peoples-issues/article32886248.ece
91,2020/10/18,NIA files charge sheet against 12 including 9 Bangladeshis in international human trafficking case,"The 12 accused hatched a criminal conspiracy along with their associates in Bangladesh.

The NIA has filed a charge sheet against 12 people, including nine Bangladeshi nationals, for their alleged involvement in trafficking girls from across the border for prostitution, an official said.

The charge sheet was filed under sections of the IPC, the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act and the Foreigners Act in a special NIA court in Hyderabad on Saturday.

Ruhul Amin Dhali of West Bengal, Asad Hasan and Shareeful Shaik of Maharashtra have been named along with Bangladeshi nationals — Mohd Yousuf Khan, Bithi Begum, Mohd Rana Hussain, Mohammed Al Mamun, Sojib Shaik, Suresh Kumar Das, Mohd Abdulla Munshi, Mohd Ayub Shaik and absconding accused Abdul Barik Shaik.

The case was originally registered under sections of the IPC and the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act on September 21 last year at Pahadishareef police station in Hyderabad following the arrest of 10 human traffickers on the same day from two brothels in Hyderabad.

Four young Bangladeshi girls were rescued from the brothels and several digital devices, fake Indian identity documents and other incriminating material were seized, the NIA spokesperson said.

The NIA investigation established that the arrested accused were associates of Dhali and Abdul Barik Shaik who illegally trafficked young girls from Bangladesh to India and vice versa, according to the official.

Dhali was arrested by the NIA in another case. Further probe revealed that there were money transfers between Dhali and Shaik as commission paid to Dhali for trafficking across the borders, the official said.

Dhali and other 10 arrested accused had illegally entered India in the 1980’s and established a prostitution racket along with Yusuf and Bithi, who are husband and wife, in various parts of India, the NIA spokesperson said.

These girls are lured with promise of lucrative jobs and better life quality. They are also provided fake Indian identity documents and are eventually forced into prostitution, the NIA official said.

The rescued young girls are presently at shelter homes and the arrested accused are in judicial custody in Hyderabad.

92,2020/10/18,"Coronavirus | In rush for ‘immunity’, Ayurveda supplements have an untested run","Companies marketing these products have capitalised on the association between COVID-19 and immunity.

For a chemist shop that’s usually lined with pharmaceutical drugs, Noida-based proprietor Mahesh Agrawal prominently displays his containers of Dabur Chyawanprash. “There’s a lot of demand for them along with honey and sales have increased ever since the unlockdown began.”

Multiple grocers and stores that sell organic-labelled products say they have been seeing a sharp demand for products that are even tangentially linked to “boosting immunity”.

Coronavirus | Indian Medical Association voices concern over Harsh Vardhan’s pitch for Ayush treatment for COVID-19

Amul markets turmeric-flavoured milk called Amul “Haldi Doodh,” that purports to having the “goodness of milk with the centuries old immunity boosting and healing properties of haldi”.

Rising sentiment

A July report by market research company Nielsen says chyawanprash sales have increased by 283% in June, while the sales of branded honey increased by 39%. “There is a rising sentiment towards ‘local’ with increasing support for Atma Nirbhar Bharat and Ayurveda,” the report said.

“From April-June, we saw a nearly 7-fold growth in demand [compared to last year] for Dabur Chyawanprash. Other Ayurvedic products like Ashwagandha, Dabur Giloy Ghanvati, Dabur Health Juices like Amla juice, Giloy-Neem-Tulsi Juice etc, have also reported strong growth,” Mohit Malhotra, CEO, Dabur India, told The Hindu. “People are now more inclined to prophylactic health remedies, especially immunity boosting products. This trend would sustain, going forward.”

Coronavirus | Consumption of ayurvedic medicines/products up during pandemic: Ayush Ministry

Shoppers told The Hindu that while they didn’t believe immunity products would protect them from COVID-19, they saw it as a way to bolster their immune defences. “I regularly take chyawanprash but will never go to an Ayurveda doctor,” said Swapan Banerjee, a teacher. “These products do no harm and play a role in general good health, from my experience but aren’t substitutes for masks, social distancing, avoiding crowds and getting tested.”

Companies that have been marketing these products have capitalised on the association between COVID-19 and immunity and the government’s encouragement of Ayurveda and yoga for mild and moderate infections as well for aiding recovery post COVID-19.

An 11-member committee led by former ICMR chief recommended that in the “short term... “Guduchi(Tinospora cordifolia) aqueous extract, guduchi+pippali (Piper longum), aqueous extracts and AYUSH 64 (a drug with multiple herbs developed by the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences) be recommended for inclusion in the standard care for mild to moderate cases of COVID-19”.

Coronavirus | Centre seeks details of AYUSH drug

However, a perusal of the research studies listed show that none of them have been fully tested for their effectiveness in COVID management and all the evidence relies on the herbs’ effects in controlling fever in malaria and in recovery from “influenza like illnesses”.

High binding efficacy

Ashwagandha has been recommended by the committee because laboratory studies show that it “inhibited the entry” of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses into healthy cells and guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) showed “high binding efficacy” against SARS-CoV-2 targets involved in attachment and replication of the virus, compared to Favipiravir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir.”

Coronavirus | Highly irresponsible on the part of AYUSH Ministry to prescribe Unani medicines

However unlike the latter, these haven’t been tested in controlled, comparative trials. In fact, the most recent human trials show that all of the drugs that in lab studies showed promising anti-viral activity but weren’t significantly effective in improving disease outcomes.

The viral cells, as it is now understood, infiltrate the lung cells and multiply. The SARS-CoV-2, scientists say, is particularly sneaky and the body’s immune system is frequently unable to detect these viral particles early on to neutralise them and keep them proliferating. As has been seen in instances of those suffering a severe infection, the immune system goes into an overdrive. The body is deluged by chemical messengers called cytokines that, while alerting the body’s defence cells to destroy the virus, also trigger inflammation in multiple organs. It’s to stem such over-reaction, that many a time ends up being fatal, that steroids such as dexamethason are administered.

Thus the holy grail of COVID treatment is to ensure that immune system fights the virus without going berserk.

Complex mix of herbs

In the Ayurveda system, chyawanprash is a “complex mix of herbs” and several common herbs — like turmeric, black pepper and ginger infusions contribute in varying measures to keeping the immune system in a state of preparedness against fighting pathogens, said an expert.

“Turmeric, Ashwagandha, giloy all confer varying degree of immunity and may confer varying degrees of benefit to different people, depending on their individual constitution,” said Bhavna Prasher, an Ayurveda doctor and scientist at the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.

Coronavirus | Patanjali to sell Coronil as 'immunity booster,' not 'cure for COVID-19'

In the modern-science view, there are two kinds of immunity: one is ‘innate’ immunity which is the first line of defence against an infection. A class of cells called “natural killer cells” and produced in the bone marrow directly attack infectious microbes. The other, a so-called adaptive immunity, where specialised cells produced in the thymus gland actively monitor — and produce antibodies that are specific to viruses and bacteria. Both systems work in tandem.

Coronavirus | COVID-19 has changed how Ayurveda centres administer treatments

Ayurvedic literature, said Prasher, suggests that several of the herbs have been tested in immune disorders and there is evidence to show that many of them have ‘immunomodulatory’ properties, meaning they are able to either amplify or suppress immune system responses.

“They are good at keeping the body or moving it towards a state of homeostasis — a state of internal stability that allows the body to keep itself in a state of health. However, Ayurveda is not only about these formulations and depending on the degree of sickness, there are other interventions. These are popular because they aren’t harmful and generally protective.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/qhamj4/article32887557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ayurvedajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-ayurveda-supplements-see-sales-boost-despite-thin-research-evidence-on-efficacy/article32886185.ece

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday welcomed Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s remark that Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari could have chosen his words better while writing to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on reopening places of worship in the State.

Talking to a TV channel, Mr Raut also said that with Shah’s statement, the Shiv Sena has put the issue to rest.

Mr Koshyari recently wrote to Mr Thackeray on reopening places of worship in the State and asked if the Shiv Sena president had “suddenly turned secular,” triggering a war of words between the governor and the chief minister.

Mr Shah on Saturday told a news channel that “Koshyari could have chosen his words better”.

Reacting to it, Mr Raut said Mr Shah is the country’s Home Minister and speaks with responsibility and caution.

The Raj Bhavan and the office of governor is a constitutional institution and falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs, he said.

“The governor’s letter followed by the chief minister’s reply was an unavoidable controversy and we haven’t started it. But, we are satisfied with the Union Home Minister’s stand and thank him for understanding the reason of our anger,” said Mr Raut.

Mr Raut dismissed speculation that Mr Shah was being soft on the Shiv Sena, a year after it snapped its ties with the BJP.

“There is nothing political. What Shah spoke was in line with the Constitution of India,” he said.

On Shah’s comments that the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death should have been handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) earlier, Raut asked, “Why should that have been done when the Mumbai Police are capable of probing it?”

“Before the investigation was completed, the case went to the CBI. What has the CBI found? Truth will come out,” the Shiv Sena leader said.

Mr Raut also said he agreed with Mr Shah’s observation that drugs and Bollywood should not be seen together.

94,2020/10/18,"Coronavirus | Onam led to Kerala COVID-19 spike, says Harsh Vardhan","State paid the price for gross negligence; others must learn from mistake, says Union Health Minister.

Kerala is seeing a spurt in cases due to “gross negligence” during Onam celebrations, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan during his weekly online interaction, Sunday Samvaad.

In response to a question on how had Kerala, once portrayed as a “model state” for keeping the virus in check, has now posted over 8,000 cases and what could other States learn, Mr. Vardhan replied, “Movement of people due to trade and tourism led to cases increasing beyond the two districts of Kasargod and Kannur. The epidemic curve of Kerala changed completely due to Onam festivities across the State during August and September. During August 22-Sept 2 (Onam week) there were huge congregations where people convened in large numbers and didn't take precautions. Kerala paid the price for its gross negligence after good control in the initial part of the pandemic. Other States must learn a lesson due to Kerala's negligence during Onam and States need to be careful during the coming festival season.”

Though there was a surge in cases since September, data shows that the State's “second wave”, one which hasn't yet seen a peak, had begun in early May. The second wave was attributable to the return of migrant workers from other States and returnees from abroad. Nearly 10.61 lakh people had entered the State through various routes, since the pandemic began of which half entered via flights alone.

Until June, 90% of cases were imported and by July this had reversed to 90% of cases being locally transmitted.

The share of cases from Kerala in India's overall load jumped from 2.9% until September 15 to 6.4% in the second half of the month to about 10% as of this month. Kerala also didn't increase testing to keep up with the population surge and also slackened on its contact tracing efforts that had helped it to contain significant spread until May. There were as of Sunday nearly 3.3 lakh cases in Kerala of which 96,000 are active infections, the Minister said.

Responding to another question on the market being flooded with oximeters made in China, Mr. Vardhan observed that “consumers should look for FDA/CE approved products with ISO/ IEC specifications.” However, he pointed out that a dip in oxygen saturation level was not always a COVID-19 symptom, and it could happen due to other underlying medical conditions as well.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a5rx4v/article32886001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HarshVardhan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-union-health-minister-harsh-vardhans-sunday-samvaad-on-october-18-2020/article32886002.ece

A naval version of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile was successfully test-fired from an indigenously built stealth destroyer of the Indian Navy in the Arabian Sea on Sunday, officials said.

The missile was fired from INS Chennai, a stealth destroyer, and it hit the target with pin-point accuracy after performing “extremely complex” manoeuvres, they said.

“BrahMos as ‘prime strike weapon’ will ensure the warship’s invincibility by engaging naval surface targets at long ranges, thus making the destroyer another lethal platform of Indian Navy,” the defence ministry said in a statement.

BrahMos Aerospace, an India-Russia joint venture, produces the supersonic cruise missile that can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or from land platforms.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the BrahMos Aerospace and the Indian Navy for the “successful” test-firing of the missile.

DRDO Chairman G. Satheesh Reddy too congratulated the scientists and all personnel involved in the test-firing of the missile which he said will add to the capabilities of the Indian Armed Forces in many ways.

In the last few weeks, India has test fired a number of missiles including a new version of the surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile BrahMos and anti-radiation missile Rudram-1.

India also carried out successful test firing of a laser guided anti-tank guided missile and nuclear capable hypersonic missile ‘Shaurya’.

The successful test firing of Rudram-1 was seen as a major milestone as it is India’s first indigenously developed anti-radiation weapon.

The flight testing of the missiles came in the midst of India’s bitter border row with China in eastern Ladakh.

In May last year, the Indian Air Force successfully test fired the aerial version of the BrahMos missile from a Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft.

On September 30, India successfully test fired a new version of the surface-to-surface version of the BrahMos.

The range of the new land attack version of the missile has been extended to 400 km from the original 290 km.

India has already deployed a sizeable number of the original BrahMos missiles and other key assets in several strategic locations along the de-facto border with China in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dw636s/article32885894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRAHMOS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-successfully-test-fires-naval-version-of-brahmos-missile/article32885895.ece

“Because of the winter season, some increase in pollution in north India as well as festival season, we have to be very careful... coming months are a challenge. One would be worried that we could lose the gains that we have made,” Paul said.

He also cautioned against any complacency about the decline in the number of new cases and called for keeping up the efforts to contain the pandemic.

“If we don’t take precaution, if we are not careful, because we are susceptible there can be escalation. God forbid, but we can avoid it.

To a query about storage and distribution of vaccine once it is available, he said India has enough cold storage facilities to an extent and this can be readily augmented as required.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over a news report that a BJP MLA in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri allegedly barged into police station to free a person booked on charges of harassing a woman.

Taking to twitter, Mr. Gandhi used an ongoing twitter trend to attack the BJP.

“How it started: Save Girl child. How it’s going: Save criminals,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted, tagging a news report that Lakhimpur Kheri’s MLA Lokendra Bahadur barged into a police station with his supporters to free a person, alleged to have harassed a woman.

Referring to the same incident, Ms. Vadra said, “Will the UP Chief Minister tell under which mission is it taking place? Save the girl child or save the criminals?”

Ms. Vadra, the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, also referred to the shooting incident in Ballia earlier this week in which a local BJP MLA defended the accused who had shot dead a person in the presence of police and local government officials after a fight over the allotment of a ration shop in the area.

Tagging the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J.P. Nadda, she asked if they stood with the MLA who was backing a criminal.

“@narendramodi, @JPNadda, @AmitShah do you back the MLA who is standing with the criminal. If not, why is he still in the BJP?” Ms. Vadra said, referring to the Balia incident.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cc5ebd/article32885398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKPTI03-10-2020000065B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rahul-priyanka-target-bjp-over-report-of-partys-up-mla-barging-into-police-station-to-free-eve-teaser/article32885399.ece

100,2020/10/18,"Secularism cannot be protected unless there is strict separation of religion from politics, says Yechury","CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said forces like the RSS want to “take India into the darkness of the past”

Unless there is a strict separation of religion from politics and government, secularism cannot be protected, defended or put into operation in a proper sense, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Saturday.

Mr. Yechury said forces like the RSS want to “take India into the darkness of the past” by changing the country’s history, culture, education policy “to give a monolithic Hindu identity to India” instead of its syncretic cultural identity.

Mr. Yechury was speaking while inaugurating the State-wide celebrations of the CPI(M) marking the 100th year of the founding of the Communist Party in India,through video conference.

October 17 of this year is a historic day for the communist party as it marks the hundred years of the formation of the first unit of the Communist Party of India in Tashkent in the then Soviet Union.

'Govt. does not have any religion'

“Secularism means the separation of religion from politics and from the state. Every individual has the right to choose his own faith and it will be the duty of the state, law to protect that right which is inviolable and the communists will always stand up to protect it,” Mr. Yechury said.

He said the state or the government does not have any religion and all the rights of individuals to their religion, or faith of their choice to their religious practices, need to be protected.

“However, secularism in our constitution was interpreted as equality of all religions. The moment you say equality of all religions, it’s only natural that the religion to which the majority of the population subscribe to, has a greater advantage over the others. And that has inherent dangers, which is what we are witnessing today.And unless there is a strict separation of religion from politics and government, secularism cannot be protected, defended or put into operation in a proper sense,” the CPI(M) general secretary said.

He said the entire logic of saying “my God is better than your God” is the basis for communal polarisation and communal conflicts.

“Today we have forces like the RSS, whose political wing is the BJP, who want to take India into darkness and backwardness of the past. Lack of scientific temper, rewriting Indian history, changing India’s education policy, changing India’s cultural policy in the cultural institutions, all to give a monolithic Hindu identity to India instead of the syncretic identity with which all of us grew up,” Mr. Yechury said.

He appealed to the people to join in the “battle to stop India from going into the darkness of its past” and to take India to the brightness of the future by ending exploitation and moving towards socialism.

Kerala CM's message

Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in a Facebook post, said that the communist parties are the “voice of democracy and civil rights” which are being suppressed by “fascist forces.”

“Looking back over a century of the party’s history is a proud experience for anyone who keeps in mind the dream of an egalitarian and peaceful social system.The communist movement survived brutal attacks and repression. It is a movement of brave martyrs who fought for their lives. An alternative political policy in favor of the people is the most important factor that makes the Communist Party relevant in the Indian context,” Mr. Vijayan said.

'Counter pseudo-nationalism with inclusive nationalism'

The CPI(M) in Kerala organised flaghoisting at each branchlevel adhering to COVID-19 protocol.

The CPI(M) in a statement said the congruent development of neo-liberalism and the Hindutva forces have posed a serious challenge for the Communist movement and all the Left and democratic forces.

“Neoliberal capitalism has brought many changes in the structure and composition of classes, some of which have had an adverse effect on the development of the working class and peasant movements.Rampant privatisation in all spheres has had its impact on the intermediate classes,” CPI(M) said.

It said there was a change with the assumption of power by the Modi government in 2014 and for the first time, a party based on “Hindutva ideology and controlled by the fascistic RSS has been wielding State power for the past six years.”

“The disastrous consequences for secularism, democracy and the well-being of the working people have been unfolding. A political force which had no role in the freedom struggle nor sharing its anti-imperialist secular ethos is now engaged in subverting the Constitution and instituting authoritarian rule all in the name of a nationalism which is regressive and reactionary,” the Left party said.

It said the challenge is to counter this pseudo-nationalism with an anti-imperialist, secular and inclusive nationalism and claimed the Communists are best equipped to do so because they carry forward the legacy of the anti-imperialist struggle for independence.

It also said that building unity of all Communist and left forces is crucial at this juncture to rally other democratic and secular forces.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9bzd0u/article32699910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THYECHURY-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/secularism-cannot-be-protected-unless-there-is-strict-separation-of-religion-from-politics-says-yechury/article32885045.ece
101,2020/10/18,The Hindu Explains | What can CJI Bobde do about charges levelled against judges by the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister?,"How are allegations of misconduct against judges dealt with? How will the CM’s complaint be handled?

The story so far: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has stirred a hornet’s nest by writing to the Chief Justice of India complaining about Supreme Court judge Justice N.V. Ramana for allegedly influencing posting of cases in the State High Court and alleging that some High Court judges are hostile to his government and are deliberately striking down his regime’s decisions and orders. In effect, he has accused many judges of misconduct, corruption and political bias. Such an open conflict between the judiciary and a Chief Minister is without precedent. Questions arise about what can be done about this serious complaint.

How are allegations of misconduct against judges dealt with?

The Constitution protects the independence of judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court by making them removable only through a long process of impeachment. However, not all forms of misconduct will warrant impeachment. There could be other kinds of impropriety too. There are times when serious complaints of this sort are received, and the Chief Justice of India (CJI) is called upon to examine them. Since 1997, judges have adopted an ‘in-house procedure’ for inquiring into such charges.

Also read | Judges are becoming victims of juicy gossip and slanderous social media posts, says Justice N.V. Ramana

When was the procedure adopted?

After Justice J.S. Verma took over as Chief Justice of India (CJI) in 1997, he circulated among judges a document called ‘Restatement of Values of Judicial life’. This was a set of principles containing the essential elements of ideal behaviour for judges. The Full Court passed a resolution that an ‘in-house procedure’ would be adopted for action against judges for acts of commission or omission that go against these values. A five-judge committee was constituted to come up with a procedure. Its report was adopted on December 15, 1999. It was made public in 2014.

How does the in-house procedure work?

When a complaint is received against a High Court judge, the CJI should decide if it is considered frivolous or if it is “directly related to the merits of a substantive decision in a judicial matter”, or it does not involve any serious misconduct or impropriety. If it is serious, the CJI should get the judge’s response. He may close the matter if he is satisfied with the response. If a deeper probe is considered necessary, both the complaint and the judge’s response, along with the Chief Justice’s comments, are recorded for further action. The same procedure holds good if the CJI receives a complaint directly. After considering the High Court’s Chief Justice, the judge involved and the complaint, the CJI, if deemed necessary, forms a three-member committee. The committee should have two Chief Justices from other High Courts and one High Court judge. The inquiry it holds is of the nature of a fact-finding mission and is not a formal judicial inquiry involving examination of witnesses. The judge concerned is entitled to appear before it.

If the case is against a High Court’s Chief Justice, the same procedure is followed, but the probe committee comprises a Supreme Court judge and two Chief Justices.

Editorial | Unpleasant spectacle

If a Supreme Court judge faces such a charge, the in-house panel will comprise three Supreme Court judges. The in-house procedure does not give any separate provision to deal with complaints against the Chief Justice of India. But in practice, a panel of three other Supreme Court justices is formed.

What happens after the probe is done?

If the committee finds substance in the charges, it can give two kinds of recommendations. One, that the misconduct is serious enough to require removal from office, or that it is not serious enough to warrant removal.

Comment | A constitutional pickle of the Andhra kind

In the former case, the judge concerned will be urged to resign or seek voluntary retirement. If the judge is unwilling to quit, the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned would be asked to withdraw judicial work from him. The President and the Prime Minister will be informed of the situation. This is expected to clear the way for Parliament to begin the process of impeachment. If the misconduct does not warrant removal, the judge would be advised accordingly.

How will the CM’s complaint be handled?

The complaint by the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister will have to be examined by the CJI from the perspective of whether it can be rejected as baseless, or it requires a deeper investigation.

Also read | Advocates slam Jagan Mohan Reddy’s letter to CJI

In details annexed to his letter, Mr. Reddy has cited several writ petitions in which adverse orders were passed against his regime. He also accuses the judges concerned of political bias not only against himself, but also in favour of his rival, N. Chandrababu Naidu, the former Chief Minister. Therefore, a key question would be: do the charges pertain merely to the merits of judicial orders, or are they serious enough to warrant a probe?",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6yjh4z/article32883893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-hindu-explains-what-can-cji-bobde-do-about-charges-levelled-against-judges-by-the-andhra-pradesh-chief-minister/article32883894.ece

With the inflows at the Prakasam Barrage rising gradually after a brief downward trend, a second flood warning was issued in the early hours of Sunday.

The second flood warning, which had been in force since October 14, was withdrawn only on Saturday afternoon as the discharge at the barrage fell to less than 5.69 lakh cusecs.

The discharge as of 7 p.m. was 6.15 lakh cusecs. It was 5.70 lakh cusecs at 6.30 a.m. As of 6 p.m., the discharge at the Srisailam project was 5.09 lakh cusecs. It was 5.23 lakh cusecs at Pulichintala.

The inflows and outflows at the barrage was more than 6 lakh cusecs throughout the day. A similar situation was likely to continue for another day, officials said.

104,2020/10/18,‘It’s up to the CJI to take a decision on CM’s letter’,"The issue merits a serious look at higher levels of judiciary, say BBA members

A few members of the Bezawada Bar Association (BBA) and the YSRCP Legal Cell have observed that the Chief Minister’s letter to the Chief Justice of India (CJI), accusing Justice N.V. Ramana, a judge of the Supreme Court, of influencing justice delivery in the Andhra Pradesh High Court should not be treated as a personal matter.

“An inquiry into it is a must for the sake of transparency and accountability in the system. It’s up to the CJI to take a decision,” they said while addressing the media here on Sunday.

“Some lawyers’ associations and Bar councils in the country are commenting on the issue when the matter merits a serious look at higher levels of judiciary,” said BBA member B. Raghava Rao.

“Advocates’ associations should take care of the lawyers’ welfare and desist from meddling with the functioning of the system to be in the good books of a few officers,” said O. Gavaskar, another advocate. He also took objection to a few members of the BBA finding fault with the Chief Minister writing a letter to the CJI.

Gag order on media

“The gag order issued by the High Court restraining the media from covering any news on the FIR filed by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) against a former Advocate-General in the alleged land scam in Amaravati and the order staying further probe into the case are nothing but taking the system into one’s hands,” said Ch. Sai Ram, a member of the BBA.

105,2020/10/18,SBI official held in ₹1.05 crore fake gold loan fraud in East Godavari,"A cash in-charge at the State Bank of India’s branch at Samanasa under Amalapuram rural police station in East Godavari district was arrested on Sunday for reportedly stealing gold from the bank to raise gold loan to the tune of ₹1.05 crore against the same gold.

The accused, identified as Bulusu Veera Venkata Satya Subramanya Sarma, 59, reportedly resorted to the fraud between February 2019 and September 2020.

Speaking at a press conference, Amalapuram DSP Masoon Basha said; “Mr. Sarma created 25 gold loan accounts on the name of his family members, relatives and some employees of his own SBI branch. The modus operandi was to steal the gold from the lockers during the settlement of the gold loans to the genuine customers and raise the loan against the same gold stolen by him.”

Mr. Sarma had managed to raise the gold loan to the tune of ₹1.05 crore in the name of his family members, relative and his staff.

“The accused has resorted to the fraud reportedly to clear off his personal debt of ₹55 lakh which he lost in the agriculture in recent years and was arrested on Sunday at one of his aqua ponds. Cases under the Sections of IPC 420, 409, 465, 471 and 477 (A) have been booked and investigation is on,” said the DSP.

Bala Tripura is the first goddess in the Tripura Traya and she is the main goddess of all in the Sri Yantra. Without having got the mantra of Bala, one is not eligible to perform the Sri Yantra pooja.

In the first amnaya of Sri Chakra, Bala resides, so without worshiping Bala one cannot perform pooja. Worshiping Bala Tripura Sundari is a vital part in the shakti pooja. Even listening to her name is considered to be beneficial to the sadhaka.

The temple priests on Sunday offered special pujas to the deity. 'Bala' means child. On this day, girls between 2 and 10 years are treated as manifestation of the goddess and are offered new clothes and gifts. The goddess is draped in red, green and yellow saris on this day and a naivedyam of payasam (rice kheer) and gaarelu is offered.

At least 18,000 teachers serving in the government schools have undergone the COVID-19 tests, before joining duty, as schools are reopening on November 2, in East Godavari district.

East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy has made it mandatory for every teacher in the government school to undergo the COVID-19 test in order to be allowed to attend the school, apart from implementing the SMS (Sanitization, Mask Use and Social Distance) initiative in the schools.

District Education Officer S. Abraham told The Hindu, ""90 % of the 18,000 teachers of the government schools in the East Godavari district have already undergone the COVID-19 test and the rest will take the test by November 2"".

In the case of private schools, guidelines are being prepared to ensure that every teacher should undergo the COVID-19 test. Nearly 10,000 teachers are in service in the private schools in the district.

""By November 2, we will ensure that all the teachers are tested for the COVID-19 both in the government and private schools. The district administration cannot afford to reopen the schools without every teacher being tested for the COVID-19, to prevent further spread of the disease from the teacher to the students"", said Mr. Abraham.

The district authorities are yet to decide whether the schools would be reopened with half of the student strength or with limited classes per day.

109,2020/10/18,Havelock Bridge likely to be handed over to Andhra Pradesh soon,"Order may be issued after Railway Board meeting this month, says MP

The South-Central Railway, Secunderabad, has decided in principle to hand over the 120-year-old decommissioned bridge across the Godavari and 1085.59 sq. yards of land adjacent to it in Rajamahendravaram to Andhra Pradesh in exchange of 2583.33 sq. yards of land offered by the State government.

The Railway Board is likely to issue the sanction order during its meeting scheduled to be held this month, Rajamahendravaram MP M. Bharat has told The Hindu after a meeting with Railway Board Chairman V.K. Yadav.

The 2.74-km length bridge, named after the then Governor of Madras, Sri Arthur Elibank Havelock, was commissioned on November 11, 1897 and thrown open for traffic on August 30, 1900. It was decommissioned in 1997 after its service for over a century in the history of Indian Railways.

In January, 2017, the Railway Board accorded approval for handing over the bridge to the State government on ‘as is where is basis’ subject to the conditions that exchange of railway land in the vicinity of bridge with the land of equivalent value.

In July, East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy wrote to the Indian Railways stating that the district administration was ready to hand over 2,583.33 sq. yards of land (Survey No.317 in Rajamahendravaram city) to the railways and request it to expedite further action to take possession of the railway land (1085 sq. yards) adjacent to the bridge.

On October 12, Chief General Engineer A. Achuta Rao (works branch, South Central Railway, Secunderabad) requested Executive Director (land and amenities), Railway Board, to communicate the handover proposal of the bridge and the respective land to the State government.

Beautification plan

Countries are experiencing one of the greatest demographic disruptions in history. The rapid ageing of their populations and reduced birth rates will drive an unprecedented growth in the proportion of the population aged 60 years plus, observed UN affiliated International Institute on Ageing (INIA) Deputy Director Rosette Farrugia Bonello, here on Saturday.

She was delivering the keynote address on ‘The Impact of Demographic Change and COVID-19 on Older Persons’ organised by GITAM Deemed to be University School of Gandhian Studies. She observed that as people age, their need for both health and social care is likely to become increasingly diverse.

Governments around the world are beginning to experiment with new policies to address these challenges and hence become prepared and well-equipped to secure the needs of population shifts, she added.

While focussing on Asian countries, she mentioned that the population of senior citizens is increasing at a fast rate in India. She also shared instances about the way COVID-19 has impacted the life of senior citizens and their caregivers across the world.

She also shared some measures which can be taken to help the seniors adapt with the new normal and thus encourage them in living a dignified life.

113,2020/10/18,"Delay in breast cancer treatment can lead to higher mortality rate, says expert","‘Sedentary lifestyle, junk food and smoking are some of the causes’

The decision to delay the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer may have grave consequences for cancer mortality in the years to come, say oncologists. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a massive challenge for the treatment of breast cancer patients.

“A substantial increase in inquiries was witnessed since the lockdown. We are urging women to keep examining their breasts and to contact their doctors. The success depends on early diagnosis and treatment and delays could lead to higher mortality rate in the coming decade,” says Dr. B. Ravi Shankar, oncologist of Omega Hospital, Visakhapatnam.

Breast cancer, that is diagnosed early, is easier to treat and offers the best survival chances. Regular screening for breast cancer, including annual mammograms after the age of 40 and self-examination of breasts after the age of 30 is important for everyone.

Hospitals are doing everything possible to make them safe and accessible to everyone who needs them as delay in breast cancer screenings and treatment could lead to a higher mortality rate in the coming decade.

During this testing time of COVID-19, experts are offering phone and online video consultations, where they are going through the patient’s symptoms and deciding the future plan of action. If annual mammogram was delayed by the pandemic, one should call the doctor and reschedule it.

Breast cancer has become the commonest cancer in urban women in India and second most common in rural women. According to World Health Organisation, the numbers are expected to rise dramatically by 2030, due to increased urbanisation and changing lifestyles.

Sedentary lifestyle coupled with junk food and smoking are some of the causes of the rise. Besides, family history and genetics do play a role in determining a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer. Women are considered at high risk if they have a family history of breast cancer or are over the age of 50, says Dr. Ravi Shankar

Women should look for any changes in their breasts and discuss it with their doctor. They should examine the entire breast, including the nipple area, up to the armpits and the collarbone, he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/delay-in-breast-cancer-treatment-can-lead-to-higher-mortality-rate-says-expert/article32884019.ece

115,2020/10/18,APEPDCL uses drone to restore power in villages,"Supply was cut off due to heavy rains

The Eastern Power Distribution Company of A.P. Limited (APEPDCL) has employed a drone to restore power supply in villages of Tuni mandal in East Godavari district, which could not be reached easily as water in the Thandava was flowing dangerously due to recent heavy rains.

Power supply to NS Venkatanagaram village was completely cut off and the water was flowing strongly between Kolimeru and NS Venkatanagaram, with even expert swimmers expressing their inability to cross the river. APEPDCL officials then utilised a drone to send the power supply cables across the river and completed the task in quick time.

Villagers expressed their gratitude to officials and staff of APEPDCL for restoring the power supply in a short span of time. APEPDCL CMD S. Nagalakshmi appreciated the efforts of S.E. Suryaprakash, D.E. David, ADE Ch. Meenakethana Rao, AE Kameswara Sastry and others to restore power by utilising technology.

116,2020/10/18,Vizag girl designs sanitiser gloves that disinfect surfaces,"Father-daughter duo who made product awaiting patent

It has been a nightmare to step out of one’s home during the last six months in view of the pandemic threat. Those going out on duty or on errands, are all the time worried whether they had touched any surface, where the ‘invisible virus’ was lurking.

It was this thought that haunted Pasagada Hemanjani, who had completed her Intermediate, during the early days of the lockdown in March.

She thought of developing ‘auto sanitiser gloves’ which could disinfect objects and surfaces effortlessly. She shared her thoughts with her father, P.M.D. Prasad, an employee in the Signal and Telecom Department of Railways, and he chipped in with his expertise.

“The inner layer of the glove is made of plastic material and the outer one is made of micro nano absorbent and dispensing material,” says Ms. Hemanjani.

How it works

“All we have to do is to wear the gloves and pass the gloved hands on the surfaces, which need to be disinfected.

The liquid sanitiser in the nano material spreads on the surfaces and kills the virus and remains there for 30 minutes to one hour, thereby offering some protection to subsequent users. The plastic inner layer protects our palms and hands from the sanitiser, which harms our hands if used for long,” she elaborates.

“The gloves disinfect all surfaces like door knobs, handles, tables and chairs which we have to touch when we enter an office or any other place,” explains Mr. Prasad.

“They are useful for travellers, particularly train and air passengers. We have applied to the Intellectual Property Facilitation Centre of the NRDC in Vizag for granting of a patent for our product and they have acknowledged receipt of the same on Sept. 14,” he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/60sy8l/article32883978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13VJGLOVES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vizag-girl-designs-sanitiser-gloves-that-disinfect-surfaces/article32883979.ece

Road transportation has been cut off to many villages in the downstream and island villages of Krishna river due to heavy rains in the catchment areas for the last three days.

Water was flowing on the main road at Madvanigudem, Gurvayipalem and other villages near Kalidindi, as the canal was overflowing due to continuous downpour.

Many families were shifted to safer places from the island villages downstream of the Prakasam Barrage as the discharge was heavy on Saturday. Officials were supplying food, milk, drinking water to the people, who were accommodated in rehabilitation centres.

Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana has directed the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials to prepare a permanent plan to prevent inundation of low-lying areas in the district.

The Minister reviewed the flood situation with MLA Malladi Vishnu, Commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh and other officials at Command and Control Centre on Saturday.

Mr. Venkatesh explained that food was being provided to 5,000 people who were shifted to rehabilitation centres, and health camps were arranged at Indira Gandhi Municipal Corporation Stadium and at the Municipal School.

Flood continuing

The Minister asked the officials to search for permanent accommodation for 2,500 families staying on the river bund.

Krishna District Collector A.Md. Imtiaz said that second warning level had been withdrawn as the discharge from Prakasam Barrage was 5.42 lakh cusecs by Saturday afternoon.

“Flood is continuing to Krishna, but the release from the barrage is decreasing and water level is less than the danger levels. However, instructions have been given to all the officers to be alert and continue relief operations,” Mr. Imtiaz said.

Tata Steel has supplied 80% of the steel used for the Kanaka Durga flyover, the 2.6 km six-lane project, the longest in the State, that was inaugurated on Friday.

The company had provided 2,000 tonnes of low relaxation pre-stressed concrete (LRPC) strands and 10,000 tonnes of TMT (thermo-mechanically-treated bars).

121,2020/10/18,Tourist spots under Forest Department to reopen soon in AP,"Visitors unaware of curbs returning disappointed from Atapaka, Hamsaladeevi

Here is some good news for nature lovers: the tourist spots in Krishna, East and West Godavari districts that have remained closed for the last six months due to the COVID-induced lockdown will be opened soon.

The tourist places being guarded by the Forest Department will be open to public after the Dasara festival.

Meanwhile, some people who are visiting these sites on weekends unaware of the restrictions are returning disappointed. There were also instances of people getting into heated arguments with the forest personnel for not allowing them to visit lakes and beaches.

“We have come from Khammam district to visit Hamsaladeevi but the forest officials did not allow us to go there. Our appeals for permission as we have come from a long distance fell on deaf ears,” lamented a visitor K. Krishna Reddy.

A similar situation was seen at Atapaka on Krishna-West Godavari district borders, in Kolleru lake.

“Thousands of people from A.P. and the neighbouring States visit the Atapaka Bird Sanctuary to enjoy the boating and watch the pelicans and other birds in the lake. Already, the winged visitors reached the sanctuary,” said a visitor B. Vaishali of Narsapuram in West Godavari district.

However, the forest personnel said as the sea was rough and the lake was filled to the brim, visitors were not being allowed as a precautionary measure.

Eluru Divisional Forest Officer (DFO-Wild Life Management) C. Selvam said plans were afoot to reopen tourist places in the division.

123,2020/10/18,Kalaburagi floods: People start showing their anger against leaders and administration,"They feel response has been delayed.

“Why did you come to our village? For giving poses to TV cameras or for listening to the sufferings of flood-hit farmers? You should listen to the affected farmers to get to know about the situation on the ground instead of simply relying on official data.”

This is how a farmer, who had taken shelter in a relief camp at Firozabad in Kalaburagi, took on Revenue Minister R. Ashok when the latter visited the flood-hit village last Friday. He was also equally agitated towards mediapersons, who encircled the Minister for taking his bytes, not allowing him to interact with the people in trouble. In the chaos, the farmer could not narrate his ordeal to the Minister as the leader rushed towards his car. The Minister made flying visits to a few villages in the district to complete the formality and left for the next district to repeat the process.

In another incident on the same day, villagers at Honagunta attempted to attack a government official who visited the flood-hit village. The Kagina floodwaters had inundated over 500 houses in the village and destroyed essential commodities such as foodgrains. The villagers did not have even drinking water to quench their thirst. The officer who visited the village the next morning somehow managed to escape the angry mob and sent a drinking water tanker within an hour.

Muttaga village, on the banks of the Kagina, went incommunicado for two days after all physical and telecommunication connectivity was cut off. The villagers had to spend nights on rooftops as their houses were inundated and power supply was disrupted. “We survived eating biscuits and drinking floodwater. Nobody came to our help,” a woman said.

When a team of Indian Army rushed to Udachana village in Afzalpur taluk in the early hours of Sunday to rescue the stranded people, the residents refused to be evicted as a token of protest against the government. Their complaint was that the government had not made any alternative arrangements permanently even after their village was flooded and houses damaged repeatedly.

When Lok Sabha member from Kalaburagi Umesh Jadhav visited Muttaga village, people welcomed him with slogans such as “go back, Jadhav”. The angry mob even gheraoed him and sent him back.

Mounting frustration

These are just a few of examples of how the public anger is accumulating against the political class and the administrative machinery that, many think, have failed to discharge their duties. Right from the start of the floods, the political class, especially the ruling party, appeared to be more interested in the Legislative Council polls to four seats and the byelections to two Assembly constituencies rather than in addressing the people’s woes. The main effort appeared to be in reaching out to the voters in trouble along with Bhima and Kagina. RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa did come to Kalaburagi, not for visiting flood-hit areas, but for accompanying Council poll candidate Shashil Namoshi as he filed his nomination papers.

Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, who is also in charge of Kalaburagi, has not paid a single visit to the flood-hit district. It was only after Congress leaders B.R. Patil and Sharan Prakash Patil criticised him that he clarified that he was home-quarantined after testing positive for COVID-19. He, however, did make a trip to Sira to accompany his party candidate when he filed his bypoll nomination papers.

The district administration appears to have woken up to the call a little too late. For the first time after decades, the district has been witnessing incessant downpour this year.

124,2020/10/18,Colleges likely to open on Nov. 2 in a phased manner,"Many of them have started asking students to submit consent letters if they wish to attend lectures

Colleges and universities across Karnataka are likely to commence classes in a phased manner from November 2. The Department of Higher Education earlier this month met Vice-Chancellors of different universities to work out the modalities.

Sources in the Higher Education Department said that they are also considering reopening colleges to conduct classes for students who wanted to clarify their doubts regarding online examinations.

‘Can’t force students’

“However, classes will be conducted on a voluntary basis. No college or university can force students to attend physical classes. We want to chalk out the modalities so that it is in the best interest of students’ health and academics,” the source said.

Many colleges have already started asking students to submit consent letters if they wish to attend classes from November 2 onwards.

However, not everyone is on board with the resumption of lectures. Echoing the views of some of his colleagues, a Vice-Chancellor of a State-run university said he was not in favour of this decision. “We just completed our final year examinations and will need another month to announce results and complete admissions to PG courses. Moreover, we are worried that COVID-19 cases may increase if we reopen colleges. We do not think it is a good idea to start classes till next year,” the V-C said.

A senior official from another university was of the opinion that the odd semester examinations which are conducted in December should be postponed.

“They can be held later next year once the number of COVID-19 cases reduces,” said the official.

Students oppose

Students and student organisations, too, have opposed the plan. “cases have not reduced completely and the State government should not make any decision in haste. A majority of students use public transport to commute to college, and they will be at risk,” said Amaresh Kadagada, State president, Students’ Federation of India.

In Karnataka, online classes commenced on September 1. Initially, the State government was planning to resume on-site lectures from October 1, but put it off owing to a spike in COVID-19 cases.

He was speaking at a consultation meet over the survey, organised by Karnataka Rajya Hindulida Vargagala Okkoota.

The meeting was attended by several OBC leaders cutting across party lines including Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah and seers from OBC communities.

“Mr. Siddaramaiah conducted the socio-economic survey but somehow did not implement it. There were several hurdles put for accepting the report in the coalition government. Now Mr. Siddaramaiah has said he will take to the streets if the report is not accepted. Our government will not give room for such protests, as we will accept the report. There will be opposition to the report from various quarters. Let us work towards its implementation across party lines,” he said.

A delegation of seers and leaders have now decided to meet Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to demand that the report be accepted and implemented immediately.

They will also demand that the Karnataka Permanent Backward Classes Commission be immediately reconstituted as it has been headless for over a year now.

Meanwhile, Mr. Siddaramaiah clarified that the survey report was not ready during his tenure and, if it was, he would have accepted and implemented its recommendations then only.

The 2020 Dasara festival that got under way in the city in a subdued manner under the cloud of COVID-19 on Saturday marks the continuation of a tradition whose origins are traced to the practices followed by the rulers of Vijayanagar empire.

There are references to the “great feast” in the writings of the medieval travellers such as Domingo Paes from Portugal who visited Vijayanagar around 1520-22 CE, and Fernao Nuniz who was in Vijayanagar sometime in the 1530s. Both left behind eyewitness accounts of the festival among other things they observed in Vijayanagar.

Their observations are also reinforced by the archaeological ruins described as Mahanavami Dibba at Hampi and from where it is reckoned that the kings would watch the procession go by.

Referring to the “great feast of nine days”, Domingo Paes refers to a structure as the House of Victory which historians equate with the Mahanavami Dibba. There, according to the medieval writer, used to be dais on which the king would rest and watch the feast preceded by worshipping an idol in a shrine.

Paes mentions that alongside the Vijayanagar king, prominent rulers owing allegiance to the former also used to take their seats. Interestingly, it is mentioned by Paes that among those who used to sit with the Vijayanagar ruler was the ‘king of Syrimgapatao’ (for Srirangapatana) and described him as “most prominent”. After the fall of the Vijayanagar the Wadiyars – who ruled from Srirangapatana – carried forward the Dasara tradition and it was Raja Wadiyar who on ascending the throne in 1610 CE, proclaimed that Dasara be celebrated on a grand scale.

It reached its climax during the later Wadiyars and one of the largest murals depicting the grandeur of Dasara was completed in the late 19th century and adorns the walls of the Jaganmohan Palace.

This painting itself is a throwback to an earlier period where the king has been depicted seated on a chariot drawn by elephants. The concept of the king being seated in a howdah mounted on an elephant was a later introduction.

Captured in paintings

The grandeur of Mysuru Dasara attained its zenith during the regime of Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar (1902-1940 CE) and is best captured in the paintings rendered by palace artists including Y. Subramanya Raju, S.N. Swamy, K.K eshaviah, S.R. Iyengar, Shankararaju and Y. Nagaraju.

The abolition of the privy purse in 1970 and its Parliament approval in 1971 saw a disruption in the proceedings and the last Maharaja, Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, conducted it privately. A few years later, his son Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar revived the practice of continuing the age-old tradition inherited from the Vijayanagar period while the State government decided to revive public Dasara and began sponsoring it from 1975.

A festival that is the fulcrum of tourism in modern times and unfolds over 10 days to a sea of humanity, is ironically being held under severe restrictions this year to prevent large gatherings and minimise the possibility of the spread of the pandemic.

Though the celebrations have been scaled down, the tradition has not been given the go by.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/nsdtly/article32885549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DASARAMYSORE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/when-medieval-travellers-watched-the-great-feast/article32887613.ece
127,2020/10/18,University of Mysore: A tale of two convocations amidst the pandemic,"In 1918, it was held when the region was grappling with another pandemic

A peek into the archival materials brings to fore certain similarities in the circumstances surrounding the 1st and the 100th convocation of the University of Mysore, to be held on Monday.

When the first convocation was held on October 19, 1918, the region was grappling with another pandemic (Influenza) and fighting severe drought. The 100th convocation is being held under the cloud of the COVID-19 pandemic and floods in parts of the State.

The then maharaja and the chancellor Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar was present in person at the first convocation of the university in which educationist Sir Ashuthosh Mukherjee delivered the convocation address.

But Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make a virtual address to mark the 100th convocation of the varsity and will not be present in person partly due to the situation arising out of the pandemic.

Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, in his speech during the convocation, referred to influenza which was then declared as an epidemic and had claimed thousands of lives. Expressing his sorrow over the outbreak of the disease, he had remarked that influenza had raised the mortality to alarming levels and appealed to the public to fight the scourge with courage.

According to Mysore Gazetteer edited by Hayavadhana Rao and published many years later, influenza hit Mysore State in 1918 and left 1.95 lakh people dead.

The Prime Minister’s address on Monday is also expected to touch upon the impact of the COVID-19 and the way forward and the challenges facing the economy and the country due to the pandemic.

Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar referred to the failure of monsoon in many parts of the kingdom and the prolonged drought and remarked that it had raised the cost of the necessities of life along with war conditions. But he held out assurance to the gathering that no effort or expenditure would be spared and his thoughts were constantly with the people. The situation is similar in the present times and apart from the pandemic, the State is grappling with flood.

His speech was not unduly lengthy and there were references to the growth of the university and the increase in the cost of higher education. As a testimony to his understanding of the education system, he noted that the schools are the feeders to the university and efforts were being made to improve their standards.

In the present times, there are concerted efforts to reduce drop out rates in schools and increase the gross enrolment ratio in higher educational institutions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ntx5ep/article32887602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGNALWADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-tale-of-two-convocations-amidst-the-pandemic/article32887603.ece
128,2020/10/18,Nehru’s address at UoM convocation in 1948 remains untraceable,"He had spoken at the special convocation in Crawford Hall

The virtual address scheduled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of University of Mysore’s 100th convocation on Monday brings under focus the address delivered by India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru at special convocation of the university held on December 28, 1948.

According to records available with the university, Nehru addressed the special convocation at the Crawford Hall, where an honorary degree of Doctor of Science was conferred on him by the then “Maharaja of Mysore” Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, the Chancellor.

“It was Nehru’s first doctorate,” according to a coffee table book “One Hundred Years University of Mysore 1916-2016” brought out on the occasion of the university’s centenary celebrations. But, Nehru’s address on the occasion is untraceable in records of the university.

Visiting Professor, Kuvempu Institute of Kannada Studies, University of Mysore, C. Naganna, who retired as Director of Prasaranga, the publication directorate of the University, told The Hindu that the Prasaranga has brought out two volumes of the university’s convocation addresses. But, Mr. Nehru’s address has remained conspicuous by its absence.

The university, founded in 1916, had its first convocation on October 19, 1918, which was addressed by Ashuthosh Mukherjee. The first volume contains addresses delivered during various convocations starting from the first one in 1918 to 1995, though a few addresses are missing due to non-availability of information.

“The convocations addresses delivered after the one by Rajadharmapravina Diwan Bahadur K.S. Chandrasekara Iyer in 1944 till the one delivered by Syama Prasad Mukherjee in 1949 are missing,” Prof. Naganna said. The second volume of convocation addresses has been updated till the 2014 convocation address.

N. Niranjan Nikam, who was one of the editorial advisers for the coffee table book, said the university could not hold its annual convocation during 1947, the year in which India attained Independence, and the degrees were conferred to the students in absentia.

But during 1948, two convocations were held. While one was the regular convocation held on October 25, 1948, addressed by the then Dewan of Mysore Sir M. Visveswaraya, and the second one was the special convocation held on December 28, 1948, to confer the honorary doctorate to the then Prime Minister.

Prof. Naganna said the doctorate given to Mr. Nehru was the first-ever doctorate given to the late former Prime Minister from any university. No serious attempts had been made so far to secure Mr. Nehru’s address on the occasion.

“It is very unfortunate,” he said before adding that efforts will be made to trace the address in other archives of Mr. Nehru.

“We will try to trace the address and update it in the next volume of the convocation addresses,” Prof. Naganna added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/y9letw/article32887598.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGNEHRU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nehrus-address-at-uom-convocation-in-1948-remains-untraceable/article32887599.ece
129,2020/10/18,Webinar,"Belagavi NCC Group organised a webinar on “Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Saptah IV” at GSS College here from October 12-17.

Colonel JJ Abraham, Group Commander, NCC Group, Belagavi, inaugurated it. He asked cadets to make use of this opportunity to learn about the rich and diverse heritage of other States. Principal N.D. Hegde spoke.

Cadets from Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana participated in the webinar. They exchanged their knowledge of history, geography, economy, culture, food, language, cuisine, festivals and tourism with each other. They also interacted with the cadets of other States.

The programme aims at enhancing interaction and promoting mutual understanding between people of different States through the concept of State pairing.

130,2020/10/18,Flight from Mysuru to Mangaluru soon,"Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, will introduce regular flights from Mysuru to Mangaluru in a move that will enhance the region’s connectivity to coastal Karnataka.

The flight was tentatively scheduled to commence from October 25 but Mysuru Airport Director R. Manjunath said that the date of commencement will be confirmed in a day or two as there were certain issues to be ironed out.

“But the timings have been fixed and the flight will arrive at Mysuru at 8.50 a.m. and depart for Mangaluru at 9.30 a.m. The scheduled timing is ideal as people flying into Mysuru or Mangaluru will have the entire day for them on reaching their respective destinations,” he added.

There was tremendous demand for direct flight connectivity from Mysuru to Mangaluru since many years as Mysuru has a sizeable population of people from the coastal region. The road travel was not only cumbersome but would take an entire night making it tedious. Travelling during monsoon used to be fraught with uncertainty due to heavy rains that lash along the route, especially when passing through Kodagu district.

Mr. Manjunath said he expects the flights to operate at full capacity as the number of people and stakeholders from both tourism and industrial sector who evinced interest in the route was high.

The flight will be operated under the Centre’s UDAN scheme, and once launched Mangaluru would be the seventh destination to have air connectivity from Mysuru. The other cities already linked to Mysuru by air include Kochi, Goa, Chennai, Bengaluru, Belagavi and Hyderabad.

Welcoming the development, Suresh Kumar Jain of Mysore Industries Association said the passenger load from Mysuru to Mangaluru was assured as there were a large number of hoteliers, industrialists and people in the service sector belonging to coastal region who had settled in Mysuru.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/szvivj/article32887583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGFLIGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/flight-from-mysuru-to-mangaluru-soon/article32887584.ece

134,2020/10/18,Dakshina Kannada teachers begin video lessons for I PU students too,"Having provided video lessons for II PU students across the State, lecturers from Dakshina Kannada have now taken the lead in providing similar lessons for I PU students too.

Video lessons for the I PU are made available under Swabhoda (self-learning) classes on YouTube. The Department of Pre-University has asked PU colleges across the State to make use of these lessons.

As per the supplementary chargesheet, Nagaraj, along with other police officials, had closed inquiries and verifications on complaints they had received from citizens against IMA.

136,2020/10/18,"HC refuses to discharge ex-MLA, his firm, partners from illegal ore export cases","They pertain to export of seized iron ore from Belekeri port

The High Court of Karnataka has rejected the plea of several accused persons, including a former MLA, a former deputy conservator of port, and directors of private companies, to discharge them from cases of illegal export of seized iron ore from Belekeri port in Karwar during 2009–10.

The court rejected the petitions of Shree Mallikarjun Shipping Pvt. Ltd. and its managing director Satish Krishna Sail, a former MLA for Karwar; Shri Lal Mahal Ltd. and its directors Prem Chand Garg and Sushil Kumar Valecha of New Delhi; and Mahesh J. Biliye, the then Deputy Conservator of Belekeri port (now retired).

Justice John Michael Cunha passed the order while upholding the orders passed by the Special Court for CBI cases during 2016–17. The Special Court had decided to frame charges against them while declining to discharge them from the cases, in which the Central Bureau of Investigation had filed chargesheets against them after conducting the probe, ordered by the Supreme Court.

The High Court has held that the Special Court had followed the procedure prescribed in law while dismissing their plea for discharge and deciding to frame charges against them.

Also, the High Court said that the Special Court had rightly decided to frame the charges of criminal conspiracy against Mr. Sail as there were other materials, which independently constitute ingredients of the offences, available against him apart from his role as managing director of the company.

“The Special Court has considered these allegations in extenso and having found that the material produced by the prosecution prima facie make out the ingredients of offences under sections 120-B read with Sections 409 and 420 of IPC against petitioner number-2 [Mr. Sail] has proceeded to frame charges for the above offences. I do not find any error or infirmity in the orders warranting interference,” Mr. Justice Cunha observed.

On the charges against the former deputy conservator port, the High Court said that the documents clearly reveal that Mr. Biliye himself had allowed export of seized ore under his seal and signature. Also, the High Court declined to accept his contention that he was totally unaware of the transaction and that he has been made a scapegoat by the forest officials to save themselves from the illegalities committed by them in effecting seizure of the ore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/n3jomo/article32823401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10KRAKARHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-refuses-to-discharge-ex-mla-his-firm-partners-from-illegal-ore-export-cases/article32884233.ece
137,2020/10/18,"In R.R. Nagar, Congress is reaching out to all sections to seek votes","The Karnataka Congress, led by D.K. Shivakumar, seems to be reaching out to all sections in Rajarajeshwarinagar constituency in Bengaluru for drumming up support to counter BJP’s Munirathna, one of the MLAs whose defection to the saffron party led to the collapse of the JD(S)–Congress coalition government last year.

Since the day of the filing nomination papers by the party candidate Kusuma H., Mr. Shivakumar has been visiting the houses of prominent people in the constituency and seeking their support.

Building network

Besides inducting nearly 300 ward-level leaders from other parties into the Congress in the last couple of days, Mr. Shivakumar has met Kannada actor Prem Kumar and his wife, and Karnataka Rakshana Vedike president Narayana Gowda at their residences.

Sources in the Congress said Mr. Shivakumar has been meeting families of prominent social workers, artistes, and influential people in the constituency for building a support base cutting across social cleavages to challenge the “money power” of Mr. Munirathna, the film producer-turned-politician and the richest man in the fray going by the assets declared.

Ms. Kusuma, wife of deceased IAS officer D.K. Ravi, who quit academics, is testing political waters for the first time, by facing Mr. Munirathna, who won the last two Assembly elections on a Congress ticket. The party has been projecting the clean image of Ms. Kusuma to garner votes of women and youth in the urban constituency, which has a good number of Vokkaliga votes.

Women, fans backing

The D.K. Ravi Abhimanigala Balaga, headed by N. Murali Gowda, too has pledged its support to Ms. Kusuma. Association members, who are expected to stay back in the constituency till the polling on November 3, have decided to focus the campaign by informing voters of the good work done by Ravi in Kolar and other districts when he was Deputy Commissioner.

The Mahila Congress,led by its president Pushpa Amarnath, held a protest against the BJP for a police case registered against “innocent” Ms. Kusuma for alleged violation of the model code of conduct while filing nominations.

On the other hand, Mr. Munirathna, who has banking on the support of the BJP government and Ministers, has been developing a narrative of “development works” executed by him in the constituency to get votes. JD(S) candidate is V. Krishnamurthy, also a débutante and a Vokkaliga like Ms. Kusuma.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jqutyz/article32884216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGPROTESTKUSUMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/in-rr-nagar-congress-is-reaching-out-to-all-sections-to-seek-votes/article32884217.ece
138,2020/10/18,Bypolls: Health officials in a quandary as people flout COVID-19 protocol,"They are under pressure to implement control measures but are finding it hard to stop crowding

With a little over two weeks left for the bypolls, health officials in the election-bound constituencies of R.R. Nagar in Bengaluru Urban and Sira in Tumakuru district are in a quandary. While there is pressure on them to ensure strict COVID-19 control measures, they are finding it hard to stop crowding during nomination filing and roadshows, which are going on as it was during pre-COVID-19 times.

As per the Election Commission’s guidelines, although not more than 200 people can gather in closed spaces and not more than 15 persons per gunta in open spaces, no political party is following this. While social distancing is not being maintained, even masks are not being worn properly, officials said.

A senior official from Tumakuru district said there was pressure on the district health administration from higher officials in the department to ensure strict containment and control measures. This, especially because the number of days taken to double COVID-19 cases in this district is 33 — way below the State average of 39 days. Also, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) here is 1.7%, which is higher than the State average of 1.2%. At 13.2%, the test positivity rate (TPR) here is also high.

“We have regular videoconferences where our higher officials pull us up for the rising cases. On an average, we have been seeing around 200 cases every day. In Sira, till Friday we have had around 200 active cases and 10 deaths so far. Now, with the election fever picking up, we are finding it hard to control the crowding. Even those under home quarantine are part of the crowds,” said the official.

The situation is no different in R.R. Nagar. This constituency that has one containment ward as of Friday contributes 11% of the total cases in Bengaluru Urban. On an average, over 330 cases are being reported from this zone daily in the last 10 days.

Bengaluru Urban DHO G. Srinivas said people are careless. “Although public meetings are yet to start here, crowds in the roadshows indicate that people are least bothered. They are ready to pay a fine for not wearing a mask rather than safeguarding themselves,” he said.

Set an example

COVID-19 experts said political leaders should set an example for appropriate behaviour.

“It is very difficult to do away with campaigning in elections. However, it is essential for political leaders to not only follow COVID-19-appropriate behaviour but also set an example as role models for such behaviour. The candidates will have to ensure that they refuse to address/meet people in closed spaces, do not contribute to crowds, and reduce the close-contact settings,” said Giridhara R. Babu, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee.

He said they should set an example by wearing masks all the time during campaigning.

“Areas where bypolls are being held are currently witnessing a surge in cases and hence the candidates must ensure that they protect the vulnerable in these areas. As part of their election campaign, candidates can showcase how their leadership will help promote testing in their constituency, ensure timely referral, and save lives. It is time to demonstrate by actions, not words, as speaking aloud may spread the virus,” he asserted.

Three notices

Deputy Chief Minister and Kalaburagi district in-charge Minister Govind M. Karjol has directed officials to accelerate the pace of work and immediately extend all assistance to flood victims, those who lost their homes, and farmers whose crops were destroyed in floods due to torrential rain.

As thousands of houses lie flattened and hundreds of families have become homeless in the past one week following heavy rainfall, Mr. Karjol on Saturday instructed the district authorities to conduct a damage assessment survey of houses destroyed in floods in each village through the Panchayat Development Officer and the village accountant and to provide immediate shelter to flood victims and the homeless poor living in huts. He also ordered an increase in the number of relief care centres, if needed.

Apart from house damage, directions have been given to the district authorities to conduct surveys to assess the damage caused to crops, roads, and other infrastructure. Mr. Karjol asked Kalaburagi Deputy Commissioner V.V. Jyothsna to update him with minute-by-minute details of the relief works and to submit a comprehensive report on the relief works taken up in the district.

141,2020/10/18,25 COVID-19 patients with fracture treated at KIMS,"During the lockdown and unlock period, the surgeons of the Department of Orthopaedics of Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) and hospital successfully treated 546 orthopaedic patients, including 25 who had tested positive for COVID-19.

Addressing presspersons prior to a World Trauma Day programme at KIMS here on Saturday, institute director Ramalingappa Antarathani and head of the Department of Orthopaedics Suryakant K. said that all precautions were taken while operating on the COVID-19 patients who required surgery for fractures and other orthopaedic problems. They have recovered now and have also been cured of COVID-19, the doctors said.

Dr. Ramalingappa said that during the pandemic, the number of patients visiting the hospital for orthopaedic problems went down by 50%. While the lack of public transport was one reason, the other was that accidents had automatically come down because of the ban on vehicular movement, he said.

However, lack of transport facilities also delayed the visit of several patients to the hospital, resulting in further complications in some cases. “Our team of doctors and paramedical staff from the Department of Orthopaedics has successfully handled the situation and operated on those in need,” he said.

Dr. Suryakant also said that many of the patients who were operated on for orthopaedic problems had recovered completely, and some came back for consultation and further medical advice. “From March to August this year, a total of 546 patients underwent surgery. Several of these patients underwent complicated surgeries,” he said.

He said that despite the COVID-19 fear, innovative procedures were used with ample precautions while treating the 25 COVID-19 patients with orthopaedic issues.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/25-covid-19-patients-with-fracture-treated-at-kims/article32883900.ece

Leading them was Assistant Commissioner of Police Anusha G., who spoke to street vendors, buyers, and particularly those who had come from villages to sell farm produce in the city but were not wearing masks. She explained to them why it was necessary to follow the COVID-19 guidelines.

The police personnel distributed face masks to the vendors, motorcyclists, and the general public, asking them to wear face masks compulsorily. They warned them about the penalty that would be imposed if they were found violating COVID-19 guidelines, and also appealed to them to maintain social distancing.

Chairing an emergency meeting with officials in Yadgir on Saturday, Ms. Ragapriya said that officials of the department concerned at Sonna bridge had informed that they had already released 2.7 lakh cusecs of water into the river, with an increase in quantum to 8 lakh cusecs now possible.

“If they release 8 lakh cusecs of water, 12 villages in the district which are in a 500- metre radius of Bhima river will be affected by floods, and another 33 villages will be disconnected from the outside world. Therefore, officials should take immediate steps to shift the residents and animals at safer planes and also distribute foodgrains to the residents of 33 villages by taking elected representatives into confidence,"" she said.

Ms. Ragapriya also said that 14 Kalaji Kendras have already been established and provided the basic needs for the people shifted there.

144,2020/10/18,High mortality in young heart-attack patients,"SCTIMST study reports 30% mortality within 10 years, 48% within 20 years in persons aged below 30

A study of the clinical profile and angiographic treatment patterns of patients less than 30 years of age who had presented with acute myocardial infarction or heart attack at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) between 1978 and 2017 has reported 30% mortality within 10 years and a whopping 48% in 20 years.

The high mortality rate in this small group of young coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, which is much higher than the mortality rate among older patients, is a matter of grave concern.

The study appears in the latest issue of the Indian Journal of Medical Research.

Modifiable risk factors

“This is a very important group of patients whose disease is eminently preventable through the modification of risk factors. One important factor which contributed to the high mortality in this age group was late presentation at the hospital, with 38% patients arriving at the hospital after the window period for primary interventions such as thrombolysis or angioplasty. This delay in seeking medical care led to their poor outcome. More awareness should be created in the community of the possibility of cardiac events occurring in the young age group also and that medical attention should not be delayed,” S. Harikrishnan, Professor of Cardiology, SCTIMST, said.

271 patients

During the 40-year period between 1978-2017, 271 patients less than 30 years of age reached the department of Cardiology at the SCTIMST with a diagnosis of CAD. Of these, 159 patients underwent coronary angiography and constituted the study group.

Data from the young patients with CAD remain scarce, particularly regarding their long-term outcomes.

Potentially modifiable major cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high blood cholesterol, alcohol use or obesity) were associated with 95% of patients with symptomatic CAD. Only seven patients (4.4%) did not have any of the risk factors.

Habits continued

A total of 82% of these patients presented at the hospital with acute myocardial infarction. On follow up, it was found that 34% of patients continued to smoke even after their first cardiac event while 17% continued their alcohol habits at long term follow up.

More than half of the patients remained physically inactive, and 79% had inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables at long-term follow up. Importantly, 41% of patients discontinued their prescribed medications for the reason that they did not experience any symptoms. The implications of non-adherence in the young population could be catastrophic, researchers said. Latest follow-up data were available in 92% patients. Forty-one patients died during follow up.

Among those who were alive on follow up, 16 recurrent acute coronary events were documented in 14 patients, 18 patients (12%) developed heart failure on follow up, 16 of whom expired.

‘Don’t ignore symptoms’

“The study results point to the need for heightened efforts for preventive strategies in the community. There needs to be more awareness in the community of the possibility of CAD in this very young age group. The important message is that chest pain or atypical symptoms of CAD in youngsters should not be ignored as early medical intervention can give much better outcomes,” Arun Gopalakrishnan, Assistant Professor of Cardiology, SCTIMST.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mt2mbq/article32887882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tv-Cardiologycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/high-mortality-in-young-heart-attack-patients/article32887883.ece

The process to acquire land for the reconstruction of the District Court Bridge in Alappuzha has been set in motion, with the government publishing a preliminary notification in the Gazette.

Officials said that the copy of the notification issued by District Collector A. Alexander had been made available at district collectorate, RDO office among others.

The public could raise objections regarding the updation of land records or the title in respect of the land proposed for acquisition before the Special Tahsildar (LA unit II), KIIFB, Alappuzha.

According to the notification, 0.4556 hectares of land in Mullakkal village under Ambalappuzha taluk will be acquired for the project.

The existing court bridge across the Vada canal has six roads merge at two approaches to it.

As a result, heavy traffic congestion affects the smooth flow of traffic on the Alappuzha-Madurai State Highway. The proposal is to build a new elevated bridge, a set of underpasses, ramp roads and flyovers on either side of the canal, which is expected to help ease traffic congestion in Alappuzha town.

Roundabout

As per the detailed project report prepared by the Public Work Department’s (PWD) bridges design unit, the flyover is designed as a roundabout with no signals.

The project will be implemented by the Kerala Road Fund Board at a cost of ₹98.9 crore.

Houseboats officially resumed services in the district on Sunday.

According to M. Malin, secretary, District Tourism Promotion Council, a total of 25 boats were operated from two houseboat terminals at Punnamada Finishing Point and Pallathuruthy.

“More than 100 tourists turned up for cruising in houseboats. It is a positive sign. We are expecting more visitors in the coming days,” he said.

Mr. Malin said that houseboat operations were conducted following COVID-19 protocols and guidelines issued.

Although houseboats officially only set sail on Sunday, a few vessels have been operating since October 12 when the government opened the tourism sector in the State.

Owners of the licensed houseboats have urged authorities to initiate stringent action against illegal boats and those operating flouting the COVID-19 protocols.

Officials said that a squad was formed to check COVID-19 protocol violations in the sector.

As part of the restrictions in place, check-ins and check-outs are allowed only at Finishing Point and Pallathuruthy houseboat terminals.

Tourists should register on COVID-19 Jagratha portal before checking into the houseboat.

147,2020/10/18,Sparse crowds at tourist spots in Palakkad,"Malampuzha garden, Kanhirapuzha and Pothundi parks see low inflow

Inflow of local tourists is yet to pick up at major destinations such as Malampuzha, Kanhirapuzha, and Nelliampathy in the district.

Malampuzha garden, one of the busiest tourist spots in the State, saw a sparse crowd on Sunday. The crowds at Kanhirapuzha and Pothundi parks too were thin.

Malampuzha used to witness the heaviest turnout of people on Sundays before it was closed down as part of the COVID-19 lockdown. A number of people from Tamil Nadu used to visit Malampuzha, which was rated as one of the hottest destinations for school picnics in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

Although the tourist spots reopened on Friday, there were several restrictions. At Malampuzha, the children’s park remained closed and people were allowed entry into the main park. Other areas, including the dam, remained closed for the public.

Phased reopening

Officials said the public would be given entry to other areas in a phased manner. Boating will be restarted after a few days, they said. Handwash and hand sanitising were made compulsory, and tourists were allowed inside after scanning them for temperature. There was a one-hour time limit for tourists inside the Malampuzha garden and they were advised against crowding.

Although Tipu’s Fort or Palakkad Fort was opened for the public a few weeks ago, it too has been witnessing a sparse turnout. Fort authorities have stopped issuing on-the-spot entry tickets. Visitors have largely been deterred by the online ticketing system launched by the Archaeological Survey of India that manages the fort.

The State on Sunday reported 7,631 new cases of COVID-19 when 58,404 samples were tested in the past 24 hours, taking the cumulative case burden to 3,41,859.

A high number of recoveries were reported on the same day, with 8,410 patients being discharged from hospitals. The test positivity rate remains fluctuating, moving from 17.3% to 13% on Sunday. However, sample testing, which had barely gone above 50,000, seems to have picked up on Sunday.

The total number of recoveries being 2,45,399, the number of patients currently in hospitals is 95,200. Of these active cases, 767 are critically ill and in ICUs, while 191 are on ventilator support.

With 22 new deaths reported, the toll has gone up to 1,161. Six of these were reported from Palakkad, four each from Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam, three from Malappuram, two each from Kozhikode and Thrissur and one from Alappuzha.

Almost 98% of the new cases – 7,471 cases – reported are locally acquired infections, which includes 723 cases with no epidemiological link. The number of health-care workers who contracted COVID-19 in this group is 63.

150,2020/10/18,"Kerala likely to get ₹9,006 crore as GST compensation","GST compensation till January 2021 as per Centre’s decision to borrow

Kerala is likely to get ₹9,006 crore as Goods and Service Tax (GST) compensation till January 2021 as per the Centre’s decision to borrow through a special window and provide back to back loans to States in lieu of the compensation.

Of the anticipated ₹9,006 crore, ₹5,767 crore will be from the Centre’s borrowing for States. The remaining ₹3,239 crore is from the projected GST cess this year by the Finance Department for April 2020-January 2021 period.

For the State, this will be a big relief as it can avoid the deduction of salary of government employees and teachers. The State needs ₹2,500 crore to pay salary every month. Mobilising resources to fight the spread of COVID-19 is another challenge.

The State, while welcoming the initiative of the Union Finance Minister, is putting pressure to borrow ₹1.70 lakh crore instead of the ₹1.1 lakh crore. The State is of the view that the total shortfall in the collection of GST estimated at ₹2.35 lakh crore should be provided this year itself.

However, the State has not officially announced that it has accepted the Centre’s offer. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac, in a tweet, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has put off the scheduled high-level meeting of officials of the Finance and Law Departments to discuss ways to approach Supreme Court on the GST.

“Having amicably settled the question of who should borrow, we hope Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will address the question of how much to borrow through dialogue with State Finance Ministers,” Dr. Isaac said in the tweet.

Kerala, which is looking forward to the GST compensation arrears from March 2020 to overcome the financial crisis, had not benefited from the compensation of ₹20,000 crore to States towards loss of revenue during 2020-21 and ₹25,000 crore towards Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) of 2017-18 announced after the 42nd GST Council meeting on October 5.

An amount of ₹915 crore had reached the treasury on October 5 night itself from the compensation towards loss of revenue.

The district once again registered a dip in the COVID-19 daily caseload with 685 new cases reported on Sunday. Four more recent deaths in the district were confirmed as due to the infection.

As many as 523 persons who have newly tested positive contracted the virus through local transmission. In 143 cases, the source was not known, according to health officials. While 13 persons were in home quarantine, two had arrived from abroad.

The deceased included a 62-year-old man from Nalanchira; an 82-year-old woman from Pallithura; a 63-year-old woman from Anayara; and a woman hailing from Thiruvananthapuram city. Meanwhile, there appears to be no abatement in the spread of infection among people in the vulnerable age groups and health workers.

Seventy-seven more children below the age of 15 and 135 persons above the age of 60 have tested positive, according to Health officials. Of the 63 health workers who were diagnosed with the disease Statewide on Sunday, 15 belonged to Thiruvananthapuram district. The number of daily cases in the district has remained under the 1000-mark for over a week now, but Health officials warn that the lower numbers do not offer an excuse to lower the guard. After reporting relatively low figures throughout the week, the daily caseload had risen to 848 on Saturday.

Sunday’s caseload included 351 women and 334 men. With four more deaths attributed to the infection, the death toll has touched 345. On the bright side, 1,210 persons have recovered from the disease.

As on Sunday, 10,364 persons are under treatment for COVID-19 in Thiruvananthapuram district. In all, 2,905 persons were newly quarantined on Sunday, taking the total number under surveillance to 30,758.

153,2020/10/18,Top UDF leaders tried to ensnare Mani,"Private agency report on bar bribery comes out in public domain

As the controversy set off by Jose K. Mani over the alleged back-stabbing of his father and Kerala Congress (M) founder leader K.M. Mani by the Congress continued to rage, a report accusing some United Democratic Front (UDF) leaders of hatching a conspiracy to ensnare the KC(M) patriarch in the bar bribery scam has now emerged in the public domain.

The report, purportedly based on an investigation carried out by a private agency, named Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, Adoor Prakash and Joseph Vazhakkan as the key conspirators. Kerala Congress (B) leader R. Balakrishna Pillai and Kerala Janapaksham leader P.C. George, MLA, too were accused of being part of the conspiracy, which was reportedly hatched at a Government Guest House at Mundakkayam, Kottayam.

Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy too has been accused of being aware of the conspiracy.

According to it, a conspiracy was allegedly hatched to frame the late KC(M) leader as he had stood in the way of Mr. Chennithala's attempt to replace Mr. Chandy as the Chief Minister.

About six years ago, the KC(M) had appointed an intra-party commission led by the late C.F. Thomas to probe the alleged conspiracy. The findings of the commission, which was submitted in March 2016, are yet to be made public.

The Mani group, meanwhile, responded that the report that came out on Sunday was not the official investigation report in possession of the party leadership. “We have not yet decided on releasing the investigation report officially. In fact, this is not the first time that the media are reporting about such an investigation report, which does not have anything to do with the official report,” Mr. Mani said.

Official sources, however, held that some findings of the `leaked report' were close to the ones reported by the intra-party commission.

Meanwhile, the Mani group, which has been shaken by attrition of workers at the grassroots received a major boost with the former Poonjar MLA V.J. Joseph, former Meenachil panchayat president C.V. John and others joining its ranks here on Sunday. They were handed party membership at a function organised by the Mani group in Pala.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/top-udf-leaders-tried-to-ensnare-mani/article32886820.ece

The trial in the actor rape case, which was put on hold after the prosecution seeking time to move the Kerala High court for a change of court, may resume on Tuesday.

On Monday, the Special Court trying the case has scheduled to take up two petitions, one moved by actor Dileep, the 8th accused in the case, seeking action against media houses who allegedly published the proceedings of the in-camera trial and another one on the social media statements of some of the members of Women Collective in Cinema (WCC). A few members of the WCC had made social media statements against some actors, whom the WCC members claimed to have turned hostile during the trial.

Incidentally, A. Sureshan, the Special Public Prosecutor in the case, had moved the petition apprehending that the victims would not get “fair trial and justice” from the court.

He had submitted that the court was “highly biased, which is detrimental to the judicial system and to the entire prosecution.” He also apprehended that justice will be denied to the victim in the case if the case was tried before the present court.

The prosecution case is that the accused kidnapped the actor and raped her in a moving car. Actor Dileep has been accused of conspiring with the other accused in the case.

The Registry of the Kerala High Court has not interfered in the issue as it has not officially received the petition. On its part, the State government had not issued any directive to its prosecution wing in the Kerala High Court to move the petition for change of court, legal sources said.

Weighing the legal options in the case, judicial sources indicated that the prosecution may have to move the judicial side of the Kerala High Court if it was keen on a change of court, as raised in its petition.

At the same time, the trial court will have to be restart the proceedings in the case as scheduled earlier unless the prosecution formally informed the court that it had moved the High Court for changing the court. The trial court cannot afford to idle its time away as the Supreme Court had set a deadline for completing the trial, sources said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/trial-in-actor-rape-case-to-resume-this-week/article32886785.ece
155,2020/10/18,Water level in Idukki reservoir on the rise,"It was 2,393.86 ft., 3 ft short of orange-alert level, on Sunday morning

Despite a lull in rainfall and increased power generation at the Moolamattom power house, the water level at Idukki reservoir continued to rise, though slowly, on Sunday. The water level at 10 a.m. was 2,393.86 ft., nearly 3 ft short of the orange alert level, as per the new rule curve fixed by the Central Water Commission. The orange alert level is 2,396.85 ft and the red alert level is 2,397.85 ft.

Even if the shutters of the Idukki dam were opened and water released, there would be no flooding, said the officials of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). “The water level of the Periyar and Pampa rivers are at a low this year. The allowed level in the Periyar river is 9 m and the present water-flowing level is below 1 m. The allowed level in the Pampa is 6 m and the present water-flowing level is 1.6 m,” said an official of the KSEB (Transmission, System Operation).

Power generation

The power generation has been raised to 9.504 mu at the Moolamattom power plant. The marketing wing collected bids and sold the extra power generated, said an official.

Water storage in the hydel reservoirs in the State is nearly 90% of the total storage level.

In other dams

The storage level in main hydel dams is Idukki (89%), Pampa (89%), Sholayar (94%), Idamalayar (88%), Kundala (91%), Mattupetty (86%), Kuttiady (66%), Thariyode (92%), Anayirangal (78%), Ponmudi (91%), Neriyamangalam (94%), Peringalkuthu (77%), Lower Periyar (60%) and Kakkad (86%).",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/water-level-in-idukki-reservoir-on-the-rise/article32886743.ece
156,2020/10/18,SC stays HC verdict on new engg. courses,"KTU says courses sanctioned without proper study on the subjects

The Supreme Court has stayed the High Court verdict directing the A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU), Thiruvananthapuram, to consider the applications submitted by various self-financing engineering colleges seeking affiliation for starting additional undergraduate courses in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning and Block Chain.

The stay order came on a special leave petition filed by the KTU challenging the High Court judgment. The university in its petition said the action of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) in sanctioning new courses to the petitioner institutions without a study on the subjects and without consultations with the State government/university/board was in violation of the provisions of the AICTE Act.

The petition said the university decision was in line with the State government decision in this regard. The State government had decided to grant new courses in the existing engineering colleges only if they satisfy certain conditions. They are the new courses should have NBA accreditation, admission in the previous years should be more than 50% of the sanctioned intake and new courses proposed should be innovative.

These conditions are imposed in view of the fact that the demand for engineering undergraduate courses in private self-financing colleges has drastically come down in the last one decade. There had been an alarming decline in the intake in private self-financing engineering colleges during the academic year 2018-19 and 2019-20.

A study conducted by academic experts in the engineering field which was reported to the government said that the low rate of admission would make the institutions financially not viable and consequently compromise on faculty and infrastructure. It would lead to undermining the already depleted standards of education.

The study opined that indiscriminate sanctioning of courses in institutions which were below standards was against the interest of society at large. In fact, the conditions for starting new additional courses was applicable only to institutions which did not have NBA accreditation. The decision had been communicated to the AICTE.

The petitioner colleges could aspire for new courses only after getting NBA accreditation for the existing courses, the petition added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6yjh4z/article32883893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sc-stays-hc-verdict-on-new-engg-courses/article32886735.ece
157,2020/10/18,Machine man at MCH to help with COVID control,"CET students develop a small robot to guide people at the hospitla’s Orthopaedics wing

Visitors to the Orthopaedics wing at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) here are likely to come across a small robot that would be gliding across the reception area, giving out instructions on the protocols to be followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Developed by a group of students from the College of Engineering Thiruvananthapuram, the CET-Covbot V1.0 can perform tasks such as automatic sanitizer dispensing, remote patient assistance, delivering food and medicines, collecting samples and specimens, in addition to announcement of COVID-19-related messages and warnings.

The mobile robot can be alternatively controlled using a joystick or it can be put on autonomous navigation mode. The robot has a user interface for remote user operation. Dynamic obstacle avoidance has also been integrated into the robot so that it would stop when it comes across obstacles, especially visitors in a hospital setting. It was developed by students of MTech Robotics & Automation (2018-20 Batch) under CET-Centre for Interdisciplinary Research (CCIR),

“We had made a prototype of a robot as part of our project earlier. A few months ago, doctors from the Medical College reached out to our institution, asking whether a robot to perform these tasks can be developed. When we showed our prototype, they wanted us to develop a practical model of it. Five of us worked together for two months to develop the robot in its current form,” says CET student Sanjuna Mariam Mathews, who led the team.

Ajmal M, Rojin Reji Philip, Harikrishnan. K, Arun Shankar. M are the other members of the team. The project was fully funded by Lighthouse, the alumni group of the CET 1987-91 batch. The robot is capable of carrying loads up to 40 kg and can efficiently perform transport and delivery of food and other necessary items. It is also equipped with a hand sanitiser dispenser as well as an interface for the patients to access telemedicine services.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/machine-man-at-mch-to-help-with-covid-control/article32886604.ece
158,2020/10/18,Major revamp on the cards at State textile corpn. unit in Kannur,"Facilities for bleaching, colouring, printing to be arranged

For many traditional handloom weaving cooperatives in the State, the woven fabric has to be transported to Tamil Nadu to get it dyed or printed. This has also been the case with the State government’s free handloom uniforms for students till class 7, which had to be transported to and back from the neighbouring State for dyeing purposes.

Now, a major revamp is about to begin at the State Textile Corporation’s facility at the Textile Park run by the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (KINFRA) in Nadukani in Kannur, after which all of this work can be done within the State, with consequent savings in costs and time.

“Not all of the processes required on the fabric could be done as the current facilities are inadequate. So, rather than doing it here, they used to transport it to Tamil Nadu. The facility has thus remained underutilised. The new processing unit will address all these issues, and bleaching, colouring and printing of yarns as well as clothes can be done here. In addition to uniforms, printing of bedsheets, sarees and curtains can be done. Already, all the supporting infrastructure, including an effluent treatment plant, RO plant and access to clean water, is available,” says N. Sasidharan Nair, Chairman, Public Sector Restructuring and Internal Audit Board (RIAB).

Modernisation

The revamping work on the entire facility is set to begin soon and is expected to be completed within 6 to 8 months. He says that the textile sector in the State is set for a major change with the modernisation of many spinning mills. The cooperative spinning mill in Kollam which was upgraded with new machinery will be opened soon. The Alappuzha Cooperative Spinning Mill has also had a major revamp, while similar work is ongoing at the cooperative mill in Thrissur.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/major-revamp-on-the-cards-at-state-textile-corpn-unit-in-kannur/article32886344.ece
159,2020/10/18,e-TAPP for fast-tracking JJM connections,"KWA officials can avoid circuitous procedures to achieve connection target of 21.42 lakh

Faced with a steep target for 2020-21 for providing rural water connections under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) has introduced a mobile-friendly web application for fast-tracking the procedures.

Developed by the IT wing of the KWA, the web app has been christened e-TAPP and is intended for the use of KWA officials. The procedures for all JJM-related water connections issued by the KWA will be carried out through e-TAPP. It will not be applicable for the connections given through Jalanidhi, which has also been entrusted with JJM projects in the State.

As the connection target for 2020-21 in the State was fixed at 21.42 lakh, it was decided to avoid circuitous procedures to ensure speedy disposal of applications.

Simplified procedure

Under the simplified procedure, the KWA requires only the Aadhaar number, mobile phone number, and the address of the applicant for providing the connection. The KWA has issued a user-ID and password for e-TAPP to all its assistant engineers and overseers.

For providing the connection, KWA officials will visit the applicant’s home and note down the relevant details and the GPS location using the app. Other details such as area code, meter number, and the first reading too are fed in and sent for the Assistant Engineer’s approval via the app. Once the approval is given, the new connection comes into being. A new consumer ID and number are created and are added to revenue collection software of the KWA.

Once the details are sent via SMS to the consumer, the procedure is completed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/e-tapp-for-fast-tracking-jjm-connections/article32886238.ece
160,2020/10/18,COVID-19 shrinks Kerala GST collection more than 37% in March-August,"The pandemic-induced lockdown hit all the 66 sectors classified under goods and 27 sectors under services

As COVID-19 continues its seemingly unstoppable march across the globe, Kerala economy has taken a massive knock on the face as GST collection slid 37.4% overall with the goods segment accounting for a fall of 37.5% and the services segment accounting for a fall of 36.8% between March and August 2020 when compared to the same period last year.

The overall GST collection fell from ₹10,079 crore during March-August 2019 to ₹6,307 crore 2020, said a study under the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation by Anand Singh, State GST commissioner and associate professor N. Ramalingam.

Kerala was already reeling under two years of devastating floods in 2018 and 2019 and, prior to that, the 2016 November demonetisation and now the lockdown imposed on all spheres of activity to contain COVID-19. GST growth in the State was a nominal 0.17% between 2018-19 and 2019-20.

The pandemic-induced lockdown hit all the 66 sectors classified under goods and 27 sectors under services. Goods account for 82% of the GST and services 18%, the study said.

Fifty per cent of the GST under the goods head comes from building materials, automobiles and electrical and electronics goods while tax from the services sector is dominated by finance, construction and telecom.

The GST fall in the goods segment is from ₹8,157.7 crore to ₹5,094.2 crore while under the services segment the fall is from ₹1,922 crore to ₹1,213 crore.

All segments saw the slide with building material seeing a GST revenue fall of nearly 37%; automobiles more than 51%; electrical and electronic goods nearly 31%; medicines and medical products nearly 18%; lottery, which is classified under the goods head, more that 41%; provisions and grocery items 17%; jewellery more than 40% and textiles nearly 70%. GST from petroleum products fell 35% and FMCGs fell more than 18% and footwear more than 66%.

Under the services segment, GST from construction fell sharply at more than 44% while support services segment account for a fall of nearly 59%.

Entertainment and sports industry

The lockdown which forced people indoors was more prominently reflected on the entertainment and sports industry, where GST fell nearly 84%. Goods and passenger transport, accommodation and food, telecom and data services also showed varying levels of GST fall.

The study also said that the overall expected GST collection for the period under consideration was ₹7,456 crore, a fall of 26%, when considering the completion of all GST filings for the months.

Under the goods segment the deficit could then fall to 26.1% (actual collection ₹6,021.4 crore) and in the services segment it would fall to 25.3% (actual collection ₹1,434 crore).",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ijhb03/article32499023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-GST1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-shrinks-kerala-gst-collection-more-than-37-in-march-august/article32885494.ece
161,2020/10/18,"Coronavirus | Despite a drop in tests, fresh cases in Kerala edge past 9,000","From peak of over 70,000 samples, State now tests 50,000-plus; Karnataka incidence above 7,000; Telangana, A.P. stay flat

Kerala reported 9,016 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday from 52,067 samples.

The test positivity rate stood at 17.31%, higher than the 14.05% of the previous day. After testing 73,816 samples on October 7, the highest number, subsequent days showed testing drop to 38,259 samples on October 12. Samples tested in a daybarely went above 50,000, since then. The sudden drop in testing has been attributed to technical glitches in the new Lab Diagnosis and Management System.

The total samples tested in a day, as given out by the Health department, does not specify daily tests carried out daily to detect new cases. Since the total samples includes repeat samples and antigen tests done prior to discharging patients (on average, 7,500-8,000 a day), actual samples tested to detect new infections daily were described as likely lower than the claimed figure.

The Health department added 26 more deaths from the past days to the death list on Saturday. Thiruvananthapuram reported seven deaths. There were four at Malappuram, three each at Kollam, Kottayam and Thrissur two each at Kozhikode and Alapuzha and one each at Ernakulam and Kannur.

Malappuram’s cases continued to climb at 1,519. Thrissur had 1,109, Ernakulam 1,022, Kozhikode 926, Thiruvananthapuram 848, Palakkad 688, Kollam 656, Alapuzha 629, Kannur 464, Kottayam 411, Kasaragod 280, Pathanamthitta 203, Idukki 140 and Wayanad 121 cases.

Karnataka on Saturday reported 7,184 new cases and 71 more deaths. Bengaluru Urban district reported 3,371 cases. With 14 of 71 deaths from Bengaluru, the toll rose to 3,500. The State carried out 1,01,016 tests including 24,174 rapid antigen tests on Saturday.

Andhra Pradesh reported less than four thousand new infections. It recorded 3,676 new infections and 24 fresh deaths on Saturday.

At 5.19%, the positivity rate of 70,881 samples was the lowest in over three months. The overall positivity rate dropped to 11.14%. East Godavari’s daily new cases dropped but it continued to report the highest tallies. Chittoor had the highest number of new deaths.

Telangana’s incidence stood at 1,451 on Friday and nine more COVID-19 patients died. On October 16, a total of 42,497 people were tested for the virus. The new cases included 235 from Greater Hyderabad.

162,2020/10/18,Pandemic crisis hits ginger farmers hard,"Wayanad market sees drastic fall in spot prices of the commodity

With only a few weeks left for ginger harvest, uncertainties in the market triggered by the pandemic have cast a pall over thousands of farmers who have cultivated the crop in Wayanad and parts of Karnataka.

The abrupt closure of major ginger markets in the country coupled with a sharp fall in prices of ginger rhizomes and low production owing to crop diseases are major concerns of farmers.

The spot price of ginger in the Wayanad market on Saturday was ₹950 to ₹1,000 a bag (60 kg) as against ₹2,900 a bag during the corresponding period last year. The price went up to ₹8,000 in August last year, said Navrang Mohanan, general secretary, All India Ginger Growers Association.

K.P. Sandeep, a farmer from Sulthan Bathery, said he had invested nearly ₹5 lakh on the crop on one acre of leased land but was compelled to take premature harvest owing to a fungal disease that affected the crop after heavy rain a few weeks ago. “I got only 20 bags of ginger after the harvest,” he said, adding that he had no clue about compensating for the loss. Many a time, traders refused to purchase the produce owing to uncertainties in the market, he said.

“Nobody can predict when the authorities will declare containment zones in major markets of the country. Hence, we are not in a position to procure the produce in huge quantities. Moreover, we cannot stock the perishable stuff for a long time,” said Jis Thomas, a ginger dealer in Hassan of Karnataka.

The area under ginger cultivation had increased nearly threefold this season owing to good prices in the past two years. An average yield of ginger rhizomes from an acre is 18 to 20 tonnes, but it declined to 10 to 12 tonnes this season, as many farmers started cultivation two months later this year owing to the pandemic, Mr. Mohanan said.

Around 25,000 farmers in the State had cultivated the crop on nearly 1,50,000 hectares of leased land in Karnataka alone this year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9l19qg/article32884362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvwyginger,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pandemic-crisis-hits-ginger-farmers-hard/article32884363.ece

165,2020/10/18,COVID-19 is additional layer to ‘gender equality in education’ challenge: UNESCO report,"The report said while the extent of implications is difficult to predict with precision, they need to be monitored closely.

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an education crisis, fuelled by deep and multiple forms of inequality having gender roots and implications, the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) report by UNESCO has pointed out. Increase in gender-based violence during the period families spent at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, potential rise in teenage pregnancies or early marriages, possibility of a section of girls dropping out of schools or colleges, girls being at a disadvantage due to shift to online learning and increased responsibilities of household chores, are among the several implications pointed out by UNESCO in the report.

“Uncertainty over the contagiousness and deadliness of COVID-19 led governments around the world to impose lockdowns, curtail economic activity and close schools and universities. In April, 91 % of the global student population was affected in 194 countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an education crisis, fuelled by deep and multiple forms of inequality. Some of these forms have gender roots and gender implications,” it said.

Also Read | Data: Gender disparity in early education

The report said while the extent of implications is difficult to predict with precision, they need to be monitored closely.

“The first of these implications is concern that the extended period families spent at home during the lockdown increased gender-based violence. Whether such violence affects mothers or girls, the consequences for girls’ ability to continue learning are clear. Second, sexual and gender-based violence coupled with restricted access to reproductive health, police, justice and social support services may increase early pregnancy,” it added.

The UNSECO report has raised a red flag about the potential increase in early pregnancy likely to be a result of increased early marriages, a consequence of households being plunged deeper into poverty due to the pandemic.

“One estimate is that COVID-19 could cause 13 million more child marriages over the next 10 years. There have been attempts, based on previous knowledge of the links between poverty and school attendance, to project the potential effect of COVID-19 on dropout. UNESCO suggests that 3.5 % of adolescent girls of lower secondary school age and 4.1 % of young women of upper secondary school age in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk of not returning to school,” it said.

Quoting the World Bank that girls aged 12 to 17 are more at risk than boys of not returning to school in low and lower-middle-income countries, the report recommended that the countries need to recognise the need to maintain contact with girls during the pandemic to support their eventual return to schools.

“Fourth, the shift to online distance learning could disadvantage girls. In low and middle income countries, women are 8 % less likely than men to have a mobile phone and 20 % less likely to use the internet on it. Finally, school closures have led to increased child care and chore responsibilities at home, which are likely to disadvantage girls more.

“A study of secondary school students in Ecuador during lockdown showed boys and girls were equally likely to continue their education in the morning but more girls did chores in the afternoon, while boys were engaged in leisure activities,” it said.

COVID-19 has infected over 3.91 crore people across the globe claiming over 11 lakh lives.

According to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimates, over 154 crore students are severely impacted by closure of educational institutions across the world amid the COVID-19 outbreak.",,https://www.thehindu.com/education/47087y/article32886067.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GIRLSTUDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/education/covid-19-is-additional-layer-to-gender-equality-in-education-challenge-unesco-report/article32886068.ece

More than 4,000 fishermen from here returned without catch after some of them were allegedly driven away by Sri Lankan Navy personnel while fishing near Katchatheevu, fishermen association leaders said on Sunday.

The fishermen were fishing between Danushkodi and Katchatheevu, an islet ceded to Sri Lanka, past midnight on Saturday when gun-toting Sri Lankan Naval personnel came in patrol boats and drove away around 50 of the nearly 600 mechanised boats, they claimed.

The fishermen, who have not been venturing into sea in the past fortnight due to a strike and weather conditions, had put out to sea on Saturday night.

Fishermen association leader S Emrit claimed that the fisherfolk had to return without a catch after the Lanka navymen chased them away and that it resulted in monetary losses to them.

He urged the state and central governments to take up the issue with the island nation’s government so as to alleviate the woes of the Tamil Nadu fishermen.

168,2020/10/18,TN government yet to install MRI facility at all government hospitals: RTI Act reply,"Only 11 of the 46 government headquarters hospitals in the State have been provided with MRI facilities over the last three years, the reply to an activist revealed

In January 2017, the Madras High Court (Madurai Bench) had, on a writ petition filed by an activist J. Anand Raj, directed the State government to establish MRI facilities across all government headquarters hospitals.

However, the activist recently obtained information through the Right To Information (RTI) Act from the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) Limited, which showed that the government was yet to implement the court directive fully.

Only 11 out of the 46 government headquarters hospitals in the State have been provided with MRI facilities over the last three years, for which the government had spent ₹56 crore.

The activist said that the information furnished by the TNMSC showed that patients, who had taken scans at the MRI and CT facilities, had paid ₹264 crore over the last nine years. All the GHs had collected charges ranging from ₹500 to ₹1,000 for CT scans and ₹2,500 to ₹3,500 each for MRIs. Only those patients, whose annual income was less than ₹72,000, were covered under the Chief Minister’s Health Insurance Scheme.

Mr. Anand Raj has since urged the government to provide MRI facilities at least in Usilampatti (Madurai district), Kovilpatti (Thoothukudi), Karaikudi (Sivaganga), Tenkasi (Tenkasi), Srivilliputtur (Virudhunagar), Periakulam (Theni) and Padmanabhapuram (Kanniyakumari district) hospitals before this fiscal year.

The doctors/radiologists in these hospitals said that due to the absence of MRI facilities, the patients had to travel at least 50 km to 100 km every time, for a scan. With the COVID-19 pandemic, when the government has been repeatedly telling people not to venture out, critical patients have had to travel long distances due to poor infrastructure, Mr. Anand Raj said.

According to him, though the CT scan facility was available at all the hospitals, it was not functioning 24x7 in many locations, forcing the patients to travel to other cities or to look for private scan centres. He suspected that the government was deliberately aiding private scan centres by not providing the facilities in government headquarters hospitals as directed by the court.

When The Hindu contacted a senior official at the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services, he acknowledged that there was a delay in installation of the equipment. However, he explained that the government cannot simply install the equipment and leave it there. “We have to recruit people for the facility, fix the pay scale, give training to them to handle the devices and so on. It will take time. Today, the priority for the government is to fight COVID-19. All the left-out GHs will get MRI facilities in the next 18 months,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-government-yet-to-install-mri-facility-at-all-government-hospitals-rti-act-reply/article32885775.ece
169,2020/10/18,Protecting pachyderm pathways,"A strong political will is needed secure the 16 elephant corridors in Tamil Nadu, including five inter-State ones to ensure connectivity between habitats. Enough research has been done. Now is the time for action

With the Supreme Court having delivered its landmark verdict upholding the 2011 Madras High Court order notifying the Sigur elephant corridor in The Nilgiris, the future of wildlife using the landscape, particularly elephants, is secure.

In its judgment, the court summarily rejected the contentions of the appellants, the owners of resorts operating in the area, that the State government has no statutory power for creation/recognition of new corridors. It did not find merit in the argument.

The court also did not find fault with the recommendations of the High Court-appointed Expert Committee, and rejected the second limb of the appellants’ submission challenging the scientific accuracy of the committee’s report claiming that the single corridor identified was at odds with scientific publications.

Illegal resorts

During the proceedings, the Supreme Court was informed that large-scale construction was under way in the Sigur corridor. It directed The Nilgiris Collector to prepare and present a plan of action. Collector J. Innocent Divya submitted that all 39 resorts were operating illegally as 27 of them had obtained approvals only for residential purposes and 12 had not obtained any approval at all. Based on the court’s directions, the resorts were sealed.

A total of 309 buildings in the 39 resorts, which are located within the 22-km-long and 1.5-km-wide elephant corridor.

“All the resorts and buildings in the Sigur corridor should be demolished soon in the wake of the Supreme Court order,” says A.J.T. Johnsingh, former dean of the Wildlife Institute of India. “If those buildings are not demolished, they will create further problems as they can turn hideouts for poachers and anti-social elements. Similarly, barbed wire fences and similar materials used for safety around the buildings should also be removed to make the area safe for the wildlife,” he notes.

Importance of corridors

The Supreme Court judgment explains: The elephants are a keystone species because their nomadic behaviour is immensely important to the environment. Herds of roaming elephants are landscape architects, facilitate seed dispersal, provide nutrition to plants and animals, are part of the forest food chain, and they have an umbrella effect.

Elephant corridors allow them to continue their nomadic mode of survival, despite shrinking forest cover, by facilitating travel between distinct forest habitats. The corridors are often narrow and linear patches that establish connectivity across habitats. Also, elephants are genetically programmed by nature to never inbreed within their birth family and thus need to move around between gene pools to reproduce.

In today’s world where habitat fragmentation has become increasingly common, these corridors play a crucial role in sustaining wildlife by reducing the impact of habitat isolation. In their absence, elephants would be unable to move freely. It would eventually lead to the local extinction of elephants, a species widely revered in India. To ensure wild elephants’ future, elephant corridors must be protected.

Significance of Sigur

According to Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), the Brahmagiri-Nilgiris-Eastern Ghats population has about 6,300-6,500 elephants, distributed over 12,000 sq km of habitat. A number of the Protected Areas, including Bandipur, Nagarahole, Mudumalai, Wayanad, Biligirirangan Swamy Temple, Kaveri and Brahmagiri, fall within the area. The diversity in vegetation, ranging from dry thorn forest to the montane shola grasslands, makes this one of the best elephant reserves in the country with a demographically and genetically viable population. This is the largest population of elephants in the country, and possibly in Asia as well.

The Sigur plateau connects the Western and Eastern Ghats. The WTI’s book, Right of Passage-Elephant Corridors of India published first in 2006 lists four corridors in the Sigur plateau. The Expert Committee, in its report to the Madras High Court, made them into one major corridor.

A long, legal battle

The battle to protect the corridor has continued since 1972, when noted conservationist, E.R.C. Davidar, who was then the secretary of the Nilgiri Wildlife and Environment Association (NWEA), began studying elephant corridors in Gudalur, Kallar and the Sigur plateau.

“Soon afterwards, the corridor became a source of intense study, with five elephants being radio-collared. Of the five, telemetric data from three gave researchers a general outline of the entire extent of the corridor,” says N. Mohanraj, a Nilgiris-based conservationist.

Conservationists say that protecting the corridor will also ensure contiguous habitats for other endangered species of wildlife that inhabit the Sigur plateau, including the Asian king vulture, white-rumped vulture, the striped hyena, tigers, black buck and four-horned antelope.

M. Santhanaraman, a lawyer who represented the Nilgiri Wildlife and Environment Association in the High Court in support of the establishment of the corridor, says, “The State and Central governments have been consistently in favour of declaring the corridor for the last 12 years. The verdict of the Supreme Court reinforces the faith of conservationists in the judiciary and proves yet again that the courts in India are custodians of forests and wildlife. In line with this judgment, a comprehensive legislation should be enacted to secure all the elephant corridors across the country.”

“While seven of the 88 corridors identified in 2005 were found impaired in 2017, we identified 20 new corridors taking the number of elephant corridors in the country to 101. Disturbances caused by human interventions in the existing corridors are forcing elephants to use alternative routes between two habitats, creating new corridors. If they use the alternative route for five years, then it can be considered a new corridor,” says K. Ramkumar, an elephant expert from Wildlife Trust of India and a member of Asian Elephant Specialist Group, IUCN Species Survival Commission.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/z5fc7k/article32885441.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18Elephant3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/protecting-pachyderm-pathways/article32885452.ece

M. Sakthivel of Guruvarajapet in Arakkonam taluk, Ranipet district, is elated now. He has scored 674 out of 720 in the NEET, cracking the exams with the help of social media and some books as his father could not afford fees for private coaching institutes.

Mr. Sakthivel is the younger son of J. Mani, a worker in a weaving unit, and Nagajothi, a tailor. His sister M. Suchitra and his brother M. Suresh have completed engineering. His parents educated them despite the hardships.

“Till Class X, I studied in a government school in my neighbourhood. As there was no proper maths teacher, I shifted to Vivekananda Vidyalaya Matriculation Higher Secondary School. I completed my Plus 2 in 2018-19 and scored 588 marks,” he said. After preparing for 45 days, he appeared for NEET but managed to score only 358.

Second attempt

“I knew I will not get a medical seat and my father cannot afford the admission fee in private colleges, so I decided to study hard and appear for the exams again,” Mr. Sakthivel said.

Though some people wanted him to join a private coaching institute, he refused considering the financial situation of the family.

173,2020/10/18,Police say doorstep enquiry system has been received well,"A total of 3,900 out of 7,800 petitions disposed of in the North Zone police limits

In a move to revive traditional policing and to prevent overcrowding in police stations during the pandemic, the North Zone police asked all police stations to hold petition enquiries in the petitioners’ homes or villages.

A total of 7,800 petitions were received in the north zone over the last fortnight and out of this 3,900 were disposed of after investigations on the doorsteps of the complainants. Vellore had the highest number of petitions.

There are a total of 299 police stations in North Zone police limits, including Ranipet, Tirupattur, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Cuddalore, Kallakurichi and Villupuram. In order to ensure petitions were disposed of at the earliest, J.K. Tripathy, DGP, and Rajesh Das, ADGP, Law and Order, introduced the system for doorstep enquiries from October 1.

In Vellore, a total of 1,830 petitions were received within the last fortnight and out of this 930 were attended to on the doorsteps of the complainant and were disposed of. In Tirupattur, around 200 petitions were received and 150 were disposed of. The number was 320 and 165 in Ranipet.

Earlier, those involved in the case will be summoned to the station for enquiry.

Now, a head constable will go to the village of the complainant for preliminary investigation and then the inspector or sub-inspector will follow suit for questioning.

“The biggest advantage in this system is that cases are disposed of quickly as petitioners do not have to travel to the station many times. Besides, middle men who often cause problems are eliminated as the personnel directly visit the petitioners. Allegations about harassment by the police will also not arise, and the entire process will be transparent,” a senior police officer said.

175,2020/10/18,NEET pass percentage goes up in T.N.,"Number of registered participants comes down; participants in Tamil also decline

Tamil Nadu, for the first time since the introduction of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), exceeded the nationwide pass percentage this year with 57.44% of participants clearing the examination. The national pass percentage was at 56.44%.

Among the major States, the biggest gain in pass percentage was by Gujarat that saw its pass percentage going up by 9.3 percentage points. Tamil Nadu gained 8.87 percentage points compared to its 48.57% pass percentage in 2019.

The State had the 15th highest pass percentage in the country. Ahead of Tamil Nadu were States like Rajasthan, Delhi, Kerala, Karnataka, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh.

Tamil Nadu was the only major State to gain a significant increase in pass percentage continuously in the past two years.

The number of registered participants for NEET from Tamil Nadu, however, came down significantly by 12.5% compared to 2019. This is despite the registered participants across the country going up by 5.1%.

Tamil Nadu saw the biggest drop in the country of 17,380 registered students from a total of 1,38,997 in 2019. It was followed by Kerala where the decline was only 1,775 (1.5%). The remaining eight that witnessed a decline were all Union Territories or States from the Northeast where the number of participants did not exceed 5,000.

The year 2020 also saw a decline in the number of participants taking the examination in Tamil. While 31,239 students took it in Tamil in 2019, it was 17,101 in 2020, down by 45.26%. Among the 11 languages in which the examination can be taken, Tamil saw a significant decline. Though there was a decline in Gujarati, Kannada and Telugu as well, they were negligible.

G.R. Ravindranath, general secretary, Doctors’ Association for Social Equality (DASE), said the increase in pass percentage must be seen positively. “Since our students were not used to medical entrance exams for a few years, they could not do well initially. The increase in pass percentage shows they are beginning to cope,” he said.

Stressing that he was opposed to NEET for a number of reasons, he said the Tamil Nadu government must allocate a considerable portion of its budget towards education for NEET coaching centres.

On the decline in the number of registered participants, he said it was necessary to wait for another year to see if the trend continued. He pointed out that the numbers were growing in the previous year. “This year, many rural students may not have applied owing to the COVID-19 situation and the inability to apply online,” he said.

He added that if Tamil Nadu could implement 7.5% horizontal reservation for government school students, it would bring in more students.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/94pucs/article32596158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA14-WAIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/neet-pass-percentage-goes-up-in-state/article32884428.ece
176,2020/10/18,Small and medium units face new challenge,"Several entrepreneurs are unable to pay their employees festival advance and bonus

With the festive season drawing near, businessmen and entrepreneurs in the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector are facing a new challenge: paying their employees festival advance and bonus.

With trade yet to revive and reach pre-COVID-19 levels, businessmen are worried. While some units are requesting their employees for more time, the others are giving a fraction of the amount.

K.E. Raghunathan, convener of the Consortium of Indian Associations, said two things happen in the sector during Ayudha Puja — a bonus is given, almost one-month salary, and a request for salary advance, which is another one-month salary. The money given varies from company to company and depends on the number of years an employee has worked.

“Currently, almost 70% of MSMEs have no additional cash left. EMI pressure is quite high. Most of the entrepreneurs paid money during non-working days during the lockdown,” Mr. Raghunathan said. With no relief from the State or the Centre, payment of bonus and salary advances are going to be a big challenge...,” he added.

The head of an MSME unit in Coimbatore said he would be able to give only 50% of the bonus. Only 60% of his workforce resumed work, while the others were yet to return from their respective States. “I’m already paying salaries (a certain amount) to the migrant workers who are yet to return. If I don’t pay, they will not come back,” he said, adding the order inflow was yet to pick up.

“Being a small-scale industry, we want to retain our staff. So we are planning to give 50%-60% bonus,” said K. Baskaran, secretary of the Kakkalur Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association. He said business was picking up, but there was a huge manpower shortage.

R.G. Chakrapani, secretary of the Thirumazhisai Industrial Estate, said only some segments were doing fairly well. Among them were two-wheeler, small car, tractor-based units. Some were exporting spill-over orders. “The companies which are catering to these segments are planning to pay 8.33% (one-month salary) in bonus. Other companies are planning to pay 50% of the 8.33% for Deepavali and 50% for Pongal.”

A. Shanmugavelayutham, who runs electrical transformer manufacturing units in Guindy Industrial Estate and Thirumudivakkam, said, “Many units are wondering how to pay bonus. But I have decided to pay my employees and I’m working on a formula.”

Mr. Shanmugavelayutham said raw material costs had increased suddenly, casting a burden on the sector.

At the Ambattur Industrial Estate, the business is better since many units are supplying to the automobile sector. Orders are coming in for these companies, but payments are getting delayed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/small-and-medium-units-face-new-challenge/article32884426.ece

Addressing the virtual conference ‘SICCI 360’, organised by the South Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Saturday, she said the world was seeing a million more cases roughly every three days.

She said the actual number of infections could be about ten times or even twenty times higher than the diagnosed and reported number of around 39 million cases across the world.

Highlighting the importance of having proper death reporting systems, she said the death toll due to COVID-19 and the excess deaths happening during the pandemic could be higher as many countries lacked proper mechanisms.

178,2020/10/18,"1,633 from govt. and aided schools clear NEET in State","As many as 1,633 students out of 6,692 students from government and aided schools in Tamil Nadu have cleared the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) 2020. These are candidates who were attempting the examination for the first time this year and had attended the free coaching provided by the State government through the year.

Four students from government-aided schools have scored over 500 marks, and 14 students from government-aided schools and one student from a government school have scored between 400 to 500 marks, data made available by the School Education Department indicated.

In 2019, only two students from government-aided schools had scored above 400 marks and no students from government institutions had scored above 500 marks.

A senior official of the School Education Department said that this year, more students had scored better than the previous years. “There are 71 students, who include four students from the Tamil medium branch, who have scored between 300 and 400 marks. This is a definite improvement from last year,” he said.

Online course

While the Education Department annually conducts a month-long residential crash course programme, ‘Thoduvanam’, it was done away with this year owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and an online free coaching programme was introduced. Students like S. Achuthan from Tiruchi depended on this online coaching entirely. “They provided a mobile application called E-Box with explainer videos and daily tests. When I had doubts, I could go back to that specific video,” he said.

For some other students, a mix of the coaching provided by the government as well as self-study worked. R. Aishwarya, a resident of Poondi Village in Ranipet district, who scored 353 marks in the examination, said that she mainly relied on self-study.

N.D. Keren Luxia Mai, a student of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Othakkadai who scored 320 in examination, said the online classes were out of reach for many government school students. “Many of my friends did not have smartphones and hence they couldn’t attend the online classes. There were also some difficulties in understanding classes that were held in English” she said.

In districts like Madurai, the Education Department stepped in to help students with phone data recharge to attend classes.

K.P.O. Suresh, president, Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association, said there were still concerns that had to be addressed with regard to effective coaching. “We are hoping that there is a positive outcome to the quota being asked for government school students in the MBBS seat intake to ensure that they have a level playing field,” he added.

Apart from the crash course which is conducted in the run-up to NEET for these students, there are free weekend coaching classes conducted in their schools from September. “This year, however, there is no word on when this coaching will begin for students... If we want students to do better, we should keep the momentum going right from the start,” said a teacher from a government school.

Artistes with some minimum experience in front of a camera and from an economically backward background now have a chance to hone their skills while sitting at home.

Cinema Rendezvous will conduct an advanced online workshop on acting for camera ‘Actor’s Euphoria’, with actor Shylaja Chetlur and director Naga, of Marmadesam fame, training candidates for two weekends. As part of this, three deserving candidates will be able to participate for free.

Ms. Chetlur said, “There are several artistes from television or theatre medium who want to hone their skills but owing to various reasons are unable to get the training they require. So, we will choose three persons who have some prior experience from small towns or rural areas to get this online training for free while staying home. The others can register by writing to us and will be chosen based on their experience and will have to pay a fee.”

The idea behind hosting such workshops is to provide the right kind of training for artistes with more content being generated online in OTT platforms post-lockdown. “We will teach them how to work with themselves, the character given to them and with the medium they face. They will be taught how to handle silence, props and modulation. This will help them perform well and get better opportunities,” she said.

He was addressing members of the travel and tourism trade at a webinar organised by the South India MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions) Association and moderated by senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai.

Mr. Kapur said this would put money in the pockets of travellers, which in turn would revive the industry and lead to the money being ploughed back into the economy as taxes. He also suggested that the industry, which was the worst affected in the pandemic, should take steps to attract international travellers, who have not flown out of the country.

Ajay Bakaya, managing director, Sarovar Hotels, said the industry, which contributed 10% of the country’s gross domestic product and employed 10% of work force, needed some serious intervention.

Thousands of people employed in the sector had been rendered jobless. Requests for a two-year moratorium on interest rates and repayment of the principal loan amount was still under consideration.

Mr. Bakaya further said that occupancy rates had climbed marginally from 22% in July to 32% in September. However, business class hotels had not crossed beyond single digit occupancy and the industry expected the situation to continue till January, he said.

The Madras High Court has quashed criminal defamation proceedings initiated by the State government against the chairman, Editor-in-Chief, Associate Editor and reporter of Rediff.com for carrying a news article on July 10, 2015 accusing the media of not reporting widely about the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s failing health.

Justice P.N. Prakash said the fact that Jayalalithaa was not keeping well became very obvious on May 23, 2015 when the whole world watched the unprecedented act of her entire Cabinet of 28 Ministers take oath in two batches, in a ceremony that hardly lasted for 30 minutes, instead of the usual practice of taking oath individually.

No basis

The judge agreed with senior counsel R. Shunmugasundaram, representing the chairman and employees of the web portal, that the criminal defamation proceedings initiated against them in 2015 had no leg to stand on. He quashed the defamation proceedings launched through the City Public Prosecutor.

The judge also pointed out that the news article in the web portal had only found fault with the mainstream media for not reporting about Jayalalithaa’s health condition and it did not refer to any particular ailment suffered by her or made any disparaging remark about her health. It only highlighted that Jayalalithaa was not very active.

The article stated that she had been visiting the Secretariat only twice a week after assuming office as Chief Minister for the second time in May 2015 and did not remain there for more than 30 minutes. The brief window was used to inaugurate government schemes through video conference and even the prestigious Chennai Metro was inaugurated that way. There was absolutely no interaction with the media and only select television crews as well as photographers were allowed to capture the Chief Minister visually.

“Surprisingly, there has not been even a murmur of protest from any of the media outlets for the nauseating development,” the article stated and claimed that her poor health had affected government administration.

Pending files

Opposing the quash petition, State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan pointed out that the news article had quoted an anonymous IAS officer to have said that files used to move even when a “dummy” government under the Chief Ministership of O. Panneerselvam (now Deputy Chief Minister) was in place whereas an absolute paralysis was staring at them due to Jayalalithaa’s failing health.

He argued that this anonymous quote was untrue and defamatory. However, Justice Prakash brushed aside the argument on the ground that “an allegedly defamatory article must be read as a whole and not in bits and pieces. An assessment of the state of affairs of the administration at a given point of time cannot amount to defamation”.

The judge went on to state: “Right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution is sacrosanct though it can be restricted on the grounds set out in Article 19(2). The press has a duty to keep the public informed about the happenings in the administration of the State. If this freedom is stifled, rumours and gossips will masquerade as truth.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kuhlyd/article32884118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18JAYALALITHAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-quashes-proceedings-against-web-portal/article32884119.ece

183,2020/10/18,"Is T.N. under Governor’s rule, asks Ramadoss","Bill on quota being thwarted, he says

PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Saturday invoked the words of DMK founder and former chief minister Annadurai to criticise the role of the Governors in India.

Quoting Annadurai, Dr. Ramadoss said, “There is no need for a beard for a goat nor a governor for the States and removing both will have no impact on the goat or the States’.

Dr. Ramadoss’ comments come a day after he criticised the Governor of Tamil Nadu for not signing off on State’s decision to provide 7.5% reservations for government school students in Tamil Nadu in medical courses.

“Despite 32 days having passed since Tamil Nadu assembly passed a Bill to provide 7.5% reservations for the government school students, Tamil Nadu Governor has not signed it to make it official. This is not a delay that has happened naturally. This is a planned attempt (to cause a delay),” he posted on social media on Friday.

He further asked whether Tamil Nadu is under Governor’s rule since a Bill passed in the Tamil Nadu Assembly is being thwarted.

TNCC president K.S. Alagiri on Saturday demanded that Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit immediately give assent to the Bill providing 7.5% reservation for government school students who have qualified in NEET.

“This Bill was passed by the Assembly on September 15 but is waiting for the Governor’s assent. All parties have been demanding that this 7.5% reservation be implemented from the current academic year but the Governor has not taken any decision on it yet. This gives rise to suspicion that the BJP has some agenda on the issue,” Mr. Alagiri said.

Mr. Alagiri said 19,000 students who had taken training in 412 coaching centres set up by the Tamil Nadu government had not cleared NEET.

‘Shameful situation’

Two girls who studied at the Government Higher Secondary School at Velliangadu, near Karamadai, in Coimbatore district have cleared the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) in their first attempt without any special coaching.

S. Ramya of a Scheduled Tribe (ST) and P. Bistis Prisca of a Scheduled Caste (SC) scored 145 and 167 marks respectively. The qualifying marks for the SC/ST candidates ranged from 113 to 146.

Neither attended any private coaching class. “I prepared only using the Class XI and Class XII textbooks,” said Ms. Ramya, daughter of a daily wage labourer.

She did not attend the online crash course organised by the Department of School Education in June. “We could not visit the houses of our teachers owing to the COVID-19 [lockdown] to clarify our doubts,” she said.

“Passing this [NEET] itself is an achievement,” said Ms. Bistis, daughter of a tailor. She said she used the Class XI and XII textbooks extensively for the preparation. However, Ms. Bistis Prisca said she attended the online crash course for three days for each subject — Biology, Physics and Chemistry. Both want to become cardiologists.

186,2020/10/18,Inundated areas to be sanitised with sodium hypochlorite,"Usually, viruses find cold temperatures favourable, and the same is anticipated with COVID-19

Thousands of Hyderabadis who are still reeling under reeling under COVID-19 are facing another challenge. Apart from possible spike in COVID-19 cases, the silt, filth, murky water that the recent floods in Hyderabad has brought into and around homes the risk of water-borne, food-borne and mosquito-borne diseases.

From the past seven months, the Health Department officials have been urging people to wear masks, maintain physical distance and hand hygiene, to avoid COVID-19.

Because of the incessant rains in the past few days and its aftermath, the officials added another precaution - which is to - consume hot food, drink water which is boiled and cooled down.

Apart from the gusty rains on October 13, the rains on Saturday night led to inundation in more areas.

The localities in Hyderabad which are inundated will be sanitised using sodium hypochlorite solution after clearing silt and garbage, said Telangana Director of Public Heath Dr. G. Srinivasa Rao when asked if COVID-19 might spread further in the localities since coronavirus spreads through droplets.

As asymptomatic COVID-19 patients too might spread the virus, one such patient in rain relief camps in the city could infect other people. To avoid this, the State Health Department staff is conducting Rapid Antigen Tests on people who are rescued from inundated localities. Around 182 health camps are held at rain relief centres.

The COVID-19 tests were conducted on around 2,000 people who showed symptoms of COVID-19, and 19 have tested positives. A total of 14,961 people were examined for various illnesses at the camps. Of them, 1,055 were detected with fever, and 235 had diarrhoea.

There are two more factors which could lead to increase in COVID-19 cases - upcoming festivals and winters. Dussera, Diwali, Christmas will be celebrated in coming days. Currently, Bathukamma is being celebrated.

The officials urged people to avoid mass gatherings, and to celebrate the festivals with family members.

Usually, viruses find cold temperatures favourable. The same is anticipated with coronavirus.

Dr Srinivasa stressed that coming months till January is crucial and asked people to continue maintaining precautions. The Health Department has launched special campaign to promote precautionary measures.

187,2020/10/18,3 IS operatives from Hyderabad convicted by NIA Special Court,"The accused wanted commit acts of terrorism at the behest of their foreign handlers

Three Islamic State (IS) operatives from Hyderabad were among the 15 people sentenced to rigorous imprisonment by a special court for National Investigation Agency (NIA) cases in New Delhi.

The three persons were sentenced in a conspiracy case in Delhi, registered by the agency in 2015. Nafees Khan alias Fatima Khan alias Abu Zarrar of Madhapur, Mohammed Shariff Moinudeen from Tolichowki and Mohammed Obedullah of Saidabad were among the accused awarded prison terms along with a fine.

The orders were passed by Special Judge for NIA Parveen Singh on Friday.

While Nafees Khan was sentenced to 10 years RI with a fine of ₹1.03 lakh, Moinudeen and Obedullah got five years RI each and a fine of ₹38,000.

The case was registered by the NIA, New Delhi, on September 12, 2015, and pertains to criminal conspiracy by the ISIS to establish its base in India by recruiting Muslim youth using different social media platforms.

During the investigation, searches were conducted in various cities across the country and 19 accused were arrested.

190,2020/10/18,Tension at Assam-Mizoram border as many hurt in violent clash,"A meeting, chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, between both the States will be held on Monday to take stock of the situation

Simmering tension prevailed on the Assam-Mizoram border after a violent clash took place between the people of the two States, injuring several, officials said on Sunday.

The situation is now under control in the area, which is in Kolasib district of Mizoram and Cachar district of Assam, they said.

A meeting, chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, between both the States will be held on Monday to take stock of the situation, Mizoram Home Minister Lalchamliana said.

Chief secretaries of the two States will be present in the meeting, he said.

The two States have deployed security personnel, including those of the Indian Reserve Battalion, in the violence-hit areas near the Vairengte village in Mizoram and Assam’s Lailapur, officials said.

Vairengte in Kolasib district is on the northern fringe of Mizoram through which the National Highway 306 (formerly 54) passes, linking the State to Assam. The nearest village in Assam is Lailapur, which is in the Cachar district.

Kolasib district deputy commissioner H. Lalthlangliana told PTI that a large number of Vairengte residents assembled when some people from Assam, armed with sticks and dao, pelted stones at a group near the auto-rickshaw stand on the outskirts of the border village on Saturday evening.

The irate mob from Vairengte retaliated and set on fire about 20 temporary bamboo huts and stalls built along the national highway by residents of Lailapur despite a prohibitory order being in place, he said.

One of the injured persons, who suffered a cut in his neck, was admitted to the Kolasib district hospital and the condition was critical. Three people were being treated at a Public Health Centre (PHC) in Vairengte, he said.

“Despite the prohibitory order under Section 144 of the CrPC and policemen trying their best, the situation turned violent and became out of control as people gathered in large numbers,” he said.

Demolition of makeshift hut

The incident could be the fallout of the demolition of a makeshift hut used by local volunteers who guard the inter-State border near the Saihaipui ‘V’ village, about 3 km from Vairengte, he said.

The volunteers are guarding the border to check the movement of the people in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lalthlangliana said no one died in the clash and one person from Assam was admitted at Silchar Medical College and Hospital.

He said that he has spoken to Cachar deputy commissioner Keerthi Jalli over the violence and asked her to take measures to ensure that the national highway, which has been blocked by the local people, is cleared at the earliest.

The Assam government also said that the situation is under control and senior officials along with police are in the area to defuse the tension.

The State’s forest Minister Parimal Shuklabaidya, who is the MLA of Dholai in Cachar, told PTI that such incidents happen in the area every year as people from both the sides illegally cut trees.

Suklabaidya, on the direction of Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, visited Lailapur during the day and interacted with the people.

The incident was the handiwork of miscreants to create disturbance in the community, a statement issued by the Assam government quoted him as saying.

Assuring the people living close to the border of safety and security, Suklabaidya said he would place their demands of police outpost and other security-related issues to higher authorities.

“The government is with you all and will take necessary steps,” he told the locals.

Jalli, the deputy commissioner of Cachar, also visited the area along the inter-State border.

She assured the locals that the administration would provide them the security to ward off the “evil machinations at work” to create disturbance between the people of the two States.

Commissioner (Home) Gyanendra Tripathi assured the local people of protection and urged them to live in harmony with the people of Mizoram.

Assam’s DIG Southern Range Dilip Kumar Dey, Additional Deputy Commissioner Rajib Roy, and Circle Officer of Sonai Sudeep Nath were also in the area.

“We got reports of a few temporary houses and stalls being burnt. Police reached the spot and brought the situation under control. We are taking all possible steps to ensure such incidents do not recur in near future,” Cachar’s Superintendent of Police Bhanwar Lal Meena said.

Security has been beefed up in Lailapur and along the inter-State border, the Assam government said in the statement.

However, former Silchar MP Sushmita Dev of the Congress earlier told PTI that she visited the troubled area but found no officials there.

Lalthangliana said the Kolasib district administration is giving shelter to truck drivers, mostly from Assam, at Kolasib town and Kawnpui village and volunteers of the Young Mizo Association (YMA) provided them food.

Mizoram’s MNF MLA Lalrintluanga Sailo, who is camping at Vairengte, said that his State is not hostile to Assam or its people but is protecting its territory from infiltration by illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, who are living in the border areas.

He claimed that more than 80% of people living along the Assam-Mizoram border are illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.

Mr Sailo alleged that the border dispute is a ploy by some politicians with vested interests to take advantage in view of the Assam election, likely to be held early next year.

At least 11 MLAs of Mizoram’s ruling party MNF, including deputy speaker Lalrinawma, are at present camping in Vairengte.

Mizoram CM holds meeting

Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga also held a cabinet meeting over the border dispute during the day.

“I sincerely request everyone to maintain peace and to kindly not bypass any administrative proceedings,” he tweeted.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, home minister Lalchamliana said the Mizoram government has urged Assam to make efforts to defuse the tension and restore peace and tranquility in the border area.

He alleged that recently troubles were created by Assam at three border points -- Thinghlun in Mamit district, and Saihapui ‘V’ and Vairengte, both in Kolasib.

“We have approached the Centre over the border dispute. Accordingly, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla will hold a virtual meeting with chief secretaries of the two States on Monday to defuse the prevailing border standoff,” he said.

At least seven people from Mizoram were injured in the clash that took place on Saturday night, he said.

He said that the State government has sent reinforcement to the border area to stabilise the situation.

Asserting that a 509-square-miles stretch of the inner-line reserve forest notified in 1875 was the actual Mizoram’s boundary with Assam, the state home minister said, “We are not trying to encroach on Assam’s territory but faithfully protecting our land at all cost.”

According to Lalchamliana, Mizoram is likely to face a shortage of essential commodities, especially cooking gas and fuel, due to the indefinite blockade by residents of Lailapur on the national highway, which is the lifeline of the state.

He urged the people, especially traders, not to hoard commodities and hike their prices.

He further asked civil bodies not to act on their own and break law and order.

Mizoram Chief Secretary Lalnunmawia Chuaungo said that the State government has consented to the formation of a boundary commission and officially intimated the matter to the Centre.

He said that the core committee constituted by the State government in connection with the State boundary is studying and assessing old maps and documents.

The two States are often at loggerheads over the boundary, which they dispute.

Recently, a standoff took place near Thinghlun village in Mizoram’s Mamit district on the border with Assam’s Karimganj when Assam officials allegedly demolished a farm hut erected on the disputed land.

Mizoram shares a 164.6-km border with Assam.

Several dialogues held since 1995 to resolve the border dispute have yielded little results.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/at49x/article32887346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BORDERFENCEKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tension-at-assam-mizoram-border-as-many-hurt-in-violent-clash/article32887347.ece

Farmers suffering crop losses due to heavy rains stopped the convoy of Maharashtra Minister Vijay Wadettiwar in Nanded district on Sunday and demanded that instead of survey tours, the government provide them immediate help.

The farmers also gave a representation to the State Disaster Management, and Relief and Rehabilitation Minister to declare ‘wet famine’, and threatened that they would protest in Mumbai if their demands are not fulfilled.

Later, talking to reporters, Mr. Wadettiwar, who visited the district to assess damage caused due to heavy rains over the past few days, assured the farmers that those affected by the heavy showers will be provided assistance once the government receives the survey reports.

As the Minister arrived in Nanded’s Salgara village, some farmers stopped his convoy and said instead of survey tours, they should be provided aid immediately.

The farmers also informed him about the hurdles they were facing in availing crop loans from banks.

Mr. Wadettiwar later said, “As soon as the survey reports are received by the government, help will be commenced immediately.”

He said the State government would also seek aid for farmers from the Centre.

“The State government had earlier helped farmers who were affected by the cyclone Nisarg by changing the criteria (of financial aid),” he said.

Goa Health Minister Vishwajit Rane on Sunday said strict action will be taken as visuals of jam-packed night clubs in the tourism-heavy state flooded social media amid the coronavirus outbreak.

He said he would meet Chief Minister Pramod Sawant later in the day to discuss the issue, adding that district administration would be instructed to cancel the licenses of the clubs which have violated social distancing norms in this manner.

Mr. Rane said encouraging tourism, a major part of the State’s economy, under the “unlocking” process was important but violation of social distancing norms cannot be allowed.

195,2020/10/18,Second accused arrested in Barabanki rape and murder case,"Police have upgraded the charges to gang rape.

The police have arrested a second person in connection with the rape and murder of a minor girl in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, on October 14 and upgraded the charges to gang rape.

On the basis of information gathered from arrested accused Dinesh Gautam, 19, a second accused Rishikesh Singh, 21, was arrested, said Additional SP Barabanki Ram Sewak Gautam.

Singh runs a kirana store in the village, said police.

On October 14, Singh had informed Dinesh Gautam that the minor girl had gone to paddy field alone, said the Additional SP.

The police lodged a case under murder and also invoked Section 376 D (gang rape) of the IPC, POCSO Act and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act.

The body of the minor girl who was raped and killed, was found in a paddy field at Satrikh area in Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh late on Wednesday.

Police initially registered a murder case but after the post-mortem report confirmed rape, charges under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code were included in the FIR. POCSO Act was included in the FIR after it came to light from the victim’s documents that she was under 18.

The girl had gone out and when she failed to return, her father went in search of her and found the body in a field.

In the police complaint lodged against unknown accused, he said someone had strangulated his daughter.

196,2020/10/18,"Follow Biden’s pledge, Chidambaram tells Indian voters","Jacinda Ardern’s victory gives us hope that decency and progressive values can win elections in a democracy, the former Union Minister said.

Citing U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s remark about choosing “hope over fear and unity over division”, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Sunday that people in poll-bound Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere should take a similar vow.

In a series of tweets, the Congress leader also mentioned the election victory of Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand to assert that “progressive” values can win elections in a democracy.

“Mr. Joe Biden, Democratic candidate in the U.S. elections, said yesterday: ‘We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction and yes, truth over lies’. That’s a good vow that the people of Bihar, MP and elsewhere should take when they go to the polling booths this month,” Mr. Chidambaram tweeted.

Apart from the three-phase Assembly polls in Bihar beginning October 28, byelections will be held in as many as 56 Assembly seats across 12 States, including 28 seats in Madhya Pradesh, on November 3 and 7.

Commenting on the landslide victory of Ms. Ardern, who has been re-elected as the New Zealand Prime Minister, the former Union Minister said it gave him ‘hope’. “The election of Ms. Jacinda Ardern as Prime Minister of New Zealand gives us hope that decency and progressive values can win elections in a democracy,” he tweeted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ajt7vq/article32847238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14CHIDAMBARAMNEWS3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/chidambaram-cites-joe-biden-asks-voters-in-mp-bihar-to-choose-unity-over-division/article32885386.ece
197,2020/10/18,Punjab BJP leader quits over farm laws,"Neither State unit nor central leadership paying heed to farmers’ demands, Malvinder Kang says.

BJP general secretary and core committee member Malvinder Kang has resigned from the party over the Centre’s agriculture sector legislations, as he felt that neither party’s State nor the central leadership was paying heed to the demands to address the concerns of farmers’ surrounding the laws.

Peeved over the indifferent attitude of the party leadership towards farmers’ anxiety, Mr. Kang in his resignation letter to the State president wrote: “The farmers, ‘arhtiyas’ [commission agents], small traders and labour organisations have been democratically and rightly protesting the new Acts passed by the Central government. As a general secretary of the State BJP and being a member of the core group of the party, I raised my voice in support of the protesting farmers and others ... I requested the party’s State and central leadership many times to address their grievances but no positive step was taken ... therefore, supporting the farmers agitation, I resign from the party post, core group and primary membership.”

Also read: Who gains and who loses from the farm Bills?

A day after Mr. Kang’s resignation, BJP state president Ashwani Sharma on Sunday told The Hindu that he had not received the resignation. “I have come to know about it through newspapers. Unless I receive the resignation, I can’t say anything on it,” he said.

Mr. Kang told reporters that he felt relieved after quitting. “I had been under pressure since the time farmers began protesting ... I was not able to support the farmers in their fight for their right. I raised the concerns of farmers surrounding farm laws on party platforms, but no one paid heed. When I realised that no one is hearing me, I decided to quit,” he said.

Media adviser to Punjab Chief Minister Raveen Thukral, on Twitter, said “First its oldest ally quits, then Punjab farmers block the entry of its leaders in villages and now their own leaders are resigning, and still @BJP4India claims Farm laws are beneficial to the farmers.

198,2020/10/18,One held in Gujarat for placing fake job ad in local dailies,"The accused and his accomplices received around ₹14 lakh from aspirants

Two days after a job advertisement appeared in local dailies calling for applications to various categories by paying a nominal fee online, the Gujarat police on Saturday arrested one Sandeep Pandya, who allegedly placed it.

The advertisement titled direct recruitment by “Gujarat Employment Services” appeared in the local newspapers resembled as if it was issued by the government for openings in its various departments.

While lodging a case immediately after the ad appeared, the State authorities also cautioned the job aspirants to ignore it.

The police have lodged a case under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 419 and 420 (cheating) and provisions of the Information Technology Act.

“Based on a technical analysis, Pandya was found responsible for placing the advertisement and probe is under way to track down others involved in the scam,” the police said.

After the advertisement appeared, around ₹14 lakh was collected by the accused and his accomplices.

The applicants were asked to fill a form on the website www.gujarates.co.in and deposit ₹300 as application fee for jobs that came with the incentive of work from home due to the pandemic.

The ad sought applications from those between 18 and 50 for 2,520 vacancies for six posts like business development officer, customer service officer, district officer, computer operator etc, on an 11-month contract.

The advertisement also offered salaries ranging from ₹8,500 to ₹25,500 for the posts specified in it while educational qualification for all jobs was mentioned as 12th passed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/one-held-in-gujarat-for-placing-fake-job-ad-in-local-dailies/article32884322.ece
199,2020/10/18,Gujjars give ultimatum till Nov. 1 on quota issue,"Gujjars demanding reservation in jobs and education as a “most backward class” (MBC) on Saturday gave an ultimatum till November 1 to the Congress government in Rajasthan before resumption of their agitation, unless urgent steps were taken to protect their “rightful share” and quota provisions applied to the ongoing recruitment to 15 services.

Gujjar supremo Kirori Singh Bainsla announced at the community’s ‘Mahapanchayat’ (grand convention) at Adda village near Bayana in Bharatpur district that Gujjars were willing to give some time to the State government, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and sowing season for rabi crops, to act on its promises.

Col. Bainsla indicated that the agitating Gujjars could block traffic on the Delhi-Mumbai railway tracks passing through Bharatpur, Karauli and Sawai Madhopur districts, and on the highways to press for their demands. “We have held several meetings with the government’s representatives, but there was no result... The agitation will begin on November 1,” he said.

Gujjars have been seeking inclusion of a reservation law passed by the State Assembly last year in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, appointments to backlog posts, benefit of 5% reservation in the ongoing recruitments, regularisation of 1,252 employees appointed through the MBC quota, and implementation of Devnarayan Scheme for the community’s progress and welfare.

Internet services remained suspended in parts of Bharatpur district on Saturday in view of the Mahapanchayat, in which about 5,000 people participated. State Labour Secretary Niraj K. Pawan, sent to interact with the Gujjar leaders, said all demands of the community had been fulfilled, though some minor subjects were pending because of technical issues.

Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra said the Gujjar leaders should talk to the 25 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs elected from the State to get the reservation law included in the Ninth Schedule, as it fell within the domain of the Centre in order to protect the legislation against judicial scrutiny.

The Assembly had passed the Rajasthan Backward Classes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions in the State and of Appointments and Posts in Services under the State) Amendment Act, 2019, on February 13 last year. Four other nomadic communities given the quota benefit along with the Gujjars are Banjara, Gadia-Lohar, Raika and Gadariya.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gujjars-give-ultimatum-till-nov-1-on-quota-issue/article32884343.ece
200,2020/10/18,Odisha villagers create river mouth,"Natural opening had choked and sea-side areas faced deluge

Hundreds of fishermen have come together to excavate a new river mouth to prevent their villages from being inundated by the Rushikulya river in Odisha’s Ganjam district.

As the natural river mouth got choked, the sea-side villages faced deluge due to overtopping of water. They had appealed to the district administration to help discharge of river water into Bay of Bengal.

“Our repeated appeals fell on deaf ears. Subsequently, we took it upon ourselves to find a solution. Over 1,000 people from four villages joined hands and decided to dig an artificial mouth,” said Magata Behera of Purunabandh village.

The fishermen were also facing problems of docking their fishing boats along the beach which was witnessing steady erosion. They wanted a secured area for boat anchorage.

“For three days, people came with their own implements to dig a channel from the river to Bay of Bengal. They also pooled money to hire an earth-mover so that sand dunes could be moved at a faster pace,” said Rabindra Kumar Sahu, a volunteer.

After three days of collective efforts, the villagers managed to create a channel connecting Rushikulya and Bay of Bengal.

Mr. Sahu said the channel was important for the fisher-folks as they were walking a long distance to access their boats. The new mouth would help them take boats directly to sea, he said.

Residents of Purunabandha, Nolia Nuagaom, Sana Noliagaon, Gokharakuda, Padampeta and Kantigada would benefit by the artificial river mouth.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2393j0/article32884060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18RIVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-villagers-create-river-mouth/article32884061.ece
201,2020/10/18,Malik praises Sir Syed’s vision of a nation,"AMU should continue to lead in providing quality education, says Meghalaya Guv.

Sir Syed’s vision of a nation was one of the earliest expressions of an idea of India which includes all its inhabitants without distinctions on the basis of religion, caste or race, said Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik while delivering the Sir Syed Day commemoration address as the chief guest on Saturday.

Addressing AMU students in a virtual mode, he said, “You are the true realisation of Sir Syed’s dream as you are serving the nation with the true spirit of the ideals of Sir Syed.”

‘Example in healthcare’

Speaking in Hindustani, he stressed, “We are living in a challenging times due to the pandemic, but it is heartening to see that AMU rose to the occasion with full potential for serving humanity as its Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital has set an example for the nation by leaving no stone unturned in the healthcare of the patients.”

Describing AMU as a “historical and heritage institution”, Mr. Malik said it was a “common desire” of the nation that the university continues to “lead the country in providing quality education”. He said it was “our collective responsibility to provide full support for the welfare of this institution of prominence.”

Reminiscing the days when he represented Aligarh constituency as a Member of Parliament from 1989 to 1991 (on a Janata Dal ticket) and AMU Court simultaneously, he said that AMU became very dear to him.

He recalled that AMU faculty members, including eminent poet and lyricist late Prof. Shahryar, and the students had campaigned for him when he contested the Lok Sabha election. He claimed Prof. Irfan Habib and Prof. Shahryar distributed his voter identity slips.

The seasoned politician, who is seen as a rare socialist in the ruling dispensation, said one of the reasons he was appointed the Governor of Jammu & Kashmir was his stint as the MP of Aligarh. Mr. Malik, who was the Governor of J &K when Article 370 was revoked in August 2019, also spoke about the cooperation and help he received from AMU Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor in convincing the Kashmiri students to stay at AMU and not to return home during the tense period.

International category

Receiving the Sir Syed Excellence Award in the international category, eminent historian Dr. Gail Minault, Professor Emerita, Department of History, The University of Texas at Austin, US, discussed her research on the Khilafat Movement and how important it was for her not to rely just on British sources and find out what the Ali Brothers, and Abdul Bari Firangi Mahali, and Maulana Azad were writing, thinking, and saying.

Dr. Minault spoke about the help she received in her research from the families and descendants of the founders of schools, and the editors and publishers of Urdu journals, especially the family of Shaikh Abdullah of Aligarh, founder of Aligarh Girls’ School, which later became Aligarh Women’s College.

She made a special mention of Mumtaz Jahan Haidar, who was for many years the Principal of the Women’s College.

Anjuman-I-Islam, a Mumbai based educational conglomerate, was awarded Sir Syed Excellence Award in the national category.

In the welcome address, Prof. Mansoor said that Sir Syed brought about the great revolution that transformed the Indian society in all walks of life.

Later in the day, AMU Chancellor Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin inaugurated the Centenary Gate at the northern side of the AMU campus in virtual mode. The V-C, on behalf of the Executive Council, has named it ‘Centenary Gate’ and the name in Urdu has been inscribed on it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/y0e5n6/article32884035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18GATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/malik-praises-sir-syeds-vision-of-a-nation/article32884036.ece

The plants are expected to strengthen oxygen supply system in the health facilities where the patients are admitted.

203,2020/10/18,‘Onus is on Yogi to address allegations of Thakur appeasement’,"Uttar Pradesh deserves a modern approach and a leader with a big and liberal heart, says RLD vice-president

Rashtriya Lok Dal vice-president Jayant Chaudhary speaks on the upcoming Assembly bypoll in Uttar Pradesh and days after he was lathi-charged by the police while going to Hathras to meet the family of the rape victim.

Your party has fielded a candidate in the upcoming bypoll in Bulandshahr and is supporting the SP in the other six seats. Is this your direction for the 2022 election as well?

Yes. We have been consistent on this. We tied up with them in the previous Lok Sabha and in the long term that is the kind of direction we want to give to U.P. Today people are realising that with a brute majority how the BJP is actually suppressing a lot of issues that should have been a priority on the development front. All it is talking about is Mughals, love jihad and divisive issues. With Akhilesh’s leadership and track record, and our grassroot connect, I think we can actually give an alternative to the voters.

Did you expect the police to lathicharge you in Hathras? Their explanation was that Opposition workers were breaching the COVID-19 protocol.

No. As far as COVID-19 goes, it gets very convenient because you get more people walking in a street market in any town in U.P. When incidents like these (Hathras rape) happen, people want to reach out to the family and express solidarity. The key operative thing here is that I was escorted past the barricade. The barricade is there to maintain order. It was the police’s failure that they could not enforce the barricade. There were five-six people on the other side of the barricade. What was the need for lathicharge? We were not posing any threat. If you look at the police manual in U.P. and the Supreme Court decisions, there are actually procedures in place. You have to give a warning. You need the presence of an administrative official. The SDM was there but he did not give any verbal warning. It was a violation of our rights as citizens. In the political space we are an Opposition, but I never really thought that something like that we will have to encounter.

Has there been a change in attitude of the U.P. police under the Yogi Adityanath government?

Top down, there is an impunity. Structures are put in place to reward violent behaviour and action by police, whether it is encounters, shooting someone or a lathicharge... this notion of strict policing. Yes, we need strict policing in U.P. but we also need sensitive policing. And in the Hathras incident, they should have been more sensitive. Their handling of the family, the complaint and the Opposition leaders who wanted to reach out, I think in all the three aspects, it showed a very insensitive side of the police. And Yogiji is the Home Minister. Who else will we hold responsible?

A section of the media is arguing that because of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s ventures in U.P., the Congress is emerging as a leading Opposition in the State threatening to dislodge the SP and its allies. Is it too far fetched?

The Congress has always been there. Every party is doing its own efforts. But it’s easier for the Congress because they are a mainstream national party and what they do perhaps gets more coverage. But they have no extraordinary impact on the grassroots right now.

Do you feel the BJP has a weak link in Yogi Adityanath’s personal image?

The BJP’s political strategy is to talk in many voices. From being a ‘right’ party, they have also gone a little bit extreme to the right and Yogi is also in the same framework. I think U.P. deserves a modern approach and a leader with a big and liberal heart. I think that space will exist for us to attack Yogi and the BJP. This hard-nosed might is right sort of politics, can’t survive in the long run.

There is an allegation that the State government is appeasing Thakurs, the caste Yogi was born into. Do you think such a thing exists and will it have an impact in the coming future?

The people who belong to the CM’s caste, either in arrogance or affinity, they feel it is ‘hamari sarkar’ (our government). You actually need a CM who can be a moral guiding force and then can tame his or her own supporters. On the other hand, what Yogiji is doing is he is not restraining anybody. It won’t be proper for me say if they are doing Thakurvad or not, but definitely there are visible signs and discussion is on, the onus is on Yogiji. Only he can address this issue.

You have held mahapanchayats with SP in Muzaffarnagar, Mathura and now Bulandshahr. You are opposed to the three new farms laws. What are you you telling the voters?

U.P. has relaxed some laws and a lot of crops were taken out of the APMC. The market infrastructure was already getting dismantled. Now these laws have come about and have raised a real concern on what will happen because eventually over 5-10 years if the market shifts to trade outside mandis into private hands, will they crowd out the state? And what will be the role of these mandis? Will the government stop purchasing from farmers? What will be the viability of MSP? These are the concerns that should have been addressed. But a government that is so eloquent in communicating its political messages in election time, it has been its typical failure in communication [on farm laws].

Farmer leaders of Haryana and Punjab stormed out of the Krishi Bhawan completely disgruntled and tore the copies of the laws. You have a crisis in Punjab, because farmers are sitting there on a rail roko. But somehow the national mainstream reporting is not showing the alarm that should be there. And nor is the government responding. It is clear no farmer or farmer organisation actually asked for these changes or reforms. They are unpalatable for the farmer but they are being told it is beneficial for them.

What do you feel about the government’s repeated allegations that the Opposition leaders were trying to trigger a caste riot over the Hathras incident?

It’s so easy when an upper caste Chief Minister talks about crime not being caste-specific. When, in fact, we do know that the weaker sections get targeted. There is a reason why the Home Ministry and the NCRB collect data on Dalit atrocities. And Dalit women are often targets of such crimes. As per the latest report in 2019, 10 Dalit women are raped daily. When I visited the family, we saw and heard of panchayats [by caste groups] happening... It’s really shocking that you have public mobilisation to garner support for a rape accused. It’s never happened in our country before. We have had agitations to support the victim.

This is a dehumanising experiment that the BJP has indulged in.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vh77oc/article32884022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18JAYANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/onus-is-on-yogi-to-address-allegations-of-thakur-appeasement/article32884023.ece

Uttar Pradesh police on Saturday said it would invoke the stringent National Security Act and Gangster Act against the accused in the killing of a 46-year-old man at a meeting attended by senior administration and police officials here two days ago, even as a local BJP leader, who allegedly shot the victim, continued to evade the cops.

Reward announced

A total of five people have been arrested and another five detained in connection with the Thursday incident. Also, 12 teams have been formed to nab the other accused, including local BJP leader Dhirendra Pratap Singh, according to the police, which has announced a cash reward of ₹50,000 on their arrest.

The FIR had named eight accused and mentioned “20-25” unidentified people in the incident during which Dhirendra Pratap Singh allegedly shot dead Jai Prakash as a fracas broke out at the meeting at Durjanpur village over the allotment of ration shops.

The incident has snowballed into a major political controversy after BJP MLA from Bariya Assembly seat Surendra Singh came out in support of the main accused.

On Saturday, Surendra Singh visited Reoti police station with the family members of the accused, claiming that they had also suffered injuries in the incident and an FIR should be registered.

Delegations of the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party met the family of the deceased and attacked the Yogi Adityanath government.

“A cash reward of ₹50,000 has been announced on each of the absconding accused. Action will also be initiated under the National Security Act and the Gangster Act against the accused,” DIG (Azamgarh Range) Subhash Chandra Dubey.

Among the arrested are Narendra Pratap Singh, brother of Dhirendra Pratap Singh, and Devendra Pratap Singh.

Three of the ‘unnamed accused” were identified as Munna Yadav, Raj Pratap Yadav and Rajan Tewari and were arrested on Saturday, Additional Superintendent of Police Sanjay Yadav said.

The family of the deceased has demanded a compensation of ₹50 lakh, a government job for his son, pension to his widow, besides strict action against the culprits.

The police had admitted that there appeared to be “laxity” on their part and suspended nine personnel — three sub-inspectors and six constables — posted at Reoti police station.

Sub-Divisional Magistrate Suresh Chandra Pal and circle officer of police Chandrakesh Singh were suspended on the directions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath soon after the incident on Thursday.

The Samajwadi Party said that on its president Akhilesh Yadav’s direction, an eight-member delegation led by Dayaram Pal met the family of Jai Prakash and assured it of financial help from the party.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/up-police-to-invoke-nsa-in-ballia-firing-case/article32884006.ece

The coach also said that they learned from their mistake in the last game and ensured that de Villiers batted at his usual No. 4 spot. The South African star had come in at No. 6 against KXIP on Thursday.

“We certainly made sure that he batted in his right position today [Saturday]. We certainly learnt from our mistake and he was wonderful.

“The reason we won was I think he was magnificent, Chris Morris was brilliant, (Yuzvendra Chahal) got us back in the game with his two wickets, we had a number of crucial performances but AB basically won us the game single-handedly.”

‘Serious batting’

Royals captain Steve Smith said it was just “serious batting” by de Villiers, who made the penultimate over look so “awful“.

“In hindsight and now in the result, yeah absolutely,” Smith said when asked if he should have bowled Jofra Archer in the 19th over.

“But look, it is a tough one. Jaydev bowls this cutters and stuff into the wicket and bowls really well normally to a long boundary at the leg side. It wasn’t an awful over, it was some pretty serious batting to be honest.

“There are not too many guys who can hit the ball the way AB did, under pressure, to a big side and clear the fence very easily... But hindsights are a wonderful thing, isn’t it?",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/vhf7jz/article26937381.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25RCB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-ab-greatest-of-all-time-katich/article32887565.ece
208,2020/10/18,Indian Premier League | A move that proved costly,"Bowling Jadeja against the left-handers suited Capitals

Chennai Super Kings’ left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja bowling the final over was an advantage for the Delhi Capitals’ left-handed duo of Shikhar Dhawan and Axar Patel, the senior opener said after his maiden IPL hundred.

Dhawan scored 101, capitalising on the ‘lives’ he got, while Axar smashed three sixes in the final over as Capitals knocked off the required 17 runs for a five-wicket win here on Saturday.

“We knew (Dwayne) Bravo would not be able to bowl the last over and it would be Jadeja. Being left-handers, we had a certain advantage against him,” Dhawan said at the post-match press conference.

“Sam Curran bowled very well in the 19th over, his yorker execution was very good. There was dew and we took advantage of that as well,” Dhawan said.

He praised Axar’s contribution and said having a quality all-rounder makes a big difference.

“Axar Patel has been a great asset. Whenever we demand good overs from him, he does the job. He is normally very economical. Having a quality all-rounder makes a big difference.”

Being positive

On his own performance, Dhawan said he tries to remain positive and confident.

“I was always focusing on my process. I was playing well. I stayed positive and confident. Every time I score runs, I make mistakes as well. I was analysing what to do, what shot to play and what not to play. I pick and choose what shots to play or strategy I should use on different kinds of pitches.”

Dhawan felt the team was playing good cricket and everyone was doing their job. “It is a great feeling. The best thing is we are playing very good cricket, everyone is doing their job and that’s a great sign for us. We all stay hungry and we make sure that we focus on the process. We guys make sure that we stay fresh as well,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jitfbb/article32887558.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19AXAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-a-move-that-proved-costly/article32887559.ece
209,2020/10/18,"IPL 2020: SRH vs KKR | Getting Warner out in Super Over was special, says Lockie Ferguson","Lockie Ferguson took two wickets in the super over while conceding two runs.

He decisively turned the match in Kolkata Knight Riders’ favour with his exceptional bowling and no wonder Lockie Ferguson’s favourite moment was dismissing Sunrisers Hyderabad skipper David Warner off the first ball of the Super Over.

The Kiwi paceman bowled Warner with a full length delivery and Abdul Samad with a yorker respectively while conceded only two runs in the Super Over. This was after he took three wickets in Sunrisers Hyderabad’s chase in the regulation time.

KKR easily scored the required three runs to earn a much-needed win.

“Getting David Warner out especially at the start of the super over,” Ferguson said when asked about his favourite wicket in the match.

“It’s great having Morgs (Eoin Morgan) at the top off the mark with his calmness and of course I had my plan which was working throughout the game. Look we’ll take this win and enjoy tonight, it was a very good win on a tough wicket. It was nice to put the icing on the cake after the batsmen’s effort,” he said.

KKR skipper Morgan was relieved man after the win.

“For Lockie to come in and perform in both phases was outstanding. We’ve been sort of striving to get wins out of the last couple of games, didn’t happen against Mumbai; today we were competitive,” he said.

Talking about Andre Russell, who bowled the final over and managed to drag the contest to the Super Over, Morgan said, “Dre went off the field, we thought he was injured. He came back on and said he could bowl.”

“I think he showed a lot of character to get us to the Super Over after not starting well. He’s a superstar player for us. Hopefully we can gather up some momentum after this.”

Losing skipper Warner was at a loss of words to explain his feelings.

“I don’t know where to start. At the end of the day, we probably leaked a few too many in the middle overs and at the back end. For us it’s about finishing games and we’ve failed the last 2-3 occasions,” he said.

Warner said he does not think he made a wrong call by asking KKR to bat first on this wicket.

“Not at all in two minds about bowling first. I thought this was a nice wicket that wouldn’t change and to be fair it didn’t. 165 was about par. We lost wickets at crucial times again. Kane had to open because he had a slight niggle with his adductor. Will need some physio work,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mbo4qs/article32887205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FERGUSON,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-srh-vs-kkr-getting-warner-out-in-super-over-was-special-says-lockie-ferguson/article32887206.ece
210,2020/10/18,"Indian Premier League 2020, MI vs KXIP | Kings rule after incredible finish","Kings XI Punjab wins the second Super Over after the first ends in a tie against Mumbai Indians

If two Super Overs in a day wasn’t enough to fill the IPL fans’ appetite, outstanding exhibitions of executing yorkers by Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami meant the Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab created a first: that of a second Super Over after the first one was tied with both teams scoring five runs each.

And since the rules prescribed that batsmen dismissed in the first Super Over, along with the bowlers who bowled, were ineligible, it put MI in the drivers’ seat as Kieron Pollard and Hardik Pandya walked out to bat in the second.

However, Chris Jordan, who had leaked 20 runs to Pollard and Nathan Coulter-Nile in the 20th over in regulation time, resulting in Mumbai Indians’ total swelling to 176 for six, conceded just 11 runs. Jordan had Mayank Agarwal to thank for saving four runs with a stunning leap off the last ball of the over.

Trent Boult, who bowled an exceptional last over of the match that resulted in a tie, was then taken to the cleaners by Chris Gayle and Mayank as the duo scored 15 runs off just four balls.

The nail-biting win meant KXIP has kept its Indian Premier League campaign afloat.

The drama in the last four overs — two Super Over faceoffs — overshadowed the heroics of a few individuals in the first 40 overs.

Quinton de Kock anchored the MI innings after Rohit Sharma elected to bat first. Krunal Pandya came to the fore in resurrecting the innings after KXIP struck thrice in the PowerPlay. And Pollard’s cameo (34 n.o., 12b, 1x4, 4x6) resulted in MI setting up a formidable total.

Bumrah then got rid of three of the Kings XI Punjab’s most vital batsmen. Still, Rahul’s umpteenth effort of leading from the front, aided by Deepak Hooda’s finishing act, had bottom-placed KXIP within touching distance of upsetting the defending champion. It eventually did!

The Indian Premier League Suspect Bowling Action Committee has cleared Kolkata Knight Riders spinner Sunil Narine, the IPL said IN a statement ahead of KKR’s match against Sunrisers Hyderabad in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.

Narine was reported for “suspected illegal bowling action” during KKR’s match against Kings XI Punjab in Abu Dhabi on October 10. Following the report, Narine was placed on the Suspect Action Warning List.

After reviewing footage of Narine’s bowling action “with the naked eye”, the committee concluded “the elbow-bend appears to be within the range of permissible limits” and removed the West Indian from the warning list.

It noted: “Narine should reproduce the same action going forward in IPL 2020 matches as presented to the Committee in the video footage.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/10k5g0/article32834996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NARINEKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-sunil-narine-cleared-of-suspect-bowling-action/article32886310.ece

Sailing in the same boat, Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals lock horns in the Indian Premier League in Abu Dhabi on Monday with the knowledge that any more slip-up could dash their slim play-off hopes.

Both CSK and RR have failed to live up to the expectations so far and are placed sixth and seventh on the points table in the eight-team competition.

The two struggling teams have six points from nine games, but the defending champions are placed above on the net run rate.

With just five matches each remaining for both the teams, the road ahead is definitely going to be a tough and tricky one, and they know that they cannot afford any more lapses from hereon.

Both teams lost their respective last matches on Saturday. While the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side lost to table toppers Delhi Capitals by five wickets, Rajasthan Royals were defeated by seven wickets by Royal Challengers Bangalore.

The blow for CSK is bigger as their influential all-rounder, Dwayne Bravo, has been ruled out for at least a few days due to a groin injury.

After bringing life to their campaign with a win over Sunrisers Hyderabad, courtesy Dhoni’s smart captaincy, CSK were done in by sloppy fielding and Shikhar Dhawan’s scintillating 101-run knock while chasing a competitive 180-run target.

Dropped a number of times, Dhawan hit his maiden IPL hundred while Axar Patel smashed three sixes in the final over bowled by Ravindra Jadeja, to hand CSK their sixth loss.

It was a nightmarish outing for CSK fielders as they dropped Dhawan on 25 and 79, apart from failing to latch on to a half chance and a run-out opportunity, and Dhoni would certainly seek improvement in that department.

“Shikhar’s wicket was important but we dropped him quite a number of times. If he keeps batting, he will keep the strike rate high. Also the wicket played better in the second half, but we can’t take the credit away from Shikhar,” Dhoni had said after the last game.

RR also find themselves in a very difficult situation and desperately need to explore ways to close down games.

One good thing for RR is the return to form of their skipper Steve Smith, who made 57 on Saturday, but star all-rounder Ben Stokes is yet to fire after having joined the team late. While Jos Buttler has not been consistent enough with the bat.

Sanju Samson has been subdued after his early exploits while Robin Uthappa seems to have found some form at the top, scoring 41 off 22 balls against RCB.

The Jofra Archer-led bowling attack looked ordinary in front of the marauding RCB batsmen.

213,2020/10/18,Indian Premier League 2020: SRH vs KKR | Ferguson delivers for KKR in Super Over,"The Kiwi speedster, playing his first match of the season, brings cheer to the Kolkata camp.

Two wickets from Lockie Ferguson helped Kolkata Knight Riders snatch a thrilling Super Over victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. The Kiwi pacer nipped out David Warner and Abdul Samad in three deliveries, leaving KKR with just three runs to chase.

Earlier, KKR had the upper hand with SRH needing 18 to win off the final over. Warner swung the momentum SRH’s way with a hat-trick of fours off Andre Russell. With four required off two, Russell pulled it back, conceding just three and stretching the match to a Super Over.

Chasing 164, Jonny Bairstow (36, 28b, 7x4) and Kane Williamson (29, 19b, 4x4, 1x6) gave SRH a flying start. The side cruised to 58 for no loss in PowerPlay, before Ferguson, playing his first match, had Williamson caught off his first ball.

Priyam Garg, Bairstow and Manish Pandey then fell in quick succession before Pat Cummins accounted for Vijay Shankar. However, Warner’s unbeaten 33-ball 47 (5x4) ensured that the teams finished on an even keel.

Put in to bat, KKR scored just 15 off the first three overs before Rahul Tripathi switched gears, hitting T. Natarajan for a six and a four in the fourth over. At the other end, Shubman Gill (36, 37b, 5x4) broke the shackles with three back-to-back boundaries off Basil Thampi. However, Natarajan provided SRH the breakthrough, castling Tripathi. Nitish Rana (29, 20b, 3x4, 1x6) provided the innings the much-needed momentum. Rana hit two back-to-back boundaries off Rashid before launching him over long-on. Rashid sent back Gill before Vijay Shankar got rid of Rana.

The move to promote Russell did not pay dividends and it was left to an enterprising 58-run fifth-wicket stand between Dinesh Karthik (29, 14b, 2x4, 2x6) and Eoin Morgan (34, 23b, 3x4, 1x6) — the two plundered 52 off the last four overs — to give KKR a total of 163. Ferguson then took over.

214,2020/10/18,Indian Premier League 2020 | Dwayne Bravo could be out for a couple of weeks,"Fleming rues dropped catches.

Chennai Super Kings’ season of misery continued with Dwayne Bravo set to miss the next few matches after picking up an injury during the match against Delhi Capitals on Saturday.

Bravo’s absence forced CSK to use Ravindra Jadeja for the last over while defending 17 runs and Axar Patel hit the left-arm spinner for three sixes to seal it.

After the match, coach Stephen Fleming gave an update on Bravo’s injury.

“I think he has a right groin injury. It was serious enough for him not to come back and bowl. He could be out for a few days or maybe a couple of weeks,” said Fleming.

It is understood that the all-rounder has undergone a scan and the result will be known on Monday. In case, the injury is serious, Bravo could miss the remainder of the tournament since CSK’s last match is on November 1 against KXIP.

On the team’s sixth loss, the coach laid the blame squarely on the poor fielding. “We gave Dhawan a few lives. He was playing well, but we had opportunities to get him early and we didn’t take them,” said the former New Zealand captain.

“If we could have got him out early, the game might have been different.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lb8gll/article31799972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPO-CRI-RACISM-GHE7G7JDI4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-dwayne-bravo-could-be-out-for-a-couple-of-weeks/article32885352.ece

Additional DCP (South-East) Kumar Gyanesh said the accused, Gaurav Dutt, is from Brahampuri in Shahdara. The police said they received a complaint on Thursday from one Mukul Aggarwal, who told them that he first met the accused in 2015while working at a call centre.

219,2020/10/18,Journalist ‘attacked by police’ named in FIR,"He was ‘reporting’ on stir against alleged rape and murder of a teenage Dalit girl

Delhi Police on Saturday charged a journalist and nine others of criminal conspiracy for allegedly protesting outside Model Town police station on Friday. Six of the 10 accused are students.

The protest was staged by students, activists and locals of Gurmandi demanding lodging of an FIR into the alleged rape and murder of a teenage Dalit girl — a domestic helper who was found dead at her employer’s house in Model Town.

The police have registered an FIR under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 3 of the Epidemic Act.

The police alleged that over 15-20 men and women had gathered outside the police station and were not wearing masks or maintaining social distance. They also allegedly refused to leave even after being told to disperse. The police had detained 10 persons, including The Caravan magazine’s journalist Ahan Penkar.

In a statement, The Caravan said that Mr. Penkar was reporting when Assistant Commissioner of Police Ajay Kumar “kicked and slapped” him at the police station.

“Mr. Penkar had repeatedly told the police that he was a journalist and prominently displayed his press card,” the statement read.

The magazine also said the police forcibly took Mr. Penkar’s phone and deleted all videos and photos that he had recorded while reporting. “Mr. Penkar was detained for nearly four hours. In the assault, he suffered injuries on his nose, shoulder, back and ankle,” they added.

Responding to the allegations, the police said that Mr. Penkar was protesting and was detained along with the others, and later released.

“He later claimed he was a reporter and alleged misbehaviour by the police. The allegation made by Mr. Penkar is false and is only made with the intention of escalating the situation. The police action is bona fide,” they said.

The police said that the girl was reported dead on October 4 and her post-mortem was conducted on October 8, which revealed that the girl took her own life.

“No foul play has come in the investigation so far,” the police said, adding that the protest was staged “to put undue pressure on local police and tried to give the incident a different narrative”.

In August, three scribes from The Caravan were allegedly beaten, assaulted and sexually harassed in Gonda while reporting a story around the Delhi riots.

“The frequency with which The Caravan reporters are being targeted makes one wonder if there’s a calculated design behind such attacks,” said Vinod K. Jose, the executive editor of the publication.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/journalist-attacked-by-police-named-in-fir/article32883749.ece
220,2020/10/18,Delhi-NCR air quality likely to improve tomorrow,"Nearly 900 stubble burning fires in neighbouring States contribute to rising pollution in the Capital

The air quality of Delhi and Gurugram remained in the ‘poor’ category on Saturday, while that of Noida deteriorated to the ‘very poor’ level, according to the Central Pollution Control Board data.

The air quality of Delhi is expected to improve on Monday and Tuesday, as per System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).

The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi on Saturday was 287, and the values for Gurugram and Noida were 280 and 309, respectively, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin, which is an average of the past 24 hours. Delhi’s AQI on Friday was 239 (poor).

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘’good’’, 51 and 100 ‘’satisfactory’’, 101 and 200 ‘’moderate’’, 201 and 300 ‘’poor’’, 301 and 400 ‘’very poor’’, and 401 and 500 ‘’severe’’.

“The overall Delhi AQI is in the upper end of ‘poor’ category as of Saturday morning and likely to marginally deteriorate to lower end of ‘very poor’ later during the day mainly due to low surface wind. However, Wind speed is likely to slowly improve from Sunday, leading to relatively better dispersion in Delhi. But, AQI is predicted to stay in the higher-end of ‘poor’ to the lower end of ‘very poor’ category for Sunday, and likely to improve to ‘poor’ category by October 19 and further improvement is expected by October 20, but well within poor range,” SAFAR said in a statement.

The fire count due to stubble burning in Haryana, Punjab, and neighbouring border regions of Delhi was 882 on Friday, as per SAFAR. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to the PM2.5, a chief pollutant, levels in Delhi is estimated to be around 19% on Saturday.

The impact is likely to “increase significantly” by October 19, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said.

The wind direction is favourable for transport of pollutants due to stubble burning. Also, local wind speed is less and this leads to pollutants not getting dispersed easily and in turn negatively affects the air quality.

“The local wind speed is calm, almost nil during the night and during the day time it is 8-10 km/hr, which is also less. Dispersion of pollutants happens at this speed, but it is less. The local wind speed has to be above 15 km/hr and continue for a good amount of time to disperse pollutants properly,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD.

Meanwhile, no rain is expected in Delhi for the next seven days, which may result in higher dust pollution.

Officials said fire tenders sprinkled water in Wazirpur, Dwarka and Ohkla as part of measures to curb dust pollution. The Delhi Fire Services conducted the operation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6z3w2g/article32883661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17DELPRIYAAQI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-ncr-air-quality-likely-to-improve-tomorrow/article32883662.ece
221,2020/10/18,Temple fair starts under shadow of virus,"Experts warn against taking children to gatherings; four temple staff test positive

Despite the threat of COVID-19 still looming large, a usual pre-pandemic buzz marked the opening of the annual week-long Navratra Mela at Mata Sheetla Devi shrine here on Saturday.

Devotees, including children of all ages, from Haryana, Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan, and other States started to throng the temple early in the morning.

The visitors could be seen jostling in queues outside the premises with little regard for social distancing norms. The shrine board, however, distributed free masks to the devotees and sanitised their hands.

6 lakh devotees expected

Around six lakh devotees are expected to visit the shrine over the next week. The “mela” is expected to draw maximum crowd on Saptami (October 23) and Ashtami (October 24). The shrine was already open to the devotees with the Standard Operating Procedures, but the administration issued fresh directions on Friday regarding safety measures.

Around noon, an auto-driver from Delhi, Ranbir, accompanied by his family, including an infant, said he had come to visit the shrine since his wish for a male child was granted by “Maa”.

The 37-year-old said the infant could not be left at home as his hair needed to be donated to the temple.

“How long can we stay indoors?,” asked Ranbir, while taking out a bottle of sanitiser. While he claimed that the family took all precautions, none of the women or children were wearing masks.

Rohit, a mobile shop owner, travelled for around six hours from Punjab’s Bhatinda to reach the temple with his wife and newborn.

“We have come to express our gratitude to the deity for blessing us with a male child,” he said.

Temple officer Yogdutt Sharma told The Hindu that the deity was associated with the welfare of the children and, therefore, most of the devotees are visiting the shrine with their children.

He said the temple staff could not prevent anyone from entering the premises.

Preventive measures

He emphasised that the shrine board had taken a host of measures to ensure the safety of the visitors and the temple staff.

“The 106 staff members, including the policemen inside the temple, were tested for COVID-19 and four of them tested positive. Unlike the previous years, the visitors are told to leave the prasad at a designated place soon after they enter the premises,” said Mr. Dutt.

Gurugram Civil Surgeon Virender Yadav said the temple staff would be tested again during the mela.

Former Gurugram Bar Council president Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, visiting the temple, said the devotees were left disappointed as they were not being allowed to offer prasad inside the main temple.

“People travel long distances to reach the temple and are left disappointed when told not to carry prasad, chunnis and other offerings inside the main temple. The priests should be made to wear gloves and accept their offerings. It is a matter of faith,” said Mr. Bhardwaj, a former BJP district president.

Krishan Chugh, director and HOD of Paediatrics, Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram, cautioned that people, especially children, should avoid large gatherings such as melas.

“Parents should avoid taking children to melas and crowded places since they cannot wear masks, maintain social distancing and sanitise their hands all the time — the three basic tenets of protecting oneself and others from COVID-19. These children going back home will pass on the infection to their family members and others. Some of these children will develop multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome of childhood, which is a life-threatening form of COVID-19,” said Dr. Chugh.

A senior health department official also questioned the rationale behind allowing the mela, expressing apprehensions that such gatherings could lead to a spike in COVID-19 cases.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/43inxd/article32883632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE17GGN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/temple-fair-starts-under-shadow-of-virus/article32883633.ece
222,2020/10/18,"Civil Hospital augmented for COVID-19, but other patients left in the lurch","Many raise issues about access to ultrasound and CT scans; official says infrastructure upgraded to deal with virus will stay after pandemic

Panchu and his wife Lilawati are sitting under a tree inside the Sector 10 Civil Hospital premises on a hot Wednesday afternoon. The elderly couple is in distress and anxiously awaiting the woman’s blood test report.

An abdomen ache has been troubling 56-year-old Lilawati for nearly a week now.

But, she will have to wait for one more week before she can get an ultrasound scan, which is scheduled for October 25.

Panchu is a housekeeping employee in a private firm and earns ₹300-₹400 per day. He cannot afford the scan in a private hospital. “We have no choice, but to wait,” says Panchu.

Sitting nearby is Bablu, who is suffering from tuberculosis-like symptoms. “I came here on Tuesday, but there was a long queue at the blood sample collection counter and I got turned away. The samples are collected only till 11 a.m. and many people have to return every day,” says Bablu, who works at a moulding unit in Udyog Vihar Phase IV.

Once he gets the blood sample report, he will have to get a CT scan done at the old hospital building near the bus stand. “The CT scan is done in a building nearly 10 km from here. I will take leave tomorrow [Sunday] again and go there. It takes 3-4 days for a simple treatment. Poor people cannot afford to take so many leaves from work,” he says.

‘Five days for dengue report’

Nanak Yadav, a plumber, has been here since 6 a.m. — almost two hours before his appointment time. He wanted to ensure that he gets all the examinations done in a single visit.

“I have come to the hospital many times over the years. You never get all the prescribed medicines inside the hospital,” complains Mr. Yadav.

Another visitor, Darshan, says nothing has changed in civil hospitals: “I got my son Manoj’s dengue report only after five days.”

Dilwar Ali, who has come to the hospital for the third time for his wife’s treatment, says they live in Sector 65 and the private auto charges ₹150 one way.

Though the health crisis in the wake of COVID-19 has forced the government to augment health infrastructure in the district, many of the measures have been arranged on a temporary basis to deal with the situation at hand such as hiring of ambulances and lab technicians. But little seems to have changed for the poor patients thronging civil hospitals.

Principal Medical Officer at Civil Hospital Deepa Sindhu says nothing much has changed for the 100-bed hospital catering to a population of 15 lakh, as per the 2011 census. “In terms of new infrastructure, three RT-PCR labs have been set up. Besides COVID-19 tests, these can be used for H1N1 tests,” says Dr. Sindhu.

Despite the space crunch, hospital authorities were forced to cram in 45 more beds to deal with the rush. Soon, 25 more beds will be added for a separate Dengue ward.

Forced to share bed

The hospital records an average 500-700 deliveries per month, catering mostly to migrants. The expectant mothers and their attendants complain that 2-3 women are forced to share a bed inside the labour room.

Dr. Sindhu denies the allegations. “The shortage of employees has led to long waiting time for ultrasound scans with the priority being pregnant women. We hope to conduct the scans in two shifts soon to handle the rush. Also, we have created space for the CT scan machine to be shifted to this hospital. It will also be done,” she adds.

Administrative approval for a six-bed ICU building has been received and an up-gradation plan to add 100 more beds is in the pipeline. The government also plans to set up a 500-bed hospital at the site of the old Civil Hospital. All such projects may get delayed due to a financial crunch due to the lockdown and COVID-19 being a priority.

Civil Surgeon (Gurugram) Virender Yadav maintains that the health infrastructure had got an impetus with the appointments of doctors, lab technicians, data entry operators, and setting up of labs and addition of ICU beds.

“Many of these things will stay even after the pandemic is over. Though lab technicians are hired temporarily, the doctors are appointed regularly. The 44 doctors hired have been deployed in PHCs in Sohna and Pataudi. Similarly, 21 ICU beds and ten ventilators have been added to government hospitals,” says Mr. Yadav.

Though five ambulances have also been added to the fleet, the Nodal officer of the referral transport system, N.P. Singh, says that two of them have been brought from Nuh and another two were donated by the district administration. “We had hired a few private ambulances temporarily when home isolation was not allowed,” says Dr. Singh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/phic3y/article32883623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE17HOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/civil-hospital-augmented-for-covid-19-but-other-patients-left-in-the-lurch/article32883624.ece
223,2020/10/18,Outstation students lead again in DU admission rush,"Political science emerges as the most sought after course; colleges over-admitting students

Despite soaring cut-offs announced by Delhi University, admissions to over 49% of the merit-based undergraduate seats have already taken place in the first list itself.

As of Friday, 34,814 admissions had taken place against close to 70,000 undergraduate seats in the varsity.

Political science has emerged to be one of the most sought after courses with colleges over-admitting students. The cut-off for BA (Hons) Political Science at Miranda House and Ramjas College was 99% while at Hindu College it was 99.5%. All three colleges are likely to close admissions to the course in the first list itself. Principals of both North Campus and off-campus colleges said that similar to previous years, a large number of outstation students have taken admission this year.

Stay undeterred

Lady Shri Ram College principal Suman Sharma said, “We were thinking that the pandemic might have an effect on the number of students applying from outside Delhi. However that is not the case and the rush has been the usual.”

Stating that most of those who have taken admissions are outstation students, Anju Srivastava, Hindu College principal said, “There has definitely been a surge in applications from students outside of Delhi. Most of those who have taken admissions are outstation students. They must be having their own peer groups and seniors, and a streamlined process as we have not really received any query or mail regarding apprehensions, especially due to the pandemic. Despite high cut-offs, several of the courses closed after the first list.”

Ramjas College principal Manoj Khanna said, “There has been absolutely no change whatsoever from the previous years. The overall rush is the same with a substantial number of outstation students applying. Students from Karnataka, Bihar, Andhra Pradhesh and the North-East have taken admissions. The cut-off for political science was 99%. Despite that there have been 145 admissions against 78 seats. It is definitely one of the most popular courses. The other courses that saw a rush were Hindi and BA (Programme).”

Miranda House also saw students from Telangana and Kerala among other States taking admissions, said acting principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda.

Minor glitches

Aspirants from outside the city added that the online admission process has been mostly smooth barring a few glitches

Kamalkali Majumdar, an applicant from Kolkata said, “Not that there was a lack of information regarding the admissions but there were minor glitches. On the second day, a lot of us faced issues with the payment as the portal was not functioning properly. It was only later at night that the respective dashboards reflected that the payment was successful. Nodal officers were unreachable and emails unresponsive several times. We were mentally prepared for the process to take longer but it got done just in two days.”

“Overall, the process was smooth, however, I would have loved to experience the whole process first-hand and complete all the formalities along with other friends together,” said Ms. Majumdar, who has taken admission in a North Campus college.

Bibhasha Banerjee, another outstation student who has taken admission for the (BA) Sociology course in an off-campus college, said: “The online admission process had both advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage was that we did not have to travel all the way to the campuses during the pandemic. The online portal was a boon for those living outside Delhi. However, the disadvantage which the online process has is related to the ECA admissions as there will be no trials this year. This is unfair to all ECA aspirants as trials would help us showcase our talent properly.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnzm8a/article32883612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17DELPRIYADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/outstation-students-lead-again-in-du-admission-rush/article32883613.ece

The city on Saturday recorded 3,259 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, according to a health bulletin released by the government. This is the fifth consecutive day that the Capital has recorded over 3,000 new cases.

The death toll has reached 5,981 with 35 more fatalities reported in a single day, said the bulletin.

Of the total 3,27,718 cases, 2,98,853, people have recovered and there are now 22,884 active cases.

RT-PCR tests increase

A total of 55,715 COVID-19 tests were done in the past 24 hours, out of which 15,537 were RT-PCR tests.

This is the second day in a row where more than 15,000 RT-PCR tests have been conducted. Friday had seen the highest number of such tests till now with 15,660 RT-PCR tests.

The High Court had directed the Delhi government to increase the number of RT PCR tests, which is considered as the gold standard when it comes to COVID-19 testing.

Meanwhile, the number of active cases increased for the fifth consecutive day, and the people under home isolation for the fourth straight day.

But the number of people in hospitals slightly decreased on Saturday.

Out of the total 15,706 beds available for COVID-19 treatment in the city, 67.9% were vacant, as per government data. But 54.6% of the ICU beds with ventilators have been occupied and 55.6% of the ICU beds without ventilators are full.

The positivity rate (percentage of people testing positive for every 100 tests done) was 5.8%. The overall positivity rate till now is 8.3%.

225,2020/10/18,Diti’s conception,"Many hymns addressed to the Supreme Lord by deities such as Brahma, Rudra, Indra, and by sages such as the Sanatkumaras, Narada and so on are found in the Bhagavata Purana. These describe the Lord’s transcendent nature as well as His divine presence in every aspect of creation to stress His Paratva, Supremacy and His Saulabhya, accessibility by which man can realise Him as the prime indwelling force.

So, when the Devas approach Brahma for help to alleviate their fears caused by Diti’s conception, they praise him with the divine attributes exclusive to the Paramatma. It is to be noted that though Brahma is directly addressed in their hymn, the praise is clearly to the Paramatma who is the only Master and creator of all power holders, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. For actually, Brahma himself who is created by Him and is entrusted with the powers to create, only reflects His glory. The Devas pray that Brahma does something to save the world from the gloom that has enveloped it. Brahma then explains the entire background of the situation, going back to the visit of the Sanatkumaras to Vaikunta when out of divine Sankalpa many incidents happened. The gatekeepers of Vaikunta and the Lord’s personal attendants, Jaya and Vijaya, are cursed to be born as demons on earth and would have to seek Him through enmity.

When Diti conceives during the sandhya kala, it portends ill effects. This is the reason for the disturbances that take place at the time of their birth. Actually Diti repents for her impulsive act by which she now bears in her foetus a pair of wicked and unworthy sons of perverse nature. Kashyapa consoles her that they will be blessed and will die at the hands of the Lord and that one of her grandsons would be a great devotee, foretelling the advent of Prahlada.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/ditis-conception/article32887227.ece
226,2020/10/18,"Now, order food for delivery at Hyderabad airport","City startup launches kiosks at RGIA to deliver Hyderabad’s signature dishes at affordable rates

Desire to get the taste of a city as soon as one de-boards a plane might be a bit too unreasonable. But a food delivery startup from the city promises to cater to this irreverence too, and at reasonable prices.

Foody’s, the business venture by Naeem Khan, aims to bridge the gap between Hyderabad’s patent delicacies and the palates of its visitors, without the latter having to alter their packed itinerary. Claimed to be India’s first B2B2C (Business to Business to Customer) food delivery vertical, Foody’s has recently launched its delivery kiosks at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport here, to deliver the city’s signature cuisines, including its famed biryani.

By booking in advance through Foody’s, the customers may pick up their orders from the airport, upon arrival or at departure, from either of the two kiosks set up at the airport.

While an app is in the offing, the startup has already tied up with online travel booking agencies such as MakeMyTrip and GoIbibo, so that the customers may choose the delicacies while booking the tickets. Once the app is launched, they may book standalone orders too, six hours in advance, to receive the delivery at airport, Mr. Khan says.

In addition, customers may choose from Foody’s over-the-counter sales, too, at the airport. This will also help hungry passengers who choose to avoid the supremely expensive food outlets at the airport.

For a variety of cuisines catering to vegetarian and non-vegetarian connoisseurs, Mr. Khan has tied up with six restaurants in city — Shadab, Bawarchi, Rayalaseema Ruchulu, Ohri’s, Terrassen Cafe, and Euphoria. Based on the air passengers’ choice, newer restaurants and menus too will be added to the fare, he says.

While Mr. Khan, an advertising and marketing professional as well as food critic, was one among the pioneers in food delivery in Hyderabad, his business was uprooted with the arrival of Zomato and Swiggy which are on market acquisition spree.

“With this startup, we are banking on the logistic costs involved in food delivery. For any of these food aggregator apps, each order requires a delivery executive, whereas we ply trucks between the airport and the city to carry the orders in bulk at once,” Mr. Khan says. Besides, who would say no to a chicken biryani served at ₹250 inside the airport?

Based on the success here, he plans to expand the operations to Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru airports too.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/e4j1da/article32887928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy16Food,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/now-order-food-for-delivery-at-airport/article32887963.ece

228,2020/10/18,A choked Gurram Cheruvu leaves Old City flooded,"Extensive encroachments noted during inspection

There is no outflow channel for the Gurram Cheruvu that breached the bund and inundated Hafiz Baba Nagar, according to findings of Irrigation department officials who visited the lake in Balapur. All they found was a diminutive sluice through which not even one per cent of flood water could be drained.

While officials are not going on record saying that the lake was encroached, an FIR filed with the Balapur police and later transferred to the Chandrayangutta police station confirms that encroachment attempts had been reported last year.

The complaint was filed by Balapur mandal revenue officer against seven persons who were filling up the lake bed and levelling it using heavy machinery. The persons named in the FIR were Abdulla Saadi, Farooq Saadi, Ali Saadi, Umar Baom, Mohammed Bin Hyder, Hasham and Mustafa, some of them with criminal record.

Google Maps displays the filled up land on the other side of the bund, and rumours are afloat that the lake was breached on purpose to save the encroachment from flooding.

Satellite images from 2014 and 2020 show the extent of encroachment. | Photo Credit: By arrangement

Pictures don’t lie

The historical images from 2014 and 2017 show abundant water where the ground is levelled now, and even those as recent as November 2019 show some water on the other side.

“It is a clear encroachment, and doubts that the lake was deliberately breached are not without basis,” says Lubna Sarwat, State general secretary of Socialist Party (India), and well known activist for lakes.

Irrigation officials, however, have not confirmed that, and said the lake was already brimming with water owing to the spell of rain up to October 13. The officials have been on the ground trying to drain water through the sluice, with some success, despite vociferous objections from the dwellers downstream.

“We brought the water to safer levels, but before we could heave a sigh of relief, there was another bout of very heavy rain. The bund gave way under the pressure allowing the water to gush forth,” informed an official.

The Gurram Cheruvu is part of a network, which contains Burhan Khan Cheruvu, Balapur Pedda Cheruvu, Venkatapuram Cheruvu and somewhere in the line, the Gurramkani Cheruvu also known as Shukoor Lake.

From Gurram Cheruvu, the outflow channel meets the confluence of outflows from other lakes such as Palle Cheruvu, Salkam Cheruvu and Surram Cheruvu, which are all notified lakes of huge extents. “All these outflow channels meet to make a huge stream of water closer to Al Jubeil and Ghazi-e-Millat Colonies, which were drowned recently. The stream goes on to join Musi river,” explains Ms.Sarwat.

Owing to encroachments in the outflow channel of Balapur Pedda Cheruvu, which empties into Gurram Cheruvu, Nabil Colony is flooded too, she says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/m2sgu6/article32887915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20204,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/a-choked-gurram-cheruvu-leaves-old-city-flooded/article32887896.ece

230,2020/10/18,How lake encroachments and official inaction led to floods in Hyderabad,"Obstruction to water flow led to flooding in several colonies in last week’s rain spell

Nature is not elected government. Pandering to public demand is not its mandate, as could be seen from the repeated spells of urban wrecking which have become an expected phenomenon every now and then. Fall in line with utmost speed or perish, is the warning note being left behind every so often, but measures in that direction fall woefully short of the desired result.

Several reports and recommendations since the devastating floods in 2000 are lying unimplemented, and projects taken up by the government towards this direction are moving at snail’s pace, but the encroachment of water bodies and stormwater drains with impunity is proceeding at alarming pace. Activists point to the areas where very recent encroachments have obstructed the water flow, which led to inundation during the latest spate of floods.

“Between 2014, and 2020, encroachments have been made on lake beds at extraordinary pace. Gurram Cheruvu, Sunnam Cheruvu, Palle Cheruvu, APPA Cheruvu… you name it. Several areas are under water, and the government is doing precious little to salvage the situation. I have made some 200 representations to the government over various violations, but received no response to even one,” fumes activist and Telangana State General Secretary of Socialist Party (India) Lubna Sarwat.

M. Srinivas, city secretary of CPI(M), notes that APPA Cheruvu in Gaganpahad has been reduced to four acres from its original spread of 14 acres. “The development has been very recent. The area is occupied by industries and commercial establishments,” he says. Same is the fate of Palle Cheruvu in Mailardevpally and Gurram Cheruvu near Chandrayangutta.

Strangely, the APPA Cheruvu, which was the reason behind the flooding of Hyderabad-Bengaluru highway, is not even notified by the HMDA despite its discovery way back in 2014 by NGO Save Our Urban Lakes. Google’s historic imagery shows that the lake was encroached only recently between 2018 and 2020.

The Lake Protection Committee under HMDA has so far identified a total of 3,132 lakes in its purview, but issued preliminary notification for only about 2,000 of them. Final notification has been issued only for 224.

Ms.Sarwat claims that even in the notified lakes, the authorities have reduced the FTL limits to suit the fancies of a few influential encroachers, and condoned illegal constructions inside the limits. For instance, an FTL stone of the Saroornagar lake which has inundated area up to Dilsukhnagar, is found to be in the Singareni Officers’ Colony!

Besides encroachment of the full tank level (FTL) of lakes, the hydrological chain links — water channels connecting one lake with the other, and finally to Musi river — too have been tampered with and occupied, leading to calamitous consequences when it rains copiously. Town Planning is hardly a matter paid heed to, and indiscriminate permissions for layouts and illegal layouts have wrecked the natural topography of several areas.

Anant Maringanti, another climate activist and founder-executive director of Hyderabad Urban Labs, says, the Town Planning wing lacks teeth in Hyderabad, when compared to those in cities such as Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata. “The planning body here has no power at all. It has no money, no capacity to do anything. It doesn’t have manpower, nor regulatory authority,” he says.

Urban planners who should obtain information about the significance of any area’s natural terrain and the land use from the Revenue department, actually get only the information about cadastral survey of properties. Mr. Maringanti suggests establishment of a Land Commission through HMDA, which will pore deeply over the current status, and arrive at long lasting solutions for turning the urban agglomeration into a ‘sponge city’.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/j0zltt/article32887876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAH-HATIM-TALAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/eyes-wide-shut-to-rise-in-lake-encroachments/article32887879.ece
231,2020/10/18,Flood water drowns wedding glitter,"Gold, cash and clothes in almirah of Baba Nagar resident swept away

Hyacinth is entangled in the metal transom over a broken door. On the ledge, about eight feet above, hangs more hyacinth. Some of the streets too are flooded with it.

After the Gurram Cheruvu bund broke on Saturday night, flood waters brought with them the lake’s invasive vegetation to Baba Nagar, apart from devastation and despair.

It was late at night that residents realised the water level was rising perilously, and that they had only a few minutes to act. While those living in single-storey houses rushed to save themselves and their families to structures with more floors, others moved to safer neighbourhoods.

Mohammed Salman, a Baba Nagar–B Block resident who specialises in optical fibre trenching, says it was around 1.30 a.m. that the water level started to rise. Within a few minutes, he sought help of an acquaintance who evacuated his family in an SUV. Salman stands in his now ravaged home, shin-deep in muddy, cold water, with nothing but the clothes on his back. “Looks like we have to start all over. This has set us 10 years behind,” he says, and points to the place where a wall once stood. From here, one can see his TV set which was swept away in the torrent, and is now in the firm grip of a non-functioning electrical transformer.

Across the narrow road lives Mohammed Moinuddin. A couple of days ago, he was busy planning his sister’s wedding. But on Sunday morning, gold, clothes and cash, were swept away along with the almirah in which they were kept.

“Her wedding was scheduled to take place on November 12. Five tolas of gold, a lakh in cash, and some other articles were in the almirah. We don’t know where the water took it. As you can see, there is nothing here. The water was 10 feet high. At 2 am, I found shelter on the second floor of the neighbouring building,” says the 24-year-old who moved to Baba Nagar with family from Rein Bazaar 18 years ago.

The neighbourhood was to see another wedding, that of Ghousia Begum’s daughter. “We want to get her married in six months. While we didn’t buy a lot, but the few clothes that we had bought are soiled,” she says, adding the family of seven moved there three years ago. “The rent in Yakutpura was high, so we came here. Our landlords too have moved out,” she adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2gbi26/article32887862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18-FLOODWATERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/flood-water-drowns-wedding-glitter/article32887856.ece

Waist-deep water beneath Malakpet road underbridge hampered traffic, and areas on the eastern side were cut off from the rest of the city. Traffic came to a standstill on the Vijayawada highway for 5-km stretch, starting from Abdullahpurmet. The main road from Karmanghat up to Saroornagar was flooded with storm water arriving from Meerpet and Jillelaguda, posing grave danger to commuters. Several colonies in areas such as Nacharam, Mansurabad, Nagole, Karmanghat and other locations were inundated owing the flooding of nearby lakes. Water in Hussainsagar too exceeded full tank level, and is flowing through surplus nala towards Musi.

235,2020/10/18,Three IS operatives from Hyderabad among 15 convicted by NIA Special Court,"The orders were passed by Parveen Singh, Special Judge for NIA at Patiala House Court Complex, New Delhi

Three Islamic State operatives from Hyderabad were among 15 people who were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment by a Special Court for National Investigation Agency (NIA) cases, in New Delhi.

They were sentenced in an IS conspiracy in Delhi, registered by the agency in 2015.

Nafees Khan alias Fatima Khan alias Abu Zarrar of Madhapur, Mohammed Shariff Moinudeen from Tolichowki and Mohammed Obedullah of Saidabad were among the accused who were awarded prison terms along with a fine.

The orders were passed by Parveen Singh, Special Judge for NIA at Patiala House Court Complex, New Delhi, on October 16.

While Nafees Khan was sentenced to 10 years RI with a fine of ₹1.03 lakh, Moinudeen and Obedullah got five years RI each and a fine of ₹38,000.

The other 12 who were sentenced by the NIA Special Court are Mudabbir Mushtaq Sheikh, Abu Anas, Mufti Abdus Sami, Azhar Khan, Amzad Khan, Asif Ali, Mohd. Hussain, Syed Mujahid, Najmul Huda, Mohd. Obedullah, Md. Aleem, Md. Afzal, and Sohail Ahmad.

The case was registered by NIA, New Delhi, on September 12, 2015, under section 125 of Indian Penal Code and sections 18, 18B, 38 & 39 of UA(P) Act, 1967 and pertains to criminal conspiracy hatched by the ISIS to establish its base in India by recruiting Muslim youth for ISIS, a proscribed terrorist organization by using different social media platforms.

During the investigation, searches were conducted in various cities across the country and 19 accused were arrested. It was revealed that the accused persons had formed an organization by name Junood-ul-Khilafa-Fil-Hind (a group seeking to establish Caliphate in India and pledging allegiance to ISIS/ISIL) to recruit Muslim youth to work for ISIS and commit acts of terrorism in India at the behest of one Yusuf-Al-Hindi alias Shafi Armar alias Anjan Bhai, who was based in Syria and was purportedly the media chief of ISIS.

The case had a huge impact on the like-minded people who were likely to join ISIS, officials said.

“After the arrest the ISIS terrorists in this case, their activities were minimized and their other associates were identified and questioned to unravel their further plans,” they said.

Several ISIS sympathisers, who had gone to join ISIS, were intercepted at various locations in the Middle East and were deported back to India, they said.

The investigation conducted by the agency stopped the facilitation of the ISIS members in India as well as abroad and After completion of the investigation, NIA had filed charge-sheets against 16 accused persons in 2016-2017.

The investigators said that this case was first-of-its-kind in which an extensive terrorist conspiracy involving online radicalisation was hatched on cyberspace in the aftermath of the declaration of Islamic Caliphate by Abu-Baqar-Al-Bagdadi in 2014; and Yusuf Al Hindi alias Shafi Armar, based in Syria had slowly radicalized a number of accused and eventually motivated them towards violent jihad as propagated by ISIS.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1uxzcl/article32070726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-ISIS-Islamic-State,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/three-is-operatives-from-hyderabad-among-15-convicted-by-nia-special-court/article32885780.ece

240,2020/10/18,Rain ravages portions of 500-year-old Golconda Fort,"ASI officials conduct damage assessment of heritage landmark

Relentless rain over the past week in Hyderabad caused immense damage to the 500-year-old Golconda Fort. On Saturday, a team of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials inspected the damaged portions of the fort which have been cordoned off to prevent further damage.

“The steps and rocks of the kingsway, the wall near the Jagadambika temple, the rear wall and a structure near the second well have suffered damage. We are regulating the movement of tourists so that they don’t come to any harm. Luckily, visitors or tourists were not present at the locations where the damage took place,” said an ASI official at the site office.

The kingsway with wide steps is the path the Qutb Shahi royalty that ruled over the Golconda Kingdom used to ride up on horses to the top of the fortress known as Bala Hissar (high fortress). Nearly five metres of rock wall gave way, exposing soil on the path to the temple.

The ASI is the custodian of the inner fort which is built with Cyclopean masonry. A few days earlier, a portion of the Majnu Burj (bastion) had collapsed in rain in another part of the fort.

The Golconda Fort was built and modified by successive generations by Qutb Shahis who ruled for 160 years from the fort. It is considered an impregnable fortress with multiple rock curtains and has never been conquered, except by treachery.

“The rain has been unprecedented. But we cannot gloss over the fact that there is not enough budget with ASI for upkeep,” said Anuradha Reddy of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, adding: “The staff taking care of the fort is limited. The fort is a vast expanse of land and multiple structures which need constant monitoring. They also need highly trained technical personnel.”

The ASI comes under Ministry of Culture which has been asked to curtail budget to 60% as part of economic austerity measures by the Centre.

In the damaged portion of Majnu Burj bastion, an eight-metre long brass cannon is perched precariously as ASI officials try to get approvals for repair of the structure. “While the big rocks have been dislodged due to human intervention, I found that the rocks are still bonded by the original limestone masonry,” says Ms. Reddy.

“The ASI was building a toilet in the rear part of the temple. These kinds of unnecessary interventions should be stopped. We need to do a detailed survey of soil and rock movement so that further damage is limited,” said heritage activist and civil engineer Sajjad Shahid.

Outside the inner fort, the wall of the Katora Houz has also collapsed as water from the surrounding areas swirled around it on October 15.

242,2020/10/18,Hyderabad floods: Man survives after 4-hour struggle in water,"‘The decaying body of my brother was found 13 km away’

After struggling to keep himself from drowning in the October 13 torrent, Mohammed Abdul Taher Qureshi emerged in Falaknuma, four hours later, exhausted and with no clothes on his back.

“Somehow I caught hold of a wall and pulled myself out of the water. The clothes that I was wearing came off in the strong current. I saw a sack nearby and covered myself with it. I realised I was swept away from my house in Ali Nagar to somewhere in Falaknuma, three or four kilometres away. The realisation that I was struggling in the water for four hours dawned on me after I heard the fajr azaan around 5.15 a.m. During this time, I kept shouting for help. I later found out that Chandrayangutta Additional Inspector Prasad Varma tried to save me by pushing a pipe in my direction, but it slipped from my hands. I was stuck at one place and at another, somebody tried to rescue me,” Mr Qureshi, who belongs to the Arab tribe Al Gureshi, says.

He lifts his loose, grey trousers, and winces in pain, to show his shins. Crimson scratch marks criss-cross over green and purple bruises. His fatigued knees and thighs show signs of intense struggle.

“The decaying body of my brother, M.A. Quddus Qureshi, was found in L.B. Nagar, 13 km away. In fact, he tried to save me before being swept away. Around 1 a.m., we tried to move our family into his house which is across the road so that they would be safe. But the water took them away,” he says. Mr Qureshi’s son-in-law Mohammed Omar, a lawyer, interjects to explain that while the survivor’s house is single-storey, Quddus Qureshi’s house is a ground plus three structure.

While Mr Qureshi has buried five of his family members, three others — M.A. Wajid Qureshi, M.A. Wasay Qureshi and M.A. Wahab Qureshi — are still missing.

Among those who were killed was his daughter-in-law, Humera Farzana. His son M.A. Wasif Qureshi, is now in a West Asian country. Tuesday, when tragedy struck, was their wedding anniversary.

A retired Road Transport Corporation employee, Mr Qureshi explains that his son Wajid, who drowned, was working with a tech giant, even as he describes him as the ‘backbone’ of the family. He is now worried about his wife Nishat Fatima’s medical expenses.

243,2020/10/18,Fresh rain spell triggers panic in Hyderabad’s deluge-hit area,"Residents of Kabgir Nagar move the elderly, children to govt. school, relatives’ homes

Fearful residents of Kabgir Nagar near Al Jubail Colony moved to higher grounds once again on Saturday evening following a 45-minute spell of heavy rainfall in the area. “Water and muck is still there on the streets. We are afraid that the water level will rise again. That’s why we moved older people and children to the nearby government school and to the homes of our relatives,” said Muhammad Iqbal, a resident of the area.

Kabgir Nagar was one of the worst affected areas in the October 15 flooding when the water from the sewage channel overflowed and marooned the colony. “With my six-month-old granddaughter in arms, I ran to the neighbour’s house at 3 a.m. and climbed up a wooden ladder and stayed on their terrace till 7 a.m.,” says Gulam Yazdani, a state government employee.

The residents narrated a terrifying tale about how the water made bubbling sounds under the doors as they slept, only to be woken up by the loud cries of ‘pani aaya, pani aaya’ that forced them to make a quick escape between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. in pitch darkness. Most residents escaped with their clothes and cellphones. One of them, Ghousia Begum, managed to carry her four goats to the terrace and save them.

The low-income colony where a majority of the residents are tenants pay ₹4,000-4,500 as rent shared horror stories about their escape from the muddy water that gushed into their homes, destroying everything in its wake. The maze of streets are lined with furniture, bags of rice spoilt by water, fans, TVs, refrigerators and the foul odour of clothes drying for four days and dark muck littered with assorted plastic waste.

“We don’t have anything left. We have not changed clothes for the past four days. People are helping us with food and water. But we cannot live on charity forever,” says Muhammad Asif, a bus driver, pointing to shoulder high water mark inside the house. His elder son rushes inside and fetches a brownish wet pile. “These are my books. Now what am I going to study,” asks Muhammad Owais, an intermediate student of Falaknuma Junior College. The family survived by moving to the tin terrace of a neighbour’s house at 2 a.m. and staying put there till 7 a.m. when they moved to the railway track on higher ground with the help of other residents.

The destruction is not limited to household goods and articles, livelihoods have also been wrecked as the water tossed and shattered autorickshaws and small cargo vehicles parked by their owners in the area. One car floated in the water and crashed into a wall creating a gaping hole. One of the residents, Muhammad Ayub, lost even the shuttering equipment that he used to keep at his home.

“I was scared when the water rose quickly. I ran with my parents to the terrace of the neighbour’s house. It was completely dark and we walked with just the light of the cellphone torch,” said Salma, a class VI student of St Nizam High School who also lost all her books in the flooding.

“The water was waist high by the time we walked out and moved to my mother’s house on this street (a distance of 100 metres), it had already reached shoulder height. I was scared for my eight-year-old daughter,” recalled Fatima Begum who survived the ordeal along with her family of four.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/53rssm/article32883736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18RAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fresh-rain-spell-triggers-panic-in-hyderabads-deluge-hit-area/article32883724.ece
244,2020/10/18,More than dozen whales die after getting stranded on New Zealand beach,"Rescuers and volunteers worked all day on Saturday to refloat about 25 of the animals

More than a dozen whales have died in New Zealand after becoming stranded on the country's North Island, the Department of Conservation said on Sunday.

Rescuers and volunteers worked all day on Saturday to refloat about 25 of the animals, part of a pod of about 40 to 50 pilot whales who got stranded earlier that day on a beach in the Coromandel Peninsula.

Five dead pilot whales were discovered late on Saturday night at a site thought to be the original stranding location, the department said.

“Although the high tide at about 9 p.m. on Saturday night had allowed the stranded whales to be refloated, members of the pod restranded this morning including several on rocky outcrops at the bay,” the Department said in a statement on its Facebook account.

“Sadly, about dozen have died after restranding on the rocks this morning. However, we are encouraged by the fact the majority of the stranded whales have re-joined the pod this morning and have been chaperoned out to deep water.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/b8nrw7/article32885936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWZEALAND-WHALES,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/more-than-dozen-whales-die-after-getting-stranded-on-new-zealand-beach/article32885937.ece
245,2020/10/18,Pakistan foils attempt to smuggle endangered falcons,"The houbara bustard is a desert bird whose meat is prized among Arab sheikhs as an aphrodisiac.

Pakistani authorities said Saturday they had foiled an attempt to smuggle dozens of endangered falcons worth more than one million dollars out of the country.

Wildlife traffickers catch falcons in Pakistan's mountainous north, often to sell them for lucrative profits in the Gulf region, where hunting with the birds is a popular sport.

Customs officials seized 75 falcons and a houbara bustard at locations around the southern port city of Karachi in what they called an “unprecedented” anti-smuggling operation.

“The birds are listed as rare and endangered species and their trade is strictly banned,” said senior customs officer Mohammad Saqif Saeed.

He did not identify the species of the birds but estimated their value to be around 200 million rupees (over $1 million) on the black market.

Authorities have arrested two suspects and plan to release the birds into the wild.

The houbara bustard is a desert bird whose meat is prized among Arab sheikhs as an aphrodisiac. Falcons are often used by wealthy hunting parties from the Gulf who travel to Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province every winter to catch and kill the houbara.

An earlier ban on the sport was overturned by Pakistan's top court.

Two hundred rare falcons were reportedly exported to Qatar from Pakistan earlier this year on special permission.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/4pd6tu/article32885453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0008TA7F9,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/pakistan-foils-attempt-to-smuggle-endangered-falcons/article32885455.ece
246,2020/10/18,"Metropolitan Joseph Mar Thoma, 89, passes away","The primate of the Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church was undergoing treatment for pancreas cancer at a private hospital in Thiruvalla.

Joseph Mar Thoma, 21st Mar Thoma Metropolitan and current primate of the Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church, died here early on Sunday. He was 89.

The metropolitan had been undergoing treatment for pancreas cancer at a private hospital in Thiruvalla and his condition deteriorated sharply over the last one week. He breathed his last around 2.40 a.m on Sunday. Suffragan Metropolitan Geevarghese Mar Theodosius and Sabha secretary Rev. K.G. Joseph were present at the hospital.

He was installed as Mar Thoma metropolitan on October 2, 2007 after the 20th Mar Thoma, Philipose Mar Chrysostom, had expressed his desire to transfer responsibilities of the church to his successor due to old age and deteriorating health

Born as P.T. Joseph to Alakunnathu T. Lukose and Mariamma couple in Maramon, Pathanamthitta, he was ordained as deacon of the Mar Thoma Church in June 1957, and priest later the same year . Having pursued his master degrees in Master of Divinity and Master of Sacred Theology from England, the metropolitan was later awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree by the Protestant Episcopal Seminary in Virginia, United States.

He was ordained as Ramban in January 1975 and was ordained and given the episcopal title of Joseph Mar Irenaeus a month later. He was designated as suffragan metropolitan on 15 March 1999, when Philipose Mar Chrysostom, the suffragan metropolitan, was designated as the officiating metropolitan.

PM conveys condolences

Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter to convey condolences, and shared a video clip of his remarks at the 90th birthday celebrations the metropolitan.

“His Grace the Most Rev. Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan was a remarkable personality who served humanity and worked hard to improve the lives the poor and downtrodden. He was blessed with abundance of empathy and humility. His noble ideals will always be remembered. RIP,” wrote the Prime Minister.

The mortal remains of the metropolitan will be kept for public viewing at the Dr. Alexander Mar Thoma Smaraka Auditorium in Thiruvalla from 8 a.m on Sunday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/m17rdg/article32885119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201018-WA0017jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/metropolitan-joseph-mar-thoma-89-passes-away/article32885101.ece
247,2020/10/18,Migrant workers volunteer to donate plasma,"Outcome of ‘Let’s Reach Out Kerala’ initiative

In a show of affection for their adopted home, 13 migrant workers from the district who have recovered from COVID-19 have volunteered to donate plasma for treatment of infected persons.

This was among the many outcomes of the second phase of the migrant-centric ‘Let’s Reach Out Kerala’ an initiative being run by Athithi Devo Bhava, a migrant welfare project of the district unit of the National Health Mission (NHM) in association with the Centre for Livelihoods and Social Innovation of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, from the IMA House here.

The control room set up as part of the initiative encourages COVID-19 patients who turned negative for plasma pooling. “We can receive plasma only from symptomatic patients who have recovered and have so far contacted 56 such migrant workers. Some of them have agreed to look into potential donation once they feel fully fit, which is quite understandable,” said Akhil Xavier Manuel, nodal officer, Athithi Devo Bhava.

Meanwhile, the district committee of the DYFI is also running a campaign for mobilising plasma donors, having already arranged 17 donors since October 9 when a State-wide campaign was launched.

“We are in the process of compiling a list of potential donors at the grassroots-level committees to keep the campaign running. All such potential donors are approached, and those expressing reservations about plasma donation are being given counselling to allay their apprehensions,” said A.A.

248,2020/10/18,Internal exams go digital at Mahatma Gandhi University,"It replaces traditional method of writing exams under supervision of teachers

The internal evaluation of students in affiliated colleges under Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU) has gone online in view of the pandemic crisis.

The new system replaces the traditional method of writing internal exams under the supervision of teachers. Several colleges have started offering the internal exam component as part of the continuous evaluation of students through online platforms. The digital evaluation has given a novel experience to both teachers and students.

Faculty members say that around an hour is given for an internal exam. The time slot will be informed in advance. Students have to log in to the online platform and finish writing the answers within the specified time. “For those facing Internet glitches or connectivity issues, additional time will be given based on request,” they informed.

Students are relieved, as they need not go to the college to write the exam. “The online mode has turned beneficial, as we can sit in the comfort of our homes and appear for the exam,” they said.

According to teachers, the possibility of students referring to learning materials cannot be ruled out. “But it is done in the belief that students would not resort to such attempts. We have no other option amid the worsening pandemic crisis but to complete the internal exams through online platforms. Otherwise, the semester sessions will be stretched further,” they said.

Meanwhile, the university authorities said that all affiliated colleges could go ahead with the online internal exams in view of the COVID-19 situation. B. Keralavarma, Syndicate member and convener of its examination sub-committee, said institutions need not wait for official nod from the varsity for starting online internal exams. “We have learnt that some colleges have not yet started the process. To clear the air, we will soon issue a directive permitting the online mode for conducting internal exams,” he added.

The authorities pointed out that internal exam was only a component, as assignments submitted by students were also taken into account while making their overall internal assessment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/internal-exams-go-digital-at-mahatma-gandhi-university/article32884410.ece
249,2020/10/18,Rescheduling of exams brings cheer to students,"It will benefit those who missed MGU final semester exams on March 16 and 18

Students who missed their final semester exams conducted by Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU) following COVID-19 restrictions on March 16 and 18 have something to cheer about.

The varsity has announced that the exams will be held again for those who have registered for the exams and could not write them owing to the pandemic crisis. According to the university, around 600 students of the final semester undergraduate courses will get the benefits of the decision.

The university had conducted exams scheduled for March 16 and 18, as there were no restrictions then.

However, many students could not make it, as several places had started reporting spike in cases. Students who were at their home towns at this point could not make it owing to travel restrictions and fear of the pandemic spread.

The university authorities said the number of students getting enrolled in its affiliated colleges from districts outside the varsity’s geographical jurisdiction had gone up owing to the centralised allotment process for admission to various undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The students were not able to travel all the way from their homes to attend the examinations held on March 16 and 18.

250,2020/10/18,MDMA case: police after more youths and a foreigner,"Seizure of 21 grams of MDMA from a rented place at Edappally

The City police are looking at the potential involvement of another foreigner in the backdrop of the seizure of 21 grams of MDMA from a rented room at Edappally in March.

The police have so far arrested eight persons in this connection, including a Nigerian who allegedly sold the drug to youngsters.

“The Nigerian has confessed to the role of another foreigner, probably of African descent, in Bengaluru from whom he claimed to have bought the drug. We are pursuing that lead as well,” said an investigation officer associated with the inquiry. The Nigerian has a similar case involving LSD in Goa.

The police are also on the hunt for four more youngsters who were suspected to be part of the gang involved in drug trade. “As of now, those four along with the foreign suspect remain the only remaining accused in the case. We have been able to nab the ones who supplied the drug, transported it and its potential sellers,” the officer said.

All the suspects are college students, and they also targeted youngsters of their age as potential clients. The four youngsters who remain to be nabbed were suspected to be part of an eight-member gang of which other four — Muhammed Yasin, 20, of Koovappady; Jophin Varghese, 19, of Palarivattom; Aftab Liyaqat, 20, of Edathala, and Shifas, 20, of Aluva — had already been arrested.

The gang had taken a room adjoining the building from which Ahammad Yasin and Muhammad Shahad, youngsters from Aluva, were arrested with MDMA, triggering the chain of events. The gang had absconded as soon as the youngsters were arrested.

“Many of these youngsters were also suspected to be drug users as well, and the sale in part was probably for funding their own consumption, besides for making quick bucks. One of the accused was in a de-addiction centre till a week before his arrest,” said sources.

The drug was sourced from Bengaluru by Ahammad Yasin and Muhammad Shahad at ₹40,000, which was allegedly paid for by Shifas and brought here

The duo met their friend Muhammed Riyas, also from Aluva, in Bengaluru, who was a student there and stayed in his room. Shifas then transferred the money online to Shahad’s account who in turn transferred it to the account of Riyas’s roommate.

Later, they withdrew the money using the latter’s ATM card and bought the drugs before returning to the city where they were arrested a couple of days later. Riyas surrendered before court on October 7. It was his custodial interrogation that led to the arrest of the Nigerian.

District Police Chief (Kochi City) Vijay Sakhare had formed a team under Thrikkakara Assistant Commissioner K.M. Gigimon to probe the case. A team led by Inspector A. Ananthalal, Sub Inspectors Bibin and Josy, and Assistant Sub Inspectors Anil Kumar and Madhu made the arrest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mdma-case-police-after-more-youths-and-a-foreigner/article32884398.ece
251,2020/10/18,Pact on collaborative initiative for ventilators,"Cost-effective machines to be made

Jyothi Engineering College under the Thrissur Arch Diocese and IndVentr, a consortium of three start-ups, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaborate in research and innovation for manufacturing cost-effective ventilators to fight the challenge posed by shortage of ventilators in the wake of COVID-19.

IndVentr, a consortium of three start-ups — Sinergia Media Labs and Ionics 3DP based in Kochi, and Aruvii based in Singapore — and Prana Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation which grew out of biomedical engineering efforts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital have been working on low-cost emergency ventilators and multiplexing systems to cater to the challenges of the fast-evolving situation.

iSave, an innovative and frugal ventilator sharing platform developed by Prana Foundation facilitates ventilation of two subjects simultaneously, the validation of which was recently published in Science Translational Medicine. Priced at ₹20,000, it can quickly scale up the ventilator infrastructure around the world, which is now under severe stress.

They have also completed the functional prototypes of INADVENT-100, which is a time-tested BVM-based manual emergency resuscitator, which is being automated with added features and will be priced in the region of ₹50,000 to ₹60,000.

INADVENT-200, a more advanced and feature-rich ventilator with pneumatic design and priced at ₹1.50 lakh, will be the costliest of the three solutions. This will offer 90% of the functionalities of the far costlier existing ventilators in the market but at 10% the cost. It will have far less components unlike its market compatriots and hence will be much less complicated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pact-on-collaborative-initiative-for-ventilators/article32884389.ece
252,2020/10/18,Milma to push paddy cultivation,"Initiative under Subhiksha Keralam to achieve self-sufficiency in food production

The Ernakulam Regional Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union has decided to encourage paddy cultivation in a big way, as it joins the Subhiksha Keralam programme to achieve self-sufficiency in food production.

To mark the launch of efforts to take over fallow land and bring it under rice cultivation, the Poothrikka Primary Cooperative Milk Producers Union has taken up cultivation of 2.5 acres of paddy field at the Vallikkatuthazham paddy collective, said John Theruvath, chairman of the Ernakulam region.

He said that more primary milk cooperatives were interested in taking up rice cultivation to augment income and to ensure that they have something to fall back on, as the dairy sector went through ups and downs during the pandemic. He added that the Milma union would include a substantial allocation in its annual budget to encourage rice cultivation by primary cooperatives.

M. Prabhakaran, president of the primary milk cooperative at Poothrikka, was among those who were present when the 2.5-acre field was sown.

Mr. John said the Ernakulam regional cooperative, spread over Thrissur, Ernakulam, Kottayam and Idukki districts, had around 930 primary cooperatives, and that encouraging cooperatives would help in bringing substantial areas now lying fallow under rice and vegetable cultivation.

Meanwhile, the cooperative is implementing an insurance scheme in collaboration with Oriental Insurance Company for dairy farmers. The insurance is for protection of farmers afflicted by the pandemic. The ‘Covid Rakshak’ insurance scheme is for those aged between 18 and 65 years and provides a coverage ranging between ₹50,000 and ₹2.5 lakh in case a dairy farmer is down with infection for three days.

Milk procurement by the regional cooperative has kept steady after Onam. The daily procurement is to the tune of 3.35 lakh per day in the current week, and sales have touched 3.55 lakh litres per day, Mr. John added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/milma-to-push-paddy-cultivation/article32884375.ece

254,2020/10/18,Shoddy state of NH Bypass draws motorists’ ire,"Commuters to move consumer forum against NHAI citing deficient service

With the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) under fire for shoddy upkeep of the 16-km-long Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass and repeated complaints from different quarters remaining unaddressed, regular commuters are planning to approach consumer forum to hold the agency, which collects hefty toll, accountable by citing poor service.

The condition of almost all bridges on the bypass is deplorable, with motorists having to endure a bouncy ride at their entry and exit points and over the shoddily-maintained expansion joints of bridges. The Kumbalam Bridge is among the worst maintained, with undulations galore even away from expansion joints. Moreover, potholes dot the road beyond the bridge on the Aroor side and at many other points on the bypass.

The NHAI is also reluctant to repair potholed portions in the vicinity of the flyovers that are nearing completion at Vyttila and Kundannur. The agency’s common refrain is that the two sites were handed over to the PWD (NH Wing) three years ago for constructing flyovers, and that the onus is on the PWD to repair them. After negotiating through the two ill-maintained junctions and getting caught in traffic snarls here, enraged motorists often pick quarrel with NHAI personnel who man the Kumbalam toll plaza when they have to pay hefty toll (₹40 for a single trip for cars and much higher for bigger vehicles). They encounter snarls at the toll plaza too, as there are not enough toll booths to cater for burgeoning number of vehicles. There is also confusion among motorists over which lane to enter, since those entering the FASTag lane by mistake are forced to cough up double the toll rate.

The NHAI has also not installed street lights and adequate number of reflectors on the busy stretch, despite it catering for intra-district, inter-district and inter-State traffic. This often causes accidents, mainly involving pedestrians and two-wheeler riders. Interestingly, few people use foot overbridges at five points on the bypass, citing their steep gradient and lack of lights at night. Adding to their misery, pedestrian lines beneath them have been erased. There are no proper sign boards either, warning of pedestrian-dense zones and impending U-turns.

“The NHAI imposing hefty toll on motorists [and further increasing the rate each year] is nothing but ‘highway robbery’,” said D.B. Binu, lawyer and consumer rights activist, who is a regular commuter in the NH corridor. He had filed a case challenging the toll collection, on the basis of data gathered through an RTI query. “From the condition of the NH Bypass and junctions on the stretch, it appears that the NHAI is exercising power [to collect toll] without responsibility. Litigants had approached courts across the country, citing that the agency/firms deputed by the agency collected toll which was many times the investment on NH corridors. The NHAI must at least take steps to avoid the agonising wait at the Kumbalam toll plaza,” he said.

A senior NHAI official said efforts made to add more toll booths at the plaza did not materialise due to high cost of land acquisition. “As for potholes and waterlogging on service roads, an expert has been engaged to submit a report on the need for drains in areas without them and covering existing drains with slabs,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ziaiwj/article32884303.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-KI-TOLL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/shoddy-state-of-nh-bypass-draws-motorists-ire/article32884305.ece

256,2020/10/18,MVD to act tough on users of faulty number plates,"Department collected a total of ₹83 lakh as fine from erring motorists in 3,288 cases in September

Faced with youth and others zooming past in new-generation motorbikes and cars bearing illegible, hidden, or non-existent registration number plates, and not bothering to stop when requested, the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) will go into overdrive in the coming weeks to rein them in.

Number plate is the basic identity of a vessel, which also enables detection of offences. A total of ₹83 lakh was collected as fine in September from motorists, in 3,288 cases. This was for offences ranging from improper number plates and not wearing helmets, to unauthorised alteration of different vehicles, said Shaji Madhavan, Enforcement RTO.

The cases registered would have been much more but for COVID-19 restrictions. Subsequently, four interceptor vans of the MVD allotted to Ernakulam district and other enforcement units were not able to function optimally, it is learnt.

“As per rules, the automobile dealer must affix high-security registration number plates having dedicated serial number and hologram, which was made mandatory in April 2019, on each vehicle. A special riveting process is adopted for this, to ensure that it is tamper-proof. A rivet remover is needed to remove it. The number is also engraved on the windshield glass, in case of cars and bigger vehicles. Of late, many two-wheeler riders either remove the mud guard which bears the number plate or bend the plate in sharp angles, hampering their visibility,” Mr. Madhavan said.

There are also instances of motorists affixing fancy number plates to hoodwink law enforcers and give them the slip. While most other vehicle owners are adhering better to the rule, two-wheeler riders and goods carriers are the worst rule violators. Lorries from other States are especially at fault, even installing rear under guard in a manner covering a view of their number plate.

There is no excuse for two-wheelers to shun mandatory number plates, since its cost and that of helmet are covered in the vehicle cost and must be supplied by the dealer concerned, Mr. Madhavan said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/y3ign2/article32884270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201017-WA0008-new,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mvd-to-act-tough-on-users-of-faulty-number-plates/article32884271.ece
257,2020/10/18,Infection control measures stepped up as more health workers test positive,"Around 700 health workers have been infected in Ernakulam so far

A total of 700 health workers have been infected in the district so far, in a nearly six-fold jump from mid-August when 110 health workers had cumulatively tested positive for the coronavirus.

According to health officials and infection control officers at hospitals in the district, the extent of the spread of the virus in the community has made it nearly impossible to ascertain if health workers have contracted the infection from within the health-care facility or outside.

Attempts, however, have been made to strengthen infection control measures both in government and private facilities. “Training for health workers on use of personal protective equipment is being provided. The administration liaises with nodal officers at private hospitals every week to monitor their functioning as well,” said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission.

Since pre-COVID-19 times, committees are in place at all government hospitals right from the primary health centre level to monitor infection control measures, said a doctor at the Muvattupuzha General Hospital. These committees are required to meet every week to assess hospital hygiene and practices to maintain it. But crowding and ensuring distancing continue to remain a problem, she added.

Dr. Sonya Joy, consultant microbiologist and infection control officer at Aster Medcity, said that infection control measures, like appropriate PPE use and hygiene, were seemingly simple, but could be difficult to enforce among a large group of people. CCTV footage is being observed to ensure health workers were wearing appropriate PPE at all times, and restrictions are in place to make sure workers do not gather for meals. “The chances of getting the infection could be higher outside hospitals considering precautions are strict inside a health facility,” she said.

It is likely that health workers are contracting the infection from outside hospitals, said Dr. Numpeli.

Dr. Neethu Susan Phillip who heads infection control at Rajagiri Hospital said practices like taking patient history, cough etiquette, and hand hygiene had assumed greater significance. With health workers, being careful while doffing contaminated PPE kits is crucial, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/pq37ji/article31181275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29SMKERALANEW5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/infection-control-measures-stepped-up-as-more-health-workers-test-positive/article32884240.ece

259,2020/10/18,Local CPI(M) leader alleges attack,"Police register attempt to murder case

The Palarivattom police have registered an attempt to murder case in an incident in which a local CPI(M) leader was attacked allegedly by three motorcycle-borne youngsters wearing masks on Saturday around 5.30 a.m.

A.N. Santhosh, Vyttila area committee member of the party and president of Vennala Service Cooperative Society, lodged a petition that he came under attack during his morning walk along the Padivattom-Arkkakkadavu Road. He escaped unhurt.

Mr. Santhosh claimed that he had noticed the assailants before the incident. “I was curious to see three youngsters on a motorcycle so early in the day, but did not give it much thought and continued my walk,” he said.

He said one of the two pillion riders later rushed at him and swung a long knife, which he evaded. He then removed his mask and tried to reveal his identity under the impression that they were attacking him by mistake. “But the person did not stop and gave me a chase when I ran for my life. I was saved when the driver of a Corporation lorry out to collect waste stopped when I jumped in front of the vehicle. Seeing this, the assailants sped away and the driver dropped me near Edappally church,” said Mr. Santhosh.

He said he had recently written a letter to the Chief Minister demanding action against the real estate mafia in the wake of a recent land deal controversy in Kochi. Palarivattom sub inspector Liju Joseph said a probe was on.

In a release, the CPI(M) Vyttila area committee alleged that the attack on Mr. Santhosh was among the incidents targeting anyone speaking out against the land mafia. District Congress Committee general secretary M.B. Muraleedharan urged the police to bring out the truth behind the petition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/local-cpim-leader-alleges-attack/article32884187.ece
260,2020/10/18,Koothattukulam municipality getting rid of three-decade-old legacy waste,"Civic body to shift to system of converting biodegradable waste into bio-manure

After getting rid of nearly all the legacy waste dumped in its yard over the last three decades, the Koothattukulam municipality along the eastern border of the district is set to shift to a waste disposal system converting biodegradable waste into bio-manure by the end of the year.

The municipality had roped in a Kattapana-based ex-servicemen charitable society approved by the Suchitwa Mission for the disposal of the piled up waste. The agency, which was selected through e-tender for the ₹25 lakh-project, started the work a week back.

While the sorting of waste and loading into lorries were done during the daytime, the transportation was restricted to the night to avoid inconveniencing the public.

“Already about 85% of the waste has been removed using the contracted amount. A few more lakhs would be needed to clear the nearly 70 cents of the dumping yard, which will be done soon,” said municipal chairman Joy Abraham.

He said the municipality had maintained photographic evidence of every truckload of waste transported out of the dumping yard to ensure that there were no irregularities and that the agency worked at optimum capacity.

Thumboormuzhi model

Once the dumping yard is cleared, the municipality plans to adopt an aerobic composting technique popularly known as the ‘Thumboormuzhi model’ for converting the waste into bio-manure, the sale of which is expected to bring in revenue.

“We are about to distribute three separate bins to shops and establishments in the municipality for segregated collection of biodegradable, non-biodegradable and plastic waste,” said Mr. Abraham.

Green army

Health standing committee chairman Sunny Kuriakose said a green army for waste collection had been formed. However, the waste collection will be largely restricted to traders and only a limited number of households from the town area will be covered.

Mr. Abraham said that since the municipality was a largely agrarian society, majority of the households had the capacity to treat waste at source. The municipality would help set up compost pits or bio-bins, wherever needed.

In the wake of the pandemic, the municipality also plans to set up a plastic shredding unit along with an incinerator to deal with the increasingly large volume of used masks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/koothattukulam-municipality-getting-rid-of-three-decade-old-legacy-waste/article32884184.ece
261,2020/10/18,"Coronavirus | India past COVID-19 peak, says Science Ministry panel","Study commissioned by the Department of Science and Technology predicts “minimal” cases by February, if festival spikes are avoided.

India passed its COVID-19 peak in September and, if current trends continue, there will be “minimal cases” by February.

These are the findings of a modelling study by a seven-member expert panel on the future course of the pandemic, which was commissioned by the Department of Science and Technology.

According to the study, India’s COVID burden is expected to be capped at 106 lakh symptomatic infections by early next year, with less than 50,000 active cases from December. There are 74 lakh confirmed cases as of Sunday, of which about 7,80,000 are active infections.

This, however, is premised on no spikes triggered by festivals or mutations in the virus aiding its spread in winter.

Scientists associated with the study said there would be no gains from lockdowns or from measures harsher than what are in place today. A complete shutdown should be considered only at sub district levels if there’s a spike that threatens local healthcare capacity, they said.

Coronavirus | Finance Ministry says COVID-19 past peak, predicts growth

The modelling study called the “COVID-19 India National Supermodel” is the result of analysis by an expert committee consisting of mathematicians and epidemiologists. There have been several mathematical model-based projections of the pandemic by various groups within India and internationally. However, experts — and even government officials — have publicly warned they were projections meant to guide policy and not always to be taken literally.

The ICMR, in its latest sero-survey in August, had estimated that 7% of the adult population had been exposed to the virus.

The modelling committee, however, said this was an under-estimate. Citing the smaller sero-survey conducted in several cities that showed antibody prevalence between 22% to 30%, the panel said that as of August, about 14% of the population was likely infected. Extrapolating from here, nearly 30% of the country had been exposed to the virus as of Sunday, they reckon.

Comment | Imperatives after India’s September virus peak

“The pandemic has peaked but this isn’t reason for complacence as this nice downward trend will continue only if we continue with protective measures,” said Prof. M. Vidyasagar of the IIT, Hyderabad, and chairman of the committee.

A possible reason for India already reaching its peak could be the varying susceptibility of different people to the virus, said Lt. Gen. Madhuri Kanitkar, physician and a member of the committee.

“Some people infected by the virus develop the disease and some only develop antibodies. Normally you’d expect that 60%-70% of the population would need to be infected for herd immunity. However, the “attack rate” (rate of new cases) of the virus seems to have slowed down,” Lt. Gen. Kanitkar said at a public webinar to publicise the results of the study.

Coronavirus | India has been able to ‘distribute the curve’ of COVID-19 infection due to ‘very effective lockdown’: ICMR

A fuller explanation of the methods employed will be available in the peer-reviewed Indian Journal of Medical Research in the coming week, said Prof. Vidyasagar. He added that the committee had relied on publicly available dataset and “integrated the best of similar models” available globally.

Had there been no lockdown India would have seen symptomatic active infections peak from 40-147 lakh by June and a lockdown beginning on April 1 or May would have seen a peak of 30-40 lakh by July, Prof Vidyasagar said.

“We would have had a peak 15 times greater (no lockdown) and completely overwhelmed our health systems and anywhere between 6-25+ lakh deaths, instead of the 1 lakh that we saw till September. The lockdown was necessary and came at the right time,” he added.

“The imposition of various safety protocols such as wearing masks, social distancing etc. together with a comprehensive lockdown, has allowed India to fare better than many other countries,” the committee said in press statement.

Coronavirus | September accounted for 41.53% of total cases in India

“The existing personal safety protocols need to continue in full measure. Otherwise we will see a sharp rise in infections. Avoiding congestion especially in closed spaces and special care of those above 65 years and children is even more significant. Persons with co-morbidities need to be extra cautious,” the statement said.

With dramatic declines expected in December and the government underlining that a vaccine would likely be available by March, Lt. Gen. Kanitkar added that a vaccine would still be useful particularly for healthcare workers and the old and those most vulnerable who've been “confined to homes and unable to move around more freely.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ijsv3o/article32836003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAHA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/no-fresh-lockdowns-recommended-at-local-level-government-appointed-panel-on-covid-19/article32886373.ece
262,2020/10/18,Coronavirus remains active on human skin for 9 hours: study,"The pathogen that causes the flu survives on human skin for about 1.8 hours by comparison

The coronavirus remains active on human skin for nine hours, Japanese researchers have found, in a discovery they said showed the need for frequent hand washing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pathogen that causes the flu survives on human skin for about 1.8 hours by comparison, said the study published this month in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal.

“The nine-hour survival of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus strain that causes Covid-19) on human skin may increase the risk of contact transmission in comparison with IAV (influenza A virus), thus accelerating the pandemic,” it said.

The research team tested skin collected from autopsy specimens, about one day after death.

Both the coronavirus and the flu virus are inactivated within 15 seconds by applying ethanol, which is used in hand sanitisers.

“The longer survival of SARS-CoV-2 on the skin increases contact-transmission risk; however, hand hygiene can reduce this risk,” the study said.

The Integrated Flood Warning Systems developed for Mumbai and Chennai to cater to the needs of coastal cities will be extended to Kolkata, Earth Sciences Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday.

Mr. Vardhan, who is also the Science and Technology Minister, said not only has the percentage of women contributing to science education at the school level increased significantly, but the percentage of women in government laboratories has also increased.

In order to further improve the situation, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) is increasingly boosting its interventions for the participation of women in S&T at multiple levels through various new schemes, Mr. Vardhan said.

“The Integrated Flood Warning Systems developed for Mumbai and Chennai are city-specific prediction systems to cater the needs of coastal cities which will be extended to Kolkata.

“For states like Assam and Bihar that have river-based floods, the Central Water Commission generates flood warning based on the rainfall forecast provided by IMD,” Mr. Vardhan said.

He was addressing the sixth episode of the Sunday Samvad.

264,2020/10/18,Calicut varsity seeks UGC nod for distance education courses,"Newly launched university yet to get recognition

Calicut University has sought the approval of the University Grants Commission (UGC) to run undergraduate and postgraduate courses under the distance education mode this academic year, as the newly launched Sree Narayana Guru Open University is yet to get recognition to do so. The procedure for admission, however, is expected to begin only by next month.

According to sources at the School of Distance Education at the university, this follows an unofficial direction from the State government. October 15 was the earlier deadline to file application with the UGC. In the meantime, the commission extended the date to October 31. Now, the university is expecting a clearance from the UGC, they said. There are 14 UG courses and 12 PG courses.

Though the government had gone ahead with its plans to stop all distance education programmes under the University of Kerala, Mahatma Gandhi University, Calicut University, and Kannur University and bring them all under the open university, the Kerala High Court intervened in the matter on a petition filed by parallel colleges and students. It was pointed out that the newly launched university was yet to get recognition from the UGC, and that the future of over a lakh students was at stake. Subsequently, the court asked the government to produce the approval under UGC regulations.

Parallel college owners and students had also pointed out that the government had barred other universities from running distance education programmes because it was not sure about students joining the open university. It was pointed out that though the project report of the university had mentioned that the functioning of the university was subject to UGC approval, it had been ignored.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/644gv6/article31903653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/new-campus-sougGHV6JEJ783jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/calicut-varsity-seeks-ugc-nod-for-distance-education-courses/article32884334.ece
265,2020/10/18,"24x7 service at Vadakara, Perambra veterinary clinics","Doctors, specialised surgeons to work in three shifts to attend to calls of farmers in livestock sector

The Department of Animal Husbandry has introduced 24x7 service at its two polyclinics in Kozhikode district.

The Vadakara and Perambra-based clinics will have sufficient number of veterinary doctors and specialised surgeons in three shifts to promptly attend to the calls of farmers in the livestock sector. Efforts are also under way to redeploy some of the experienced doctors from other veterinary hospitals to support the polyclinics.

According to officials, the two clinics will be able to cater to the rural entrepreneurs better and offer them doorstep support in case of emergency situations. Expansion of the existing labs and emergency care facilities will be considered in the next phase of development.

The polyclinics will function under the supervision of senior veterinary surgeons. The night shift from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. will be controlled by a veterinary surgeon appointed on contract basis. Complicated cases will be referred to the Vadakara centre, where more emergency care facilities and lab tests are available.

Officials say there are no other government veterinary hospitals in Kozhikode district that offer round-the-clock service. More such polyclinics are likely to be opened to cover more areas. There is also a suggestion to buy a pet ambulance. Till the polyclinics get their own vehicles, the service seekers will have to arrange the transportation of doctors for doorstep service.

Doctors now working with various veterinary hospitals in the district say the 24x7 service will be a relief for many farmers in the dairy sector. As most of the complicated cases related to calving take place during night hours, many have been struggling to get spot service of vets and related services, they point out.

The opening of the polyclinics has also brought cheer to hundreds of pet handlers.

At least 700 fishermen and women from five villages, including Olaikuda and Sangumal, in Rameswaram have planned to set up gruel centre (kanji thotti) near the Collectorate on Wednesday to draw the government’s attention to their long-pending demands.

Speaking to reporters, CITU (fishermen wing) district secretary M. Karunamoorthy and president E. Justin on Sunday said the fishing sector, particularly country boat fishermen, faced a bleak future and survival had become a big question for a majority of the community.

Although there were various factors, including the pandemic, responsible for the dire situation, the prime issue was official apathy and nonchalant attitude of the governments in redressal of their grievances.

Also, mechanised boats were using banned fish nets despite the tall claims of officials of the Fisheries Department. When the governments had categorically instructed that country boat fishermen alone shall venture into fishing within two to three nautical miles, mechanised boat fishermen violated the arrangement.

Hence, in order to draw the attention of the authorities to their grievances and seek redress, the fishermen collected contributions from people in front of churches on Sunday to set up the gruel centre. “We have no other alternative but to look for government support for our survival,” Mr. Karunamoorthy said.

Even if police arrested the fishermen, they would remain in prison along with their families. At least 700 to 1,000 members would assemble near the office of the Fisheries Department on Wednesday, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/pbehzg/article32887320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY19-GRUEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/fishermen-to-open-gruel-centre-near-collectorate/article32887321.ece

Large number of people from a church here resorted to a road blockade stir on Sunday.

The complaint was that some miscreants had damaged the cemetery situated on the Thatchanallur-Manumurtheeswaram Road, which belonged to the CSI Church.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that some miscreants had gained entry into the cemetery on Saturday night and damaged the cemetery and the compound wall. Out of the two entries, one was closed.

People suspect that the handiwork could be of some mischief mongers wanting to create unrest between two communities, a police officer said.

As the news spread about the damage to the cemetery in the early morning, people assembled near the CSI Church and shouted slogans and demanded arrest of the culprits.

The agitators said that at least 40 graves had been damaged and the miscreants had used crowbars to dismantle the structures there. Though the police assured to get the case solved, the people resorted to a road blockade on the Tirunelveli-Madurai stretch.

As a sequel, the police had to divert vehicles on the bypass for about an hour. Large posse of personnel were also deployed to ensure that there were no untoward incidents.

The Thatchanallur police have registered a case and ACP Satish Kumar said that special teams have been formed to nab the suspects.

Director General of Police J.K. Tripathy had recently suggested that all district police officers focus on attending petitions without delay. The station house officers should not delay in registering FIR if the complaint was found to be genuine.

In order to understand the issue (the complaint) better, the investigating officers have been told to visit the petitioner’s dwelling or the address mentioned in the complaint. “This will enable police officers to prevent crimes and also solve it speedily,” according to Mr. Tripathy.

Police are getting good response from different parts of the State to the initiative, Mr. Tripathy told The Hindu on Sunday.

Besides submitting petitions, the public can also contact through ‘Hello Police’ at 8300031100 in the district, Superintendent of Police E. Karthik has said.

The SP, who assumed office recently, says the public, especially women and senior citizens, can utilise ‘Hello Police’. The objective of the facility is to provide a safe and secure platform for the caller to share any information, which they can pass on to the police for swift and tangible action.

For instance, sand smuggling activity in a locality can be informed and the identity of the caller will be strictly confidential. Similarly, if there is any gambling activity going on in a specific area, the caller can give information and the police team will act swiftly.

Public, who visited police stations with a complaint, should be given FIR at the earliest. Any delay or failure to issue the FIR copy by the officer concerned will be viewed seriously and the public can inform such delays with ‘Hello Police.’

276,2020/10/18,Students need more NEET study material in Tamil,"Plea for full-fledged NEET training centres with dedicated staff

There is only one private publishing company’s quality study material available in Tamil language for those preparing to take National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) in the district, apart from the school textbooks. Teachers say this has put Tamil medium students of government and government-aided schools at a disadvantaged position, when compared to English medium students who can access several quality study materials.

A School Education department official says that out of the 77 government and government-aided Tamil medium students in the district, who attended the online NEET crash course during the COVID-19 pandemic, 24 have qualified in the examination. “We distributed Tamil study material consisting of two volumes each for Biology, Physics and Chemistry to government school heads during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were asked to lend the books to the students who were enrolled in the online NEET crash course,” he says.

However, some students were unable to have access to these books owing to restrictions in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, says S. Vennila Devi, district coordinator for government-sponsored NEET programme.

T. Prathap, a Tamil medium student of Kallar Reclamation School in Chekkanoorani, says he was able to have access to books only one month before the examination. “I could have prepared better had they been available from the beginning of the academic year,” he says.

However, it is a pity that Tamil study material is available from only one private publisher, says Vijintha, a Chemistry teacher of Government Higher Secondary School at Vellaiyampatti. ""Before these books were available, the teachers had a hard time translating the questions from English books,” she says

The State board textbooks do not have sufficient multiple choice questions that are similar to the questions asked in NEET, says Ms. Vennila Devi.

Hence, the government must take steps to bring in more number of superior NEET study materials in Tamil, so that Tamil medium students can perform better, says S. Murugan, district secretary of Tamil Nadu Graduate and Postgraduate Teachers Association. “The government has set up a proper training institute for civil services examination aspirants in Chennai. Similarly, it must set up full-fledged NEET training centres with a dedicated team of teachers in all the districts. This will help government and government-aided school students to prepare in a better way for the examination,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/students-need-more-neet-study-material-in-tamil/article32886998.ece

Yakshagana artist and freedom fighter Hiriyadka Gopal Rao, popularly known as ‘Maddale Mantrika’, a maestro in playing the maddale, a percussion instrument, passed away at his residence in Ontibetti near Hiriyadka in Udupi on Saturday. He was 100.

Mr. Gopal Rao was unwell for the last two days and he spoke to a few of his family members on Saturday morning. He passed away at around 9 p.m.

A Rajyotsava awardee, the veteran Yakshagana artist served in many melas and played maddale in the ballets of Kota Shivaram Karanth. He was also part of Kinnara Nritya and Mooka Nritya programmes of Karanth.

Mr. Gopal Rao was instrumental in introducing the forearm-long maddale instead of the traditional maddale that is 30-inch long. These two maddales are now used in Yakshagana shows.

Born to Ayurveda doctor and Yakshagana artist Sheshgiri Rao and homemaker Lakshmibai on December 15, 1919, Gopala Rao learnt to play the maddale from his father. He learnt the Yakshagana dance under Nagappa Kamath.

He further trained in the instrument under Perdoor Venkata Rao. He donned some roles in the Hiriyadka mela and picked up ‘Bhagavatige’ (singing) from Srinivas Uppoor, father of renowned Bhagavatha Narayana Uppoor.

He was part of the Mandarthi Yakshagana Mela for three decades and was instrumental in forming the first Yakshagana mela in Hiriyadka.

Mr. Rao served as principal of the Yakshagana Kendra and taught various aspects of this traditional art form. Among the artists he trained are American national Martha Bush Aschan, who came to India to learn Yakshagana in 1969. He held Yakshagana training sessions and maddale classes at Ambalpady and other places.

He learnt about traditional medicine from his father and was treating patients.

283,2020/10/18,Mangaluru Dasara gets off to a colourful start,"Navaratri festivities begin in all temples of DK and Udupi

The famed Mangaluru Dasara was off to a colourful start, albeit on a low key, at the Kudroli Gokarnanatha Temple here this morning with former vice-chairperson of the Karnataka NRI Forum Arathi Krishna inaugurating the same.

The first day’s programmes started with Guru Prarthane and other rituals at the temple while Ms. Krishna inaugurated the festivities by lighting the lamp at noon. Nava Durge idols were installed at the temple hall thereafter.

With the COVID-19 pandemic still looming large, the temple’s main architect B. Janardhana Poojari wanted the festivities to be celebrated with absolute precaution,

Temple treasurer R. Padmaraj has said maintaining social distance, wearing masks, and using sanitisers were mandatory for devotees even as children below six years were not allowed inside the premises.

Barricades were erected across the temple premises to ensure devotees move in queues and maintain social distance.

The inauguration of Mangaluru Dasara at Kudroli was followed by performance of traditional Pili Vesha (tiger dance) by a few devotees. The district administration permitted the performance by not more than 10 persons strictly inside the premises of temples .

Meanwhile, Navaratri festivities began in all temples across Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts on Saturday, including Mangaladevi, Kadri Manjunatha, Mariyamma, Marigudi, and others in Mangaluru; Kateel Durga Parameshwari, Dharmasthala Manjunatha, Kukke Subrahmanya, Polali Rajarajeshwari, and others in Dakshina Kannada; Sri Krishna Mutt, Ambalapadi Mahakali, Kadiyali Mahisha Mardini, Kollur Mookambika, Kamalashile Durga Parameshwari, Anegudde Vinayaka. and other temples in Udupi district.

Officials of Gokarnanatha Temple, which will organise cultural programmes every evening from 6 p.m., has said no audience would be permitted inside the hall. Instead the programme will be beamed on large screens on the temple premises as well as live on Namma Kudla cable channel.

Many other temples too have been holding cultural programmes in open spaces, including the Dharmasthala temple where the programmes will be held in front of the temple.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/pnuaej/article32883796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGADADA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/mangaluru-dasara-gets-off-to-a-colourful-start/article32883797.ece
284,2020/10/18,Compensation cess to stay till States’ dues are met: Finance panel chief,"Says trust deficit between Centre, States exaggerated

The levy of compensation cess on Goods and Services Tax (GST) may have to be extended for quite a few years, perhaps till as late as 2025-26, to pay off States’ GST dues, Chairperson of the Fifteenth Finance Commission N.K. Singh said.

The Commission, whose report on the devolution of funds between the Centre and States for the five-year period of 2021-22 till 2025-2026 will be submitted to the government soon, will factor in unpaid compensation dues while working out States’ revenue flow calculations for the years beyond 2022.

Also read: GST Council fails to reach consensus on compensating States

Asserting that the Centre has at no point backtracked from the fact that States will get compensation for the first five years of the GST regime, Mr. Singh said “a lot of misgivings about the fiscal compact having been broken and there being a trust deficit” in the context of negotiations over the GST compensation cess were “somewhat exaggerated”.

“On the important issue of GST compensation, the last word has not been said. Both the States and the Centre are recalibrating the contours of a consensus within the GST Council. It is for the Council to take such decisions,” Mr. Singh told The Hindu. “At no point has the Centre said it will not pay for those five years. It’s only a question of how it can be adjusted in the most efficient way to undertake the borrowings,” he added.

Also read: GST Council to discuss compensation issue for third time in a row on October 12

Too much was being made of who should borrow to meet the shortfalls, Mr Singh suggested, stressing that the investing community looks at the Centre and States' combined debt, not their disaggregated debt levels.

“Cess shortfalls cannot be met from the Consolidated Fund of India. So it has to be raised through some borrowing arrangement like the present one. The only issue is the sequence of the borrowing. To some extent, it doesn’t make much of a difference. What investors see is the general government debt, not the differentiated debt between the Centre and the States. So this entire thing would be a shuffling of accounts,” he said, referring to the Centre’s decision to borrow ₹1.1 lakh crore on behalf of States and lend it onward.

GST compensation cess is levied on goods such as cars, aerated drinks and tobacco products, over and above the highest GST rate of 28%, and was to be levied for the first five years of the GST regime to compensate States. The GST Council has decided to extend the levy beyond that period to meet shortfalls in accruals this year.

“I see there is now some forward movement. I have no doubt in my mind that the Union government would make sure that the period for which the cess is extended, would be adequate enough to extinguish the liabilities which arise upto July 2022. This means that the cess may have to be continued up to a much later period, I think maybe 2025-26,” Mr. Singh, a former Revenue Secretary, said.

“It would be reasonable and rational for the Finance Commission to assume that since there is no suggestion whatsoever of any resiling of the obligations undertaken by the central government, that these revenues (assured to States) upto 2022 would not be extinguished, but carried forward. And for the period of our award, we would naturally fully reckon and take this into account,” Mr Singh said in an interview ahead of the release of his autobiography Portraits of Power.

Public debt review

Mr. Singh said expenditure pressures to cope with the pandemic, whose course is still shrouded in huge uncertainties, mean that the period ahead will require “fiscal forbearance” as opposed to fiscal rectitude, indicating that fiscal deficit and debt targets would have to become more flexible.

Also read: FMs of Congress-ruled States not happy with outcome of GST Council meet

“We are closely looking at the kind of flexibility and leeway that should be given to both the Union and the States. As a Finance Commission, one of our overriding priorities is that the Union and the States must be treated in an equal way and we have ensured that. I think a sensible course would be to introduce some flexibility both on the debt trajectory and the fiscal deficit, both for the Centre and the States, ensuring that the new fiscal compact represents the partnership between the Union and States for the future,” he said.

Higher health spend

Stressing that the pandemic has laid bare the inadequacy of India’s health infrastructure with a “very insignificant part of public outlay going to the health sector historically”, the Finance Commission chairperson said a separate chapter has been devoted in its report to consider more resources for the health sector.

While the outlay on health from both the Centre and States is just about 1% of GDP and must be enhanced, Mr. Singh pointed out that there are regional divergences, too, with poorer States having worse healthcare systems and distorted availability of doctors and hospital beds.

“Health expenditure needs to be assigned higher priority. We have devoted a dedicated chapter to health in the Commission's report, which goes into the question of how to reprioritise existing resources available more effectively, and (how to raise) additional resources for which we will consider a sector-based initiative for health,” he said, mooting a greater focus on ensuring quality infrastructure in primary health care centres and district hospitals.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/v1b39e/article32887355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/compensation-cess-to-stay-till-states-dues-are-met-finance-panel-chief/article32887356.ece

More than half of bank accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) are held by women beneficiaries, according to an RTI reply.

However, there is no gender-wise data when it comes to amount held by women and men account holders.

The number of accounts till September 9, 2020, under PMJDY was 40.63 crore, of which 22.44 crore accounts were held by women and 18.19 crore by men, said the RTI reply to Madhya Pradesh-based activist Chandra Shekhar Gaur.

The deposits in these PMJDY accounts witnessed an 8.5% rise till early September of the current fiscal year to nearly ₹1.30 lakh crore, according to the information provided by the Finance Ministry.

“The total balance under the PMJDY accounts on April 1, 2020, was ₹1,19,680.86 crore, which grew by 8.5% to ₹1,29,811.06 crore by September 9, 2020,” the government said in the Right to Information (RTI) query.

However, according to the data furnished by the Ministry, no separate data has been formed with respect to amount held by women and men account holders.

In response to a query on the number of accounts with zero balance, the RTI reply said as many as 3.01 crore accounts had no balance as of September 9, 2020.

There is no separate data on zero balance account gender wise, the Ministry added.

According to the latest data available on government website, pmjdy.gov.in, there are 40.98 crore beneficiaries with ₹1,30,360.53 crore balance as on October 7, 2020.

Of these, public sector banks (PSBs) have opened the maximum number of PMJDY accounts at 32.48 crore accounting for ₹1,00,869.65 crore balance.

Regional rural banks have as many as 7.24 crore beneficiaries (₹25,509.05 crore) while private sector banks have miniscule 1.27 crore accounts (₹3,981.83 crore).

Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana was launched in August 2014 under the National Mission for Financial Inclusion.

Initially it was for a period of four years (in two phases). It was extended beyond August 2018 with change in focus on opening accounts from every household with some modifications such as revision in overdraft (OD) facility to ₹10,000 from ₹5,000; non-conditional OD facility for amount up to ₹2,000 and revision in age limit for OD from 18-60 years to 18-65 years.",,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article11179364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28ctmit07PMJDY_+29tvkzaccount.jpg.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/pradhan-mantri-jan-dhan-yojana-women-hold-more-than-50-per-cent-of-the-accounts/article32886186.ece
286,2020/10/18,"Indicators point to economic recovery, but revival may be fragile: Brickwork","‘Govt. should address supply chain disruptions, augment aggregate demand’

After six months of severe stress triggered by the toughest lockdown so far, some high-frequency indicators point towards economic recovery but there are signs that this revival is fragile, Brickwork Ratings said.

It estimated that the economy is likely to contract by 13.5% in the second quarter (July-September), and the contraction in FY21 is likely to be about 9.5% unless the government takes immediate initiative to revive the economy. “After six months of severe stress triggered by the severest lockdown so far, there finally is some good news on the economy,” it said in a report.

The manufacturing PMI has shown a sharp increase from 52 in August to 56.8 in September, the highest in eight years. GST collections at ₹95,480 crore in September have recovered to increase by 3.8% from last year and were higher than August collections by 10%. Passenger vehicle sales had increased by 31%, while railway freight traffic showed a 15% rise.

Exports growth

After a gap of six months, merchandise exports registered 5.3% growth, driven by outbound shipments of engineering goods, petroleum products, pharmaceuticals and ready-made garments. There was an increase in power demand and generation as well.

“However, there are indications that this recovery is fragile. Capital expenditure on new projects declined by 81% in the second quarter... showing a continuous declining trend in investments,” the agency said.

Also, the core sector contracted 8.5% in August.

“The immediate task the government has to address is the removal of supply chain disruptions and augment aggregate demand to lift the economy out of the morass,” Brickwork Ratings said.

“This requires the government to initiate measures to increase public spending,” it said. “It should be less dogmatic on fiscal targets.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/nvnl97/article32883142.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THBUMANUFACTURING,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indicators-point-to-economic-recovery-but-revival-may-be-fragile-brickwork/article32883143.ece
287,2020/10/18,The Hindu Explains | What did the 2020 Economics Nobel winners discover about auction theory?,"What is auction theory? What are its applications?

The story so far: American economists Paul R. Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson, both of whom teach at Stanford University, were awarded the 2020 economics Nobel Prize last week. This year’s Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was awarded to the duo “for improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats”. The Nobel Prize committee noted that Dr. Milgrom and Dr. Wilson did not just come up with original ideas in auction theory, but they also played a crucial role in implementing their ideas.

What is auction theory?

Auction theory is a branch of economics that deals with, as the name suggests, auctions. Auctions are important to economists because they are the most widely used and also the most efficient mechanism to allocate scarce resources. The allocation of scarce resources, in turn, matters to economists because there is a limited supply of resources on earth when compared to unlimited human needs, and hence they need to be allocated only to the most urgent needs of society. In particular, auction theory deals with the various ways in which auctions can be designed to improve seller revenues, increase benefits to consumers, or even achieve both these goals at the same time.

Also Read Nobel Prizes 2020

How is it relevant?

Throughout history, countries have tried to allocate resources in various ways. Some have tried to do it through political markets, but this has often led to biased outcomes. Think of how the rationing of essential goods worked in various State-controlled economies. People who were close to the bureaucracy and the political class came out ahead of others. Lotteries are another way to allocate resources, but they do not ensure that scarce resources are allocated to people who value it the most.

Auctions, for a good reason, have been the most common tool for thousands of years used by societies to allocate scarce resources. When potential buyers compete to purchase goods in an auction, it helps sellers discover those buyers who value the goods the most. Further, selling goods to the highest bidder also helps the seller maximise his or her revenues. So, both buyers and sellers benefit from auctions.

What are its applications?

Auctions happen almost everywhere in the modern world. Even the sale of groceries in retail stores is based on an auction, albeit an implicit one that is relatively slow to adjust to changing market conditions. For instance, a supermarket manager, just as an auctioneer, tries to price his goods based on how much of it is sold during a certain day, week, or month. If there is a huge demand for a certain product and shelves empty quickly, the supermarket manager will raise its price to prevent a shortage. If another product fails to sell as fast as expected, its price may be lowered in order to clear any unsold inventory.

More sophisticated and explicit auction mechanisms are used in the allocation of capital goods such as spectrum and minerals. But whether it is the auction of spectrum waves or the sale of fruits and vegetables, auctions are at the core of allocation of scarce resources in a market economy.

What are the economists’ contributions?

To understand Dr. Milgrom and Dr. Wilson’s contributions, it is important to take note of the criticisms levelled against auctions. The most common one is that auctions can lead buyers to overpay for resources whose value is uncertain to them. This criticism, popularly known as the ‘winner’s curse’, is based on a study that showed how buyers who overpaid for U.S. oil leases in the 1970s earned low returns. Dr. Wilson was the first to study this matter. He found that rational bidders may decide to underpay for resources in order to avoid the ‘winner’s curse’, and argued that sellers can get better bids for their goods if they share more information about it with potential buyers. Dr. Milgrom added further nuance to this analysis by arguing that individual bidders may still submit vastly different bids due to their unique circumstances. A company that can sell oil at a higher price or process it at a lower cost, for instance, may be willing to pay more for crude oil.

Secondly, economists traditionally working on auction theory believed that all auctions are the same when it comes to the revenues that they managed to bring in for sellers. The auction format, in other words, did not matter. This is known as the ‘revenue equivalence theorem’. But Dr. Milgrom showed that the auction format can actually have a huge impact on the revenues earned by sellers.

The most famous case of an auction gone wrong for the seller was the spectrum auction in New Zealand in 1990. In what is called a ‘Vickrey auction’, where the winner of the auction is mandated to pay only the second-best bid, a company that bid NZ$1,00,000 eventually paid just NZ$6 and another that bid NZ$70,00,000 only paid NZ$5,000.

In particular, Dr. Milgrom showed how Dutch auctions, in which the auctioneer lowers the price of the product until a buyer bids for it, can help sellers earn more revenues than English auctions. In the case of English auctions, the price rises based on higher bids submitted by competing buyers. But as soon as some of the bidders drop out of the auction as the price rises, the remaining bidders become more cautious about bidding higher prices.

Dr. Milgrom and Dr. Wilson, however, are most popular for their contribution towards devising new, real-world auction formats. The combinatorial auctions designed by the duo, for instance, have been used to sell complex goods such as spectrum as bundles, instead of as individual units. Earlier, governments sold spectrum rights on a piecemeal basis, which made it unappealing to companies which demanded spectra in a bundle. This led to private speculators earning billions in the secondary market by reselling spectrum, while the government was starved of revenues that it could have easily earned with better auction design.

How do these contributions matter?

The contributions of Dr. Milgrom and Dr. Wilson have helped governments and private companies design their auctions better. This has, in turn, helped in the better allocation of scarce resources and offered more incentives for sellers to produce complex goods.

In fact, Auctionomics, a firm Dr. Milgrom co-founded, has been helping companies and governments design auctions, thus adding to other innovative auction formats adopted over the centuries by sellers trying to maximise revenues. Lastly, not all economists necessarily agree with the popular use of Dr. Milgrom and Dr. Wilson’s work on the ‘winner’s curse’ to take a dim view of auctions. They argue that while enthusiastic bidding may lower the returns earned by companies, it will not necessarily lead to higher prices for consumers, as is commonly believed. This is because in any competitive market, pricing of consumer goods is based on what the market will bear, rather than on sunk costs. Further, persistent overbidding is unlikely as financial losses weed out inefficient speculators over time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/u9j0yn/article32883921.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NOBELECONOMICS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/the-hindu-explains-what-did-the-2020-economics-nobel-winners-discover-about-auction-theory/article32883922.ece
288,2020/10/18,Ask us: On investment,"The choice of an insurance company should be a natural progression of this.

All eggs in one basket

Q. I am a 41-year-old from Chennai and have bought a medical insurance policy named iHealth for myself recently from ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd. In addition to my health insurance, I have also taken two-wheeler and accident insurance policies from ICICI Lombard. Likewise, I am paying premium for two unit-linked insurance policies with SBI Life Insurance Company for the past three years (one is a pension policy and the other, a life insurance policy) and also have selected SBI as the fund manager in Tier I of my NPS account. I would like to know what the advantages and disadvantages of enrolling with a single insurer for various insurance products are?

SETHURAMAN H

A. Congratulations on being a believer in insurance for so many of your needs and for your several and diversified investment options.

The core decision you have to make when buying insurance is whether a product suits your requirements, about which you should have clarity.

The choice of an insurance company should be a natural progression of this. Having said this, if you have several policies with the same insurer for whatever reason, you become a priority customer and the relationship gets stronger to your benefit.

Administration of policies becomes easier in case of change of address, for example, as you have to get in touch only with one person in the organisation, usually. Across life and general insurance, this synergy will work if you have gone through the same intermediary because the entities, even if they belong to the same business group, are entirely different. Of course, the intermediary can simply be the bank that also belongs to the same group!

Coming to the disadvantages, should the business group face difficulties, then all your products will also be at risk and administrative and procedural issues can get bogged down and complicated.

But your benefits and rights as a policyholder will be safeguarded even if your insurer fails because Indian insurance regulations ensure that another insurer will be given the responsibility.

Starting health insurance policy

Q. My father is 60 years old. Is it possible to start a new health insurance policy with full claim from now?

T. K. P. THAMARA

A. The short answer to that is ‘No.’ There will be a blanket 30-day waiting period for any claim under a new policy except hospitalisation because of an accident.

At his age, a pre-underwriting medical examination will be necessary and all hospitalisation policies exclude pre-existing conditions for three or four years.

In addition, some treatments and procedures will be payable after two years and this differs from policy to policy.

289,2020/10/18,Can you achieve the right balance in hybrid funds?,"Investor must go for a goal-based portfolio that earns interest from bonds and capital appreciation from equity investments

Should you consider investing in hybrid funds for your goal-based portfolios? In this article, we discuss two factors that are often cited as advantages of investing in such funds. We urge you to consider the following arguments before you decide on investing in such funds.

Asset allocation

A hybrid fund is one that invests in both equity and bonds. So, such funds ought to help investors with their asset allocation decision. This refers to how you allocate your annual savings between equity and bond investments.

Suppose you are unsure of the proportion of equity and bond investments to have in your portfolio. By investing in a hybrid fund, you could outsource your asset allocation decision to the manager of the fund, so the argument goes.

The issue is that each goal you pursue requires different asset allocation. For instance, the asset allocation for your child’s education portfolio must be different from your retirement portfolio. Hybrid funds cannot consider your individual goal requirement as it is a collective investment vehicle.

Now, hybrid funds range from equity-oriented funds that may have above 65% in equity to debt-oriented funds that are predominantly invested in bonds. Therefore, you ought to decide on the proportion of equity and bonds you want in your portfolio to select an appropriate hybrid fund. But if you can figure that out, you would have arrived at your asset allocation requirement! Then, you could just as well consider investing separately in equity funds and bonds.

Tax efficiency

But hybrid funds offer tax efficiency, the argument goes. Based on current tax laws, a hybrid fund that holds 65% or more in equity is considered as an equity fund. So, if you redeem your units in such hybrid funds after a holding period of more than 12 months, you have to pay long-term capital gains tax of 10%. If a hybrid fund holds less than 65% in equity, you have to pay 20% capital gains tax with indexation if you sell your units after a holding period of more than 36 months.

Now, suppose you invest 70% in equity funds and 30% in bond funds separately, you have to pay 10% capital gains tax on your equity investment and 20% on your long-term bond investments. However, if you invest in a hybrid fund with the same asset allocation, you will pay only 10% on your total investment.

The above argument is valid if you want to invest in bond funds to meet your bond allocation. Or, if you are willing to assume market risk on your bond investments just to save taxes. Should you?

Conclusion

You will pay higher taxes on your bond investments if you invest in bank fixed deposits instead of investing in bond funds or in hybrid funds. But higher taxes are a trade-off for stable returns. Your fixed deposits and recurring deposits will provide a steady stream of income returns compounded through the time horizon for your life goal. Whereas your bond funds or bond portion of your hybrid funds are marked-to-market through net asset value. You, therefore, expose your bond investments to price fluctuations (and perhaps capital loss) in an attempt to earn higher return.

It is preferable to have a goal-based portfolio that earns interest income from bond investments and capital appreciation from equity investments.

Finally, diversification through equity and bonds can never be argued as a reason for investing in hybrid funds; for, the question is, how to invest in equity and bonds, and not whether to invest in these asset classes.

The above discussion is not meant to discourage you from investing in hybrid funds. Rather, the objective is to urge you to consider these factors before investing in such funds.

290,2020/10/18,Pause before you plunge,"To avoid overheated markets, an investor may pick passive index funds and raise equity allocation on corrections

Worldwide stock prices and the underlying fundamentals of the stocks have never been as disconnected as they are today.

Certain large companies have crossed $1 trillion in valuations in the American markets. The term centibillionaire (someone who has a net worth of $100 billion) has become common usage in the pink press.

The main reason for such euphoria has been the infusion of huge amounts of liquidity into global markets by all central banks, including our own Reserve Bank of India. The developed world has borrowed heavily and been very generous in giving stimulus to businesses so that the fall in economic activity can be cushioned.

India remains the only large nation which has not given a substantial direct stimulus.

The conventional wisdom was this money would make its way through the economy and reach those who deserved it, such as small and medium enterprises. However, despite the huge liquidity, banks in India and globally have become risk-averse and are not making fresh loans.

Bond EFT purchases

The Federal Reserve, in an unconventional action, has been buying bond ETFs and at times, junk bond ETFs to prop up the credit markets. Thus, it was natural for the excess money to cross the ocean and reach Indian shores.

The money has been chasing quality Indian stocks and this has created a narrow top in the Indian equities markets. Price action in a handful of stocks is driving the value of the index.

More than 60% of investments in India have been in one company which is primarily a provider of telecom services. The market would like to believe that it has reincarnated as the next tech wonder. The same company is now selling a minority stake in its retail business for astronomical valuations.

Offsetting NPAs

A handful of private sector banks have raised equity capital to offset a probable rise in non-performing assets. At the end of trading hours on October 16, the price to earnings ratio of the Nifty was 34.13 times its trailing 12 months earnings. The normal valuation should be around 15 to 18 times earnings. The current EPS of the Nifty is in between 348 and 350.

If one were to look at the index returns for the last three years, the return on investment has been very poor and nothing to write home about. The one-year return was 3.76%, 2-year return was 13.96% and the 3-year-return 16.4%*.

This is the reason why, after a big rally from the lows of March, retail investors are continuously pulling money out of the Indian stock markets.

As data from AMFI has shown us, there are two ways that a stock price can rise: a continuous increase in the earnings of the company and its subsidiaries; an expansion in the price-earnings ratio of the stock.

The latter means that the new investor is willing to pay a higher price for stocks whose earnings have not increased.

Triple whammy

This is largely due to the triple whammy of demonetisation, a faulty GST and finally a global pandemic. Let us assume the worst is behind us and corporate earnings will bounce back. A 30% increase in profit will translate to an EPS of 450. Even then, the price-earnings multiple will be almost 28 times earnings and will have no upside left for investors to benefit from.

With any meaningful appreciation of stocks thus ruled out, any global event can send the price of equities tumbling down. The truth is, we do not know when the pandemic will end or a vaccine will be ready.

Hence, a sharp rebound in profits of index stocks is an unlikely event. I have mentioned a narrow top. Here is the evidence.**

1. Reliance Industries 14.9%

2. Infosys 7.62%

3. TCS 5.4%

4. HDFC Bank 9.67%

Total 37.6%

That is, these four stocks above have contributed to a weight of 37.6% of the index.

1. Hindustan Unilever 3.81%

2. HDFC 6.43%

3. ICICI 5.05%

If you add 3 more stocks totalling to 15.3%, the contribution of the 7 stocks crosses 50% of the weight of the index.

The balance 43 stocks contribute the remaining. This is why no active fund manager has been able to beat the Nifty thanks to the SEBI ruling which does not allow the fund manager to invest 10% in a single stock. The feeling in the market that it is less risky to invest today is erroneous.

As American investor Howard Marks has pointed out, the higher the price levels, the greater the risk.

There seems to be a mob psychology of fear of missing out on a good thing.

“People should like something less when its price rises, but in investing they often like it more,” he had said.

This is primarily driven by envy and greed when one believes his neighbour or colleague has made quick money while he himself has missed out. One should remember that the legendary Sir Isaac Newton lost his fortune in the South Sea bubble and said: “I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies but not the madness of the people.”

If at all one has to take exposure to equity, it is better to buy passive index funds and increase allocations as the market corrects but one must again remember Mr. Mark’s quotation, “Investment success doesn’t come from ‘buying good things,’ but rather from ‘buying things well.’

291,2020/10/18,Jet’s creditors agree to Kalrock-Jalan plan,"Flights may take 3-6 months to start

Jet Airways would be acquired by an investor consortium under a multimillion dollar resolution plan approved by the carrier’s creditors on Saturday.

The plan submitted by a consortium of London-based Kalrock Capital and UAE-based businessman Murari Lal Jalan comes after months of talks and was confirmed in a regulatory filing, which gave no details.

Stake for creditors

A source close to the situation said the new owners had agreed to pump in ₹10 billion ($136 million) as working capital. Another ₹10 billion will be given to creditors over five years. Financial creditors will also get 10% stake, subject to approvals, the source said.

Jet, which operated more than 120 planes serving dozens of domestic destinations and international hubs, was forced in April 2019 to ground all flights.

After Jet halted operations at least 280 slots were vacant in Mumbai and 160 in Delhi, which were then given to its rivals. The revival plan is also based on getting some of these slots back.

CLUE: Cricket captain, heartless automaton (4)

Clue types : letter-pick

Definition : Cricket captain

Answer : ROOT

Clue explained:

A nice and easy 4-letter clue here, if you’re into the game of cricket. If you aren’t, the rest of the clue gives you all the help you may need to get the answer!

So, just look at the wordplay. Look at the word ‘heartless’. That is rather standard word that setters use to indicate that you need to take away the central letter (the ‘heart’) of an adjacent word, hence ‘heartless’.

Seeing the word ‘automaton’ should make the word ROBOT jump to your mind as easily as grasshopper named R2D2.

And if ROBOT is ‘heartless’, you need to delete its central letter B. And that gives you ROOT.

Guess what, ROOT is the name of the captain of the English Test cricket team!",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/cl79hl/article29514759.ece/alternates/FREE_660/TH26-DRAVID-CONGHC6GA9K23jpgjpg,https://crossword.thehindu.com/clued-in/clued-in-158-a-dravid-a-droid-and-a-druid-walk-into-a-bar/article32887900.ece
