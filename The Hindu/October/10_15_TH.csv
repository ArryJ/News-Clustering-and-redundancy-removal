0,2020/10/15,Australian Open chief wants quarantine relaxed for players,"Australian Open chief executive Craig Tiley wants international tennis players arriving for the first Grand Slam tournament of 2021 to be exempt from the 14-day strict hotel quarantines that are mandatory now for inbound travelers.

Tiley on Thursday said he remains absolutely confident the Australian Open will go ahead as planned at Melbourne Park from Jan. 18-31, along with lead-up events including the men’s ATP Cup and tournaments in Brisbane, Sydney and Hobart.

He said he is counting on Australia’s state and federal governments to relax border restrictions and grant special approval for players to go into a bio-secure training bubble, similar to what the U.S. Open and French Open did recently, to prepare for the tournament but remain isolated from the public.

“If a player has to ... be stuck in a hotel for two weeks just before their season, that won’t happen,” Tiley told the Australian Associated Press.

“You can’t ask players to quarantine for two weeks and then step out and be ready to play a Grand Slam.”

Roger Federer and Serena Williams, both of whom will turn 40 in 2021, have already committed to playing in Australia but Tiley said players simply won’t show up if they’re not allowed to prepare properly.

“We completely accept that everyone coming from overseas has got to have two weeks in quarantine,” Tiley said, “but what we are negotiating, or what we’re trying to have an agreement on, is that we set up a quarantine environment where they can train and go between the hotel and the courts in those two weeks.”

At the U.S. Open and French Open, players weren’t required to quarantine but instead had to operate in a bio-secure bubble and undergo regular COVID-19 tests before being allowed to compete. Players wore masks between matches at Roland Garros, where Rafael Nadal beat Novak Djokovic in the men’s final last weekend.

Tiley said preparations for the Australian Open are getting to crunch time now.

“We need commitments from the governments and the health officers,” he said. “We need to kind of know in the next two weeks, maybe a month, that this is what can happen: borders are going to open and then we can have a multi-city event.”

“If we cannot have a multi-city event, we’ve got to reconsider everything. Melbourne has been one of Australia’s hardest-hit cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. A second wave of the coronavirus forced a overnight curfews and a six-week lockdown for its 5 million residents. Still, organizers are planning to have spectators at the Australian Open — up to 50% of capacity — with social distancing regulations in place.”

If state borders aren’t re-opened, Tiley didn’t rule out the ATP Cup and potentially other tournament being held in Melbourne, just as the Cincinnati hard-court tournament was staged at Flushing Meadows before the U.S. Open.

“Anything is possible right now,” Tiley said.

Tesla’s long-awaited advanced autopilot option – Full Self-Driving (FSD), will be released in a limited beta on October 20, CEO Elon Musk tweeted.

“This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert & careful drivers,” Musk added.

FSD is one of the two autopilot options available to Tesla owners. Still, drivers are said to be fully attentive, and to place their hands on the wheel to be prepared to take over at any moment.

Both the autopilot options on the Tesla cars currently offer features to help drivers, however it has not reached a stage where the features make the vehicles autonomous.

FSD features include actively guiding the car from a highway’s on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting lane changes, automatically engaging the turn signal and taking the correct exit; automatically parallel or perpendicular park; move the car in and out of a tight space using the mobile app or key.

2,2020/10/15,Microsoft says its AI captions images as accurately as humans do,"The captioning model rolled out through its cloud platform will let developers to use it in their apps.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Microsoft on Wednesday unveiled an artificial intelligence (AI) system for image captioning that, it says, can describe images as accurately as humans do.

The Redmond-based technology company said the new image captioning system is two times better than the image captioning model that’s been used in Microsoft product and services since 2015.

The captioning model rolled out through its cloud platform will let developers to use it in their apps.

“Image captioning is one of the core computer vision capabilities that can enable a broad range of services,” Xuedong Huang, Microsoft’s CTO, Azure AI Cognitive Services, said in a statement.

It is available in Seeing AI, a Microsoft app for blind and visually impaired users and will start rolling out later this year in Microsoft Word and Outlook, for Windows and Mac, and PowerPoint for Windows, Mac and web.

The feature will be used to generate alt text, photo description in a web page or document for people with no or limited eye-sight.

With Seeing AI, Microsoft aims to improve image captioning capability in Seeing AI talking camera app for differently abled people to describe photos, including those from social media apps.

Microsoft pre-trained a large AI model by pairing images with word tags, which were specific to the object in an image. Using word tags instead of full captions allowed researchers to feed lots of data into their model.

The pre-trained model was then fine-tuned for captioning on the dataset of captioned images. When it was presented with an image containing novel objects, the AI system leveraged the visual vocabulary to generate an accurate caption.

The model was evaluated on nocaps, the benchmark that evaluates AI systems on how well they generate captions for objects in images. The result showed AI system created captions that were more descriptive and accurate than the captions for the same images that were written by people, according to results presented in a research paper titled, VIVO: Surpassing Human Performance in Novel Object Captioning with Visual Vocabulary Pre-Training.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/tulh8a/article32862527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/microsoft-ai-captioningpng,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microsoft-says-its-ai-captions-images-as-accurately-as-humans-do/article32862502.ece
3,2020/10/15,Apple can continue its ban on Fortnite from App Store,"However, the court temporarily restrained Apple from taking any action with respect to the Epic affiliates’ developer tools and accounts.

Apple need not bring back Fortnite into its App Store as Epic Games’ request to restore Fortnite post an App Store ban has been turned by a U.S. District Judge.

""The Court maintains its findings from the temporary restraining order and hereby grants in part and denies in part Epic Games' motion for a preliminary injunction,"" said Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, U.S. District Judge in a ruling issued on Friday.

After Apple banned Fortnite from its App Store, Epic Games filed a request for reinstating Fortnite onto App Store, and to stop Apple from terminating Epic affiliates’ access to developer tools for other applications, including Unreal Engine.

Apple believes Epic can release a version of the game with contract-breaking direct payments option removed, if the gaming company really wants iOS users to access Fortnite. It even offered the 30% payment required by Apple's IAP policy to be placed in an escrow pending resolution of the trial. But Epic Games rejected the offer.

""The refusal to do so suggests Epic Games is not principally concerned with iOS consumers, but rather, harbours other tactical motives,"" said Rogers.

However, the court temporarily restrained Apple from taking any action with respect to the Epic affiliates’ developer tools and accounts.

“Apple has chosen to act severely, and by doing so, has impacted non-parties and a third-party developer ecosystem. In this regard, the equities do weigh against Apple,"" said Rogers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ervwre/article32862397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Applefortnite,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/apple-can-continue-its-ban-on-fortnite-from-app-store/article32862360.ece

Zoom on Wednesday said it will open its video-calling platform for ticketed online events for paid subscribers to create, host and monetise events like fitness classes, concerts, stand-up shows, and music lessons.

The announcement follows Facebook’s decision to let users host online paid events after the pandemic halted in-person gatherings.

“When business owners, entrepreneurs, and organizations of all sizes had to find some way – any way – to stay the course and continue providing services to their customers, many turned to Zoom,” Zoom said in a statement.

The new service will allow businesses and entrepreneurs to schedule and host one-time events, an event series, or drop-ins for up to 1,000 attendees. They can list and sell tickets, and share and promote public events through email or social media.

Attendees can search the directory of search the directory of public events and purchase tickets online via PayPal or other major credit cards. They can also purchase and gift OnZoom tickets to their friends and family, and donate to non-profit organisations through fundraiser events.

In a separate update, Zoom said it will start rolling out end-to-end encryption offering from next week. Both free and paid users will be able to host up to 200 people in an encrypted meeting on the platform.

“We’re pleased to roll out Phase 1 of 4 of our E2EE [end-to-end encryption] offering, which provides robust protections to help prevent the interception of decryption keys that could be used to monitor meeting content,” Zoom said.

To use the feature, participants must enable E2EE meetings at the account level and opt-in to E2EE on a per-meeting basis. Hosts can enable the setting for E2EE at the account, group, and user level and can be locked at the account or group level. All participants must have the setting enabled to join an E2EE meeting.

To know whether a meeting is using E2EE, participants can look for a green shield logo in the upper left corner of their meeting screen with a padlock in the middle.

The company said it plans to roll out better identity management and E2EE SSO integration as part of Phase 2, tentatively in 2021.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/z2qemm/article32862385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/zoom-online-eventjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/zoom-to-allow-ticketed-online-events-adds-end-to-end-encryption/article32862335.ece
5,2020/10/15,"Alphabet's robotic plant buggy can scan crops, gather data","The US-based company developed a low-emission electric powered plant buggy fitted with solar panels that can roll through the fields, scanning crops and collecting high quality images of each plant.

Google's parent Alphabet has developed a robotic plant buggy to scan crops and generate data to help farmers grow food.

""Just as the microscope led to a transformation in how diseases are detected and managed, we hope that better tools will enable the agriculture industry to transform how food is grown,"" Alphabet said in a statement.

The US-based company developed a low-emission electric powered plant buggy fitted with solar panels that can roll through the fields, scanning crops and collecting high quality images of each plant.

The images are combined with satellite imagery, weather data, and soil information, to get a clear picture of the happenings in the field.

The buggy collects plant-level data, and the robotics, sensing and software tools collect and interpret diverse data from the field.

The company believes that the current tools do not help farmers understand agriculture’s complexity and take effective decisions. The new tool collecting important data from the field, like plant height, leaf area and fruit size, can help farmers predict size and yield of their crop, enabling them to make better yield projections, Alphabet added.

The company used machine learning to spot patterns about how plants grow and interact with their environment. The buggy comes in different shapes and sizes so that it can adapt to fields with different crops. It has plant mapping and identification GPS software to locate plants. Its sophisticated cameras and machine perception tools can spot issues in the field and analyse plant traits.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/9yngzj/article32862235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/plantbuggy,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/alphabets-robotic-plant-buggy-can-scan-crops-gather-data/article32862270.ece

YouTube is now part of Google's advertising reporting model. The inclusion is said to help advertisers gain more insights on their ads played on the video-streaming platform.

The company said it added YouTube into the attribution fold as more people are turning to the video-streaming service.

Attribution in Google Ads awards credit for conversions to different ads, clicks, and factors along the way, so that advertisers can focus their investments on the media having the biggest impact on results.

YouTube ads in attribution reports is now available in beta to eligible advertisers.

Google will also be adding Display ads to attribution reports in the coming months, and will be using machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each ad.

To make its report available to more advertisers, Google has lowered data requirements to 3000 ad interactions and at least 300 conversions withing 30 days.

Google also shared updates to its lift measurement solutions including a new way to measure incremental conversions and an accelerated time frame to get faster results.

Conversion lift, that measures the impact of YouTube ads on website visits, sign ups, purchase and other types of conversions is now available in beta mode. Google has added accelerated flights to get the brand perception metrics faster with the ability to re-measure over time.

It is also reporting Search Lift and Conversion Lift results as soon as they become available, with daily reporting to see changes more frequently and over time.

10,2020/10/15,Yemen’s warring sides begin hard-won prisoner exchange,"They are to exchange 1,081 prisoners over two days

A hard-won prisoner exchange between the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels got under way on Thursday with the departure of the first planeloads of released combatants.

The warring sides in Yemen’s long conflict are to exchange 1,081 prisoners over two days under a deal struck in Switzerland last month, the largest number since the conflict erupted in 2014.

One of them was headed for the city of Abha in neighbouring Saudi Arabia with released prisoners of war from a Saudi-led military coalition that supports the Yemeni government, rebel officials said. Those on board included 15 Saudis and four Sudanese.

Planes are also due to depart from Abha and from the Yemeni government-held city of Seiyun in a complex operation overseen by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), rebel officials said. United Nations (UN) Yemen Envoy Martin Griffiths, who attended last month’s talks in Switzerland, hailed the successful start of the operation. “Today’s release operation, led by the ICRC, is another sign that peaceful dialogue can deliver,” the Envoy said.

The Yemeni government and the Iran-backed rebels resolved to swap some 15,000 detainees as part of a peace deal brokered by the UN in Sweden back in 2018. This week’s planned swap would mark the first large-scale handover since the war erupted in 2014.

“The transaction will be executed, with God’s help, on the scheduled dates today and tomorrow,” Abdel Kader Mortaza, the rebel official in charge of prisoner affairs, said in a tweet.

“The preparations have been completed by all parties,” he added.

A spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is handling the logistics of the operation, said their teams were present at the various airports involved in the transfer.

Huthi-controlled Al-Masirah television said the first group of rebel prisoners was expected to arrive at Sanaa airport later on Thursday.

The planned exchange comes after the release Wednesday of two Americans held captive in Yemen, in an apparent swap for some 240 Huthi supporters who were allowed to return home after being stranded in neighbouring Oman.

The rebels also sent back the remains of a third American who died in captivity.

The fate of the 240 Yemenis, who had travelled to Oman for medical treatment in what was supposed to be a confidence-building move during the 2018 talks in Sweden, had become a major grievance for the rebels and a symbol of the deep distrust between the two sides.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/t2j7hi/article32865432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TH-LT-YEMEN-SECURITYPRISONERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yemens-warring-sides-begin-hard-won-prisoner-exchange/article32865433.ece
11,2020/10/15,Hong Kong police raid pro-democracy media tycoon’s office,"Hong Kong police raided a private office of pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai on Thursday as part of their investigation into whether he has broken Beijing’s new national security law.

Mr. Lai, 71, is among more than two dozen people who have been arrested under a draconian security law imposed by Beijing in June to quell massive pro-democracy protests over the past year.

Police confirmed the raid was triggered by officers from the same newly-formed national security unit that first arrested him in April. “ No person was arrested today,” the police said. Mr. Lai accused officers of removing items before his lawyers could get there. “It seems that they are looking for every possible reason to charge me,” Mr. Lai told presspersons.“The police didn’t even wait for the lawyer to come before they took things away, so that’s not rule of law,” he added.

Mr. Lai was first detained under the new law in August on suspicion of “collusion with foreign forces” and fraud. Officers raided his Apple Daily newspaper that day and he was later released on bail.

He also faces prosecution over his alleged part in last year’s protests.

Mark Simon, one of Mr. Lai’s top aides, said 14 police officers raided an office of a company owned by Mr. Lai on Thursday.

“[The] goal here is to cut money off to Apple Daily,” he said.

Mr. Simon, who is also a director of the raided office, said he spoke by phone with the officers and said they ignored requests to wait for company lawyers.

Hong Kong police’s statement did not address the accusation they acted before lawyers were present but they said they had a warrant from a magistrate.

A few hours later, Mr. Lai appeared in court for a procedural hearing in the prosecution of some two dozen activists who took part in a vigil earlier this year, marking Beijing’s deadly 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.

12,2020/10/15,Coronavirus | Sri Lanka faces biggest test yet to its virus response,"Country reported nearly 2,000 new cases in the last 10 days; the Army is leading an extensive contact-tracing exercise

As the number of daily cases of COVID-19 continues to rise in Sri Lanka, following a new wave identified at a garment factory earlier this month, the spotlight has fallen on two issues. One, the source of these infections, and the other, the plight of workers engaged in the apparel factories that fetch precious foreign exchange.

Although Sri Lanka contained the pandemic effectively in the last few months, the latest outbreak is the biggest test yet to the country’s much-hailed pandemic response from the public health sector with the Army’s support. Especially since authorities are yet to track down the source of the latest cluster, unlike in the previous waves of COVID-19 infections in the country.

Sri Lanka’s Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera has said the woman worker who tested positive on October 4 may not be the first case, while cautioning the public about a more virulent strain of the virus attack this time.

Steep rise

The recent bout of infections — nearly 2,000 new cases in the last 10 days — is witnessing the steepest rise in cases in Sri Lanka since the global pandemic hit the island nation in March. The new cluster, known as the ‘Brandix cluster’, referring to the garment factory where it broke out, has infected several hundred workers and their contacts in the last two weeks.

The Army has since been leading an extensive contact-tracing exercise to find all those that the over 1,000 workers — who tested positive — may have met. They have so far traced patients from 21 out of Sri Lanka’s 25 districts. Curfews have been limited to areas around the cluster, in contrast to the government’s earlier response of shutting down the entire country for two months.

“Our main strategy is the same as before — to trace, isolate and provide swift treatment to those found infected. This time, we find more middle-aged and older people infected,” Dr. Jayaruwan Bandara, spokesperson of the Ministry of Health told The Hindu on Thursday.

Concern over treatment

Meanwhile, trade unionists and activists have voiced concern about the treatment of workers — those infected and others. Addressing reporters on Thursday, Sandun Thudugala of the Law and Society Trust said in several instances, Army personnel visiting the workers at their boarding rooms gave them only a few minutes to pack up and leave for the quarantine centre. “Sometimes, they are made to travel with their colleagues who tested positive. Many praised the military for their work in running quarantine centres, but why are these workers being treated differently, like second-class citizens?” he asked.

Further, the new wave has also made the workers’ employment more uncertain, according to Anton Marcus, joint secretary, Free Trade Zones and General Services Employees Union. “There are some 37,000 workers engaged in the Free Trade Zone in Katunayake [near Colombo]. Following the two-month curfew earlier, several of them lost their jobs and their employment benefits were withdrawn. Workers are also complaining of very poor facilities in their quarantine centres. We have urged the government to look into this,” he said. The Employer’s Federation of Ceylon has estimated job cuts for 21% of the labour force in the export sector.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iqpmb9/article32865455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SRILANKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-sri-lanka-faces-biggest-test-yet-to-its-virus-response/article32865359.ece
13,2020/10/15,"Despite ban, thousands join Thai protest","Govt. had issued decree banning public gatherings and censoring media; protest leaders arrested

Thousands of protesters demonstrated in Thailand’s Bangkok on Thursday, defying a ban imposed to end three months of anti-government action that has targeted King Maha Vajiralongkorn as well as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader.

Despite police appeals over a loudspeaker to disperse, the group spilled across the Ratchaprasong Intersection in one of Bangkok’s busiest commercial districts. It was the scene of bloodshed in 2010, during more than a decade of violence between supporters and opponents of the Thai establishment.

“Like dogs cornered, we are fighting till our deaths,” said Panupong ‘Mike Rayong’ Jadnok, one the high-profile protest leaders who remains free. “We won’t fall back. We won’t run away. We won’t go anywhere,” he told the cheering crowd.

Protesters also filled the walkways of the nearby shopping complex, holding up the three-finger salute adopted as a symbol of opposition after Mr. Prayuth’s 2014 coup.

“The people who came know that there is a ban against public gathering of five or more,” police spokesperson Kissana Phathanacharoen said. “We will take things step by step.”

Three months of protests in the country of 70 million have been largely peaceful, as was a march by tens of thousands of people on Wednesday. But in one incident, police pushed jeering protesters away from a motorcade carrying Queen Suthida.

Overnight the government banned political gatherings of five or more people and the publication of news and online information that could threaten national security.

“The measures were necessary to ensure peace and order and to prevent further incidents after protesters affected the royal motorcade and violated the monarchy with provocative language,” government spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri said in a statement.

‘End it with us’

The protests have largely been driven by students and young people.

“We don’t want anyone or the next generation to have to put up with this. We have to end it with us,” said Mameaw, 17, who came to the protest right after school exams.

Police said they had arrested protest leaders Parit ‘Penguin’ Chiwarak and rights lawyer Arnon Nampa. Mr. Arnon said on Facebook he was being forced to board a helicopter to the northern city of Chiang Mai, where he faces sedition charges over a speech in August.

The protest movement aims to remove Mr. Prayuth, saying he manipulated an election last year to keep hold of power. He says the election was fair.

Those marching on the streets also want a new Constitution and have called for a reduction in the powers of the King. They want his role to be clearly subject to the Constitution and seek the reversal of orders that gave him control of the palace fortune and some army units.

Criticism of the monarchy is punishable by up to 15 years in prison under lese majeste laws, though Mr. Prayuth said earlier this year the King had asked that they not be enforced for now.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vzfbpp/article32865323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TH-LT-THAILAND-PROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/despite-ban-thousands-join-thai-protest/article32865324.ece
14,2020/10/15,World facing new Bretton Woods moment: IMF MD,"Prudent macroeconomic policies and strong institutions are critical for growth, jobs and improved living standards, says Kristalina Georgieva

Facing the twin task of fighting the coronavirus pandemic today and building a better tomorrow, the world is experiencing a new Bretton Woods moment, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday.

Addressing the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund’s Board of Governors, she said that what was true at Bretton Woods, when allies at the end of World War II gathered for a conference to create the institutions that would use economic cooperation to prevent future conflicts, remains true today.

“Today we face a new Bretton Woods moment. A pandemic that has already cost more than a million lives. An economic calamity that will make the world economy 4.4% smaller this year and strip an estimated $11 trillion of output by next year. And untold human desperation in the face of huge disruption and rising poverty for the first time in decades, she said.

“Once again, we face two massive tasks: to fight the crisis today and build a better tomorrow, she said.

Prudent macroeconomic policies and strong institutions are critical for growth, jobs and improved living standards, she said.

Strong medium-term frameworks for monetary, fiscal and financial policies, as well as reforms to boost trade, competitiveness and productivity can help create confidence for policy action now while building much-needed resilience for the future, she added.

“We know what action must be taken right now. A durable economic recovery is only possible if we beat the pandemic. Health measures must remain a priority. I urge you to support production and distribution of effective therapies and vaccines to ensure that all countries have access,” Ms. Georgieva said.

She urged countries to continue support for workers and businesses until a durable exit from the health crisis.

“We have seen global fiscal actions of $12 trillion. Major central banks have expanded balance sheets by $7.5 trillion. These synchronised measures have prevented the destructive macro financial feedback we saw in previous crises,” she said.

“But almost all countries are still hurting, especially emerging market and developing economies. And while the global banking system entered the crisis with high capital and liquidity buffers, there is a weak tail of banks in many in emerging markets. We must take measures to prevent the build-up of financial risks over the medium term, she said.

The IMF expects 2021 debt levels to go up significantly — to around 125% of GDP in advanced economies, 65% of GDP in emerging markets; and 50 per cent of GDP in low-income countries, Ms. Georgieva further said.

The fund is providing debt relief to its poorest members and, with the World Bank, they support extension by the G20 of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative.

“Beyond this, where debt is unsustainable, it should be restructured without delay. We should move towards greater debt transparency and enhanced creditor coordination. I am encouraged by G-20 discussions on a Common framework for Sovereign Debt Resolution as well as on our call for improving the architecture for sovereign debt resolution, including private sector participation, she said.

Ms. Georgieva said that to reap the full benefits of sound economic policy, they must invest more in people. That means protecting the vulnerable. It also means boosting human and physical capital to underpin growth and resilience, she argued.

“Just as the pandemic has shown that we can no longer ignore health precautions, we can no longer afford to ignore climate change...We focus on climate change because it is macrocritical, posing profound threats to growth and prosperity. It is also people-critical and planet critical, said the IMF MD.

The IMF, she said, is working tirelessly to support a durable recovery, and a resilient future as countries adapt to structural transformations brought on by climate change, digital acceleration and the rise of the knowledge economy.

Since the pandemic began, IMF has committed over $100 billion and still has substantial resources from its $1 trillion in lending capacity, she said.

“We will continue to pay special attention to the urgent needs of emerging markets and low income countries especially small and fragile states, helping them to pay doctors and nurses and protect the most vulnerable people and parts of their economies, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9dsg7i/article32862701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMF-WORLDBANKECONOMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world-facing-new-bretton-woods-moment-imf-md/article32862702.ece
15,2020/10/15,"Coronavirus | European cases rocket, strong limits needed: WHO","In a press briefing Thursday, Dr. Hans Kluge warned that even more drastic steps could be taken if the pandemic does not recede

The exponential surge of coronavirus cases across Europe has warranted the restrictive measures being taken in numerous countries, making them absolutely necessary, the head of the World Health Organization’s Europe office says.

In a press briefing Thursday, Dr. Hans Kluge warned that even more drastic steps could be taken if the pandemic does not recede.

He called for countries to be uncompromising in their attempts to control the virus and said most of the COVID-19 spread is happening in homes, indoor spaces and communities not complying with protection measures.

These measures are meant to keep us all ahead of the curve and to flatten its course, Dr. Kluge said, while wearing a mask.

It is therefore up to us to accept them while they are still relatively easy to follow.

Dr. Kluge cited epidemiological models that suggested if 95% of people wear masks and other social distancing measures are applied, Europe could avoid about 281,000 deaths by February. But he warned that relaxing measures could lead to a five-fold increase in deaths by January.

The evolving epidemic in Europe raises great concern, he said. But we should not hold back with relatively smaller actions in order to avoid the same very painful damaging actions we saw in the first peak.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lupqfr/article31356344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THHANSKLUGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-european-cases-rocket-strong-limits-needed-who/article32862432.ece
16,2020/10/15,EU imposes sanctions on six Russian officials over Alexei Navalny poisoning,"The move came a day after Russia’s Foreign Minister warned that Moscow might respond with similar measures

The European Union on Thursday imposed sanctions on six Russian officials and one organisation over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a Soviet-era nerve agent.

The move came a day after Russia’s Foreign Minister warned that Moscow might respond with similar measures.

The decision was agreed upon among the 27 EU envoys to Brussels.

The adopted restrictive measures consist of a travel ban to the EU and an asset freeze for individuals, and an asset freeze for the entity,” the EU said in a statement.

The list includes two high level officials in the Presidential Executive Office, a director of the federal security service and two deputy ministers in the Russian defense ministry. The EU is also targeting the State Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology.

EU Foreign Ministers agreed on Monday to impose the sanctions, following a push by France and Germany to freeze the assets of those suspected of involvement and ban them from traveling in Europe under sanctions to combat the use and spread of chemical weapons.

Mr. Navalny, an anti-corruption investigator and major political opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, fell ill on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia. He was flown to Germany for treatment two days later and is still recovering there.

Last week, tests conducted at labs designated by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed that Navalny was poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview on Wednesday that the Germans are not planning to provide any facts, despite all international and legal obligations. We respond in kind. This is diplomatic practice. On Tuesday, Mr. Lavrov suggested that Moscow might even sever ties.

We probably simply have to temporarily stop talking to those people in the West who are responsible for foreign policy and don’t understand the need for mutually respectful dialogue, he said.

Mr. Lavrov specifically pointed at European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s recent statements ruling out a partnership with Russia, saying that scenario will play out if that’s what the EU wants.

Russia wants to understand whether it’s possible to do any business with the EU in the current conditions, Mr. Lavrov said at a foreign policy conference attended by experts in Moscow.

In a phone call Tuesday with Mr. Lavrov, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell insisted that the EU wishes to maintain open channels of communication with Russia and to enhance cooperation on issues of mutual interest, according to a statement from Borrell’s office.

Mr. Borrell also underlined that Moscow must do its utmost to investigate this crime thoroughly in full transparency and to fully cooperate with the OPCW, and that the EU will continue to defend its interests and values, including respect for international law and fundamental rights.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lq1dwe/article32517187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-NAVALNY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-imposes-sanctions-on-six-russian-officials-over-alexei-navalny-poisoning/article32862401.ece
17,2020/10/15,"U.S.’ special coordinator for Tibet aimed at destabilising it, says China","Last November, China objected to U.S.’ plans to take up the issue of a successor to the Dalai Lama to United Nations.

China on Thursday slammed the U.S. for appointing a Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues, describing Washington’s move as political manipulation aimed at destabilising Tibet.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday named Robert Destro, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labour, as the Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues.

Mr. Destro will focus on advancing dialogue between the Communist-run government in Beijing and the Dalai Lama, protecting the distinct religious cultural and linguistic identity of Tibetans, improving respect for their human rights and much, much more, Mr. Pompeo said.

Reacting to Mr. Destro’s appointment, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing in Beijing that the U.S. move amounted to interference in China’s internal affairs.

He said, “the setting up of the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues is entirely out of political manipulation to interfere in China’s internal affairs and destabilise Xizang”, the Chinese name for Tibet.

Unlike in the past, Chinese officials in recent times have been referring to Tibet only as Xizang.

“China firmly opposes that and never recognises that. People of ethnic groups in Xizang are part of the big family of Chinese nation,” Mr. Zhao said.

“Since its peaceful liberation, Xizang enjoyed prosperous economic growth, harmonious civil society and prosperous culture. People enjoyed solidarity and mutual assistance and improved livelihood. All people in Tibet enjoy their full religious freedoms and their rights are fully respected and guaranteed,” he said.

“We believe Tibet’s future will be better. The U.S. should stop interfering in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of Tibet or destabilising it. China will take all necessary measures to uphold our interests,” he said.

Since last year, the Trump administration stepped up criticisms of China’s handling of Tibet especially the issue of appointment of the Dalai Lama’s successor.

Last November, China objected to U.S.’ plans to take up the issue of a successor to the Dalai Lama to United Nations, saying Washington is misusing the UN platform to interfere in its internal affairs.

China has been asserting that its assent to successor of the present Dalai Lama is a must as the Tibetan spiritual leader turned 85 this year.

Relations between Washington and Beijing have spiralled downward since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which President Donald Trump has blamed on China. The two countries have also sparred over China imposing a new national security law in Hong Kong, restrictions on American journalists, treatment of Uyghur Muslims and security measures in Tibet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uir9iy/article32033170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ZHAOLIJIAN-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-special-coordinator-for-tibet-aimed-at-destabilising-it-says-china/article32862241.ece
18,2020/10/15,E.U. leaders divided over new climate goals for 2030,"The goal is to reach an agreement in December ahead of the adoption of the first ever European climate law.

European Union leaders remain divided about a more ambitious target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and will not reach an agreement at their summit starting Thursday.

According to a draft of the meeting’s findings seen by The Associated Press, leaders will at this summit only start discussing the proposal to reduce emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, as put forward by the EU’s executive Commission.

The goal is to reach an agreement in December ahead of the adoption of the first ever European climate law.

In proposing a reduction target of at least 55 % by 2030 compared with the current target of 40 %, EU commission President Ursula von der Leyen predicted in September that the new target would be too much for some and not enough for others.”

Supported by Germany, Von der Leyen’s revised target needs to be endorsed by the 27 EU countrie to make it legally binding.

On Wednesday, a group of 11 countries including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden embraced her ambition in a joint statement published ahead of the summit in Brussels.

Let us, as a Union, deliver a strong and credible response to the climate crisis and increase our 2030 climate target to at least 55 %, leading to climate neutrality by 2050,” they said in the statement.

But officials said there is no agreement across the bloc.

While the European Parliament pushes for an even greater 60 % reduction in emissions, some eastern EU countries that depends on coal for much of their energy needs are less enthusiastic.

They worry about the social, environmental and economic costs of the transition to a greener economy. Poland last year did not commit to the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality goal and is asking for more details about the measures.

Von der Leyen has said she wants 37 % of the 750 billion euros in the coronavirus recovery fund to be given to EU countries to spend on environmental objectives, while 30 % of the bloc’s regular budget should be used to tackling climate change.

19,2020/10/15,"U.S. destroyer sails through Taiwan Strait, provoking China","Ties between Beijing and Washington have deteriorated in recent months.

A U.S. warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait in what the American military described as a “routine” passage on Wednesday, but enraging China, which claims sovereignty over the island and surrounding seas.

Ties between Beijing and Washington have deteriorated in recent months, over issues including trade and Hong Kong, with the self-ruled island of Taiwan a long-running source of tension.

The guided-missile destroyer USS Barry passed through the Strait on October 14, according to a statement by the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

“The ship’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the statement said.

“The U.S. Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,” it added.

Any U.S. Navy operations in the Taiwan Strait, which separates China from the island, provoke a strong response from Beijing, which considers Taiwan to be an inviolable part of its territory.

In an angry riposte, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army said it tracked the USS Barry by sea and air “throughout the entire process”.

“We warn the U.S. to stop its words and deeds that provoke trouble and disturb the situation in the Taiwan Strait,” Eastern Theatre Command spokesperson Colonel Zhang Chunhui said.

The island has been governed separately since the end of a civil war in China in 1949.

Taiwan has its own flag, currency and military, but it is not recognised as an independent nation by the United Nations.

Washington ended its diplomatic relations with Taipei in 1979 in order to improve ties with China, but the U.S. remains the island’s most powerful ally and its main arms supplier.

The Chinese have threatened to use force if Taipei proclaims independence or if there is foreign intervention.

Beijing views the passage of foreign vessels through the Strait as a violation of its sovereignty.

Washington and many other countries, on the other hand, see the waterway as part of international waters and therefore open to all.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ke37u9/article31615457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-USFLAGS-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-tracks-us-navy-ships-passage-through-taiwan-strait/article32862031.ece
20,2020/10/15,LGBT groups in Japan launch petition seeking equality law,"Sexual minority groups and human rights activists launched a petition on Thursday calling for an LGBT equality law in Japan in hopes that it can be enacted next year, when the country is to host the Olympics and will be the focus of international attention.

“In this country, equal rights for LGBT people are not guaranteed by law or in their social lives,” said Yuri Igarashi, co-representative of the Japan Alliance for LGBT Legislation, one of several organisers of the petition.

“We call for the passage of an LGBT equality law in time for the Tokyo games, and as an Olympic legacy.”

Japan has slowly shown an increased awareness of sexual diversity but it is often superficial. Pressure to conform still forces many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people to hide their sexual identities, even from their families.

Same-sex marriage is not legally allowed, and transgender people are required to remove their reproductive organs to have sex changes reflected in official documents — a requirement that international medical experts and human rights groups criticize as inhumane.

Recently, a local assemblyman in Tokyo belonging to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s conservative governing party sparked outrage after linking LGBT people to the country’s declining birthrate, saying constituents in his ward would go extinct if sexual minorities are protected.

Fumino Sugiyama, a transgender activist and former Olympian in women’s fencing, joined a news conference announcing the start of the petition. He said he was unable to disclose his sexual identity when he was competing about 15 years ago because of fear of discrimination.

Last year, Shiho Shimoyamada, a soccer player for the Japanese women’s football club Sfida Setagaya, disclosed that she has a same-sex partner, becoming the first prominent Japanese athlete to do so.

“In sports, you often have to hide who you really are, and in this environment you can’t really feel safe and enjoy sports,” Shimoyamada said Thursday, referring to bullying and harassment targeted at sexual minorities. I have high expectations that an equality law can create an environment where people can speak up when they face discrimination.

Japan ranks among the lowest among OECD countries in LGBT equality, and does not even have a population estimate for sexual minorities, according to Yumiko Murakami, head of the OECD Tokyo Center.

Representatives of the groups sponsoring the petition said they plan to submit it to national lawmakers for parliamentary discussion and enactment next year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2p4i7k/article32862000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAPANOLYMPICSLGBTQRIGHTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lgbt-groups-in-japan-launch-petition-seeking-equality-law/article32862003.ece

Kyrgyzstan President Sooronbai Jeenbekov announced his resignation on Thursday in a bid to end the turmoil that has engulfed the Central Asian nation after a disputed parliamentary election.

In a statement released by his office, Mr. Jeenbekov, who has faced calls to step down from protesters and political opponents, said holding on to power wasn’t worth the integrity of our country and agreement in society.

The Hindu Explains | What’s happening in Kyrgyzstan?

“For me, peace in Kyrgyzstan, the country’s integrity, the unity of our people and calm in the society are above all else,” Mr. Jeenbekov said.

Kyrgyzstan, a country of 6.5 million people located on the border with China, was plunged into chaos following an October 4 vote that election officials say was swept by pro-government parties. The opposition said the election was tainted by vote-buying and other irregularities.

Protesters then took over government buildings, looting some offices and the Central Election Commission nullified the election. Opposition then announced plans to oust Mr. Jeenbekov and form a new government.

The announcement Thursday came just a day after Mr. Jeenbekov dismissed a demand to step down from the country’s new Prime Minister, saying he would stay on the job until the political situation in the Central Asian country stabilises.

The President had insisted earlier that stepping down could trigger unpredictable developments to the detriment of the state, his office said. It emphasized that he will only agree to resign after he takes the country back into the legal field, after holding parliamentary and calling presidential elections.

22,2020/10/15,Twitter locks White House Press Secretary’s personal account,"Move comes in the wake of the Secretary sharing a report alleging corruption by Joe Biden’s son.

Twitter locked the personal account of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany after she shared a news report regarding alleged corruption by the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, President Donald Trump has said.

Mr. Trump and his campaign alleged that this was because of a story from the New York Post which made allegations against Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden that he leveraged access to his father in exchange for payments through his position on the board of a Ukraine company.

Twitter has locked the personal account of White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany for sharing news Democrats don’t like, the Trump campaign tweeted.

Addressing an election rally in the battleground state of Iowa, Mr. Trump said, “They closed down her account. She’s the White House press secretary. Because she’s reporting the truth, they closed down her account. So let’s see what’s going to happen. We’ve just learned through explosive documents published by a very fine newspaper, the New York Post that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings.”

“And this is a big, smoking gun. The newly uncovered e-mails revealed that a top executive from the highly questionable Ukrainian company, it’s an energy company, which paid Hunter at least $50,000 a month but it’s now looking like it could be $183,000 a month and that’s a lot of money,” he alleged.

Despite the fact that he had absolutely no experience and knew nothing about energy, he wrote to Mr. Hunter, arranging for a meeting to meet with former Vice President Joe Biden, he claimed.

“The same Ukrainian energy executive even sent Mr. Hunter an email saying ‘we urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence’ In other words, Mr. Hunter was being paid for access to his Vice President father who was specifically put in charge of Ukraine and Russia,” he alleged.

On her official White House account, Ms. McEnany tweeted censorship should be condemned and that it was not the American way .

Attacking the former Vice President, Mr. Trump said that the e-mails published by New York Post shows that Mr. Biden’s repeated claim that he has never spoken to Mr. Hunter about his business dealings were a “lie“.

“Was a total lie. He lied to you over and over cause he’s trying to cover up a massive pay-for-play scandal at the heart of his vice presidency. And everybody knows it. Everybody in Washington knows it,” he said.

“We’ve known it for a long time. The fact is, there was never an administration more corrupt than the Obama-Biden administration. Just weeks ago, Joe stood before the American people in a presidential debate and told you that these claims had been totally discredited and that his son did nothing wrong. But now that turns out to be a total lie. Now we can see clearly that Mr. Biden is a corrupt politician who shouldn’t even be allowed to run for the presidency,” he said.

Mr. Trump alleged that he was pressing Mr. Biden to tell the truth because “the corrupt mainstream media refused to write the story“.

Mr. Trump earlier threatened to remove protections for tech platforms after Twitter and Facebook censored The New York Post’s reporting of e-mails from Hunter Biden.

Twitter announced earlier that it was taking action to block any URLs, links, images or material by removing tweets that violated its Hacked Materials Policy .

In a tweet later in the evening, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said that the move to block the New York Post article on alleged e-mails on Hunter Biden’s laptop was “unacceptable“.

“Our communication around our actions on the @nypost article was not great. And blocking URL sharing via tweet or DM with zero context as to why we’re blocking: unacceptable,” he said in a tweet.

Twitter in a series of tweets gave its explanation. “We want to provide much needed clarity around the actions we’ve taken with respect to two NY Post articles that were first tweeted this morning,” it said.

The images contained in the articles include personal and private information - like email addresses and phone numbers - which violate our rules, Twitter said, adding that it is also currently viewing materials included in the articles as violations of its Hacked Materials Policy.

“We know we have more work to do to provide clarity in our product when we enforce our rules in this manner. We should provide additional clarity and context when preventing the tweeting or DMing of URLs that violate our policies,” Twitter said.

“The policy, established in 2018, prohibits the use of our service to distribute content obtained without authorisation. We don’t want to incentivise hacking by allowing Twitter to be used as distribution for possibly illegally obtained materials,” it said.

Noah Mansker, a business reporter with the New York Post said that the daily’s Twitter account has also been locked because the Hunter Biden stories violate its rules against “distribution of hacked material.”

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s son, Donald J Trump Jr., released a video, attacking the Biden family, calling it the “most corrupt political family” in the American history.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/30dutd/article31761640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kayleigh-McEnany,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twitter-locks-white-house-press-secretarys-personal-account/article32860160.ece
23,2020/10/15,India re-elected as president of International Solar Alliance,"India and France were re-elected as the president and co- president of the ISA for a term of two years at the virtual meeting of the third ISA assembly.

India and France were re-elected as president and co-president of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) for a term of two years at its third assembly on Wednesday, an official statement said.

The Third Assembly of the ISA was attended by 34 members’ ministers. As many as 53 member countries and five signatory and prospective member countries participated in the assembly, the ministry of new and renewable energy said.

India and France were re-elected as the president and co- president of the ISA for a term of two years at the virtual meeting of the third ISA assembly.

Four new vice-presidents were also chosen to represent the four regions of the ISA.

The representatives of Fiji and Nauru for Asia Pacific Region; Mauritius and Niger for Africa Region; UK and the Netherlands for Europe and Others Region; and Cuba and Guyana for Latin America and Caribbean Region assumed the vice presidency.

The assembly also approved the initiatives of the ISA Secretariat in institutionalising ISA’s engagement with the private and public corporate sector through the Coalition for Sustainable Climate Action (CSCA), it said.

Ten public sector organisations in India presented a cheque for $1 million each at the assembly.

Speaking in the plenary, the President of the ISA assembly and India’s Power and New and Renewable Energy Minister R.K. Singh said solar energy has come a long way in the last five years and is now the fastest growing energy source globally.

“Solar energy is already contributing around 2.8% of global electricity, and if trends were to continue, by 2030, solar will become most important source of energy for electricity production in large part of the world,” he added.

He said six programmes and two projects are now underway covering various aspects of solar energy.

A robust pipeline of more than $5 billion has been developed for solar energy applications to meet lighting, irrigation, drinking water and productive energy requirements of the ISA member countries, which have so far been largely deprived of modern energy services.

The ISA has aggregated a demand for more than 270,000 solar pumps across 22 countries, more than 1 GW of solar rooftop across 11 countries, and more than 10 GW of solar mini-grids across nine countries under its respective programmes.

The Co-President of the Assembly Barbara Pompili, France’s Minister for Ecological Transition, reiterated France’s involvement — pointing out that of the 1.5 billion euros of financing the country has committed for solar projects in ISA member states up until 2022, 1.15 billion euros has been committed to concrete projects.

France has also supported the collaboration with the World Bank to mobilise financing. A facility ‘Sustainable Renewables Risk Mitigation Initiative’ (SRMI) should help mobilize 18 billion euros in private investment to finance more than 10 gigawatts of solar projects. The first project is being launched in Mozambique with the support of France and the European Union.

She further announced that under the framework of the ISA Star-C programme, the French National Institute for Solar Energy (INES) will very soon launch a specific program for the small island states of the Pacific.

The ISA assembly was also presented with the report prepared by the World Resources Institute (WRI).

The report identifies the sources of funds, opportunities and constraints, in scaling up solar investments and the contribution of ISA in assisting member countries.

The assembly welcomed the move of the ISA to work with WRI to develop a roadmap for mobilisation of $1 trillion by 2030.

The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bloomberg New Energy Finance and Climate Works Foundation providing the required financial and technical assistance for preparation of the roadmap.

The roadmap will also analyse the potential for mobilising further investments in solar energy going beyond solar power projects to solar energy applications in transportation and cooling and heating and for implementing the vision of ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid’

In the wake of the global pandemic, ISA responded by setting up ISA CARES, an initiative dedicated to deployment of solar energy in the healthcare sector. The initiative aims to solarise one primary health sector in each district of target member countries.

Australia has provided AUD 92,000 for the ISA CARES initiative in the Pacific to provide ongoing reliable solar energy for health centres in the region, helping remote island communities reduce reliance on costly and uncertain diesel fuel imports.

Other initiatives presented to the assembly were the demand aggregation initiative for 47 million solar home systems and 250 million LED lamps in ISA member countries launched in August 2020.

The membership of the ISA has continued to grow since the Second Assembly in 2019. The ISA is now supported by 68 member countries, and a further 20 countries are in the process of becoming members.

The ISA is an initiative that was launched by the Prime Minister of India and the President of France on November 30, 2015 in Paris on the side-lines of the COP-21.

The overarching objective of the ISA is to collectively address key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy in ISA member countries.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ygetwg/article32859815.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/solaralliancejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/india-re-elected-as-president-of-international-solar-alliance/article32859827.ece
24,2020/10/15,Thailand declares emergency after unprecedented protest,"Thai police disperses protesters outside PM’s office.

Thai authorities declared a strict new state of emergency for the capital on Thursday, a day after a student-led protest against the country’s traditional establishment saw an extraordinary moment in which demonstrators heckled a royal motorcade.

After the pre-dawn declaration, riot police moved in to clear out demonstrators who after a day of rallies and confrontation had gathered outside Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s office to push their demands, which include the former general’s stepping down, constitutional changes and reform of the monarchy.

Several top leaders of the protest movement were taken into custody, with one later declaring on his Facebook page that he had been denied access to a lawyer and was being forced onto a helicopter and taken to a city in the country’s north.

Police said they had made 22 arrests.

The text of the emergency declaration said it was needed because certain groups of perpetrators intended to instigate an untoward incident and movement in the Bangkok area by way of various methods and via different channels, including causing obstruction to the royal motorcade.

The protest Wednesday in Bangkok’s historic district, not far from glittering temples and royal palaces, was the third major gathering by student-led activists who have been pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable — and legal — language by publicly questioning the role of Thailand’s monarchy in the nation’s power structure.

Thailand’s royal family has long been considered sacrosanct and a pillar of Thai identity. King Maha Vajiralongkorn and other key member of the royal family are protected by a lese majeste law that has regularly been used to silence critics who risk up to 15 years in prison if deemed to have insulted the institution.

The protest — held on the anniversary of a 1973 student-led uprising against a military dictatorship — was complicated by the presence of royalist counter protesters who had gathered both to show support for the government and to greet the royal family as they travelled to and from a religious ceremony in the area.

That led to a moment captured in photos and video that circulated widely on social media in which what appeared to be protesters gestured and shouted just meters (feet) from the royal motorcade. Such actions are unprecedented in Thailand, where those waiting for a royal motorcade regularly sit on the ground or prostrate themselves.

Some experts say a line may have been crossed.

""What seemed to be a low-boil stalemate that the Prayuth government was managing with reasonable success has now, following the incident involving the procession of the queen’s motorcade down a street in which an active protest was under way and the arrests of protest leaders, become a full-blown crisis,” said Michael Montesano, coordinator of the Thailand Studies Program at the ISEAS-Yusof Isak Institute in Singapore.

“Unlike even 48 hours ago, the country is in dangerous territory now."" Government spokesman Anucha Buraphachaisri announced Thursday morning that the prime minister had ordered police to take strict action against those who obstruct a royal procession or otherwise insult the monarchy.

Keeping order will be facilitated by the new emergency decree for Bangkok, which bans unauthorized gatherings of more than five people and gives authorities other powers they deem needed to prevent unrest, including detaining people at length without charge. It also outlaws the news that distorts information or could cause a misunderstanding.

Thailand is already under a national state of emergency as part of its efforts to fight the coronavirus, and it was not immediately clear how the new decree was different.

One change is that police said they will install checkpoints around Bangkok for security purposes.

Protesters were undaunted and said they would gather again in a Bangkok shopping district Thursday afternoon.

Deputy police spokesman Col. Kissana Phathanacharoen warned that calling for such a protest or attending one was against the law.

You cannot say that they are not aware of the order. We are making it clear, Kissana said at a news conference Human rights group Amnesty International criticized the crackdown. Its deputy regional director Ming Yu Hah urged Thai authorities to engage in constructive dialogue with the protesters.

""The scale of today’s early morning arrests seems completely unjustified based on yesterday’s events. The assemblies were overwhelmingly peaceful.

These moves are clearly designed to stamp out dissent, and sow fear in anyone who sympathises with the protesters’ views,"" the group said in a statement.

The protest movement was launched in March by university students, but quickly put on hold as Thailand was gripped by the coronavirus pandemic. It came back in July, when the threat from the virus eased, and since grown in size.

The movement’s original core demands were new elections, changes in the constitution to make it more democratic, and an end to intimidation of activists.

The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule and passed in a referendum in which campaigning against it was illegal is undemocratic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/necp2u/article32859799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AP15-10-2020000019B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thai-police-disperse-protesters-outside-pms-office/article32859800.ece
25,2020/10/15,"Will provide citizenship to 11 million people if voted to power, says Joe Biden","Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has vowed to provide citizenship to 11 million illegal immigrants if voted to power in the November 3 presidential elections.

Mr. Biden identified this as one of his priorities in addition to beating the virus, rebuilding the economy and figuring out how to restore American leadership around the world.

Responding to a question at a virtual fund raiser on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said there is a need to deal with what’s going on at the border.

“We’re going to have to deal with the immigration crisis we have. I’m going to send the House and Senate an immigration bill that’s going to provide access to citizenship to 11 million people,” he said.

According to the campaign, there were 37 attendees and the event was hosted by Jane Hartley, former U.S. Ambassador to France and Monaco and current Chairman, Sesame Workshop; Blair Effron, Founder & Partner, Centerview Partners; Indian American Deven Parekh, Managing Director, Insight Partners and Roger Altman, Founder & Senior Chairman, Evercore.

When asked how he would envision his first 30 days in office in terms of both domestic and foreign policy, Mr. Biden said: “A lot more can go wrong between now and January 21, and I’m not being facetious. Four more years, we’re not going to have the country we have now.”

If the American people elect me, we’re going to have an enormous task in repairing the damage he’s done, he added of Mr. Trump.

We have to be beating the virus, rebuilding the economy and figuring out how to restore American leadership around the world, Mr. Biden said.

Mr. Biden said he would move to quickly implement his plan to deal with the pandemic and reopen safely.

The Democratic presidential candidate also made a note of the challenges facing the so-called Z Generation, the very young.

They’ve really gotten screwed since they got out of school, Mr. Biden said.

The jobs aren’t there, he said.

But guess what? They’re the most open, progressive and the brightest generation we’ve ever had, he added.

And we have to embrace them. They know the change we need to make and how we need to be much more, much more integrated in everything we do, he said.

Mr. Biden was critical of the policies of President Donald Trump.

“The rest of the world is wondering, what in the Lord’s name is happening? What we’re living through today is not normal,” he said.

He reiterated his attacks on Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, noting more than 2,15,000 Americans have died, and criticised the President for backing away from stimulus talks.

“He didn’t walk away. He never was part of ‘em,” Mr. Biden said.

“Three days later, after he said he was walking away, he said he’s coming back. One day, he’s tweeting that the relief package is too big next day it’s too small. The longer he’s President, the more reckless he gets,” he added.

While talking more broadly about the stakes of the election, Mr. Biden noted he just got off the phone with Warren Buffett.

“We have to refuse to postpone what America has to do, the work we have to do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity for God’s sake,” Mr. Biden said.

“Just got off the phone with Warren Buffett and talking about how we’re in a position, unlike we were 50, 70, 80 years ago, to lead the whole damn world in a way that no one else can. There’s no limit to America’s future.

28,2020/10/15,U.S. elections: Joe Biden raises record $383 million in September,"He raised the money in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden raised $383 million for his election effort in September, a record-breaking sum that eclipses the unprecedented fundraising from the previous month.

The haul, announced Wednesday night, leaves him with $432 million in the bank just weeks before the November 3 election.

He raised the money in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee.

The gobs of cash Mr. Biden has raised since securing the nomination amount to a complete reversal in fortune for the former Vice President.

During the Democratic primary, he struggled to raise cash and was almost broke by the time he won the South Carolina primary, which catapulted him to a commanding Super Tuesday performance.

In the months since, a flood of donations and low spending has enabled him to eclipse President Donald Trump’s once-formidable cash reserves. Biden’s campaign and the DNC raised $364 million in August.

In the tweet announcing his September haul, Mr. Biden thanked his supporters and said he was humbled.

He added: There’s still more work to be done, but I wanted to share the good news.

29,2020/10/15,Russia approves 2nd coronavirus vaccine after early trials,"The peptide-based, two-shot vaccine, EpiVacCorona, was developed by the Vector Institute in Siberia

Russian authorities have given regulatory approval to a second coronavirus vaccine after early-stage studies, two months after a similar move prompted widespread criticism from scientists both at home and abroad.

Watch | All about Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine

Russian President Vladimir Putin made the announcement on Wednesday, during a televised meeting with government officials.

“We now need to increase production of the first vaccine and the second vaccine,: Mr. Putin said, adding that the priority was to supply the Russian market with the vaccines.

The peptide-based, two-shot vaccine, EpiVacCorona, was developed by the Vector Institute in Siberia and tested among 100 volunteers in early-stage, placebo-controlled human trials, which lasted more than two months and were completed two weeks ago. The volunteers were between 18 and 60 years old.

The scientists have yet to publish the results of the study. In comments to the media, scientists developing the vaccine said that it produced enough antibodies to protect the person who had it from the virus and that the immunity it creates could last for up to six months.

The Hindu Explains | What do we know about Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate Sputnik V?

An advanced study involving tens of thousands of volunteers that is necessary to establish safety and effectiveness of the vaccine was scheduled to start in November or December.

Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, who said earlier this week she took part in the early trials as a volunteer, said Wednesday that 40,000 people will take part in the advance studies of EpiVacCorona. It remained unclear whether the vaccine would be offered for a wider use while the trials are still ongoing.

Russia’s first vaccine, Sputnik V, was developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute and approved by the government on Aug. 11, after early trials among 76 volunteers were completed. Just like on Wednesday, Mr. Putin personally broke the news on national television and said one of his daughters had already been vaccinated, experienced slight side effects and developed antibodies.

As Russia boasted about being the first in the world to approve a vaccine, experts said that in line with established scientific protocol, much broader studies among tens of thousands of people were needed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine before it is given widely.

Russian health authorities announced advanced trials of Sputnik V among 40,000 volunteers two weeks after it received government approval. Officials also said that vaccination of risk groups, such as doctors and teachers, will be carried out in parallel to the studies.

Ms. Golikova said Wednesday that 13,000 volunteers have so far enrolled in the studies of the Sputnik V vaccine.

The international criticism didn’t stop Russia from promoting Sputnik V abroad. Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund that bankrolled the effort, said last month that the fund already has agreements with Mexico, India and Brazil, which ordered a total of 200 million doses, and dozens of other countries are interested in getting the vaccine.

Speaking at this year’s U.N. General Assembly, Mr. Putin offered to provide the Sputnik-V vaccine to U.N. staff for free. He described the offer as a response to popular demand: Some colleagues from the U.N. have asked about this, and we will not remain indifferent to them. Russia has the world’s fourth largest coronavirus caseload with over 1.3 million infections. It has also reported over 23,000 deaths.

The outbreak in the country appeared to slow down in the summer, but the number of new infections started to grow rapidly last month. Over the past 11 days, Russian health officials have been reporting over 10,000 new cases every day. They registered a record number of 14,231 new cases on Wednesday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/159f8y/article31985664.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PUTIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russia-approves-2nd-coronavirus-vaccine-after-early-trials/article32858693.ece
30,2020/10/15,USFDA approves 1st treatment for Ebola,"Regeneron’s treatment is a combination of three antibodies that work by killing the virus.

The The Food and Drug Administration Wednesday approved the first drug for the treatment of Ebola.

The US regulator okayed the drug developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for treating adults and children. It was tested during an outbreak in Congo that killed nearly 2,300 people before it ended in June.

The drug, named Inmazeb (IN’-meh-zehb), dramatically increased survival in study participants, compared to three other treatments. The study was ended ahead of schedule last year so patients could get Inmazeb or a second drug that was nearly as effective.

Regeneron’s treatment is a combination of three antibodies that work by killing the virus.

Seeking U.S. approval first is a common strategy for drugmakers developing treatments for diseases mainly found in the tropics and in developing countries.

The FDA’s action will make it easier for Regeneron to get approval or allow emergency use during outbreaks in African countries, where the approval process is not straightforward, said Leah Lipsich, who heads Regeneron’s global program for infectious diseases.

The U.S. government, which helped fund the drug’s development, will buy thousands of doses over the next six years to go into the Strategic National Stockpile. Ebola cases are rare in the U.S., but occasionally are diagnosed in travelers returning from areas with an outbreak.

Facebook shut down the page of a fringe New Zealand political party on Thursday, days before a general election, for sharing what the company called misinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The newly formed Advance NZ Party's page was taken off because of “repeated violations” of Facebook's policy on misinformation about the virus that could lead to imminent physical harm, Facebook said in a statement.

“We have clear policies against this type of content and will enforce on these policies regardless of anyone’s political position or party affiliation,” it said.

Advance NZ said Facebook's action was “election interference”.

This is a cynical example of election interference by an American-owned social media outlet that has no business performing any such operation in our sovereign nation,” party co-leader Billy Te Kahika said in a statement.

The party has stirred controversy with an anti-vaccination stance and has also called for an end to coronavirus lockdowns. It has said the case fatality rate of the virus is “not unlike that of seasonal influenza”.

Advance NZ is seen getting about 1% of the vote, according to the latest opinion poll, which would mean it will have no impact on the election outcome.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who also leads the and Labour Party, is seeking a second term in the October 17 polls on the back of her success in eliminating the coronavirus in the country of 5 million with lockdowns and social distancing.

On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters ridiculed a question from another coronavirus sceptic at an election campaign event.

Peters, the leader of the New Zealand First party, was answering questions when an unidentified man asked “where is your evidence that there is a virus that causes this disease?”

“Here's someone who gets up and says 'the Earth is flat',” Peters responded. “Sorry sunshine, wrong place.”

34,2020/10/15,Coronavirus | YouTube bans vaccine misinformation,"The video platform said it would now ban any content with claims about COVID-19 vaccines that contradict consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization

Alphabet Inc's YouTube said on Wednesday it would remove videos from YouTube containing misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, expanding its current rules against falsehoods and conspiracy theories about the pandemic.

The video platform said it would now ban any content with claims about COVID-19 vaccines that contradict consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization.

YouTube said in an email that this would include removing claims that the vaccine will kill people or cause infertility, or that microchips will be implanted in people who receive the vaccine.

A YouTube spokesman told Reuters that general discussions in videos about “broad concerns” over the vaccine would remain on the platform.

YouTube says it already removes content that disputes the existence or transmission of COVID-19, promotes medically unsubstantiated methods of treatment, discourages people from seeking medical care or explicitly disputes health authorities' guidance on self-isolation or social distancing.

Conspiracy theories and misinformation about the new coronavirus vaccines have proliferated on social media during the pandemic, including through anti-vaccine personalities on YouTube and through viral videos shared across multiple platforms.

Although drugmakers and researchers are working on various treatments, vaccines are at the heart of the long-term fight to stop the new coronavirus, which has killed more than a million people, infected more than 38 million and crippled the global economy.

In its email, YouTube said it had removed over 2,00,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading COVID-19 information since early February.

Andy Pattison, manager of digital solutions at the World Health Organization, told Reuters that the WHO meets weekly with the policy team at YouTube to discuss content trends and potentially problematic videos. Pattison said the WHO was encouraged by YouTube's announcement on coronavirus vaccine misinformation.

The company also said it was limiting the spread of COVID-19 related misinformation on the site, including certain borderline videos about COVID-19 vaccines. A spokesman declined to provide examples of such borderline content.

YouTube said it would be announcing more steps in the coming weeks to emphasize authoritative information about COVID-19 vaccines on the site.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/6fj5bt/article32859935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15NETYOUTUBE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/youtube-bans-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation/article32859936.ece

Amid reports of differences in the Congress party over candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections, the Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) released a joint list of candidates for all 243 seats in the State late on Thursday night.

The Congress’s list of 70 candidates had the names of Luv Sinha, son of Bollywood actor and two-time BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha, from Bankipur (Patna), and Ms. Suhasini Raj Rao, daughter of Loktantrik Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav, from Bihariganj (Madhepura).

Expected names

Among others in the list are Chandan Yadav from Beldaur, M.A. Usmani from Jale, Ajit Sharma from Bhagalpur, Kali Pandey from Kuchaikot and Amita Bhushan from Begusarai constituencies. Most of the names in the list have been doing the rounds in party corridors for the last two days.

Earlier, delay in releasing the names of party candidates, reportedly in the wake of intra-party disagreement, had caused embarrassment to the top party leadership. It was also said that the delay was rocking the Congress-RJD alliance in Mahagathbandan.

36,2020/10/15,Indosoul’s new track ‘Dwaitamu’ explores the concept of duality,"The Chennai band’s new song offers their own take on saint Thyagaraja’s ‘Dwaitamu Sukama’

A raw yet controlled riff from Vikram Vivekanand’s guitar gets a pick-me-up — first from Ramkumar Kanakarajan’s drums, then Reshwin Nishith’s bass guitar.

The trio’s pulsing energy lasts about 20 seconds, before giving way to a sudden calm. Karthick Iyer’s soothing voice seamlessly steps in, singing saint Thyagaraja’s ‘Dwaitamu Sukama’, to the soft accompaniment of Sumesh Narayanan on the mridangam.

This ebb and flow of energy continues through Indosouls new track ‘Dwaitamu’, titled after saint Thyagaraja’s kriti on duality by the same name.

The song is the first to be released in Indosoul’s fourth album Equilibrium. Guitarist Vikram says the band hopes to release a song each month from now, but clarifies that not all of them will have the philosophical bent of mind that the album title suggests. He adds, “This album has elements of both our first album and our third (Two Sides of Karma). The first album was very feel-good and happy; the third was contemplative.”

This one, he says, will be a bit of both: “You can talk about balance in so many ways — both musical and non-musical — especially considering what’s happening around us now.”

Karthick, vocalist and violinist, elaborates, “This song marries the philosophy of the album, with what saint Thyagaraja talks about in ‘Dwaitamu Sukama’: the Hindu concept of duality and non-duality.”

The track, like all seven tracks in the album, can be traced back to a weekend in Puducherry that the band spent together in the summer of 2019. Says Karthick, “We decided to just jam for five days. The sessions were open-ended, with no ideas built beforehand. We tried to not get caught up in any one idea; every session had to be a different one. We came up with seven different ideas.”

The band then took their time deliberating with each, coordinating virtually once the pandemic hit. Vikram points out, “We were lucky that everyone in the band has a recording setup at home. We were able to work using the reference track recorded in Pondy.”

The video was shot largely at home. Drone footage of empty Chennai roads form the opening shot — “These were taken in the beginning of lockdown, when there was hardly anyone on the streets,” says Vikram. More such shots, interspersed with each member playing on his own against a black backdrop, form the rest of the video.

How similar or different will the next track be? All Karthick shares is its story of origin. “We had a performance at Sir Mutha Venkata Subbarao auditorium, years ago. During the sound check then, we were jamming and came up with something. We recorded it and hoped to use it later. Inspiration usually strikes on impulse, when the five of us are in the moment.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/off29p/article32861727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16MPIndosoul,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/indosouls-new-track-dwaitamu-explores-the-concept-of-duality/article32861730.ece
37,2020/10/15,India gears up for virtual Durga Puja celebrations this year,"Video aartis, bhog by delivery and socially distanced pandals mark Durga Puja celebrations this year as the festival raises spirits despite COVID-19

The call of the conch will be heard through headphones. The dhunuchi’s scent — a smoky mix of camphor and coconut husks — will be summoned from memory. Durga Puja celebrations are innovating and adapting to the challenges of COVID-19 to usher in necessary cheer in a difficult year.

CR Park, the bastion of Delhi’s Bengalis, will be unusually quiet this pujo, as will pandals across the country in this year of social distancing. In any other year, they would have seen a footfall of over two lakh daily. This time, of the nearly 10 pujas that take place there, only the one inside the premises of the Kali temple will be held.

In Visakhapatanam, too, prayers are being held in temples Kali instead of pandals — at Waltair Kali Bari and the Kali temple in Visakhapatanam Steel Plant, the site of the city’s prominent Ukkunagaram Durga Puja Committee (UDPC) puja. No devotees will be allowed inside any of the three, however. Pushpanjali will instead be broadcast online.

“All rituals will be followed, Saptami through Navami. We have a partnership with DEN (a popular cable channel) and Tata Sky to stream the morning pujas and evening aartis. You can also watch them on our website, YouTube and Facebook,” says Prodip Ganguly, of the CR Park Kali Mandir Society, echoing the intentions of others across the country.

In Chennai, secretary Jaypal Menon of Dakshin Chennai Prabasi Cultural Association (DCPCA) says the live rituals will be “virtually aired for members who want to experience it from home.” He adds, “Last year, we had a footfall of about 2,500 people each day. This time, however, we are not inviting non-members or even our regular patrons. Association members who are older than 65 and younger than 10 are also being asked to stay home, for their own safety.”

Others, like the Anna Nagar-based Dakshini Society, have multiple plans at hand and are waiting for the next set of Corporation directives before deciding how to proceed. Anindo Pal, member of Visakhapatnam’s Ukkunagaram Durga Puja Committee that hosts over 200 Bengali families every year, says, “In such challenging times of a pandemic, we have to keep our emotions intact and follow the safety protocols. We are planning to live stream the puja so that people can offer pushpanjali from their homes.”

Hyderabad’s puja committees will also be streaming their sessions online — live on social media platforms. Many, like Attar puja committee, are also talking about restricting the number of visitors to 50. Atin Chowdhary, member of Bangiya Sankskriti Sangha, says “Core committee members and the priest make up about 20 people. Controlling people will be a tough job, so we have decided to stream the puja instead. There will be no food stalls, no bhog.”

Mukul Dasgupta, secretary of Chennai’s Dakshini Society echoes this: “We will not be serving bhog. Every year, we bring dhakis (drummers) to make things festive and a thakur (traditional chef) to prepare the traditional bhog, all the way from West Bengal. We provide them housing and take care of their food. But this time, we didn’t want them to travel all the way and be put at risk.”

Not everyone, however, can imagine Durga puja without the bhog. DCPCA is arranging for the meal to be packed in eco-friendly boxes and delivered to members’ home. “It will be cooked by our regular Chennai caterers. After all, food is a big part of puja,” says Menon. In Delhi, those living in a two-kilometre radius from CR Park’s Kali Mandir can book the five-item bhog online. “We have got special four-tier dabba carriers from Mumbai for this purpose,” Ganguly says, adding that the cooks and delivery persons will be tested for COVID-19.

Hoteliers and restaurateurs are also keen on lighting up the celebrations with festive menus and traditional bhog. Hyderabad’s Marigold hotel has a bhog package with khichdi, dalna, begunbhaja (fried brinjal), a selection of toks (Bengali bittersweet dips) and a much-loved ilish (hilsa) selection. The khichdi comes with a smoky flavour, to give the feel of it being cooked at a puja pandal’s firewood kitchen. Chef Partha adds, “We also have five-six Bengali sweets, like nolen gurer payesh and rosogolla.”

Hyderbad’s Mercure hotel is adding a twist. They know Bengalis love radha bollovi (a sizeable puri with a spiced dal filling). They have a compact menu but packed with favourites like chop, devilled eggs, the chicken dak bungalow and the sweet, yellow basundi pulao.

Kathi rolls, Mughlai parathas, ghugni — Visakhapatnam-based Sayantika Adak Ghosh devours it all at the city’s pandals every year. This time, she will be serving them from her home kitchen instead. “This way, I can recreate the festive feel at home for my seven-year-old son,” she says. Sayantika is also busy finishing her Mandala art series of Maa Durga which will be the highlight of this year’s homey Durga Puja for her.

In fact, all around the country this year, celebrations have shifted from the pandals to homes. “In my entire lifetime, I have never seen Durga Puja being celebrated this way,” says Rita Basu, a core committee member of Utsav, that conducts the festival every year at AMCOSA in Visakhapatnam. “We used to start preparing for it from June with rehearsals for cultural programmes and corporate sponsorships.”

But not all cultural programmes are on hold; Chennai’s DCPCA plans to stream those as well, in the absence of a stage and physical audience. “All the performances are being recorded beforehand by the small groups in their own homes and setups,” says Menon.

Chowdhary reiterates from Hyderabad, “Keeping in mind Bengalis’ love for music and cultural activities, the Bangiya Sankskriti Sangha has decided to keep that online as well. So artists will perform from their respective homes and bring home the puja mood.”

About the idol

A lack of food stalls and banner space, however, means a lack of advertising and funds for the idol. Chennai’s DCPCA and Dakshini Society nevertheless are making it a point to support the idol-makers, who arrived in August only to be met with a drop in demand. As Menon points out, “They set out from Kolkata, and in the absence of a direct train to Chennai, took a detour via train and bus to get here. This, even though they were not sure if they would get orders.” Dasgupta reiterates, “We have an idol ordered and ready; how many people we allow during the puja remains to be seen.” Most committees are bringing in the idols on October 21, for celebrations that will run till October 26.

At CR Park, the idol will stand five feet tall instead of the usual 20. In fact, the presence of an idol itself is unusual this year. Ramit Mitra, who conducts pre-puja walks of idol making workshops a month before Ashtami, says, “There are two major idol makers in CR Park who in normal circumstances would have made approximately 40-50 idols, big and small. This time, they are doing maybe five small ones.”

Many have also turned from idols to the ghot (a copper, brass or silver pot) puja: this involves worshipping a representation of the idol, in the form of a coconut in a kalash.

The festivities remain emotionally significant for other reasons. DCPCA, that has been using a closed, air-conditioned venue for years, is moving back to the sprawling grounds where it had its first celebrations in 2013. And for Delhi’s Kashmere Gate puja, this year is historic. It is their 111th puja, shares Som Prakash Mitra, president of the puja committee: “Up until 1911, we would only have ghot puja. And now after 109 years, history is repeating itself.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/k1l3oi/article32862886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16MPDURGAPUJA,https://www.thehindu.com/society/indians-anticipate-virtual-durga-puja-celebrations-this-year/article32862895.ece

43,2020/10/15,Mindtree Q2 net rises 88%to ₹253.7 crore,"`To give out wage increment in January’

IT services firm Mindtree reported an almost 88% year-on-year increase in its second quarter net profit to ₹253.7 crore. Revenue rose 0.6% to ₹1,926 crore.

With India joining six other nations in demanding that tech firms build backdoors to deal with ‘significant challenges to public safety’ posed by end-to-end encryption, a Delhi-based digital rights and liberties advocacy group has filed an RTI plea, raising questions over the move.

In the petition, filed with the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of External Affairs, and Ministry of Electronics and IT, the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF)sought to know if any legal opinion was sought before India became a signatory to the statement and whether the government planned to introduce any legislation pursuant to becoming a signatory. This follows an October 11 joint statement by seven countries — the U.K., the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, India and Japan — urging tech companies to work with governments to find solutions to ensure the safety of citizens, without eroding user privacy or cybersecurity.

45,2020/10/15,IRDAI unveils standard term life insurance cover,"Saral Jeevan Bima a must-offer by Jan. 1

Insurance regulator IRDAI has come up with a standard individual term life insurance product whose simple features as well as standard terms and conditions are expected to help customers make an informed choice and reduce mis-selling.

The product, Saral Jeevan Bima, will be a non-linked, non-participating individual pure risk premium life insurance plan providing for payment of the sum assured in lump sum to the nominee in case of the insured’s death during the policy term. Issuing guidelines, the regulator mandated all life insurers to offer the standard product by January 1. The plan will be for those in the 18-65 years age group.

The policy term will be 5-40 years, while the sum assured will be a minimum of ₹5 lakh and a maximum of ₹25 lakh, IRDAI said. Insurers, however, have the option of offering sum assured beyond ₹25 lakh with all other terms and conditions remaining the same.

The product shall be offered to individuals without restrictions on gender, place of residence, travel, occupation or educational qualifications.

On the death benefit, the regulator said for regular and limited premium payment policies, it will be the highest of 10 times of annualised premium; 105% of all the premiums paid as on the date of death; or the absolute amount assured to be paid on death. In case of single premium policies, it will be higher of 125% of single premium, or absolute amount assured to be paid on death.

There will be no maturity benefit. Neither will there be any surrender value nor can any loan be taken against the product. The pricing (premium) by insurers will be as per the File and Use (F&U) process. On exclusions, the circular said there shall be no exclusions, except suicide.

IRDAI said in the last few years there has been an increased customer preference towards pure term life insurance products resulting in insurers launching many term products with varying terms and conditions. However, “customers who cannot devote adequate time and energy to make informed choices find it difficult to select the right product. Also, products may not be available for the intended sum assured,” it said.

Thus, it was felt necessary to introduce a standard, individual term life insurance product to take care of this situation and to make available a product by all life insurers that broadly meets the needs of an average customer, the regulator said.

Santosh Agarwal, Chief Business Officer, Life Insurance, Policybazaar.com, said just like standard health insurance product Arogya Sanjeevani, the individual term life insurance product will also be the same across all insurers. The product will have the same features, benefits, inclusions and exclusions, but the prices, service level and claim settlement rate may differ. The introduction of Saral Jeevan Bima by IRDAI will be a revolutionary move helping increase life insurance penetration, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/irdai-unveils-standard-term-life-insurance-cover/article32865438.ece
46,2020/10/15,WNS reports higher Q2 profit on lower costs,"WNS (Holdings) Ltd. has reported a slightly higher profit in the fiscal second quarter at $29.2 million compared with $28.7 million in Q2 of last year.

“Year-over-year, profit improvement was the result of lower share-based compensation expense, a one-time reversal of our corporate leave provision, reductions in travel, facility-related and discretionary expenditure and favourable currency movements net of hedging,” the company said in a statement.

The leave provision reversal contributed $4 million to Q2 pre-tax profit, and was the result of a policy change which removed employee’s ability to carry forward unused leave for fiscal 2021.

These benefits more than offset headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic, including revenue reductions, employee carrying costs, and increased business continuity costs, the company said.

In addition, the company recorded a higher effective tax rate versus last year, driven by the geographic mix of profit.

Revenue in the second quarter was $222.6 million, representing a 1.6% decrease versus Q2 of last year.

Revenue less repair payments in the second quarter was $214.4 million, a decrease of 2.9% year-over-year.

Excluding exchange rate impacts, constant currency revenue less repair payments in the fiscal second quarter was down 2.8% versus Q2 of last year.

Year-over-year, fiscal Q2 revenue was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including lower volume requirements from certain clients and service delivery constraints resulting from the transition to a ‘work-from-home’ delivery model, the company said.

These headwinds more than offset the year-over-year growth from new client additions and the expansion of existing relationships, it added.

From a balance sheet perspective, WNS ended Q2 with $366.5 million in cash and investments and $25.1 million of debt.

In the second quarter, the company generated $56.7 million in cash from operations and incurred $6.5 million in capital expenditures.

The company also made scheduled debt payments of $8.4 million.

“In the fiscal second quarter, WNS made solid progress growing our top line, adjusting our cost structure, and ensuring our ability to service clients’ requirements in a difficult business environment,” said Keshav Murugesh, chief executive officer, WNS said.

“We are also pleased that visibility has now improved to the point where the company is comfortable providing annual guidance,” he said.

“Looking forward, while we are seeing some delays in converting larger signed deals into revenue, we are pleased with the overall health of the sales pipeline including new opportunity additions, progress of deals through the pipeline, and contract signings for both new logos and existing client expansions,” he said.

“While we continue to expect some volatility in our business over the next few quarters, we remain confident in our financial strength, differentiated capabilities, underlying business momentum, and proven ability to execute,” the CEO said.

“WNS will continue to focus on ensuring the health and safety of our global employees, securely servicing the needs of our clients, and investing for the expanding BPM opportunity,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/wns-reports-higher-q2-profit-on-lower-costs/article32865118.ece

50,2020/10/15,Coronavirus | Centre issues SOPs for cultural events,"Nod for gatherings of over 100 persons in safe zones

The Ministry of Culture on Thursday issued detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to facilitate organisation of cultural events during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The SOPs are based on the Unlock 5.0 guidelines of the Union Home Ministry and have been finalised after taking into consideration the suggestions received from various stakeholders in the creative industry.

The Ministry clarified that cultural activities would continue to be prohibited inside containment zones. State and Union Territory governments may consider proposing additional measures as per their field assessment.

“These guidelines contain Standard Operating Procedures to be followed by the management of theatres and performance spaces, as well as the entertainment/creative agencies, artists and crew or any other persons who hire the auditoria or any other open/closed performance spaces, whether on payment or gratis,” it said.

The comprehensive guidelines have been issued for artistes and crew; management of green rooms; stage management; costume and make-up trials; sanitisation of venue, including stage, open area seating, etc.

The national directives for COVID-19 management, and relevant guidelines issued by the Ministries of Home Affairs, Health and Family Welfare, and the State/UT governments will have to be strictly complied with during all the activities and operations.

“COVID-19 pandemic has hit the cultural and creative economy all ever the world. However, cultural activities are slowly being resumed. In order to encourage those persons and agencies providing cultural services, as well as consumers of such services, it is important to lay down comprehensive guidelines for resumption of these cultural activities in India,” said the Ministry.

Unlock 4.0 guidelines had allowed social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, sports and religious functions and other congregations with a ceiling of 100 persons, outside containment zones, from September 21, subject to strict adherence to protocols like social distancing and sanitisation.

The Unlock 5.0 guidelines allow congregations beyond the limit of 100 persons, outside the containment zones, after October 15, subject to certain restrictions.

In closed spaces, a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity will be allowed, with a ceiling of 200 persons. Wearing of face masks, maintaining social distancing, provision for thermal scanning, and use of handwash or sanitiser, will be mandatory.

Any gathering in open spaces will be allowed keeping the size of the space or ground in view, and with strict observance of social distancing, mandatory wearing of face masks, provision for thermal scanning and handwash or sanitiser.

51,2020/10/15,"No plan to completely do away with sleeper coaches, says Railway Board chief","Only AC coaches on select routes where trains will run at a speed of 130 kmph or higher, says V.K. Yadav.

Railway Board CEO and Chairman V.K. Yadav on Thursday said while they did not plan to completely do away with sleeper class coaches, only air-conditioned coaches would be used on select routes where trains would run at a speed of 130 kmph or higher.

The Railways has designed a new AC 3-tier coach, which it is currently testing. It will be introduced next year with fares less than current charges for AC 3-tier.

“Sleeper class coaches will continue ... We are in the process of increasing the speeds of our trains to 130 km from 110 km, particularly along the golden diagonal and golden quadrilateral ... when train speeds will be increased due to wind and dust there might be discomfort in sleeper coaches. Hence, we have designed a new AC 3-tier coach … The fare will be kept somewhere in between AC-3 tier and sleeper with the aim that more people can afford travelling in AC coaches,” Mr. Yadav said during a virtual conference.

Goods sheds

Meanwhile, the Railway Ministry released a new policy for development of goods sheds aimed at augmenting terminal capacity through private participation.

Under the policy, private players will be permitted to develop goods wharf, loading/unloading facilities, facilities for labour, approach road, covered shed and other related infrastructure. The facilities will be developed by the private parties through their own investments.

Railways said the facilities would be used as common user facility, and no preference or priority would be granted to the traffic of the party over the traffic of other customers.

As an incentive under the scheme, private players will be given a share in the terminal charges and terminal access charges for five years. The private party can also earn additional revenue through utilisation of available space for establishing small canteen/tea shop, advertisements etc, the Railways said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4a0ilf/article32865344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TH-YADAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-plan-to-completely-do-away-with-sleeper-coaches-says-railway-board-chief/article32865345.ece
52,2020/10/15,"Ladakh standoff | Disengagement talks a work in progress, says Jaishankar","On China’s statements on Arunachal Pradesh and the status of Ladakh as a Union Territory, New Delhi says Beijing has “no locus standi” to comment on India’s internal matters.

India, China talks on disengagement at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) were a “work in progress”, and “confidential” at present, said External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, even as the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) asserted that the two sides now have a “better understanding” of each other’s positions.

“We had a discussion and we agreed on the importance of early disengagement,” Mr. Jaishankar observed at the online Bloomberg India Economic Forum, referring to his meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on September 10.

“Since then, there have been a series of meetings on-site, so to be speak between military commanders assisted by diplomats, which is at present a work in progress, so I can’t comment at present,” he stated.

The MEA said the disengagement process at the LAC was “complex” but gave no indicator of how long it was envisaged to be.

‘Better understanding’

Its spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, “The two sides have a better understanding of each other’s positions. Disengagement is a complex process that requires redeployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC”.

The “current momentum of communications” would continue to ensure that the decision by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping to “not turn differences into disputes” would be followed, he added.

Despite several mechanisms for talks, including seven rounds of face-to-fact meetings of military commanders at the Chushul-Moldo points at the LAC, five rounds of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC), and several conversations at the levels of the two Foreign Ministers, Defence Ministers and Special Representatives, ground reports suggest that Chinese troops have not yet pulled back from positions they had taken along the LAC in the six-month long stand-off, ensuring that Indian troops maintain their counter positions as well.

‘Five-point agreement’

The comments from Mr. Jaishankar and Mr. Srivastava came in response to specific questions being asked about whether the “five-point agreement” between the former and Mr. Wang more than a month ago still remains relevant, with concerns growing about the likelihood of heavy winter deployments in sub-zero temperatures along the LAC in Ladakh.

Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo estimated that China had amassed as many as 60,000 troops on its side of the boundary.

The seriousness of the situation at the border could not be minimised, Mr. Jaishankar said.

“After 45 years, we have had military casualties at the border, and there is a troop build-up which in many ways has no precedent in the recent past”, he said when asked what were the biggest foreign policy challenges for India. “For me, the real issue is whether a rising China and a rising India can find an equilibrium”.

Statements on Arunachal

Dismissing Chinese statements on Arunachal Pradesh and the status of Ladakh as a Union Territory, the MEA said that China had “no locus standi” to comment on India’s internal matters.

“We hope that countries will not comment on India’s internal matters, as much as they expect the same of others. This fact has also been clearly conveyed to the Chinese side on several occasions, including at the highest level,” Mr. Srivastava told journalists, referring to both issues, on Thursday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e452zs/article32865411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LADAKHjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lac-withdrawal-talks-are-a-work-in-progress-jaishankar/article32865217.ece
53,2020/10/15,Meira Kumar says Facebook unblocked her official page after protests,"Former Lok Sabha Speaker accuses social media giant of ‘assault on democracy’ in the middle of Bihar election campaign

Former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar on Thursday said Facebook India unblocked her official page after facing protests over their move just before the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections.

In a tweet earlier, the former Lok Sabha Speaker had accused the social media giant of carrying an “assault on democracy” by blocking her page in the middle of the Bihar election campaign. Ms. Kumar is a senior Congress leader from Bihar and a member of the party’s panel on election management in the State.

“Facebook page BLOCKED! Crushing the voice of Opposition - an assault on democracy. It cannot be a mere coincidence that Facebook blocks my page just before the Bihar elections,” Ms. Kumar said on Twitter in the afternoon, and shared a screenshot of her Facebook page that said: “Your page has been unpublished.”

Soon after Ms. Kumar raised the issue, several Congress leaders took to Twitter to accuse Facebook of trying to “stifle” the Opposition’s voice.

“We witnessed as to how #Facebook India leadership was compromised by Modi Govt as subservient to its agenda. Now blocking the account of Former Speaker & a leading light of @INCIndia proves that petty tactics are being used to stifle the voice of Opposition leaders,” Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.

Party spokesperson Pawan Khera, who heads the media panel on Bihar elections, tagged Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and asked if “it was the result of a coalition between BJP and Facebook India”.

Following an investigative report in a well-known international publication that claimed Facebook India was biased towards the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress had not only written to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg but had also demanded a Parliamentary probe into Facebook India’s functioning.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xhno94/article32864773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MEIRAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/meira-kumar-says-facebook-unblocked-her-official-page-after-protests/article32864774.ece
54,2020/10/15,Shopian encounter: Army to complete recording of statements in 10 days,"As soon as CoI gives its recommendations, the summary of evidence recording, a precursor to court martial proceedings, will start

The Army’s Court of Inquiry (CoI) into Operation Amshipora in Shopian, in which three terrorists were killed and the Army had accepted there were excesses, would complete recording statements within the next 10 days and action taken as per the recommendations, said Maj. Gen. Rashim Bali, General Officer Commanding of the Victor Force covering South Kashmir under 15 Corps, said on Thursday.

“As on today, the statements of 70%, or perhaps more, of all the essential witnesses have already been recorded. The only people left are those who not here locally. I am very certain that within a week or perhaps 10 days, the proceedings will be over. The officer concerned has been put in close arrest in a different unit,” Maj. Gen. Bali told a small group of journalists. “Whatever has to happen as per the right tenets of the law will happen”.

Police probe also on

As soon as the CoI gave its recommendations, the summary of evidence recording, a precursor to court martial proceedings, would start. Police investigation into the criminology part was simultaneously on.

Maj. Gen. Bali said that within 20 days of the incident, an advertisement was placed in the media stating that anyone who had information should come forward. Within one week, the CoI was constituted and within 10-15 days, it had established that prima facie there was a case of violation of the Army’s code of conduct. “We are clear that our code of conduct has been flouted,” he stated.

The nature of the excesses would be determined by the inquiry. The Army and its Chief were absolutely clear that “any act of negligence by omission or commission will be addressed.” “It will not be overlooked,” he asserted.

Last month the Army said an inquiry ordered into the Shopian encounter of July 18 concluded that during the operation, the powers vested under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) “were exceeded” and the “do’s and dont’s of the Chief of the Army Staff [COAS] as approved by the Supreme Court have been contravened.” The inquiry was ordered after three families from the Pir Panjal valley's Rajouri district claimed that the three killed were their kin and labourers by profession.

The inquiry would determine if the officer had to be blamed or if he had some accomplices who have waylaid him. The moment it came out whosoever had done whatsoever, they would get their due.

Minimum use of force

On the situation in south Kashmir, Maj. Gen. Bali said that while local terror recruitment was on the rise, they were untrained and the Army was taking measures to dissuade the local youth. During operations, the Army was now holding cordons all night, if required. “We are advocating minimum use of force and minimum collateral damage to avoid loss of lives and damage to property”. As part of an outreach advocated by the 15 Corps Commander, they were now taking civilians to Army’s Company Operating Bases (COB), he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/71s8bh/article32640706.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHOPIANENCOUNTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shopian-encounter-army-to-complete-statements-recording-within-10-days/article32864204.ece
55,2020/10/15,"Kabir Kala Manch’s plays, songs led to violence, death at Bhima Koregaon: NIA","Central agency files third chargesheet, says banned CPI (Maoist) misled Dalits

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) said, “Activists of Kabir Kala Manch (KKM) were making objectionable statements about history which were detrimental to the social harmony and they were playing street plays, singing objectionable songs which led to stone pelting, violence, arson and death in the area of Koregaon Bhima.”

The Central agency filed its second supplementary chargesheet in the Bhima Koregaon violence that took place during a programme at Shaniwar Pada, Pune organised on December 31, 2017 under the banner of ‘Elgar Parishad’. Some performers enacted short plays, danced and sang. According to the NIA, the banned organisation Communist Party of India (Maoist) had an organisational role in the programme “to implicate strong Maoist thoughts in the depressed classes to turn them towards unconstitutional violent activities”.

The three chargesheets filed in the case have no mention of Hindutva leaders Milind Ekbote, executive president of an outfit called Samastha Hindu Aghadi; and Sambhaji Bhide ‘Guruji’, who heads an outfit called Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan. Their names were registered on the basis of an eyewitness account that they had incited violence against the Dalit congregation. They were charged for rioting, violent attacks on Dalits, and causing communal disharmony.

The probe agency said KKM’s Sudhir Dhawale, who was arrested on June 6, 2018 and is currently at the Taloja Central Jail, had performed in different parts of Maharashtra, made malicious speeches, spread false history, made disputable statements and incited objectionable slogans.

KKM was formed sometime in 2002 and indulged in street plays, cultural activities, poetry reading, etc.. Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor (arrested on September 7 and currently in Taloja Central Jail) have been associated with KKM since 2003. According to the NIA, the CPI (Maoist) systematically entered in KKM in such a way that the operation went unnoticed in 2005.

The chargesheet states, “It is revealed that the policy of the banned organisation CPI (Maoist) is that by misleading the Dalit faction to propagate the hardcore Maoist philosophy amongst the Dalits – these acts are ultra vires to the Constitution of India; it is also intend to take the Dalits on the path of violence, as such as a part of pursuing this policy, Dhawale of KKM and its other activists were making objectionable statements about history which were detrimental to the social harmony and they were playing street-plays, singing objectionable songs. As a result of which, in the vicinity area of Koregaon-Bhima grave situation of stone pelting, violence, arson and death of an innocent person took place.”

The agency adds, “Using the platform of Elgar Parishad Programme, Dhawale and other of KKM namely, Mr Gorkhe, Mr Gaichor, Jyoti Jagtap (arrested on September 8 currently at Byculla jail) have established underground contact with the banned organisation CPI (Maoist) through its activists working at Delhi namely Rona Wilson (arrested on June 8, 2018 currently at Taloja Central Jail) and (Prof) Hany Babu (arrested on July 28 currently at Taloja Central Jail).”

It is NIA’s contention that, “The play performed by KKM trio, ‘Peshwai ki Lokshah’ they said ill about the government established by law and promoting enmity between different groups and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony, peace and tranquility.”

“The trio are members of CPI (Maoist) in urban areas on the directions of wanted accused Milind Teltumbde (chargesheeted). In order to take directions for furthering activities of CPI (Maoist) in urban area in 2011, they stayed in Korchi for two-three months and underwent training related to usage of weapons, explosives and physical activities etc,” the chargesheet mentions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t1ckb6/article26972469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-NIA-SUDERSHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kabir-kala-manchs-plays-songs-led-to-violence-death-at-bhima-koregaon-nia/article32919883.ece
56,2020/10/15,Supreme Court asks government to respond to plea to use ‘plain English’,"Everything is so complicated and confusing, submits petitioner

The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the government to respond to a plea to use “plain English” for drafting laws, Government Orders and notifications to make them digestible for the public.

Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde referred to writer Anthony Burgess’s work Language Made Plain, and said the more simple the language, the more people were attracted to it.

The Bench, led by the Chief Justice of India, issued notice to the government on a petition filed by Dr. Subhash Vijayran, who also wants a new course of study in law colleges called ‘Legal Writing in Plain English’. Stodgy sounding legalese and officialese merely confuse, the petition maintains.

The petition said the government should release guides which would help ordinary people make an intelligent study of laws. These handbooks should be written in simple language. Dr. Vijayran said legal drafting is often couched in “dull” if not “pompous” terms.

“Everything is so complicated and confusing,” he submitted.

The petitioner also said the oral arguments of lawyers in court should not be rambling, but made to the point so that the court gets time for all and not an elite few.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x1c35/article32837640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-LTSUPREMECOURTOFINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-asks-govt-to-respond-to-plea-to-use-plain-english/article32863761.ece
57,2020/10/15,States must fight Central farm laws in Supreme Court: Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh,"Umbrella farmer body’s letter to CMs urges States to enact their own laws to protect MSP

A day after its leaders participated in a walkout and demonstration at Krishi Bhavan, the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh (RKM) is taking the fight to State capitals.

The umbrella body for more than 180 farmers groups across the country has written to the Chief Ministers of all States, demanding that they fight the controversial farm market reform laws in the Supreme Court on the grounds that the Centre has usurped States’ rights to make laws on agricultural issues. They also want all States to bring out their own legislation providing a legal guarantee to Minimum Support Price (MSP).

“State governments are limiting themselves to making statements only. They are not taking concrete steps against these laws,” said RKM spokesperson Abhimanyu Kohar. “They need to step up and take responsibility. If they do not take concrete legal steps soon, then we will oppose them also, just as we have been opposing the Central government.”

The letter lays out the legal argument for questioning the Constitutional validity of the three laws passed by Parliament last month. “Agriculture being a State subject under the Constitution, any Central legislation seeking to remove barriers to trade and creating a unified national market for farm produce has the capacity to start a fresh debate on federalism. Union of India lacks legislative power to bring such an enactment and in the garb of reforms, have pushed forth an ill-thought-out piece of legislation,” says the letter.

Accusing the Centre of “trespassing” on a State subject, the letter argues that the new legislation could prevent State governments from bringing out marketing schemes to aid their own farmers, and urged States to approach the apex court.

The RKM also urged States to fix MSP themselves and enact new laws which ban sale, purchase or contract of farm produce below MSP rates, including by corporates and private buyers.

Among others, the letter is signed by RKM national convenor Shiv Kumar Sharma, better known as “Kakkaji”, who has previously been associated with the Sangh Parivar, but who led the 2017 farm protests in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh when police shot dead six farmers, sparking off a nationwide agitation. Another signatory is Bharatiya Kisan Union-Ekta’s Jagjeet Singh Dallewal, who is a key player in the ongoing protests and rail blockade in Punjab, and was a member of the delegation who walked out on the meeting with Union Agriculture Secretary on Wednesday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uuzrh6/article32846696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PUNJABFARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/states-must-fight-central-farm-laws-in-sc-rashtriya-kisan-mahasangh/article32863465.ece

The statement came amid reports in a section of the media that the CBI had completed the probe and was about to submit its findings in the court.

Earlier, following some media reports that a team of medical experts from the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences had concluded that it was a case of suicide, the CBI had clarified that it was probing all aspects.

The CBI had taken over the case on August 6, following a reference from the Bihar police through the Department of Personnel and Training. It has examined Sushant’s flat where his body was found on June 14, questioned the suspects and also recorded the statements of several witnesses and his family members.

Based on a complaint from Sushant’s father, alleging abetment of suicide, criminal conspiracy, cheating, breach of trust, theft, wrongful restraint and confinement, the Patna police had in the last week of July registered a case against Rhea Chakraborty, her three family members and two others.

59,2020/10/15,India’s first Oscar winner Bhanu Athaiya dies in Mumbai home,"Ms. Athaiya, who won an Oscar for her work in the 1983 epic film Gandhi , passed away peacefully in her sleep, her daughter Radhika Gupta said.

Costume designer Bhanu Athaiya, India’s first Oscar winner, died at her home on Thursday after prolonged illness, her daughter said. She was 91.

Ms. Athaiya, who won an Oscar for her work in the 1983 epic film Gandhi , passed away peacefully in her sleep, her daughter Radhika Gupta said.

The last rites took place at the Chandanwadi crematorium in south Mumbai “She passed away early this morning. Eight years ago, she was diagnosed with a tumour in her brain. For the last three years, she was bedridden because one side (of her body) was paralysed, her daughter said.

The Kolhapur-born Athaiya, who worked till just five years ago, began her career as a costume designer in Hindi cinema with Guru Dutt’s 1956 superhit “C.I.D.”. She went on to work in over 100 films.

She won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design in Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi , with Ben Kingsley as the Mahatma, along with John Mollo. The lavish biopic of Mahatma Gandhi swept the Oscars with eight awards.

""It’s too good to believe. Thank you Academy and thank you Sir Richard Attenborough for focusing world attention on India,"" Ms. Athiaya had said in her acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.

In 2012, Ms. Athaiya returned her Oscar to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for safe keeping.

In an interview to PTI, the veteran designer had said she doesn’t have regrets about giving the award back.

“I have wanted this for some time. I want to thank the Academy for helping me. Many Oscar winners in the past have returned their Oscars for safe keeping. It is a tradition with the Academy,” she had said.

Ms. Athaiya was apparently worried for the safety of the trophy. She had previously donated “a huge collection of papers relating to “Gandhi” to the Academy.

Recalling the moment her name was announced, Ms. Athaiya had said fellow nominees told her she was a frontrunner for the best costume award.

“I was sitting in the audience with the other nominees in my category. They all told me that they did not stand a chance to win the Oscar. They told me my canvas was huge so I would definitely win the award. In my mind, I had told myself that I had done my best, that I had done justice to Gandhiji’s name and the freedom movement.

“When they called my name, I did not allow myself to get carried away. I calmly went on the stage and thanked Sir Richard and the Academy. When I went backstage, I was surprised as there were so many photographers taking pictures. But it was a great feeling. I was happy,” she recounted.

The veteran who defined the aesthetics of Hindi cinema through her prolific work, created some of Bollywood’s best remembered looks, including Vyjayantihmala in “Aamrapaali”, Waheeda Rehman in “Guide” and Zeenat Aman in “Satyam Shivam Sundaram.”

One of the most respected names in the film industry, Ms. Athaiya also worked with noted filmmakers like Yash Chopra. And in a career of more than five decades won two National Awards — for Gulzar’s mystery drama “Lekin” (1990) and the period film “Lagaan” directed by Ashutosh Gowariker (2001).

Things did not change much after the Oscar win, she had said in 2010. The costume department continued to be a neglected part of the Indian film industry.

“Costumes have a huge role in making a film look real and believable, but Indian filmmakers have never given due importance to it and nowadays the trend is to just go shopping abroad and put things together. In my opinion that is not the correct thing to do,” she had said at the launch of her book “The Art of Costume Design” published by Harper Collins at the time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/balvj7/article32863319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHANUATHAIYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-first-oscar-winner-bhanu-athaiya-dies-in-mumbai-home/article32863320.ece

Appearing before a Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that “public order and police are not within the domain of the Legislative Assembly. So it [Delhi Assembly] is without jurisdiction”.

Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, for the Assembly, explained that Mr. Mohan was called as an expert to put forth “constructive suggestions” in order to prevent such incidents from happening due to the indiscriminate use of social media platforms. He said the role of the Assembly’s Committee on Peace and Harmony, before which Mr. Mohan was asked to appear, was to make “positive recommendations”. There was no coercive action intended against him.

But senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Mr. Mohan and Facebook, maintained that his client cannot be “compelled” to appear against his “right of silence” in an issue on which he did not want to comment. He said the threat of breach of privilege action was “worse than clutching at straws”. The case required detailed hearing on the jurisdiction of the committee to summon his client.

63,2020/10/15,No messages sent to Pakistan for dialogue: MEA,"Ministry rubbishes senior Pakistani official’s claim

The Government of India on Thursday categorically denied that it has reached out for dialogue with Pakistan, dismissing a suggestion by a senior Pakistani official that the Modi government had sent “messages” for a conversation to the Imran Khan government in the past year.

Also read: Editorial | Bad to worse: On India-Pakistan ties

“The statements made by [Mr. Yusuf] are contrary to facts on the ground, misleading and fictitious. As regards the purported message, let me make it clear that no such message was sent from our side,” said Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Anurag Srivastava at a weekly press briefing.

The claim by Mr. Khan’s Special Assistant on National Security and Strategic Policy Planning, Moeed Yusuf, in an interview to web-based portal The Wire earlier this week had led to some speculation and some skepticism about whether the governments would explore reopening the bilateral dialogue process that has been shut down for the past five years.

In his interview to The Wire’s anchor Karan Thapar, Mr. Yusuf said Pakistan would begin any dialogue if it was sure that there was an “intent” for results, not for “show or effect”, and claimed that India wanted a dialogue in order to reassure international concerns over India-Pakistan tensions.

“In the past year we’ve got messages about a desire for conversation but you know why there is a desire for conversation – in my reading? So that there can be a dialogue which India can take to the world and say, ‘Oh, everything settled, Pakistan-India have agreed,’” said Mr. Yusuf. However, he declined to give any details or content of the “messages” allegedly received from India, and added that Pakistan would not agree to dialogue without specific actions on Jammu and Kashmir.

‘Interference in India’s internal affairs’

The MEA dismissed the statements as interference in India’s internal affairs.

“As always, this is Pakistan’s effort to divert attention from domestic failures of the present government and mislead its domestic constituents by pulling India into headlines on a daily basis. The official is well advised to restrict his advice to his establishment and not to comment on India’s domestic policy,” Mr. Srivastava said in his response to Mr. Yusuf's interview.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q7xzei/article32862677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANURAGSRIVASTAVA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-messages-sent-to-pakistan-for-dialogue-mea/article32862678.ece
64,2020/10/15,"Will write to EPCA, CPCB for shutting 11 coal-fired power plants near Delhi: Minister Gopal Rai","Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Thursday said he will ask the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and a Supreme Court-mandated pollution control authority to shut the 11 coal-fired power plants operating within 300 kilometres of Delhi within a week.

Mr. Rai said the Delhi government has been making all efforts to bring pollution levels down, “but we become helpless when pollution from neighbouring states affects the city’s air quality”.

A layer of haze hung over Delhi and its neighbouring areas on Thursday and the air quality slipped to “very poor” levels. Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 315 at 11:10 a.m. The last time the air quality hit such a poor level was in February.

Mr. Rai said, “I am going to write a letter to the CPCB and the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, asking them to shut these power plants within seven days till the situation improves.”

The minister said authorities are considering granting extension to these power plants to meet the new emission norms, instead of shutting them.

The 11 power plants have missed two deadlines to install flue-gas desulphurisation units to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions.

The CPCB had earlier set the deadline as December 2017 to meet the emission standards. It was later extended by two years to December 31, 2019.

“The CPCB recently said these power plant can operate if they pay a fine of ₹ 18 lakh a month. How can they allow them to run? How can you play with people’s lives?” Mr. Rai asked.

India is the largest emitter of SO2 in the world. Thermal power plants account for 45% of total industrial SO2 emissions in the country. Flue-gas desulfurisation (FGD) units can reduce SO2 emissions by 80%.

The minister said the Delhi government banned electricity generators with the Graded Response Plan coming into force on Thursday, “but Haryana wants relaxations, why?”

“They were exempted last year too. If diesel generators are operated in Gurugram and Faridabad, won’t it affect Delhi’s air quality? “

The Haryana administration recently told EPCA that around 16,200 people in some residential complexes and condominiums in Gurugram and Faridabad will be affected by the ban, as their developers or builders have not yet taken electricity connections.

Rai questioned why the Centre and states are not taking any action against brick kilns operating in nearby areas using outdated technologies.

There are more than 1,640 such brick kilns in Uttar Pradesh, 161 in Haryana and 164 Rajasthan.

He also said Delhi will be able to reduce vehicular pollution by 15-20% if people turn off their vehicles at red lights.

65,2020/10/15,IAF team in France to make preparations to induct more Rafale jets,"The second batch of four Rafale jets is expected to arrive in India in the next four weeks.

As it prepares to induct a second batch of Rafale jets, the Indian Air Force has sent a team of officials to France to oversee the logistical issues and review the training of a hand-picked group of pilots at the Saint-Dizier air base there, officials said on Thursday.

The second batch of four Rafale jets is expected to arrive in India in the next four weeks.

The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of these aircraft at a cost of ₹ 59,000 crore.

Several teams from the IAF have visited France since January to oversee the progress of the Rafale project including integration of India-specific enhancements and weapons systems, the officials said.

The IAF’s Rafale project management team has an office in Paris headed by a Group Captain-rank officer. The team is tasked with overseeing the production timelines as well as coordinating training of the crew.

A team of experts headed by assistant chief of air staff (projects) reached France earlier this week to coordinate logistical issues as well as training of pilots and technicians, said the officials.

The first batch of Rafale jets was finally inducted into the IAF on September 10.

Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on October 5 said the induction of all 36 Rafale jets will be completed by 2023.

Ten Rafale jets have been delivered to India so far and five of them stayed back in France for imparting training to IAF pilots.

Known for their air-superiority and precision strikes, the Rafale jets are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 year after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.

The newly inducted fleet has been carrying out sorties in eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese troops are engaged in a bitter border row for over five months.

69,2020/10/15,Hathras gang rape case | Supreme Court may ask Allahabad High Court to oversee CBI probe,"Petitioners and intervenors wanted the apex court to directly monitor probe.

The Supreme Court on Thursday indicated its inclination to ask the Allahabad High Court to supervise the CBI investigation into the brutal assault, alleged rape and subsequent death of a 19-year-old Dalit girl by four upper caste men at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde orally told the petitioners and intervenors who wanted the apex court to directly monitor the probe that “we are sending all of you to Allahabad High Court”. The Bench then reserved the case for orders.

“We are here as appellate, ultimate supervisory body, but let the Allahabad HC do it... We are always here”, Chief Justice Bobde orally remarked during the hearing.

The State government and the Director General of Police (DGP) left it to the wisdom of the court to decide which court should supervise the probe, saying their only purpose is to see justice in the case.

Probe on: SG

“Do not be concerned... State government has raised no objections. There should not be any shadow of doubt. The CBI took over the case on October 10 and the investigation is on”, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the government, submitted.

Mr. Mehta only objected to a plea that the charge sheet in the case should be filed in Delhi. He said the final report ought to be filed in the jurisdictional court as per the law.

The DGP, to a plea that CRPF personnel and not the State police should form the security net around the victim’s family and witnesses, left it to the court to decide “whoever best protects the family”.

Senior advocate Harish Salve, for the DGP, submitted, “We have not objected to anything”.

Chief Justice Bobde responded, “We are not saying the State is partisan...”.

Govt affidavit

The government had filed an affidavit, saying it was “committed” to providing “complete security” to the family and witnesses. It detailed the security for the family members. There would be “no intrusion in the privacy of the victim's family/witnesses and that they are free to move and meet the people they want”, it said.

The affidavit came in response to a petition filed by Satyama Dubey, represented by advocates Sanjeev Malhotra and Pradeep Kumar Yadav, seeking a fair probe into the crime.

70,2020/10/15,Nitin Gadkari launches blasting process for Zojila tunnel construction work,"Initiating the blast in a virtual ceremony, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Gadkari termed it a “moment of pride” for India

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday launched the first blasting for construction related work at the 14.15 km Zojila tunnel, one of the longest in Asia, that will provide all-year connectivity between Srinagar valley and Leh.

The project holds strategic significance as Zojila Pass is situated at an altitude of 11,578 feet on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh National Highway and remains closed during winters due to heavy snowfall. At present it is one of the most dangerous stretches in the world to drive a vehicle and this project is also geo-strategically sensitive.

Initiating the blast in a virtual ceremony, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Gadkari termed it a “moment of pride” for India.

He said the re-modelling of the project will result in savings to the tune of ₹4,000 crore to the public exchequer without any compromise on safety, security and quality.

Blasting means blowing up or breaking apart something solid with explosives.

The tunnel will provide all-weather connectivity between Srinagar valley and Leh (Ladakh plateau) on NH-1, and will bring about an all-round economic and socio-cultural integration of Jammu & Kashmir.

It involves construction of a 14.15-km long tunnel at an altitude of about 3,000 m under Zojila pass (presently motorable only for six months in a year) on NH-1 connecting Srinagar and Leh through Drass and Kargil.

“This tunnel when completed will be a landmark achievement in the history of modern India. It will also be of great importance to the Defence of the country, in view of the fact that massive military activities along our borders in Ladakh, Gilgit and Baltistan regions are taking place,” the government said.

Zojila Tunnel project shall bring to fruition, 30 years of overwhelming public demand of Kargil, Drass and Ladakh region, the statement said and added that the project will make the travel on Srinagar-Kargil-Leh Section of NH-1 free from avalanches, would enhance safety and would reduce the travel time from more than 3 hours to 15 minutes.

The project was re-awarded this year to Megha Engineering & Infrastructure Ltd (MEIL) which had emerged as the lowest bidder quoting ₹4,509.5 crore for the project. The other two bidders in the race were Larsen & Toubro and Ircon International JV.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2018, had laid the foundation stone for the ₹ 6,800 crore project, billed as Asia’s longest bi-directional tunnel, in Jammu and Kashmir.

Unveiling a plaque for commencement of work for the tunnel, Modi had said, “Zojila tunnel is not a mere tunnel but a modern-day marvel.”

However, the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL) on January 15, 2019 terminated the contract awarded to troubled IL&FS group company — IL&FS Transportation -- after it abandoned the project citing financial problems.

In February this year, Mr. Gadkari reviewed the whole project in detail in order to reduce the cost and to execute the languishing project on priority and had referred the matter to an expert group that suggested construction of two-lane bi-directional single tube tunnel without parallel egress/escape passage and reduction in construction shafts from three to two.

“The construction cost of Zojila tunnel was earlier worked out at ₹ 6,575.85 crore and after considering the escalation @ 5 per cent per annum and the total capital cost of the project as ₹8,308 crore by NHIDCL. Thus, the total integrated cost of the project including Zojila tunnel and approaches up to Z- Morh tunnel works out to ₹10,643 crores,” Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said.

Compared to the present cost of the integrated project, based on the tender received at ₹4,509.5 crore, the total capital cost of the project would be ₹ 6,808.63 crore, it added.

“Thus, after re-modelling of the project and reaping the benefit of integrated project management by segregating the egress tunnel & utilizing the excavated rock material in construction of approaches, generated from tunnel boring, resulted in an anticipated saving of ₹3,835 crore,” it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/j61urw/article32084174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE14GADKARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nitin-gadkari-launches-blasting-process-for-zojila-tunnel-construction-work/article32860889.ece

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has arrested Niketa Baldevbhai Dave, a director of Pentium Infotech Limited and Hirak Biotech Limited, in connection with an alleged fraud of ₹25.25 crore in the Ahmedabad People’s Cooperative Bank Limited.

The agency has secured four days’ custody of the accused from a special court in Ahmedabad. The case is based on the investigation conducted by the CID-Crime of Gandhinagar Zone. It was alleged that Ms. Dave, another director Pratik R. Shah, and others were involved in the fraud.

According to the ED, the accused persons opened overdraft accounts against fixed deposits in the cooperative bank. The companies defaulted on repayments, causing a loss of ₹25.25 crore to the bank. Mr. Shah had also opened 20 IBL accounts with the bank, having ₹50.00 lakh sanctioned to each account, in the name of his office staff, firms and associates.

Ms. Dave, as a director/proprietor/partner, then applied for loan for seven of the 20 firms. They were identified as S J Securities Limited, Pioneer Mercantile Limited, Vitale Bio Science Limited, Satark Real Estate Limited, Jupiter Business Limited, Lakshya Securities & Credit Holding Limited and Arihant Jewellers.

The two accused, as directors of Hirak Biotech Limited, passed a board resolution on February 25, authorising Ms. Dave to enter into any transaction related to the non-agricultural land in Sachana held in the company’s name. Based on the resolution, she allegedly executed sale deeds in March to transfer the properties without receiving any consideration, it is alleged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6nhzp6/article32641827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-ED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-arrests-accused-in-2525-crore-cooperative-bank-fraud-case/article32860590.ece

Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday flagged off 50 CPCB inspection teams for field visits in Delhi-NCR to keep a watch on pollution hot spots during the winter season and urged the Punjab government to curb stubble burning.

However, he said stubble burning is not a major factor for air pollution in Delhi-NCR.

“Only 4% pollution is due to stubble burning. Ninety-six per cent of it is due to local factors like biomass burning, garbage dumping, unpaved roads, dust, construction and demolition activities etc,” he said, speaking to reporters at his residence in Delhi.

From lewd comments to demands for sex, women working in India's vast informal sector rarely report sexual harassment for fear of losing their jobs, labour rights campaigners said on Wednesday, three years after the #MeToo movement began.

From street vendors and factory workers to domestic workers, 95% of Indian women work in the informal sector and many are exploited regularly, despite a law ordering employers to set up committees to resolve harassment complaints, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said.

Data | 92% Indian women take part in unpaid domestic work; only 27% men do so

The Ministry of Women and Child Development did not respond to repeated requests for comment. It launched an online complaint box for sexual harassment at work in 2017, which received about 600 complaints in its first two years.

Shalini, a domestic worker who was sexually harassed by a security guard for months while working at a private residence on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi, said ordinary women were too scared to speak out.

“Some families blame the woman and start beating her. If you tell your employer, then they will fire you ... Police are the worst. They ask really inappropriate questions,” said Shalini, whose name has been changed to protect her identity.

“With no one to turn to, most women just bottle it all up inside. They learn to ignore or normalise it,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that in her case, the guard was transferred after her family complained to his employer.

The #MeToo campaign led to complaints of sexual misconduct by prominent journalists, film stars and executives across India but had little effect in remote, rural areas where sex crimes are rife, according to women's rights activists.

“The #MeToo movement helped to shine a light on violence and harassment at work, but the experiences of millions of women in India's informal sector remain invisible,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, HRW South Asia director. “India has progressive laws to protect women from sexual abuse by bosses, colleagues, and clients, but has failed to take basic steps to enforce these laws”.

‘The law has failed’

Reporting of sex crimes increased in India after the fatal gang rape of a student on a bus in 2012, with the introduction of tougher penalties, including a 2013 law to combat sexual harassment at work.

Although the groundbreaking law mandates employers with at least 10 workers to set up women-led complaint committees with the power to fine or fire those found guilty of harassment, it remains largely an idea on paper, local researchers found.

Only about 30% of 655 districts surveyed said they had formed committees, found a 2018 study by the Martha Farrell Foundation, a women's rights group, and PRIA India, a research centre.

“The implementation of the law has failed in the informal sector,” said Anagha Sarpotdar, chairwoman of a complaints committee in Mumbai, India's most populous city, adding that lack of awareness about the system led to few reports.

Shalini Sinha, country representative for WIEGO, a network which helps informal workers, said it was important to form and bolster associations, self-help groups and trade unions to empower women.

“These can strengthen women so that this sense of isolation that they feel while trying to report sexual harassment is not there,” she said, adding they can also raise women's awareness on their rights.

But Shalini said she still would not report sexual harassment, even though she knew her rights, as “people like me do not get justice”.

Instead, she jots down her employers' phone numbers, addresses and her work hours in each home so that her family knows where she is at all times.

“Some employers are good, some are bad. But because of previous experiences, there is always a fear inside me,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fzv4nj/article24007899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rape,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-women-in-informal-sector-learn-to-ignore-sexual-abuse-at-work/article32859977.ece
75,2020/10/15,PM Modi pays tribute to former President Abdul Kalam,"India can never forget his indelible contribution towards national development, Mr. Modi tweeted on the ‘People’s President'’s 89th birth anniversary

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid tributes to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, saying India can never forget his indelible contribution towards national development, be it as a scientist or the country’s president.

Kalam served as the 11th President of India between 2002-07 and earned the respect and admiration of people and political parties across the spectrum for his simple living and non-partisan conduct.

He is also credited with opening the doors of the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the masses and came to be affectionately called the ‘People’s President’.

He continued with his quest to guide and inspire the new generation with his speaking tours across the country after his term was over.

On his 89th birth anniversary, Modi tweeted, “Tributes to Dr. Kalam on his Jayanti. India can never forget his indelible contribution towards national development, be it as a scientist and as the President of India. His life journey gives strength to millions.”

The Prime Minister also tagged a short clip of his laudatory references to Kalam in past.

Kalam, who died in 2015, also earned the sobriquet ‘Missile Man of India’ for his role in the development of India’s missile programmes.

Kalam an inspiration to every Indian: Venkaiah Naidu

Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday remembered former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on his birth anniversary, recalling his words that dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action.

“He made invaluable contribution in strengthening India’s defence & space capabilities.

The Gwalior Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court has directed the Datia and Gwalior District Magistrates to register FIRs against members of congregations violating COVID-19 norms and against those at whose behest they were organised.

A Division Bench of Justices Sheel Nagu and Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava, while hearing a petition filed by lawyer Ashish Pratap Singh, on October 12 ordered Superintendents of Police of both the districts to file compliance reports in this regard before the next date of hearing.

In addition, the court directed the Central and State governments and the Election Commission of India to respond before the next date of hearing to the petitioner’s prayer of staying the relaxation made in relation to the permissible size of congregations.

Meanwhile, the petitioner placed a report before the court highlighting that despite its previous order restraining large congregations, meetings reportedly having between 300 and 500 participants were held on October 3-6 on behalf of political leaders, including Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and former Chief Minister Kamal Nath. Besides, three amicus curiae filed a joint report pointing to breach of COVID-19 norms at gatherings accompanied by photographs of meetings held primarily by political parties in view of the pending byelection.

The court observed the congregations revealed the commission of cognisable offence under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and although the information was submitted before the police, no consequential action of registering FIRs under Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. had been taken yet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/register-firs-against-participants-organisers-of-large-meetings-mp-hc/article32858006.ece
77,2020/10/15,Special Punjab Assembly session to bring legislation to counter Centre’s farm laws,"Cabinet meeting chaired by Amarinder also opts for 33% reservation for women in direct recruitment in Punjab Civil Services

The Punjab government has decided to convene a special session of the Assembly on October 19 to bring in legislation to counter the Centre’s agriculture sector laws. The decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, according to an official statement.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had earlier announced that his government would fight the new agriculture sector laws through legislative, legal and other routes.

The government also opted for 33% reservation for women in direct recruitment in Punjab Civil Services. The Cabinet meeting, which was chaired by the Chief Minister, approved the Punjab Civil Services (Reservation of Posts for Women) Rules, 2020, to provide such reservation for women for direct recruitment to posts in government, as well as recruitment to boards and corporations in Group A, B, C and D posts.

The Cabinet also approved a State Employment Plan 2020-22, to fill vacant jobs in government departments, boards, corporations and agencies in a phased manner. The recruitment will be done on Central government pay scales, in line with the earlier Cabinet decision to this effect, said the statement.

The Cabinet also gave approval to notify the Rules of the Punjab Slum Dwellers (Proprietary Rights) Act 2020 for the purpose of giving proprietary rights of land to slum dwellers, thus ensuring basic amenities for them, it added.

It was also decided to allow production of quality seed potato through tissue culture-based technology, using aeroponics-net house facilities, along with the certification of seed potato and its successive generations. The Cabinet approved the Punjab Tissue Culture Based Seed Potato Bill, 2020, to meet the demand of potato farmers for quality seed potato, and enable the development of the State as export hub for seed potato in the country, said the statement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6wf3tn/article32858003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THPUNJABCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/special-punjab-assembly-session-to-bring-legislation-to-counter-centres-farm-laws/article32858004.ece
78,2020/10/15,Punjab CM accuses BJP of trying to disturb law and order,"Amarinder says BJP State leadership trying to exploit October 12 incident to earn political brownie points

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday accused the BJP of resorting to provocative and inflammatory actions aimed at disturbing the State’s law and order in the wake of the recent attack on State BJP president Ashwani Sharma’s motorcade, for which the police have already identified several farmers union members as being responsible.

Terming Mr. Sharma’s accusations against the Punjab Congress baseless, the Chief Minister said the BJP leader seemed bent on spreading false propaganda to promote the interests of his party. “These actions were clearly aimed at diverting the attention of the people from the farmers’ angst against the BJP over the farm laws,” he said.

The Chief Minister asserted that the people of Punjab, including the farmers, would not be misled by the BJP’s irresponsible statements and actions.

“The farmers were angry and anguished at the farm laws enacted by the BJP-led Central government, and instead of empathising with them and conveying their pain to the high command, the BJP State leadership was trying to exploit the October 12 incident to earn political brownie points. Contrary to the falsehoods Mr. Sharma was trying to spread, the State government had been taking all steps to ensure the security of the BJP leaders amid the farmers’ protests,” he said.

Meanwhile, giving details of the incident of October 12, Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta said that around 7 p.m, Mr. Sharma’s motorcade was confronted by around 25 protesters belonging to different farmer’s unions.

“These protesters had been picketing the toll plaza at Cholang on NH-1 for almost two weeks from Jalandhar to Jammu. After 15-18 seconds of protest, both the vehicles in the motorcade, which kept moving all the time, were allowed to go but one of the protesters hit and broke the rear windscreen of one of the vehicles with a wooden flag stick,” he said.

A criminal case had been registered against the protesters under Sections 341, 427, 148, 149, 120 B of the Indian Penal Code, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/punjab-cm-accuses-bjp-of-trying-to-disturb-law-and-order/article32858000.ece
79,2020/10/15,Dissident Tripura BJP MLAs get no response from Delhi leadership,"There is a possibility of Cabinet expansion after Durga Puja to tackle dissidence before local civic polls

Dissident Tripura BJP MLAs, camping in New Delhi for over a week, have reportedly received no response from the party’s top brass on their demand to make changes in the State organisation and Council of Ministers. They have been told to return to the State and work united for the coming civic elections and tribal autonomous district council.

Former Health Minister Sudip Roy Barman and Ramprasad Paul have allegedly raised the rebellion against Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb and took the fight to Delhi. Most of the dissident MLAs are Congress turncoats and apparently find it tough to adjust with the code of behaviour of the saffron party.

After meeting two general secretaries and finally the party’s national president, J.P. Nadda, on Tuesday evening, the dissident leaders made a departure from their stance. Mr. Barman now said he had no differences with Mr. Biplab Kumar Deb.

“The Chief Minister is doing well for the people and development of the State,” Mr. Barman told a news agency. He termed reports on differences within the Tripura BJP ‘cooked-up stories’.

Other dissident leader Mr. Ramprasad Paul distanced himself from the whole controversy. He claimed that he had to attend a programme of an NGO and was of the view that other leaders might have similar personal reasons to be in New Delhi.

Mr. Paul, however, said they could always discuss organisation matters with senior leaders for the betterment of the party.

State BJP president Manik Saha earlier said any attempt to lobby to press demands would amount to breach of discipline. Sources in the BJP on Wednesday said there was a possibility of expanding the Council of Ministers after the Durga Puja to tackle dissidence before local elections.

80,2020/10/15,Nadda to visit West Bengal ahead of Durga Puja,"Earlier, Union Home Minister Amit Shah was scheduled to visit the State

Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP) president J.P. Nadda will visit West Bengal next week ahead of the Durga Puja festivities. Earlier, Union Home Minister Amit Shah was scheduled to visit the State later this month but now Mr. Nadda will visit.

According to BJP leaders, Mr. Nadda will be in Siliguri in north Bengal on October 19. The BJP leadership including Mr. Nadda and Mr. Shah have been holding virtual meetings and rallies in the State for the past few months. This will be the first visit of Mr. Nadda after the outbreak of the pandemic. After the BJP’s impressive performance in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, Mr. Shah addressed party supporters at the Netaji Indoor Stadium.

The State BJP leadership sent two letters to the Union Home Ministry. Its MP Locket Chatterjee wrote to Mr. Shah demanding that the blast at a local club in Kolkata’s Beleghata area should be probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The roof of the club was blown off on Tuesday in the explosion which was most likely due to piling up of crude bombs.

Another BJP MP Santanu Thakur also wrote to the Centre on the implementation of The Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Mr. Thakur, MP from Bongaon in the North 24 Parganas, is a leader from the Matua community. Getting citizenship has been a longstanding demand of the Matuas belonging to Namashudra community who migrated from East Pakistan and Bangladesh.

“Wherever I go, people ask me about when the Act will be implemented,” Mr. Thakur said.

83,2020/10/15,Centre concedes State’s request to surrender 125 MW thermal power,"‘It will help save ₹150 crore per annum on fixed costs’

The Union Ministry of Power (MoP) has conceded the Andhra Pradesh government’s request to surrender 125 MW of thermal power allocated to the distribution companies (Discoms) by the NTPC for bundling with the solar energy under the National Solar Mission (NSM).

With this, the Discoms will be saving ₹150 crore per annum on fixed costs, according to an official release.

The power was allocated to the Discoms on July 5, 2017, from the coal-based stations of the NTPC. On receiving a communication from the MoP, the Central Electricity Authority gave its consent.

The State’s Energy Department welcomed the decision, and said it would help in minimising the power procurement costs and reducing unwanted financial burden on the Discoms.

Priority area

Energy Secretary N. Srikant thanked the secretary of MoP, Sanjiv Nandan Sahai, for approving the government’s proposal.

He stated the government was exploring ways to reduce the power purchase costs and accorded high priority to cost-effective power.

The measures being taken for the last one year for reviving and strengthening the power utilities, mainly by procuring power at cheaper rate, were yielding the desired result, he said.

With spot purchase of power at an average price of ₹1.63 to ₹2.80 per unit during March and April of the current year, the power utilities reduced the financial burden on Discoms to a large extent. The government also saved around ₹180 crore in coal tenders, Mr. Srikant added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/centre-concedes-states-request-to-surrender-125-mw-thermal-power/article32865891.ece
84,2020/10/15,Children of trafficking victims worst hit by COVID situation,"They are suffering from multiple types of emotional disorders, finds survey

All sections of people are adversely affected by COVID-19 situation in one way or the other but the children of trafficking victims are among the worst-hit, finds a survey by an Ongole-based non-governmental organisation.

Their vulnerability to social and psychological problems has increased manifold during the pandemic, observes HELP director N.V.S. Rammohan while underscoring the need for providing not only mental health care but also community-based rehabilitation for their recovery and emotional well-being.

In the current situation, sex workers, many of them single parents, are deprived of their income and the stigma and criminalisation of their work make it hard for them to find an alternative job. With nil or minimal government support, they seek financial help from money-lenders. This makes their children more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation as some of the lenders act as middlemen for traffickers. Their mental health further deteriorates with the psychological stress triggered by COVID-19.

Revealing the survey findings on the mental health status of the children of trafficking victims in the State to The Hindu here, he says 407 children in 10-24 age group interviewed by HELP volunteers recently revealed that they suffered from multiple types of emotional disorders such as depression, anxiety, fear and avoidance. The survey covered 67 children of women in commercial sex work, including 25 girls in Prakasam district, 210 in Guntur district, including 75 girls, and 130 in Krishna, including 45 girls.

Findings

It has been found that 62% of them felt very bad in the present environment, 12% had entertained the thought of committing suicide at least once, 30% avoided or feared speaking with their mother and 39% with their father. While 70% of them felt humiliated, 45% stammered/trembled and another 41% felt demotivated.

There were 47.9% who said they were not comfortable with the environment that they lived in, 61.7% often felt stressful, 96.3% were abused by parents (physically or emotionally). Over 70% of them did not even get a few hours per week to play sports or pursue any other hobby, 61.7% did not feel safe at home or at school or in their neighbourhood and 86.7% didn’t know whom to access for help if in trouble.

The gravity of the problem could be understood in the State where about 3,250 prostitution localities existed with over 90,000 registered sex workers as found by the Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society, he says.

There is an urgent need to enact a comprehensive piece of legislation to deal with trafficking and ensure protection to children, he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/children-of-trafficking-victims-worst-hit-by-covid-situation/article32865855.ece
85,2020/10/15,Natural farming with an urban flavour,"Father-son duo growing vegetables in over six acres in a bustling locality of Tirupati

A father-son duo are making waves by growing organic vegetables in an area of six acres in a bustling locality of Tirupati city.

P. Prabhakar Naidu and his son Ajay Parthasarathy have been growing vegetables using the natural farming method with no chemicals at their family farm in Thimminaidupalem on the city outskirts. Mr. Ajay, who was working as a mechanical engineer for six years, quit his profession and turned to agriculture three years ago.

Mr. Prabhakar Naidu said that he used to cultivate sugarcane and paddy on his farm and had nearly called it quits after failing to find labour in the city. The father-son duo then switched to growing vegetables like lady’s finger, bitter gourd, brinjal, ridge gourd and bottle gourd on their farm.

Shunning traditional practices, Ajay developed bunds with a tractor, spread mulching sheets on them to keep weeds at bay, employed drip technology for optimal water usage and administered micro-nutrients like egg amino acid, fish amino acid and neem extract for balanced growth and pest control. Similarly, pheromone traps, sticky traps and fruitfly traps were brought in to eradicate aphids, sucking insects and moths.

Zero labour

The biggest cost advantage that the duo achieved was in the form of zero spending on labour.

“There is not even a single worker employed on the farm, as the entirely solar-fenced and mechanised farm is looked after only by my father and me, though in turns,” Mr. Ajay told The Hindu. The State government had bestowed the ‘Best Progressive Farmer’ award on Mr. Ajay for the year 2019.

Though the daily yield is close to 100 kg (three to four varieties included), the ‘organic’ tag has not helped them bag a sizeable market. “We are now tying up with apartments and social organisations like Rotary Club for bulk purchase of the naturally-grown produce. If the consumers look beyond the price tag and acknowledge the health benefits, even a 15% premium pricing will help meet the higher costs,” said Mr. Prabhakar Naidu.

Apart from vegetables, the duo grows betel leaves, lemongrass, Brahmi, teasel gourd, peppermint, basil seeds and Nela Vemu (a Siddha herb now used to build immunity against COVID-19 for their personal use. “We haven’t tried it on a commercial scale yet, as the demand is yet to be explored,” Mr. Ajay said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/59p1ii/article32865846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14-VJ-NATURALFARMING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/natural-farming-with-an-urban-flavour/article32865847.ece
86,2020/10/15,Sale of RTPP to NTPC put on hold,"Panel ‘cautions’ government against move to sell majority stake

The State government, for the time being, has dropped its plan to sell the 1,650 MW Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant (RTPP) to the NTPC, going by the recent communication sent by Energy Secretary N. Srikant to the A.P. State Power Employees’ Joint Action Committee.

Mr. Srikant, in his letter, said that the sale of RTPP had not been envisaged, which, a JAC leader said, was due to stiff resistance from the employees and some other reasons.

A four-member committee constituted by the government in January 2020 to look into the problems faced by the RTPP was learnt to have deliberated on the proposed acquisition of a majority stake in the RTPP by the NTPC, and had reportedly recommended to the government to not go ahead with it “with undue haste.”

Two options

The committee had initially suggested that the RTPP could be made viable by reducing costs through rationalisation of coal supply and staff pattern, or by bringing in a Joint Venture (JV) partner, subject to the jurisdiction of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission.

Reliable sources in the power sector said that the government had considered the sale of RTPP through the JV route on the grounds of high unit cost, large capital investments needed by it and coal problems, but chose to keep it on hold.

It may be noted that a delegation of the NTPC had held deliberations with top officials of the State Energy Department and even visited the plant to obtain a first-hand account of its operational and financial performance.

In fact, the AP-Genco had reviewed the functioning of all thermal plants in the context of the mandate given by the Central government to improve efficiencies and gradually phase out the obsolete ones.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sale-of-rtpp-to-ntpc-put-on-hold/article32865844.ece

The Vijayawada Postal Division of the Department of Posts felicitated its customers and staff members as part of National Postal Week, celebrated from October 9 to 15 at all the post offices in Krishna district.

In a statement released on Thursday, Senior Superintendent of Post Offices K. Sudheer Babu said oldest SB customers, older post box holders and customers who paid the highest premium, expressed their gratitude and recalled their good old memories associated with the Department of Posts.

Philately Day, celebrated as part of the celebrations, was attended by philatelists from Vijayawada, Guntur and Gudivada, who shared interesting stories on their collections, particularly those related to Mahatma Gandhi, which is relevant even today.

Campaigns such as Know Your Postman, Know your area PIN code and Know your Nearest Letterbox drew good response.

Mr. Babu said the department had opened new PPF accounts, Sukanya Samridhi Yojana accounts and had entered into Memorandums of Understanding with various organisations for bulk door delivery of articles.

The services of the Vijayawada Postal Division included delivery of laddu prasadam of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, Matha Vaishnodvi prasadam and from various other holy shrines in the country. “Ganga jal is the most popular and sought-after product delivered through Department of Posts.

88,2020/10/15,Young social entrepreneurs making a difference,"Four youngsters launch crowdfunding platform to help the underprivileged

When the lockdown was announced in March, people rushed home from wherever they were and religiously followed the “Stay Home, Stay Safe” directive to avoid the risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus.

“A conversation on the need for safety for all, with a cousin Vamsi Krishna, set us thinking about the plight of the marginalised families who do not have homes. Where would they go, we wondered,” recalls Lakshmi Janaki, a chartered accountant and co-founder of Givetoday, a crowdfunding platform that caters to the needs of the underprivileged sections through different online campaigns launched in collaboration with NGOs.

After five months of discussions and research on the best ways to reach out to the needy, with two other like-minded friends, Sai Vivek and Praveen, they decided to start a crowd-funding platform and Givetoday was born. Joined soon by three volunteers, the four youngsters started their first campaign on distribution of grocery kits to the marginalised families, in August.

Pooling in their own money, crowd-sourcing through internet, they collaborated with Dalit Bahujan Research Centre (DBRC) to identify the beneficiaries and distributed the kits comprising rice, pulses, wheat flour, oil and masala powders to around 70 families who eke out a living as rag-pickers at Poranki and a dump yard at Kandriga, a couple of days back.

“The help of grocery kits is very timely as many low income group families are starving after losing their livelihood due to COVID-19,” said A. Dev Kumar, Director, DBRC.

When asked why crowd funding, Ms. Janaki explains: “Raising small amounts of money from a large number of people and funding a project is easy. There are many people willing to do their bit, but how do you identify them? Internet is the right space where the whole world is today, especially in the wake of the pandemic,” she says, informing that they were happy to see people from overseas nations offering help.

Prior to that, Givetoday also donated tabs to five bright students from low income families who were unable to attend online classes.

Their next campaign is distribution of sanitary pads and inner wear to 75 orphan girls, through an NGO Providence Charitable Trust. “Personal hygiene is important,” she emphasised.

Within four weeks of its launch, the Givetoday team has raised over 600 products from over 100 donors that benefited over 300 families.

90,2020/10/15,"Engineering student attacked in her house, dies","The accused who sustained ‘self-inflicted’ injuries is being treated

Two days after a young woman was allegedly set ablaze by her “stalker” in the city, a 20-year-old engineering student was allegedly hacked to death in her house in Christurajapuram by a man for allegedly rejecting his love and marriage proposal.

The victim, V. Divya Tejaswini, was a student at an engineering college in Bhimavaram of West Godavari district. She was allegedly attacked with a knife by Nagendra Babu, a painter, when the former was sleeping alone at home around 11 a.m., according to the Machavaram police.

Nagendra also allegedly injured himself in the neck, abdomen and wrist with the same knife. While Divya died undergoing treatment at a private hospital, Nagendra is being treated at Guntur GGH.

According to locals, Divya and Nagendra reportedly knew each other since long, as the latter lived in the same street as Divya in the past. One of Divya’s cousin said that Nagendra spoke to him an hour before the incident and he had no clue that the accused would attack her.

Locals allege that Nagendra entered Divya's house from the back door after learning that her mother left the house to run an errand.

‘No witnesses’

Speaking to media, Commissioner of Police B. Sreenivasulu said: “We received information that Divya and Nagendra were found with injuries by her mother and neighbours. There were no witnesses to the incident. The victim’s mother was talking to a ward volunteer at a distance from the house when the incident happened. Upon returning home, she noticed that the doors were locked and both were lying in an unconscious state.”

As the man entered the girl’s house, the police were considering him as the culprit. They were yet to ascertain the motive behind the attack, Mr. Sreenivasulu said.

The police registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of IPC based on the complaint by the victim’s parents and examination of the victim’s wounds and the scene of the offence. The victim’s mother, Kusuma, told the media and police that Nagendra was harassing her daughter in the name of love.

Meanwhile, Nagendra’s brother came up with a photograph in which Nagendra and Divya are seen together. He claimed that the two got married secretly and were in a relationship for a long time.

101,2020/10/15,APSRTC to run Dasara specials only to Bengaluru,"No buses to Hyderabad thanks to the existing impasse

The hopes of a large number of people, who waited eagerly for inter-State bus services to resume between the State and Telangana by the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) at least during the Dasara festivities, are dashed to the ground.

The APSRTC will operate 1,850 special buses from October 15 to 28 to cater to the needs of the public during the festival days, but only within the State. Of the 1,850 buses, 574 buses would be operated to Bengaluru (562) and Ballari (12) ,while the remaining will be intra-State services.

“We are not operating any buses to Telangana, Chennai and Puducherry during this festival season,” said K.S. Brahmananda Reddy, the corporation's Executive Director (Operations).

This also means that people who plan to travel to a place outside the State during festival will be forced to rely on private operators, who charge exorbitant fares.

Standoff with TSRTC

About the standoff with its Telangana counterpart on the inter-State services issue, Mr. Reddy said the APSRTC had sent a proposal, agreeing to the Telangana demand that APSRTC buses operate in not more than 1.6 lakh km distance in that State. “We are waiting for their response,” he said.

The APSRTC has always been operating more number of buses to Telangana. Yielding to the neighbouring State’s demand in the past, Andhra Pradsh had reduced its operations from 3.73 lakh km per day in Telangana to 2.6 km, while latter increased its operations in Andhra Pradesh from 94,000 km to 1.52 km. There is still a gap of 1.1 lakh km of distance which has turned into a bone of contention.

APSRTC is ready to cut down on its operations in the neighbouring State by another 50% suggesting that TSRTC increase it by 50 % to reach a parity in distance.

‘Inconvenience to public’

“The routes we operate on are established routes, in high demand by the public. Every bus service on these routes has above 75% of occupancy ratio. Instead of putting the public to inconvenience by reducing our services, we are instead asking Telangana to scale up its operations in Andhra Pradesh. But they do not want to increase their bus operations and want us to further bring down the distance covered by us in Telangana to 1.61 km,” said Principal Secretary, Transport, and Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of APSRTC M. T. Krishna Babu.

The officials of the APSRTC are worried that giving up on profitable routes may further add to their revenue losses, besides causing travel inconvenience to the local public. “This will only benefit the private bus operators, who will capture RTC routes and fleece the public,” said Mr. Babu.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kltocq/article32857275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15VJPG4-APSRTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/apsrtc-to-run-dasara-specials-only-to-bengaluru/article32857276.ece

106,2020/10/15,No let-up in flood fury in Guntur as inflows into Prakasam Barrage swell,"First-level flood warning sounded in villages along the Krishna

The flood situation continued to remain grim in villages along the Krishna, with the district administration sounding a first-level flood warning on Wednesday.

Several low-lying areas in Amavarathi mandal upstream of Prakasam Barrage were marooned, and road links between Vijayawada and Amaravathi mandal remained cut off for the second day. Pedamadduru village and several other villages were marooned in Amaravathi while floodwaters inundated several areas.

Villages downstream of Pulichintala reservoir, Kethavaram, Bodhanam and Machavaram remained cut off from the mainland, and revenue and police officials began shifting families from low-lying areas. The district administration opened relief camps at areas in Sattenapalli where floodwaters entered several homes.

Meanwhile, the Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala reservoirs continued to receive massive inflows from Srisailam. The current reservoir level at Srisailam is 884 feet as against the Full Reservoir Level of 885 feet. The present water level in Nagarjuna Sagar is 589 feet as against the FRL of 590.55. The inflows at Nagarjuna Sagar were measured at 3.05 lakh cusecs while outflows are measured at 3.05 lakh cusecs.

The Pulichintala reservoir also continued to brim with floodwaters, and the present level touched 44.94 TMC as against the full capacity of 45.77 TMC. The inflows into the reservoir are at 4.30 lakh cusecs while the outflows at 5 lakh cusecs meant that the inflows into Prakasam Barrage have touched an alarming 7.40 lakh cusecs.

Reviewing the situation, Minister for Housing and District In-charge Minister Ch. Ranganatha Raju and Collector I. Samuel Ananda Kumar asked the departments of electricity, revenue, police and fire and emergency to be on high alert.

Karjol over handling the flood situation in the district, Congress leaders Sharan Prakash Patil, B.R. Patil, Allam Prabhu, and Jagadev Guttedar said that the in-charge Minister was insensitive to people’s sorrows and sufferings.

“Kalaburagi district is witnessing the worst rainy season and floods in the last 50 years. Large tracts of land with standing crops are submerged and thousands of houses have collapsed. With the submergence of several bridges, connectivity between villages and towns has remained cut off for days. Several tanks have breached flooding downstream fields and villages. With the loss of crops, farmers are staring at a difficult future. Rivers and streams are overflowing posing threats to villages along their courses.

The Congress leaders were addressing a media conference here on Thursday. Criticising the State government for its handling natural calamities, Mr. Sharan Prakash Patil said that he had no hopes that the BJP government in the State would help the flood-hit people in the district.

“The BJP has always been very insensitive to people’s problems. It never comes forward to help people when they are in trouble. It is very much evident in the way the BJP government has handled the flood situation in Belagavi and other parts in the Mumbai Karnataka region. It is again showing the same disinterest and insensitivity in the case of floods in Kalaburagi. As much as 75 % of crops were destroyed in the rain that lashed the district a few days ago. Now, the remaining 25 % of the crops are destroyed in the rain that is lashing the district now. Yet, neither Mr. Karjol visited the district nor any BJP MLA did anything to help the people in trouble,” Mr. Sharan Prakash Patil said.

The Congress leaders also appealed to Mr. Yediyurappa to conduct an aerial survey in the flood-hit regions along with the Union government’s team and take steps to pay compensation to the victims. “Kalaburagi district has only one NDRF team and it is not able to handle the flood situation on its own.

110,2020/10/15,BJP will win bypolls in State: Kateel,"The BJP general secretary C.T. Ravi and State president Nalin Kumar Kateel said the Congress will pay the price and suffer electoral defeat in the byelections in the State “for its role” in the Bengaluru violence.

He was in Mysuru to attend the party officer-bearers meeting on Thursday.

Mr. Ravi, who spoke to the media, said that the role and involvement the Congress and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) leaders in the violence has emerged and it was now clear who were behind the riots.

The WhatsApp chat details available with the investigating agencies was a direct pointer to the involvement of the Congress, Mr. Ravi added.

He said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who otherwise visits violence-affected places for political mileage, was silent, but the issue would be raised during the byelections. “The Congress has dug its own grave. Its role in the violence will prove to be electorally disastrous for the party,” said Mr. Ravi.

He asserted that the BJP would win the R.R. Nagar and Sira Assembly bypolls. He alleged that the Congress exploited the Dalits for political gains without doing anything for their welfare. On the ban on SDPI, Mr. Ravi said it has to be a legal process and the Home Department was at it.

Mr. Kateel said the Congress would face an electoral rout in the bypolls as it was emaciated. “It is a party that cannot seek justice for its MLA Akhanda Srinivas Murthy, whose house was torched during the Bengaluru riots by its own party member. The Congress president cannot demand the arrest of the culprits responsible for the incident.

111,2020/10/15,‘It’s time for govt. to conduct drive to ensure people wear masks: HC,"Asks action taken against those holding protests, dharna, rallies sans masks

The Karnataka High Court on Thursday said the time had come for the State government and local authorities like the BBMP to conduct very comprehensive drives to enforce norms of wearing masks and maintaining social distance as the number of positive cases were on the rise.

The only finding that we can record today is that these norms are not implemented in their letter and spirit and no serious effort is being made to enforce these norms, observed a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S Kinagi.

The Bench was hearing a petition filed by Letzkit Foundation, a city-based social organisation complaining about not wearing of masks and maintaining social distance, particularly the prominent personalities in public places.

As it was alleged by a counsel for the petitioner that the norms were violated during a recent rally, in which MP Tejaswi Surya, who is also an advocate, participated, the Bench directed the government to submit action-taken report on violations.

Referring to enforcing the norms in Bengaluru, which is leading in the country with the highest number of cases, the Bench wondered how a mere 198 marshals could enforce norm by imposing fine in a city with a population of 1.3 crore.

The Bench termed as “false” the government‘s claim of the norm of mask wearing was followed during the foundation laying ceremony for Kempegowda statue on Bengaluru airport premises on June 27 as the photos, produced by the government showed at least five people either not wearing masks or wearing them inappropriately.

However, the government counsel told the court that fine was collected from some of the invitees as the event was open only for invited guests and not the public.

The Bench, in another petition, directed the government to inform the action taken taken against those persons who had violated norms during the protests and dharnas held as part of bandh call given by various organisations on September 28.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fkxka2/article32777450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGMASK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/its-time-for-govt-to-conduct-drive-to-ensure-people-wear-masks-hc/article32865861.ece
112,2020/10/15,Most COVID-19 hospitals practising ‘rooming-in’ newborns with mothers,"Paediatricians say benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh potential risks of transmission

Following emerging evidence that transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby is very rare, most COVID-19 hospitals that were initially separating newborns from the infected mothers are now practising “rooming-in”.

Paediatricians, who assert that benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission, are of the view that COVID-19 antibodies in breast milk protect the babies. Hence, infected mothers are being advised to continue breastfeeding with adequate precautions.

WHO recommendation

While the World Health Organisation (WHO) also recommends that mothers with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 should be encouraged to initiate or continue breastfeeding, a recent research published in JAMA Paediatrics has found that mothers with COVID-19, who take basic precautions, rarely pass on the virus to their newborns. The study examined outcomes in the first 101 newborns born to infected mothers at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in the U.S. from March 13 to April 24, 2020. Of these, only two newborns tested positive, the study said.

Doctors in COVID-19 hospitals said very few babies have been infected although they have started following “rooming-in” (keeping the baby at a distance of six feet from the mother) concept. Venkat Reddy, nodal officer of COVID-19 ward at the State-run Hajee Sir Ismail Sait Gosha Hospital, that is now a dedicated COVID-19 maternity facility, said of the 182 babies born there, 10 have been infected so far.

Similarly, not more than four babies that were born to infected mothers in Trauma and Emergency Care Centre on Victoria Hospital campus have been infected. A team of doctors from the adjacent Vani Vilas Maternity Hospital conducted over 230 deliveries there till Gosha Hospital was identified as a dedicated COVID-19 maternity facility. “Although earlier, the babies were separated from the mothers and kept under isolation at Vani Vilas, breastfeeding was being allowed with adequate precautions. Hardly 3 to 4 babies got the infection,” said Geeta Shivamurthy, Vani Vilas Medical Superintendent.

Asha Benekappa, former director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, said breastfed infants have an advantage of receiving additional protection against SARS-CoV-2.

Antibodies against virus

“An infected mother produces antibodies against the virus, which is transmitted to the baby through breastfeeding. The immature immune system of the baby is protected by colostrum (the first milk), an immunological elixir, which the baby gets, if fed immediately after birth. Hence, breastfeeding should be encouraged, mothers and their babies should be cared for together, and skin-to-skin contact ensured,” she said.

“If mothers are too ill to breastfeed, they should still be supported to express their milk, and the infant should be fed by a healthy individual. ,” said Dr. Benkappa, who is now heads the Department of Paediatrics at Chandramma Dayananda Sagar Institute of Medical Education and Research.

N. Karthik Nagesh, chairman and HOD of Neonatology and NICUs at Manipal Hospitals Group, said it is important that the mother wears a mask, washes her hands, wipes the chest and the surface baby is going to come in contact with sanitiser or soap and water.

“We recommend zero separation in case if both mother and baby are healthy, partial separation in case mother is sick or if other relatives are available to look after the baby, and complete separation only if mother is very sick and requires ICU care or if the baby is sick and needs to be in the newborn ICU,” said Dr. Nagesh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/crxdpd/article32865858.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGBABY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/most-covid-19-hospitals-practising-rooming-in-newborns-with-mothers/article32865859.ece

115,2020/10/15,Three African cheetahs now on display at Mysuru zoo,"Housed in special enclosure; public can see them from Nov. 1

The century-old Mysuru zoo has become the second Indian zoo to house the famed African cheetahs as the fastest land animals were released for public display on Thursday.

A male and two female cheetahs that were received from a Cheetah conservation centre in South Africa under an animal exchange programme have been displayed in a specially-built enclosure.

Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar inaugurated the public display of the cheetahs. Zoo Authority of Karnataka Member Secretary B.P. Ravi, Zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni and others were present.

The three cheetahs, aged between 12 and 16 months, belonged to different parentages. The newly-constructed expansive enclosure for the cheetahs consists of a running track in tune with their habitat.

The zoo visitors, however, have to wait till November 1 to watch the cheetahs as Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri has ordered the closure of major tourist sites, including the Mysuru zoo, during the Dasara festive season over COVID-19 scare.

The cheetahs had arrived on August 17 and were in quarantine under close observation. The zoo had claimed that it was the country’s first international animal exchange post-COVID-19.

The Ann Van Dyk Cheetah Centre, South Africa, agreed to give the cheetahs under the exchange considering the Mysuru zoo’s standing. Though the zoo had got all approvals in December-January, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the cheetahs’ arrival.

The Mysuru zoo had earlier housed four African cheetahs which had been procured from Germany. However, they did not survive long.

Mysuru zoo is the second zoo after Hyderabad zoo to display cheetahs. The zoo had to pursue the proposals with various agencies in India and South Africa for getting clearances for the international exchange. A lot of paperwork was involved to realise the exchange and the Mysuru zoo’s reputation internationally helped in clinching the deal, according to the zoo authorities.

The quarantine enclosure was equipped with CCTVs whose visuals were closely monitored by a team of zoo vets. Only select keepers were allowed to feed the animals and no others were permitted to access the cheetahs’ room.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sugstl/article32863623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15MYSCHEETAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/three-african-cheetahs-now-on-display-at-mysuru-zoo/article32863246.ece

The contribution of Suttur Mutt to the field of education was lauded by Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan at a digital event held on Thursday.

Mr. Ashwath Narayan said the educational institutions run by the Suttur Mutt are a role model for others to emulate and had left a lasting impact on society. The digital event was held to mark the award distribution of QS I-Gauge Indian College and University Ratings to JSS Institutions.

QS I-GAUGE is a rating system for Indian universities and colleges and is based on the globally recognised QS Stars university ratings. Both QS Stars and QS I-GAUGE complement the QS World University Rankings, QS BRICS University Rankings, and other QS activities.

The Deputy Chief Minister said all educational institutions should keep pace with the changing world and adapt to modern technologies and be student-centric in their approach to impart education. JSS educational institutions were way ahead of others in this regard, he added.

Mr. Narayan said the role and contribution of the JSS Institutions to bring about improvements in the educational sphere was noteworthy and its emphasis on quality education was important to empower people and ensure social equity and social justice.

QS I-GAUGE provides Indian institutions an opportunity to effectively benchmark their performance and develop strategies for upgrading their educational services as well as the institutional performance. The parameters considered for QS I-GAUGE Rating are Teaching & Learning, Faculty Quality, Employability, Students Diversity, Facilities, Social Responsibilities, Faculty Diversity, Entrepreneurship, Research and Arts & Culture

JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, JSS Academy of Technical Education, Bengaluru, JSS College of Arts, Commerce and Science, JSS Institute of Speech and Hearing, JSS College for Women, JSS Ayurvedic Medical College, JSS College of Nursing, JSS College of Physiotherapy, participated in the QS I-Gauge audit from October 2019. While the JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research received the highest “Diamond“ Rating, other institutions received gold rating, the authorities said.

117,2020/10/15,MUDA to push for vertical growth to overcome land scarcity,"The Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) will ditch plans for bulk allotment of individual sites in new layouts in future and focus on vertical growth of the city.

The vertical growth areas will be designated beyond the existing heritage zones and tourist centres. More over, it will also entail increasing the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) – the ratio of the building’s floor area to that of the land on which it is constructed - to enable construction of multi-storeyed structures going beyond 10 or 12 floors.

MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajeev told The Hindu that the horizontal sprawl of the city can no longer be sustained and people were reluctant to settle beyond a few km outside the city limits while Mysuru has already spread beyond 10 to 12 km radius.

‘’Long-time residents of the city seeking to construct a new house no longer see any merit in going beyond 10 km and are exploring apartments within the city limits’’, said Mr. Rajeev.

In the meantime, the group housing plan proposed by MUDA a few years ago will be the first exercise in continuation of this vision of vertical growth and the plans will be submitted to the State government for approval in due course.

The MUDA has swathes of land at 33 different locations within and close to the city limits and another 15 will be added to take up high-rise apartments under group housing scheme.

“’In the first phase around 5,000 housing units will be built each costing not more than ₹12 lakh to ₹ 15 lakh to make it truly affordable’’, said Mr. Rajeev.

The growing realisation of the unsustainability of horizontal sprawl which was eating into agricultural tracts around Mysuru, was also a factor that triggered MUDA’s plans to opt for vertical growth.

There has been bulk conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes in Mysuru taluk and the recent amendment to the Land Reforms (Amendment) Act 2020 easing the purchase of agricultural lands, will only accelerate the conversion process.

“On a swathe of converted land where 2,000 sites can be created the MUDA can construct apartment blocks to accommodate manifold that number and hence this was the only way forward to cater to site aspirants’’, said the MUDA Chairman.

Mr. Rajeev said he will convene a meeting in the month of November with officials and all stakeholders to discuss the future plans and chalk out a vision for both MUDA and Mysuru.

For people who prefer row housing despite the distance factor, there will be options but the focus will be on vertical growth in future.

The last bulk allotment of individual sites by MUDA was at R.T.Nagar where nearly 1,680 sites were distributed. But the entire process – from land acquisition to development and allotment – which began in 1997 was completed only in 2017 by when the number of site aspirants had grown manifold. Vertical growth is expected to reduce this pendency and cater to more people.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8sqhxl/article32868152.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15MYSMUDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/muda-to-push-for-vertical-growth-to-overcome-land-scarcity/article32862413.ece

“Kalaburagi district has only one NDRF team and it is not able to handle the flood situation all alone. I appeal to the government to put one more NDRF team. The government should also pay compensation of ₹10,000 an acre to all flood-hit farmers. We, the Congress party, are ready to assist and help the government in handling the flood situation.

121,2020/10/15,"5-km running, walking made mandatory for reserve police in this month","Aim is to improve their immunity, fight against COVID-19

Talking forward the Fit India initiative and bringing in fitness regime among reserve police personnel, Additional Director General of Police (Karnataka State Reserve Police) Alok Kumar has made it mandatory for the personnel to run/walk for 5 km every day during October.

“Physical fitness alone can improve our immunity and help us fight against COVID-19 infection. We are trying to inculcate culture of fitness among the personnel,” Mr. Kumar told The Hindu after taking part in the “Fit Mangaluru” run organised jointly by the KSRP and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited here on Thursday.

A circular has been issued to commandants of all KSRP battalions to ensure that the reserve police personnel aged below 40 run for 5 km every day. Those aged between 40 and 50 should run and walk for the same distance. The personnel aged above 50 km have to walk 5 km every day. This one-month-long activity will culminate on the National Unity Day on October 31 when the KSRP personnel from across the State will take part in a cyclothon in Bengaluru, which will be flagged off by Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, he said.

The culture of physical fitness is being re-emphasised following deaths of some of reserve police personnel, some of whom were aged below 30, due to co-morbidities. As part of the fitness regime, personnel are also asked to do breathing exercises regularly. “Rather than just saying it, officers, including myself, take the lead in following this regime by complying with use of face mask, social distance and other safety protocols,” he said.

Every battalion, he said, has categorised personnel into A (without ailment),B (off and on ailment) and C (with perennial health issues). “We are motivating personnel to follow treatment protocol and move up from C to B and B to A. We do not want those in A to move down,” he said. Weight of the personnel is being monitored regularly at the battalion and those indulging in chronic smoking and alcohol consumption are undergoing de-addiction sessions, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5-km-running-walking-made-mandatory-for-reserve-police-in-this-month/article32861199.ece

123,2020/10/15,BJP using police to intimidate party candidate: DKS,"He objects to a case being registered against Kusuma in R.R. Nagar constituency

KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar on Thursday accused the BJP and the State government of using the police to intimidate the Congress candidate and party cadre in Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituency. This follows a case being registered against Kusuma H., Congress candidate in the segment in Bengaluru.

The party would submit a complaint against the BJP to the Election Commission on the alleged misuse of the State machinery by the government, he said.

The police on Wednesday registered the case against Ms. Kusuma for allegedly causing disturbance to the police personnel on duty while filing nomination papers at the BBMP office. The FIR was registered against the candidate at the Kengeri police station for “deterring a public servant from performing duty”.

Addressing mediapersons at his residence on Thursday, Mr. Shivakumar said, “We have drone footage of what happened while filing nominations. Within 100 metres of the barricade, there were two BJP Ministers and five MLAs and there were leaders from all political parties. Why could the police not register cases against them?”

The KPCC chief alleged that the State government was hand in glove with the police and it was trying to intimidate Ms. Kusuma as she was new to politics. He demanded transfer of a circle inspector who registered a “false case” against the Congress candidate.

Mr. Shivakumar and Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah accompanied Ms. Kusuma during the filing of nomination papers on Wednesday.

BJP workers were “dancing around” the BBMP office during filing of nominations, Mr. Shivakumar said. “Did they not violate the model code of conduct? We will go to the Election Commission and expose the dirty politics of the BJP to the voters,” he added.

The polling will be held on November 3.

124,2020/10/15,Karnataka CCB raids Vivek Oberoi’s residence in Mumbai in search of Aditya Alva,"Aditya Alva, on of the prime accused in Kannada film drugs case is Vivek Oberoi’s brother-in-law

Central Crime Branch police teams have conducted raid on Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi’s residence in Mumbai after receiving a tip-off that one of the prime accused in the drug case they are probing, Aditya Alva,was hiding there.

Mr. Aditya, who is the son of the late minister Jeevaraj Alva and Oberoi’s brother-in-law, has been absconding ever since he was accused of being a part of the drug racket involving Kannada film stars, dealers and party organisers.

“Acting on information that Aditya was hiding in his brother-in-law’s house in Mumbai, the CCB obtained a search warrant from the court. The search is still on,” said Joint Commissioner (Crime) Sandeep Patil.

The CCB is expected to question Mr. Oberoi and his family members on Aditya’s whereabouts, said sources.

The search comes days after the police questioned Ricky Rai — the son of former underworld don-turned-social activist Muthappa Rai. At the time they had searched his apartment in Sadashivnagar and the family house in Bidadi as they believed that Mr. Aditya was hiding there. Mr. Ricky’s mobile phone had been seized and he was detained for questioning.

Many of the accused who have been arrested in connection with the drug case allegedly partied at a farmhouse in Hebbal owned by Mr. Aditya on weekends where drugs were sold and used.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9jhfst/article31970765.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Vivek-Oberoi-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-ccb-raids-vivek-oberois-residence-in-mumbai-in-search-of-aditya-alva/article32860728.ece
125,2020/10/15,"Borrow money from banks to pay compensation, HC tells govt., MCC","Court speaks up for victims of landfill disaster in Mangaluru

The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday said that the State government and the Mangalore City Corporation (MCC) must make arrangements even by borrowing money from banks by mortgaging properties of the MCC to pay adequate compensation to the persons who lost their houses, land and crops due to slippage of garbage dumped at Pachhanadi landfill during rains last year.

The Court issued the direction after the MCC said that it has paid compensation partly as the government has released only ₹8 crore as against ₹22 crore sought for paying compensation and to remove the legacy waste from the landfill. The government, on the other hand, said that it cannot pay more to the MCC, which has to make arrangements from its own resources by utilising part of money from ₹8 crore even to pay compensation.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition, filed by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority, which had pointed out the plight of the victims of Pachhanadi incident and non-implementation of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, by the MCC.

The Bench also told the government that it cannot be a silent spectator when failure of a local authority to implement rules results in violation of fundamental rights of the citizen, while hoping that the government would change its stand and release necessary funds to the MCC.

The Bench said that it is crystal clear from the records that the Pachhanadi incident, which had resulted in loss of properties and livelihood of several families in violation of their fundamental right, occurred due to complete failure to abide by the SMW Rules and gross negligence by the MCC.

Noticing that the MCC has unilaterally paid compensation only for loss of crops and trees without inviting any claims from the affected persons and without giving them an opportunity of hearing, the Bench directed the MCC Commissioner to personally explain through videoconference during next date of hearing how the MCC will raise money to pay adequate compensation and implement the rules.

The MCC has also been directed to give a public notice inviting the affected persons to submit claims by submitting documents and to give them proper hearing before determining adequate compensation, which cannot be less than what has been paid already, taking into account loss of houses, lands, crops, other assets and livelihood.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/n3jomo/article32823401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10KRAKARHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/borrow-money-from-banks-to-pay-compensation-hc-tells-govt-mcc/article32859575.ece
126,2020/10/15,"In Sira constituency, seers may have a big say in voters’ choice","The three major parties have all fielded Vokkaliga candidates

With the announcement of byelections to two Legislative Assembly constituencies in the State, candidates have started hopping from one mutt to another seeking blessings of seers belonging to various castes/communities.

In Sira constituency, besides seers of Sri Siddaganga Mutt, those of nearly a dozen mutts in Tumakuru district and the neighbouring Chitradurga district are expected to play a key role.

Political analysts say that each mutt owing allegiance to a particular community — Vokkaliga, Lingayat, Kuruba, Madiga — sometimes openly, but mostly wielding the influence behind the scenes, would help in garnering votes. In fact, some political leaders too have been openly identified with a particular mutt.

All the three major political parties have fielded candidates belonging to the Vokkaliga community in the constituency — T.B. Jayachandra (Congress), Rajesh Gowda (BJP), and Ammajamma (JD-S) — and they are vying for support of seers to ensure victory in election scheduled for November 3.

Nanjavadoota Swamy of Pattanayakanahalli in Sira, Hanumanthanatha Swamy of Yelerampura, Koratagere, and Shantaveera Swamy of Hosadurga, all belonging to the Vokkaliga community, are expected to play an important role swaying voters. There are an estimated 58,000 voters belonging to the Vokkaliga community and the three candidates would fiercely compete to get the community support, said sources in the Congress.

To influence voters

Two seers belonging to the Madiga community — Madara Chennaiah Swamy, Chitradurga, and Markandeya Swamy, Hiriyur, — are expected to influence voters belonging to the Scheduled Caste (Left). The community has an estimated 31,000 voters. There are about 7,500 voters belonging to the SC (Right).

Candidates would also seek blessings of seers belonging to Bhovi, Kuruba, and Golla communities too. Bhovi community seer Immadi Siddarameshwara Swamy of Chitradurga would wield influence over about 4,500 members of the community. Eshwaranandapuri Swamy of Hosadurga, representing the Kuruba community, is expected to influence about 17,000 voters of the community. The Golla community voters would be seeking directions from their seer Yadavannada Swamy of Chitradurga. The community has an estimated 20,000 votes. Members of the Sathya Sai Seva Organisation, which runs a residential school in Sira, too are expected to plays a role in the elections.

Unlike many other constituencies, the dominant Lingayat community has fewer number voters — an estimated 4,000 — in this constituency, sources said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/u8zubq/article32857937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGSIDDAGANGAMUTT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/in-sira-constituency-seers-may-have-a-big-say-in-voters-choice/article32857938.ece

129,2020/10/15,Kanam sees no reason to oppose Mani,"CPI hails KC(M)’s pro-farmer policies

CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran on Thursday said he saw no reason to treat the Jose. K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) as a political opponent.

The decision of Mr. Mani to work in league with the LDF without setting any condition reflected his affinity towards the pro-farmer policies of the ruling front. The CPI had opposed Mr. Mani when he was aligned with the UDF and opposed to the policies of the LDF.

Now, Mr. Mani has unilaterally and unconditionally declared his support to the LDF and disavowed the UDF camp. So there was no reason to oppose Mr. Mani any more or treat the KC(M) faction headed by him antagonistically.

However, Mr. Rajendran seemed unwilling to comment publicly whether the CPI would back Mr. Mani's admission to the LDF. He said the CPI State executive would meet on October 21 and decide the party's position on Mr. Mani.

The CPI would present its decision at the LDF meeting. The LDF would discuss the matter and make a formal announcement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kanam-sees-no-reason-to-oppose-mani/article32865469.ece

131,2020/10/15,Kerala reports more COVID-19 cases than national average,"But fatality rate continues to be the lowest: CM

COVID-19 transmission in Kerala has reached a stage wherein the State is now reporting more cases than the national average.

Kerala is now reporting 8,911 cases per 10 lakh population against the national average of 6,974 per 10 lakh, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. The State has accordingly hiked the number of tests, he said.

However, even while the case graph in the State is climbing, Kerala’s case fatality rate continued to be the lowest at 0.34% against the national average of 1.6%, which was a sign of the robustness and efficiency of the State’s public health system, he said.

Managing surge

Now that the transmission has become intense with more people requiring hospital admission, the Health Department was focusing on managing surge capacity and ensuring that hospitals did not run out of ICU beds or ventilators to care for critically ill patients, Mr. Vijayan, said.

In both government and private sector, as many hospital beds and ICU beds as possible should be set aside for COVID patients. In every district, private hospitals had been asked to give at least 10% of the beds for COVID care.

Case reporting

Private hospitals should cooperate with the government to provide COVID care to people by providing a clear audit of the available ICU beds and ventilators on a daily basis, Mr. Vijayan said.

Private hospitals should report the bed occupancy position as well as data on ICU beds and ventilators promptly to the government so that these could be displayed on the government's dashboard, he said.

Hand washing

On the occasion of Global Hand washing day on Thursday, Mr. Vijayan pointed out that all hand washing facilities that had been set up in public places as part of the ‘Break the Chain’ campaign were in disuse now.

The appointment of gazetted officers as sectoral magistrates to monitor COVID prevention and control activities were giving good results and more officials should come forward to act, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/3xxinf/article31858037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/muraljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-reports-more-cases-than-national-average/article32865370.ece
132,2020/10/15,Humanism remained an enduring ideology for Akkitham,"His poetry was imbued with a sense of ecological justice

The debate whether Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri was a bundle of contradictions will go on.

In his exuberant youth, he flicked away the poonool (the thread worn by Brahmins), feasted on fish, and took to Communist ideology against the orthodox practices of his community. Years later, he reached for the old poonool, returned to vegetarianism and though he had parted ways with Communism soon after the ‘Calcutta thesis’, in his twilight years, he was seen endorsing the Hindu right-wing culturally.

But his poetry, from beginning till end was imbued with a rare humanism and what poet K.G. Sankara Pillai would call a “sense of ecological justice”.

He never surrendered humanism and it remained as an enduring ideology.

This was evident even when he construed a modern city as a temple, a feudal image that went against the very grain of the modernism that had characterised his ‘epic’ poem.

No other poet in Malayalam, says Pillai, was able to give brilliantly abstract poetic expression to the deep, subtle state of being one with nature. He cites Ninne Konnavar Konnu Poove/ Thannude Thanne Mokshathe (Those who killed you, flower/ Killed their own salvation) as a shining example.

Back in 2012, at the screening of a biopic on the poet, artist M.V. Devan, who had done illustrations for Akkitham’s Irupatham Noottandinte Ithihasam (The Epic of the 20th Century), which was published in Mathrubhumi Weekly on August 31, 1952, recalled how Akkitham’s poetry outlined the contours of his own spiritual journey and therefore touched his readers’ soul.

G. Prabha, academic who canned the biopic, says there was no duality in the poet’s standpoints, as he was forever a worshipper of nature. “This was different from the caste-driven ethos spoken of as Indian these days. It was almost animist and he felt for everything in nature.”

His humanism took him to Gandhi and over time, mistakenly to the groups he would be seen with in the later years of his life, says Mr. Prabha.

Critic M. Thomas Mathew is categorical when he says there was no dichotomy in Akkitham’s stances. “His spiritual quest was unwavering and genuine. He was never communal. Our renaissance leaders are also those touted by revivalists as their icons. That’s the dichotomy of Indian society. That apart, as far as I knew, Akkitham never really joined any camp. He ploughed a lone furrow, says Mr. Mathew.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/io6l9k/article32864720.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Akkitham---Copy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/humanism-remained-an-enduring-ideology-for-akkitham/article32864710.ece

134,2020/10/15,"HC warns against publishing, leaking of confession statement","Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan made the observation while granting bail to Jollyamma Joseph, an accused in one of the Koodathayi serial murder cases.

The Kerala High Court on Friday warned that stringent action would be taken against media and police officers if extra-judicial confession to the police or other information obtained during investigation was leaked out or published in the media.

Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan made the observation while granting bail to Jollyamma Joseph, an accused in one of the Koodathayi serial murder cases. She was granted bail in a case relating to the murder of her mother-in-law Annamma Thomas in August 2002.

The court noted that the extra-judicial confession of the accused in the Koodathayi murders and other details of the investigation were leaked out to the media. The court had directed the police in 2011 not to leak out investigation details to the media.

In fact, the confession statement of an accused might not be admissible as evidence legally. If a court of law decided a case based on legal evidence, the general public may suspect even the judiciary if the present situation of divulging confession statement and other information collected during investigation continued. A full stop was necessary.

The court observed that investigating officers should be careful at least in future. If there was any violation of the directives by police officers, disciplinary action should be taken against them, the court ordered.

“My respectful request to the reporters of print and visual media and, of course, to the anchors of 24-hour news channels is to read Section 24 of the Evidence Act and other similar sections before framing headlines in newspapers and before giving breaking news in news channels based on confession statements of the accused who are in police custody,” the court said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4pkyzi/article32412177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KERALAHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-warns-against-publishing-leaking-of-confession-statement/article32864418.ece
135,2020/10/15,Petitioner in landmark SC judgment dead,"Bijoe Emmanuel vs. State of Kerala case is one of the pillars of free speech

V.J. Emmanuel, a retired college teacher, on whose petition the Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgment on the freedom of expression, died due to age-related ailments here on Wednesday evening. He was 78. He is survived by wife, five daughters, and a son.

Emmanuel, who retired from the Department of English at KE College, Mannam, was an ardent preacher of the Jehovah’s Witnesses sect. The funeral was held at his family’s residence at Koodalloor on Thursday .

The case, Bijoe Emmanuel vs State of Kerala, in which he challenged the State Department of Education in 1986, stands as one of the pillars of free speech in India. It pertained to the suspension of his children Bijoe Emmanuel, a Class 10 student, Binu, and Bindu from their school at Kidangoor on July 26, 1986 on the ground that they refused to recite the national anthem during the morning assemblies.

In their response, the students held that singing the national anthem was against the tenets of their religious faith. Though a single-member commission appointed by the government found that the students showed no disrespect to the national anthem, they, along with nine other students from the same sect, were suspended from the school on the instruction of the Education Department.

Emmanuel filed a writ petition in the Kerala High Court seeking to restrain authorities from preventing their school attendance, though to no avail. He subsequently appealed the decision in the Supreme Court, which found that their expulsion was in violation Articles 19 and 25 of the Constitution and held that “no provisions of law in the country expressly obligates individuals to sing the national anthem”.

Armed with the Supreme Court order, Emmanuel got his children readmitted to the school but the family then decided not to continue formal schooling for any of their seven children.

“All of us completed education through parallel schooling and then submitted ourselves in service to God, as wished by our father,” says Bindu, one of Emmanuel’s daughters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/n9329t/article32866201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201015-WA0021,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/petitioner-in-landmark-sc-judgment-dead/article32864394.ece
136,2020/10/15,UDF unfazed by Mani’s defection,"Traditional base of KC(M) unlikely to shift allegiance to LDF, feels P. J. Jossph

A meeting of the United Democratic Front (UDF) here on Thursday settled that the desertion of the alliance by the Jose. K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) would scarcely dent the electoral prospects of the opposition alliance in central Travancore in the forthcoming local body and Assembly elections.

Mr Mani’s arch-rival in the KC (M), P. J. Joseph, reportedly assured the meeting that the party's traditional base was unlikely to shift its loyalty to the Left Democratic Front (LDF) merely because an individual leader had played turncoat.

Mr Joseph ‘claimed’ that KC (M) workers were abandoning Mr. Mani in the heartland of the party in Kottayam. The trickle would soon become a flood.

Mr. Joseph reportedly exuded confidence that the UDF would hold its ground against the ruling front despite Mr. Mani’s shift in political allegiance.

It noted that the CPI had reservations about Mr. Mani's inclusion. So did the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) whose Pala seat was at stake given Mr. Mani’s strong pitch for the constituency.

NCP leader and Pala MLA Mani. C. Kappan ‘feared’ that Mr. Mani would displace him. So did other Kerala Congress splinter groups in the LDF.

IUML leader, P. K. Kunhalikutty reportedly opined that Mr. Mani would be hard-pressed to explain his defection to KC(M) supporters.

Moreover, the political atmosphere was conducive to a UDF win, and traditional UDF voters in central Travancore had little incentive to give the Pinarayi Vijayan government a second term in office.

At a media briefing later, UDF convenor M. M Hassan demanded that Mr. Mani give up the Lok Sabha and two Assembly seats his faction had won at the expense of the opposition alliance.

Mr. Mani's defection has accorded no political advantage to the LDF. The UDF would meet on November 23 in Kochi to weigh the political situation. Forward Bloc national secretary G. Devarajan and CMP leader C. P. John were among those present.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udf-unfazed-by-manis-defection/article32864248.ece
137,2020/10/15,KC(M) begins consultations with LDF,"Party likely to get five seats in Kottayam, one in Idukki and five in other districts

A day after announcing the party’s decision with the Left Democratic Front, Kerala Congress (M) factional leader Jose K. Mani on Thursday kickstarted consultations with the coalition leaders in this regard.

Official sources said only a few formalities remain for the regional party to find a berth in the left coalition. According to them, the party was likely to get five seats in Kottayam including Pala, Poonjar and Changanassery, besides one seat in Idukki and five seats in various other districts.

The decision to align with the LDF presents a major challenge to Mr.Mani to prove his strength in Central Travancore politics that has been deeply rooted in the political matrix of Syro-Malabar Church.

While the votes under the church are traditionally considered as pro-UDF, unprecedented fissures in the voter base that appeared of late presents an opportunity for the party during the upcoming elections.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Mani had asserted his party's claim over the Rajya Sabha seat, which became vacant due to his decision to resign from the post.

“Considering the influence that the KC(M) enjoys as a party, we deserve that seat,” he said, while also expressing hope that the party would get appropriate representation during the upcoming local body elections.

Notwithstanding a statement from Mani C. Kappen, MLA asserting the decision of his party to stay firm with the LDF, speculations are now rife about him exploring options to join the United Democratic Front (UDF) to contest from the Pala seat once again.

In case if the NCP decides to exit the LDF, the Mani group may also get the Kuttanad seat to contest from.

Meanwhile, the UDF looks to fill in the vacuum created by the Mani group’s exit by poaching the UDF sympathisers from the breakaway faction . According to sources, the KC(M) faction led by P.J. Joseph has reached out to the KC (M) leaders and workers, who have apprehensions about the party’s move to the Left camp.

To make most of the opportunity, the party will highlight the ‘bitter treatment' of K.M .Mani, founder leader of the KC (M), by the left parties during the bar -bribery case.

The Congress, at the same time, too looks to firm up its position in the district by taking over a few seats previously contested by the Mani group.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/blkm3o/article32866040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tv-jose-k-mani,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kcm-begins-consultations-with-ldf/article32864126.ece
138,2020/10/15,Nothing to substantiate terror funding: NIA court,"10 accused in gold smuggling case get bail

The 90 days of National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe into the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case has failed to “trace out any material to substantiate” the suspicion that the proceeds of the smuggling were used for terror funding, ordered NIA Special Court, Kochi.

Releasing 10 accused on bail, NIA Special Judge P. Krishnakumar noted that it was obvious from the case diary that some of the petitioners had only funded the frontline accused persons for smuggling the gold through the diplomatic channel and they had conspired with them in that respect.

It was “beyond any dispute that mere act of smuggling gold would not attract the offence of terrorist act, unless it is coupled with certain other elements, which at least suggest the broad probability of an intentional act to threaten the economic security of India,” noted the judge while refusing to accept the prosecution allegation against the petitioners.

The prosecution case was that the accused committed a terrorist act by funding and conspiring with the other accused persons for smuggling gold through diplomatic cargo and hence punishable under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

Section 15

A careful reading of Section 15 of the Act leaves no doubt that the act of smuggling of gold to India from abroad would attract the said provision only if it was done ‘with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the economic security of India.’ Also, the intention to destroy economic security, and not just the knowledge, was required to justify the slapping of the Act, the court noted.

However, the court declined bail to P. Mohammed Shafi, Muhammed Ali, and K.T. Sharafuddeen considering the seriousness of the charges against them and the findings against them in the case diary. The bail application of Swapna Suresh and P.S. Sarith were withdrawn by their lawyers on the day.

Even though, noted the judge, the NIA repeatedly alleged that the petitioners acted with an intention to damage the economic security of India, there was no material whatsoever in the case diary to prima facie satisfy the charge.

However, there were sufficient materials to show that the petitioners conspired with some of the accused to smuggle gold to India. Yet, there was “nothing in the case diary to show that the money spend by them was coming from any terror outfits or that they received the gold for transferring it to any such dark forces or even their connection whatsoever with any terrorist forces.” the judge noted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mh0psu/article30634807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-NIA-SUDERSHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nothing-to-substantiate-terror-funding-nia-court/article32864036.ece
139,2020/10/15,State’s first water taxi launched,"Chief Minister also launches catamaran boat service of State Water Transport Department

Traffic congestion and pollution will encourage more people to use water transport, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

He was virtually launching the State’s first water taxi and a catamaran boat service of the State Water Transport Department (SWTD) here on Thursday. Mr. Vijayan said that both could be used by the public and tourists alike. Speaking on the importance of waterways in the development of the State, the Chief Minister said that the government was committed to completing the Kovalam-Kasaragod waterway.

The water taxi, a catamaran diesel-powered craft, with a seating capacity for 10 passengers, will pick passengers and drop them at their destination. It has enhanced safety and can cruise at a maximum speed of 19 knots (35 km/hour). The vessel has been constructed by Kochi-based Navgathi Marine Design and Constructions Private Ltd., which built the country’s first solar ferry, Aditya. The boat comes with a 250-horse power outboard diesel engine imported from Sweden. Besides, it has an electric power steering and solar panel atop to provide enough electric energy to fulfil all the power requirements, including lights, fan, and control system. Owing to its smaller size, the craft can reach anywhere.

Tariffs

Officials said that the tariff fixed had been ₹750 for 30 minutes and ₹1,500 per hour. The water taxi service would begin on a commercial basis from October 26. The SWTD plans to launch a total of four water taxis at a cost of ₹3.14 crore. Location and launch of the rest of the three boats will be decided later.

The second catamaran boat launched has the capacity to carry 100 passengers. The boat has enhanced safety measures and modern facilities. It has a length of 20.5 m and a width of seven m. The vessel can achieve a maximum speed of seven nautical miles. The SWTD plans to introduce six more such boats.

Water Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran presided. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac, A.M. Ariff, MP, and others attended the function held near Alappuzha boat jetty.

Following are the contact numbers for hiring a water taxi: 9400050325/9400050346.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/states-first-water-taxi-launched/article32863634.ece
140,2020/10/15,Idukki water nearing orange alert level,"Though there is a lull in rainfall, heavy inflow through the Periyar and tributaries continues

Despite the increased power generation at the Moolamattom powerhouse, the water level in the Idukki reservoir was nearing the orange alert level on Thursday.

The water level at 4 p.m. was 2,392.82 ft. As per the new rule curve fixed by the Central Water Commission, the orange alert level is 2,396.85 ft and the red alert level 2,397.85 ft. The dam has to be opened once the water level reaches 2,398.85 ft.

An official at the Dam Monitoring and Research Station at Vazhathoppe said the water level was high now compared to the water level during the same period in the past two years. In 2018, when the dam was opened in the August floods, the water level on October 15 was 2,387 ft and last year it was 2,376.3 ft.

The official said the water level was higher last year compared to the previous year because the dam was not opened. However, it was rare that water level increased to this level by the middle of October, as per the data available with the Kerala State Electricity Board. The catchment area recorded a rainfall of 29 mm on Thursday.

Though there was a lull in rainfall on Thursday, there was heavy inflow through the Periyar and other tributaries resulting in nearly one ft rise in the water level in the past 24 hours. Since power generation had been increased, the water level was being monitored every three hours and changes made to generation levels.

A senior official at the dam safety wing said an unpredictable weather condition was prevailing now. Though the rainfall was much lower on Thursday, there was prediction of a depression over the Bay of Bengal.

He said the water level continued to increase as a result of the heavy rainfall in the past two days. The inflow was three times higher than the powerhouse discharge. The opening of the dam shutters depended on rainfall, inflow, and the situation downstream.

If the rain gained momentum and inflow became heavy in the coming days, the shutters could be opened prior to the level for water release fixed as per the new rule curve level, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/idukki-water-nearing-orange-alert-level/article32863613.ece
141,2020/10/15,"Greening drive sets up 1,261 ‘islets’","CM inaugurates Pachathuruthu, says more green spaces will be created

More green spaces should be set up to make the State carbon-neutral, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. He was inaugurating through videoconference here on Thursday 1,261 Pachathuruthu (green islets) set up by the Haritha Kerala Mission across the State.

Mr. Vijayan said against a target of 1,000 islets, the mission could set up 1,261. Every year, more such spaces should be set up. If there was no common land, Pachathuruthu should be promoted on land owned by people interested in greening the earth.

On 454 acres

The setting up of green spaces across 454 acres in the State was an investment in our future, Mr. Vijayan said. With trees, shrubs, medicinal plants, and biofencing in one place, these were small models of biodiversity. The project envisaged not only planting of saplings but also their nurture for three years. MGNREGS workers, local conservation committees, and students were all part of the initiative.

Suitable plants

Each green space was set up by selecting plants suitable to the area. The first Pachathuruthu in the State at Vengode at Pothencode in Thiruvananthapuram had rare medicinal plants grown with the support of JNTBGRI, Palode. In some places, there was only bamboo, and in others, fruit-bearing trees. In the backwaters and on beaches, mangroves were planted. Sacred groves were expanded to create Pachathuruthu in some places.

A visible change

The initiative, Mr. Vijayan said, had created a visible difference in the ecosystem in the past one year. The mangroves planted at Kumarakom had increased the fish wealth there. In other spaces, birds and insects had benefited.

C. Divakaran, MLA, planted a tree sapling at the 1,261st greenhouse that was completed in Nedumangad block in the district. T.N. Seema, executive vice chairperson of Haritha Kerala Mission, was present.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/flwekf/article32863596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vengodu1-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/greening-drive-sets-up-1261-islets/article32863597.ece
142,2020/10/15,Kerala on a sticky wicket over GST compensation,"20 States get nod to borrow from open market to meet shortfall

Kerala, which led the States to oppose the Centre’s twin options on Goods and Service Tax (GST) compensation, is on a sticky wicket as 20 States have got the nod to borrow from the open market as per Option I of the borrowing to meet the GST compensation shortfall.

Though the State is preparing the ground work to approach the Supreme Court against the Centre’s decision, as the GST Council has not taken a decision after three meetings, pressure on the States opposing the options is a concern.

Maharashtra, which stood with Kerala, has changed its stance and can now borrow ₹15,394 crore after choosing Option I that allows the State to borrow up to ₹1.1 lakh crore through a special window and principal and interest to be paid out of compensation cess. The 20 States have been allowed to borrow ₹68,825 crore.

Kerala, which was looking forward to about ₹7,000-crore GST compensation arrears from March 2020 to overcome the financial crisis, has not benefited from the compensation of ₹20,000 crore to States towards loss of revenue during 2020-21 and ₹25,000 crore towards Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) of 2017-18 announced after the 42nd GST Council meeting on October 5.

While ₹915 crore reached the treasury on October 5 night itself from the ₹20,000-crore compensation towards loss of revenue, official sources say ₹834 crore from the ₹25,000 crore towards IGST of 2017-18 is yet to be made available.

The State has also not benefited from the ₹12,000-crore interest-free 50-year loan announced to States for capital projects as part of a plan to boost economic activities. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has said Kerala will get only ₹200 crore as per the yardsticks fixed by the Centre, which was not enough to meet the goals.

Thus, the State will get only ₹1,949 crore from the compensation towards loss of revenue during 2020-2021, IGST, and the stimulus package.

K.J. Joseph, Director of the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation, says the approach of the Centre in evolving a stimulus package is apparently based on faulty premises and indicative of its faith in the trickle down theory. “The package will not give any stimulus. There is no guarantee that the privileged government officials will spend money on white goods. Unless the money directly reaches the needy, there will not be any stimulus,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-on-a-sticky-wicket-over-gst-compensation/article32863585.ece
143,2020/10/15,Rahul denied permission to open school building online,"UDF alleges conspiracy by the ruling front

The Wayanad district administration on Thursday denied permission for the online inaugural function of the newly constructed Plus Two building of the Government Vocational Higher Secondary School at Mundery by Rahul Gandhi, MP, since the organisers failed to seek the prior approval of the parental agency, the State Minority Directorate.

The building was constructed by the District Nirmithi Kendra at a cost of ₹1.2 crore under the Multi Sectoral Development Programme (MSDP).

When the organisers of the programme, the Kalpetta municipality and the school authorities, had made all arrangements for the online inaugural function at 10.30 a.m. on the day, Wayanad District Collector Adeela Abdulla denied permission for the function.

Ms. Adeela told The Hindu that the permission for programme was denied as per the direction of the State Minority Directorate as the organisers had not sought prior approval of the directorate for the programme.

The funding for the MSDP works have been provided by the Centre and the State at a proportion of 60:40. The implementing officer of the projects was the secretary of the block panchayat concerned and there were no role for the local bodies such as grama panchayat or municipality. A district-level committee chaired by the District Collector would monitor the project, Ms. Adeela said.

However, the United Democratic Front (UDF) district committee alleged that it was a conspiracy of the ruling front to tarnish the image of Mr. Gandhi by using the District Collector. They also took out a march to the municipal office here and staged a dharna in front of the collectorate in protest against the move.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kojroa/article32866192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvwydharnaudfdistrictcommittee,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rahul-denied-permission-to-open-school-building-online/article32863380.ece
144,2020/10/15,IAV’s first phase becomes operational at Thonnakkal,"Virology institute a potent weapon against epidemics: CM

The Institute of Advanced Virology (IAV) in the district will evolve into a global centre for high-end virology research and help Kerala scale greater heights in its efforts to improve public health and contain virus outbreaks, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

The first phase of IAV, situated at the Bio 360 Life Science Park at Thonnakkal, became functional with two divisions on Thursday. Dedicating the facility to the State at an online function, the Chief Minister said it was heartening to note that IAV has become functional at a time when Kerala is battling the COVID-19 pandemic.

Institutes such as the IAV will enable high-end medical research and give more teeth to the State’s efforts to tackle epidemics, Mr. Vijayan said. The constant interaction of Keralites with people of other States and nationalities also means that it is easier for epidemics to find their way into the State.

A robust public health system has helped Kerala effectively check the Nipah virus outbreak of 2018 and fight the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, such a system alone will not help the State tackle lifestyle diseases or epidemics. Institutes such as the IAV gain relevance in this context, according to him.

In 2017

The State government took the decision to establish a high-end research facility in virology in 2017. According to the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE), the IAV “is envisioned as an institute of global standards networking Global Virology Institutes with most modern laboratories focusing on research, diagnosis and management of emerging and re-emerging infectious viral diseases.”

The Phase 1 A building of the IAV was inaugurated in February 2019. On Thursday, the divisions on clinical virology and viral diagnostics became operational in a 25,000 sq ft pre-fab building. Once fully functional, the IAV will have eight scientific divisions on multiple aspects of virology research and occupy an 80,000 sq ft building at the park.

Director

Akhil C. Banerjee has taken charge as IAV director, and Mohanan Valiyaveetil, as the Senior Principal Scientist.

The Chief Minister said the IAV would work closely with national-level institutions such as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST), and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER).

Now functioning under the KSCSTE, the IAV will gain the status of an autonomous institution once it is fully functional, according to the government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5kcxgw/article32863178.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRTM-509-4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iavs-first-phase-becomes-operational-at-thonnakkal/article32863179.ece
145,2020/10/15,CWW seeks govt. nod to act against elephant traders,"Officer seeks withdrawal of order prohibiting action against ‘organised mafia’

Listing out the wildlife crimes allegedly committed by elephant traders A.V. Prasanth and V. Shaji and the cases booked against them, the Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW) has urged the State government to withdraw its order prohibiting further action against the duo.

In his seven-page letter to the Principal Secretary (Forest), the CWW pointed out that Mr. Shaji and Mr. Prasanth were “members of an organised mafia” that has been engaged in committing offences that span over decades. If the government order prohibiting action against them was not withdrawn, it would cause a serious setback to the law enforcement machinery besides helping the culprits evade the legal consequences of their action, he warned.

The State government stalled action against them after considering a submission from the Elephant Owners Association and called for a report on the complaint that officials were harassing the elephant owners.

Viral video

The Forest Department sprung into action after a video in which Mr. Shaji claiming to have brought over 200 elephants to Kerala from Assam, Bihar and the Andamans went viral. He was also seen recounting the elephant trade he had carried out over the years.

According to the letter, Mr. Shaji has been involved in inter-State illicit purchase and transit of elephants to Kerala and several other offences, including ivory trade. The CWW also pointed out seven wildlife crime cases booked against him in various forest ranges.

Illicit transactions

The letter noted that Mr. Prasanth indulged in illicit transactions of elephants from other States, forging various documents to facilitate the illegal trade, act of perjury and misleading the court by submitting false documents. The complaint of the association is devoid of merit.

“Even by the admission of elephant traders,” the CWW noted, “the offenders have been violating the provisions of law for long time and the arms of the law are just about to reach them.”

He also pointed out that the officers involved in the operations against elephant traders face tough challenges even beyond their official sphere of works. The CWW defends his action against the law-breakers as strictly in accordance with the law.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cww-seeks-govt-nod-to-act-against-elephant-traders/article32863098.ece
146,2020/10/15,Bio-capsules become popular among farmers,"Bio-fertilizer developed by IISR is sold at ₹100 a tablet

The use of bio-capsules, a bio-fertilizer technology developed by the Indian Institute of Spices Research (IISR), is picking up among farmers in place of traditional fertilizers. Scientists with the IISR here attest that the sale of this new product has been on the rise since the lockdown days which witnessed the entry of many young entrepreneurs into the organic-farming sector.

A report released by the IISR on Thursday confirms that the total number of bio-capsules sold to small-scale and large-scale farmers in May 2020 alone is 4,000. Between May and August, 6,000 tablets were sold to farmers in States like Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. There are also farmers from Telangana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and other north Indian States who have started using it.

Revolutionary technology

According to IISR scientists, the positive trend continues to be a matter of joy as the average monthly sale of this product which stood at just 400 before the lockdown period is changing with its popularity among the users. Santhosh J. Eapen, Director, IISR, says bio-capsule is a revolutionary technology which ensures the successful delivery of biologically competent and beneficial microbes.

The bio-capsule priced at ₹100 uses a select combination of beneficial microorganisms such as Trichoderma, Pseudomonas and Bacillus. Unlike the traditional microbial formulations, the novel encapsulation technology developed by a team of scientists led by former IISR Director M. Anandaraj gives it the advantage of easy storage, usage and transport. The production is now being controlled by two licensed private firms with different microorganisms based on the requirements.

One of the key attractions of this fertilizer is that a capsule can be diluted in 100-200 litres of water for the required quantity of application. Researchers say 4,000 capsules are equivalent to 4,000 kg talc-based formulation of microorganisms. As the weight of the capsule is only one gram, a farmer can easily replace 4 tonnes of formulation with 4 kg of capsules.

Cost-effective method

Both traditional farmers and trained youngsters have been found exploring this cost-effective method for months which does not create any harmful residuals. The majority are exploring its scope for improving their organic vegetable and spice cultivation. According to researchers, it also suits the requirement of urban farmers who are fond of organic farming in grow bags.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/s9xuxm/article32863065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvkzbiocap,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bio-capsules-become-popular-among-farmers/article32863010.ece
147,2020/10/15,Unqualified medical practitioners barred,"HC order quashes GO exempting registration for traditional medicine practitioners

The Kerala government can no longer permit people without qualification to practice traditional medicine or ‘paramparya vaidyam’, naturopathy or any other forms of alternative medicine.

This follows a Kerala High Court order on October 14, which quashed government orders exempting registration for unqualified practitioners. The order termed a certain provision that gave powers to the authorities to do so as ‘unconstitutional.’

Raju Thomas, president, and Sadath Dinakar, general secretary, Ayurveda Medical Association of India (AMAI), said in a release on Thursday that their organisation had legally challenged the government order issued in 2011 allowing unqualified people to practice traditional medicine.

The court pointed out that the orders issued by the State government “with respect to the exemption from registration by invoking the powers conferred under the 1st proviso to Section 38 of the Travancore-Cochin Medical Practitioners (TCMP) Act, 1953, is repugnant to the provisions of the Central Act of 1970” and was ‘unconstitutional.’

The Division Bench said that the order providing registration to unqualified practitioners of naturopathy and other alternative medicines were in conflict with the provisions of the Central Act, orders of the Government of India, and the guidelines specified. The court also struck down the first proviso to Section 38 of the TCMP Act, 1953.

The AMAI functionaries said that the High Court order was against the backdrop of a Supreme Court order in 2017 which said that people who are not qualified and not registered themselves with the respective medical councils should not be allowed to practice medicine.

Those who violate the law are liable to be punished by one year in jail or ₹5 lakh as fine, or both, they added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/unqualified-medical-practitioners-barred/article32862876.ece
148,2020/10/15,Revathy and Padmapriya seek response of AMMA leadership,"Comments by Edavela Babu against rape case survivor

Actors Revathy and Padmapriya have written to the leadership of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) seeking their stance on the comments made by Edavela Babu, the association’s general secretary, against the survivor in the sensational female actor rape case in a television interview.

The letter comes three days after actor Parvathy Thiruvothu resigned from the association in protest against what she termed as ‘utterly disgusting’ remarks against a woman member who had been badly let down by the organisation.

Besides asking the association leadership to divulge its position on Mr. Babu’s remarks, Ms. Revathy and Ms. Padmapriya have sought a reply on the endorsement of the general secretary’s remarks against the actor by K.B. Ganesh Kumar, MLA, and vice president of the association. “What will be the action taken when some members of the leadership behave in a fashion that discredits A.M.M.A and the film industry as a whole?” they asked.

Abuse of power

The actors referred to Mr. Babu’s comments as an example for some of the members in the association leadership using their position to disparage a criminal investigation that is sub judice. “An example that as the only organisation in the film industry with close to 50% women members there will be no measures taken to protect, support, and encourage them. Instead, it appears that all efforts will be made to alienate and ridicule them and their issues in public. An example that no matter how adverse a scenario A.M.M.A. faces collectively as an organisation, the entire leadership will stay quiet,” they said.

On the association general secretary’s response to the sexual harassment allegations against its executive committee member Siddique, Ms. Revathy and Ms. Padmapriya asked whether the association leadership has institutionalised the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act that prevents harassment and protects women at their workplaces.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/revathy-and-padmapriya-seek-response-of-amma-leadership/article32862554.ece

The Congress in Kerala on Thursday alleged that the Wayanad district administration had not granted permission for the online inauguration of a school here by Rahul Gandhi, MP, as prior permission was not sought.

Senior party leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi was to have virtually inaugurated the newly constructed plus-two (12th standard) block of the government vocational higher secondary school at nearby Mundery on Thursday morning.

However, since the permission was not granted, the programme was cancelled, Congress sources said.

The District Congress Committee president I.C. Balakrishnan told PTI that the move was politically motivated.

The building, constructed under the Multi-Sectoral Development Programme (MSDP), was constructed by Nirmithi Kendra at a cost of ₹ 1.2 crore.

According to Kalpetta MLA and CPI(M) leader C K Saseendran, the MSDP is a joint venture of the central and state governments with 60 and 40% stake, respectively and the programme should have been scheduled with the knowledge and approval of the state government.

“This programme has not been called off but has been asked to be rescheduled.My name was mentioned in the programme by the organisers.

The district collector has issued a stop memo for the programme since it has no prior approval as per the direction of the state governemnt,” Mr. Saseendran added.

151,2020/10/15,Kerala High Court restraints ED from arresting Sivasankar,"The Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the Enforcement Directorate(ED) not to arrest M Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Kerala Chief Minister till October 23 in a money laundering case registered by the ED in connection with the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case.

The court passed the interim directive when a petition filed by the senior IAS officer seeking anticipatory bail in the case came up for hearing.

During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General of India at the Supreme Court, S.V. Raju who appeared for the ED submitted that Mr. Sivasankar had not been implicated in the case till date. In fact, his apprehension of arrest by the ED was ill-founded. This was a serious case involving the smuggling of gold worth a huge amount and the involvement of influential people in the case could not be ruled out.

Counsel for Mr. Sivasankar submitted that ED had sent him a notice directing him to produce a passport size photo and a copy of the Aadhar card on October 14 in person or through an authorized person which he did. The ED had later issued him another notice saying that non-appearance before it would be treated as non-co-operation with the investigation. The agency had unnecessarily been harassing the petitioner. The petitioner was willing to cooperate with the investigation and would appear before the ED on Thursday. He did not have an intention to flee from the clutches of law.The counsel, therefore, pleaded for an order protecting him from the arrest.

The court also directed the ED to file a detailed affidavit in response to the anticipatory bail petition and posted the case on October 23 for further hearing.

In the bail petition, the IAS officer said that he feared that the investigating agency would arrest him. The ED had filed a charge sheet connection with the smuggling case before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act leveling baseless allegations against him. Though the petitioner was questioned for more than 90 hours by different agencies, no incriminating materials could be gathered by them to implicate him in the case.

The petitioner added that he was holding a key post in the government and he had occasion to contact the Consulate General in connection with his duties. He had struck an acquaintance with Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the smuggling case, while she was working as secretary to UAE Consulate General. In fact, the petitioner came to know about the involvement of Swapna and her friends in the gold smuggling case only after the consignment was seized by the customs, he claimed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-high-court-restraints-ed-from-arresting-sivasankar/article32860797.ece
152,2020/10/15,Malayalam poet Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri passes away,"He introduced “meaningful modernism” in the language’s poetry

‘Mahakavi’ Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, who brought last year’s covetous Jnanpith Award to Malayalam literature, died at a private hospital in Thrissur on Thursday morning. He was 94.

The last Malayalam poet to be called ‘Mahakavi’ (great poet), Akkitham was in hospital for the last two days after his health failed.

Also read: ‘Mahakavi’ Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri — He stands apart in stature, virtue

Born in 1926 at Kumaranallur in Palakkad district, Akkitham grew up to become the tallest poet in contemporary Malayalam literature, enjoying an indisputable position as the last Mahakavi of Kerala. He introduced “meaningful modernism” in Malayalam poetry several decades ago.

He worked for nearly three decades with Akashvani as scriptwriter and editor. Akkitham had close associations with Communist ideologue E.M.S. Namboodiripad when they both were part of the social reform movement.

He began dabbling in poetry very early in life by scribbling on temple walls. He made notable contributions to Malayalam literature through his poems, stories, plays and essays. He has nearly four dozen works to his credit.

Some of his seminar works include Pathalathinte Muzhakkam, Irupatham Noottandinte Ithihasam, and Balidarshanam. Among his widely read works were Bhagavatham, Nimisha Kshetram, Vennakkallinte Katha, Manassakshiyude Pookkal, Panchavarnakkili, Arangettam, Madhuvidhu, Oru Kula Munthiringa, Idinju Polinja Lokam, Amritagathika, Samathwathinte Akasham, Prathikara Devata and Manasapooja.

Akkitham was known for leading a life of great personal virtue. According to poet Manamboor Rajanbabu, he deserved to be called Mahakavi not only because of the greatness of his works, but also because of his virtuous life.

“He was a man of inimitable virtue who displayed great positivity and optimism. The modernism he heralded was quite meaningful. People could easily understand his poetry, which abounded in imageries that they could very well associate with. That’s his greatness,” said Mr. Rajanbabu.

Akkitham’s widely quoted lines “Velicham dukhamanunnee, thamassallo sughapradam” still have few parallels in modern Malayalam poetry not only in popularity but in depth as well.

The following lines of Akkitham have travelled deep down the minds of Malayalees:

""Theruvil kakka kothunnu,

Chathapenninte kannukal;

Mula chappi valikkunnu,

Naravarga navaathidhi.""

He was widely praised for his powerful imagery that ordinary people could easily associate themselves with.

His work Balidarshanam won the State and Central Sahitya Akademi Awards in 1972-73. He was the co-editor of Mangalodayam and Yogakshemam journals. He was awarded Padma Sri in 2017. Apart from the Ezhuthachan Award he won in 2008, he was bestowed with Odakkuzhal Award, Asan Award, Sanjayan Award, Lalithambika Antharjanam Award and several other honours.

Akkitham was honoured last month when the 55th edition of the country’s most prestigious Jnanpith Award was bestowed on him at a special function held at his house at Kumaranallur. He did Malayalam literature proud by becoming the sixth Keralite to receive the Jnanpith laurel. Although the award was announced in November 2019, the Covid-19 lockdown delayed the award ceremony till September this year.

People from different walks of life offered condolences. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that Akkitham’s compositions reflected his compassion for fellow humans.

A great loss for Indian literature: Kerala Governor

Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has said the passing of Mahakavi Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri is a great loss for Indian literature and Malayalam poetry.

""With roots firm on Indian thought, he played a role in bringing modern sensibility to Malayalam poetry"", the Governor said in a condolence message.

Funeral with State honours

The funeral of Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri will take place with State honour at his house at Kumaranellur near Thrithala in the district at 4 p.m. on Thursday.

Education Minister C. Ravindranath will lay a wreath on the poet’s body on behalf of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. District Collector D. Balamurali will lay a wreath on behalf of Minister for Culture A.K. Balan.

Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunilkumar will lay a wreath at Sahitya Akademi Hall at Thrissur.

153,2020/10/15,Lakkidi encounter: court dismisses plea for release of weapons,"The District and Sessions Court here dismissed the application of the police to release the weapons that were used in the encounter with Maoists at a private resort at Lakkidi in Wayanad district on March 6 last year.

C.P. Jaleel, 25, a suspected Maoist activist, was shot dead in the incident.

The Superintendent of Police (Operations), Kerala Anti-Terrorist Squad (KATS), had filed an application for release of the weapons, including eight AK-47 rifles, one TAR rifles, two INSAS rifles, and one GLOCK pistol, as the forensic examination of the weapons was over.

In his application, the officer had mentioned that the weapons would turn worthless if they were not maintained properly.

However, in a detailed objection filed before the court, C.P. Rasheed, Jaleel’s brother, said the police were yet to carry out a thorough investigation into the encounter or submit a report, though the court had sought it.

Hence, the release of the weapons without any merit could not be allowed. Since the police are also facing investigation, the weapons cannot be released, Mr. Rasheed said in his grievance.

Moreover, forensic and ballistic reports were not produced before the court. If the weapons are released now, evidence is likely to be destroyed, he added.

The court observed that since the investigation into the incident was still on, the contention raised by the respondent could not be entertained.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lakkidi-encounter-court-dismisses-plea-for-release-of-weapons/article32857796.ece

155,2020/10/15,Several fall in police net in Malappuram,"‘Operation Ranger’ simultaneously held in three districts

Two persons wanted in connection with alleged murder attempts, a man wanted in an abkari case, and several others involved in theft cases were arrested during raids on suspected hideouts in the district on Wednesday.

The raids, code-named ‘Operation Ranger’, were simultaneously held in Thrissur and Palakkad districts. District Police Chief U. Abdul Kareem said two men wanted in connection with alleged murder attempts were picked up from Perumpadappu and Tirur.

Three swords were recovered from the house of a man involved in crimes at Koottayi near Tirur. The man wanted in the Abkari case was picked up from Kadampuzha.

A double-barrel gun illegally kept by a man at Nilambur was also seized in the raids.

Mr. Kareem said a notorious burglar wanted in connection with 70-odd theft cases was also picked up during the raids. Rasheed Vellattuchola, nicknamed ‘Cutter Rasheed’, was arrested from Areekode. The police said he was behind five theft cases in recent months in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. He had stolen gold jewellery worth six sovereigns from a house at Therattammal in May. He gained the nickname Cutter Rasheed, as his modus operandi involved cutting jewellery from women while they slept, they added.

He had been released on bail a fortnight ago after his arrest at Kalpakanchery in connection with a theft case.

158,2020/10/15,Government doctors in Kerala to boycott additional duties,"KGMOA protest from today against State’s ‘lack of concern’

The Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA) has declared that government doctors will stay away from all additional duties from Thursday, in protest against the government’s apparent lack of concern about the plight of health-care workers who are overworked and fatigued, fighting on the front lines for the past nine months.

The KGMOA has, however, made it clear that while declaring non-cooperation, COVID-19 care and disease containment activities will not be disrupted.

In a statement issued here, the KGMOA said that apart from ignoring the KGMOA’s repeated demand for deploying additional human resources in COVID-19 care activities, the government’s decision to take away the leave given to health-care workers after continuous COVID-19 duty was something that defied all principles of fairness. This was totally unacceptable, the KGMOA said here.

‘Overburdened’

The statement said that medical officers in primary health centres were working round-the-clock. The brunt of the government’s decision not to deploy additional human resources was being borne by these doctors, many of whom had been contracting the disease.

The KGMOA has demanded that the government deploy additional human resource and that the leave after COVID-19 duty be restored immediately.

They also demanded that block-level call centres be set up by including doctors from the private sector to provide care to those in home care.

160,2020/10/15,Digital innovation is key,"Teachers must use technology to overcome existing obstacles in learning and teach in the local language

Education in the mother tongue or a local language is critical to establish a strong foundation for life-long learning for children in pre-primary and primary classes. A paper by UNESCO’s Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM Report) states that being taught in a language other than their own can negatively impact children’s learning, especially for those living in poverty. The new National Education Policy (NEP) also proposes that students be taught in their mother tongue or the local language till class V “wherever possible.”

Teaching in local languages however may be a deterrent in the short-run due to the lockdown-related disruption. The recent report by UNICEF claims that more than 1.5 million schools have been closed due to the pandemic, and approximately 286 million children from pre-primary to secondary levels have been impacted. Naturally, the online medium’s efficacy for education delivery in the mother tongue/local language has been called into question.

Unfortunately, the transition to online education has not been easy due to various reasons such as access to proper technological infrastructure, and also because teachers are not adequately equipped to handle new technology and digital tools. Moreover, overcoming the language barrier to teach children in their local language emerged as a bigger challenge due to lack of suitable content and innovative methodologies to leverage technology meaningfully.

Pandemic sparks innovations

The COVID-19 crisis has paved the way for many digital innovations to educate students. Several private organisations extended their expertise to rural government-aided institutions in the areas of teachers’ training, capability, and capacity building for education continuity and overcoming the rural-urban divide, and breaking language barriers.

A number of digital initiatives for education were launched or supported by governments, organisations, or corporates. One such by the Gujarat government, involving 1.2 lakh public school teachers, proved the ingenuity of teachers to learn and adapt to a new-age digital platform to build an online community, collaborate digitally, and share knowledge and innovative educational content in their local language. There were many instances where teachers started creating their video logs on various subjects, shared best practices through chats and video platforms for classroom delivery. One teachers even developed an application, which uses augmented reality to teach young students Gujarati alphabets.

Another unique initiative, “Padhai Tuhar Dwar”, was launched in the tribal areas of Chhattisgarh to connect students with their teachers through WhatsApp groups and educate them digitally. UNICEF initiated a “Radio Schooling” where programmes were aired to engage students and continue the learning process in various subjects.

In an era when online and digital delivery of education has become the new normal, schools and teachers will need to find innovative use of technology to break the language barrier and overcome the existing obstacles in learning. During the pandemic, we have witnessed that digital platforms and new technologies can bridge every perceivable gap in education delivery, and even break the language barrier.

161,2020/10/15,‘Putham Pudhu Kaalai’ movie review: A delightful look at life and relationships during lockdown,"Five Tamil filmmakers offer insights on love and hope with their varied storylines in this anthology that is more hit than miss

Lockdown and COVID-19 have hit the film industry hard, with multiple shootings being cancelled in the last few months and several releases stalled.

But there is always scope for new beginnings, be it in films or real life.

And that is the common theme in Putham Pudhu Kaalai, an anthology that packs in the works of five accomplished Kollywood filmmakers in one long stretch. Amazon Prime has had a few average outings with respect to Tamil cinema in the last few months. However, they now seem to be making all the right noises with ‘Putham Pudhu Kaalai’. How do the five short films fare?

Ilamai Idho Idho

Director: Sudha Kongara

Cast: Jayaram, Kalidas Jayaram, Urvashi, Kalyani Priyadarshan

There’s a huge Mani Ratnam and Alaipayuthe hangover to this, but the simple story thread and leads are charming. If Jayaram rolls back the years in his sequences with Urvashi, Kalidas and Kalyani’s endearing chemistry hits all the right notes. The domestic conflicts portrayed are all very relatably middle-class and Sudha’s writing of romance is classy. Ilamai Idho Idho is also an example of how to include small songs in OTT-aimed subjects. Composer GV Prakash is in fine musical form, filling in the gaps neatly. Also, watch out for SP Charan crooning a lilting number. SPB might have gone, but there’s still hope.

Avarum Naanum / Avalum Naanam

Director: Gautham Menon

Cast: MS Bhaskar, Ritu Varma

MS Bhaskar isn’t the quintessential stylish dad here, nor is this film anything like you’ve seen from GVM before. Known for his classy romantic touch in his subjects, Gautham does a complete U-turn here, while he sets out to explore — with emotional depth — the relationship between a grandfather and granddaughter in this short. MS Bhaskar is a scientist who has won scores of awards, but was he ever a dedicated family member? This moot question is answered while Ritu moves in with him during the lockdown. With some fun touches of how senior citizens have adapted to technology and a general commentary on the new WFH routine among IT employees , this short might be a little slow for an OTT watch, but is still quite stirring.

Coffee, Anyone?

Director: Suhasini Mani Ratnam

Cast: Suhasini Mani Ratnam, Anu Hasan, Shruti Haasan

Adamance is a recurring theme here. The character of Kathadi Ramamurthy (a familiar face from the Tamil stage), is stubborn regarding a medical decision. His wife was stubborn in the past, we learn, and so is their youngest daughter (Shruti Haasan), now based in Mumbai. We get a sense of what Soundara, the grand old lady of the house, might have been, but not much beyond that. This short explores familial conflicts, but the staging and performances are a tad too old-fashioned. It tries packing in too many subjects, leaving little time to explore them. This coffee could have been a little stronger.

Reunion

Director: Rajiv Menon

Cast: Andrea Jeremiah, Leela Samson, Sikkil Gurucharan

If the lockdown can create tension within people who are family, what about friends who we once knew? How much would they have changed as time passed by? Reunion, packed with some hard-hitting surprises, revolves around how Sadhana (Andrea) rediscovers herself. Popular Carnatic musician Sikkil Gurucharan passes muster as a doctor, while Leela Samson fits perfectly into the ambience of the tastefully-done house. There’s a smart callback to a popular song in an earlier film of the director, and the neat poetic touch in the climax is a good signal for new beginnings: one of the common themes present in all the films in the anthology.

Miracle

Director: Karthik Subbaraj

Cast: Bobby Simha, Muthu Kumar

Karthik Subbaraj might have done a Rajinikanth ‘mass’ film, but his ability to pack in lots of interesting details in a limited time period continues to make him one of the most exciting filmmakers in Tamil cinema. He proves this yet again in Miracle. Life for two small-time ruffians is hard due to the lockdown, but they have a master plan to turn that upside-down. Does that happen? Bobby and Muthu have a lot going for them in this tale that is set in a radically different universe when compared to the rest of the stories. Do watch out for the twist that Karthik Subbaraj is famously known for.

Amazon has greenlit a series adaptation of 1997 slasher horror feature “I Know What You Did Last Summer.”

The movie, featuring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe, was about four young friends who are stalked by a hook-wielding killer one year after covering up a car accident in which they killed a man.

The Amazon series, which hails from Sony Pictures Television, will be written and executive produced by Sara Goodman.

Shay Hatten, Original Film’s Neal Moritz and Pavun Shetty and Atomic Monster’s James Wan, Rob Hackett and Michael Clear will also serve as executive producers.

“We are thrilled to have I Know What You Did Last Summer with our incredible partners at Amazon Studios. Neal Moritz and Original Film’s development consistently fires on all cylinders and that is proven once again with Sara Goodman’s contemporary and pulsating character weaving suspense thriller,” Sony Pictures TV Studios co-president Jason Clodfelter said in a statement.

Albert Cheng, COO and co-head of television at Amazon Studios said, “The best horror franchises always have another scare coming, and this I Know What You Did Last Summer series from Sara Goodman is a perfectly twisted update to the iconic slasher movie. Any way you slice it, our global Prime Video customers will love this modern take on the fan favourite film.”

“I Know What You Did Last Summer”, directed by Jim Gillespie, had spawned two sequels: “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” (1998) and “I’ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer” (2006).",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3r6yuk/article32862006.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-series-in-works-at-amazon/article32862007.ece
163,2020/10/15,"Teenager Adithya Patel impresses netizens with his one-minute short film, 'Centrifugal'","Centrifugal maps a woman’s journey of life from birth to death

It took just one minute for 19-year-old Adithya Patel, a film student from Irinjalakuda in Kerala, to catch the attention of film buffs. Centrifugal, his début film, is making waves with its stark portrayal of a woman’s journey of life.

A lockdown project of Adithya’s, Centrifugal’s no-frills visualisation and lack of melodrama even while focussing on a serious subject has won the teenager appreciation from viewers.

“He was searching for a theme for his college assignment and that is when I came up with the idea of how a woman’s life is circumscribed by the men in her life. Right from the time she is born, a baby girl is bound by norms of patriarchy. She is constantly told to watch her step and fall in line with convention,” says Hena Chandran, Adithya’s mother who wrote the script.

Since the lockdown was in force, all shooting had to be done within the COVID-19 protocol in place. In a master-stroke, Adithya visualised his mother’s theme without any characters as such.

“This is a universal theme and so I felt faces were not irrelevant to the theme. Many elderly and middle-aged women in Kerala would have had the same experiences. So all through the film, I focus on the feet, on the paths not allowed to be taken by her feet,” explains Adithya, speaking on phone from Irinjalakuda.

The student of digital filmmaking of Jain Deemed University, Bengaluru, who is now attending online classes, cast family members, neighbours and shot the film at home. Sparse but evocative dialogues enhance each frame as it depicts the shackles placed on a woman. The film begins with the body of a woman and a frame showing her toes bound together for the last journey in her life. Right from the time she is able to walk, each step of her is watched, monitored and restricted by her family, father, husband and, even, her son. Every step she takes has to be with the concurrence of society.

“I concluded the film on a positive note with a young girl being freed from this suffocating supervision and monitoring. So the last frame is that of a young girl choosing her own path to explore,” says Adithya.

The down-to-earth Adithya says the film is just one step forward in his efforts to reach tinsel town and become a full-fledged filmmaker.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vpmf7h/article32861940.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmaditya21,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/teenager-adithya-patel-impresses-netizens-with-his-one-minute-short-film-centrifugal/article32861945.ece
164,2020/10/15,"‘Dexter’ reboot in the works, with Michael C Hall set to return","Showtime has handed the series a 10-part run that is set to go into production in early 2021 with a tentative premiere later next year

Serial killer drama “Dexter” is getting a revival as a new limited-series at Showtime, with Michael C Hall reprising the title character.

The popular series, which ran from 2006 to 2013 for eight seasons, revolved around Hall’s Dexter Morgan, who was a conflicted blood-spatter expert for the Miami Police Department but moonlighted as a serial killer.

According to Deadline, Clyde Phillips will also return as showrunner.

Showtime has handed the series a 10-part run that is set to go into production in early 2021 with a tentative premiere date later next year.

Gary Levine, co-president of Entertainment at the premium cable network, said the team was willing to revisit the character if they could find a creative take that was “worthy”, and they have “found it“.

Hall previously has said that it was a possibility that he would return to the character.

Phillips joined “Dexter” after the pilot had been filmed and became writer, executive producer and showrunner on seasons one to four. After his exit, he was credited as a consultant on the first few episodes of season five.

The final season saw Dexter faking his death and living under a new name after wrecking his boat and escaping from a hospital with the body of his sister Debra (played by Jennifer Carpenter), who had been shot and left in a coma, and having sent his son Harrison (Jadon Wells) and love interest Hannah (Yvonne Strahovski) to live in Argentina.

Season eight also starred David Zayas, James Remar, CS Lee, Desmond Harrington, Geoff Pierson, and Aimee Garcia.

“Dexter” is produced by Showtime and executive produced by Phillips, Hall, John Goldwyn, Sara Colleton, Bill Carraro and Scott Reynolds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/c1k3ai/article32861928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/image,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dexter-reboot-in-the-works-with-michael-c-hall-set-to-return/article32861929.ece
165,2020/10/15,"Revathy, Padmapriya question leadership of Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes","Their letter comes three days after actor Parvathy Thiruvothu resigned from the association in protest at Edavela Babu’s remarks in an interview

Actors Revathy and Padmapriya have written to the leadership of Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes seeking their stance on the comments made by Edavela Babu, the association’s general secretary, against the survivor in the sensational female actor rape case in a media interview.

The letter comes three days after actor Parvathy Thiruvothu resigned from the association in protest against what she termed as ‘utterly disgusting’ remarks against a woman member, who had been badly let down by the organisation.

Besides asking the association leadership to divulge its position on Mr. Babu’s remarks, Ms. Revathy and Ms. Padmapriya have also sought a reply on the endorsement of the general secretary’s remarks against the female actor by K. B. Ganesh Kumar, MLA, and vice president of the association. “What will be the action taken when some members of the leadership behave in a fashion that discredits A.M.M.A and the film industry as a whole?” they asked.

The actors referred to Mr. Babu’s comments as an example for some of the members in the association leadership using their position to disparage a criminal investigation that is sub judice.

“An example that as the only organisation in the film industry with close to 50 per cent women members there will be no measures taken to protect, support and encourage them. Instead it appears that all efforts will be made to alienate and ridicule them and their issues in public. An example that no matter how adverse a scenario A.M.M.A faces collectively as an organization the entire leadership will stay quiet,” they said.

On the association general secretary’s response to the sexual harassment allegations against its executive committee member Siddique, Ms. Revathy and Ms. Padmapriya asked whether the association leadership has institutionalised the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act that prevents harassment and protects women in their workplace.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ghzqfl/article32861784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/REVATHI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/revathy-padmapriya-question-leadership-of-association-of-malayalam-movie-artistes/article32861785.ece
166,2020/10/15,Ileana D’Cruz’s film ‘Unfair & Lovely’ to explore India’s obsession with fair skin,"Set in Haryana, the film chronicles the story of a dusky woman tamed by prejudices and biases held by the Indian society against dark skin.

Actors Randeep Hooda and Ileana D’Cruz have been roped in by Sony Pictures Films India for the upcoming comedy movie, “Unfair & Lovely” which delves into India’s fixation with fair skin as a standard of beauty.

The film is backed by Sony Pictures Films India in association with Movie Tunnel Productions.

Vivek Krishnani, managing director, Sony Pictures Films India, said they are driven to present unique stories that are entertaining, impactful and cognisant of the social climate.

“We have always strived to use our platform to deliver excellence, whether it is through introducing new talents, be it writers, actors and directors or exemplary stories that captivates the audience, completely,” Krishnani said in a statement on Thursday.

Laine Kline, head of Sony Pictures International Productions, said the film is a family comedy that explores an important subject which has been plaguing India for a long time.

Set in Haryana, the film chronicles the story of a dusky woman tamed by prejudices and biases held by the Indian society against dark skin.

The film marks directorial debut of Balwinder Singh Janjua, screenplay writer of “Saand Ki Aankh” and “Mubarakan“.

D’Cruz, who will be seen in the titular role of Lovely, said playing the character will be a unique experience.

“What I love about the film is that its narrative isn’t preachy; it’s a funny story that will leave viewers smiling and laughing. The team at Sony Pictures Films India and Balwinder Singh Janjua have made sure this subject is treated with a lot of sensitivity however keeping it as humorous as possible,” she said.

Known for dramas like “Highway” and “Sarbjit”, Hooda said he is excited to explore the comedy genre with this project.

“I think making people laugh is not easy. I got hooked on to this story from the first narration itself and can’t wait to get started on this one,” he added.

Talking about the plotline, Janjua said, “It is a rooted story based on our everyday life observations that reflect a reality of today’s world in a hilarious manner.”

Janjua has also written the script along with writers Rupinder Chahal and Anil Rodhan.

The film is slated for a 2021 release and will be shot in various locations across India.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3ngjvr/article32861673.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ileana,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ileana-dcruzs-film-unfair-lovely-to-explore-indias-obsession-with-fair-skin/article32861674.ece
167,2020/10/15,I felt blessed to get back to work: Rajisha Vijayan,"As her movie ‘Love’ reaches theatres, Rajisha Vijayan talks about working during the lockdown and her Tamil début opposite Dhanush

Rajisha Vijayan’s career in Malayalam films is marked by a string of meaty roles. She made a dream début with Anuraga Karikkin Vellam in 2016, which won her the Kerala State Film Award for the Best Actress. In 2019, she upped her game with three roles — the titular character in the coming-of-age drama, June, a cyclist in Finals and a survivor of sexual assault in Stand Up.

The pandemic-induced lockdown turned out to be a productive phase for the artiste; she has acted in two films, Khalid Rahman’s Love and Rahul Riji Nair’s Kho-Kho, during this period. Love is set to release in GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries on October 15. She is also working in her first Tamil film, Karnan, opposite Dhanush.

In a chat with MetroPlus, Rajisha says that it was like a blessing to get back to work. “When the lockdown started, it was fun initially since I could take a break and relax. But within a few weeks, I couldn’t wait to be on a film set. So when Rahman [Khalid Rahman] called up to discuss the project I was so thrilled that I didn’t even ask for the details. Love had more or less the same crew of Anuraga Karikkin Vellam. It felt great to collaborate with them again. Also, I was looking forward to act with Shine chettan (Shine Tom Chacko), a fabulous actor,” she says.

To the theatres Love released in the United Arab Emirates, besides Qatar and Saudi Arabia. “Before the pandemic struck, I had planned two projects with Khalid, Tovino Thomas-starrer Thallumala and another film with Kunchacko Boban. During the lockdown we all were frustrated being cooped at home. That’s when Khalid came up with this story and I was all for producing it. When restrictions on film shootings were relaxed, we decided to go ahead,” says Ashiq Usman, producer of Love. His latest production Anjaam Pathira was a box office success. He adds that the producers’ association was not happy when the project was announced since it was assumed to be an OTT release. “However, in the letter given to the association, I had stated that the film will be released in theatres, OTT platforms and channels. Although OTT has emerged as a game-changer, it can’t replace a theatre experience. Our film was ready and so I decided to take it to theatres. I still don’t know how many people will turn up with only 50% of seating capacity being allowed. But someone had to take this step,” he says.

In Love, she plays Deepthi, wife of Anoop, played by Shine. The narrative is centred around the problems in their life, which eventually lead to many complications. “The film is a thriller, a genre I haven’t explored before. As an actor, I want to do all kinds of films. That experience eventually helps an artiste to grow,” she explains.

Rajisha points out that she did not feel restricted working with the COVID-19 protocol in place. It was shot in an apartment complex in Kochi with six main characters and a minimal crew. “Everything was organic. Even if the pandemic was not there, the story would have been set indoors. But then there would have been more people on the location. While I commuted from my home to the set daily, others stayed in the apartment complex itself until the shoot got over. I have the same look and use the same costume throughout the movie. In fact, after a few days I was tired of seeing myself in the same dress!” she chuckles.

Sports drama

Meanwhile, she has completed the shoot for Kho-kho, a sports drama directed by State award-winner Rahul Riji Nair. She plays Mariya Francis, a kho-kho coach who builds an all girls’ team in a tribal school braving several odds. She observes that although it was shot during the lockdown in Kollam, the experience was completely different from the shooting for Love.

“Rahul is a friend and when I heard the story I asked him whether we can go ahead with the project knowing fully well that it won’t be easy to make a sports movie with the restrictions in place. But everything happened so fast that it went on the floors within a month and was wound up in over a month’s time. There were days when we wished there were more people on the sets. However, the crew pulled it off smartly. When you see the visuals, you would never imagine that it was shot during the pandemic,” she adds.

The film has real-life kho-kho players. “They’ve killed it with their performance. Kho-kho is an underestimated game in spite of being one of the oldest traditional sports in the country. Presence of mind and speed hold the key,” she says. It was among the movies selected at the Co-production Market of National Film Development Corporation Film Bazaar 2018.

Talking about Karnan, directed by Pariyerum Perumal-fame Mari Selvaraj, Rajisha says that it is a rustic tale set in a different era. “Being on the set of a Tamil film has been a new experience. I had to work on the look. And since I don’t know Tamil, I learnt it. My character speaks the Thirunelveli dialect,” she says.

As Love releases this Friday, the actor admits that she never expected it to reach cinemas while shooting. “It’s disappointing that I won’t be able to watch it. But I am happy that at least some viewers can. After all, OTTs can’t replace the magic of the theatre experience,” she signs off.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/j57fl6/article32861522.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmrajisha,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/in-conversation-with-actor-rajisha-vijayan/article32861524.ece
168,2020/10/15,‘Bad Boy Billionaires: India’ review: A restrained tale of unbridled debauchery,"The production on Netflix lacks an original voice, hopping from one news item to another, stitching together a half-hearted narrative entirely lacking in conviction or insight

“Friends, the chairperson of the world’s largest family, the honourable Saharashri (Sahara-Shri) has arrived,” declares an announcer as Subrata Roy walks into a stadium filled with Sahara employees.

The chants of “Long Live Saharashri!” echo around the venue as the owner of a self-styled multi-billion dollar business enterprise, Roy, is seen waving at his faithful like a cult figure mobilising his forces for some ulterior motive.

To the uninitiated viewer, this scene appears to be straight out of a Leni Riefenstahl propaganda movie. However, it is but a part of Netflix’s three-part documentary series titled Bad Boy Billionaires: India, which explores the shenanigans of India’s self-made business tycoons gone bad.

Apart from ‘Saharashri’ Roy, the viewers are provided with a look at the life and crimes of liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who tried his hand at establishing an Indian airline brand and the notorious celebrity diamantaire Nirav Modi who defrauded one of India’s largest public sector bank to the tune of millions.

After weeks of legal wrangling, Netflix was allowed to air episodes on the aforementioned personalities, but had to do without the profile on Ramalingam Raju of the infamous Satyam scam.

These big boys of grand financial deceit captured the imagination of regular Indians with their-hyper luxurious, freewheeling and overtly flamboyant lifestyle — and in doing so, created a cult status for themselves.

But despite the documentary’s earnest attempts at charting their rise and fall, Bad Boy Billionaires: India fails miserably to penetrate the dark underbelly of their world of criminal undertakings and mass deception. The whole production lacks an original voice, hopping from one news item to another, stitching together a half-hearted narrative entirely lacking in conviction or insightfulness.

The most glaring of all its faults is the lack of courage. It fails to go beyond the titular figures on which it places so much attention and makes a conscious decision on its part to ignore the institutions and their designed systems that served as a breeding ground for wilful financial defaulters.

In a nutshell, the simple, drab nature of the piece which tries to come across as an investigative piece, is in stark contrast to the glitzy lifestyle of excesses and debauchery of its subjects.

This can be primarily attributed to the fact that the film wholeheartedly falls back on the tried and tested formula of dedicating the first half of each episode towards building up each of the personalities and their exploits, before the ‘big bust’ and subsequently charting their downfall. This somewhat drains the documentary of the elements of thrill and novelty, characteristic of so many other Netflix productions.

Even the striking drone visuals coupled with clinical editing do little to rescue the piece, which comes across not only as wholly uninteresting, but decidedly inconsequential. Archival footage from various Indian news programmes, testimonies by individuals formerly employed by these rogue businessmen and old interviews of the “bad boys” try and fail to paint a holistic image of the real situation.

The documentary chooses to linger on the surface, giving precedence to raw emotions over hard facts, making the process of watching it rather painstaking. Despite the likes of Raghu Karnad and Paronjoy Guha Thakurta providing the viewers with insight on some of the obscene excesses of the “bad boys”, something remains amiss.

However, all is not in vain. It might be the first instance of such a film in the Indian realm to come into existence, but will not be the last, and can surely help in opening the floodgates to the expression of the growing frustration of India’s working class in the backdrop of a lethal pandemic and a growing financial tumult.

169,2020/10/15,‘Blackpink: Light Up the Sky’ review: Netflix film provides fascinating insight into the life of K-pop idols,"Directed by Caroline Suh, the documentary chronicles the meteoric rise of the South Korean girl group and its members Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé

Blackpink: Light Up the Sky, Netflix’s newest documentary film couldn’t have dropped at a better time. The South Korean K-pop girl group made history by debuting at No.2 on the Billboard Top 200 chart a few days ago for their latest release, The Album, earlier this week.

Directed by Caroline Suh, the documentary chronicles the meteoric rise of the girl group and its members — Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé — who were introduced as Blackpink in 2016.

We see their earliest trysts with music, as the girls take us through their individual beginnings as teenage K-pop idol trainees with YG Entertainment. For a viewer who is largely unaware of what the genre of music is or how Blackpink burst onto the scene, the context is effectively set.

What makes the film shine is how the focus doesn’t just remain on the big moments. There’s a lot of screen time dedicated to their explosive performance at Coachella 2019 where they made history as the first girl K-pop group to take the stage at the prestigious festival, but the film also highlights the gruelling road towards their success.

Director Suh uses footage of the girls taken during their recording sessions, backstage at their concerts and intimate, personal interviews which she combines with early home videos taken before they became household names. The girls themselves, sit in a theatre and view videos of their first auditions as an Idol trainee with YG entertainment — giggling at their fashion choices, the ‘dark music’ they used to sing and how their musical prowess has evolved.

Blackpink: Light Up the Sky also throws some rather fascinating light on how K-pop idols are auditioned, trained and readied to become music superstars. Training for 14 hours a day, a break only once every 13 days, abstaining from drinking, smoking or getting tattoos, learning several new dance and music forms: all this for years coupled with the uncertainty that they might never actually debut as an idol.

Striking a refreshing balance between their career highs and lows, the girls take a look at their journey with honesty and sincerity. “When things get faster, it becomes rather overwhelming at times,” says Rose. If being an idol trainee was tough, thriving as the reigning K-pop queens comes with its share of homesickness, self-doubt and anxiety.

The documentary is also successful in humanising the global stars while also managing to capture the warmth they share. “When everyone settles into their roles, a synergy is born,” says Jisoo, as she reflects on what makes them tick.

With both Blackpink and septet BTS (Bangtan Boys) dominating the global music charts at present, the spotlight is shining harder than ever on Korean pop music. Suh, in a recent interview, said that she hopes for the Blackpink members to be seen as more than just one-dimensional stars and idols. The film does just that — and is sure to leave you rooting for them — and also wanting to play their chartbusters like ‘Whistle’ and ‘DDU-DU DDU-DU’ on loop!

170,2020/10/15,Relook at the moral compass through ‘Addham’,"Meet Siva Ananth, Sarjun and Barath Neelakantan, the directors of the short stories in the Telugu web series

‘Morality is a changing goalpost’ is the idea that binds together three short stories written by Siva Ananth for the Telugu web series Addham (mirror), which will première on Aha on October 16. The three-episode series produced by Sujatha Narayanan and E S Devasena has a Chennai-based cast and crew that worked on the project during the lockdown. Meet the three directors of Addham.

Siva Ananth has been associated with director Mani Ratnam since Dil Se, primarily in the direction and production departments. He also directed the Telugu film Chukkallo Chandrudu (2006). “Until a decade or two ago, several Telugu films were being produced from Chennai and we had a large pool of actors and technicians who worked in both Telugu and Tamil. Though my primary work is with Tamil cinema, I’d like to also think of myself as a Telugu film technician since I’ve directed a Telugu film,” he says.

Since Aha was game to look beyond romance and crime capers, Siva wrote hard-hitting stories on morality as the thematic connection. “A theme like this helps us look inwards. There are grey areas; sometimes there’s no demarcation between what’s right and wrong. Each episode is of 20 minutes duration,” he explains.

Siva directs the story titled The Unwhisperable Secret starring Varalaxmi Sarathkumar and Kishore: “Varalaxmi enacts the part of a mature and intelligent woman with an inner turmoil. I’ve been working with Kishore for Mani Ratnam’s next, Ponniyin Selvan, and he was game when I narrated this story.”

After script readings on Zoom and meticulous planning, the team went to shoot in the first week of August. The filming was wrapped up within three days with a small crew. “We planned everything, down to the shot divisions and smallest details, so that we don’t waste time on set,” says Siva.

Sarjun has earned a steady following thanks to his Tamil short films (such as Lakshmi, Maa and Montage) and feature films Airaa and Echcharikkai. Taking up a Telugu short for the first time, he recalls reading the script several times and listening to the dialogues to get familiar with Telugu words. “We had someone on set to guide me and the actors,” he shares.

The story titled The Road That Never Ends stars Rohini and Jayaprakash along with Praveen, a teen actor. “It’s a sensitive story where it’s tough to judge what’s right and wrong. We filmed under constraints during the lockdown and my thoughts were all about wanting to translate the brilliant story I read into a good film,” says Sarjun.

After months of lockdown, the actors were eager to face the camera. However, getting permissions to shoot outdoors wasn’t easy. After several attempts, the team got the go-ahead to shoot in a locality 25kilometres from Chennai. “We shot from 4am to 11pm one day and for 12 hours the following day. Only when editor Sreekar Prasad went through the footage and said we had good material, I was relieved,” says the director.

Sarjun is also in talks to direct a Telugu film for Geetha Arts.

Barath Neelakantan

“When I read the story Crossroads written by Siva, I felt it almost had my voice. One of the main reasons I left my corporate career and became a filmmaker is to be able to put out my voice,” says Barath Neelakantan, who directed the Tamil film K-13.

“In the planning stages of Addham, we (the three directors) debated on plot points and what a character is likely to say in a certain situation. In the process, we became greater friends since we shared our personal stories,” he says.

Crossroads stars Prasanna, Abirami Venkatachalam and Pavithrah Marimuthu. “When we talk of Crossroads, most of us talk about career and rarely do we acknowledge it in the context of our personal lives. This story deals with personal life,” says Barath.

Taking up a story written by another writer for the first time, Siva was concerned that he should be able to do justice to the story. “Siva watched the film and was very happy with how it turned out,” he says.

Though it’s his first Telugu project, he says it wasn’t tedious since his wife, a Telugu, was part of one of the script readings. Barath also took the help of friends in Telugu cinema.

Opening up for the first time about his battle with cancer, actor Sanjay Dutt says he is optimistic he will “beat” the disease soon. In August, the 61-year-old actor had announced that he would be taking a break from his professional commitments to focus on medical treatment, amid reports that he was battling lung cancer.

In an Instagram video, posted on late Wednesday evening, Sanjay Dutt was seen getting a haircut at the salon of celebrity hairstylist Aalim Hakim.

The actor pointed to a scar designed by Hakim as part of the haircut and said, “This is a recent scar in my life, but I’ll beat it. I’ll be out of this cancer soon.”

Sanjay Dutt, along with producer-wife Maanayata Dutt, had flown to Dubai last month to be with their children, nine-year-old fraternal twins Shaahran and Iqra.

The actor, who recently featured in “Sadak 2”, will be next seen in “KGF: Chapter 2” and Ranbir Kapoor-starrer “Shamshera“.

Sanjay Dutt said he is growing his beard for the sequel of the 2018 action-drama “KGF” as he is scheduled to start shooting for the film next month. The period action film, starring Yash, marks the Bollywood star’s Kannada debut.

“I need the look for the film as we are starting in November. I am happy to be on the sets again. There’s ‘Shamshera’s dubbing lined up too, so that will be fun. It’s good to be back,” he added.

Towards the end of the video, when Hakim said he was happy that the actor appears in good spirits, Dutt replied he has started working out again, after an apparent weight loss due to the treatment.

“I’m getting my muscles back, they’re coming back slowly. I’ll get out of this,” he said.

Sanjay Dutt is the eldest child of late Bollywood stars Nargis and Sunil Dutt. He has two sisters: Priya Dutt and Namrata Dutt.

Veteran director Ridley Scott and Hollywood star Joaquin Phoenix are teaming up once again for a period feature, titled “Kitbag”, which will see the “Joker actor play French military leader and emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.

The film marks the second collaboration between Scott and Phoenix after the multiple Oscar-winning “Gladiator” (2000).

The news comes as Scott wrapped production on the historical drama-thriller film “The Last Duel” in Ireland for 20th Century Studios.

“Kitbag”, the film’s title, is derived from the saying “There is a general’s staff hidden in every soldier’s kitbag”. A kitbag is a long narrow bag which is used by soldiers to carry clothes and other personal possessions.

According to Deadline, the project is an original and personal look at Napoleon’s origins and his swift, ruthless climb to emperor, viewed through the prism of his addictive and often volatile relationship with his wife and one true love, Josephine.

The intention of the film is to capture Napoleon’s famous battles, relentless ambition and astounding strategic mind as an extraordinary military leader and war visionary.

David Scarpa, who penned Scott’s 2017 directorial “All the Money in the World”, is working on the script for “Kitbag“.

A quick list at the names of the filmmakers and cast is enough to whet the appetite of any Tamil movie-goer; but special mention needs to go to Sudha Kongara for pulling off a casting coup in her segment, Ilamai Idho Idho.

If bringing back one of the most cherished on-screen pairings in Jayaram and Urvashi wasn’t exciting enough, the former’s son Kalidas and Kalyani Priyadarshan also join the two veterans in what seems to be a breezy feature on two couples discovering/ re-discovering love in the time of lockdown.

While Kalidas has acted with Jayaram before (as a child artiste, even winning a National Award for Ente Veedu Appuvinteyum in 2003), the father-son duo hasn’t made an appearance after Kalidas became a leading actor with Meen Kuzhambum Mann Paanaiyum in 2016.

Kalidas was a child artiste, even winning a National Film Award in 2003

“We are just waiting for the right opportunity; something exciting to make us act together,” says Kalidas. Though both of them are a part of Ilamai... in the anthology, they won’t share screen space.

“I haven’t had any influence at all on his career decisions; right from when he wanted to act as a kid to his choices now as a hero. We don’t even discuss cinema at home,” says Jayaram, who looks dapper in the new, snazzy look that he’s been sporting since his turn in Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo earlier this year. “Fitness is an integral part of cinema today; everyone looks for it and expects it even now. So I too felt a makeover was important; I took off for 70 days, dedicated myself to a new routine and worked really hard to get in shape,” he grins.

Joining us together on a Zoom call ahead of the anthology’s release, the actors are as charming and warm as ever, giving us insights on Putham…, the digital space today, Mani Ratnam, and much more.

Excerpts from an interview:

How did this project take shape under Sudha Kongara?

Jayaram: We actually have to thank the director for casting us. My son Kalidas has worked with her earlier, and broached the idea of Ilamai... with me after she suggested it. I’m a huge fan of films like Irudhi Suttru, and was longing to collaborate with someone like her.

It’s also my digital debut in a space like this, which makes it all the more so exciting. But I was most interested in seeing how Sudha and her team would overcome the challenge of shooting this footage in just a couple of days. After the shoot, I can safely say that she’s not just a director, but also an assistant, costumer and make-up artist rolled in one! She did everything.

‘Ilamai Idho Idho’ features four stars, two of whom are veterans in the field — was there any concern about garnering suitable screen space?

Kalidas: I have to be honest; I went through an entire year where nobody called me for work and I felt quite chastened. That’s when Sudha ma’am got in touch and gave me an opportunity (an anthology for another OTT platform). Following that, this anthology for Amazon Prime came about too. The only thing running through my mind was that I shouldn’t spoil her name or make her regret choosing me.

Kalidas Jayaram and Kalyani Priyadarshan

So, I knew that she casts actors only if she genuinely wants to convey a story with them, and gives prominence to their roles. She doesn’t do movies for any other reason, except delivering her vision perfectly. I was perfectly confident that every scene I was a part of, would have weight and purpose.

From the trailer, we see that both of you enjoy a fantastic chemistry with your co-stars, Urvashi and Kalyani Priyadarshan. Could you tell us about them?

Kalidas: I’ve known Kalyani for a while, but this is the first time I’m acting with her. Our working styles are very similar; we like to be fully prepared and do our research before the shoot, so it was really easy.

Due to the lockdown restrictions, there couldn’t be more than three actors on set at all times. However, after finishing my portions, I used to be present there as an AD as I’m very comfortable with the team, to watch my dad and Urvashi take over. They have decades of experience together, and I could learn a lot merely by just looking at them perform,

Jayaram: Urvashi is the co-star I’ve worked with the most.. (smiles). We go back 32 years. 1988 was the first time, I believe, we first met on set.

(The Jayaram-Urvashi pairing is one of Malayalam and Tamil cinema’s most beloved, endearing to several generations of fans with their legendary comic timing and chemistry. Chakkikotha Chankaran (1989), Kadinjool Kalyanam (1991) and Panchathanthiram (2002) to mention a few of their memorable outings together).

Jayaram with Urvashi in ‘Ilamai Idho Idho’

After all this time, we still find new ways to make it interesting. During Ilamai… the director talked about a particular scene in the script and the way she’d planned it. Then she asked us to interpret it in our own style, and to show her.

I asked Sudha ma’am to give us half an hour, and Urvashi and I scooted off to a corner. We came up with the idea to do the entire scene in one take, with multiple back and forth dialogues, and witty repartee. After a quick improv rehearsal, we showed it to Sudha ma’am, who just went, ‘Fantastic! Let’s do it exactly this way.’

Why do you think Malayalam cinema has been so popular on OTT platforms during the pandemic? How has the space opened up work for aspirants?

Jayaram: Irrespective of the genre or length of the film, it’s all about the filmmaker trying to express his voice and intention to the viewers through his story. I think that’s where the success comes from. It’s also got to do with the simplicity of the script; we have seen so many young, brilliant directors and writers emerge in the last year whom I badly want to work with.

‘Ilamai Idho Idho’ is one of the five short films in ‘Putham Pudhu Kaalai’, an anthology filmed during the pandemic

Kalidas: In feature films, you can’t even imagine characters like the ones that are now being explored in the content on streaming platforms. It’s because the industry is built that way. I know the pandemic has been hard on everyone, including cinema, with theatres shut down and productions stalled… but the silver lining, if I may, is for some actors who have been lucky enough to get such opportunities.

Jayram sir, you have two massive projects in store next: Mani Ratnam’s ‘Ponniyin Selvan’ and the Sanskrit film ‘Namo’. What can you tell us about them?

Jayaram: Well, the world as we know it, has stopped temporarily. In Ponniyin Selvan, you will see 1000 to 2000 people on screen at once — that’s the magnitude of the canvas it’s being shot on — it will take a while to resume shooting again. We plan to get back to it by the end of 2020.

I play the role of Azhwarkadiyan Nambi in the movie; people who have read the novel must be familiar with the excellent character. Initially, I did have my doubts on being able to pull this off. After the first schedule, Karthi asked if Mani sir had given me any feedback about my performance. I heard that he had complimented Karthi, Jayam Ravi, and a lot of other people, but had said nothing to me! It immediately cast doubts in my mind. Did he not like my interpretation?

I texted Mani sir about this and got his reply: ‘You don’t need feedback from me to validate your acting prowess. It was beyond my wildest expectations!” (laughs)

As far as Namo is concerned, it is the sixth Sanskrit film made in India, and traces the wondrous relationship between Lord Sri Krishna and his dear friend Kuselan, and how they reunite at the end of Kuselan’s epic journey. I’m really looking forward to its release soon.

Jayaram in the upcoming Sanskrit film ‘Namo’

But right now, I’m most excited about seeing the other segments in the Putham… anthology as a member of the audience myself. We have got literally the cream of the crop — Gautham Menon, Karthik Subbaraj, Suhasini Maniratnam, Rajiv Menon and Sudha Kongara — an amazing combination of directors, actors and technicians on board. I couldn’t be more thrilled.

Ilamai Idho Idho is part of the Tamil anthology Putham Pudhu Kaalai, which will stream on Amazon Prime Video from October 16",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/8on6z5/article32859964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/collage-copy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/putham-pudhu-kaalai-jayaram-and-kalidas-on-acting-in-the-anthology/article32859975.ece
175,2020/10/15,‘Halal Love Story’ movie review: An ambiguous take on filmmaking within boundaries,"Despite some great performances, the script, that does not have an emotional core like in director Zakariya’s sparkling debut ‘Sudani from Nigeria’, meanders to a tame ending

Boundaries — as to what can be shown and what should not be — are not something artists like to encounter in their creative process. In Halal Love Story, streaming now on Amazon Prime, we have a filmmaking crew working within the confines set by a not-so-progressive Islamic organisation, which has hired them to make a telefilm.

The cultural wing of the organisation, which campaigns through street plays and seminars, decides that they need to make a tele-film to reach out to more people. They hire filmmaker Siraj (Joju George) to shoot the film, but he has to stay within the boundaries set by Taufeeq (Sharaf U Dheen)’s ‘Halal’ script, written considering the delicate sensibilities of the intended audience and the strictures of the religious laws.

Shareef (Indrajith), a deeply religious man who has dreams of being an actor, gets cast as the male lead, with his wife Suhara (Grace Antony) being forced to act as his wife in the film too, so that the halal laws are not broken. Director Zakariya and Muhsin Parari, who have co-written the film, uses this peculiar situation to draw out some humour.

Halal Love Story Director: Zakariya Mohammed

Starring: Indrajith Sukumaran, Grace Antony, Joju George, Sharaf U Dheen

Storyline: A small-time filmmaking crew working within the confines set by a not-so-progressive Islamic organisation, tries to make a telefilm

It takes its time to get into its groove, especially in the initial parts where the show of religiosity is overdone, even considering the fact that a religious organisation is at the centre. The real-life issues of the actors and the director merging seamlessly into the film’s content makes for some of the film’s most interesting passages. Not to forget how reluctant-actor Suhara, with acting lessons from Stanislavsky, makes her actor husband envious, even as he hams up his scenes.

The smatterings of humour and the performances of Grace Antony and Joju George holds the film together to an extent. Yet, the script, that does not have an emotional core like in Zakariya’s sparkling debut ‘Sudani from Nigeria’, slackens later and meanders to a tame ending.

Although the film’s writers try to convey an impression that they are lampooning some of the regressive aspects of this religious organisation, there is a level of ambiguity on where they stand. When Taufeeq, the writer of the film within the film, passionately argues with the director that they also want to make films which can cater to the narrow sensibilities of the members of their organisation, one gets the sense of the film casting a very sympathetic, supportive light on him.

At a time when newer boundaries, previously non-existent, appear out of nowhere to hem in artists and even advertisement filmmakers, this rather positive, lighter take on ‘conservative’ filmmaking is somewhat problematic, despite some of the effective humour.

176,2020/10/15,112th Nilgiri Mountain Railway day celebrated,"The event marks the anniversary of train service running between Mettupalayam and Udhagamandalam.

A special train attached to a heritage steam engine ran between Coonoor and Udhagamandalam on Thursday to commemorate the 112th Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) Day, as a special arrangement.

The event marked the anniversary of train service running between Mettupalayam and Udhagamandalam.

Founder of the Heritage Steam Chariot Trust, K. Natrajan, who organised the event along with the Salem division of the Southern Railway, said that the service was initially started between Mettupalayam and Coonoor and was later extended till Udhagamandalam.

“Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we could not have a very big event to mark the occasion, so the railways agreed to run an empty train hauled by a steam engine to Udhagamandalam from Coonoor,” said Mr. Natrajan.

Nilgiris District Collector J. Innocent Divya, who attended the event, said that the Nilgiri Mountain Railway was a source of great pride for the district. “The NMR, which is UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a source of great pride for the Nilgiris, and to commemorate the 112th NMR day, a special train was arranged to ply between Coonoor and Udhagamandalam,” said the Collector.

Ms. Divya added that the district administration had given its consent for partial resumption of services along the NMR. However, the decision to restart services was pending with the railways, she said.

“The sight of the steam engine plying again along the NMR line since services were suspended in March of this year will surely bring delight to local residents, and remind everyone of the train service’s importance to the culture and history of the Nilgiris,” said Mr. Natrajan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ja1hch/article32862482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/neel,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/112th-nilgiri-mountain-railway-day-celebrated/article32862483.ece

Industrial Tribunal, Tamil Nadu has closed the dispute between pharma giant Pfizer Healthcare India Private Limited and a section of its workers, after the parties reached a settlement agreement. The dispute relates to closure of the company’s manufacturing plant in Irungattukottai and cessation of 270 workers.

In early 2019, Pfizer had decided to shut down two of its Indian manufacturing plants — Irungattukottai (Chennai) and Aurangabad (Maharashtra) — owing to lack of commercial viability. The manufacturing plants had come under Pfizer's fold, after its acquisition of Hospira, a provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies in 2015.

Podhu Thozhilalar Sangam had raised a dispute before the Deputy Commissioner of Labour Sriperumbudur with regard to cessation of employment of 270 workmen. The negotiations talks failed and the dispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal, Tamil Nadu, according to court documents.

After the submission of the failure report, both the parties said they have entered into a settlement with regard to the said dispute and the claims of the members of the Petitioner Union have also been settled, Industrial Tribunal noted.

As per the settlement reached on February 6, 2020, Pfizer paid members of the union about ₹4.67 crore.

On the last day of World Postal Week celebrations, the Postal staff from Vellore honoured 78-year-old N.Senthamizh Kko, who has been maintaining a individual post box for the longest time.

The World Postal Week is celebrated from October 9 to 15. As part of celebrations the postal staff from Vellore honoured the oldest Savings Account holder, distributed chocolates to customers, distributed postal key chains to the public and other activities were organised throughout the week.

An individual or company can maintain an individual post box in the post office. “One set of keys will be with the customer and another with us. The letters for he/she will be kept in the post box and the customer can collect it whenever they want. There are 12 such individual post boxes in Vellore,” said Komal Kumar, Superintendent of Post Offices, Vellore region.

Mr. Senthamizh Kko has been maintaining the post box for the past 40 years. “He started it in the Vellore Head Post office when he started work as a clerk in Government School, Cholavaram, Vellore.

181,2020/10/15,RPF arrests booking agent in Vellore,"RPF IG Birendra Kumar formed a special team under ACP Prith Krishnan

The Railway Protection Force (RPF) raided a travel firm in Vellore for reportedly using software for pre-filling passenger information, bypassing captcha and booking tickets quickly even as regular passengers struggle.

According to RPF sources, following information about such illegal ticket booking happening in Vellore, Birendra Kumar, IG. RPF, Southern Railway and Senthil Kumaresan, Senior Divisional Commissioner, RPF, Chennai formed a special team under Prith Krishnan, assistant commissioner, RPF.

Information about the business activities of travel agents were collected and suspicion arose on Harisankar from West Bengal who runs Ramakrishna tours and travels in Vellore. A search was conducted by Muthupandi, Inspector/Avadi and Nagaraj Sub-Inspector, Katpadi and seized e-tickets, valued over ₹1.75 lakh, computer and other related accessories.

It was found that illegal software called ANMS and Real Mango were used for booking more tickets against the IRCTC rules and regulation. “They fed in details of passengers in the software and upon clicking book tickets, the software bypasses captcha and books tickets in a matter of seconds. At the same time passengers will be struggling to book one ticket. He has also formed multiple customer ids,” said a senior RPF officer.

He also installed apps of Tatkal on his mobile and used to book e-Tickets. Hari Shankar was arrested and police are searching for another suspect Taps Kumar Dhattu.

Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam on Thursday questioned the propriety of Anna University Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa for dashing off a letter directly to the Centre explaining the capacity of the institution to raise funds on its own.

Talking to reporters here, Mr. Shanmugam said that the act of the VC lacked discipline and he could not override the other authorities above him especially the Pro-Chancellor, Chancellor and the Tamil Nadu government. “Mr. Surappa cannot contact the Centre bypassing the State authorities and we have sought an explanation from him for writing a letter,” the Minister said.

Mr. Shanmugam said that the government had made it clear in the Assembly that a committee comprising of Ministers had been constituted to study the bifurcation of Anna University into Institute of Eminence (IOE). The committee is yet to submit its report.

The Minister said that the government would never accept any step that would disrupt the 69 % reservation introduced by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.

He said that certain provisions in the letter of the Union Human Resource Development related to award of IOE status were not acceptable and basically hitting at the 69% reservation policy followed in the State.

Actor Rajinikanth has paid the property tax of ₹6.50 lakh for his Raghavendra Mandapam (marriage hall) located in Viswanathapuram Main Road, Kodambakkam, on Thursday.

In a press release on Thursday, the Greater Chennai Corporation confirmed the payment of the property tax by the actor totalling an amount ₹6,56,000 (which includes the late pay penalty).

The actor had filed a writ petition against the property tax notice issued by Chennai Corporation in the Madras High Court. The writ petition was dismissed on Wednesday based on a withdrawal petition filed by the actor's counsel. The Judge had told Mr. Rajinikanth's counsel (and other litigants repeatedly) to not waste judicial time by filing cases immediately after sending representations to officials concerned.

Accepts mistake

Over the last two days, Mr. Rajinikanth, one of the highly paid actors in the country, faced criticism on social media for going to the court for property tax relief of ₹6.5 lakh during the pandemic when millions of Indians have lost their jobs and their livelihoods.

In response, Mr. Rajinikanth wrote on social media that he could have avoided the mistake of going to Court. “We should have appealed to the Corporation. We could have avoided this mistake,” he said with an hashtag stating ‘Lesson from experience’.

‘System Seri Illai’

Meanwhile, Congress Lok Sabha MP from Karur, S. Jothimani, on Thursday seemingly took a potshot at actor Rajinikanth after he was warned by Madras High Court for wasting the court’s time by filing a case for property tax relief of ₹6.5 lakh.

Ms. Jothimani invoked Mr. Rajinikanth’s now famous line ‘System seri illai’ (the system is not right) to make a point about how he went to court for tax relief and was warned by the court. “Crorepathis are being made to pay taxes for the properties they own. If they go to the courts against the tax, they are being warned. System is not right,” she posted, without directly mentioning him.

184,2020/10/15,"TNERC issues draft norms to ensure public safety against electric shock, fire hazards","The draft also makes it mandatory to obtain the safety approval from the Electrical Inspector for multi storeyed buildings of more than 15 meters height

Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) has issued a draft regulation to ensure that the safety norms and regulations mandated in the Central Electricity Authority regulations such as provision of residual current device inside the premises of consumers are included while availing service connection.

The move is aimed at creating awareness among consumers and for effective implementation to ensure public safety against electric shock and fire hazards, it said in an explanatory note.

The draft also makes it mandatory to obtain the safety approval from the Electrical Inspector for multi storeyed buildings of more than 15 meters’ height as per Central Electricity Authority (Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply) Regulations 2010.

“The draft has specifically included IT-related industries among the consumers who have to provide space for establishment of substation/switching station where load exceeds 5 MVA or total floor area of 30,000 square meters and above,” P Muthusamy, former director (engineering), TNERC said. In the existing provision, all industries have been excluded in providing space which led to an ambiguity whether IT related services are included in industries or not, he noted.

The draft Regulation has also reduced the load limit from 150kW to 112kW for providing space for erection of Transformer etc. by the consumers requiring LT supply. This is in line with its latest amendment enacted, wherein the TNERC has increased the demand limit to 150kW from 112kW for availing LT supply but imposing a fixed charge equivalent to the demand charges of HT consumers for the LT consumers who avail the demand above 112kW.

Mr. Muthusamy also pointed out in a separate draft regulation TNERC has introduced a new category of consumer for payment of power factor compensation, based on Voltage. For the consumers with HT supply of 33KV and above, the power factor (the ratio of true power used in a circuit to the apparent power delivered to the circuit) shall not be below 0.95, failing which they shall be liable to pay compensation by way of disincentive at such rates as the Commission may declare from time to time. Previously the power factor (PF) limit was only 0.90 which was common to all the HT consumers including 33kV and above consumers.

However, Mr. Muthusamy pointed out such a separate power factor compensation for 33kV and above consumers can only be specified during the next tariff revision of TNERC, as its previous 2017 tariff order did not specify any compensation for 0.95 to 0.90 PF range.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tnerc-issues-draft-norms-to-ensure-public-safety-against-electric-shock-fire-hazards/article32860120.ece
185,2020/10/15,Vijay Sethupathi will be known as a betrayer if he acts in Muralitharan biopic: Ramadoss,"'He will be part of Tamil Eelam history if he drops the film'

PMK founder S Ramadoss on Thursday said that if actor Vijay Sethupathi announces that he will not act in Sri Lankan cricketer Muthiah Muralitharan's biopic titled 800, he will part of Tamil Eelam history or else he would be known as a betrayer.

In a statement, he said even though explanations has been given that Vijay Sethupathi is acting in the film on Muthiah Muralitharan’s sporting achievements, the suspicion is that it would depict Rajapaksa brothers in a positive light.

“I respect the creative freedom of Vijay Sethupathi. But, that freedom should not be used to shame the motherland. I am not going to urge him to drop his plan of acting in the film,” Mr. Ramadoss said.

Seeman condemns

Naam Tamilar Katchi chief coordinator Seeman on Thursday urged actor Vijay Sethupathi to back out from acting in Sri Lankan cricketer Muthtiah Muralitharan's biopic titled 800, ""respecting the sentiments of Tamils across the globe.""

In a statement, he alleged Muralitharan acted against the interest of ethnic Tamils in Sri Lanka and is a proxy to the country's ruling Rajapaksa family.

“Filming a biopic on Muralitharan would be against the spirit of struggle for freedom of Eelam. Acting in the film is not good for Sethupathi’s acting career and it would affect his future prospects,” Mr Seeman felt. If Sethupathi thinks the film can be released on OTT platforms, instead of theatres, it would affect the release of his other films, he warned.

Mr Seeman claimed that the biopic cannot be thought of as just a film and he is opposing tthe film because of the “political dangers” involved behind it. “It can’t be said Sethupathi was not aware about the sentiments and statements made by Muralitharan. Going ahead with the project is condemnable,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/awhviw/article32860085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIJAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vijay-sethupathi-must-drop-plan-to-act-in-muralitharan-biopic-ramadoss/article32860087.ece

Former Minister and DMK MLA Poongothai Aladi Aruna on Wednesday described as “shocking and baseless” reports on social media that she was joining the BJP.

“I would not join the fascist BJP even at gunpoint,” she told The Hindu when asked about the reports.

188,2020/10/15,"800 will not hurt the sentiments of Eelam Tamils, say producers","‘The film will not delve into politics or favour any community’

After actor Vijay Sethupathi was subjected to strong criticism on social media for agreeing to star in a movie titled 800, a biopic on Sri Lankan cricketer Mutthiah Muralitharan, the film’s producer, Dar Motion Pictures, said the film is “purely a sports biography”.

The first look of the film was released a couple of days ago. In a statement, the production house said the film did not make any political statement favouring any community.

“This film is intended to be an inspiration for the younger generation to achieve their dreams irrespective of the difficulties they come across in their journey. We, as the producers, assure that this film will not showcase any scenes that will belittle the struggles of Eelam Tamils in Sri Lanka or hurt their sentiments in any way,” the statement said.

“On a positive note, the film will engage the Tamil film community in Sri Lanka, providing the artists and technicians a platform to showcase their talents on a global stage. Art is beyond boundaries; it unites people all across. Artists belong to the world,” it said.

Sympathisers of the ethnic Tamil struggle took to social media, tagging Mr. Sethupathi, urging him not to star as the cricketer “known to be a supporter of Mahinda Rajapaksa”, accused of presiding over a war in which thousands of Tamil civilians were killed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/800-will-not-hurt-the-sentiments-of-eelam-tamils-say-producers/article32857455.ece
189,2020/10/15,T.M. Krishna sets to tune Emperor Ashoka’s edicts,"The project was launched on the day B.R. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism

Renowned Carnatic musician T.M. Krishna had his hands full these past few months digging into the works of Emperor Ashoka.

Wednesday saw the online premier of the first part of his Edict Project, in association with Ashoka University, where he set to tune four edicts of Emperor Ashoka to the ragas — Kapi, Shubhapanthuvarali, Mohanam and Desh.

“All my people are my children. I yearn for their welfare, why,” goes the meaning of the first song that begins Munise Paja, which Mr. Krishna sings to the accompaniment of just his tambura.

“The songs were recorded during the lockdown so there were no instruments, just my tambura. Through the Edict Project, I hope to re-imagine the emperor’s edicts in a musical format. To my knowledge, this is the first time they are being sung. I have rendered four edicts in a raga-tala-malika composition,” he said.

“The underlying message in all of Ashoka’s edicts is love and compassion. Ashoka himself symbolises the possibility of transformation. A person who believed in expanding, consolidating and ruling his empire through violence and war changed into one who made an ethical order the governing principle of his empire and personal life. Our world today is filled with hate, anger, bigotry and polarisation. In this context, the words of Ashoka are precious. We need to rediscover and re-imagine them, and let them inspire us to look within as individuals and communities. Ashoka’s words are connected to the inner spirit of our Constitution and how we need to envision governance,” he said.

The project was launched on the day B.R. Ambedkar, the father of the Indian Constitution, embraced Buddhism.

The introductory text to the video, which is available on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, is by former West Bengal Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi.

Thiruvengadam Award 2020 instituted by Rotary Club of Madras East and Kauvery Hospital. After receiving the award, he said, “We see the same spirit of Dr. K.V. Thiruvengadam through numerous doctors and healthcare workers who have been quietly and relentlessly working during this crisis. In the challenging times we have been living in, it is humbling to receive the award.”

He noted that Tamil Nadu was perhaps one of the first States that scaled up testing massively and starting with 10 beds, the State now has 1.42 lakh beds for COVID-19. “Isolation, testing and treating is the way to handle this pandemic. And the real heroes helping us do this are the nameless doctors and healthcare professionals across the State,” he said.

Devi Shetty, chairman and executive director of Narayana Health, said, it is rare to find a humble government officer like Mr. Radhakrishnan. “One of the main reasons I admire him is because of his ability to increase the number of seats in medical colleges for under graduation and post graduation courses during his tenure as health secretary,” he added.

194,2020/10/15,"Now, local bodies can clear building plans for up to 10,000 sq ft built-up area","Order applies to residential buildings; existing delegation of powers to local bodies for commercial buildings will continue

In a significant development, the Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday expanded the powers already delegated to local bodies (except Chennai), allowing them to grant planning permission for residential buildings with built-up area of up to 10,000 sq ft. Earlier, the limit was 7,000 sq ft.

The local bodies, barring Chennai, can clear building plans for up to eight dwelling units, not exceeding 12 m in height, up to stilt + 3 floors or ground + 2 floors.

However, the existing delegation of powers to local bodies in case of commercial buildings will continue, according to a G.O. issued on October 13 and made available to The Hindu.

The G.O. asked the Director of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) and the Member Secretary, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, to implement the new rule. The Housing Department’s decision follows the proposal of the DTCP to grant more powers to local bodies. The DTCP had stated that the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), Tamil Nadu, had, in a representation, sought more powers for local bodies “to simplify the process of granting planning permission for small buildings”. The DTCP said the existing process for commercial buildings could be continued.

On February 4, 2019, the State government framed the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019, which has been implemented since.

As per the rules, local bodies (except Chennai) can grant building permission for residential buildings if their total built-up area is up to 7,000 sq ft, with up to eight dwelling units not exceeding 12 m in height and up to stilt + 3 floors or ground + 2 floors. Building plans for commercial use can be approved for a built-up area of up to 300 sq m, not exceeding 12 m in height for other local bodies within the Chennai Metropolitan Area, and for 2,000 sq ft and up to stilt + 2 floors or ground + 1 floor for others.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lj08zh/article32857591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THHOUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/now-local-bodies-can-clear-building-plans-for-up-to-10000-sq-ft-built-up-area/article32857592.ece
195,2020/10/15,Conservationists welcome SC verdict,"‘SC and HC playing important role’

Conservationists have welcomed the Supreme Court’s verdict on the notification of the Sigur elephant corridor in the Nilgiris.

Mudumalai Tiger Reserve Field Director K.K. Kaushal appreciated the “stellar role being played by the Indian judiciary in conserving the forests and the environment of the country. Both the Supreme Court and the [Madras] High Court are playing an important role in wildlife conservation”.

“It is imperative that the landscape is protected as the corridor is important for elephants moving between different regions of the Sigur plateau. It also allows elephants to move between the three States of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu,” said Arunsankar from the Tamil Nadu Green Movement.

“Though I am yet to read the full order of the Supreme Court, the judgment will definitely help protect the fragile elephant habitats in the Nilgiris, particularly in the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve,” said a conservationist from the Nilgiris who requested anonymity.

Tribal rights’ activists, while largely in praise of the verdict, voiced concerns over implications the order might have for communities living on the corridor. M. Senthil Kumar, general secretary of the Mudumalai Pazhangudiyinar Nala Sangam, said he had not had the opportunity to go through the entire order, but hoped the verdict would not lead to the displacement of Adivasi communities in the region.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/conservationists-welcome-sc-verdict/article32857584.ece
196,2020/10/15,Kushboo apologises for remarks,"Disability rights bodies had filed complaints against her

Following criticism from disability rights organisations regarding her remark that the Congress had no “mental development”, actor and BJP functionary Kushboo Sundar on Wednesday evening apologised for the comment. Earlier in the day, disability rights groups had filed online police complaints against her.

“We have lodged an online complaint against her and we have requested that an FIR be registered against her under Section 92 (a) of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, as also under other provisions of the IPC,” said S. Namburajan, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Association for the Rights of all types of Differently-abled and Caregivers.

Following this, in a statement, the actor-politician apologised for the “incorrect” use of a few phrases, which she said were used “in a moment of hastiness, deep distress and anguish”.

According to her, she was not just sensitive to the diversity among people, but also valued it and gained hugely from it. “I realise that leaders in the past have also made similar references, and as much as I am disappointed by the inadvertent distress that I have caused many, I am now equally determined to ensure that I do not repeat this, ever, whatever the motivation maybe. I also dedicate myself to ensure that the voices of those with psychosocial disabilities are valued and heard, as they should be,” she added.

The National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled (NPRD) and the December 3 movement too said that the terms she used were insensitive.

“While Kusbhoo Sundar has every right to politically take on her opponents, usage of terms that invoke a negative portrayal of disability is unacceptable. Time and again, people holding public offices have invoked such negative terms to tarnish the image of political opponents, lending them legitimacy,” said Muralidharan, general secretary, NPRD.

The NPRD further said that action against high-profile people who make such statements should act as a deterrent, sending the message across that insult and humiliation of the disabled, as well as their negative portrayal, will not be tolerated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tzqcsy/article32857552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THKUSHBOO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kushboo-apologises-for-remarks/article32857553.ece
197,2020/10/15,"Is there any possibility of reopening schools by year-end, asks HC","The Madras High Court on Wednesday wanted to know from the State government whether there was even a remote possibility of reopening schools, at least by the end of the year.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh directed Special Government Pleader (Education) C. Munusamy to obtain instructions on the query raised by him from the School Education Department, and report to the court by November 11.

The judge said he might consider permitting private schools to collect some more fees from parents, apart from the 40% he permitted to be collected through an order passed on July 17, if the institutions are not allowed to reopen this year.

‘Not all parents paid’

He said this after senior counsel Father Xavier Arulraj and advocates Hema Muralikrishnan and E. Vijay Anand, representing various private schools, reported to the court that nearly 50% of parents had not remitted even the 40% of fees that the court had permitted to be collected.

The lawyers said the schools were struggling to maintain the institutions and pay salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff due to a paucity of funds since several parents had not paid even the court-fixed fees, despite their children continuing to attend online classes.

Since the July 17 order stated that schools could collect another 35% of the fees only after they reopen, counsel urged the court to modify the order and permit them to collect more fee since finances were dwindling and there was no sign of reopening.

After deciding to take a call on their grievances next month, the judge directed School Education Department officials to conduct an inquiry against 33 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools accused of collecting more than 40% fees.

Advocate G. Nagarajan, representing the CBSE, said the regional officer had received complaints against the 33 schools. All complaints had been forwarded to the jurisdictional chief educational officers (CEOs)and district educational officers (DEOs) for appropriate action.

Probe ordered

The judge directed the CEOs and DEOs to conduct an inquiry into the complaints by hearing all parties concerned and file a report in the court so that suo motu contempt of court proceedings could be initiated against the erring institutions.

As far as the contempt proceedings which the judge had initiated against eight schools were concerned, four entered appearance on Wednesday through counsel and sought time to file detailed affidavits explaining their stand.

Justice Venkatesh accepted their plea and adjourned the hearing on the contempt petition as well to November 11. He directed the registry to issue fresh notices to four other institutions that had not entered appearance so that they could also be heard next month.

When parents of children studying in two Chennai schools — one located in Anna Nagar and the other in Chetpet — complained that the schools had also demanded more than 40% fees, the judge directed the School Education Department to hold inquiries and submit a report.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/krmouv/article32857506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THHC2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/is-there-any-possibility-of-reopening-schools-by-year-end-asks-hc/article32857507.ece
198,2020/10/15,"Centre allows Tamil Nadu to borrow an additional ₹9,627 crore","Move follows State’s acceptance of GST compensation plan

The Finance Ministry on Wednesday granted Tamil Nadu permission to raise an additional ₹9,627 crore through open market borrowings after the State formally communicated to the Centre its acceptance of the latter’s proposal that the States borrow from the market to meet the shortfall in GST compensation cess collections this year.

“With today’s permission, 21 States have been granted permission to mobilise ₹78,542 crore so far,” the Finance Ministry said, stressing that the permission granted “is over and above” the approvals needed to enable the States to raise ₹1.1 lakh crore and meet the revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.

The Centre’s nod to Tamil Nadu comes two days after extended negotiations in the GST Council on the borrowing proposals failed to deliver a consensus, with several Opposition-ruled States demanding that the Centre borrow to bridge the shortfall in the GST cess to compensate the States.

On Tuesday, the Expenditure Department in the Finance Ministry allowed 20 States to raise ₹68,825 crore from the market.

These States had picked the first of the two options offered by the Centre — letting the States to borrow ₹1.1 lakh crore of the ₹2.35 lakh crore estimated shortfall in GST cess collections in 2020-21 without having to worry about principal and interest repayments. The second option allowed States to raise ₹2.35 lakh crore while bearing the interest costs. It found no takers.

The Centre had argued that ₹1.1 lakh crore was the amount that the States would have lost due to GST implementation, and should get full compensation for, while the rest of the shortfall was due to exigencies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Apart from Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir have also decided to exercise the first option.

A special window is being created to facilitate GST-related borrowings, while the present nods for additional borrowing pertain to the additional borrowing flexibility of 0.5% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) that had been offered to States who opted for the first option for GST compensation.

“Under the terms of Option-1, besides getting the facility of a special window for borrowings to meet the shortfall arising out of GST implementation, States are also entitled to get unconditional permission to borrow the final instalment of 0.50% of GSDP out of the 2% additional borrowings permitted by the Government of India, under Atmanirbhar Abhiyaan on 17th May, 2020,” the Finance Ministry said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/61knap/article31329869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/centre-allows-tamil-nadu-to-borrow-an-additional-9627-crore/article32857463.ece
199,2020/10/15,‘Double standards on reservation exposed’,"CM will do anything for BJP alliance: Stalin

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday said the revelation of the Supreme Court that the Tamil Nadu government did not press for the implementation of reservation for the Backward Classes in medical seats surrendered to the central pool was shocking.

“It is shocking and has exposed the double standards of the AIADMK government. It shows that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami will sacrifice anything for an alliance with the BJP,” he said in a statement.

He said the High Court had ordered the implementation of the reservation for the OBCs on a petition filed by the DMK and had directed the State government to constitute a committee to study the issue.

“But when the petition filed by the Tamil Nadu government for implementing reservations came up for hearing at the Supreme Court, it was revealed that the State had not made any demand for its implementation from the current year,” Mr. Stalin said.

He said DMK MP and senior counsel P. Wilson made out a case for implementing the existing 27% reservation, and the court directed the government to find a way to implement the same.

“Though the AIADMK government went to the Supreme Court for its implementation, it has changed its stand in the committee meeting for its feared action in the gutkha case and irregularities in National Highway projects,” Mr. Stalin claimed.

Procurement centres

Mr. Stalin also demanded the opening of more direct procurement centres for procuring paddy from farmers without a ceiling.

In another statement, he said the government’s failure to fully procure produce from farmers had resulted in the destruction of 50,000 paddy sacks in the Kollidam area.

“All procurement centres buy only up to 1,000 sacks and the policy has caused enormous hardship to farmers. It is highly condemnable that the government remains indifferent to the problems of the farmers,” he said. Mr. Stalin said that tonnes of paddy was already lost in the rain because of the government’s failure to open procurement centres, and, now, farmers were keeping their fingers crossed because of the ceiling.

Pointing out that the government had failed to implement the recommendation of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee that farmers should be given an additional 50%, along with the production cost, Mr. Stalin said the government had announced a minimum support price just as a formality.

“The policies give room for suspicion whether both the Centre and the AIADMK government are deliberately doing this to create a hopeless situation for farmers. The governments should give up their anti-farmer policy.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3coaz0/article32857395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/double-standards-on-reservation-exposed/article32857396.ece

The city, battered by the devastating rain on the intervening night between Tuesday and Wednesday, is in the process of staggering on its feet again, as the rain water is slowly receding from its several colonies.

The causeway bridges on Musi River at Chaderghat and Moosarambagh are visible on Thursday, as against the spectacle on Wednesday when they were drowned by the swirling waters cutting off access to the other side.

Residents of Moosanagar, Shankar Nagar and other areas in the river banks got busy cleaning their premises and reorganising their homes, which went under water when the river was full stream.

There are, however, still areas where the water is taking longer to recede. Nadeem Colony in Tolichowki, for instance, still has 12 feet of water, keeping several homes drowned and residents stranded.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the officials of different departments to take up relief and rehabilitation measures on a war footing to alleviate the problems of people on account of the torrential rain that lashed the State in the last couple of days.

Steps should be taken to distribute rice, dal and other essentials to the people affected by rains besides providing three blankets each to households which suffered the damages.

209,2020/10/15,Power cuts make WFH tough for IT workforce,"Holiday today for all govt. offices, private institutions

Their sense of relief at working from home (WFH) as heavy rain pounded many places in the city on Tuesday turned out to be short-lived for many in the IT workforce since little work was possible amid the accompanying power cuts.

Night shift operations were impacted, Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) president Bharani Kumar Aroll said, estimating 10% of those WFH were not able to work.

The impact of the rain on the work in IT companies during the day was not much, but things changed by the evening, he said, referring to the findings of a sample data collected by HYSEA from IT companies of varying sizes.

Power outage was not the only issue as water logging also came in the way. Many of the IT employees, however, ensured WFH by shifting to another location where power supply was available.

“This morning, we worked with government on getting the power up and running [and] getting update that power was restored from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.,” he said on Wednesday.

The power cuts also saw some WFH taking to social media to highlight their plight.

A resident of Madhuranagar in Yousufguda, tweeted to TSSPDCL, saying: “Hello, There is an outage even after the rain has stopped. We don't have power since last night 7 p.m. Please come and fix it. Its really difficult since I am working from home I need power to work.”

Another person asked how to work from home? No light for five hrs. There is lot of pressure from company to complete work, he said in his tweet to the power utility about the power outage in Bagh-e-jahara.

For those with access to stable power connection, WFH proved to be a boon. “One big consolation is that because of Work from home, the horrors of being stuck in and around Hitech city for hours has been avoided this monsoon,” another tweet said.

In the IT hub of Hyderabad, primarily Gachibowli and neighbouring areas there was not much impact of the rain, except the power cuts. There was not much of water logging on the arterial roads, especially the stretch of Old Mumbai Highway. The compound wall of Indian Immunologicals campus was damaged at least in two places.

In the nearby Kondapur, the rain compounded the misery of road users already grappling with bad roads. Serilingampally MLA Gandhi Arekapudi also tweeted pictures of his visit to many rain affected areas, including the Serilingampally division, to monitor the flood relief measures.

The government had declared October 14 and 15 as holiday for all government offices, private institutions, including banks and financial Institutions under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, due to unprecedented incessant rains, except for the staff and offices engaged in relief and emergency services.

Sources in the banking industry, however, said it was only after 1 p.m. the order was passed on to the branches following which the facilities closed and the employees left for the day early. In State Bank of India facilities in the city, around 30-40% of the staffers were unable to attend due to rain, an official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/power-cuts-make-wfh-tough-for-it-workforce/article32857364.ece
210,2020/10/15,Flooding near Musi project puts officials on high alert,"Ayacut not in danger, says Energy Minister

Record flooding from upstream Hyderabad, river Musi along its course in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri, Suryapet, and its project near Kethepally in Nalgonda district, have put officials on high alert and residents and motorists anxious on Wednesday.

The discharge from Himayatsagar after midnight made flooding almost double the previous estimate of irrigation officials.

And starting at 4 a.m., alternative measures were discussed and soon officials prepared themselves to operate the gates.

While the project’s full reservoir level is 645 feet with gross storage of 4.46 tmc, by 7 a.m., the water level exceeded by 1.70 feet, at 646.70 feet, an unprecedented situation, according to officials.

As per the plan, all its crest gates were opened to a height of 20 feet, and about 1.73 lakh cusecs water release was maintained till evening, even as inflows did not show a decline from 1.83 lakh cusecs.

According to officials, it was also crucial to decide to breach the bund of the project at Ratnapuram to reduce the water intensity when it converges at the project gates.

As a result, the flow, which was diverged to Tekumatla, would be back into the river course through the fields and village.

District Collector of Nalgonda Prashant J. Patil, and his Suryapet counterpart T. Vinay Krishna Reddy, visited the project site and took stock of the situation.

Later, returning from the Assembly Session in Hyderabad, Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy was at the site with irrigation officials and discussed the measures taken.

211,2020/10/15,"Naga issue | Only one solution is message from Centre, says Neiphiu Rio","“We need to deliberate and support the peace process,” Nagaland Chief Minister tells civil society groups.

Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio said on Thursday the message from the government of India is clear that there will be only “one solution” for the Naga political issue. Mr. Rio was addressing over 150 members of the civil society groups in Kohima who had met to discuss the ongoing Naga peace talks and the Naga political issue.

He said he met Union Home Minister Amit Shah on September 19 in Delhi and one of the reasons for Thursday’s meeting was to convey the Centre’s “one solution” message.

“Having understood that there will be only one solution, we need to deliberate and support the peace process, strengthen the negotiations and facilitate the journey towards achievement of this one solution in the earliest time possible. Looking back at history, we must come to an understanding that our achievements and our failures are all collective. We need to cross the bridge of blame and move towards a matured approach of collective responsibility for all our achievements and failures,” he said.

The Naga talks hit a roadblock in August this year after the NSCN(IM) leadership refused to hold any dialogue with Naga interlocutor R.N. Ravi who is also Nagaland’s Governor. A team of Intelligence Bureau officials were deputed to hold forth the discussions with National Socialist Council of Ngaland-(Isak Muivah). Mr. Ravi and the NSCN(IM) signed a framework agreement on August 3, 2015 in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The NSCN(IM) has been demanding a separate constitution and flag for the Nagas and the assimilation of all Naga-inhabited areas in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. In 2017, Mr. Ravi included more Naga groups in the dialogue process and signed a preamble with the seven Naga National Political Groups.

“If Nagas as a people are to achieve progress and realise our aspirations as a people, we must come together like today. We must also accept that our biggest challenge today is division. We all know that this situation is only leading to self-destruction. During the British era, a divide and rule policy was used to govern, which was inherited by India, and till today our society is thoroughly divided, which has created too many groups and organisations leading to different opinions and voices. The only way forward is unity and oneness as One Naga Family,” the Chief Minister said.

Following the consultative meeting, the participants including the Nagaland government adopted a resolution appealing the negotiating groups to come together towards achieving one solution for one people as early as possible. BJP MLA Mmhonlumo Kikon, who steered the meeting, said it was affirmed to work in a collective manner to facilitate the peace process and strengthen the negotiations for early realisation of the desired one solution in a transparent manner.

The Opposition Congress party and the Naga People’s Front boycotted the meeting. The Congress released a statement that the Chief minister should step down as the final agreement was to be inked soon and he should avoid being an obstacle in paving way for post solution arrangement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/e9mezn/article32865534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15KRARIO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/only-one-solution-for-naga-political-issue-is-message-from-centre-neiphiu-rio/article32865535.ece
212,2020/10/15,Hapur court awards death penalty for rape of minor,"The District and Sessions Court of Hapur awarded death penalty to two domestic helps for raping and killing a 12-year-old in September 2018 on Thursday. The third accused, Amarjeet, has been acquitted.

In her order, Veena Narayan, Additional District Judge and Special Judge (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences or POCSO Act), Hapur said the convicts, Ankur and Sonu, should be hanged till death, and asked officials to take them into custody. She said the order would be put on hold till the Allahabad High Court upheld it.

The accused have been found guilty under Sections 302, 307, 394, 120B and 411 of the IPC, and Section 6 of the POCSO Act.

The crime, which took place on September 5, 2018, sent shockwaves in the region as the convicts were working as domestic help at the victim’s house for a long time. They not only raped and killed the girl but also attacked her 8-year-old brother with a knife.

According to Vaibhav Pandey, Circle Officer, Hapur (City), 18 witnesses were produced in the court. “We ensured that forensic evidence are collected and the chargesheet wass filed in a fixed time frame. The chargesheet was filed on October 27, 2018,” he added.

Mr. Pandey said the prosecution could not prove charges of criminal conspiracy against Amarjeet, a neighbour of the victim.

Sankalp Sharma, Superintendent of Police, Budaun, who was posted in Hapur at the time of the incident, said the convicts, in their 20s, worked as house helps at the house of the victim’s father, who was in the dairy business. “In an officer’s life, there are cases where you feel that justice should be delivered without any delay. This was one of those cases,” he said.

On the day of the incident, when the victim’s parents were not at home, the accused raped her and when she made noise, they strangulated her. As her brother had seen them committing the crime, they thrashed him and slit his throat.

“It was the brother who identified the accused through brief notes, where he mentioned the names of the domestic helps. He had lost his voice and it took doctors a long time to restore it,” recalled Mr. Sharma.

After the crime, the convicts hid the body of the girl beneath cattle fodder in an adjoining room and tried to present the scene of the crime as if a robbery had been committed. “They tried to mislead the police that dacoits had kidnapped the girl and decamped with money. When the body was recovered and the police took the accused into remand, they accepted their crime,” said Mr. Sharma.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hapur-court-awards-death-penalty-for-rape-of-minor/article32865367.ece

A man was shot dead in the presence of police officers and administrative officials after a dispute broke out between two groups during a village meeting over the selection of a government ration shop in Ballia in eastern Uttar Pradesh on Thursday.

The son of the deceased person claimed that the accused, identified as Dhirendra Pratap Singh, was linked to sitting BJP MLA Surendra Singh though it could not be independently verified.

CM orders suspension

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed that the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), circle officer (of DSP rank) and police personnel on the spot all be suspended immediately, said a government spokesperson.

Strictest action would be taken against the accused and the role of the officers shall be investigated and if responsible, criminal action shall be taken, said the government.

The incident took place in Durjanpur village in Rewati area of Ballia. Visuals from the ground showed a large number of villagers running for cover near a field as several rounds of bullets could be heard being fired.

Ballia Superintendent of Police Devendra Nath said the selection process of a ration shop was on when an argument broke out between two local help groups, one of them supported by Mr. Singh, the accused.

When there was a ruckus, the SDM halted the process and when the rest of the people were leaving, Mr. Singh fired shots, in which one Jai Prakash got shot, said the SP.

Jai Prakash died on the way to hospital, added the officer.

The Ballia police said the body had been sent for autopsy and attempts were being made to arrest the accused.

At least four workers of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate in the Singhat Assembly constituency in Churachandpur district were injured in a murderous attack at 7.30 p.m. on Wednesday near the international border. The unidentified attackers, numbering over 50 and armed with batons and other lethal weapons, managed to escape under cover of darkness. Police said no arrest has been made so far.

Police sources said that supporters of G.S. Haopu, the BJP candidate for the Singhat Assembly constituency for the by-polls to be held on November 7, were returning after visiting some villages. When they were nearing Behang village, some unidentified persons first pelted a cavalcade of vehicles with rocks, causing extensive damage. Four workers were beaten up by the unidentified persons. Some other workers sustained minor injuries, which hospital sources said were not life-threatening. Police said that additional forces were rushed to maintain land order.

A few days ago, there were clashes during which tear gas shells were deployed and live bullets were fired into the air to disperse a mob in the Wangoi Assembly constituency in the Imphal west district, which also goes to by-polls on November 7.

People accused the BJP candidate, Oinma Lukhoi, who is a Minister but not currently an MLA, of opening fire. There were vehement denials from some women activists loyal to the BJP candidate. They said that some supporters of other candidates might have fired and tried to blame the BJP candidate. On Wednesday, some women reminded Mr. Lukhoi’s supporters that the party spokesperson, Y. Nilamani, had said during a news discussion in a local TV channel, “The Minister had to fire from his licensed gun in self defence.” It was pointed out that there were corroborative reports in the local media about this incident, which took place at Iram Siphai.

There have also been reports of pre-election violence in the Muslim-dominated Lilong Assembly constituency. Though the Lilong MLA, Abdul Nasir of the Congress party, had resigned, the BJP has not nominated him. In protest, people in Lilong came out to the streets and they said that if a BJP candidate was not announced soon, they would boycott the by-polls in the constituency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/violent-clashes-mar-run-up-to-by-polls-in-manipur/article32862733.ece
218,2020/10/15,"BJP eyes Bodoland council, hints at dumping ally","The council was dissolved after the elections scheduled in April were deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is eyeing the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) where elections, deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, are expected to be held in December.

Assam Finance and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the BJP would contest the elections to the 40-member council alone, hinting at the widening gap between the saffron party and the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), one of the two regional partners in the government it heads.

The BPF had been ruling the BTC comprising four districts since February 2003, until the council was dissolved after the expiry of the last five-year term on April 27. The dissolution followed the deferment of the elections, earlier scheduled on April 4, due to the COVID-19 restrictions.

“As in the other autonomous councils of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao, we are looking at forming the government in BTC, which will bring about a complete transformation for the development of the areas administered by the council,” Dr. Sarma said during a meeting of the BJP Scheduled Tribe Morcha in western Assam’s Kokrajhar district on October 13.

He later said the alliance with the BPF would depend on how things pan out.

“Our relationship with the BPF at the State level is still intact. We are hopeful of good ties with the BPF and AGP (Asom Gana Parishad) in the next five years as well but the alliance will depend on the prevailing situation,” he said.

The Minister also downplayed speculations about a few BJP legislators and senior leaders joining the BJP. “We cannot say anything about the internal matters of another party,” he said.

The BJP and the BPF have reportedly been drifting apart since the signing of the new Bodo peace accord in January with all the factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB). Leaders of the influential All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU), aligned against the BPF leadership, had played a key role in the accord.

There are allegations that the BJP has been cultivating the leaders of the disbanded NDFB factions as well as the BPF’s rival United People’s Party Liberal headed by former ABSU president Promod Boro.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hx7sm5/article32653424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BISWASARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-eyes-bodoland-council-hints-at-dumping-ally/article32862015.ece

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday stressed that common habits of personal hygiene like washing hands can keep coronavirus infection at bay and help people lead a healthy and disease-free life.

The chief minister emphasised upon the sanitation practice while launching a hath dhona, roke corona” campaign on the occasion of the Global Handwashing Day, an official spokesperson said.

Washing hand is an important part of behaviour through which we can save ourselves from different kinds of diseases. In corona times, washing hands is especially important as there is no medicine for this pandemic and precaution and alertness is the only way to check it, said Adityanath.

The chief minister launched the campaign digitally from his official residence.

Noting that the world observes October 15 as Global Handwashing Day, Adityanath expressed happiness that this programme is being taken forward in the state.

Exuding confidence that all the people would connect with the help of programmes launched under the campaign and will make personal hygiene a part of their daily routine, the chief minister said washing hand is important in breaking the chain of corona infection.

To mark the day, special handwashing programs were organised in all the districts of the state from 10 a.m. to 12 noon.

These programs were held maintaining necessary social distancing norms, the spokesman said.

Meanwhile, girl students of Delhi University staged various kinds of handwashing demonstrations in the background of Taj Mahal in Agra.

The students from the national capital, who are part of hygiene pioneer Sulabh International’s sanitation club, drove to Agra to create awareness about the importance of handwashing amid the COVID pandemic.

220,2020/10/15,"Solapur, western Maharashtra reel under onslaught of retreating monsoon","Relentless overnight rain led to massive property damage in Solapur and Pune districts, with thousands of villagers marooned by rising floodwaters in rural Solapur.

Western Maharashtra and parts of the Marathwada region continued to reel under the onslaught of the retreating monsoon, with Solapur district the worst-hit in the region.

Two teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) stationed in Pune’s Maval Taluk have been urgently deployed for rescue and rehabilitation efforts. While one team has entered the temple-town in Pandharpur in Solapur district, another has been pressed into action in Latur in Marathwada.

Relentless overnight rain led to massive property damage in Solapur and Pune districts, with thousands of villagers marooned by rising floodwaters in rural Solapur.

Rising levels of the Sina River have afflicted residents in at least 100 villages in Madha and Mohol taluks in Solapur, with several livestock being washed away by the floodwaters.

1,000 evacuated

According to the Solapur district administration, at least 1,000 people were evacuated from Pandharpur on Wednesday night while another 6,000 from 500 families are to be shifted to safer zones on Thursday. Authorities of the Vitthal-Rukmini temple trust said that it would take the responsibility of feeding and lodging those evacuated from their homes.

A massive discharge of two lakh cusecs of water commenced from the Ujjani dam since 10 p.m. Wednesday night. With rain providing a temporary reprieve to Solapur on Thursday morning, the discharge has been reduced to one lakh cusecs currently.

The rains have compelled authorities to shut traffic on the Pune-Solapur road, as well as roads connecting Solapur to other districts such as Bijapur in neighbouring Karnataka.

Rising river waters

Intense and continuous showers saw an alarming rise in the water levels of all major rivers in western Maharashtra: the Panchganga in Kolhapur rose by seven ft. owing to massive rainfall throughout Wednesday night, while the Krishna River level in Sangli has risen by five ft in just three hours.

All main roads in Sangli have been closed for traffic as a precautionary measure.

In Pune, overnight showers caused considerable damage to property in the city with furious rainwaters mangling scores of two-wheelers parked in the open.

Four persons on two motorcycles were swept away by the floodwaters in Daund taluk in rural Pune. The bodies of three, including one woman, have been found and the search for the fourth was on.

In Baramati in rural Pune, a flood-like situation prevails as several residents have moved out of their homes to higher grounds for safety.

The rains have led the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) to postpone the final year examinations scheduled on Thursday.

As per a notification put up on its website, SPPU authorities said that it was postponing the varsity’s online and offline exams that were slated on Thursday given the flood-like situation caused by heavy rains experienced on October 14 and the fact that the civic administration had issued a cyclone and heavy rainfall alert for Thursday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/solapur-western-maharashtra-reel-under-onslaught-of-retreating-monsoon/article32860267.ece
221,2020/10/15,Odisha to ramp up disaster management preparedness,"₹205 crore set aside for the purpose, says Chief Secretary.

The Odisha government has decided to take disaster management preparedness to next level by inducting hi-tech equipment, enhancing training and capacity building for which ₹205 crore has been sanctioned for the purpose, a senior official said.

The decision in this regard was taken at the State Executive Committee meeting chaired by Chief Secretary A. K. Tripathy.

“To upgrade disaster preparedness ₹205 crore has been sanctioned for the 2020-21 fiscal,” Mr. Tripathy said on Wednesday.

He said there is a need to upgrade the system in view of the intensity and frequency of natural disasters hitting the State.

The Chief Secretary said apart from natural calamity, the State’s preparedness should also be made in advance for industrial disasters.

He directed the authorities to strengthen the disaster fighting arms of the State with hi-tech equipment and innovative training. Mr. Tripathy emphasised on proper maintenance and upkeep of the equipment through regular institutional arrangements.

The Chief Secretary also complimented the ODRAF (Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force) and Fire Service Units for consistently maintaining a high standard of service in neighbouring West Bengal during Cyclone Amphan.

He said the Fire Service personnel now need to go beyond the traditional fire fighting and develope into ‘First Multi-hazard Responders’

While speaking on the State’s existing preparedness, Additional Chief Secretary and Special Relief Commissioner P K Jena said: “At present, the Odisha Fire Service is equipped to respond to natural disasters in the State and extend helping hand to other States. The new training and equipment would further, sharpen their teeth to deal with different types of disasters“.

The State aimed to procure hi-tech collapsed structure search and rescue (CSSR) equipment and quick deponent antenna (QDA) for ODRAF and Fire Service Units and instruments for disaster management training cell.

He said the Disaster Management Training Cell (DMTC) established in Revenue Officers Training Institute (ROTI), Gothapatana has successfully trained 3,586 persons from ODRAF, Fire Services, Civil Defence, community level volunteers and others in various modules relating to disaster management, search, rescue and first aid.

The new equipment and accessories will be helpful in enhancing the training capacity of the cell, he said, adding that the meeting also reviewed the progress regarding the repair and maintenance of multipurpose cyclone/flood centres (MCS/MFS) operating in different places.

He said a physical audit of 814 shelters operating in 25 districts was completed. Of this, the repair and maintenance of 795 shelters in 23 districts with an investment of ₹45 crore was completed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uf6nfq/article31592414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ASITTRIPATHY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-to-ramp-up-disaster-management-preparedness/article32859742.ece
222,2020/10/15,No cinema halls to reopen in Northeast on Oct 15 despite Centre’s ‘Unlock 5’,"Movie goers will have to wait for some more days as the official notifications are yet to be issued by the States in the region.

The cinema halls in the Northeast will not reopen on October 15 despite the Centre allowing it as part of its ‘Unlock 5’ guidelines as the States have not issued any guidelines in this regard.

Theatres, distributors and content providers said that movie goers will have to wait for some more days as the official notifications are yet to be issued by the States in the region.

Assam government issued an order on Wednesday evening allowing cinema halls to reopen from Thursday in areas outside the containment zones with maximum 50% capacity.

The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) order signed by Assam chief secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna said a separate standard operating procedure regarding theatres will be issued by the health and family welfare department.

Except for Manipur, all the northeastern States have commercial theatres, including multiplexes.

Siddharth Goenka of Goenka Enterprises, Northeast’s largest film distributor, told PTI. “We have not received any notification or confirmation from the government for the opening of the halls. We have also not received any programmes from anywhere,” he said.

As per information from the States, cinema halls will not reopen on Thursday anywhere in the entire region, he added.

“Even if the notification comes tomorrow for opening from Friday, it will take a few more days to actually restart the theatres,” Mr. Goenka said.

Film content provider UFO Moviez India General Manager (Sales and Distribution), Sourav Dutta said the company has only got the Centre’s order but not from the Assam government.

“So, we have not provided any film to any hall even though 10-12 multiplexes are fully ready to operate from Thursday. However, the single screens will take some more days as they are observing the situation and public response,” he added.

Asked about the order issued by the Assam government, Mr. Dutta said the SOP has not been issued yet and it is too late to work out everything for screening films on Thursday.

Carnival Cinema’s Manager Simanta Saikia also confirmed that the company has not received any notification from the Assam government permitting reopening of cinema hall.

Neither has any content provider sent any film.

“It looks unlikely that there will be any show on Thursday. However, we have completed our cleaning and sanitisation process. As the theatres were closed for almost seven months cleaning was a huge task. We have called almost 80% of the staff for the preparatory works,” he added.

Theatres across the country had to shut their doors in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown triggered by it.

The Ministry of Home Affairs in its ‘Unlock 5’ guidelines issued on September 30 allowed the reopening of cinema halls from October 15 with up to 50% of their seating capacity but left it to the states to take the final call on granting them permission.

The ASDMA order also said 50% gatherings up to 200 persons will be allowed to attend social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and political functions in closed spaces from November 15.

“Education Department, Government of Assam will take a decision in respect of reopening of schools and coaching institutions after 15th October in a gradded manner in consultation with Health and Family Welfare Department, based on their assessment of the situation,” it added.

Swimming pools, entertainment parks and business-to-business exhibitions have also been allowed from Thursday, but separate SOPs will be issued by departments concerned, the order said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-cinema-halls-to-reopen-in-northeast-on-oct-15-despite-centres-unlock-5/article32858829.ece
223,2020/10/15,Sikkil Gurucharan’s Navaratri series,"“Art will always find a way to survive even during tough times like the pandemic. The advent of online music and full-length virtual concerts proves that,” says Sikkil Gurucharan. The lockdown helped him rethink and present music in a different way. Result: the ‘Advaitam series’, which he presents this Navaratri, along with B.S. Purushotham on the ganjira, N. Ananthanarayanan on the veena, Mylai Karthikeyan on the nagaswaram, H. Vishwas on the mandolin and Vedanth Bharadwaj on the banjo.

“Several dialogues happen during a concert — between violin and vocal, mridangam and ghatam, vocal and mridangam and so on. The whole concert is full of these moments,” says Gurucharan. While the concert format doesn’t let artists explore this exchange further, Advaitam brings out its nuances and lets them explore the beauty of ragas and talas.

The first season of the series, consisting of five episodes, will be released on Sarvamangala Productions’ YouTube channel. “Each instrument’s speciality is discussed first, followed by musical exchanges based on a theme. For instance, with the veena, the communication happens through Muthuswami Dikshitar kritis, while with the banjo, it’s over folk music,” says Gurucharan. There’s also a change in the vocal element. “I have reversed the format. The instrumentalists play and I follow,” he says.

The series targets young audiences. “The next gen should also get a taste of the excitement of live concerts; that comes only through such dialogues,” he says.

224,2020/10/15,The Satyabhama of Kuchipudi,"Remembering Shobha Naidu, who made the role definitively her own

It’s not often that a dancer becomes synonymous with certain roles. But Shobha Naidu’s artistic journey was defined by the role of Satyabhama, which she performed innumerable times at the insistence of audiences. Her stylish gait, those large expressive eyes, the beautiful smile... she owned the stage from the moment she stepped on it.

As an artiste, I am immensely beholden to her. She inspired me to make dance my calling. When in school, I happened to watch her in the role of Padmavathi in Guru Vempati Chinna Satyam's popular production, ‘Srinivasa Kalyanam’. I recall leaving the hall completely mesmerised. And by the time I reached home, I knew Kuchipudi was where my heart lay. I headed to Chennai to train under the inimitable Guru Vempati.

Like guru, like sishya

Shobha Naidu was not only among the guru’s foremost disciples, but the one who amazingly translated his thoughts and ideas through her dance. She would bring alive the nuances in his choreographic works in her distinct way. I cannot forget her brilliant portrayal of Chandalika. She tugged at our heartstrings with her abhinaya in ‘Enduku Naki Shapamaya’. She used to recount how, when master was choreographing ‘Oyi Dinajanavana’ for her, he remarked in anger one day that she was unfit to dance. This pushed her to practise relentlessly till he finally nodded in appreciation. They made a great guru-sishya combination.

Shobha’s appeal cut across dance styles, and she was able to popularise Kuchipudi around the world. What set her apart as a dancer was also her versatility; she could play any role with ease, including male roles.

A warm and humble person off stage, she would transform into a striking performer once she donned the costume and put on the make-up.

In the past few years, Shobha had dedicated herself to grooming young enthusiasts in the idiom. A loving and generous guru, she would guide them in every possible way. Whenever I invited her to Deepanjali, my dance school, she would always turn up and wholeheartedly appreciate something she liked. At the same time, she would also point out all the flaws in the most polite manner. The moment I heard of her demise, I scrolled though the complimentary messages she sent me after watching my tribute video to Covid workers.

A few years ago, while preparing for a Kuchipudi festival themed on Annamacharya kritis, when I came to know she would be performing her favourite piece, ‘Paluku Tenela Talli’, I called her up to request if I could do it instead. She immediately agreed. ‘I will do ‘Okapari Kokapari,’’ she said. For me, each time I have watched Shobha perform ‘Paluku Tenela Talli’, it has taken me closer to my art.

In the shifting cultural dynamics of today, she held on to her traditional moorings, bringing alive age-old padams and javalis. If we look at the trajectory of her work, both as a soloist and a choreographer, we will understand what gave her the strength to rule the world of Kuchipudi till her last breath. The rhythm of her gajjalu (bells) will continue to echo.

225,2020/10/15,How young dancers are reinterpreting Shakti,"Five classical dancers define the concept of feminine power in the contemporary context

Dance was once an ornament, displayed at temples, royal courts and during functions in the houses of the rich. What mattered most were the aesthetics of the form, the beauty of the dancer, and technical proficiency. But somewhere during its journey to the proscenium, the dancer too embarked on an inward journey, realising the liberating expression of the art form and how it is as much about an agile body as it is about emotional and personal strength. The dancer, who had till then equated Shakti only with the goddess, began to expand the idea and experience the concept as something defining herself, which spurred her to perceive and perform the art purely on her terms.

Over the decades, the concept of Shakti has been explored in various classical dance styles through traditional compositions and contemporary choreography. From a revered image to a relevant idea rooted in current social contexts, Shakti has inspired dancers, both female and male, to experiment and come up with intense narratives.

Five young dancers describe how the term for them extends beyond the nine days of Navaratri, and is much more than a symbolic representation of divinity in their art.

“As a child,” says Kuchipudi artiste Prateeksha Kashi, it was just a simple and straightforward concept of victory of good over evil. “As I matured, the many layers of Shakti came alive. And I gradually realised it is not just a word but a process. It is the power to love, to imagine, to endure and to let go. We have always found inspiration in the life stories of great artistes who transformed their pain and struggle into Shakti.”

Prateeksha Kashi

Myriad forms

Besides Devi tarangams that are part of the Kuchipudi repertoire, Prateeksha’s mother, senior dancer-choreographer Vyjayanthi Kashi, choreographed a production on Kanyakumari. “Despite being angry and dejected when Lord Shiva fails to return as promised and marry her, the goddess doesn’t forget the task assigned to her by the Devas to kill demon Banasura. Devi seems to reiterate the essence of Shakti here as not losing the purpose of life despite things not happening as you desire,” says Prateesksha.

Interestingly, in a society that has for long viewed woman as one who needs to be protected and saved, it is ironic, points out Odissi dancer Arushi Mudgal, that our ancient texts are full of instances where, each time the world is threatened by a demon, it is Shakti who has taken different avatars to come and vanquish the asuras, thereby becoming the one who protects.

Arushi Mudgal

“Shakti has been given several names and described in various forms. Each form has individual attributes; an individual ‘shakti.’ Nurturing, loving, giving, forgiving, protecting, yet fierce. What I find interesting is that these qualities and names ultimately belong to the same energy. To me, it is a reminder of how we too as individuals have several, and at times conflicting, qualities coexisting in us. At once, the idea of labelling gets shattered,” says Arushi, who has trained under her Odissi exponent aunt Madhavi Mudgal.

Bharatanatyam dancer Shweta Prachande sees Shakti manifesting in everything and everyone — it could be the ASHA workers spreading hope during the pandemic, women balancing work and home, or modern artistes striving to keep traditional art forms alive.

“To me, what makes art a powerful advocacy tool is its ability sometimes to paint an entirely parallel universe that reflects what we hope for and sometimes its ability to mirror reality. As artistes, we have the power or shakti to explore, interpret and engage with an idea the way we want to. It feels nice when art influences dialogue or people’s thinking,” says Shweta, a student of Priyadarsini Govind.

How does a male dancer perceive Shakti, the quintessential feminine form and energy? Artistic director of Punyah Dance Company, Bengaluru, Parshwanath Upadhye, experiences it in the energies of nature. “It may take a long time for an artiste to realise this power,” he says. “It may be in the form of one’s mother, friends, other family members or even students. Shakti is similar to a tree. What we reap is what we sow. Whatever kind of energy we dwell in, we become that. And unintentionally that reflects in my choreographies. For the past few years, I have been starting my solo performances with compositions on Devi.”

Parshwanath’s recent production ‘Abha’ was based on Sita. “It’s never been a conscious decision. Yet, the state of mind I am in while either choreographing or presenting a Devi work is impeccable,” he says.

Parshwanath Upadhya,

Sharing power

In the context of Shiva and Shakti, what strikes Arushi is the idea of equality. “They are as independent as they are incomplete without each other. There is a sense of irony there, yet it is the point of ultimate balance. In the form of Ardhanarishwar, we depict one side as Shiva and the other as Shakti. For me, the qualities that we choose to label as masculine and feminine coexist in the same form: perhaps Shiva as feminine and Shakti as masculine too? And why not?

For Kathak dancer Gauri Diwakar, understanding Shakti helped gain deeper insight into her dance form. “I realised power is not in the brisk whirls or footwork, it is in the intent, as my guru Aditi Mangaldas always emphasises. It defines the spirit with which you approach your art.”

Gauri Diwakar

Born during Durga Puja, Gauri says that she has always felt a strong connect with the concept of Shakti. “You could choreograph the most amazing moves, strike statuesque poses, turn your face into a canvas of expressions, but unless the art is spiritually elevating it cannot stir the soul. And that defines my art’s shakti.”

As these youngsters practise age-old art forms, it is not as much a need as a strong desire to try and draw parallels between the ancient texts they study, the pieces they perform, and the deities they describe in dance with the times that they live in.

“Perhaps it’s an attempt to find relevance in what we do,” says Arushi Mudgal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/x3z90p/article32865279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16FRSHWETA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/how-young-dancers-are-reinterpreting-shakti/article32865284.ece
226,2020/10/15,Empowered woman was the focus of Sobha Naidu’s ballets,"Kuchipudi veteran Sobha Naidu who passed away on October 14, influenced a generation of dancers to take up Kuchipudi and trained them into consummate artistes

She was born to play Satyabhama — was the unanimous opinion of critics and rasikas always. She excelled playing the strong consort of Krishna in the ballets Bhama Kalapam and Sri Krishna Parijatam. The audience would wait for the scene where Krishna arrives to pacify a sulking Satyabhama, and Sobha never disappointed. Her quick-moving facial expressions, her body language that ranged from, anger, anxiety, possessiveness — she would show it all fluidly.

She carried similar, but emotionally different allure, as Padmavathi in her favourite Kalyana Srinivasam. Each time she staged this magnum opus, the auditorium would be packed by an appreciative audience. A close study of her repertoire will show the empowered woman at the centre of her dance narratives. Chandalika, based on Tagore’s Bengali play, is another ballet Sobha portrayed with élan. A woman’s struggle to be accepted in society and eventually finding her love, Sobha was a treat with her heart-rendering yet the strong-willed portrayal of Chandalika.

When Sobha chose to present Vipra Narayana, critics felt she was taking on a big challenge as it was already a popular movie. Yet again, Sobha came up with beautiful choreography and the late Devulapalli Krishna Sastri’s script and Balantrapu Rajanikanta Rao’s music ensured this ballet remained one of Sobha’s best ballets.

In Vijayostu te Naari (Triumph of the woman) Sobha motivated women to be independent and drew parallels from mythology to steer a path.

Students from far and beyond

This writer is reminded of what Sobha said nearly 28 years ago on her visit to her Kuchipudi Arts Academy in Domalguda. “Anybody can dance, provided you have the passion and willingness to practice and perfect the form,” she stated introducing me to her two Russian students. A student of Vempati Chinna Satyam, Sobha inspired the first generation of Kuchipudi dancers in the city.

Says renowned Kuchipudi dancer Deepika Reddy, “She was not just an inspiration and a pillar of strength to me but an icon and flag bearer of the Kuchipudi art form. No one can fill this void. She had a deep affection for me. She was large-hearted and generous with her praise. She was always there to encourage me and was the chief guest for the ‘Rangapravesam’ of my first student. She would come and watch many of my dance dramas and give valuable inputs.”

Recalls Mohan Hemmadi of Surmandal, “I met Sobha ji through guru Vempati Chinna Satyam in 1980 for the first time and we organised her Kuchiupudi performance along with Protima Bedi and Chitra Vishweshwaran who gave Odissi and Bharatanatyam recitals respectively. We are shocked at her demise. It’s a loss to Kuchipudi.”

While her ballets were masterpieces, Sobha’s solo recitals were what every dance student would take inspiration from — be it her immense stage presence, her subtle connect with the audience and perfect synchronisation with nattuvangam and the accompanying artistes. Her form was rooted in tradition while her theme and message travelled beyond the realm of art.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/r8xx65/article32861132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KSOBHANAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/tribute-empowered-woman-was-the-focus-of-sobha-naidus-ballets/article32861137.ece

With Rahul (61 n.o., 49b, 1x4, 5x6) and comeback man Chris Gayle (53, 45b, 1x4, 5x6) at the wicket, seven runs from the last two overs should have been a walk in the park.

Just five came off the 19th over bowled by Isuru Udana, but only two were required off six balls. But Yuzvendra Chahal kept Gayle — who did well to overcome the rustiness of not playing a game for nine months — quiet for the first two balls.

The scores were tied — at 171 — when the ‘Universe Boss’ was run out off the penultimate ball.

He was called through for a non-existent single by Rahul, who only managed two runs off six balls in the 19th and 20th overs.

Fortunately Pooran took charge, stepping out and hitting the final ball over long-on. KXIP's only other win this season was also against RCB.

Sigh of relief

Rahul must have heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Pooran clear the fence. The skipper had played some glorious strokes, like the pull over square-leg off Navdeep Saini.

Along with Mayank Agarwal (45, 25b, 4x4, 3x6), he added 78 for the first wicket. And for once, the big runs from the openers were translated into points.

Earlier, captain Virat Kohli, in his 200th game for RCB, top-scored with 48 (39b, 3x4), but his side was restricted well by the KXIP bowlers, led by leg-spinner M. Ashwin.

If it wasn’t for the 24 runs clobbered in the final over by Chris Morris (25 not out, 8b, 1x4, 3x6) and Udana off Mohammed Shami, RCB likely wouldn’t have been in the game.

Before the nightmare, though, Shami had bowled a dream over in which he dismissed both Kohli and A.B. de Villiers.

The South African genius had come in too late, however, with RCB promoting left-handers Washington Sundar and Shivam Dube to tackle leg-spin.

The decision raised questions, especially given what de Villiers managed in his previous outing in Sharjah, earlier this week, when he single-handedly put the game beyond Kolkata Knight Riders.

228,2020/10/15,IPL 2020 | Mumbai Indians start favourites against KKR; question-mark over Narine,"Mumbai Indians are unlikely to tinker with their playing XI.

An explosive batting line-up and a lethal-at-death bowling attack will give defending champions Mumbai Indians a definitive edge over Kolkata Knight Riders when the two teams clash in an IPL game here on Friday.

The defending champions are on a roll having won their last four games, while there are problems aplenty for KKR, who were decimated by the Royal Challengers Bangalore by 82 runs in their last game.

Mumbai Indians are thus unlikely to tinker with their playing XI.

For KKR, questions remain as to whether their key spinner Sunil Narine, who has been once reported for suspect bowling action, will play or not. He had missed the game against RCB even as KKR hoped for an “early resolution” to the issues surrounding his controversial action.

In the event of Narine missing out again, Mumbai will fancy their chances even more at the Sheikh Zayed stadium, where skipper Rohit Sharma has scored both his half-centuries this season.

Sharma (216 runs), on his day, can pummel any attack to submission and particularly enjoys playing against Kolkata. When the two teams met last, Mumbai rode on his belligerent 80 to register a 49-run win.

Apart from Sharma, the Mumbai top and middle-order is in good form — be it Quinton De Kock (191 runs) or Suryakumar Yadav (233 runs), who would like to continue in the same vein.

Ishan Kishan (186 runs) underlined his potential with a blistering 99 against RCB, but the Jharkhand player needs to convert his starts into big scores to make his presence felt.

Mumbai Indians coach Mahela Jayawardene would be pleased with the likes of Hardik Pandya and swashbuckling Kieron Pollard, who have been launching into the opposition attack with their big-hitting prowess along with Krunal Pandya.

Given the trio’s abilities, they can rip apart the KKR attack, especially one sans Narine.

Also read: Indian Premier League 2020 | Teams, schedules and statistics

On the bowling front too, Mumbai looks a settled unit with Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah providing early breakthroughs. They are complemented by Australian James Pattinson and the trio has accounted for 31 wickets.

Spinners Rahul Chahar and Krunal will be again looking to contain the KKR batters.

Meanwhile, the biggest drawback for KKR is the inconsistent performance of their batsmen, particularly Andre Russell, who has just managed a meagre 71 runs from seven games.

There was talk of Russell being promoted up the order, but he continues to bat down and hasn’t done justice to his abilities.

Kolkata also possesses a number of batsmen who can take any attack to cleaners. It comprises the young and elegant Shubman Gill, England’s World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan, Nitish Rana and skipper Dinesh Karthik, but they have not got going barring the odd game.

The management would be hoping that come Friday, they fire in unison to reduce pressure on young guns Rahul Tripathi and Tom Banton.

KKR bowlers did well to fashion narrow victories against Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings, but were profligate against RCB when Pat Cummins and Prasidh Krishan leaked 38 and 42 runs respectively.

They would want to forget the hammering and regain form.

KKR may also look to play Kuldeep Yadav, who was dropped after playing just three games, in place of a third pacer.

He can come in handy along with mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who was economical in the game against RCB.

Teams (From):

Kolkata Knight Riders: Dinesh Karthik (Captain), Eoin Morgan, Nitish Rana, Rahul Tripathi, Rinku Singh, Shubman Gill, Siddhesh Lad, Ali Khan, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Kuldeep Yadav, Lockie Ferguson, Pat Cummins, Prasidh Krishna, Sandeep Warrior, Shivam Mavi, Varun Chakravarthy, Andre Russell, Chris Green, M Siddharth, Sunil Narine, Nikhil Naik, Tom Banton.

Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma (Captain), Aditya Tare, Anmolpreet Singh, Anukul Roy, Chris Lynn, Dhawal Kulkarni, Digvijay Deshmukh, Hardik Pandya, Ishan Kishan, James Pattison, Jasprit Bumrah, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Mitchell McClenaghan, Mohsin Khan, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Prince Balwant Rai, Quinton De Kock, Rahul Chahar, Saurabh Tiwary, Sherfane Rutherford, Suryakumar Yadav, Trent Boult.

229,2020/10/15,Delhi Capitals vs Rajasthan Royals | Anrich Nortje bowls fastest ball in IPL history,"The 26-year-old South African eclipsed compatriot Dale Steyn's effort of 154.40 km per hour set in 2012, clocking 154.74 kph and 155.21 kph in the game at Dubai

South African pace bowler Anrich Nortje bowled the fastest ball in Indian Premier League (IPL) history on Wednesday during his team Delhi Capitals' 13-run victory over Rajasthan Royals.

The 26-year-old eclipsed compatriot Dale Steyn's effort of 154.40 km per hour set in 2012, clocking 154.74 kph and 155.21 kph in the game at Dubai before his best effort of 156.22 kph was scooped for a boundary by Rajasthan's Jos Buttler.

Nortje responded immediately with another fiery delivery in the third over to bowl out the England batsman. He finished the match with figures of 2-33 from four overs to take his wicket tally for the season to 10 from eight games.

“I didn't know about it (the fastest ball). I've been working really hard to get the pace up ... but obviously you want to land it in the right areas. That's the most important thing,” Nortje said in an interview.

Rajasthan, who were chasing 162 for victory, fell short of their target making 148-8 in 20 overs with Australian batsman Steve Smith having another disappointing outing managing only one run.

Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer is in pain after hurting his left shoulder and a complete picture will only emerge after his scan reports arrive, said stand-in captain Shikhar Dhawan after their team beat Rajasthan Royals by 13 runs in an IPL game in Dubai on October 14.

Iyer hurt his left shoulder while trying to effect a diving stop during RR innings and had to leave the field due to severe pain.

“He (Iyer) is in pain but good thing is he is able to move his shoulder. I haven’t spoken to him at length. We’ll get proper report tomorrow,” said stand-in captain Dhawan, who really led well during the end stages.

“One moment it was quite even and to pick it back from there was a team effort. It was important we stay positive as a team. I knew their batting isn’t deep and if we got their top-order we can get them,” the seasoned India international said.

Dhawan was all praise for his pacers, including Purple Cap winner Kagiso Rabada (18 wickets) and the fastest bowler in world cricket Anrich Nortje.

“Every time, we want them to deliver they’re delivering,” Dhawan said.

He also praised debutant Tushar Deshpande.

“He showed courage. The line and length he bowled was amazing. We have to keep the momentum. It’s a long tournament. We will keep the process going,” Dhawan said.

Losing captain Steve Smith pointed out the slowness of the track being one of the reasons for the defeat.

“It was disappointing. The wicket slowed up a bit as the game went on. We got off to a good start with Jos [Buttler] and [Ben Stokes] Stokesy, then we lost a couple wickets and got another partnership between Stokesy and Sanju [Samson], then again lost wickets in clumps and on slow wickets it is hard to make up too many runs at the back-end,” Smith said.

“We needed to take it a bit deeper from some of our batters and we were not able to do that. We thought we bowled well at the back-end and restricted them to 160-odd, that was probably around par on this wicket,” the Royals skipper said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/q25h1m/article32858501.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-SHIKHARDHAWAN-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-dc-vs-rr-shreyas-is-in-pain-but-is-able-to-move-shoulder-dhawan/article32858502.ece

Automatic number plate detection cameras installed by the Coimbatore City Police in collaboration with people's initiative “Uyir” are ready for integration with the Central Government's vehicle registry, Vahan.

Senior police officials and resource persons who are part of the initiative said a trial in integrating the feeds from the advanced cameras installed at 20 traffic signals was under way.

A mega event will be held to launch the initiative, which will be first of its kind in Tamil Nadu, and among the very few across the country, said the officials.

The instructions were given recently following complaints that the rules were not complied with at many locations in Coimbatore district. “While the existing transformers cannot be shifted, efforts will be taken to ensure that the new ones are erected according to the norms,” said a senior official of Tangedco here.

K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, said that according to the TNERC distribution code, if a premises had a total floor area of 900 sq.mt and above or the total demand of all LT services in the building exceeds 150 KW, it should have a distribution transformer within the premises.

The developer should have given space open to sky for the same and guidelines have been issued on the area to be earmarked. The planning authorities issue the building plan approval only if the area was earmarked. However, there were violations and the space required was not provided in several buildings. This led to violation of safety norms too. The public, neighbours, and residents of the building were at risk. Tangedco should not erect transformers outside the building in such cases.

“No one is competent to relax the line clearance and space required for the transformer. This irregularity can be noticed by anyone walking on the road. In most cases, the horizontal clearance is not available. And yet, the power connections were provided,” he said.

242,2020/10/15,SIEMA seeks quality and energy efficiency standards for industrial pumps,"The Central government should bring in energy efficiency standards and mandatory Bureau of Indian Standards (ISI) marking for industrial pumpsets, according to K.V. Karthik, the newly-elected president of the Southern India Engineering Manufacturers Association (SIEMA).

Mr. Karthik told The Hindu that industrial pumpsets are manufactured or supplied in the country mainly by international players and they follow international norms. However, not all these pumps comply with the energy efficiency standards in India. These pumps, used largely in power and water utility segments, should also be covered under the Indian quality and energy efficiency standards.

Further, the solar powered water pumping programme of the Central government has not taken off as expected. The government should modify some of the policy guidelines for the programme to succeed and the Association has given its suggestions, he said. “Manufacturers in Coimbatore should find an entry into the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy programmes,” he said. The Association will work for this in the coming months.

Another focus area for SIEMA will be increasing the share of Coimbatore pumpset manufacturers in the Indian market. Currently, the manufacturers enjoy 55 % share, supplying mainly agriculture and domestic pumps. The market offers potential for the manufacturers here to expand their presence.

V. Krishnakumar, the out-going president of the Association, said the pumpset industry was able to regain its lost business and survive with the resources available during the last few months. SIEMA represented to the government the difficulties faced by the industry and was instrumental in bringing pumpsets under the category of essential agricultural implement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/siema-seeks-quality-and-energy-efficiency-standards-for-industrial-pumps/article32865235.ece

A similar attempt was made a few days ago by creating a fake email id of the Nilgiris District Collector J. Innocent Divya, and mails were sent to district administration officials to purchase gift cards from online retailers.

In a press release, the Tea Board said that a fake email address – chiefexecutive191@gmail.com had been created in the name of Mr. Balaji, an IAS officer.

By impersonating him, the scammers had tried to get money from the members of the tea industry and the public. Based on a complaint, the Nilgiris district police registered a case and were investigating.

In initial stages of the pandemic, the Health Department used to subject the family members and close contacts to testing even if they did not have symptoms.

According to the Health Department, 15 facilities in the district are offering COVID-19 testing. Of these, Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and the Government Medical College and ESI Hospital are the only Government facilities.

On rumours on social media that government agencies and private laboratories get paid for more COVID-19 tests, officials clarified that private laboratories did not get any incentive from the Government for conducting more tests. As private laboratories were supposed to enter the details of tested persons in the Government portal, room for manipulation of results was very less, they said.

Meanwhile, allegations have been levelled against certain private hospitals that they asked about the salary and profession of COVID-19 patients before admitting them.

Sources with a few private hospitals in Coimbatore said that details such as the profession of the patient were collected as part of preparing the patient registry and hospital record but income or salary of patients was not asked as part of admission procedure.

Joint Director of Health Services P.

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Thursday issued directions for imposing a fine of ₹ 20 lakh on the Delhi government’s Public Works Department (PWD) for violating dust control guidelines during the construction of a drain near Burari police station.

“Despite strict directions from the Delhi government, the agency has been blatantly flouting dust control norms. I have issued directions to impose a fine of ₹ 20 lakh on PWD,” he said.

The minister directed the PWD to take steps to prevent dust from blowing out, such as installing wind barriers, covering mounds of dust with nets and water sprinkling.

“I will again send an inspection (team) there. We will again impose a fine of ₹ 20 lakh if proper measures are not taken,” he said.

246,2020/10/15,"Delhi pollution | Switch off engines at traffic signals, says Kejriwal","Chief Minister launches ‘Red light on, gaadi off’ campaign.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday appealed to motorists to switch off their engines at traffic signals as part of a government campaign to reduce local factors contributing to air pollution in the Capital.

Mr. Kejriwal said the “Red light on, gaadi (car) off” campaign could lead to significant reductions in pollution levels even if 10% of the total vehicular users of the city participated in the campaign.

“While we can’t do much about what is happening in neighbouring States, we are launching a campaign today to address the issue of air pollution the best we can locally,” Mr. Kejriwal said during a digital briefing.

“There are 1 crore vehicles registered in Delhi; scientists have told me that even if 10 lakh vehicles switch their engines off at red light signals it can massively reduce both PM 10 and PM 2.5 levels per year,” he also said.

According to Mr. Kejriwal, there could be a reduction of 1.4 tonnes in PM 10 and 0.4 tonnes in PM 2.5 levels if 10 lakh vehicles became part of the campaign.

Since each vehicle spends at least an estimated 15 to 20 minutes at traffic signals per day in the city, switching off the engine could lead to savings of around 200 ml of fuel per day amounting to a possible reduction of ₹7,000 on fuel expenses per year per vehicle.

“I appeal to all vehicles drivers: truck, car, two wheeler drivers, everyone to please participate in this campaign; we will be launching a massive awareness campaign on this in the city over the coming days, please help us to reduce pollution locally by participating,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/envyxk/article32701639.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KEJRIWAL-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-pollution-switch-off-engines-at-traffic-signals-says-kejriwal/article32860349.ece

248,2020/10/15,Three held for duping people over govt. jobs,"The accused created fake website of Central Public Works Department

Three men have been arrested for allegedly creating a fake website of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) and duping unemployed youth on the pretext of providing them government jobs, police said on Wednesday.

The accused, Amit Kumar (27), Ramdayal Lal (27) and Gurdeep (28) created a website similar to the official website of the CPWD and to make it look authentic, they copied contents from the original website www.cpwd.gov.in. They conducted fake exam and also offered appointment to victims, they said.

The police said that Amit Kumar, a BTech drop-out from an engineering college in Dehradun is the kingpin of the gang. After quitting his job as a toll clerk on a highway, he duped unemployed youth on the pretext of job offers.

So far, more than 50 unemployed youth have been cheated for around ₹10-₹12 lakh by the accused. With the cheated money, Amit has purchased a plot in Lucknow and a car, the police said.

A probe was initiated in the matter after complaints were received at South Avenue police station by a senior CPWD official of Nirman Bhawan, New Delhi.

During investigation, mobile number from which the fake website was created was ascertained by technical and cyber analysis following which one of the accused -- Ram Dayal was identified, a police officer said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said “On Monday, our team received information that the creators of the fake website involved in duping youngsters on the pretext of providing jobs would be coming to Mahipalpur. A trap was laid and all the three accused were arrested.”

One laptop, five smartphones, including one iPhone and fake ID and visiting cards of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) were recovered from them, the police said.

It was revealed that Amit Kumar introduced himself as an engineer in CPWD (NHAI). To prove his antecedents, he even got himself a fake ID card of NHAI to impress people. Unemployed youth in his acquaintance group were also impressed and asked him to get them a government job as well, the officer said.

In 2018, he quit his toll clerk job and got a fake website www.cpwd.co.in created from a web designer in Lucknow and started duping unemployed youth. But the fake website did not last long and was shut down due to some reason, Amit said.

Thereafter, he came in contact with Ram Dayal and Gurdeep through another website. The duo had been running web-designing and website creation work in Rajasthan. Amit introduced himself as project manager in CPWD of Kerala and asked them to create CPWD website, he added.

The duo suspected Amit and confronted him but he managed to lure them by assuring big returns and also to include them in his plans. They, then created a fake website www.cpwdgov.in and started cheating the youth, the DCP said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/three-held-for-duping-people-over-govt-jobs/article32857466.ece

256,2020/10/15,Ban on diesel generators in NCR from today,"Air quality of Delhi and Gurugram improves slightly but continues to remain in ‘poor’ category, according to CPCB data

The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram and Noida improved slightly but continued to remain in the ‘poor’ category on Wednesday, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

A ban on diesel generators, except for emergency purposes, will come into force in Delhi and neighbouring cities from Thursday as part of the Graded Response Action Plan to control air pollution, as announced by the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi is likely to stay at the higher end of ‘poor’ or lower end of ‘very poor’ category on Thursday. It is expected to improve marginally on Friday and Saturday, according to government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).

The AQI of Delhi was 276 on Wednesday, down from 300 on Tuesday, as per CPCB data. The AQI of Gurugram was 279, slightly less than 288 on Tuesday. Noida’s AQI also decreased to 273, from 286 on Tuesday.

The AQI for the three cities are the average values of the past 24 hours, which is released by the CPCB at 4 p.m. every day, and treated as the official figures.

Stubble effect

At a meeting with officials of Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, the EPCA has told officials to take “all efforts” to supply machinery to farmers on an “urgent basis” to control stubble burning. SAFAR has stated that stubble burning in neighbouring States is expected to contribute “minimally” to Delhi’s pollution due to wind direction for now.

Last week, the Supreme Court-appointed EPCA had directed Delhi and neighbouring States to implement air pollution control measures under “very poor” and “severe” category of the GRAP from October 15, including a ban on use of diesel generators.

On Wednesday, the EPCA wrote to the Chief Secretaries of Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab that diesel generators will be allowed only for medical purposes, elevators, railways, metro activities, airports, and interstate bus terminals.

“Any deterioration in ambient air quality in the region during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic would have considerable ramifications in terms of health of the residents of Delhi-NCR,” EPCA chairman Bhure Lal said in the letter.

In a related development, AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said that diesel generators are used in Haryana despite Supreme Court orders and that the EPCA should take action against them.

‘Haryana yet to act’

“As the GRAP will come into force from October 15, the use of diesel gensets will be banned in the regions of Delhi-NCR, but Haryana doesn’t seem to want to take any action. Their government has written ‘distress letters’ to the EPCA repeatedly, saying that they can’t enforce the ban in their State,” Mr. Chadha said.

Societies to be affected

Meanwhile, over 15,000 residents in the Millennium City, including 650 families in The Crest at DLF Phase-V, could be impacted by the ban on generator sets.

Three group housing societies, including DLF’s Camellias and The Crest in DLF Phase-V, don’t have regular power connection and are entirely dependent on diesel generators.

Chief engineer, Smart City Project, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, Vineeta Singh told The Hindu that two DLF Phase-V group housing societies and one in Manesar, with total population of around 2,000 residents, do not have power grid connection.

Besides, 19 group housing societies across Gurugram, with a total population of around 13,000 residents, have partial load from the grid and were dependent on the generator sets to meet their power needs.

Ms. Singh said a total of 97 power connections, including commercial establishments, were pending last year due to deficiencies on the part of developers/consumers and 18 were granted connections so far.

“In all these pending cases, either the fees are pending or the infrastructure is not complete. For instance, DLF has to set up two sub-stations of 220 KV and 350 KV capacity as per their original plan, but have set up only one sub-station and two transformers,” she said.

Ms. Singh said that DHBVN had constrains in seven cases last year, but all deficiencies were met.

257,2020/10/15,Another accused gets bail in riots case,"HC quizzes police over delay in inclusion of name in FIR

The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a man arrested in connection with the north-east Delhi riots in February, noting that the police has not been able to explain why there was a delay of seven days before his name was added in the FIR.

Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said it was not in dispute that the incident took place on February 25, but the statements of two constables who were on duty and saw the incident as well as identified the accused, Kasim, was recorded only on March 3. “There is no explanation as to why the police officials did not make a PCR call/DD (daily diary) entry to the concerned police station regarding involvement of petitioner on February 25,” the High Court said.

Justice Kait noted that Kasim’s name was added only after a person, allegedly injured in the riots, recorded his statement on March 3 in which he named Kasim. After this, the constables made their statements and also identified the accused.

The HC further noted that as per the chargesheet, 11 videos showed the riots on February 24 and 25 at the crime spot, and at the house of former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain. “It is also not in dispute that co-accused Mr. Hussain and Liyakat were seen in the CCTV footage, however, petitioner [Kasim] is not seen in any of the 11 videos,” said Justice Kait.

The special public prosecutor had argued that Kasim is a ‘Bad Character’ of the area and there are 10 cases against him due to which the constables knew Kasim and were able to identify him.

The injured person who identified some of the rioters, including Kasim, stated that he was near Mr. Hussain’s house around 4 p.m. on February 25 and saw an angry mob on the terrace pelting stones, firing guns, throwing petrol bombs, and chanting communal slogans. During the violence, the person was allegedly shot in his shoulder.

Around 4:00 pm, he came out of his house to purchase some household articles and when he reached near Lakhpat School, Chand Bagh, he found that riots broke out in the whole area.

When he reached near Tahir Hussain’s house, he saw angry mob on the terrace of the said house, who were pelting stones, firing gun shots and throwing petrol bombs upon the houses of Hindu community.

He said that the mob was chanting anti-communal slogans. Later, one of the boys namely, Gulfam, fired upon him which hit on his right shoulder. He identified the other accused including Tahir Hussain, Shah Alam, Tanveer Malik, Nazeem and Kasim.

When the HC asked the police about Kasim’s phone location, the special public prosecutor stated that Kasim’s phone was not in ‘active mode’ from February 17 to March 23 so phone location could not be done.

“Without commenting on the merits of the case and in view of the aforesaid facts, this court is inclined to grant bail to the petitioner,” the High Court stated.

The High Court recently granted bail to another man charged with rioting in a Delhi riots case, after noting that there is no CCTV footage, video clip or photo to corroborate the prosecution’s claim.

Justice Kait ordered that Mohd. Rehman be released on bail, if not required in any other case, on his furnishing a personal bond of ₹25,000 with one surety of like amount.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pdh41j/article32417347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL22-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/another-accused-gets-bail-in-riots-case/article32857290.ece
258,2020/10/15,Yadav touring Haryana to review crop buying,"Swaraj India president appeals to farmers to join agitation on farm Acts in Sirsa

Coinciding with the “MSP Adhikar Divas” observed by All-India Kisan Sangarsh Co-ordination Committee, a conglomeration of around 250 farmers groups, on Wednesday, Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav set out on a tour across Haryana to take stock of the procurement of Kharif crops and create awareness on three farm legislations.

Holding a press conference here, Mr. Yadav said he would visit the grains markets in neighbouring Nuh to begin with and reach Sirsa, the epicentre of the farmers protests in Haryana against the controversial legislations, on October 18. He will travel through Rewari, Mahendragarh, Charkhi Dadri and Bhiwani.

No response from govt.

“We have been visiting the grains markets for the past four years in the State and sent suggestions to the government to improve procurement. But there is no reply,” said Mr. Yadav.

Maintaining that the sit-in at Sirsa’s Shaheed Bhagat Singh Stadium would continue till the farmers’ demand to rollback three legislations is met, Mr. Yadav conceded that the protests against the new laws in Haryana were mostly confined to the districts bordering Punjab. He added that the farmers in south Haryana were in fact affected more and there was a need to create awareness among them. He, however, said that protests were held at around 10,000 sites across 20 States on September 25 in response to the call for “Bharat bandh”, indicating widespread resentment.

Mr. Yadav also made an appeal to the farmers across the State to come and join the agitation at Sirsa.

He said that AIKSCC had decided to observe October 14 as “MSP Adhikar Divas” to expose government on the issue of Minimum Support Price. Saying that MSP was a “fraud” and “loot”, Mr. Yadav claimed that government announced the support price for only 23 crops and a little over 6% of farmers were benefited.

He said many restrictions were imposed such as cap on maximum procurement per acre, need for prior registration and a village-based schedule and thus, very few were benefited. “Despite the annual rhetoric to procure every single grain, only around 30% millet was procured in Haryana,” quipped Mr. Yadav.

In reply to a question, he said the government had a long way to go before it could fulfil its promise to double the income of the farmers and demanded that the MSP be decided as per the “comprehensive cost formula” suggested by Swaminathan Commission.

On the government’s invitation to the Punjab farmers for talks on the three farm laws, Mr. Yadav opined that it “lacked sincerity”. He said that not much was expected to come out from the talks until the government was “willing to reconsider” the laws and politically empowered people were involved in the process.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/z46mw5/article32857183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL15-YADAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yadav-touring-haryana-to-review-crop-buying/article32857184.ece

A Class 12 student was apprehended on Wednesday in connection with an accident in north-west Delhi’s Model Town in which two sisters, aged four and seven, died and their minor brother and a 55-year-old family friend sustained injuries while crossing the road, the police said.

The 17-year-old boy, who studies at a private school here, was apprehended from his residence at DTC Colony in Model Town. His father is a businessman, they said. At his instance, the offending vehicle was recovered from a mechanic shop where the family had taken the car for repair work a day after the accident, the police said, adding that the vehicle was registered in the name of the accused’s uncle, who is based in Haryana.

Blood sample taken

The accident took place on Monday night near Gurdwara Nanak Piao on G.T. Road.

The police said further investigation into the matter is under way and blood samples of the apprehended minor has been collected to examine if he was under the influence of alcohol during the time of incident. The reports are awaited.

A case under Sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 304A (causing death by negligence) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered.

The death toll due to the virus has reached 5,898 with 44 more fatalities reported in a single day.

Of the total cases, 2,89,747 people have recovered and there are currently 21,903 active cases.

In the past 24 hours, 56,950 tests were conducted out of which 12,596 tests were RT-PCR — the highest in months. The High Court had directed the government to increase RT-PCR testing as Delhi was heavily dependent on rapid antigen tests, which is comparatively less accurate.

Out of the total 16,117 beds available for COVID-19 treatment in the city, 68.5% were vacant.

261,2020/10/15,Activists condemn chargesheet on Delhi riots,"Document mentions Mahila Ekta Yatra which took place in February

Several women activists on Wednesday condemned a police chargesheet on Delhi riots, where a “Mahila Ekta Yatra” which took place between February 14 and 16 finds a mention.

A statement issued by activists, including Annie Raja, Shabnam Hashmi, Anjali Bhardwaj and Kamla Bhasin, said that the yatra had been held to express solidarity with the women-led protests against the CAA, NRC and NPR.

“The chargesheet filed by Delhi Police assigns blame for the communal violence in north-east Delhi to protesters, activists and students, who were peacefully opposing the CAA, NRC and NPR. The chargesheet filed on September 2020 also mentions the Mahila Ekta Yatra. As organisers and participants [of yatra] we know that the allegations and insinuations against us are completely false and fabricated,” it read.

‘Suppressing opinion’

Further the statement added: “They are part of a persistent effort to suppress legitimate, peaceful expression of political opinion and opposition by criminalising it through preverse re-scripting of the truth and facts. The chargesheet invokes the draconian UAPA (Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act) to intimidate and silence dissenting voices and curtail personal liberty through long periods of incarceration.”

Activists Poonam Kaushik, Maimoona Mollah, Vani Subramanium, Amrita Johri and Suroor Mander are also among the signatories.

“At the protest sites we reaffirmed our commitment to a secular and inclusive India. To safeguard these values, we opposed the discriminatory CAA, the proposal to create an NRC through an NPR. We shall not be intimidated. We shall not be silenced. We demand that all steps be taken to ensure that the real perpetrators of the Delhi violence are brought to book and the persecution of peaceful dissenters is immediately stopped,” the statement said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/activists-condemn-chargesheet-on-delhi-riots/article32857175.ece
262,2020/10/15,Court reserves order on shifting M.J. Akbar case,"‘Trial vitiated if court has no jurisdiction’

A Delhi court on Wednesday remarked that the entire trial in the former Union Minister M.J. Akbar’s defamation case against journalist Priya Ramani for her tweets accusing him of sexual harassment could get vitiated if the magisterial court trying the case for about two years now did not have the jurisdiction.

Principal District and Sessions Judge Sujata Kohli made the observation while reserving the order on whether to transfer the criminal defamation complaint to another court.

The magisterial court trying the defamation case had on Tuesday sent the matter to the Principal District and Sessions Judge seeking its transfer to another court on the ground that his court was now designated to hear cases filed against lawmakers pursuant to a recent verdict of the Supreme Court.

Principal District and Sessions Judge Kohli, however, noted that the top court’s decision does not bar the judge concerned from hearing matters other than those against MPs and MLAs.

‘Entire trial over’

Senior advocate Geeta Luthra, appearing for Mr. Akbar, said that almost entire trial was over and only a few dates were remaining. The counsel appearing for Ms. Ramani said that the accused had no objection to any order passed by the court.

At the height of the MeToo movement in 2018, Ms. Ramani accused Mr. Akbar of sexual harassment during his previous role as newspaper editor. Following Ms. Ramani’s accusation, about dozen former colleagues of Mr. Akbar also came out with different allegations against him.

265,2020/10/15,"Over 1,200 municipal doctors to go on strike from October 19","Stir over pending salaries of doctors and staff to intensify over the coming days

Doctors and nurses of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Hindu Rao Hospital on Wednesday continued their protest over non-payment of salaries “for the last four months”. The stir is likely to spread and intensify as over 1,200 doctors working in other hospitals run by the North Corporation have given a notice for a strike from October 19 over the issue.

The Resident Doctors’ Associations (RDAs) of three North Corporation hospitals — Hindu Rao, Kasturba Gandhi and Rajan Babu TB — also issued a joint statement on Wednesday that salaries have not been paid for the past four months and they will continue to protest from a “common platform”.

Doctors from the other two hospitals are set to join the protest at Hindu Rao premises from Thursday.

“We have not been paid for the last four months and we have been protesting since October 5. Healthcare workers from other North Corporation hospitals also joined the protest at the Hindu Rao Hospital gate on Wednesday,” said Sagardeep Bawa, vice-president of the Hindu Rao Hospital RDA.

“I have borrowed money from my parents in the past four months. I don’t know how I will pay next month’s rent,” Dr. Bawa added.

The strike notice by the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association (MCDA), sent to the civic body commissioner, said they will go on “indefinite strike” from October 19 if their demands are not met, including release of pending salaries, arrears and pensions, and the transfer of hospitals, dispensaries and other healthcare facilities of the North Corporation to the Centre.

“This [non-payment of salaries] has happened multiple times with the North Corporation. Doctors had to resort to protest in 2016 as well,” said R.R. Gautam, president of the MCDA.

“The standard reply of the North Corporation is that the Delhi government is not releasing funds to them to pay salaries of employees. The Delhi government says that they have already released the funds,” he added.

Dr. Gautam said that emergency services at the six North Corporation hospitals will not be affected by the strike. He added that salaries of doctors and staff of all healthcare facilities of the corporation are pending since three-four months.

‘Transfer to Delhi govt.’

“The civic body had earlier tried transferring the hospitals to the Centre but they did not take them. We give funds to the civic body, but we are unaware of the expenditure since they do not get an audit done. A formal written proposal has been sent to the Centre to transfer these hospitals to the Delhi government,” Delhi Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lzfpwo/article32857118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE15HINDURAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/over-1200-municipal-doctors-to-go-on-strike-from-october-19/article32857119.ece
266,2020/10/15,State of selfless love,"Azhwars are believed to be incarnations of the Nityasuris in Vaikunta, and having been constantly in the Lord’s service they exemplify the highest form of bhakti yoga Nishta. They teach us how to practise this bhakti yoga, which is very demanding in terms of meditative competence and uninterrupted engagement with God, pointed out Aasuri Sri Madhavachariar in a discourse. A normal jivatma is drawn to bhakti when he is initiated to savour the auspicious qualities of the Almighty. But the jivatma is also under the laukika pressures of daily living and it requires tremendous effort to attain oneness with the Lord.

Moreover one has to contend with the pulls of the indriyas and in all spiritual literature, such as the hymns of the Azhwars and the Stotra granthas of acharyas, this is frequently stressed. It is very easy to get deceived by the senses and their wily ways and hence much effort is needed to gain control over them. The spirit of bhakti and involvement with God is best illustrated in the way of life of the Gopis for whom there is no thought except Krishna. They are not learned in the sastras, yet they have achieved the state of selfless love for Krishna that is explained as the essence of bhakti yoga. It is bhakti for bhakti’s sake about which the Lord speaks in glowing terms in the Gita.

It is also shown that Vasishta, Hanuman and rishis of yore are still engaged in bhakti yoga. It does not mean that Vasishta or Hanuman is not eligible for moksha. Vyasa says Vasishta has been ordained to accomplish certain things in this world and that his prarabdha binds him to bhakti yoga till date. So too, it is held that Hanuman, declining Rama’s offer of Vaikunta vasa, chooses to live in this world to meditate on Rama, chant Rama Nama, and listen to Ramayana.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/state-of-selfless-love/article32857988.ece
267,2020/10/15,Many areas in Hyderabad still in grip of darkness,"Distribution transformers in many localities still under water

Many localities, mostly in the southern and eastern parts of Hyderabad and its surrounding areas, continued to remain in darkness on Thursday, due to the delay in restoration of power supply, mainly as a measure of precaution since distribution installations such as distribution transformers and ring main unit (RMU) switches are in water-logged areas.

Authorities of power distribution utilities stated that although they had restored supply to all feeders, supply was still denied to some localities and premises that continue to remain water-logged. Distribution transformers in several localities in the city are still under water and that was the reason why there were yet to restore supply to such areas as a safety measure.

Besides, the RMU switch boxes in several water-logged areas still have moisture and in such a condition, supply could not be restored. “In areas such as Raj Bhavan Road, Hill Top Colony, NIMS, Jubilee Hills check-post, the RMUs were charged after removing moisture from them (normalising temperature inside them) to restore supply to the areas served,” an official of the Southern Discom said.

Power supply was also not restored to apartments whose cellars were water-logged as the internal supply units with meters and main switches still have moisture even after pumping out of water. However, power supply was normal in many parts as there was let up in rain on Thursday.

Meanwhile, only moderate rainfall in the range of 15.5 mm to 64.4 mm was recorded at several places in Adilabad, Kumuram Bheem, Nirmal, Jagitial, Hyderabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri, Rangareddy, Sangareddy, Mahabubnagar, Nagarkurnool, Khammam and Suryapet districts during the 24-hour period till 8.30 a.m. on Thursday.

Light rainfall up to 15.4 mm was recorded at many places across the State except Mulug, Mahabubabad and Warangal Rural districts.

A highest of 57.6 mm rain was recorded at Bejjur in Kumram Bheem and 53.1 mm in Gadihathnur in Adilabad districts during the period and at the remaining places, it was up to 38 mm only. According to the IMD forecast, light to moderate rainfall with thunder-showers at some places has being forecast for next three days.

The rains which pounded the State claimed its first casualty in the form of its heritage on Thursday morning. A large portion of Qila Shahpur in Jangaon district cracked and collapsed.

The Qila belonged to local legend Sardar Sarvai Paparayudu, a leader who lived in the early 18th century, who according to historian Bhangya Bhukya, Head of the Department of History, University of Hyderabad, was celebrated for his resistance to the Mughals after the decline of the Qutb Shahi dynasty.

Jangaon police and district administration confirmed the development to The Hindu. “The incident took place around 7.30 a.m. There are no casualties,” police said.

The district administration said that the debris from the fort came crashing down on three houses. Locals were shifted to safe places. A video clip of the collapse was captured on camera and shared widely on social media.

Department of Heritage Telangana was apprised of the situation.

A senior department official Narayana B. told The Hindu, “I am going to Jangaon now and will be able to tell the exact situation once I reach.”

In the recent past, the department had taken up conservation work at the fort and a CR wall was constructed. A ‘before’ and ‘after’ image of this conservation work is available on the website.

Tracing Sarvai Paparayudu’s history, Prof. Bhukya explained, “He was a local chief and bandit who resisted Mughul expansion in Telangana.

The skies cleared on Thursday after heavy rains battered the city, giving residents the much-needed relief. While water from many flood-hit colonies receded, distress calls from others continued to pour in.

According to data released by Telangana State Development Planning Society, automatic weather stations (AWS) in Rajendranagar received 41 mm rainfall in the last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, AWS in Hayatnagar recorded 40 mm, and Mehdipatnam witnessed 39 mm rainfall. L.B. Nagar, Kapra, and Goshamahal received the lowest rainfall in the last 24 hours.

Hyderabad City Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar on Thursday pointed out the hardship faced by those living on the south of Musi river, which comprises large parts of the Old City.

He tweeted, “South zone too suffered a lot from the fury of heavy rains. Every PS of SZ remained alert from the first hour. Along with me many senior officers personally supervised the rescue operations. We had to call Army at Al Jubail Colony for operations. Community had faith and it helped.”

After the deluge, and the subsequent receding of waters, areas such as Chaderghat, Moosanagar and Shankar Nagar, a low-lying area where several houses were submerged in the Musi flood, were dealing with muck washed up to their streets and houses.

After respite for several hours on Wednesday, the rains pounded the city briefly at night. The Gurram Cheruvu in Balapur area began to overflow. Public representatives attempted to contain the water by stacking sand bags. Meanwhile, WhatsApp chat groups began coordinating relief work. Users shared information such as the need for volunteering and relief in flood-hit areas. Others began amplifying their messages.

Locals, and volunteers of non-government organisations continued to deliver cooked food and dry ration packs to those in need, including the displaced. Till late on Wednesday night, pleas for help came from Uppal, Al Jubail Colony, Nadeem Colony, and Hashamabad. Some parts of these neighbourhoods continued to grapple with flooding as waters had not fully receded.

Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials along with elected public representatives Asaduddin Owaisi and others took stock of the situation and visited Nadeem Colony, among other places.

Mr Owaisi pointed out that there was a breach in Palle Cheruvu and that the authorities have been alerted.

The body of postman J. Sunder Raj, who had left his office for delivering posts on Tuesday, was found in Nagole lake by police on Thursday morning. He may have been swept away in a flooding nala, police said. Sunder Raj worked in GSI Bandlguda post office.

On Wednesday, his superior Arram Sreeramulu, Sub-Postmaster GSI Bandlaguda, approached the L.B. Nagar police stating that Sunder Raj neither reported for duty on Wednesday nor returned home.

“It has been a harrowing experience for us at the Academy in the last 24 hours. We had water seeping into the Academy, submerging almost everything, including ranges, equipment and machines,” Gagan said.

“More than the money, all the hard work of nine years has gone down the drain,” he said.

“Well, if it was the pandemic that led to the closure of the Academy for close to seven months, now it is the rains that poured water on all our plans for resumption of activity in a big way,” Gagan said.

“It is really disgusting that we face this kind of scenario even as we were switching gears to unveil plans to produce champions after the restrictions imposed because of the pandemic were eased considerably,” the former World Cup gold medallist said.

“It is never easy to get a world class venue like this. And, what hurts me most is that this is a very dear venue to me as I have great personal memories here,” said a sombre Gagan.

275,2020/10/15,Hyderabad registers second highest rainfall the city has ever received in 24 hours,"Hyderabad recorded highest rainfall of 24.15 cm on Aug. 24, 2000: met officials

Claims making rounds about Wednesday’s rainfall being the highest ever in the recorded history of Hyderabad climate may not be true. However, it is certainly the second highest in 24 hours’ duration, assert experts from the Meteorological Centre, Hyderabad.

India Meteorological Department’s weather monitoring station in Begumpet has recorded rainfall of 19.2 cm during the 24 hours starting 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday. This, when compared to data of all previous years since 1891, proves to be the highest ever rainfall in the month of October, and also the second highest on any day in any month.

It also exceeds the figure of the legendary deluge in 1908, when 15.3 cm was recorded on a single day on September 27.

The highest recorded rainfall so far in Hyderabad as per the IMD records is 24.15 cm on August 24, 2000, as per data from the Begumpet weather station. Several localities in the GHMC’s purview on Wednesday, recorded more than the IMD’s highest, with Hayatnagar clocking over 29 cm in less than 24 hours. However, Met department officials say that the data was from the automatic weather monitoring stations installed by the Telangana State Development Planning Society, and not comparable with the IMD station at Begumpet.

They were illegally manufacturing pan masala in the name of Manikchand, a Pune-based multi-crore industry, Shamshabad DCP N Prakash Reddy said.

Based on a complaint lodged by a city-based businessman A.V Suresh Kumar, a case was registered at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport police station.

The police raided Golden Fingers Food products, Gaganpahad, and seized pan masala, raw material and machinery worth ₹1.25 crore.

The actor's father is the owner of Goa Panmasala.

""The father-son duo who are operating the business across the country are using the trademark of Manikchand illegally,"" Mr. Reddy said, quoting the complaint copy.

Their factory in Gangapahad was raided and the stock and other materials were seized for violating trademark of '7 hills Manikchand' by manufacturing and selling pan masala under brand without requisite trademark.

Earlier this week, Sachin Joshi was detained by officials of the Bureau of Immigration at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai, in connection with a case of gutka seizure registered at Bahadurpura police in Hyderabad Commissionerate in March.

277,2020/10/15,"Unprecedented floods too couldn’t move KCR, alleges Uttam","‘Failure of the government in managing the civic infrastructure’

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has found fault with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for not visiting the flood-affected areas and said it only shows his insensitivity towards people’s problems.

“While the entire city is flooded with unprecedented rains, and people suffering, the Chief Minister reviewed the Horticulture Department activities as if it was more important than the lives of lakhs of people suffering in the floods,” he said.

He said Mr. Rao is like Roman emperor Nero who played the fiddle while Rome was burning, and demanded that he visit flood-hit areas of Hyderabad and take immediate measures to help the affected families.

He was speaking to reporters after visiting B.S. Makhta and other flood-hit areas of Khairatabad constituency on Thursday.

He alleged that the devastation caused due to floods was not only due to unprecedented rainfall, but was also primarily due to the failure of the government in managing the civic infrastructure.

“Minister K.T. Rama Rao's claim of government spending ₹67,000 crore on Hyderabad's development in the last six years is ridiculous. Nothing has been done to repair, maintain or upgrade the storm water drains. The Monsoon Action Plan has just remained on paper,” he said.

The TPCC chief claimed that more than 100 people were killed due to rain-related incidents across Telangana in the last two days. However, he alleged that the State government is hiding the real figures of deaths as it did with deaths due to COVID-19.

Earlier, Mr. Reddy and other Congress leaders interacted with the affected people and also distributed relief. He assured them that that he would pressurise the government for quick relief measures.

283,2020/10/15,Dreams and hopes of a young mother crushed under a wall,"Eight persons were killed after a wall of a farmhouse collapsed on their houses

Notwithstanding the gloomy pandemic times, Fouzia Naaz’s life was filled with joy last month when she became a mother for the second time. Barely 20 days later, however, tragedy struck — the boundary wall of a farmhouse in Ghouse Nagar collapsed due to incessant rain and the debris consisting of large granite blocks came crashing on Naaz’s house, killing her and her infant son, Zohaib.

Her older son, Syed Zain (3), was also killed instantaneously. As did Mohammed Samad (35) and his wife Saba Hashmi (26), also inmates of the same house, and related to Ms Naaz.

The residents of the house next door met the same tragic fate. Zakira Begum (50) and her grandchildren Syeda Anwari (4) and Syed Sadiq (16 months old) were killed. The boundary wall debris spared Begum’s son Siddiq.

The complainant of the case, Mohammed Jahangir Hussain (25), brother of Mr. Samad, told police that around 8 p.m. on Tuesday he heard a rumble, followed by cries of despair from the two houses. He rushed to the scene and witnessed the horror.

Mr Hussain lived with his father, Mohammed Jahangir, two brothers, and four sisters in the ill-fated house.

Two persons were injured and rushed to the Owaisi Hospital. One of the victims suffered serious pelvic injuries, said a doctor treating them.

Meanwhile, Chandrayangutta legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi reached the hospital and interacted with the patients and their families.

285,2020/10/15,Dealing with deluge after the downpour,"Water gushes into cellars at many places

Twelve hours after the heavy rain receded, water continued to flow with strength on the arterial roads and bylanes in and around Chandanagar on Wednesday evening. While people had expected to wake up to an unprecedented situation, none could have estimated how terrifying it would be.

Years of monetary investment were drowned as shops located in cellars alongside Chandanagar main road continued to be submerged. People were seen trying to pump the water out onto roads.

A little ahead, ankle-level water flowed consistently, covering one side of the main road. With no tar in sight, people slowed down their high horse powered vehicles and joined an unofficial queue of vehicles alongside median lest they get caught up in potholes.

A similar situation was witnessed on Madinaguda main road and its bylanes where mucky water continued to flow. In some more places, debris and uprooted plants were strewn on road. Towing vehicles were busy pulling out cars from under thick layers of mud and swirling waters. Vehicle mechanics, too, had their hands full. TS Disaster Response and Fire Services personnel who were busy pumping out water from an apartment’s cellar in Madinaguda said it was easily more than five hours’ job.

“This cellar is spread on around 300 square yards land, and is 10 feet deep. We have been on the job since noon and hope to pump out all the water by 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. We have four more cellars to empty,” said S. Rajeshwar, driver and operator.

286,2020/10/15,"Saroornagar lake submerges many localities, residents scurry for cover","Surplus water from lake exceeded the capacity of drain carrying it to Musi river

Santhoshi Gaikwad from Singareni Colony woke up at 3 a.m. to an unusual sight. What she thought was rain water gushed into her home. With the water levels rising, she sensed the urgent need to vacate the home. Her family had to first haul the 81-year-old mother-in-law over a shed in the neighbour’s house, before the rest of them clambered up too.

What she later learnt left her totally shocked. It was not rain water, but the Saroornagar lake that paid a visit to her home in the dead of the night. “We never experienced anything like this since 1992, when we started living here. It was horrific, to say the least. I saw my neighbour, an octogenarian gentleman, holding his sick wife aloft in both hands to save her from drowning, but we could not reach out to him,” she recalled in the morning after finding shelter in one of the apartment complexes in the area.

Gopal Reddy, secretary of the adjoining Saraswathi Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, chimed in to say that never was such a deluge seen for the past 40 to 50 years at least.

Extensive damage

The damage, however, was not limited to Singareni Colony and Saraswathi Nagar, which fell in the full tank level of the lake’s original spread, as per officials. Surplus water from the lake exceeded the capacity of the drain carrying it to Musi river via P&T Colony, V.V.Nagar, and Hanuman Nagar. Breach in the drain led to inundation of colonies such as Green Park colony, Seesala Basthi and Kondandram Nagar, where the roads were converted into whirling streams.

From there, the water found its natural course to the Musi, submerging several areas up to 4-5 kilometres, besides flooding Vijayawada highway near Chaitanyapuri. Officials had to break the Metro Rail divider to let the water pass on to the other side, inundating the roads in Hanuman Nagar and surrounding areas. All the homes en route lay besieged, with no supplies nor help arriving till late in the day.

Nala’s capacity

“The nala’s carrying capacity should have been kept in mind before dumping water from everywhere in the tank. Rain water from surrounding areas such as Santhosh Nagar, B.N.Reddy Nagar, Vanasthalipuram, and Bairamalguda is being diverted here,” complained G.Kishan, a resident of Kodandram Nagar.

His claim is partially true, officials admit, as a newly constructed stormwater drain brought the water from Meerpet and Jillelaguda areas up to a spot in Karmanghat and left it there.

GHMC was to pick it up from there to link it to Saroornagar lake, before which the torrential downpour worsened the situation. All the water from the two areas found its natural course to the lake nevertheless, causing the deluge.

While the stormwater drains are laid with alacrity, authorities have ignored the need to enhance the volume of surplus canals, rue the residents.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/1ftaml/article32857529.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14-SAROORNAGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/saroornagar-lake-submerges-many-localities-residents-scurry-for-cover/article32857515.ece

The once-in-a-generation rainfall turned Hyderabad citizens into disaster tourists. People risked their life and limb to watch the Musi river touch both the banks, the destruction at Gaganpahad and swirling waters of lakes near Jalapalli.

“The road is straight but the water has chipped away a portion. I am asking people not to go there but they are not listening,” said Narasimha of Laxmiguda village as throngs of people walked across the overflowing waters from the Yerrakunta lake, which is part of a system that includes Madikunta, Jalapalli and Palle Cheruvu.

Family outing

“I have come from Kattedan to watch this,” said Shankar, a battery technician who brought his wife and two kids on the bike to see the muddy water swirl beside the road near Umda Sagar Lake. But a majority of visitors and people trying to catch fish were from VAMBAY colony in the area.

The rush to see the Musi river in spate created trouble for police in the Attapur area as the freshly-laid asphalt road between Langar Houz and Attapur showed some cracks and displacement of earthen work. The road is a reclamation project on the Musi. A large number of people turned up at the Tipu Khan Bridge, Bapu Ghat bridge and other bridges and vantage points to see the sweep of the river flow. The teeming mass of rubbernecks led to traffic blockages at multiple places.

At Gaganpahad, people clambered up the unfinished flyover to see the destruction wrought by the water right from the Old Kurnool Highway down the path where the water scattered cars, containers and the road which was twisted out of shape. “This is a main road and people from surrounding areas are coming to see this. The main road is anyway blocked for regular traffic,” said a police official who was seen trying to shoo away the visitors.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/citizens-lust-for-adventure-during-a-disaster/article32857498.ece

289,2020/10/15,"Rain fury leaves capital battered, bruised","Drowning colonies, waterlogged roads and overflowing drains defined Hyderabad on a heavy-rain Tuesday

Unrelenting downpour throughout the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday pounded the city of Hyderabad to pulp, leaving its roads flooded, colonies drowned, drains overflowing and citizens dazed.

People from several localities woke up to the sight of rain water surrounding their homes, while thousands had no luxury of sleep at all with water entering their homes in the night.

Lakes overflowed claiming their full tank levels, and in the bargain, drowning all encroachments that obstructed their flow. Hundreds of colonies in Saroornagar, Ramantapur, Bandlaguda, Uppal, Tolichowki, Falaknuma, Kukatpally, Nizampet, ECIL and other areas were inundated. With water reaching up to six to seven feet depth, the first floors were vacated, and people waited desperately for help on terraces and top floors.

Water submerged homes in localities such as Nadeem Colony in Tolichowki and Hariharapuram in B.N.Reddy Nagar, necessitating boats to evacuate people.

Reservoir gates lifted

With the flood gates of Himayatsagar lifted at midnight, Musi river flowed full stream, thereby inundating localities such as Moosa Nagar, Shankar Nagar, Kamala Nagar, and Vinayak Veedhi.

Residents, who stayed back despite alerts for the past three days, had to climb up on to the terrace for safety, where they awaited help for long.

The river flowed over the causeway bridges at Chaderghat and Moosarambagh, both of which were shut to traffic by police. At Moosarambagh, the iron barricades to the river were washed away in the flood.

With flood water from Saroornagar lake blocking all the roads on one side, and the Malakpet road under-bridge inundated with storm water on the other, several areas in Dilsukhnagar and surrounding areas were besieged on all sides, and commuters faced several untold hardships.

Nalas/stormwater drains overflowing everywhere posed grave danger. Especially threatening was Murki Nala, which streamed menacingly through the strees of Al Jubail Colony, in Ghazi-e-Millat, Nimra Colony and Al Saroor Colony in Falaknuma area. Drains in Dabeerpura, and Yakutpura too were found overflowing.

Surplus water from Hussainsagar entered homes in areas such as Padma Nagar, Nagamaiah Kunta, Arundhathi Nagar, Sabarmati Colony, Ashok Nagar and Adikmet.

As per data from automatic weather stations installed across the city, Singapore Township in Pocharam received the maximum rainfall at over 32 cm, with all localities in city receiving over 20 cm in one night.

Building collapse

Several building collapse and tree fall incidents were reported from across the city, along with tedious power cuts ranging from 12 hours to 24 hours.

Corporators and public representatives were on the roads since morning, monitoring the situation. Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao arrived at the GHMC headquarters and reviewed the situation through a teleconference with Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and Collectors of Medchal, Rangareddy and Hyderabad districts. He asked officials to be on the field and oversee the relief measures. He asked officials to shift the homeless to night shelters, and prevent accidents due to cellar digging.

He appealed to citizens not to venture out for the coming two days, as more rains are expected.

Park wall collapses

A portion of the Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park boundary wall collapsed here on Wednesday on account of the rains which wreaked havoc in the city.

According to officials, 64 metres of the wall collapsed. Damage to walking track and pathways has also been reported. Officials swung into action and built a structure which they said would serve as temporary protection. Officials clarified that the park would be open for walkers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/uietd4/article32857473.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy14Rain-impactcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rain-fury-leaves-capital-battered-bruised/article32857450.ece
290,2020/10/15,"Wall of water swept away everything, says eyewitness","‘Only three are said to be dead but we saw many people being carried away by the waters’

A wall of water with a roaring sound is how Shivshankar Singh remembers the beginning of destruction around him. The worker at Indian Oil petrol station was chatting with his colleagues as the rain continued to beat down on Tuesday night.

“Around 1.15 a.m., there was a big sound and even before we could realise it, there was water everywhere. Vehicles moving on the road got swept away. You can see one of them,” says Mr. Singh pointing to a SUV perched on the side on the road.

Elsewhere on the road in Gaganpahad area, there were signs of destruction as if some giant had tossed around vehicles and uprooted electric supply lines.

A pre-fabricated toilet was tossed yards away from where it was installed by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation officials. A few cars and container trucks could be seen nearly 50 metres from the road crushed, crumpled and covered with sand and debris.

Large scale devastation

While one stream of water roared down the Old Kurnool Highway and swept through the gap in the under construction flyover, another stream swirled around the Celebration Convention function hall and slammed the wall of the flyover. The water swept away a house where three bodies have been fished out and one boy is still missing. “Many vehicles got washed away. Though they are saying only three persons are dead, we saw other people being carried away by the waters,” says Mallesh, another employee of the petroleum outlet pointing to a waist-high mark reached by the flood.

“It will take time to restore traffic on this road. Right now we are focussing on rescue effort,” said a police official.

Kin recounts horror

Four persons, including a four-year-old boy, were swept away in the rains in Gaganpahad area, which comes under RGIA Police Station limits, late on Tuesday night.

The house was built on a small plot of land near a function hall.

“I was in the godown when the house was swept away. Tanima and Amer are siblings, and their bodies have been recovered along with Tahir, who is my nephew. Eight-year-old Ayan is still missing,” said Muhammad Imran sitting near a shop beside AH43 that connects Hyderabad to Bengaluru.

Imran pointed to a clump of wet bushes to show where the temporary house used to exist. “The water from a nearby lake overflowed and swirled over the wall sweeping away the house and its inhabitants,” said a police official on the site.

The function hall and a row of shops were saved from the damage as the water rose nearly 15 feet from the ground and swirled around it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9c195s/article32857426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14-SWEPTHEAVYRAINS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/wall-of-water-swept-away-everything-says-eyewitness/article32857410.ece
291,2020/10/15,Telangana High Court declines to interfere in civil administration,"‘Government announced red alert in advance about the rains’

Telangana High Court on Wednesday declined to take up hearing of the public grievances following heavy rains in the State.

When lawyer Ch. Naresh requested the court to suo moto take up the issue of difficulties being faced by people of twin cities due to havoc created by rains, the High Court said it cannot do so. The lawyer also said that some people also lost their lives in the mayhem caused by incessant rains.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, responding to the lawyer’s request, said the government had announced red alert in advance about the rains. Officials came onto the roads and were involved in the work of rescuing people, the bench said.

Under such challenging situations, courts cannot interfere in civil administration, the bench observed. If there were any omissions or commissions on the part of the government in dealing with the situation, the citizens can approach the court eventually, the bench said.

Green Pharma city

Meanwhile, Justice A. Abhishek Reddy directed the State government to keep in abeyance distribution of compensation to people who lost their lands for Green Pharma City. The judge also directed the petitioners to include Bhoodan Yajna Board as respondents in the writ petition while posting the hearing of the plea to October 20.

Five women moved the High Court stating that persons who had no lands in Tadiparthy village of Yacharam mandal in Ranga Reddy were included among the beneficiaries of the compensation. They alleged that persons without any rights were claiming compensation for lands acquired for Green Pharma City.

In a separate statement, the HC declared holiday on Thursday in the backdrop of heavy rains in the State.

293,2020/10/15,KTR pays quick visit to flood-hit areas,"Assures to address local issues immediately, holds meeting with GHMC officials

Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao made a whirlwind tour of flood-hit areas in the city on Wednesday to assess the damage and assure people of possible help. He directed officials accompanying him to address the issues raised by people soon.

He was busy since morning reviewing the situation and the government’s assistance and later visited several colonies that were flooded where people spent a sleepless night on Tuesday.

Accompanied by Home Minister Mahmood Ali, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, DGP M. Mahender Reddy, GHMC Commissioner Lokesh Kumar and many others, he visited colonies in Bairamalguda at L.B. Nagar that were flooded and interacted with locals.

Locals complained of little assistance from officials, despite the local tank breaching and flooding the colonies. As some youngsters tried to bring the issues to the notice of KTR, they were dragged away by his security men. They alleged that police took them away and beat them up mercilessly for trying to reach out to the Minister. Their grouse was against L.B. Nagar MLA D. Sudheer Reddy and they alleged that he has never visited the colony.

Mr. KTR asked the MLA and the corporator concerned to assist them. Later, the team visited the colonies in Ramanthapur and Habsiguda hit by the flood water from the overflowing Ramanthapur lake.

Seeing the water-logged houses and inundated colonies, he gave several suggestions to Uppal MLA Subhash Reddy and other officials on mitigating the problems related to the lake.

He then visited Azampura, Teegalguda, Moosarambagh and Shankar Nagar in Malakpet accompanied by local MLA Ahmed Balala. He said that the government was ensuring food, bedsheets and medicines for people in inundated areas. The Minister cautioned people that the rains were likely to continue for a couple of days and they should move to the rescue shelters of the GHMC.

Later, he toured Chandrayangutta, Santosh Nagar and Falaknuma, where he was joined by Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and other MLAs. He inspected the road at Aramghar that got washed away, and asked officials to repair the road immediately.

He held a teleconference and instructed GHMC officers to vacate dilapidated buildings. According to officials, as many as 19 dilapidated structures were demolished at Charminar, Falaknuma, Lal Darwaza, Santoshnagar, and Champapet. People were evacuated from 14 houses at Jummerat Bazaar, Afzal Sagar, Chintal Basthi and other neighbourhoods. At least 35 people living along the Musi in Mangalhat area were evacuated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kbtp2m/article32857246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy14KTR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ktr-pays-quick-visit-to-flood-hit-areas/article32857243.ece

With several people being displaced on account of the rains that pounded the city, a mosque in Toli Chowki has thrown open its doors to those who need shelter.

The management of the mosque, Masjid-e-Tawheed, Ahle Hadees, told The Hindu that ample space is available to accommodate people from all faiths.

Religion no bar

“Irrespective of gender and religion, we are welcoming people into the masjid. We have even offered to help displaced people with transport. While a number of people were already here, we got a call from some others who were affected and are expecting them here shortly,” said Mohammed Imaad, a member of the mosque managing committee.

The MS Education Academy, which runs a chain of schools and colleges across the city, has also welcomed displaced people.

“Our branches in Musheerabad, Malakpet, Toli Chowki, Charminar and other places, are open for people of all faiths who need shelter. We have several rooms and families can stay here,” Mohammed Lateef Khan, Chairman, MS Education Academy, said.

Volunteers help

295,2020/10/15,Saidabad police rescue man from jaws of death,"Car stuck behind a tree, he was rescued within 30 minutes

He was just clueless. Sitting in his car that got stuck behind a tree after being washed away in gushing water, M. Ravindra realised he was in the jaws of death.

Slowly, the 51-year-old private employee mustered courage and dialled 100. After a risky operation of nearly two hours, Saidabad police finally brought him out safely on Tuesday night.

“I was seriously worried of my fate as the car first got washed away in the water only to get stuck behind a tree. Every time the vehicle shook in the water, I felt like moving closer to death,” Mr. Ravindra recalled on Wednesday speaking with The Hindu over phone.

Around 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday, he dropped his friend in Reddy Colony of Champapet. Clouds were already bursting by then. He thought it was just another downpour the city has been witnessing of late.

The massive rain started inundating roads of the colony. Ravindra hoped he can manage to drive up to the main road. But the oncoming water stream began becoming bigger and bigger within seconds.

He pressed the accelerator but realised the gushing water was more powerful as it pushed back his vehicle. Within seconds, the car began to move back pushed by the swirling water.

After a couple of hundred yards, the car got stuck to a tree. “It was pitch dark. Water was more than two feet high. If I step out, I would have been washed away,” Ravindra recalled. He dialed 100 and informed his situation. Asking him to stay put inside the car, the call receiver alerted Saidabad police who rushed to the area. “It took us 30 minutes to trace him because it was water all around and dark,” Saidabad Inspector said. The police party could see him stuck in the car from a distance at Chinthal area.

Police too could not venture into the swirling and speeding water. “So we threw a rope at Ravindra who managed to step out and catch it,” Mr. Srinivas explained. As suggested by policemen, he scaled onto the car’s bonnet before tying the rope around his waist. Slowly, he entered into the water and was pulled out to safety by the police team asking him to be cautious with every step. “But for police, I would not have been alive. Kudos to them,” he said choking.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/pjapnm/article32857224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy14Saidabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/saidabad-police-rescue-man-from-jaws-of-death/article32857211.ece

With different commuting modes operating side by side, Kochi is set to emerge as the first Indian city having seamless inter-modal connectivity, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. He was speaking after inaugurating online the pair of two-lane bridges at Champakkara on the Vyttila-Pettah route, on Thursday.

“Kochi metro, which is a lifeline and a modern commuting mode, plays a major role in this. It ushered in fast, clean, comfortable and reliable commuting in the city. Its impending extension to Kakkanad will change the face of the port city. KMRL’s second initiative, the Water Metro, is set to begin operating in January. It will tremendously benefit islanders and others living on the banks of Vembanad backwaters,” he said.

Pedestrianisation

The Chief Minister said that non-motorised transport and pedestrianisation too had been emphasised along the metro corridor. Steps had also been taken to ensure last-mile connectivity for commuters. In addition, buses and autorickshaws were fast shifting to CNG as a low-emission fuel source. KMRL was spearheading the task to clean and revive once-navigable canals in the city, under the ₹1,400-crore Integrated Urban Regeneration and Water Transport System, Mr. Vijayan said.

In what signals the likely postponement of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, due to open in December this year, the Kochi Biennale Foundation has informed that the Students’ Biennale, an educational initiative of KMB, will be held online from February 21 next year.

The Students’ Biennale, a major segment of KMB which buttresses fine arts education by curating and featuring works by students from across the country, will be held online this time around, thanks to COVID-19. Over 1,000 students have participated in Students’ Biennale exhibition and programmes since its inception in 2014.

Production grant

All components of the Students’ Biennale, including workshops and exhibition forums, will be online. A curatorial team of five, Adip Dutta, Archana Hande, Manoj Vyloor, Suresh K. Nair and Vasudha Thozhur, will select the works to be featured in the Students’ Biennale. Selected projects will receive production grants and be exhibited in an online exhibition which will not be limited to art works but is open to practices as well.

Students of BFA/MFA or equivalent courses in India who are desirous of presenting their works may send applications before November 15. More details can be had on the Students’ Biennale website. Queries may be addressed to studentsbiennale@kochimuzirisbiennale.org.

A communication in this regard said that everything, from the communication between curators and students and the work towards the display process, will be online. “The curatorial team will do their best to engage with students across the digital divide working with accessible interfaces. Students will also receive technical and documentation inputs to work with the digital medium,” the note said.

Besides the exhibition, a parallel programme of workshops will be held for participants as well as other students.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/students-biennale-to-be-held-online-in-feb-next-year/article32864803.ece
299,2020/10/15,One more youngster arrested in drug case,"More than seven months after arresting two college students on the charge of possessing 21 grams of MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) from a rented room at Edappally, the city police on Thursday arrested another youngster allegedly for whom the drug was smuggled in from Bengaluru.

The arrested was identified as Muhammed Shifas, 20, of Aluva. According to the police, he had allegedly paid for the drug, which was reportedly brought from a Nigerian in Bengaluru for ₹40,000. The Nigerian had since been arrested.

Ahammad Yasin and Muhammad Shahad, youngsters from Aluva, were picked up in a police raid on the evening of March 2. During their custodial interrogation, the duo allegedly confessed to have bought the drug for Shifas for which they had gone to Bengaluru on a rented car on February 27.

There they met their friend Muhammed Riyas, also from Aluva, who was a student there and stayed in his room. Shifas then transferred the money online to Shahad’s account who in turn transferred it to the account of Riyas’s room-mate.

Later, they withdrew the money using the latter’s ATM card and bought the drugs before returning to the city where they were arrested a couple of days later. Riyas surrendered before the court on October 7. It was his custodial interrogation that led to the arrest of the Nigerian.

The police said that Shifas and the group had taken a room on rent adjoining the building from where the duo was arrested. But Shifas went into hiding as soon the initial arrests were made. More arrests were likely in the case, the police said.

District Police Chief (Kochi City) Vijay Sakhare had formed a team under Thrikkakara Assistant Commissioner K.M. Gigimon to probe the case. A team led by Inspector A.

300,2020/10/15,Saving city’s strays at night,"Campaign to fit dogs with reflective collars gains popularity

A stray dog rifling across a road in the dead of the night startling motorists and leaving either or both of them grievously injured or even dead has not been rare on the city roads.

The death of two strays and injury to another in similar incidents in her neighbourhood at Marine Drive during the lockdown prompted a Mumbai-based entrepreneur temporarily settled here to kick-start a campaign to put reflective collars on strays.

The Instagram-based campaign, CollarUpCochin, has since then become popular among animal lovers and communities feeding stray dogs. “It is actually an initiative to support a project called Silver Lining being run by a Delhi-based 15-year-old boy named Samarth Sarin whereby reflective collars are put on stray dogs, making them visible during nights. I buy these nylon ribbon-like collars with a clip and stretchable buckle from him at ₹20 a piece,” said Radhika Wakharkar, who also runs an animal welfare NGO in Goa.

So far, she has distributed 600 collars, thanks to the donations of her friends and supporters while another 700 are being awaited. Ms. Wakharkar has committed to donating 100 such collars a month to Animal Birth Control for Dogs (ABCD) programme of the Kochi Corporation since it undertakes many monthly surgeries.

“We sedate the animals for undertaking surgeries and therefore it is easier to put it on them. The collar is comfortable on the skin and is very effective at nights. But since strays are not accustomed to such alien objects, we found many of them to have shaken it off before long,” said Sonika Sathish, veterinary surgeon, ABCD.

Ashwini Prem, who runs an NGO, Oneness, is actively collaborating with the campaign and hopes that the collars would bring about a positive change in the attitude of people towards strays and create the impression that there are people who care for them.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/56e7gz/article32857878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-KI-STRAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/saving-citys-strays-at-night/article32857879.ece
301,2020/10/15,Open spaces in city to come under CCTV blanket,"₹42-crore project to cover walkways, parks and other key locales

Come February, most public spaces under the Kochi Corporation will be covered by a surveillance blanket provided by 465 closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed at 125 locales as part of the Integrated City Surveillance System (ICSS) of Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML).

They will cover walkways, parks, junctions and other key locales. The ₹42-crore cloud-based video surveillance system project, work on which is under way, will have video-analytical capabilities like detection of littering on streets, vehicle licence plates and no-helmet recognition, detection of intruders and those who vandalise public properties. This would lessen the burden on the police and the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), which would be able to keep tabs on criminals and rule violators from the confines of the integrated city command and control centre (IC4), CSML sources said. This will be a game changer in law enforcement, becoming a deterrent for rule violators and a reassurance to citizens, since it is expected to prevent and reduce crimes in the city.

The system, being readied by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), will also come in handy to assist emergency services.

BEL will also be vested with its upkeep for three years.

On the blink

At present, most CCTVs along arterial roads and other public spaces in the city, installed by the police and the Motor Vehicles Department, are defunct. The malfunctioning cameras will be replaced with modern ones and integrated with the project. The 125 areas where the cameras will be installed were decided in tandem with the police, the sources added.

The data collected will be primarily used by the police and the MVD, to bring to book miscreants and rule violators. On its part, it will help the Kochi Corporation to report offences related to littering and illegal dumping of waste.

Traffic discipline

The cameras will be capable of zooming into a person’s face, aiding his detection. The data thus gathered will be used by the police to identify the person.

Apart from ensuring safety and security of members of the public, the system will help garner evidence that will come in handy before courts for criminal and civil cases. It is also expected to help improve traffic discipline and in managing large-scale events.

In addition, emergency call boxes and public address systems will be installed at 50 and 20 locations respectively. They too would be linked to the command and control centre, the sources added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/nw8rjq/article32857860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15-KI-SUREVEILLANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/open-spaces-in-city-to-come-under-cctv-blanket/article32857861.ece
302,2020/10/15,"AI, Data Science turn most popular courses at MGU","Experts to assess academic and infrastructural capabilities of affiliated colleges

The growing demand for professionals in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science has reflected in the new-generation interdisciplinary programmes proposed by government and aided colleges under Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU) for the academic year 2020-21.

The university had invited applications from higher educational institutions based on the government directive that such courses could be launched from November 1. The Higher Education Department had asked universities to initiate steps to launch new undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in innovative areas. They included four- and five-year programmes recommended by an expert committee set up by the government.

The integrated M.Sc programme in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) figured top among the innovative programmes proposed by the affiliated colleges. The postgraduate programme in Data Analytics and the integrated M.Sc course in Basic Science were the other courses that caught the attention of the colleges.

Among the integrated M.Sc programmes in Basic Sciences, the managements mainly opted for courses in Statistics, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. The postgraduate programme in Statistics had considerable demand, mostly buoyed by the demand for skilled professionals in fields like banking, analytics, finance, and software development.

The colleges also opted for B.Sc in Psychology and Behavioural Sciences. The postgraduate courses proposed in interdisciplinary areas included MA in Archaeology and Material Cultural Studies, Space Science, and Economics.

Among the undergraduate programmes in humanities, the colleges opted for BA in Econometrics, BA in Foreign Languages (English, French, German), and Bachelor in Sports Management. More than 100 innovative programmes were available for the colleges to choose from for the new academic year. The university has appointed an expert member and a representative of the Syndicate to assess the academic and infrastructural capabilities of the colleges that had applied for the courses. An expert committee headed by MGU Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas had recommended the formation of a State-wide monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the new programmes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/e88h1t/article32857827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tvki-coursescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ai-data-science-turn-most-popular-courses-at-mgu/article32857828.ece
303,2020/10/15,Job-oriented programmes losing sheen,"Lack of qualified faculty members, infrastructure to blame

Lack of qualified faculty members and adequate infrastructure has taken the sheen off ‘job-oriented’ self-financing programmes sanctioned by Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU) earlier.

The demand for most of these tailor-made courses has declined, according to the varsity authorities, owing to shortcomings in academic and infrastructural requirements.

The expert committee appointed by the government for proposing innovative courses had mentioned in its report that the existing new-generation programmes like B.Sc Microbiology, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Hotel Management, and Bachelor of Tourism Studies and Management were mostly offered in the self-financing sector.

Employment

Since job opportunities for these programmes as projected initially have not been the same when it comes to reality, the demand came down to near zero in many colleges, and some courses have been wound up for want of applicants.

The failure of the proliferation of specialised courses like those in biotechnology remains a point to be noted while recommending new programmes, the committee had said. It found that many of the ‘skill-oriented’ programmes had failed to meet the expectations of job providers.

Hence, a majority of students who cleared such courses could not find a job. One of the reasons behind it is the lack of consultation with the industry and non-consideration of requirements of job providers, which affected the quality of education offered, it said.

Teachers in various social science disciplines had cited the inadequacy of the curriculum followed in many universities in Kerala to understand the most recent developments in the discipline as a major lacuna in achieving the desired results.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/job-oriented-programmes-losing-sheen/article32857816.ece
304,2020/10/15,Turning fish vending into a vibrant experience,"Fishermen take to social media to reach out to potential markets

After more than four decades fighting the vagaries of the ocean, Ummar, a 58 year-old fisherman from Edavanakkad, is now realising the significance of technology to his trade.

With the pandemic wrecking havoc on the functioning of harbours and markets too often, youngsters like his son Mujeeb Ummar has turned to the social media to reach out to potential markets.

The largely WhatsApp-based initiative, now four months old, that has turned fish vending into a cultural experience of sorts for buyers is increasingly turning popular.

Rather than restricting his posts to different kinds of fishes and their prices, Mujeeb, instead, broadcasts alerts about impending arrival of boats, followed by videos of their arrival and the separation of catch from the nets through multiple groups. This effectively is an invite for interested buyers to experience the whole affair. They may even try a hand at the art of handling massive fishing nets and return not just with fishes but even selfies, of course, in keeping with social distancing norms. “The response to our initiative has been overwhelming, and one day we sold around 1,000 kg of fish. Catch from a few big canoes operated mostly by our relatives at Edavanakkad-Chathangad beach is being sold this way now, while door delivery is restricted to the immediate neighbourhood, though it may be further widened considering the increasing demand from far-off places,” said Mujeeb who was forced into to fish vending from interlock tile laying work by the pandemic.

It is a win-win situation, as fishermen get to sell their catch without intermediaries, and buyers get fresh fish at much reduced prices.

Since canoes cannot always venture into sea, they also sell river fishes, which are brought to Mujeeb’s home during early mornings. “They also generate jobs for people hit by the pandemic. For instance, two widows are engaged for cleaning fishes, while some youngsters help when canoes returns to the shore,” said Bejoy, a local resident who is also a regular customer.

“We cannot let this pandemic crush us but find ways to ovecome it,” said Mujeeb who is also an active social worker.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/7j46la/article32857811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15-KI-EDAVANAKKAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/turning-fish-vending-into-a-vibrant-experience/article32857813.ece
305,2020/10/15,A few puffs and some quick bucks,"Bakery owners taken for a ride by a few youngsters

Can a few puffs and samoosa bring in quick bucks?

As improbable that may sound, two youngsters nabbed by the Mulanthuruthy police last week had allegedly hatched such a plan and were successfully implementing it. One of the co-accused remains yet to be grabbed.

The plan was a rather tried and tested one and used in umpteen Malayalam movies to evoke a few guffaws. “They used to drop in at a bakery where they had some snacks and then bought a few as parcel. In an hour or so, they returned all worked up over a dead lizard in the parcel box. They then put up quite a show with one of them even feigning to double up in pain with stomach ache,” said E.V. Raju, Mulanthuruthy Assistant Sub Inspector.

When the bakery owner offered to take them to the hospital, they rather demanded compensation not to make the incident public. The accused allegedly used to demand ₹50,000 though they settled for much less exploiting the anxiety of bakery owners scared over a potential blot on their shop’s reputation.

They successfully pulled off the ploy and usurped ₹23,500 from a bakery and ₹3,500 from another.

Emboldened, they could have probably gone on with it, if not for a local merchants’ meet in which one of the victims shared his experience only to realise that someone else had been fooled the same way. Wasting no more time, they lodged a petition with the Mulanthuruthy police.

Shortly thereafter, the police tracked down one of the accused and then feigned as a bakery owner willing to pay more to keep them quiet to nab the other.

“It emerged that they had used the same modus operandi to cheat around ₹20,000 from another bakery owner at Thripunithura and two bakeries at Vaikom from where two of the accused hail,” said Mr. Raju.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-few-puffs-and-some-quick-bucks/article32857804.ece
306,2020/10/15,‘Rent waiver not for SmartCity Kochi tenants’,"GO applicable only to companies operating out of Govt. IT parks

The Kakkanad-based SmartCity Kochi has claimed that the State government’s order earlier this month clarifying that it is not a government IT park has absolved it of granting rent waiver and deferment of payments, which, it argues, is applicable only to IT and ITeS companies operating out of buildings owned by government IT parks.

The government had on April 27, in view of the lockdown, had called for waiver and deferment of payments to IT and ITeS companies. In a release issued on Wednesday, the company claimed that the rationale of the order dated October 6 on a representation by four defaulting tenants of SmartCity Kochi clarified the matter beyond doubt.

“It is important to note that the building in SmartCity Kochi where tenants operate from is not owned by the Government IT Parks. The Government IT Parks-owned projects are Technopark, Infopark, and Cyberpark, and the order of April 27 is not even applicable to buildings owned by private developers in these parks, even though the parks are master-planned, owned and developed by the government,” the release said.

It termed as “unfortunate” the alleged unilateral decision by some of its tenants to withhold payment of both rent and maintenance charges.

Since the company was providing all facilities to its tenants, the latter ought to reciprocate by fulfilling their contractual obligations such as timely payment of rent and maintenance charges, said SmartCity Kochi, which further claimed that it had accommodated requests by tenants seeking deferment due to financial crisis in view of mutual coexistence in such times.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/rent-waiver-not-for-smartcity-kochi-tenants/article32857799.ece
307,2020/10/15,Cops transferred with immediate effect,"Alleged assault on youth at Fort Kochi

Three days after the alleged assault on a group of youngsters by the Fort Kochi police, three officers were transferred with immediate effect on Wednesday.

Among those who were transferred were Sub Inspector C.R. Singh, who was hardly 10 days in his post, and civil police officers Sunil Kumar and Gireesh. Additional Commissioner (Kochi City) K.P. Philip issued the order transferring them to Thoppumpady, North and Elamakkara stations respectively, said sources. Mulavukad Sub Inspector K.P. Manesh has been roped in as a replacement.

Fort Kochi Station House Officer G.B. Manuraj had submitted a report on the incident to Mattancherry Assistant Commissioner G.D. Vijayakumar who in turn forwarded it to Mr. Philip with his own take.

All the three transferred officers were part of a police team accused of beating up a group of youngsters who had assembled at a ground adjoining a closed godown near Customs Jetty at Fort Kochi on Sunday evening. There was a public revolt against the alleged police brutality after five youngsters had to be admitted to hospital leading to a protest march to the Fort Kochi police station on the night of the incident.

The protesters left after Mr. Vijayakumar assured them of appropriate action against the officers concerned.

Just like in the immediate aftermath of the incident in which both the victims and the alleged perpetrators presented contradictory versions — while victims claimed that they had assembled for playing cricket and were brutally beaten up by the police without warning, the police dubbed the youngsters anti-social elements and attributed injuries to be sustained while trying to flee them — neither party seems satisfactory about the purported punitive action either.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cops-transferred-with-immediate-effect/article32857793.ece

A Joint Council of Action comprising Income Tax Employees Federation and Income Tax Gazetted Officers Association, together forming around 97% of the workforce, is intensifying its agitation from Thursday maintaining that they had not been consulted before the Prime Minister announced the Faceless Assessment and Appeal Schemes.

In a statement issued here, the officials going on strike also said that major issues affecting the career prospects of officers and other staff under the Central Board of Direct Taxes had been neglected by the board. The issues, they said, included promotions to the grade of Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax (ACIT), Principal Administrative Officer, Income Tax Officer, and Group C grades. There was also a delay in granting senior time scale to promotee ACsIT and regularisation of ad hoc promotions to ACIT and below, they alleged.

311,2020/10/15,"If music be the love of food, play on","From Tyagaraja and Dikshitar to Purandaradasa and Andal, they have all given us recipes in ragas

Samaithu Paar is a cookbook that hardly needs any introduction for South Indians. Written by Meenakshi Ammal several decades ago, it became a best-seller and was later translated into English as Cook and See. Based on this, I have often wondered why a book titled Cook and Sing should not be done based on Carnatic songs that contain recipes for, or carry mention of, various dishes.

I am nowhere near writing such a book, but each time I come across references to dishes I make a note of them and recently when singer S. Sowmya asked me to put together an online quiz, I dedicated one round to food in Carnatic music. And no, it had no questions related to the famous sabha canteens.

Thiruppavai reference

Andal in her Thiruppavai arguably describes the best pongal. The verse, ‘Koodarai Vellum’, is the 27th in the set and after having observed all the austerities during the previous days of Margazhi, Andal sings of pongal, made by boiling rice and milk, in a covered vessel, with so much ghee that when the dish is eaten, the ghee trickles down the elbows. In his ‘Poompavai Padhigam,’ composed at Mylapore, Gnanasambandar sings of pongal with lashings of ghee, cooked by straight-waisted women, during the month of Thai (January).

Annamacharya in the 15th and 16th centuries mentions many food items in his compositions. Of these, ‘Entamatramuna’ mentions the nippatu — crispy deep-fried rice crackers.

How it turns out depends on the quality of batter, says the composer, and adds that this is true even of Venkateswara in Tirumala: those who worship Devi say this is a Goddess, the Kapalikas claim him as Adi Bhairava, and the Vaishnavites say he is Vishnu.

Purandaradasa gives a recipe for payasam in his ‘Ramanama Payasake’. It starts right from the making of the vermicelli itself. But a lesser-known song of his goes to even greater detail. ‘Naivedya Kollo Narayanaswami’ describes a veritable feast and those interested can see Manmathan Ullathil’s blog, www.maddy06.blogspot.com, where he has studied several other Purandaradasa kritis that mention recipes.

Sumptuous feast

Of course, when it comes to a feast who better than a king to prepare the bill of fare? In his ‘Pallaki Seva Prabandha,’ King Shahji of Thanjavur, writing in the 17th century, offers dinner to Lord Tyagesa — sherbets of high quality, pongal, morkuzhambu, rice fritters, pooris fried in ghee, dosas and idlis, pickles, shelled and roasted lentils, sweets, fruits, mixed rice of various kinds, payasam, thirattupaal, honey, curd rice, puliyogare, thick sour cream, spiced buttermilk, water from the Ganges, and paan with camphor. Can’t believe it? Read his ‘Aragimpavayya’ in raga Nadanamakriya.

Could this be the first song to mention dosas? Apparently not. In ‘Daniye Noditheno’, Purandaradasa speaks of Venkateswara feasting on boiled rice and dosas. The sale of prasadam in Tirupati is also not something new. Kanakadasa, a contemporary of Purandaradasa in the 16th century, derides the deity, in his ‘Bandevayya Govinda Shetty’, for commercialising everything, including appam, adhirasam, and the other prasadam on sale. Of course, by far the sweet most closely associated with the shrine is the famous laddu.

There is a theory that Muthuswami Dikshitar in his song ‘Shanka Chakra Gada Panim’ in Purnachandrika mentions this dish in the line ‘Amritasara Bhakshanam’. Apte’s Sanskrit dictionary acknowledges that amritasara is a sweetmeat, but it need not necessarily be the laddu, and as far as we know, the laddu in its present form at Tirumala is a 20th century creation. But yes, as Kanakadasa attests, the place was famous for sweets from much earlier.

Dikshitar, however, does mention sesame rice or ellu sadam in ‘Divakara Tanujam,’ set in raga Yadukula Kamboji. Dedicated as the composition is to Saturn, the song includes the deity’s favourite dish, and it is common practice to see it being offered at temples on Saturdays.

Like Purandaradasa, Kanakadasa also gives us a recipe — for self-realisation, in his ‘Adigeyanu Madabekanna’. I go by Prof. William Jackson’s translation and it starts off right from the washing of the vessel, the cleaning of the ingredients, and the heating of the medium — these being, respectively, truth, arrogance and the body. It is most interesting that almost 400 years later, Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi at Tiruvannamalai created a similar song on the making of the appalam. Translated into English by Prof. K. Swaminathan, it is structured as a straightforward recipe for appalams and is at the same time an exposition on the pathway to realisation.

There are surely many more examples of this kind. We need to cook and sing to find out.

312,2020/10/15,What makes SPB’s Sankarabharanam special,"He blended devotion and melody in an impeccable manner

The passing away of legendary playback singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam (SPB) has made me recall my experience of listening to his songs from when I was in primary school. While SPB sang over 40,000 songs across 16 languages, for me he will live on in the half-a-dozen songs he sang for one Telugu movie. To me these songs highlight the unparalleled power that music possesses to germinate paths of discovery.

For many of us from the South, SPB is synonymous with the Telugu movie Sankarabharanam. Though Tamil is my mother tongue, the incredibly melodious songs sung by SPB in this movie left an indelible mark on me. At a young age, when Carnatic music can seem like Greek and Latin to someone who did not learn it, these songs got deeply rooted in my psyche. When I now wonder why these songs had such a profound impact on my young mind, it becomes clear that the songs and the movie — as complementary to each other as a lamp and its wick — uplift and inspire in a way that I have found nonpareil.

The beauty of Sankarabharanam is that it is but the first step of an incredible journey of discovery. SPB’s songs were the most important step that drew me into this journey. Over the years, I have watched the movie more than a dozen times, and each time, I discovered something new.

On each occasion, I have been drawn into watching the movie after I felt like listening to one of its eternal songs. After marvelling at the devotion the songs induce, I would feel inspired to unlock their meaning. Then, my appetite whetted, I invariably watched the movie to understand the context of the song. This process, from melody to meaning to context, has been a deeply enriching personal journey, as it has helped me understand the spiritual ethos we inherit as Indians.

Song with a message

A line from the last song in the movie, ‘ragalanantalu nee veyi roopalu bhava roga timirala pokarchu deepalu,’ captures beautifully the essence of this ethos. ‘Your thousands of forms are like the infinite number of ragas that dispel the darkness of worldly bondage’. That the divine can be attained through music (Nada Bramhan), through selfless action (Karma Yoga), through pursuit of knowledge (Jnana Yoga) or through sincere devotion (Bhakti Yoga) is a credo that carries in its embryo the truth that the divine can be attained through unshakeable faith in any religion.

In this context, I have realised how secularism in the Indian ethos is different from the Western conception. The subtle but crucial difference is akin to the difference between the numbers 0 and 1. Though adjacent to each other, metaphysically the numbers capture opposites: 0 conveys nothing while 1 captures entirety. The Western conception resembles the number zero, that is, no religion, while the Indian concept of secularism resembles the number one, that is, taking in the entirety of all religions, paths, faiths and beliefs. By being all inclusive, the Indian conception makes no distinction among them.

The film’s title song captures the many nuances of our spiritual ethos and the role of music. A key stanza describes music as life or essence (sangeetame pranamu) as well as the staircase (ganame sopanamu) for advaita siddhiki, to attain the state of Advaita or non-duality, where the worshipper and the worshipped merge into each other; for amaratva labdhiki, to gain immortality; for satva sadhanaku, undertaking penance to achieve harmony within oneself and thereby with the universe and all its beings; and for satya shodhanaku, the pursuit of the eternal truth.

Devotional aspect

SPB’s songs in this movie uplift one in so many ways. Take the song ‘Shankara, nada sharirapara.’ Every time I listen to it, I am moved not only by the bhakti embedded in it but also by the impact that pure devotion is shown to have on the divine. As SPB entreats the divine with his incredibly high notes that few can match, the clouds burst, affirming godly disapproval of social discrimination. The song also goads one to pursue one’s convictions irrespective of social criticism.

SPB’s last song in the film is by far the best as it embodies the virtue of niswartha seva or selfless service: ‘Dorakuna itu vanti seva?’ (Will I be blessed with the privilege to serve you?) It offers the greatest meaning to us public servants as the divine permeates every living being on this planet. Therefore, serving the people selflessly is ultimate service to the lord.

For offering us this inseparable complementarity between divine songs and an inspiring movie, SPB, you have lived your own words amaratva labdhiki, that is, gained immortality. Such lives must only be celebrated and not mourned.

313,2020/10/15,"Herbert Kretzmer, lyricist of Les Misérables, dead at 95","Tributes poured in from giants of the London stage, including theatrical producer Cameron Mackintosh, singer Elaine Paige and lyricist Tim Rice.

Herbert Kretzmer, the journalist and lyricist best known for his English-language adaptation of the musical Les Misérables, has died. He was 95.

His family confirmed on October 14 that Kretzmer died after a long illness with Parkinson’s disease at the London home he shared with his second wife, Sybil Sever.

Tributes poured in from giants of the London stage, including theatrical producer Cameron Mackintosh, singer Elaine Paige and lyricist Tim Rice.

Les Misérables producer Mackintosh said Kretzmer was instrumental in bringing Victor Hugo’s classic tale of defiance and redemption in early 19th century France to the stage in English in October 1985, five years after it had opened in Paris.

“His wonderful words for Les Misérables will live on in his memory forever more,” he said in a statement.

For Paige, he was a masterful wordsmith while Rice described Kretzmer a great lyricist and man of theatre and a giant of his trade. Kretzmer, known as Herbie to his friends, was born in Kroonstad, a small town south of Johannesburg, South Africa, in October 1925. He was one of four sons of Jewish-Lithuanian immigrants who ran a grocery shop and later a prosperous furniture store.

“Though his childhood under the vast expanse of South African sky was blissful,” he wanted by the age of 11 to become a newspaper man — so he could get closer to his heroes on screen.

From Johannesburg, he moved to Paris in 1953, playing the piano by night in a bar in return for a meal. A year later, he moved to London and fulfilled his dream of being at the heart of the movie action, in an award-winning journalistic career that included stints at the Daily Express and Daily Mail.

His catalog of interviews reads like a Who’s Who? of 20th century entertainment, including Muhammad Ali, Judy Garland, Groucho Marx, David Niven and Frank Sinatra. Some interviewees, like Peter Sellers and Terence Stamp, became close friends.

The music was never far away though. He wrote weekly songs in the 1960s for That Was The Week That Was, the BBC’s ground-breaking satirical show that proved the launchpad for the careers of luminaries in the world of television over subsequent decades, such as John Cleese and David Frost.

Some songs were humorous, such as Goodness Gracious Me, others more poignant, notably In the Summer of His Years, a tribute to President John F. Kennedy that was written hours after his assassination on Nov. 22, 1963.

There were further songs, including She, which he wrote with French singer Charles Aznavour and which topped the U.K. Singles Charts for a month in 1974. He explained decades later that it was about a British woman with whom he had recently broken up following a year-long affair.

But the really big time never quite came. Until a young British producer by the name of Cameron Mackintosh invited Kretzmer to tea in June 1984 and his life changed.

Though the expanded English version of Les Misérables — it was never Les Mis for Kretzmer — had mixed reviews at the start, it would soon become one of the biggest successes of 20th century theatre.

Were it not for the coronavirus pandemic, it’d still be running in London, testament to the enduring popularity of the story as well as the songs, such as “I Dreamed a Dream,” “One Day More and Do You Hear the People Sing? Add Suddenly” to that list, the song he wrote for the 2012 blockbuster version that earned him at the age of 87 an Academy Award nomination.

314,2020/10/15,"In Kolkata, reopening of theatres fails to enthuse crowds","We are expecting crowds to come in only during Durga Puja, say owners

The city on Thursday saw a token reopening of its cinema halls after a gap of nearly seven months as only two theatres resumed business with safety protocols in place. The remaining will open either on Friday — when new films are traditionally released — or during Durga Puja.

The theatres that reopened included INOX at Swabhumi, on the fringes of Salt Lake City, and Rupmandir in Belghoria. While the films screened at INOX included one new release, Ebhabei Golpo Hok; the single-screen Rupmandir reopened with reruns of Dwitiyo Purush and Sushant Singh Rajput’s Kedarnath.

Watch | COVID-19: Guidelines for exhibition of films

For these theatres on Thursday, it was not so much about getting audiences back but more about finally being able to reopen after almost seven months — a better part of the year. Theatres across the country had shut in late March due to the COVID-19 pandemic and only a small number of them reopened on Thursday, including nearly 70 across West Bengal.

“Eight people had booked tickets for the noon show but the tickets could not be issued for technical reasons, so I had to cancel the show. For the matinee show, when we screened Dwitiyo Purush, there were only two people in the theatre. For the evening show, my staff tell me that about 10 people have entered the hall [to watch Kedarnath], though I am not sure,” Santanu Ray Chaudhuri, who runs the stand-alone Rupmandir, told The Hindu on Thursday evening.

“It was not as if I was expecting people to pour in. As it is people hardly go to [standalone] theatres these days. The idea behind reopening the hall today — I even put posters all over — was to make people aware that we have reopened. I am expecting crowds to come in only during Puja,” Mr. Ray Chaudhuri said.

At INOX, the ticket window remained empty almost the entire morning and afternoon; from time to time, there were people walking in its direction, and just when one thought that they had come to watch a film, they all turned out to be customers of the adjacent wine shop. In the absence of ticket-buyers, local TV channels coaxed some of them to pretend as movie-watchers.

The theatre, however, strictly followed safety protocols. There were floor markers outside the box office and it was issuing only paperless tickets, that too only for alternate seats. The guard with a metal detector now also held a thermal scanner. No one without a mask is going to be allowed in, and for the negligent, a safety kit — a mask, pair of gloves and hand sanitiser — has been put on sale for ₹30.

A staff said five to seven people were watching Shubh Mangal Zyada Savdhaan and that more people were likely to walk in during the evening, but INOX officially declined to say how many tickets were sold for Thursday. A spokesperson, however, said INOX would soon be offering private screenings for small groups — of friends and families — and would also introduce immunity boosters, such as turmeric latte, in its menu.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/bdbzw1/article32863711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG9992,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/in-kolkata-reopening-of-theatres-fails-to-enthuse-crowds/article32863712.ece
315,2020/10/15,Coronavirus | Doctors asked not to leave Kolkata during Durga Puja,"WBCERC urges private hospitals to keep a note of the contact details of the doctors so that they can be reached in case of emergency

Amid apprehensions of a probable surge of COVID-19 cases in the State during Durga Puja, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) has asked doctors not to leave the city during the four days of the festival.

The WBCERC has also urged private hospitals to keep a note of the contact details of the doctors so that they can be reached in case of emergency, its chairman Justice (Retd) Ashim Kumar Banerjee said.

“Generally doctors remain very busy throughout the year and go out of the city during these four days of festivities. But this year at this hour of crisis, if the doctors, irrespective of their specialisation, stay in the city it will be of great help.

“We will also request private hospitals to prepare a database of contacts of the doctors as well as their addresses so that they can be reached if there is a crisis,” he said.

The Commission has also requested private hospitals to prepare a list of specialists of the eyes, ENT or skin and surgeons who do not treat COVID-19 patients so that they can be engaged in case of urgent demand during the festive season, he said.

Private hospitals can also prepare lists of such doctors so that they can supplement the manpower in COVID wards of their respective hospitals in case of a sudden surge in corona infections during the Durga Pujas, Justice Banerjee said.

The Commission has also requested the private hospital authorities to prepare a list of patients who have recovered from the disease so that they can donate plasma and provide voluntary service at the hospitals for the coronavirus affected during the festival.

WBCERC has also asked private hospitals to charge patients for a day only after they complete staying there for 24 hours and not from a fixed hour of the day.

“However, in cases where the whole stay in hospital is less than 24 hours, the hospitals may charge for a day,” it said in an order.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9zt5du/article32362586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/coronavirus-doctors-asked-not-to-leave-kolkata-during-durga-puja/article32862541.ece

The Calcutta High Court on Thursday sought to know from the West Bengal government its justification for doling out ₹50,000 to community Durga pujas, amid the austerity measures being pursued by the State in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hearing a petition challenging the government’s decision to disburse ₹50,000 to community Durga pujas, a division bench comprising justices Sanjib Banerjee and Arijit Banerjee also enquired if financial aid was being given for other festivals, such as Eid.

It further asked the State whether any guideline has been laid down for such expenditure as it is public money that is being doled out as grant to the puja organisers.

The State government, on its part, told the court that grant was meant for raising public awareness on COVID-19 control, purchase of sanitisers and masks.

Asserting that accounts of expenditure have to be well maintained, the bench suggested that Advocate General Kishore Dutta, who represents the State, and senior counsel Bikash Bhattacharya, appearing for the petitioner, hold a conference on all such matters, and inform the court of its outcome on Friday, when the case would be taken up for hearing again.

The court also asked whether any blueprint for crowd control during Durga Puja — which is barely a week away — have been prepared by the government to prevent the spread of the viral disease.

The petition, challenging the grant of ₹50,000 and other benefits — such as discounts on application fees for permissions from Fire Brigade and electric supply boards — to thousands of community Durga Pujas, was filed by Sourav Dutta, a Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) leader.

Dutta claimed that the government’s decision was not in tune with the concept of secularism in India, and hurts the fundamental rights provided in the Constitution.

Legendary actor Soumitra Chatterjee’s health condition has improved though doctors decided to continue monitoring him closely as the octogenarian’s comorbidities remained a matter of concern, a senior physician at the medical facility said on Thursday.

The 85-year-old thespian, who tested negative for coronavirus on Wednesday, was administered “musical therapy” and physiotherapy on Thursday, a doctor said.

Mr Chatterjee has been shifted to a non -OVID-19 ward.

318,2020/10/15,"Calcutta HC quashes criminal proceedings against Babul Supriyo, but calls his remarks against Mahua defamatory","Mahua Moitra had filed a complaint against him in 2017.

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday quashed criminal proceedings against Union Minister Babul Supriyo on the basis of a chargesheet filed by the Kolkata Police in an FIR lodged by Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra on the grounds that the “chargesheet does not disclose commission of any offence under Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code...”

However, the court observed that the utterance made by the Minister was “defamatory statement within the meaning of Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code” and added that Ms. Moitra was “at liberty to take any action, according to law, if available to her against the petitioner before the appropriate forum and in such case”.

The case pertains to developments in January 2017, during a debate on a news channel Mr. Supriyo, the BJP MP from Asansol made a comment “Mohua, are you on Mohua?” alluding of the intoxicating liquor called Mohua which is drunk in many tribal areas in India. Ms Moitra, who was a Trinamool Congress MLA then, filed a complaint against Mr. Supriyo at police station in Kolkata.

In the order Justice Bibek Chaudhuri rejected the arguments made by Mr. Supriyo’s counsel that the statement was an ""accidental slip of words"", not intended to defame the opposite party. “ It is expected from a representative of the people that he must be courteous in his behavior, dignified in his manners and cautious on his words spoken by him” the order said.

In the 32 page order Justice Chaudhuri that at the relevant point of time when the remarks were made Ms. Moitra was an elected member of West Bengal Legislative Assembly and national spokesperson of rival political party.

The Court went on to say that by making “such defamatory statement to a woman , the petitioner prima facie, not only humiliated dignity and honour of a woman, but also violated his constitutional oath. If doubt is raised in the mind of people from the utterances made by the petitioner that the at the relevant point of time she was drunken and intoxicated…” adding that the “utterance made by the petitioner was defamatory statement within the meaning of Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code”.

Justice Chaudhuri also added Constitutional mandate under Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles of state policy that “dignity of woman must be protected and freedom of speech and expression enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) is subject to reasonable restrictions and one of such restrictions is penal provision against defamation.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/skmc4p/article31297798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-CALCUTTA-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/calcutta-hc-quashes-criminal-proceedings-against-babul-supriyo/article32857449.ece
319,2020/10/15,Muslim organisations demand changes in COVID-19 protocol,"To facilitate respectful treatment and burial of bodies

A meeting of various Muslim religious organisations on Thursday requested the State government to consider some reasonable amendments to the existing COVID-19 protocol to facilitate respectful treatment and burial of bodies.

The meeting, which was chaired by Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader E.T. Mohammed Basheer, MP, in Kozhikode, also called upon the Health Department to check whether it was actually giving a decent funeral to COVID-19 victims as guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.

“Now, the State government is enforcing a protocol, which was not even recommended by the World Health Organisation in the case of COVID-19 victims,” said Mr. Basheer. The government should accept some healthy and reasonable changes in rules considering religious sentiments, he added.

Religious leaders who attended the meeting said there should be freedom for bathing the body, as it was an essential part of funeral ritual in Islam. The support of trained volunteers or family members of the victim could be used for the purpose rather than leaving the job to sanitation workers, they pointed out.

Considering safety issues, some leaders said they would recommend the Islamic act of dry ritual purification method using purified sand or dust (Tayammum), which was often accepted in situations where water could not be used for the ritual. They appealed to the government to realise the sentiments of the faithful at the grassroots level.

320,2020/10/15,‘Intellectually challenged students being deprived of hi-tech facilities’,"Special educators not updated enough for proper use of technology, says Parivar

Hi-tech status of government schools in the State is being celebrated. But how far is the claim genuine, when the facilities available for normal students are being denied to students with intellectual disabilities?

Under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, intellectually challenged students are to be provided with the same facilities that normal students enjoy at schools. While normal students have access to facilities like laptop computers and smart classrooms in hi-tech schools, intellectually challenged students do not even get their rightful resource rooms, according to the State unit of Parivar under the National Confederation of Parents Organisations (NCPO) for the welfare of intellectually challenged persons. “Our children still wait for the mercy of non-governmental organisations for simple requirements such as adaptive and sensory devices,” said Thekkayil Rajan, district president of Parivar.

He added that though schools had become hi-tech, social justice is non-existent as far as intellectually challenged students are concerned.

Parivar claimed that online sessions for intellectually challenged students were deplorable.

“The classes are so boring, as teachers are not updated enough to use technology to make the sessions interesting. While virtual reality and visual aids are being used for normal students, intellectually challenged students get no such treats,” said M.P. Karunakaran, State president of Parivar.

“Complaints have been raised about the standard of special educators. We do not even have permanent posts for special educators. Those we have now have been appointed under some projects,” Mr. Karunakaran added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/intellectually-challenged-students-being-deprived-of-hi-tech-facilities/article32857851.ece
321,2020/10/15,Dean appointment: Calicut varsity to approach govt.,"‘There is confusion if it is an academic or an administrative post’

Calicut University will approach the State government to clear the confusion if the Dean, Students’ Welfare, is an academic or an administrative post.

P.V. Valsaraj, the incumbent, retires on October 31, and the Syndicate on September 9 had decided to issue a notification for appointment to replace him. The move had led to criticism that the university was violating its own statues and the Kerala Public Service Commission should have been informed about it.

“There is some confusion if it is an academic or an administrative post. The government will be informed about it and the air will be cleared,” M.K. Jayaraj, Vice-Chancellor, told The Hindu. An advertisement calling for applications would be placed only after that, Mr. Jayaraj said, adding that the university would stick to the rules.

It has been pointed out that Ordinance 3, Chapter XV, Scales of Pay, Qualification etc. of Various Posts in the University of Calicut, and the University First Ordinance, 1978, say that the post is a non-teaching one with the scale of pay fixed under University Grants Commission stipulations. The Kerala Public Service Commission (Additional Functions as Respects the Service Under the Universities) Act, 2015, says that the public service commission should prepare the select list for the appointment to the posts of non-teaching staff by direct recruitment of employees.

Member’s dissent

Citing a government letter dated February 19, 2013, Syndicate member P. Rasheed Ahammed claimed that the Registrar and Controller of Examinations were the only non-teaching posts to which Syndicate can make appointment.

In a letter to Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, Mr. Ahammed pointed out that the university could have reported the vacancy to the KPSC to prepare the list. He claimed that the Syndicate resolved to notify the vacancy despite his note of dissent.

Mr. Ahammed said that this was a violation of the above Act which mandated consultation with the KPSC on all matters related to the method of recruitment of non-teaching staff.

Mr. Ahammed urged the Governor to annul the Syndicate resolution in line with provisions of 7(3) of Calicut University Act, 1975.

He also alleged that an attempt was being made to appoint people favourable to the university authorities to the post.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/dean-appointment-calicut-varsity-to-approach-govt/article32857096.ece
322,2020/10/15,HC takes serious view of mismanagement of DPCs,"Court asks State to respond to PIL plea today

MADURAI

Taking a serious view of mismanagement of direct purchase centres (DPCs), the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday put forth a series of queries to the State in order to safeguard the interests of farmers. The court directed the government to file its response on October 16.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that because of abundant rain, the agriculture yield was good and farmers were bringing more paddy to the DPCs. However, the officials were making them wait for days together.

The poor farmers had no place to keep the paddy and since it was rainy season, there was a possibility of the grains getting damaged. It was also alleged that the officials were procuring from private traders instead of the farmers, the judges said.

Further, the court observed that bribe was being demanded from the farmers for purchase of the paddy and officials were rejecting the paddy on the grounds that the moisture content was more and non-availability of sufficient number of gunny bags at the DPCs.

In order to ascertain the situation, the court asked the State to give the number of procurement centres in Tamil Nadu, and tell whether the paddy procured was stored in temporary centres before being moved to godowns and warehouses.

The judges further asked why the government had not put up temporary sheds to keep the paddy, whether it was true that sufficient number of gunny bags were not available and whether bribe was being demanded.

The court also asked whether paddy was procured from private traders instead of the farmers, how many bags were damaged and what measures were taken to procure paddy effectively and swiftly.

329,2020/10/15,Two country made bombs seized,"Three persons detained at Valantharavai near Ramanathapuram

The bomb detection and disposal squad team seized two country made bombs and detained three persons at Valantharavai near here on Thursday.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that it was intended to settle scores between two gangs, which were indulging in illegal acts such as selling ganja and other narcotics.

A senior officer, who was camping at Valantharavai, said that two gangs belonging to Bas alias Baskaran and Dharma alias Dharmaraj were operating in the locality for many years.

Frequently, they indulged in clashes, which sometimes, had snowballed into violence and ended in murders or attempted murders.

In May 2018, two men (Boominathan and Vijay) associated with Bas alias Baskaran gang were murdered by their rivals. In a bid to retaliate, two accomplices of Dharmaraj’s gang were murdered by hurling country bombs on 16, October 2018.

After witnessing four grave crimes within the Kenikarai police station, the police deployed additional forces and pickets in Valantharavai.

Under such circumstances, when the first anniversary was observed by the rivals last year, the police teams seized a country made bomb and weapons from a dilapidated building in the locality. In a similar fashion, the police control room received a call informing it that there were country made bombs in a private farm.

Immediately, a team led by DSP Velladurai and others rushed to the spot and seized two country made bombs from a farm belonging to one Suresh (33).

Along with him, the police arrested Dharmar (35) and Boominathan (42) for interrogation.

Based on their confession, the police said that they had seized the bombs at the right time as the gangs had planned an attack in a day or two.

In view of the death anniversary, additional pickets were deployed at Valantharavai, the officer said.

A senior officer said that they had tightened the ganja sale by intensifying vigil across the district.

All check posts were under surveillance, which had forced the gangs to relocate to other districts.

Praying for a CB-CID probe, Boominathan filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court Bench at Madurai on September 28, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/awou4j/article32867600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15FILEPHOTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/bombs/article32864439.ece

The powerful oratory, hard work and simple living practised by the late President were recalled by speakers.

The webinar enlightened on the significance of peace and spirituality in order to foster unity. The webcasts were available in 14 different languages including Russian, Korean, Japanese, German, Portugese and French, among others, Mr. Sheik Saleem said.

The members of Nehru Yuva Kendra from Madurai had undertaken a cycle rally creating awareness among the people of the need to acquire knowledge, which was close to Dr Kalam. They reached the memorial marking the anniversary and distributed pamphlets about Dr Kalam en route.

Many educational institutions across southern districts conducted many events, garlanded the portrait of Dr Kalam and distributed prizes to winners of competitions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/azjoq2/article32867615.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15KALAMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/kalam/article32863943.ece
334,2020/10/15,Regulated coconut markets come to the rescue of farmers,"The auction has removed the role of middlemen who buy for cheap and sell with a huge margin in the market

In the past two months, around 1.50 lakh coconuts have been sold for around ₹19.13 lakh through indirect auctioning held at two regulated markets in the district - Melur and Vadipatti - functioning under Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business Department. A good number of farmers are selling their coconuts at the regulated markets as they are able to earn handsome profits.

Madurai Market Committee secretary V. Mercy Jeyarani says auction at Vadipatti market is conducted every Wednesday since August 17, and at Melur on every Thursday since October 10. A total of 67 farmers have sold their coconuts at the two markets and 103 traders have taken part in the auction process.

“It was a long-time demand of farmers to conduct auctioning for coconuts at regulated markets. We have started WhatsApp groups and asked farmers and traders to participate in the auction. Since the auction has removed the role of middlemen who used to buy the coconuts at a cheap rate from the farmers and sell them with a huge margin in the market, the farmers earn good profits through auction,” she said.

Coconut plantations have been raised on around 10,000 hectares in Madurai district, mostly in Vadipatti, Sholavandan and Kottampatti. Every day, around 20 trucks of coconuts are sent from Sholavandan to Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and other States.

S. Manimaran of Vadipatti Integrated Farming System Farmers Producer Company says coconut farmers earn a tidy sum - better the quality of the nuts, more the price. Usually farmers are required to give away 150 coconuts with every 1,000 coconuts a trader buys. “But the regulated markets have put an end to this practice, and the farmers are happy as they earn more now,” he says.

Must be segregated

Ms. Jeyarani says farmers are asked to segregate the coconuts based on quality and bring them separately to the market.

“This ensures that even decent quality coconuts fetch reasonable prices, which is a big advantage to the farmers,” says M. Rajendran, president of Vadipatti Coconut Farmers’ Association. The highest bid for a coconut through the auctioning has been ₹18.

S. Durai, a farmer from Kachirayanpatti in Melur block, says an added advantage is that farmers are paid for their produce by the traders immediately after the auction. In some cases, the traders do online fund transfer to the farmer’s account or issue a cheque, says Ms. Jeyarani.

Mr. Rajendran says while there is an increase in the number of farmers selling their produce at the regulated markets, more farmers must participate in the auctioning process.

T. Perumal, national secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, says prices of coconuts will stabilise in the open market if the auctioning is done every day. Ms.Jeyarani says they will gradually increase the number of days of auction after having consultantations with farmers and traders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/inmgnr/article32863867.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16MACITY-COCONUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/regulated-coconut-markets-come-to-the-rescue-of-farmers/article32863868.ece
335,2020/10/15,DMK cadre demand removal of V-C,"‘He has been functioning in an autocratic manner ever since he assumed office’

The DMK youth and the students’ wing organised demonstration here on Thursday condemning the Vice-Chancellor of Anna University Surappa for having “unilaterally” written a letter to the Union Government on mobilising on its own the funds required for attaining ‘Institute of Eminence’ status and demanding his removal from the post.

Led by Durai, deputy organiser of youth wing, they staged a demonstration in front of Anna University’s Regional Office here on the Government College of Engineering premises on Tirunelveli – Nagercoil Highway and raised slogans demanding the immediate ouster of Prof. Surappa.

They said the VC had been functioning in “autocratic manner” ever since he assumed office as he was enjoying the blessings of the ‘saffron party’. When the Union Government decided to bring the Anna University under its control with the motive of denying reservations to the students of Backward Classes, a proposal to offer ‘Institute of Eminence’ status to the university was made for which the State Government had to ensure the allocation of ₹ 1,500 crore over a period of five years as its share.

However, without consulting the Tamil Nadu government, Prof. Surappa had written a letter to the Union Government saying that the Anna University itself had the ability to mobilize this fund to get the ‘Institute of Eminence’ status. Instead of seeking permission from the Tamil Nadu government, which founded the Anna University, for allocation of funds for development of the institution, he was functioning in “unilateral manner” for facilitating the Centre’s “ulterior motive” of bringing Anna University under its control in every aspect. They alleged that the proposed division of Anna University would seriously affect its standards.

In the agitation organised in front of Anna University Constituent Engineering College, members of the DMK’s students and the youth wing participated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/c1gasc/article32867581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15DMK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dmk/article32863625.ece
336,2020/10/15,102 stolen mobile phones recovered,"Handed over to owners

The owners of 102 mobile phones got back their stolen phones on Thursday.

Two special teams, formed to crack 102 complaints of theft since 2019, recovered all mobile phones, worth about ₹ 10 lakh, with the help of International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI).

Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar, who handed over the recovered mobile phones to the owners at the District Police Office, said banking details, photos, scanned copies of important documents including Aadhaar card should not be stored as those who stole the phones might misuse this information. Apart from monetary loss, such attempts by anti-social elements who had stolen the phones, would attract unnecessary legal issues.

Urging the public to wear helmets while riding two-wheelers and fasten seatbelts while travelling in cars, he said such practices would avoid loss of life even in the event of road accidents. The SP urged the public to wear masks as they come out of their houses as COVID-19 was still a serious threat to everyone even though the positivity rate had come down.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/phone/article32863471.ece

342,2020/10/15,Keonics plans to develop IT Park,"It is aimed at generating more employment opportunities in the coastal region

Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation (Keonics), a State government undertaking, has drawn up plans to develop a medium size Information Technology Park on its land in Mangaluru with a view to generating more employment for the youth in the coastal region. The Board of Directors took the decision to develop the IT Park on the 3.75 acres of land in Kuntikana-Derebail in its recent meeting, Keonics Chairman Harikrishna Bantwal told The Hindu.

It would be a public-private partnership initiative with the participation of Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) and supported by the Confederation of Real Estate Developers of India and the Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he said.

Mr. Bantwal said that he recently held discussions with the Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada about the modalities to take forward the proposal. Keonics seeks to develop IT infrastructure in Tier 2 cities such as Mangaluru thereby reducing the burden on Bengaluru.

The proposal was to invest ₹ 30 crore from the State government and another ₹ 30 crore from MSCL.

Having about 2 lakh sq ft floor space, the park would provide space mainly for Electronics System Design Manufacturing, Biotechnology and other initiatives. It would also provide space for incubation centres for start-ups with 340 seats as well as IT and IT-enabled services.

There would be two blocks of nine floors each at the proposed IT Park, detailed project report of which was prepared by the IDFC.

Kanara Chamber president Issac Vas had in December last written to Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, in-charge of IT and BT departments, to help set up an IT Park in Mangaluru that has an abundant talent pool.

The region with over 20 engineering colleges and over 100 non-engineering colleges produces thousands of graduates every year.

The space earmarked for Keonics at Kuntikana-Derebail was best suited to develop the IT Park, Mr. Vas said and added that it was also located adjacent to the Software Technology Park of India.

KCCI’s initiative — Centre for entrepreneurship Opportunities and Learning — supported by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, too was functioning close to its capacity, he had said. Companies incubated for 18 months in this centre have to move out; but no commercial space was available in Mangaluru for them.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/keonics-plans-to-develop-it-park/article32857518.ece
343,2020/10/15,‘Latest stimulus to have minimal growth impact’,"Small scale a credit negative: Moody’s

The government’s latest fiscal stimulus measures will have a minimal impact on India’s growth prospects, rating agency Moody’s Investors Service said on Thursday, stressing that their ‘small scale’ is actually a credit negative as it reflects the country has ‘limited budgetary firepower to support the economy’.

On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a leave travel cash voucher scheme and an interest-free festival advance of ₹10,000 for all central government employees, to spur consumer demand. She also announced a ₹25,000 crore enhancement in the Centre’s capital spending and a 50-year loan facility worth ₹12,000 crore for States to expand capital expenditure.

Moody’s expects India’s GDP to shrink 11.5% in 2020-21, so the 0.5% of GDP gain expected by the government from these stimulus measures will provide only ‘a small boost’, it pointed out. The package amounts to a fiscal cost of 0.2% of real GDP this year, as per the rating agency.

‘Weak fiscal position’

“Notwithstanding the fiscal prudence of the measures, the small scale of the stimulus highlights limited budgetary firepower to support the economy during a very sharp contraction, a credit negative... India’s very weak fiscal position has constrained its scope for discretionary stimulus spending in response to the coronavirus shock,” Moody’s observed.

“Even when combined with the fiscal stimulus earlier in 2020, the size of the measures remains modest. In total, the two rounds of stimulus bring the government’s direct spending on coronavirus-related fiscal support to around 1.2% of GDP. This compares with an average of around 2.5% of GDP for Baa-rated peers as of mid-June,” the firm said in a note. The average fiscal stimulus of 13 Baa-rated nations was calculated from the International Monetary Fund’s database of fiscal policy responses to COVID-19, for this comparison.

India’s rating is Baa3 negative as per Moody’s, following a downgrade this June from Baa2 negative. The country’s policymaking institutions will be challenged in enacting policies that effectively mitigate the risks of a sustained period of relatively low growth, significant further deterioration in the general government fiscal position and stress in the financial sector, the agency had said in its rationale for the downgrade.

‘Growth may rebound’

Consumer confidence, the agency pointed out, has remained subdued even as India has emerged from a very stringent nationwide lockdown, which drove a 24.5% year-on-year contraction in private consumption in the April-June quarter.

While Moody’s has forecast growth to rebound to 10.6% in 2021-22, due to base effects and a gradual normalisation in economic activity, it expects growth to settle around 6% over the medium term, with downside risks that partly arise from ‘ongoing stress’ within India’s financial system.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/h0yewf/article32565317.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBUMOODYS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/latest-stimulus-to-have-minimal-growth-impact/article32865501.ece
344,2020/10/15,GST shortfall | Centre to borrow ₹1.1 lakh crore on behalf of States,"Opposition leaders termed the decision as a change of stance from the central government, while economists welcomed it as a cleaner way of raising the necessary funds swiftly.

The Centre on October 15 made a departure from its stance that States should undertake market borrowings to bridge the ₹1.1 lakh crore of GST compensation shortfall this year, stating that the Government of India will now undertake the required borrowings in tranches and pass it on to States as a ‘back-to-back loan’ that will reflect on their own books.

The move may break the impasse between the Centre and States over the issue of borrowings to recompense the latter, with consensus remaining elusive despite extensive parleys over three meetings of the GST Council.

By October 14, 21 States and Union Territories such as Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir had acceded to the Centre’s proposal that States undertake the borrowings to meet the GST compensation shortfall, with principal and interest repayments to be paid from future GST cess collections. States such as Kerala and West Bengal, which had been insistent on the Centre undertaking the borrowings, had begun preparing to move the apex court over the matter.

Opposition leaders termed the October 15 decision as a change of stance from the central government, while economists welcomed it as a cleaner way of raising the necessary funds swiftly and bring the focus back to fighting the pandemic on the ground.

“If the Centre has decided to borrow the ₹1.1 lakh crore and extend it to the states as back-to-back loans, I welcome the change of position,” former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said.

Also read | GST revenues cross ₹95,000 crore in September

N.R. Bhanumurthy, vice-chancellor of the Bengaluru Ambedkar School of Economics University said, “This is a wise, timely and non-disruptive move from the Centre, especially when some States were planning to move the Supreme Court.” He added: “It will offer a big breather to States, particularly those that have high fiscal deficits and would have had to pay higher rates if they approached the market.”

In its original proposal put up at the GST Council meeting in August, the Centre said the shortfall on account of GST implementation will be borrowed by States through issue of debt under a Special Window coordinated by the Finance Ministry. “The GOI will endeavour to keep the cost at or close to the G-sec yield, and in the event of the cost being higher, will bear the margin between G-secs and average of State Development Loan yields up to 0.5% through a subsidy,” it had said.

Mr. Bhanumurthy said the new approach of the Centre borrowing from the market is a far simpler mechanism and may help bring the reluctant States on board.

Asserting that this borrowing, to be conducted through a special window, won’t affect the Centre’s fiscal deficit or expand general government debt, the finance ministry said this is being done to ensure that States won’t have to pay different interest rates for these borrowings. This will also be an administratively easier arrangement, the Ministry pointed out.

“Under the Special Window, the estimated shortfall of ₹1.1 lakh cr (assuming all States join) will be borrowed by Government of India in appropriate tranches. The amount so borrowed will be passed on to the States as a back-to-back loan in lieu of GST Compensation Cess releases,” the finance ministry said in a statement.

“This will not have any impact on the fiscal deficit of the Government of India (GOI). The amounts will be reflected as the capital receipts of the State Governments and as part of financing of its respective fiscal deficits,” the ministry explained, adding that this will avoid the prospect of individual States having to pay differential interest rates if they borrowed this corpus as a State development loan.

On October 15 morning, Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac said that some States are likely to approach the Supreme Court against ‘discriminatory and illegal action of Centre regarding GST Compensation’. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had planned to take a final decision on the State’s stance at a meeting with top officials.

The Finance Ministry stressed that the country’s general government debt, which includes both the Centre’s and States’ borrowings will not increase due to this step. “The States that get the benefit from the Special Window are likely to borrow a considerably lesser amount from the additional borrowing facility of 2% of GSDP (from 3% to 5%) under the Aatma Nirbhar Package,” it noted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/p7z8iv/article31845453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17BUMINISTRYOFFINANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/centre-to-borrow-on-behalf-of-states-to-meet-gst-shortfall/article32864640.ece

Low consumer confidence

Consumer confidence, the agency pointed out, has remained subdued even as India has emerged from a very stringent nationwide lockdown, which drove a 24.5% year-on-year contraction in private consumption in the April-June quarter.

“The number of coronavirus cases in India is still elevated and the relaxation of restrictions on educational establishments, entertainment facilities and gatherings from 15 October raises the risk of spread, which could weigh further on consumer sentiment,” it said.

While Moody’s has forecast growth to rebound to 10.6% in 2021-22, due to base effects and a gradual normalisation in economic activity, it expects growth to settle around 6% over the medium term, with downside risks that partly arise from ‘ongoing stress’ within India’s financial system.

Debt burden

Despite stimulus measures till date being about half of it similarly rated peer countries, Moody’s expects general government debt burden to peak at around 90% this year, from 72% in 2019-20. This, it said, is significantly higher than the median of 59% for Baa-rated countries.

“In fiscal 2020, we expect weaker government revenue, driven by the economic contraction and reduced corporate tax rates announced in September 2019, to widen the general government deficit to around 12% of GDP,” Moody’s said.

346,2020/10/15,World experiencing one of the deepest recessions since Great Depression due to COVID-19: World Bank,"The world is experiencing one of the deepest recessions since the Great Depression in the 1930s owing to the novel coronavirus, World Bank President David Malpass has said, terming the COVID-19 pandemic a “catastrophic event” for many developing and the poorest countries.

He told reporters that given the extent of the economic contraction, there was a rising risk of disruptive debt crises in countries.

So that has got a lot of focus here at the meetings, Mr. Malpass told the media on Wednesday at the start of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

“The recession has been deep, one of the deepest since the Great Depression. And for many developing countries, and for the people in the poorest countries, it is truly a depression, a catastrophic event. It is continuing to add to the ranks of those in extreme poverty,” he said.

That is the focus of this meeting and the focus of their actions, he said, adding that the World Bank was building as big a growth programme for countries as they can in this fiscal year.

A day earlier, the Board approved the extension of the health emergency programmes to up to $12 billion for vaccines and therapeutics and distribution of those in countries that do not otherwise have access.

Responding to a question, Mr. Malpass said that the world was currently experiencing a K-shaped recovery.

That means that the advanced economies have been able to provide support, especially for their financial markets and for people that have jobs that can be done by working from home. But people that are in the informal economy have lost their jobs, and are depending on social protection programmes, he said.

For the developing countries, and especially the poorest developing countries, that downward leg in the K is an increasingly desperate recession or depression that is facing people in the poorest countries because of the loss of jobs, the loss of income, and also the loss of remittances coming from workers, working outside the country, Mr. Malpass said.

“What we’re trying to do at the World Bank is recognise that problem and provide extra support for social protection for the poorest in countries, also recognising the agricultural challenges,” he said.

The president welcome countries that are keeping open their export markets, and also countries that are able to change their subsidy systems in order to allow more food availability within their economies during this very challenging time.

Mr. Malpass said that the first priority was saving lives, people’s health, and safety.

That involves procedures that have been widely discussed of social distancing and masks and proper health care if people contract the virus, strengthening of hospital systems and so on. All of those are important, he asserted.

“And then, as we look at the next stage, what I think we can be talking about is that it’s going to be a prolonged downturn for many of the countries, there won’t be as fast a rebound in tourism, for example, as many would like to have,” he said.

There will need to be flexibility in economies, so that people can move to new jobs and positions, and the country can be prepared for a post COVID-19 global economy, Mr. Malpass said.

Acknowledging that it is going to be different from the pre-COVID-19 economy, he noted that one does not know exactly how and that will only evolve over time.

“And so, having countries preserve some of their core industries and businesses, and then keeping families together. We’re providing social safety nets to try to help provide cash grants for people, for example, in Brazil, we have a sizable programme. In Jordan, we support Jordan’s sizable programme and elsewhere around the world, he said.

The World Bank is encouraging countries to spend in the first instance on health programmes, on social programmes, and on education, Malpass said, adding that a critical step for countries is to reopen schools.

“We think there are as many as a billion children still out of school in the developing world. And in those cases, learning goes backward, which has a huge future cost for countries. This is particularly true for girls that are left out at a critical point in their lives, left out of school. That’s a high priority, he said.

Now, looking longer term, infrastructure is a very important part of a country’s growth, he said.

“We have a large undertaking through the IFC that works on infrastructure that helps provide electricity and low carbon ways, for example, that helps provide clean water, that helps provide global public goods, meaning helping the country reach a balance with the environment and with the climate that benefits themselves and their neighbours. All of those are key priorities, he said.

On infrastructure, one of the challenges is they have a very low interest rate environment, and it should be an environment that provides much more infrastructure investment than is currently occurring, Malpass said.

“A key step in this is the documentation and the standardisation of the quality of the infrastructure projects. It’s vital that the world move toward a financing structure where multiple infrastructure projects can be pooled in order to reduce the risk to the entire package, and that’s difficult right now because of the difference in the contracts.

“So, one of the things we’ve wanted to do is try to help standardise some of the contracting and make it much more transparent.

India’s public debt ratio, which remarkably remained stable at about 70% of the GDP since 1991, is projected to jump by 17 percentage points to almost 90% because of an increase in public spending due to COVID-19, the IMF said.

“In our projections, the increase in public spending, in response to COVID-19, and the fall in tax revenue and economic activity, will make public debt jump by 17 percentage points to almost 90% of GDP,” Vitor Gaspar, Director of IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department, told the Press Trust of India.

“Going forward, it is projected to stabilise in 2021, before slowly declining up to the end of the projection period, in 2025. Broadly speaking, the pattern of public debt in India is close to the norm around the world,” he said.

352,2020/10/15,Labour’s data lost,"The government’s tendency to be opaque and blame states is not new

Last month, the Code on Social Security; the Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions; and the Code on Industrial Relations were passed in Parliament with little debate. In August 2019, the Code on Wages was passed. The four codes together subsume more than 40 labour laws.

The mission statement from the Ministry of Labour and Employment reads: “Improving the working conditions and the quality of life of workers through laying down and implementing policies/ programmes/ schemes/ projects for providing social security and welfare measures, regulating conditions of work, occupational health and safety of workers, eliminating child labour from hazardous occupations and processes, strengthening enforcement of labour laws and promoting skill development and employment services”. However, a cogent critique of the labour codes by the Working People’s Charter shows how they contradict the Labour Ministry’s mission statement and lack any social protection measures. Moreover, the Indian Labour Conference (ILC), the apex level consultative committee concerned with labour, last met in 2015. Isn’t it odd that even a nationally constituted body such as the ILC was not consulted before the passage of codes that are going to affect 90% of the workforce? For the nearly 50 crore ‘informal’ workers in India, the codes come as another cruel joke when the embers of the largest crisis for workers have not died down.

Comment | A wage code that is a hasty composition

Lack of data

On September 14, in response to questions in Parliament concerning the deaths of migrant workers during the lockdown, the Labour Minister simply said that no data were available. In an almost prescient move, four researchers — Aman, Kanika, Krushna and Thejesh — had been painstakingly tracking the number of non-COVID deaths since the lockdown was announced. Many surveys have documented the destruction of lives, livelihoods and increased hunger. However, like other independent research was disregarded in the PIL concerning migrant workers in the Supreme Court, these numbers too were disregarded. It is ironic that a government that is obsessed with surveillance purportedly for the welfare of its citizens has not kept track of data that actually matter.

Although the decision to impose a lockdown was dictated by the Central government without any consultation with the State governments, Central government spokespersons were quick to hide behind the veil of federalism. When Stranded Workers Action Network (SWAN) reached out to the Labour Ministry during the lockdown urging it to facilitate the safe passage of migrant workers, we learnt that the workers’ data at the time were very thin. State governments were blamed for it. The script remained unchanged even in Parliament. Given the scale of the crisis, shouldn’t the Labour Ministry have constituted a task force and fast-tracked the collation of such data as soon as the crisis began to unfold?

Neither is the tendency for opacity nor is the tendency to take recourse to federalism new for this government. Take, for instance, the suppression of data on farmer suicides, starvation deaths, and the Consumption Expenditure Survey. Similarly, consider the onslaught on poorer State governments such as Bihar when the Central government refused to pay its share of the GST. The Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act stipulates, among other things, payment of displacement and journey allowance by employers. However, this was not enforced. The order by the Home Ministry (March 29) asking employers to pay employees during the lockdown also stood toothless. Indeed, the Central government violated its own orders by not paying all MGNREGA job card holders as technically the Central government employs them. The fundamental problems will remain unless a deeper introspection of the workforce, skills portfolio and innovation capital is performed. Lax legal enforcement cannot be a justification to whittle them down further.

Comment | The pandemic is about eyes shut

The Indian workforce has consistently depended on so-called ‘casual labour’ for decades. As per the 2017 Economic Survey, there are about 14 crore migrants, half of whom are inter-State workers. Informal workers contribute to nearly 50% of the GDP and inter-State migrant workers contribute to about 6% of the GDP. A majority of the inter-State labourers are self-employed and/or engaged in casual labour with limited opportunities for skill building and increased wages. Despite the threat of automation and mechanisation, the Labour Ministry has sought to focus its skill development initiatives primarily on the formal sector. There is an urgent need to better assess the capabilities and improve the skills of the informal sector as well.

Comment | Listening to the call of the informal

Impact on workers and country

The unacceptably high levels of informal employment have negative impacts not just on the workers but also on the country. First, the informal sector does not provide learning and training opportunities and invests little on their workers, hindering their chances to upgrade. Second, it compounds the existing inequality in the country. It presents itself as a source of income for poor families, whose children often drop out from education to help support their families. In doing so, they halt their own development in formal education or training, leading to sustained low wages. Historically marginalised communities such as Dalits, Muslims, and Adivasis are disproportionately affected by this. Finally, a healthy workforce is a necessary and sufficient condition for a healthy country. From an economic standpoint, a healthy workforce implies higher levels of productivity. And it is an end in itself from a constitutional standpoint.

353,2020/10/15,The RBI tunes in to the economy,"The central bank is showing signs of shifting away from its rigid inflation targeting policy

There is nothing like a crisis to concentrate the mind. The salience of this saying may be found in the changes taking place in the economic policymaking establishments of the world. The COVID-19-triggered recession had led to some of their strongly held assumptions being revised.

Shift away from dogma

Perhaps the most significant of them is the shift indicated by the Chair of the Federal Reserve (Fed), Jerome Powell, declaring that the Fed will not let inflation stand in the way of maximising employment. The practical counterpart of this is that the Fed will no longer raise rates pre-emptively, i.e., in anticipation of inflation. The reason for this, he declared, was that the Phillips Curve, the relationship between inflation and unemployment, may no longer hold in the U.S. economy. Mr. Powell went on to say that he will even be guided by the consideration of unemployment among vulnerable groups within the American population, namely African-Americans and Hispanics. It took a lawyer to call out the emperor. The Phillips Curve has been a mighty presence in the canon of Anglo-American economics.

Yoked as much of India’s economic policymaking has been to intellectual developments in the West one would expect some changes in how our own central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), will change now that the Fed has. We are not disappointed. In the recent reconstitution of the Monetary Policy Committee, which conducts monetary policy in India, we can find a refreshing shift away from dogma. Not all its members may be macro-economists in the conventional sense but their work conveys that they will not be governed by rigid adherence to the model of inflation underlying RBI’s inflation targeting policy. This change has not come a day too early, and India’s government and central bank have done no one any favours by bringing it about. Data show that the model that currently guides India’s inflation control strategy may be quite irrelevant. This is seen in the recent behaviour of inflation. We know that output contracted by more than 23% in the first quarter of this year. Despite this staggering decline the inflation rate did not budge, an experience that flies in the face of the proposition that inflation reflects an ‘over heating’ economy, one growing too fast in relation to its potential. This view represents the RBI’s official understanding of inflation, and presumably forms the basis of its policy of inflation targeting. It was endorsed by the Government of India when it legislated the modern monetary policy framework to enable the RBI to pursue inflation targeting. If the Phillips Curve, which the RBI’s approach internalises, exists, inflation should have abated as India’s economy contracted during the lockdown, implying a ‘cooling off’ as it were.

So far the RBI has shown little time for a handy account of inflation that can explain the recent experience of inflation in India. It had been imagined with developing economies in mind, and is based on the idea that food prices are an important determinant of inflation along with imported inflation. Accordingly, a macroeconomic contraction need not lower inflation.

Model to forecast inflation

A committee somewhere may hardly be sufficient to bring about a change in the mindset of a major arm of the Indian state. Hopefully, though, the economic havoc wreaked by COVID-19 will lead to a more sober and rooted policymaking. We may even be seeing some green shoots. A recent working paper of the RBI’s research department has received attention in the media for suggesting that a more eclectic model than the one that underlies inflation targeting does a better job of forecasting inflation in India. This model accepts a role for food prices, a possibility that is missed when embracing economic models developed in the western hemisphere, where food prices have stopped trending upwards over half a century ago. Better late than never, we might say. That India’s central bank is finally alive to India’s economy is surely good news for Indians.

354,2020/10/15,Tackling the roots of discrimination,"It is imperative to establish both individual culpability and institutional accountability

Ram Vilas Paswan earned many distinctions. He was the only leader to be a Central Minister under six Prime Ministers. His eclecticism in ideology and dexterity in politics could only be a dream for many a politician. Such a feat required of him to be an agnostic in his identity as well. He couldn’t help being a Dalit and he didn’t hide it, either. Being mindful of electoral dynamics, he always sought to represent lower castes, Muslims and, of course, Dalits. His Dalit critics were upset that he clubbed the three groups together for every demand, diluting the ‘uniqueness’ of Dalits.

Leaving aside his first ministerial post as Labour and Welfare Minister, Paswan throughout helmed ‘non-reserved’ ministries such as Railways and Communications. He was as mainstream a national leader as they come. But for most of the media, Paswan died a Dalit. He was a Dalit icon, a Dalit face in the Union Cabinet and what have you.

Also read | Ram Vilas Paswan ‘was the voice of the oppressed, and championed the cause of the marginalised’

Creating pictures in our head

From Ambedkar to Paswan, most of the media clubs Dalits’ caste identity with their accomplishments. But when was the last time the media reported on a national leader as a Brahmin icon or a Bania face? Consider the deleterious effects of such cultural reflex. Sections of the media are complicit in creating and stereotyping what the American abolitionist Frederick Douglass called the “pictures in our head”.

The visual media, especially cinema, is guilty of perpetuating all the dross in society. A recent Telugu movie, Sarileru Neekevvaru, portrays the heroine in a grossly insulting way. As if she is the tail of a monkey, she literally chases the hero till the last frame. In that chase, she stands denuded of agency, dignity, or just decency that is any person’s due. Calling it humour would be a fig leaf to hide sexism. A railway official who must be a graduate, by virtue of his job, is cast as an obese black man capable of generating only derision and laughter.

Here is a movie produced by mostly brown-skinned men; it’s been made for a mostly brown-skinned audience. But the movie stands out also as an essay of the brown man asserting the white man’s supremacy over him. In fact, for example, our age-old infatuation with the white skin explains how, when the actual White Man had showed up on our shores, we had handed him the keys to the country, expressing our habitual obedience.

Three incidents

This year we have witnessed many incidents of violence, inhumanity and blatant discrimination which highlight how the problems of caste, race and gender remain intractable. Let us examine three such incidents.

The murder of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, by a white policeman in the U.S. has forever damaged its reputation as a city on a hill. A female Dalit doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, found the harassment by her upper caste senior so unbearable that she tried to end her life. Fortunately, she failed in the attempt. A Dalit employee of Cisco Systems was discriminated against by upper caste supervisors in the company’s American headquarters and the same is testified by a California government’s lawsuit.

By no means are these acts of cruelty mindless. Nor are they to be ignored as some kind of clash between two parties, where one of them just happened to be from a minority group. The trail of death and destruction these acts leave goes beyond the immediate context. In addition to harming its victim, an act of discrimination does something far more insidious and long-lasting. It reinforces rules, norms and customs that allow or sanction such crimes. We must not forget the wider impact of a case like Floyd’s murder. The damage to the psyche of those millions of young blacks who protest against racism is severe and long-lasting.

The imperative for us is to demand institutional accountability. The ones who should be in the dock are, in addition to the accused, those who head the institutions where acts of discrimination take place. In the AIIMS case, the upper caste senior allegedly told the lady Dalit doctor, “You’re a SC, stay within your limits.”

Comment | Ancient prejudice, modern inequality

The attempted suicide led to the filing of an FIR and AIIMS set up two committees, including an internal one, to investigate the matter. Their brief appears to be to protect the institution’s reputation, rather than standing by the victim even if they found merit in her allegations. The internal committee’s investigation produced this gem: “Although the accused didn’t explicitly use gender or caste-based remarks against the victim, but he did use words like ‘billi’, ‘mind your level’...”

“Mind your level”? What ought to be that level, if her caste and gender were not part of her level? This is how institutions resort to what can be called intentional failures to subvert the laws meant to be invoked in such cases. The obvious reason for AIIMS’s illogic is to obviate the invocation of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 as well as the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act of 2013. These two acts mandate swift action. AIIMS is guilty of making a mockery of the law.

Like a rattlesnake

Therefore, institutions must be made accountable. A simple police investigation would unearth wrongdoing by several top functionaries at AIIMS to subvert the law. The greatest folly would be to treat the matter as an individual case.

Caste and race, like a rattlesnake, distract us by their myriad and daily abominations and we hardly notice their bite. Each act of hatred and violence deserves its own justice. But we must treat them as mere symptoms and look for the real factors that keep hatred and discrimination enduring and pervasive.

355,2020/10/15,Intemperate letter: On Maharashtra Governor’s politics,"The Maharashtra Governor is communalising the government response to the pandemic

Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s intemperate letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, in which he mocked the latter, questioned his faith and even took a jibe at secularism, a fundamental tenet of the Constitution, is disgraceful. His letter, written purportedly to seek an early reopening of temples, could have urged that without the accompanying scorn and derision. The Governor reduced himself to the level of a troll warrior, by declaring that “our gods and goddesses have been condemned to remain in lockdown” and wondering whether the CM has “suddenly turned secular”. He wrote to the CM that the latter used to be a “strong votary of Hindutva”, and cited his visits to temples as proof. This forces the conclusion that the intent, purpose and premise of the letter were all wrong. A person’s faith in Hinduism and its practice is not Hindutva. The Constitution envisages no role for a CM’s faith in his functioning. Moreover, it is not the Governor’s job to interfere in the daily functioning of an elected government. Communication between the Governor and CM must be perfectly civil and respectful besides being constitutionally appropriate. And at any rate, restrictions on gatherings at places of worship as a measure to combat a pandemic are not related to the concept of secularism.

His warped logic apart, Mr. Koshyari has a track record of privileging his political fealties over norms and propriety. In November 2019, he held a swearing-in for BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis as the State’s Chief Minister, in a dubious attempt to pre-empt the formation of a Shiv Sena-led alliance government. He continued to wade into political controversies, in a manner unbecoming of his office. Mr. Thackeray rightly reminded the Governor of the fact that secularism was a “key component” of the Constitution and the need to take care of people while being sensitive to their beliefs and sentiments. Mr. Thackeray also descended into avoidable grandstanding in the letter by reiterating his own Hindutva credentials and revisiting earlier tussles with the Governor. NCP Chief Sharad Pawar on the other hand, called out the Governor’s ill-advised move in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in which he expressed “shock” and “surprise” that the letter was released to the media. The Governor could convey his views to the CM, but the “kind of language” was unsuitable for someone holding a constitutional office, Mr. Pawar pointed out. Maharashtra is fighting a battle against COVID-19, and all steps in this regard must be based entirely on a proper analysis of the situation. Any political considerations can only be damaging, and a communal one will be dangerous. It is unfortunate that the Governor sought to insert himself into the situation in an extremely unhelpful manner. He must retreat and let the Council of Ministers and the Chief Minister take decisions that they consider appropriate and timely.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/intemperate-letter-the-hindu-editorial-on-maharashtra-governor-communalising-government-response-to-pandemic/article32856514.ece
356,2020/10/15,Unpleasant spectacle: On A.P. CM’s complaint against Supreme Court judge,"The tussle between State govt. and High Court in A.P. should not be allowed to escalate

The sudden escalation of an ongoing tussle between the judiciary and the ruling YSR Congress party in Andhra Pradesh makes for an unpleasant spectacle. The limits of propriety are being stretched, as the allegations being bandied about have taken distinctly political overtones. With the CM, Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, writing to the Chief Justice of India, S.A. Bobde, complaining about the allegedly hostile attitude of the Andhra Pradesh High Court against him and his government, and making public details of the letter that contains explosive allegations against a serving Supreme Court judge, the conflict is embarrassingly out in the open. Meanwhile, the High Court has directed the CBI to take over the investigation into the registry’s complaints against allegedly defamatory, inciting and derogatory social media posts against the judiciary as well as individual judges, and to examine whether these attacks were part of a larger conspiracy. The CM alleges that the High Court is being controlled by loyalists of his predecessor in office and political rival, N. Chandrababu Naidu, and has passed a slew of orders against his regime and its actions. The High Court, the petitioner on the administrative side, argues that not only is the State police reluctant to take action against those carrying on an online campaign against the court but it is actively pursuing complaints of similar offences against Mr. Jagan Mohan and arresting the perpetrators. It says many of those posting on social media against the High Court judges are from the YSR Congress.

The conflict is based on mutual accusations that the High Court is hostile to the State government, and that the latter is abetting a political campaign against the judges. It is disturbing enough that some judicial orders are seen in a political light, or lend themselves to such an interpretation. It becomes quite ominous if these charges give rise to open threats and abuse. The government has sought to ease the situation by offering no objection to the CBI inquiry. It is presumably waiting for the outcome of the CM’s unusual missive to the CJI, who in turn faces a dilemma as he cannot be seen as either ignoring a written complaint from an elected leader or giving undue credence to charges from a disgruntled litigant. The problem is that allegations of possible judicial bias, which are difficult to establish, are combined with those of misconduct, a serious charge. The right thing would probably be for the CJI to order an inquiry into the letter in accordance with the apex court’s internal procedure. Regardless of what happens, it may end the recriminations. India can ill-afford a public perception that judges have strong political loyalties. For, that will undermine faith in an independent judiciary.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unpleasant-spectacle-the-hindu-editorial-on-jagan-mohan-reddys-complaint-against-supreme-court-judge/article32856516.ece

“Initial investigations have revealed that the duo wanted to send the consignment out of the country, probably to Nepal, to get it exchanged for legal tender,” said a police officer.

The police have taken Vijay and Shivakumar into custody and are on the hunt for their associate, Yogesh, who escaped.

“We are also investigating the source of the money,” the officer added.

In past cases, those arrested believed that they could exchange old notes for legal currency in Nepal. A few days ago, the city police arrested two men and recovered demonetised currency notes, which they wanted to send to Nepal.

“We have checked with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Nowhere are these notes accepted for exchange,” Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant had told The Hindu at the time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/demonetised-currency-seized/article32865887.ece
358,2020/10/15,"Despite recent surge in cases in Bengaluru, positivity rate drops","This is gleaned from data of the last four weeks

Most of the city’s eight zones have reported a drop in both positivity rate and fatality rate of COVID-19 cases over the last four weeks, reveals data that Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) presented to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Wednesday. This trend was observed despite a spike in cases since the start of October.

Bommanahalli, Mahadevapura, Dasarahalli and Yelahanka have recorded a very sharp drop in positivity rates, some nearly dropping by half in a span of four weeks. Only the East zone recorded a slight increase in positivity rate from 11.78% to 12.4% during the same period. However, the East Zone saw its fatality rate fall by more than half, dropping from a high of 1.9% to 0.84%.

While most zones had recorded fatality rates above 1% four weeks ago, all eight have fatality rates below 1% as on October 12. Dasarahalli Zone registered a marginal increase of fatality rate from 0.8% to 0.87%.

The drop would have been much sharper, if not for the rise in the number of cases over the last two weeks, sources say. Civic officials attributed the recent spike to an increase in testing, which has almost doubled in four weeks.

“The drop observed in both positivity and fatality rates even as we have ramped up testing shows that the city is slowly turning the tide,” said BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad.

He attributed the recent spike and Bengaluru reporting over 5,000 daily cases more than once to better monitoring. “We have ramped up testing, and it is good that we are catching more cases,” he said.

Four weeks ago, the city was testing 22900 people on an average per day. The number has now almost doubled and stands at around 45,600.

However, BBMP data shows that no zone achieved the target for the number of more reliable but tedious RT-PCR tests, but every zone has overshot its target for the less reliable but instant RAT tests. “We have now decided to increase the proportion of RT-PCR tests further and rely less on RAT tests,” Mr. Prasad said.

Civic officials also attribute the drop in positivity and fatality rates to contact tracing, which had taken a back seat in the city for a while.

“Earlier, primary contacts of positive patients would be reluctant to be tested, unless they had symptoms. But now, as patients can stay under home isolation, they are willing to get tested earlier. This is partly responsible for the high positivity rate,” C. Nagaraj, Director of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases and a member of the State Task Force, told The Hindu a few days ago.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/i0iguk/article32848689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGCOVID1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/despite-recent-surge-in-cases-in-bengaluru-positivity-rate-drops/article32865629.ece
359,2020/10/15,"Smart City road work not so ‘smart’, say frustrated citizens","Motorists and cyclists allege that dug-up roads are a safety hazard

It’s not just motorists who are being inconvenienced by the road work taken up by Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. in the Central Business District (CBD), which is moving at a snail’s pace. Residents and businesses too are facing the brunt as the constant digging has affected power and telephone lines.

A motorist, who commutes from Nagarbhavi to Infantry Road every day, said, “There seems to be no planning. Utilities, such as telephone lines and power lines, often get affected. The projects are ‘smart’ only in name.”

Motorists and cyclists allege that the dug-up roads are a safety hazard.

“On many stretches, roads have been dug up on both sides. The barricades are not sturdy. If we lose control of the vehicle, we will fall straight into a ditch,” said a motorist.

Former mayor M. Goutham Kumar, who received complaints from frustrated citizens, said he had issued several directions during his tenure with regard to safety measures to be taken at the work site. “So far, none of the directions seem to have been implemented,” he said, adding that none of the projects taken up were progressing as per deadlines.

M. Shivaraju, former councillor, said the lack of information in the public domain about the projects and their status is another source of frustration. “How much money has been sanctioned, what has been spent, when are the works likely to be completed… all these details should be made available to the general public,” he said.

Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. Managing Director Hephsiba Rani Korlapati vehemently refuted claims of lack of safety measures. Projects estimated at ₹1,000 crore have been envisaged under Smart City. Of this, the Centre will sanction ₹500 crore over five years, and the rest will come from the State government.

“So far, the Centre has sanctioned ₹155 crore and the State government has released ₹55 crore. Of this, we have already spent around ₹75 crore. Around ₹65 crore has been spent since February this year,” she pointed out.

Admitting that work progress had been affected following the lockdown and exodus of migrant workers, she said that the pace of work has picked up since August. “Till January this year, many of the projects had not been taken up on the ground. However, we are now on fast-track mode and we are sure to complete the projects within the deadlines,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/o9adzt/article32865573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGWORKSP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/smart-city-road-work-not-so-smart-say-frustrated-citizens/article32865575.ece
360,2020/10/15,"Daily Namma Metro ridership crosses 56,000","Passengers must use smart card within 60 days from the date of recharge, says BMRCL

Since the resumption of Namma Metro services a little over a month ago, ridership has gradually increased reaching 56,000 on October 12, but is yet to reach the pre-COVID-19 level when around four lakh commuters were using the mass transit system every day.

When services resumed on September 7 on the Purple Line, ridership was only around 3,700. Now, the number of people using Namma Metro has crossed 56,000.

Yeshwanth Chavan, Chief PRO of BMRCL, said they are operating 271 round trips on both lines every day.

On the Purple Line (Mysuru Road to Baiyappanahalli), 135 trips are being operated using 21 trains. On the Green Line (Yelachenahalli to Nagasandra), BMRCL is operating 136 trips using 25 trains.

“To contain the spread of COVID-19, we are operating trains as per the SoP issued by the government. Ridership remains low compared to pre-lockdown days as companies have asked employees to work from home and educational institutions are closed,” he said.

BMRCL has released a video on social media to create awareness and educate commuters on the safety precautions in place.

Raghava S., a regular commuter, said, “In the early days, the coaches were practically empty. Gradually, the number of passengers began increasing. BMRCL should make sure that SoPs are strictly followed by deploying more security staff on platforms.”

A.S. Shankar, executive director (operations) of BMRCL, said that staff have been instructed to identify and warn passengers who fail to wear masks properly or follow social distancing rules. “Passengers have to sanitise their hands before entering stations. They are screened at the entrance, and those who have fever are not allowed to enter,” he said.

Card validity

BMRCL, in a press release issued on Thursday, stated that passengers who recharge their smart cards online and fail to produce them at automatic ticket gates within seven days, can now approach the ‘Customer Care’ at stations for validation of the card (credit of the top-up amount).

Passengers have to bring their smart cards to the customer care counter along with proof of online top-up. However, passengers should use the card at least once within 60 days (from the date of recharge) after the top-up amount has been credited. If they fail to do so, the transaction will lapse.

“In the interest of commuter safety, BMRCL notifies that all commuters who initiate recharge through website, BMRCL‘s mobile app or Karnataka Mobile One shall present their cards within seven days of payment initiation, so that metro travel will be by contactless payments. Approaching customer care for effecting top-up involves manual interaction, which is to be avoided as far as possible and resorted to only if unavoidable, in view of the pandemic,” said the release.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/utt23u/article32865548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGMETROP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/daily-namma-metro-ridership-crosses-56000/article32865550.ece

362,2020/10/15,"Civic body using app for ABC, ARV programmes","The BBMP is probably the first corporation in the State to do so

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has taken up mass Anti Rabies Vaccination (ARV) and Animal Birth Control (ABC) programmes in two wards. What is new is that both programmes are being implemented on a pilot basis with some technological help from an app.

BBMP’s Joint Director (Animal Husbandry) Lakshminarayana Swamy told The Hindu that the programmes were being implemented in Nagarbhavi in West zone and Herohalli in Rajarajeshwarinagar zone. The civic officials were using an app developed by World Wide Veterinary Services Centre, Goa.

“The app has been helpful to geotag stray dogs,” the official said and added that 384 dogs had been sterilised in Nagarbhavi ward and over 1,800 in Herohalli ward.

Another official S.M.M. Shinde said that the BBMP was probably the first corporation in the State to make use of the app for implementation of the ABC and ARV programmes. “Once a dog is caught for the ABC and ARV, it will be geotagged. After taking a photo of the stray dog, we will input all details about the animal, such as whether it is a puppy, male or female, colour, whether it is neutered.,” he said.

He said geotagging of the location also helps the civic body and animal welfare organisations in releasing the stray dogs after sterilisation. It is mandatory, as per animal rights norms, to release the animal in the same location from where it was caught.

The app also helps the civic body with better documentation.

Late last year, the city finally had an idea of the stray dog population. The dog census revealed that there were 3.09 lakh stray dogs, of which only 54.24%, i.e. 1.68 lakh, had been neutered. The census showed that the stray dog population was more in the five outer zones of Mahadevapura, Rajarajeshwarinagar, Dasarahalli, Bommanahalli and Yelahanka. In these five zones, the stray dog population was pegged at 1.97 lakh.

“Since the app was used for dog census, we also know where the stray dog population is more. This will help in launching targeted programmes in these areas and localities,” Dr. Shinde said and added that if the pilot is successful, it would be extended to all wards in the city.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/civic-body-using-app-for-abc-arv-programmes/article32864454.ece

Ms. Ammajamma, who has studied up to class 5, has a 30-year lease in her name for quarrying grey granite and has 1.2 kg of gold jewellery.

The former Minister and senior Congress leader T.B. Jayachandra, who is contesting from Sira, has declared assets — movable and immovable — worth about ₹22.43 crore, which includes assets in the name of his wife G.H. Nirmala.

Several party workers, who called themselves “committed workers of the BJP”, publicly raised objection at a party meeting in the constituency against the party’s decision to field Mr. Munirathna, who migrated from the Congress. They shouted slogans in favour of party leader Tulsi Muniraju Gowda, who had unsuccessfully contested the previous elections against Mr. Munirathna. The vociferous BJP workers alleged that the party leadership had “let them down” by not consulting local workers before deciding on the ticket.

It may be noted that the BJP had traditional political rivalry with Mr. Munirathna as he was the political opponent in the constituency for more than a decade. Also, Mr. Gowda had fought for getting party ticket till the last minute. However, the party top leadership finally preferred Mr. Munirathna as he had quit his Assembly membership he won on the Congress ticket to help the BJP come to power in the State.

366,2020/10/15,BMTC introduces 12-hour shift to cut operational cost,"With old eight-hour shifts cancelled, bus crew get 3 to 4-hour breaks but no overtime pay

The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), which is losing crores of rupees every day because of poor riderhip, has cancelled traditional eight-hour shifts for conductors and drivers as a cost-cutting measure. Instead, it has asked the bus crew to follow a 12-hour shift with one break for as long as three to four hours. Drivers and conductors are not happy with the new rules as it means they will have to forgo overtime pay.

However, BMTC officials have justified the decision on the grounds that services have reduced drastically. Prior to the lockdown, over 35 lakh people used to travel in buses every day, but this has reduced to around 15 lakh.

“Schools and colleges have remained closed and companies are allowing employees to work from home. This has resulted in lower demand for our buses during morning hours. Earlier, our conductors and drivers worked in two shifts, such as 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. Now, we have introduced a general shift of 12 hours from 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. depending on the routes,” said a BMTC official.

Arguing that the longer shift will have a negative impact on their efficiency, drivers and conductors have asked the management to reconsider its decision. “Earlier, anything beyond eight hours would be considered as overtime, and we would get paid extra. But now they have extended the general shift to 12 hours without any overtime,” an employee said.

Another BMTC driver said the three-hour break is counterproductive. “Spending three to four without doing anything will not help. I am hoping that once everything gets normalised, the management will bring the old shift back,” he said.

Refuting claims that long shifts are against the rules, a senior BMTC official said the new system was introduced as per the Motor Transport Workers Act.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/wdccg2/article32857680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGDEPOTP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bmtc-introduces-12-hour-shift-to-cut-operational-cost/article32857681.ece

The CM, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, Health Minister K. Sudhakar, and Ministers in-charge of various zones reviewed the measures taken in the city to control the spread of COVID-19. One of the issues addressed was complaints about middlemen charging exorbitant sums from those who have tested positive for COVID-19 seeking beds in hospitals and fake bills being submitted in the name of patients under home quarantine/isolation. Officials concerned were directed to check this and take corrective action immediately.

Nearly 55% of the people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are under home isolation. BBMP officials were also directed to improve contact tracing. However, they reported that either the addresses of many primary and secondary contacts were incorrect or their mobile phones were switched off.

Directions have already been issued to increase the number of RT-PCR tests and reduce RAT.

369,2020/10/15,‘Election cost is likely to be 50% more than average’,"Elections to the Legislative Council and bypolls to the Assembly being held amid pandemic will mean several additional costs in terms of personnel and equipment

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Karnataka is set for elections to four Legislative Council seats and byelections to Rajarajeshwarinagar and Sira Assembly constituencies. While the Election Commission is making arrangements, there have been misgivings in political circles about the conduct of elections during these testing times. In an interview, Chief Electoral Officer Sanjiv Kumar explained the precautions being put in place and said that it is a “challenging task to conduct elections keeping everyone safe”. Excerpts:

What measures are being initiated by the Election Commission amid the pandemic?

Apart from having thermal scanners and sanitisers at every booth, we are identifying bigger rooms that have enough natural light and air to have polling stations. EVMs and VVPAT units will be sanitised. The number of voters in each polling booth has been reduced from 1,500 earlier to 1,000 now to limit crowding.

Will there be new systems in place?

Low-cost pens that can be discarded after single use will be used in the Council elections as ballot papers are still used. In the byelections, a small rubber cover for the finger to be used to press the EVM button will be distributed. All these to reduce contact spreading of the pandemic. For the first time, a nodal health officer has been appointed to coordinate between the EC and the State Disaster Management Authority.

How will a COVID-19 positive vote?

The last one hour of voting will be reserved for COVID-19 positives and those suspected to have the infection. Tokens will be issued if a person is found to have above normal temperature during the thermal scanning and they can vote in this hour. Polling officials will wear the personal protection equipment (PPE). Additionally, in the byelections, persons with disabilities, those aged above 80 and COVID-19 positives have been given the provision to exercise postal ballot, provided they register within five days after the notification is issued.

How will political party workers be monitored for COVID-19 safety?

The number of vehicles in a convoy has been reduced from 10 to five. Election meetings should adhere to State and EC guidelines. For outdoor political rallies, officials will mark the places for people to stand by maintaining distance. Online nomination facility has been extended.

Has the cost of conducting elections gone up owing to various measures?

The election cost is likely to be 50% more than the average cost. On average, about ₹2 crore was spent on each constituency in 2018. The cost has increased as there will be more polling booths, more rooms for counting votes as there will be only seven counting tables per room, more people to conduct elections, more vehicles, and additional expenditure on the PPEs, among others.

Despite these efforts do you expect a good turnout of voters?

This is an unexplored area and depends on the political mobilisation. We are expecting normal voting.",,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/fg7325/article32857977.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGSANJIVKUMARCHIEFELECTIONCOMMISSIONER,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/election-cost-is-likely-to-be-50-more-than-average/article32857978.ece

The COVID-19 lockdown has had an adverse effect on many lives, but few have put up a fight to convert the situation in their favour.

One such person is 24-year-old K. Kuhan, a State-level volleyball player and aspiring police officer who is now selling tripods on the road to feed his family and save for his higher education.

As one rides past the New Avadi Road, it is easy to miss Mr. Kuhan, a bearded youngster selling tripods on the platform near the Regional Transport Office.

Every morning around 8.30 a.m he sets up shop and sells tripods till 8.30 p.m. He says when there was a huge demand initially for the online classes, he used to earn ₹500 per day. But now his business has dwindled as the equipment is available everywhere.

“I did my under graduation in D.B. Jain college and have a few arrears to clear as I used to work to support my family. I have played volleyball at State level and have taken part in school nationals and youth nationals. I have also represented my college,” says Mr. Kuhan.

His mother Rekha Kumar, has been struggling to make ends meet after her husband’s death. “She works as a coffee maker in a company and she only took care of our education. Now my brother K. Jagan has finished his under graduation. and wants to pursue higher education. Hence I decided to work, save money for our education and run the family. We don’t want our mother to struggle anymore,” he adds.

Even when is attending to business, he prepares for the police constable recruitment. “I have tried twice earlier, but was not successful. But I will keep trying. I also desire to purse a course in physical education alongside the preparation,” he explains.

R. Desingurajan, physical director of D B Jain COllege and Madras University volleyball coach vouches for him. “He got college admission in sports quota and has been the college team captain. But his family’s monetary situation is bad. So he was struggling,” he says.

Mr. Kuhan says he has played the attacker position on the field. “In life too I shall attack and play and will bow down to adversities,” he says before attending to a customer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/eeyigo/article32860595.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/volley,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/he-fights-adversities-on-the-field-and-in-life/article32860596.ece

D’Cruz, director, Oncology Services, Apollo Cancer Centre, who has been elected as president of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), Geneva.

Dr. D’Cruz, who was on the UICC board of directors for six years, according to a press release, is the first Indian oncologist to be directly elected by member organisations as its president. He said the UICC was the largest voice of cancer control and has 1,200 members across 172 countries. Various academic institutions, agencies and NGOs are part of the UICC, which works to unite and support the community, reduce the global burden of cancer, promote greater equity, improve control and see that the disease continues to stay on the world health and developmental agenda.

“We must realise that cancer is growing in our country.We now have figures of about 100 to 110 per 100,000 population as opposed to the developed world where it is about 350 per 100,000 population. But we must realise that our population pyramid is so structured that the majority of our countrymen are less than the age of 30. As our population grows older and lifestyles improve, the incidence of cancer will also increase,” he told reporters on Wednesday.

“While a lot of high-end hospitals are coming up, I believe we also have to strengthen primary healthcare. We must put emphasis on early detection, prevention and this should straddle all non-communicable diseases (NCD) and not just cancer in isolation. If NCDs can be screened early, we can prevent a lot of problems,” he said.

He said the three commonest cancers in India were those of the head and neck, breast and cervix. “About 30% of the cancers are head and neck, predominantly because of tobacco use,” Dr. D’Cruz said. “Unfortunately, 80% of patients at present are in stage-3 and stage-4. If we have patients coming at an early stage, the success rate of the cure is upwards of 90%. These three cancers are preventable if accessible to detected early,” he added.

Prathap C. Reddy, chairman, Apollo Hospitals Group, highlighted the need to create infrastructure in the country which was on a par with the rest of the world so that people need not go abroad for treatment.

Noting that NCDs such as heart diseases, cancer, diabetes and stroke accounted for 80% of deaths, he stressed on early detection to save lives.

372,2020/10/15,Petrol bomb hurled at house in Teynampet,"Six motorcycles and portion of building damaged; police arrest two suspects, search on for five others

Miscreants hurled petrol bombs at a house in Teynampet belonging to a person who informed the police about ganja smokers near his home. Six motorcycles, two bicycles and a portion of the house were torched in the incident.

Two suspects have been apprehended and the police, after registering a case, are searching for their accomplices. The police said complainant Ashok Kumar, 28, a chef in a star hotel, was living in Thiru Vi Ka Kudiyiruppu in Teynampet.

He used to encounter a gang that loitered around Dr. Thomas Road and smoked ganja. On Tuesday, he spotted them near his residence and reprimanded them for trespassing.

This resulted in a scuffle, and the gang manhandled him. Mr. Kumar was rescued by neighbours; later, he informed the Teynampet police about the gang.

Angered by this, the gang returned and threw petrol bombs at Mr. Kumar’s home in the early hours of Wednesday. Six bikes, two bicycles and the front door were damaged.

Alerted by neighbours, Fire and Rescue Services personnel arrived and put out the fire, while the police apprehended two suspects, Abi and Joshuva, and are searching for five others.

Ganja sellers held

In another incident, the Anna Salai police arrested Hussain, 40, of Chemmanchery, for carrying ganja in an auto.

A special team, which was conducting routine checks at the junction connecting Amir Mahal Lane and Perumal Mudali Street, intercepted the vehicle and recovered 1.1 kg ganja.

The Korukkupet police arrested three persons near Kannan Road for possessing and using narcotics. They arrested Narendran alias Thappa Narendran, 27, Sathish Kumar alias Thadi Sathish, 28, of Korukkupet, and G. Srikanth, 24, of Andhra Pradesh.

The SRM Institute of Science and Technology will provide free education to 300 meritorious students.

This is the second consecutive year that the institute’s founder-chancellor Paarivendhar announced the decision. It was one of his poll promises in 2019. Mr. Paarivendhar was elected MP from Perambalur in 2019.

A formal letter will be sent to each student, and the names of selected students will be displayed on the SRM website as well. The students will be admitted to programmes of their choice — engineering, agriculture, arts and science.

The MP met Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and sought a railway line via Ariyalur-Perambalur-Thuraiyur-Namakkal.

He also met Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, who said the first survey for the railway line would be taken up shortly.

Mr. Paarivendhar also asked for the construction of a railway bridge at Kulithalai-Manapparai, bringing residual Cauvery water to Panjapatti lake through a canal and setting up of a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Lalgudi and Kulithalai. He has also made a request for cold storage facilities for small onion farmers in Turaiyur and Perambalur.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/300-students-will-get-free-education-at-srm/article32857653.ece

The Ayanavaram police have filed an FIR on a complaint from Scripture Union against two suspended staff for sending inappropriate text messages to school girls.

J. Joshua Kirubaraj, national director, Scripture Union & Children Special Service Mission Council of India, lodged a complaint with the Police Commissioner last week. The organisation is actively involved in teaching children about biblical values and principles in schools.

The complainant said on August 4, they had received an oral complaint from a girl and her father from Vellore about inappropriate text messages that one of their field staff, Samuel Jaisunder, had allegedly sent her.

Upon investigating, the organisation learned that Jaisunder and another staff member, Reuben Clement, had both sent inappropriate messages to girl students on social media. Both were suspended from the organisation.

375,2020/10/15,Leakage in water pipeline causes flooding on Chennai-Tiruvllur High Road,"Officials of the Metrowater said the leak in the pipeline would be attended to.

A portion of the arterial Chennai Tiruvallur Road (CTH) at Ambattur was flooded on Wednesday as a drinking water pipeline had developed a leak.

Drinking water was going waste for the past two or three days due to the damage in the pipeline near Ambattur telephone exchange, said the residents.

S.Vijayan, a resident of Ambattur, said water-logging due to the leak had slowed down traffic on the road.

The pipeline in the locality developed a similar leak earlier this month and was repaired. Such frequent repairs also damaged the road, he said. Residents wanted the Chennai Metrowater authorities to take measures to prevent the problem.

Officials of the Metrowater said the leak in the pipeline would be attended to. It was one of the pipelines carrying water to Kilpauk water works. The facility at Kilpauk received water from Red Hills and Chembarambakkam treatment plants and water is distributed to various areas from there.

The pipeline that travels through CTH Road carried water from Red Hills treatment plant, which has a capacity to treat 300 million litres of water a day, to Kilpauk. “As it travelled through main road, it often faced the risk of damages due to movement of heavy vehicles. We will complete the work within a day,” said an official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9vy2x6/article32857602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THMETROWATERLEAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/leakage-in-water-pipeline-causes-flooding-on-chennai-tiruvllur-high-road/article32857603.ece
376,2020/10/15,CBI books energy firm for defrauding bank,"The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a case against a city-based energy firm and its directors/former directors in connection with an alleged fraud that caused the Punjab National Bank losses to the tune of ₹15.46 crore.

Acting on a complaint lodged by PNB’s assistant general manager Surinder Kumar Sethi, the agency’s Anti-Corruption Branch registered a case on charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating, read with provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, against Infinitas Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd., its directors N. Ramkhumar Narasimhan and Poorani Nagarajan, former directors Ramakrishnan Srinivasan, Vathsala Ranganathan and Anantha Rama Krishnan — all residents of Chennai — and other unknown associates, private persons and public servants.

The company, promoted by VRONCE Energy (a subsidiary of Shriram Auto Finance), represented through its directors, had availed itself of a fund-based loan of ₹1 crore and a non-fund based facility of ₹30 crore in 2011. As on January 31, 2020, the facility limits, book outstanding stood at ₹15.46 crore and the total memoranda dues to the bank was ₹35.91 crore.

The CBI said in its FIR that the accused defrauded the bank by diverting and siphoning off public funds to the tune of ₹15.46 crore, apart from interest. Though the liquidation process was on, a forensic audit revealed indications that fraudulent transactions had taken place in the account. It was observed that the company made no efforts for recoverability, which was against the normal industry practice, and hence, prima facie genuineness and correctness of balances of debtors were doubtful. The company also availed itself of credit facilities from other banks that were members of the consortium.

It was alleged that the company represented by its directors prepared and submitted forged documents (financial statements) as genuine for diverting funds. Amid suspected diversion of funds and transfer of assets etc., the account was declared as fraud by the bank.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cbi-books-energy-firm-for-defrauding-bank/article32857353.ece
377,2020/10/15,2.5 lakh acres in Tamil Nadu identified as panchami land,"‘Figure is provisional as there is a lack of consensus; reconciliation under way’

Approximately 2.5 lakh acres in the State are said to have been identified as panchami land, according to officials involved in the exercise.

Pointing out that the figure is only provisional, the officials said there is a lack of consensus within the bureaucracy on the matter. As there is a view that the real extent of panchami land is more than what has been arrived at, reconciliation is under way with regard to land database in the districts, the officials added.

Of the identified land, nearly 30% is reported to have been occupied by persons other than Scheduled Castes (SCs).

On this aspect too, there seems to be no unanimity among the officials.

Originally, when the British administration devised the scheme of assignment of panchami land in the late 19th century, it gave away 12 lakh acres to landless SCs in Madras Presidency, which included Andhra Pradesh and parts of Kerala, Karnataka and Odisha, apart from Tamil Nadu.

The exact figure of the current extent of panchami land in the State has been an elusive matter. Following a government order issued in July 1991, the authorities reportedly found 85,000 acres of panchami land, after which the exercise was abandoned.

In 2006, the Office of the Commissioner of Land Administration (CLA) told an RTI (Right to Information Act) petitioner that around 1.26 lakh acres of panchami land were available, of which about 10,620 acres were held by non-SCs.

Acknowledging that the retrieval of land held by non-SCs would be a bigger challenge than the identification of land, officials said the work on drafting a law is still under way.

Referring to the constitution of a panel by the State government in 2015 for land identification, I. Pandiyan, a Madurai-based activist and founder of Witness for Justice, a rights-based organisation, said that what is required is a special cell for expediting the work.

In addition to the perusal of existing documents, the cell can hold regional-level hearings and collect information, he said.

Reclassification of castes

As for the issue of the re-categorisation of six castes, now included in the SC list as Devendra Kula Vellalar, officials pointed out that a committee constituted in March 2019 is yet to submit its report.

At the same time, they said that if the castes — Kudumban, Pallan, Devendrakulathan, Kadaiyan, Pannadi and Kalladi — are to be given the generic name of Devendra Kula Vellalar, the consent of the Central government is required as this will involve an addition to the list.

The officials explain that the given case cannot be equated with that of Arunthathiyars.

In respect of the latter, there was no addition to the Schedule, and seven castes were clubbed in 2009 under the term Arunthathiyar, one of the castes in the SC list, for the purpose of providing 3% reservation within the overall 18% quota.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/25-lakh-acres-in-tamil-nadu-identified-as-panchami-land/article32857279.ece
378,2020/10/15,A weak link in the elementary education chain,"India is ignoring the necessity for strong capacity building of the many NGOs engaged in educational improvement

For about three decades now, a large number of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are intensively engaged in the task of improving elementary education in the country. A paper in the Economic & Political Weekly of May 2005, titled How Large Is India’s Non-Profit Sector?, estimates about three million paid workers in the voluntary sector through 1.2 million organisations. The paper estimates that 20.4% of this workforce (about 6 lakh workers) is engaged in education. According to a newspaper report, “India has 31 lakh NGOs, more than double the number of schools” (August 1, 2015), the number of NGOs in the country was more than 31 lakh — more than double the number estimated in the above mentioned paper. With these data, it should be a safe guess to estimate that there are now more than 12 lakh NGO workers engaged in education (even if there could be only 50% of them in school education, and the remainder involved in improving reach and quality). The lower end of the estimated number of NGO staff working for the improvement of quality and reach in elementary education must be over three lakh.

Scope of work

It is most probable that these workers are engaged in direct teaching in classrooms, demonstrating various activities and methods to teachers, conducting teacher workshops and so on. Most NGOs and large foundations believe that these people work as catalysts and influence the functioning of the system. For various reasons, they are supposed to be more effective than regular employees in the government system.

There is a lot of discussion around education and the Continuous Professional Development of Teachers (CPDT). These NGO workers have a significant part in the CPDT, for example, in annual in-service training and pedagogy improvement workshops. We should be asking ourselves whether these workers are adequately prepared for this difficult task. As an example, let us take quality improvement, which is currently the biggest concern in education.

Anyone who can successfully contribute to the improvement of educational quality must have some idea of what educational quality happens to be. A very common notion of what good quality school is in our society is based on a high score in the board examinations. Suppose the curriculum is irrelevant to the life of people (as it is often claimed), would it still indicate high quality? Further, suppose that high scoring is achieved by subjecting children to severe punishment and stress, would it still remain an indicator of high quality? If the response to last two questions is negative, then we can conclude that appropriateness of curriculum and pedagogy also need to be considered in defining quality of education. But how do we know what good or appropriate curriculum and pedagogy are? On what criteria can we decide that?

Key documents, framework

The four documents currently providing a framework of principles, guidelines and legal stipulations to deal with such questions are the National Curriculum Framework 2005 (NCF), The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE), the National Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education 2009 (NCFTE) and the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020). Even if the NCF and NCFTE change in the near future, the new documents are likely to have much in common with the present ones. Therefore, it is worthwhile to assume that any worker engaged in education improvement should reasonably understand these and similar documents. Let us take an example from each one of these documents to see what is involved.

Regarding pedagogy, the RTE, in Section 29(e), recommends “learning through activities, discovery and exploration in a child friendly and child-centered manner”. To use this definition in school improvement, the NGO worker has to ask himself questions such as : What is discovery? How and what can children learn through discovery? Does discovery method have any limitations as a pedagogy? Further, the NCF recommends constructivist pedagogy. What is the constructivist method of learning? Is it the same as recommended by the NCF?

On curriculum, NEP 2020, paragraph 4.23 says “certain subjects, skills, and capacities should be learned by all students to become good, successful, innovative, adaptable, and productive human beings in today’s rapidly changing world. … these skills include: scientific temper and evidence-based thinking; creativity and innovativeness; sense of aesthetics and art; oral and written communication; health and nutrition; physical education, fitness, wellness, and sports; collaboration and teamwork; problem solving and logical reasoning; vocational exposure and skills; digital literacy, coding, and computational thinking; ethical and moral reasoning; knowledge and practice of human and Constitutional values; gender sensitivity; Fundamental Duties; citizenship skills and values”.

If we want to use this policy, we need to understand what paragraphs such as the above say. One has to note the complexity and profusion of terms used. What do all these words and phrases mean? Is the paragraph internally consistent? Is this paragraph consistent with the NCF? Do the NCF and NEP need to be consistent with each other?

The paragraph from NEP 2020 also highlights certain aims of education: namely, to make all children “good, successful, innovative, adaptable, and productive human beings in today’s rapidly changing world”. Are these aims consistent with each other? Do they have any relative weightage? What if some schools produce children who are highly successful, innovative, adaptable, productive, extremely competitive, and uncaring for others? Would we be happy to call them “good” and consider such an education to be high quality education?

The last example, the NCFTE (page 23), says that we need teachers who “[P]romote values of peace, democratic way of life, equality, justice, liberty, fraternity, secularism and zeal for social reconstruction”. Are these two quotes, one from NEP 2020 and the other from the NCFTE, compatible with each other? Are they emphasising the same values or have significant difference with each other?

Need for deep insights

It seems bringing about improvement in the quality of education is not a simple task that one can accomplish just by desire, hard work and interaction with teachers. It seems to require answers to a plethora of questions. Could it be that our attempts for over three decades have failed, at least partly, because most people working for improvement do not have reasonable answers to such questions?

Just reading these documents may be adequate for a layman not engaged in educational activities and teacher capacity building. But for someone engaged in CPDT, a study of these documents alone will neither answer the questions raised above nor give him/her any better insight into these documents. The positions taken in these and other such documents, as well as in decision making in education, are based on a vast repertoire of theoretical knowledge. A major part of this theoretical knowledge is drawn from the philosophy of education, political theories, sociology of education, psychology of learning and development, and a contextual understanding of the current needs of our society. Understanding an adequate part of all this and their implications for curriculum, pedagogy, and teacher development, therefore, becomes imperative to be effective in quality improvement or to contribute to good education.

An immediate task

If the argument outlined so far is even tentatively acceptable, then a strong programme for capacity building of NGO workers engaged in educational improvement becomes an urgent need.

However, NGOs do not seem to be paying adequate attention to this very important area. Nor do universities and teacher education colleges seem to be offering any short term and/or distance learning courses for this sector. If we want to implement NEP 2020 — presently leaving its merits and demerits aside — and really want to see improvement in the quality of education available to our children, we need to pay very close attention to capacity building of this vast workforce engaged in the field. Without adequate preparation, the assumption that the mere appointment of a person in an NGO and being placed in the field will automatically develop the capabilities of these workers is incorrect, and a case of sheer injustice to them, to the education system, and to children in schools.

379,2020/10/15,Phased manufacturing policy that is hardly smart,"Largely applicable to the mobile phone manufacturing sector, the plan has fared poorly in domestic value addition

Last week, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) said it had approved 16 firms in the mobile manufacturing sector for the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme (for large-scale electronics manufacturing, notified on April 1, 2020) to transform India into a major mobile manufacturing hub. These are five domestic and five foreign mobile phone producers and six component manufacturers. The PLI comes on the back of a phased manufacturing programme (PMP) that began in 2016-17 and was supposed to culminate in 2019-20. The PMP incentivised the manufacture of low value accessories initially, and then moved on to the manufacture of higher value components. This was done by increasing the basic customs duty on the imports of these accessories or components. The PMP was implemented with an aim to improve value addition in the country.

More imports in India

Firms such as Apple, Xiaomi, Oppo, and OnePlus have invested in India, but mostly through their contract manufacturers. As a result, production increased from $13.4 billion in 2016-17 to $31.7 billion in 2019-20. However, analysis of factory-level production data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) shows that in 2017-18, value addition for surveyed firms (barring two outliers) ranged from 1.6% to 17.4%, with most of the firms being below 10%. For the majority of the surveyed firms, more than 85% of the inputs were imported. Comparable UN data for India, China, Vietnam, Korea and Singapore (2017-2019), show that except for India, all countries exported more mobile phone parts than imports — which indicates the presence of facilities that add value to these parts before exporting them. India, on the other hand, imported more than it exported, the least being in 2019 when its imports of mobile phone parts were 25 times the exports. Therefore, while the PMP policy increased the value of domestic production, improvement in local value addition remains a work-in-progress.

Further, in September 2019, Chinese Taipei contested the raise in tariffs under the PMP. If the PMP is found to be World Trade Organization (WTO) non-compliant, then we may be flooded with imports of mobile phones which might make the local assembly of mobile phones unattractive. This will affect the operations of the mobile investments done under the PMP.

Focus on value of production

The new PLI policy offers an incentive subject to thresholds of incremental investment and sales of manufactured goods; these thresholds vary for foreign and domestic mobile firms. Thus, focus remains on increasing value of domestic production, and not local value addition. According to our calculations, if implemented in toto, an additional capacity of 60 crore mobile phones per year may be onstream at the end of the PLI, i.e. FY25.

Shift from China is unlikely

Chinese firms that dominate the Indian market are not a part of the PLI policy. Thus their capacity expansion, if any, will be in addition to this. India produced around 29 crore units of mobile phones for the year 2018-19; 94% of these were sold in the domestic market, with the remaining being exported. This implies that much of the incremental production and sales under the PLI policy will have to be for the export market.

Also read | Govt. clears ₹11,000-cr. of PLI proposals by Samsung, others

Recently, a study by Ernst & Young for the India Cellular & Electronics Association showed that if the cost of production of a mobile phone is say 100 (without subsidies), then the effective cost (with subsidies and other benefits) of manufacturing mobile phone in China is 79.55, Vietnam, 89.05, and India (including PLI), 92.51. This shows that incentives under the PLI policy may not turn out to be a game-changing move, and it may be premature to expect a major chunk of mobile manufacturing to shift from China to India.

It may also be useful to recall that mobile phone investments that occurred around 2005, targeted relatively local and low value export markets, which is being followed by the incumbent mobile manufacturers in the county. Numbers show that though India’s mobile phone exports grew from $1.6 billion in 2018-19 to $3.8 billion in 2019-20, the per unit value declined from $91.1 to $87, respectively. Thus, our export competitiveness seems to be in mobiles with lower selling price. However, for foreign firms chosen under the PLI policy, the incentive will be computed on the basis of the invoice value of phones available at and above ₹15,000 ($204.65). This is surprising as it is clear that the PLI policy does not strengthen our current export competitiveness in mobile phones; and markets with higher average selling price have lower volumes.

Difficult for domestic firms

The five foreign firms that have been chosen are Samsung and four of Apple’s contract manufacturers. Samsung and two of Apple’s contract manufacturers already have facilities in India, and can be expected to continue with their strategy of dependence on imported inputs. Domestic firms have been nearly wiped out from the Indian market. So, their ability to take advantage of the PLI policy and grab a sizeable domestic market share seems difficult. Domestic firms may have the route of exporting cheaper mobile phones to other low-income countries. However, their performance in the last couple of years has not been promising. For example, among the chosen domestic firms, Lava International reported exports of ₹324 crore in FY18, while Optiemus Electronics exported ₹83 crore in FY18 and ₹4 lakh in FY19. Thus, how well they respond to the opportunity that the PLI policy provides is an open question.

Supply chain colocation

Finally, the six component firms that have been given approval under the ‘specified electronic components segment’, though a welcome step, do not complete the mobile manufacturing ecosystem. For example, literature shows that when Samsung set up shop in Vietnam, it relied heavily on its Korean suppliers which co-located with it to produce intermediate inputs, so much so that 63 among Samsung’s 67 suppliers then were foreign. It was a surprise when it was found through our primary survey that though Samsung is invested hugely in India, it has not colocated its supply chain in the country.

In summary, the PMP policy, since 2016-17 has barely been helpful in raising domestic value addition in the industry even though value of production expanded considerably. As backward integration via tariff protection is likely to come up against WTO rules, the new PLI focus is on increasing domestic production, and not value addition. The policy has separately licensed six component manufacturers to start domestic manufacturing. This may not succeed as the assemblers and component manufacturers move together. A first step in this direction could be to encourage foreign firms chosen under the PLI policy to colocate their supply ecosystems in the country.

380,2020/10/15,"Letters to the Editor — October 15, 2020","Row in Maharashtra

State Governors have known to be partisan. However, the Governor in Maharashtra, as well as some others, is functioning like a de facto State party chief. The President of India should take suo motu notice of the Governor’s letter and remind him that his post is constitutional and that he is bound to maintain dignity. If the Governors appointed by the BJP government are uncomfortable with their ornamental constitutional post, they can always resign and join the mainstream of the party which they represented instead of indulging in politics (Page 1, “Pawar backs Uddhav, writes to PM”, October 14).

N. Nagarajan,

Secunderabad

The current ‘set’ of Governors has surpassed even the partisan behaviour of Governors appointed under the Congress regime. The BJP does not seem to have got over the pain of losing power in Maharashtra and is trying every trick in the book to embarrass or bring down the present government in Maharashtra. Maharashtra Governor B.S. Koshyari’s letter to the Chief Minister of Maharashtra is not befitting the high office he holds. Even if there is a valid reason for not reopening temples, the tone and tenor of the Governor’s letter is condemnable.

Thread of hope

After an insipid showing in the initial stages of the IPL 2020, the much fancied Chennai Super Kings have made amends, leaving the team hanging by a slender thread in the race for the play-offs. Interestingly, the Dhoni-led CSK has faced such a situation earlier. The sudden exit of two of its stalwarts, Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh, has taken its toll on the team. Despite the win in Dubai, it is still going to be a bumpy road ahead for CSK and its legion of fans who have to keep their fingers crossed hoping for a change in fortunes in the remaining games.

382,2020/10/15,"Attempts to ‘finish off’ Bollywood will not be tolerated, says Uddhav","State Culture Department prepares SOP regarding reopening of cinema halls closed for over six months due to coronavirus pandemic.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said attempts to malign and “finish off” the Hindi film industry or “to shift it” will not be tolerated.

Mr. Thackeray’s statement came against the backdrop of probes by multiple agencies into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and its media coverage which was seen by some as a deliberate campaign to target Bollywood.

“Moves to finish off the film industry or shift it elsewhere will never be tolerated,” a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office quoted Mr. Thackeray as saying at a meeting with multiplex and theater owners.

Mumbai was not only the country’s financial capital but also its entertainment capital, he said.

“Bollywood enjoys a following across the globe. The film industry generates huge employment. In the last few days, attempts have been made to malign the image of the film industry by certain quarters which is painful,” he said.

The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh recently announced a plan to create a film city in that State to woo film-makers.

Mr. Thackeray informed cinema and multiplex owners at the meeting that the State Culture Department has prepared a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) regarding reopening of cinema halls which have been closed for over six months due to coronavirus pandemic.

The decision about reopening cinema halls will be taken at the earliest after the SOP is finalised, he said.

“The government is positive about it. Entertainment industry is a means to boost the State’s economy and the government is keen to restart it,” the Chief Minister said.

“In a cinema hall, people are in one room for nearly two hours and hence we want to ensure complete cleanliness and sanitisation as well as physical distancing. There is a need to ensure that only 50% seats are occupied,” he said.

Culture minister Amit Deshmukh said priority will be given to the safety of film-goers, though reopening of cinema halls will boost the economy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/adpezh/article32842074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN13UDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/attempts-to-finish-off-bollywood-will-not-be-tolerated-says-uddhav/article32862521.ece
383,2020/10/15,Awhad asks Maharashtra Governor if he will write to Goa CM for reopening of temples,"Goa, ruled by BJP, also has B S Koshyari as Governor.

Amid the row over Maharashtra Governor B S Koshyari’s letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking reopening of places of worship, State Minister Jitendra Awhad has asked if the Governor would write a similar letter to Goa CM Pramod Sawant.

Mr. Koshyari is also the governor of Goa.

The Governor and Mr. Thackeray were on Tuesday locked in a bitter war of words after the former pushed for reopening of places of worship in Maharashtra closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and asked the Shiv Sena president whether he has suddenly turned secular.

NCP leader Awhad in a tweet on Wednesday said Mr. Koshyari is the Governor of Goa, where there is a BJP government.

“There (in Goa) also temples are shut. Will the Governor show his love for temples and write a letter to Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant?” he asked in the tweet.

After receiving the Governor’s letter seeking to reopen places of worship, Mr/ Thackeray had responded to him saying he will consider the request but asserted he does not need the Governor’s certificate for “my Hindutva“.

NCP president Sharad Pawar later wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing shock over the “intemperate language” used in the Governor’s missive to Mr. Thackeray.

The CPI (M) on Wednesday demanded sacking of Mr. Koshyari for “mocking” secularism in his letter to Mr. Thackeray.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3d1ttj/article31691051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMJITENDRAAWHAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/awhad-asks-maharashtra-governor-if-he-will-write-to-goa-cm-for-reopening-of-temples/article32860877.ece

Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi on Wednesday said there was no question of her concealing facts regarding medical seats admission or Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) as she was only citing the judiciary in one issue and the settled policy of the Union Government in the other.

Responding to Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy’s remarks at a press conference the other day accusing her of not disclosing the full facts on these issues, Ms. Bedi said she had stuck to the truth in pointing to the clarity of the note from the Ministry of Home Affairs issued on October 6 that the Government of India policy was to provide benefits by DBT mode only.

“It was received from the MHA on clarification sought. Hence there is no question of anything personal in this. This is the truth. As regards the medical seats orders, it is the Judiciary’s decision. This too is the truth,” Ms. Bedi said.

The Lt. Governor went on to list the advantages of the DBT such as it did away with transmission loss, bills, contracts, tenders and complaints about distribution. The system also eliminated complaints of quality, pilferage and delay in delivery and provided the consumer, the choice of time and quality. So, when a system works for the people, why should it disturb people’s representatives? Ms. Bedi sought to know.

“The deciding authority for the Union Territory is MHA. The office of the Lt. Governor works as an Administrator and a link between the Centre and the Government of Puducherry to ensure that the interests of the people are safeguarded in the most honest and transparent manner,” Ms. Bedi said.

The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has joined hands with Travancore Titanium Products Ltd. (TTP) to protect houses threatened by coastal erosion using special blocks made from red gypsum and cement packed in geobags.

Mayor K. Sreekumar inaugurated a pilot project using B-CAP (Block for Coastal Area Protection) at Vettucaud on Thursday in the presence of TTP chairman A.A. Rasheed and managing director Georgee Ninan.

B-CAPs have a long life and have been found ideal for the construction of railway platforms, roads, and houses, according to the TTP. For coastal protection, the blocks are filled in geobags manufactured by Coirfed and deposited around residences as a bulwark against the waves.

A by-product

Red gypsum is a by-product of titanium dioxide production. The ingredients of B-CAP are red gypsum (32%), sand (58%) and cement (10%), TTP officials said.

If the project is found successful, it would be extended to other stretches of the coast in the Corporation area, Mr. Sreekumar said. The blocks offer better protection to the houses than sandbags often used by the residents, he said.

The Union Ministry of Power (MoP) conceded the Andhra Pradesh government's request to surrender 125 Megawatts of thermal power that was allocated to the DISCOMs by NTPC for bundling with solar energy under the National Solar Mission (NSM). With this, the DISCOMs will be saving ₹150 crore per annum on fixed costs, according to an official release.

The power was allocated to the DISCOMs on July 5, 2017 from coal - based stations of NTPC for bundling with solar power under NSM. On receiving a communication from the MoP, the Central Electricity Authority gave it's consent.

The Energy Department of A.P. welcomed the MoP's decision and said it will help minimise the power procurement costs and reduce unwanted financial burden on the DISCOMs.

Energy Secretary N. Srikant thanked the Secretary of MoP, Sanjiv Nandan Sahai for approving the State government's proposal.

He stated that the government was exploring ways to reduce the power purchase costs and accorded high priority to cost - effective power.

The measures being taken for the last one year for reviving and strengthening the power utilities, mainly by procuring power at cheaper rates, were yielding the desired results.

With spot purchasing of power at an average price of ₹1.63 - 2.80 per unit during March and April of the current year, the power utilities reduced financial burden on DISCOMs to a large extent.

The rich verse poetry and popular lyrics of Jaladi Raja Rao, popularly known as Jaladi would be remembered for a long time, said Minister for Home and Disaster Management, Mekathoti Sucharitha.

Addressing a meeting organised by Ambedkar India Mission at Jaladi’s 10th death anniversary held here on Thursday, the Home Minister said that Jaladi’s verse mesmerised generations of filmgoers. It was unfortunate that Jaladi, who hailed from a marginalised community, never got proper recognition from the film fraternity, she said.

Additional DG, CID, P.V. Sunil Kumar lavished praise on the poet.

“Jaladi’s writing reflected his simple upbringing and the influence of a rustic rural life. His use of everyday subjects and popular dialect made him extremely popular. Yet, he was left out when it came to major awards like the Padma Shri. While writers and actors of lesser talent have won awards and recognition, Jaladi had never been recognised,” Mr. Sunil Kumar said.

Jaladi Vijayamma, writer and daughter of Jaladi, in an emotional speech, said her father had faced discrimination throughout his life but had never showed hatred towards anyone.

Stating that she had been with him throughout his life, first in Chennai and later in Visakhapatnam, Ms. Vijayamma said that Jaladi’s love for his country was perfectly captured in his famous song ‘Punyabhoomi Naa Desam Namo Namami’, which was sung by S.P. Balasubrahmaniam for the blockbuster movie Major Chandrakanth. She lamented that her father never got his due.

407,2020/10/15,District records steep fall in cases,"Human behaviour will play a vital part in stabilising the curve, say experts

Have we already seen the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic phase and is the curve stabilising, are the questions that are crossing everybody’s mind in the city.

Well going by the statistics, it appears that there is a trend towards flattening, but health officials are keeping their fingers crossed. They say that this is the most crucial phase and human behaviour is going to play a vital part in stabilising the curve.

The period of July and August was the bad phase, as the district recorded over 37,000 cases, of them 80% were under GVMC city limits, and there were over 250 deaths. On June 30, the total number of cases were 976 and deaths were 5. But by end of August the number of cases shot up to 37,106 and death toll had gone up to 258. September was the month, when the curve started to flatten, as it recorded about 13,000 cases and deaths were about 150.

“From averaging around 1,000 cases per day in August, we dropped down to 150 to 200 cases, from the first week of September. This is a significant drop of over 75%, according to a conservative estimate,” said District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar.

“In October till date, the district recorded close to 2,800 cases and if the trend continues, then we should end up close to 5,000 cases, till the month- end,” he said.

But he was fast to add that it was too early to say that the curve is flattening.

“We have seen resurgence not only in Kerala and Delhi, but in other European countries also,” he said. According to him, human behaviour is going to play a key role in the next couple of months, if the curve is to stabilise. “In England and in France and in some other European countries, there is a resurgence, as people started to flout the basic protocols, once the economy was opened up. But at the same time, New York city, which was recording close to 1,000 deaths during the peak period, almost dropped to zero, as the people started to follow the protocols earnestly,” said Dr. Sudhakar.

“We have to learn both from the negative experience of Europe and the positive side of New York city,” he said.

“It is now the responsibility of people to follow the basic key protocols, such as wearing a mask, keeping social distance and maintaining personal hygiene, especially frequent washing of hands with soap or alcohol-based sanitisers,” he said.

Delay in test reports

On the prolonged delay for test reports, Dr. Sudhakar said that RTPCR testing has been stopped for a couple of days to clear the backlog.

Following ICMR guidelines to conduct RTPCR tests on all who tested negative in rapid antigen test, the load on the virology lab has increased phenomenally.

“When the capacity of the lab is to test 2,000 to 3,000 samples, it was stretched to 5000 by adopting various means, and now the figure has gone up to 7,000 per day. That is why, we are first clearing the backlog first and hence the delay for those who tested recently,” said an official from the virology lab at KGH.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/kyyn7/article32857158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15-VZ-COVIDTEST2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/district-records-steep-fall-in-cases/article32857159.ece
408,2020/10/15,"Global Handwashing Day | Wash your hands, keep diseases at bay","October 15 is Global Handwashing Day; over the past six months we have learnt the importance of washing hands owing to COVID-19

Ever since the COVID-19 outbreak, governments, influencers and celebrities have been talking about the importance of handwashing in one voice. As over the last six months, videos, songs, memes and posters have been filling up our social media feeds; we as a country have re-learnt the importance of washing hands.

When Global Handwashing Partnership founded Global Handwashing Day, to be observed annually on October 15, in 2008, little did the world know that 2020 would turn out to be the year for hand hygiene.

This year, owing to COVID-19, Global Handwashing Day assumes greater relevance. The theme, ‘Hand Hygiene for All’, explains that a seemingly simple act as washing hands with soap is an easy, effective, and affordable way to prevent diseases and save lives.

In the early days of the outbreak in India, the Telangana Police took ‘hand-washing’ lessons to the road in Hyderabad, showing motorists the right way to wash hands after Kerala Police turned to social media to spread the word. The viral video had six policemen, masked and dancing, to the ‘Kalakatha...’ song by Nanjyamma from the Malayalam film Ayyappanum Koshyum.

As people reached out for hand sanitisers, they are now being told that washing hands was a more effective means of prevention. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (India), keeping hands clean can prevent one in three diarrhoeal illnesses and one in five respiratory infections, such as cold or the flu. “Hand washing is an infection control practice. This year we have been training hospital staff and bystanders in the correct method of washing hands. It helps significantly to reduce infection therefore nullifies the requirement to take antibiotics,” says Dr Anitha A, Superintendent General Hospital, Ernakulam.

State governments, volunteer groups and private business went about installing moveable sinks and soap in public spaces such as markets, bus stands, and railway stations, on roadsides too. For instance, in Kerala, this was done as part of the ‘Break the Chain’ campaign which included wearing masks. Even today there are a few sinks and soaps that have been placed in public spaces.

In fact, to mark the day, schools under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation have been asked to raise awareness among students on the importance washing hands. Schools have been asked to demonstrate the right way of washing hands and urge students to spread the message in their communities as well.

Chairman of Rotary District, 3201, Madhusudhan R talks about WINS, a ‘Wash in Schools’ project they have been conducting for the last five years. The regions of Coimbatore Urban, Palakkad, Thrissur, Ernakulam and Idukki come under the purview of the district which has 145 clubs and 5000 members. Each club has adopted one school.

Hand-washing stations comprising four taps and accompanying soap were set up in the adopted schools of the Rotary districts. “Children being the best teachers for their parents we started the campaign in schools. To bring about awareness of the importance of washing hands the right method of hand-washing was taught to students. Teachers were trained in it; this helps reduce infection at source,” says Madhusudhan.

‘Handwashing’ tutorials and playlists for the prescribed 20-second duration for a clean hand-wash are still a rage. Handwash playlists abound with songs such as Lou Bega’s ‘Mambo No: 5’, ‘Happy Birthday to you’ sung twice, ‘Let it Go’ from the Disney film Frozen, Michael Jackson’s ‘Thriller’ to Britney Spears’ ‘Oops I did it Again’...the point is, whichever be your song just wash your hands.

409,2020/10/15,Bhubaneswar’s Nandankanan zoo revives ‘adopt-an-animal’ scheme,"When one adopts an animal or a bird, the contribution goes to its care, feeding, enclosure enrichment and renovation.

The Nandankanan Zoological Park (NZP) in Bhubaneswar, which suffered a huge loss following its closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has revived its innovative ‘Adopt-An-Animal’ programme to mobilise resources for animals.

The NZP is one of the leading zoos in the country in terms of its fauna population and species diversity. It had received a record 32 lakh footfall three years ago.

With resources drying up due to the closure for more than six months, the NZP authorities revived the ‘Adopt-An-Animal’ programme.

“We have received encouraging response from animal lovers. More than 100 organisations and individuals have come forward to adopt animals, pledging ₹22 lakh ,” NZP Deputy Director Bimala Prasanna Acharya said.

When one adopts an animal or a bird, the contribution goes to its care, feeding, enclosure enrichment and renovation.

The adoption scheme would bring public, corporate bodies and institutions closer to the zoo and heighten their love and passion for captive animals and birds, the authorities said.

“The NZP earns in the range of ₹15 crore-₹17 crore from entry passes and outsourcing of boating and parking facilities every year. With a minimum of ₹50 lakh required per month for the upkeep of animals, the zoo faced huge hardships due to the loss of revenue following the closure,” Mr. Acharya said.

Though the Odisha government had stepped in to provide funds for feed and medicines, critical gap persisted in other bare minimum necessities, he said.

Adoption certificate

The zoo authorities came up with the scheme urging animal lovers to provide funds from ₹500 to ₹2.5 lakh. In lieu, a ‘Thank You’ in the form of an adoption certificate, a plaque in the zoo and income tax rebates are available to individuals and organisations.

They are hopeful that ₹1 crore can be generated through adoption. The highest of ₹2.5 lakh per annum has been fixed to adopt an elephant, while ₹1.5 lakh is required for a melanistic tiger.

Similarly, people can adopt the Asiatic lion and the Royal Bengal Tiger for ₹1 lakh per annum.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/sf9mbh/article32865523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THRDROYAL1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/bhubaneswars-nandankanan-zoo-revives-adopt-an-animal-scheme/article32865524.ece
410,2020/10/15,"Coronavirus | Herd immunity approach to control COVID-19 ‘a dangerous fallacy’, say scientists","Based on evidence from many countries, the scientists said it is not possible to restrict uncontrolled outbreaks to certain sections of society.

Managing COVID-19 by allowing herd immunity to develop in low-risk populations while protecting the most vulnerable is “a dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,” warn an international group of 80 researchers in an open letter.

The letter, published in The Lancet journal, referred to by its authors as the John Snow Memorandum, noted that any pandemic management strategy relying upon the population to develop immunity from natural infections for COVID-19 is flawed.

In the face of a second wave of infection in several parts of the world, the scientists including Devi Sridhar from the University of Edinburgh in the U.K., said there is currently renewed interest in herd immunity approaches allowing a large uncontrolled outbreak in low-risk populations while protecting the vulnerable.

While some have argued this approach could lead to the development of infection-acquired immunity in the low-risk population, which will eventually protect the vulnerable, the researchers explained such uncontrolled transmission in younger people risks significant ill-health and death.

Based on evidence from many countries, the scientists said it is not possible to restrict uncontrolled outbreaks to certain sections of society, adding that it is “practically impossible” and “highly unethical” to isolate large swathes of the population.

While special efforts to protect the most vulnerable are essential, they said these must go hand-in-hand with multi-pronged population-level strategies.

“Effective measures that suppress and control transmission need to be implemented widely, and they must be supported by financial and social programmes that encourage community responses and address the inequities that have been amplified by the pandemic,” they wrote in the letter.

“Continuing restrictions will probably be required in the short term, to reduce transmission and fix ineffective pandemic response systems, in order to prevent future lockdowns,” the researchers said.

According to the scientists, the restrictions can effectively suppress the number if infections to low levels that allow rapid detection of localised outbreaks.

They said such measures can also compliment rapid response through efficient and comprehensive testing, contact tracing, isolation and support systems.

“Protecting our economies is inextricably tied to controlling COVID-19. We must protect our workforce and avoid long-term uncertainty,” they said.

The researchers cautioned that there is currently no evidence for lasting protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection.

They said this waning immunity as a result of natural infection would not end the COVID-19 pandemic but instead result in repeated waves of transmission over several years.

According to the scientists, vulnerable populations are at risk for the indefinite future, as natural infection-based herd immunity strategies would result in recurrent epidemics, as seen with many infectious diseases before mass vaccination.

So they called for controlling the spread of the virus until the population can be vaccinated.

Natural infection-based herd immunity approaches risk impacting the workforce as a whole and overwhelming the ability of healthcare systems to provide acute and routine care, the researchers warned.

They said clinicians still do not understand who might suffer from ‘long COVID’ in which the symptoms linger for weeks.

“The evidence is very clear: controlling community spread of COVID-19 is the best way to protect our societies and economies until safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics arrive within the coming months,” the scientists wrote.

“We cannot afford distractions that undermine an effective response; it is essential that we act urgently based on the evidence,” they concluded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/b35iet/article31602073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TH-SCIHERD-IMMUNITY,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-herd-immunity-approach-to-control-covid-19-a-dangerous-fallacy-say-scientists/article32862069.ece
411,2020/10/15,A sister born to save ailing brother,"Under ‘saviour sibling’ experiment, baby’s bone marrow was used to save child

India’s first ‘saviour sibling’ experiment is a success, say doctors.

A one-year-old sibling has saved her brother’s life by donating her bone marrow. Kavya was conceived by her parents through invitro fertilisation to save her brother, Abhijeet Solanki, who was born with Thalassemia.

Thalassemia is a disorder where the haemoglobin count is low in blood and such persons require frequent blood transfusions.

Abhijeet was born in November 2013 but unlike normal babies he did not achieve the growth milestones. The parents learned that Abhijeet had Thalassemia major. Abhijeet required blood transfusions every 25 days and the gap between two transfusions reduced as he grew. By the age of six Abhijeet had undergone 80 transfusions, recalled his father Sahdev Singh Solanki. The only way to save him was through a bone marrow transplant.

The family was willing to donate their bone marrow but the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) of the family, including that of his older sister, did not match.

The Solanki family consulted many doctors. Mr. Solanki’s research led him to the ‘saviour sibling’ concept following which he sought out Manish Banker, medical director of Nova IVF Fertility in Ahmedabad.

Dr. Banker said Mr. Solanki’s research and the science behind it was known but nobody had approached him with such a request before.

Dr. Banker started the assisted reproductive therapy, called pre-implantation genetic testing, for monogenic disorder with HLA matching. The couple underwent three cycles of IVF and 18 embryos were created. Of this only one perfectly matched Abhijeet’s HLA. The embryo was implanted in Apla Solanki, who delivered a baby girl a year ago.

“We had to wait for the baby to grow. She had to weigh 10 kg before we could draw bone marrow,” said Deepa Trivedi, programme director of Sankalp Bone Marrow Unit, CIMS Hospital, Ahmedabad.

Pointing out that the best therapeutic option for Thalassemia major patients is bone marrow transplant from an HLA-identical donor, Dr. Banker said, “We are extremely thrilled to be part of reproductive history in India to create the first-ever ‘saviour-sibling’ through ART. We used pre-genetic diagnosis and screening test, an established method for conceiving a child who may donate cord blood or hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation to save a critically ill sibling.”

Mr. Solanki said the transplant was done on March 17. Since then Abhijeet has not needed any blood transfusion, indicating that he had been cured of the disorder. His haemoglobin count was 11.3, Dr. Trivedi said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/rpcp89/article32857127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Thalassemia,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/a-sister-born-to-save-ailing-brother/article32856312.ece
