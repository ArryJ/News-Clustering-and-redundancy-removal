Heavy favourite Los Angeles Lakers dismantled the Miami Heat 116-98 in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday, as its opponent struggled with injuries after making a fast start.

Heat got a 13-point leg up in the first quarter but the lead was short-lived, as Lakers drained 11 three-pointers to complete a 30-point turnaround and close out the first half, while Miami’s defence crumbled inside the NBA’s quarantined campus.

Lakers kept the pressure up as two of the Heat’s biggest playmakers — point guard Goran Dragic and forward Bam Adebayo — exited with a foot injury and shoulder strain respectively.

50th Finals game

Sixteen-time All-Star LeBron James, competing in his 50th NBA Finals game, scored 25 points with 13 rebounds and nine assists.

2,2020/10/01,Ostapenko cuts short Pliskova’s stay,"Kenin struggles; Djokovic puts on a masterclass but Shapovalov bundled out

Former champion Jelena Ostapenko ousted second seed Karolina Pliskova from the French Open with a 6-4, 6-2 win in the second round on Thursday after an error-ridden performance from the Czech.

The Latvian, who won the 2017 title, played aggressively and hit 27 winners as Pliskova struggled to rein in her unforced errors.

The 23-year-old Ostapenko broke her opponent’s serve three times in the first set and twice in the second to seal her victory and ensure Pliskova remained the only active former World No.1 who has not won a Grand Slam.

American fourth seed Sofia Kenin ran into a spot of bother before reaching the third round with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory against Romanian Anna Bogdan.

Top seed Simona Halep had put in a disciplined performance to tame Irina-Camelia Begu 6-3, 6-4 on Wednesday, to extend her winning run to 16 matches.

In the men’s section, Novak Djokovic barely broke sweat in reaching the third round with a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 thrashing of outclassed Lithuanian Ricardas Berankis.

Spanish tennis player Gerard Joseph Platero Rodriguez has been suspended for four years and fined $15,000 after being convicted of courtsiding, the first player to be charged with the offense.

The Tennis Integrity Unit said Wednesday that six months of the ban were suspended on condition that no further breaches of the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program were committed.

It said an investigation established that Rodriguez, who has no ranking, had acted as a courtsider at an ITF tournament held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in July 2019. Court-siding is a prohibited practice which involves transmission of live scoring data from a match to a third party for betting purposes.

Rodriquez was also found to have placed 75 online bets on tennis matches during June 2019.

4,2020/10/01,IIT-M team develops sutures with nanofiber yarns,"These are bio-absorbable and can deliver a higher load of antibiotics or therapeutics at the site itself

A team of researchers at IIT Madras is ready with a prototype of suture thread made of nanofiber yarns that is bio-absorbable and can deliver a higher load of antibiotics and/or therapeutics at the site itself.

The suture material uses nanofibers woven as yarn using certain specific techniques, and the strength can be varied depending on the target tissue (skin, muscle, cartilage), explains Rama S. Verma of the Stem Cell and Molecular Biology laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, IIT Madras. Each strand has a good tensile strength, besides degrading rapidly and mimics the collagen fibrils of body tissues, he adds.

Several innovations globally in suture material have advanced infection control and achieved in some cases, better recovery among patients, even as other options such as staples, glues and strips have become available.

Nanofiber yarns are thread-like structures formed by twisting together hundreds of nanofibers, Prof. Verma explains. The way the nanofibers mimicked the collagen fibril sparked the idea in a lab that primarily works on scaffold-based tissue engineering to create thread like structures by twisting nanofibers together using custom-made machinery. Arti Sunil Richard, Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology, IIT Madras, also worked on the project that won the ‘SITARE-Gandhian Young Technological Innovation (GYTI) Award 2020’ recently.

“Several experiments were done to prove its compatibility, mechanical strength, stem cell interaction, immune responses, and antibacterial property, and they were compatible with prescribed norms in surgical procedure,” Prof. Verma claims. The team also loaded the fibers to deliver drugs at site, he says, adding that it might be more suitable for internal sutures and on soft tissues. The bio absorbability aspect makes sure that the sutures do not have to be removed.

Initial funding has been received for the project, and the team is looking for further funding to deliver surgery-ready nanofiber yarn at reasonable costs, he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/l2vv4e/article32746958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/The-Nanofiber-yarn-based-suture-developed-by-IIT-Madras-Researchers,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/iit-m-team-develops-sutures-with-nanofiber-yarns/article32746959.ece

6,2020/10/01,A biometric system uses finger vein to establish identity,"An upgrade to the basic fingerprint biometric system, it allows accurate identification with multiple fingers as well.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

A new biometric system developed by researchers at the University of Buffalo uses 3D images of finger vein to establish identity.

Since no two people have the exact same 3D vein pattern, faking a vein biometric authentication would require creating an exact 3D replica, which is impossible, according to the study titled ‘3D Finger Vein Biometric Authentication with Photoacoustic Tomography’.

The team used an imaging technique called photo-acoustic tomography for the 3D finger vein biometric authentication. The technique uses light to identify the vein. The system then detects that with an ultrasound detector, and uses it to reconstruct a 3D image of the veins.

The tests could accurately accept or reject identities 99% of the time, the study showed.

The method could be used to enable better authentication techniques to protect personnel data and sensitive documents as it detects invisible features in 3D. It could also ensure specificity and anti-spoofing features.

Amazon has introduced a new biometric system that will allow people to use their palm to make payments. All they need is an Amazon One device, a credit card and a phone number.

The Seattle-based company says the service is highly secure, and uses algorithms and hardware to create a person’s unique palm signature.

People will just have to insert the card into the device, hover their palm over it, and follow prompts from the device so it creates a unique palm signature using the e-commerce company’s computer vision technology.

Once their palm print is registered, they can use Amazon One at select Amazon Go stores, just by holding their palm above the Amazon One device for a second, at entry.

Palm recognition is considered more private than some biometric alternatives, it also requires someone to make an intentional gesture by holding their palm over the device to use, Amazon explained in a blog post.

Food delivery apps Zomato and Swiggy have received notices from Google for their in-app gamification features that allegedly violate the tech giant’s Play Store guidelines.

The development comes just weeks after Paytm was blocked from the Play Store for a few hours for violating Google’s policy on sports betting activities.

When contacted, Zomato confirmed receiving the notice and termed it as “unfair”.

“Yes, we have received a notice from Google. We believe that the notice is unfair, but we are a small company and have already realigned our business strategy to comply with Google’s guidelines,” a Zomato spokesperson said in an e-mailed response.

The spokesperson added that the company will be replacing Zomato Premier League with another program by the weekend.

While Swiggy did not comment on the development, sources said the company has paused the in-app feature and is in conversation with Google on this issue.

Google did not comment on the matter.

Various companies are trying to cash in on the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) and have added gamification features to woo customers, enhance engagement and boost sales.

On September 18, Paytm app was blocked from Play Store for a few hours for violating Google’s policy on sports betting activities.

The app was restored after the SoftBank-backed Paytm removed the ‘cashback’ feature linked to a game on the app.

Paytm had alleged that it was “arm-twisted” by the search engine major to comply with its biased Play Store policies “that are meant to artificially create Google’s market dominance”.

Interestingly, Google had on Tuesday had clarified that apps that choose to sell digital content through its Play Store will have to use the Google Play billing system and pay a percentage of the in-app purchase as a fee.

Many Indian startups have raised concerns around this move, saying Google cannot force Indian app developers / owners to sell digital services by compulsorily using its billing system, and giving the US-based company a 30 per cent fee on each transaction.

President Donald Trump is planning to cut refugee admissions by 3,000 to 15,000 in 2021, submitting his proposal to Congress less than an hour before the deadline for the fiscal year’s figure was to expire, the administration announced late Wednesday.

The 40-year-old resettlement programme has been dwindling under his administration and the 2021 figure will continue to shrink it. The 2021 figure is a 16% reduction over 2020’s admissions.

The 1980 Refugee Act requires presidents to issue their determination by October 1 for the next fiscal year. The President also must consult with Congress before making his determination, though ultimately it is up to him.

Trump froze refugee admissions in March amid the coronavirus pandemic, citing a need to protect American jobs as fallout from the coronavirus crashed the economy.

Azerbaijan’s Defence Ministry, in turn, said its forces had carried out “crushing artillery strikes against Armenian forces’ positions in the occupied territories” during the night.

It denied claims by Yerevan that one of its helicopters had been downed, crashing in Iran and said that fighters on the Armenian side had been “forced to retreat from previously held positions along the entire stretch of the frontline.”

16,2020/10/01,Trump claims debate victory; says exposed Biden’s ‘very dangerous agenda’,"US. President Donald Trump has claimed victory over his Democratic challenger Joe Biden in their first Presidential debate, saying he exposed “the very dangerous agenda” of the former Vice President and held him accountable for the “47 years of his lies” in public life.

During the first of the three presidential debates in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday night which was marked by angry interruptions and bitter accusations, the two candidates fiercely clashed over a number of issues, including racism, economy, climate, health care and the coronavirus.

Both the camps have declared victory in the debate.

Last night I did what the corrupt media has refused to do, I held Joe Biden accountable for his 47 years of lies, 47 years of betrayal and 47 years of failure. I held Joe accountable for shipping your jobs and dreams abroad and for bowing to the violent mob at home, Trump told his supporters, addressing an election rally in Duluth, Minnesota.

Mr. Biden, 77, is “too weak” to lead this country, he said, claiming that his Democratic rival badly lost the debate.

You know Biden lost badly when his supporters are saying he should cancel the rest of the debates. Now I understand he’s cancelling the debates. Let’s see what happens. I think that’s not gonna be a good move for him, Mr. Trump said.

After the chaotic first debate, the Commission on Presidential Debates said that it’s adding new tools to maintain order to the upcoming debates.

Mr. Trump’s frequent interruptions of the Democratic presidential nominee defined Tuesday night’s debate, with Biden frequently unable to complete a sentence.

Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News pleaded with Trump several times to allow Mr. Biden to speak uninterrupted, to no avail.

Addressing his first election rally after the presidential debate with Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump told his cheering supporters that he is also running against the “corrupt far-left” media, socialists, and communist in the Democrat Party.

That’s what has happened for too long. We have turned it around but don’t forget when they turned it around I had to fight other things like a fake impeachment. I had to fight a lot of things that are not like that wasn’t in the agenda. Never forget and we fought it very well, and frankly, we had great support from the Republican Party except for one person, but that’s all right, he said.

Referring to the conversations that he had during the debate, Mr. Trump said, “Mr. Biden was saying he owns that socialism and extremism in his party. It’s not his party. It’s not Joe’s party. You’ve got Crazy Bernie, you have AOC plus three, you’ve got all these crazy people. These maniacs. You have the green new deal. How about the green new deal? He disavowed it, he said.

Mr. Trump claimed that “Biden has pledged to terminate his travel ban on jihadist regions, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism.”

Remember I used to talk about it all the time. I got it banned. Remember, they said you’d never be able to get them banned. Then I lost at the lower court. I lost at the Court of Appeals. And they said he lost, he lost. And huge stories. Then I won at the Supreme Court. They didn’t even report it, he said.

My administration is keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals out of our country and we’re keeping them the hell out of Minnesota, he said.

Trump said that his performance in the last 437 months is better than that of Biden in his 47 years when he served as Senator from Delaware and Vice President of the country.

Now he’s pushing the most far-left platform in history. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for people with pre-existing conditions, give free federal health care to all illegal aliens bankrupting medicare, he said.

A vote for Republicans, Mr. Trump said, is a “vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all of Americans”.

Over the next four years we will make a America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all, said the President.

Earlier, interacting with reporters at the White House, Mr. Trump said he is looking forward to the other two debates in Florida and Tennessee. I don’t mind debating him. I hear he wants to get out of the debates. I don’t know. That’s up to him, he said.

Claiming that he won the first debate, he said I think he (Mr. Biden) was very weak. He was whining. We won the debate by almost every poll that I saw. If you look at the various polls. And I looked at about six of them, and we won every one of them.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7eqjs1/article32744434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-POLITICS-CONGRESS-BUDGET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-claims-debate-victory-says-exposed-bidens-very-dangerous-agenda/article32744436.ece
17,2020/10/01,EU launches legal action over U.K. Brexit bill,"The Commission has decided to send a letter of formal notice to the U.K. government which invites it to send its observations within a month, says EU chief Ursula von der Leyen

The European Union launched legal proceedings on Thursday in response to the British government's attempt to overturn parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.

The infringement procedure, which could come before European courts, has not derailed post-Brexit trade talks, but reflects mounting tension in Brussels as time runs short for a deal.

“This morning, the Commission has decided to send a letter of formal notice to the U.K. Government. This is the first step in an infringement procedure,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said.

“The letter invites the UK Government to send its observations within a month,” said von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission.

On Tuesday, British MPs backed a bill to regulate the UK's internal market from January 1, when Britain completes its post-Brexit transition period and leaves the EU single market and customs union.

The proposed text, by London's own admission, overwrites parts of the withdrawal treaty that Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed with EU leaders last year, a breach of international law.

Mr. Johnson's government has described this bill as a “safety net” in case post-Brexit trade talks fail and the EU tries to impose a customs border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

But EU capitals -- including Dublin -- see these provisions as key to preventing a return of a hard border with Ireland and preserving the good relations underpinned by the Good Friday peace deal in Northern Ireland.

“As you know, we had invited our British friends to remove the problematic parts of their draft internal market bill by the end of September,” Ms. von der Leyen said.

“This draft bill is, by its very nature a breach of the obligation of good faith laid down in the withdrawal agreement.

“Moreover, if adopted as is, it will be in full contradiction to the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.”

'An administrative step'

The EU said the bill would breach Article 5 of the Withdrawal Agreement, which states that both sides must “cooperate in good faith” to implement the deal.

If Britain does not back down, the infringement procedure could go all the way to the European Court of Justice, which would be able to impose large fines.

But the case is a fairly standard EU procedure. Many member states face dozens of legal challenges under EU law and, for example, this is the 94th active action against the U.K..

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters the development was merely “a necessary administrative step”.

“We will respond to the letter in due course,” a British government spokesman told reporters, playing down the significance of the announcement.

“We need to create a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK's internal market, ensure ministers can always deliver on their obligations to Northern Ireland and protect the gains from the peace process.”

Mr. Johnson has pushed on with the legislation -- despite concerns in his own party and a warning from Washington that it puts Irish peace at risk. The legislation is now being debated by the House of Lords.

In parallel to the battle over the bill, EU and U.K . negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost are meeting in Brussels this week for their final planned round of talks on a post-Brexit trade deal.

Diplomats say these talks will not be torpedoed by the legal action but London's stance has cast a cloud over negotiations ahead of a planned EU summit on October 15.

“The discussions are carrying on today and I think they have been conducted in a constructive spirit,” a Number 10 spokesman said.

-Economic shock

If there is no deal by the end of October, European officials warn it is hard to see how one could be ratified by the end of the year, meaning the UK would leave the single market with no trade agreement.

This would exacerbate what is already expected to be the economic shock of Brexit, with a more severe disruption to cross-Channel trade, renewed tariffs and the prospect of a dispute over fishing rights.

European leaders, meanwhile were arriving in Brussels for a two day summit on foreign policy and the EU budget.

Diplomats said they would not allow Brexit to divert them from their agenda, but that Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin would lay out Dublin's concerns on Friday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sf6q9k/article31936638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/URSULAVONDERLEYEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-launches-legal-action-over-uk-brexit-bill/article32743796.ece
18,2020/10/01,"U.S. Congressional report accuses China of violating other nations’ sovereignty, seeks decisive action","China has been fast expanding military and economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region, triggering concern in various countries of the region and beyond.

A U.S. Congressional report has sought decisive action against China, accusing Beijing of increasing military buildup, violating other nations’ sovereignty and engaging in fatal skirmishes to conduct a land-grab on the Indian border.

In its report unveiled on Wednesday, the China Task Force of the House Republicans also supported the proposal of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the creation of a new D-10 group of leading democracies, including India, for addressing both 5G mobile communications and vulnerable supply chains.

In just the past year alone, the China Communist Party (CCP) has violated an international treaty and dismantled Hong Kong’s civil liberties; continued its oppression of ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs and Tibetans; increased its military buildup, conducted increasingly belligerent provocations, and violated other nations’ sovereignty at sea; engaged in fatal skirmishes to conduct a land-grab on the Indian border; and asserted new territorial claims over Bhutan, the report said.

India and China are locked in a nearly five-month-long border standoff in eastern Ladakh. China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake in the last week of August.

China has been fast expanding military and economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region, triggering concern in various countries of the region and beyond.

China is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the resource-rich region.

China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the area.

Praising the State Department’s July 2020 statement which said that China’s territorial aggression in the South China Sea is illegal, the report said that the administration could take similar action regarding the CCP’s illegal conduct in other areas, including around the Senkaku Islands and along India’s border.

The U.S., it said, should improve predictability of arms sales with allies and partners, and expand military training with allied and partner nations. Doing so will improve interoperability with the U.S., support and protect American values, advance U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, and promote the U.S. as the partner of choice, it said.

It suggested more than 400 policy recommendations to address issues ranging from national security concerns, human rights violations, problems with the supply chain and China’s overall expanding influence on the world stage.

It pushed for coordinating a whole-of-government offensive information statecraft campaign to counter the propaganda machine of ruling Chinese Communist Party by using truth and American values to undermine CCP’s “lies and malign” ideology.

Further, the U.S. should expand forward presence and improve interoperability with allies and partner nations through the use of joint training and exercises, including by bringing together and regularising multilateral exercises with like-minded nations such as Australia, Japan, India, and other interested nations, the report said.

Supporting Mr. Johnson’s proposal for creating D-10 group of leading democracies (the current G-7 members, plus South Korea, India, and Australia), it said the U.S. should work with the U.K. and other nations in leveraging technical expertise of each nation in emerging technologies for the benefit of democratic countries.

“The U.S. should work with the U.K. and other nations to form a new D-10 group of leading democracies focused on developing and deploying 5G and subsequent generations, addressing 5G mobile communications and vulnerable supply chains, and leveraging technical expertise of each nation in emerging technologies for the benefit of democratic nations,” it said.

The China Task Force, comprised of 15 House Republicans representing 11 committees, including several Armed Services Members, was formed in May to assess the threat of China and come up with legislative solutions on how to combat the risks. In compiling its recommendations, the Task Force heard from 130 experts, including policy experts, business leaders, and Members of Congress.

“China presents a unique challenge to America’s interests and security. Confronting China will take a whole of government approach. We cannot rely on the military or on our diplomats alone; Congress also has an important role,” said Congress Mac Thornberry, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee.

House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, told reporters at a news conference that it is not only the most thorough report on China in the history of the House; it is bold, achievable, and bipartisan. It doesn’t just lay out the challenges; it lays out the solutions and legislative reform.

“One-third of these solutions have already either passed the House or the Senate. We need to make them become law,” he said.

Congressman Michael McCaul said that for decades the US and its allies have been asleep at the wheel until COVID-19 to countering the CCP’s 100-year marathon for global and military dominance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ar4gyb/article32743838.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAUSFLAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-congressional-report-accuses-china-of-violating-other-nations-sovereignty-seeks-decisive-action/article32743839.ece
19,2020/10/01,Unemployment marches higher in Europe amid coronavirus pandemic,"The jobless rate rose to 8.1% in the 19 countries that use the euro currency in August, up from 7.9% in July, official statistics showed

Unemployment rose for a fifth straight month in Europe in August amid concern that extensive government support programmes won’t be able keep many businesses hit by coronavirus restrictions afloat forever.

The jobless rate rose to 8.1% in the 19 countries that use the euro currency in August, up from 7.9% in July, official statistics showed Thursday. Some 13.2 million people were unemployed and the number of those out of work rose by 2,51,000.

Economists expect a further rise as wage support programs expire, while an increase in infections in many countries has increased fears that some restrictions on business interaction may have to be re-imposed.

Some 3.7 million people are still on furlough support programmes in Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy. The government has extended its emergency support through the end of 2021. National governments have poured in fiscal stimulus in the form of support loans and guarantees for business, while the European Central Bank has launched a 1.35 trillion euro ($1.57 trillion) monetary stimulus in the form of regular bond purchases with newly printed money through at least the middle of next year. That has helped keep financial markets calm and credit flowing to businesses.

But all those measures have not halted a wave of corporate announcements of job reductions. Companies in the hardest-hit industries such as airlines, tourism and restaurants may face a long period of substantially diminished demand for their services and are laying off workers.

The coronavirus in some cases has also accelerated restructuring programmes that existed before the pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8bcz3/article32707984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29AFPUK0001Q9051,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/unemployment-marches-higher-in-europe-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/article32742589.ece
20,2020/10/01,Hong Kong police arrest 60 for protesting on China holiday,"Those arrested included two district councilors, police said in a statement posted on Facebook.

Hong Kong police arrested at least 60 people on suspicion of unauthorised assembly on China’s National Day holiday on Thursday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district chanting pro-democracy slogans.

Those arrested included two district councilors, police said in a statement posted on Facebook. They said the people were arrested after they ignored repeated warnings asking them to disperse.

Online calls urged people to join protests, and crowds turned up at Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay shopping district, some people chanting ‘disband the police’ and ‘Liberate Hong Kong’, ‘Revolution of our time’,” a popular pro-democracy slogan that has been banned by the Hong Kong government for alleged secessionist sentiments.

A heavy police presence outnumbered the protesters at the scene.

National Day, which celebrates the founding of the People’s Republic of China, has become a day of protest in Hong Kong by those who oppose Beijing’s increasing control over the semi-autonomous city. Large-scale protests are forbidden because of social distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus.

In the afternoon, police cordoned off some areas in the district and searched people on the streets. On several occasions, they unfurled warning banners that urged protesters to disperse, saying they were participating in an illegal assembly.

Protests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect June 30.

The law outlaws subversive, secessionist, and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city’s internal affairs. The U.S. and Britain accuse China of infringing on the city’s freedoms, and the U.S. has imposed sanctions on government officials in Hong Kong and China over the law.

At a National Day reception, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded under the new law.

Lam also accused some foreign governments of holding double standards and leveling unjustified accusations against the authorities who implement the new law.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/n783jg/article32742394.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HONGKONG-CHINA-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hong-kong-police-arrest-60-for-protesting-on-china-holiday/article32742397.ece

The U.S. has committed $1.9 million to support vulnerable populations like informal sector workers whose livelihoods have been disrupted due to COVID-19.

“The financial assistance from US Agency for International Development (USAID), extended generously by the American people to partners in India, will support efforts to rebuild local economies and improve the livelihoods of Indians who have been hit hardest by this pandemic,” U.S. Ambassador to India Kenneth I. Juster said.

Highlighting the need to provide financial assistance to the people affected by the disruption caused by COVID-19, Mr. Juster said the global pandemic has severely affected those who are vulnerable and less fortunate, thereby increasing the economic challenges these groups face.

USAID funds will support the Revive alliance, founded by the Samhita-Collective Good Foundation and co-funded by the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, Omidyar Network India, and the Ford Foundation, to address challenges caused by unemployment and income gaps faced by workers in the informal economy, the US embassy said in a statement.

Revive will launch a $6.85 million blended finance facility in its first phase to provide accessible and affordable capital in the form of returnable grants or loans to self-employed workers and at-risk nano and micro enterprises to either sustain their work or find alternative business opportunities, it said.

The facility is expected to reach between 60,000-100,000 workers and enterprises and will give preference to youth and women. Revive will also undertake upskilling activities for laid-off youth and informal labourers, the statement said.

Samhita-Collective Good Foundation will initiate shared-value partnerships with a range of stakeholders, including business chambers, non-banking financial companies, private enterprises, and others. USAID support will further deepen Revive’s work by augmenting its secretariat strengthening strategic partnerships and offering technical assistance to partners, it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dkbr73/article24727268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THKENNETHJUSTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-us-commits-19-million-to-india-to-support-informal-sector-workers-micro-enterprises/article32742315.ece
22,2020/10/01,Turkish govt accused of hiding true extent of virus outbreak,"The revelation led to an outcry on social media, with people calling on the government to reveal the true spread of the coronavirus among the population of 83 million

Turkey’s government is being accused of hiding the true extent of the country’s coronavirus outbreak after the health minister revealed that the daily COVID-19 figures published by his ministry reflect only patients with symptoms and not all positive cases.

Minister Fahrettin Koca acknowledged during a news conference late Wednesday that since July 29, Turkey has been reporting the number of patients being cared for in hospitals or at their homes.

The count did not include asymptomatic positive cases, he said, ignoring a question about the number of new positive coronavirus cases per day, a key indicator of where the outbreak is headed in any country.

We are talking about people with symptoms. We are giving this as the daily number of patients, he told reporters.

The revelation led to an outcry on social media, with people calling on the government to reveal the true spread of the coronavirus among the population of 83 million. The hashtag asking what Is the number of cases? in Turkish was trending Thursday on Twitter.

The minister’s admission came after an opposition legislator, Murat Emir, claimed that the true number of daily new infections in Turkey was 19 times higher than the daily figures reported by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government.

Mr. Koca refuted the claim, insisting that all information published on a table showing Turkey’s daily coronavirus count is correct. On Thursday, Mr. Emir called on Mr. Koca to stop issuing the daily coronavirus data saying; Nobody believes it. It has no scientific value. No one takes it seriously. The government is battling against the figures instead of battling the outbreak, he said.

The Turkish Medical Association, which has for months accused the government of underreporting cases, called for transparency. The group had been questioning the daily coronavirus data after the government on July 29 changed the wording of the count from case to patient.

You failed to lead the process transparently. You hid the truth. You failed to prevent the spread, the group said.

Sebnem Korur Fincanci who heads the association tweeted: The truth is our right. The government on Wednesday reported 1,391 new coronavirus patients and 65 deaths. Since the pandemic began, Turkey says 318,000 residents have been infected and 8,195 have died.

Experts say reported numbers in all countries understate the true toll of the pandemic, due to limited testing, missed cases, data tampering by some governments and other factors.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/u0gv2j/article25059928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Turkeyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/turkish-govt-accused-of-hiding-true-extent-of-virus-outbreak/article32742125.ece
23,2020/10/01,"Senate approves bill to avoid shutdown, sending it to Trump","If Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House in November, it’s likely that another stopgap measure would fund the government into next year and that the next administration and Congress would deal with the leftover business.

By a sweeping bipartisan vote Wednesday, the Senate sent President Donald Trump a bill to fund the government through December 11, averting the possibility of a government shutdown when the new fiscal year starts Thursday.

Mr. Trump was expected to sign the measure before Wednesday’s midnight deadline, although he was still flying back to Washington late after a campaign rally in Minnesota. The temporary extension will set the stage for a lame-duck session of Congress later this year, where the agenda will be largely determined by the outcome of the presidential election.

The measure would keep the government running through December 11 and passed by a 84-10 vote. The House passed the bill last week.

The stopgap spending bill is required because the GOP-controlled Senate has not acted on any of the 12 annual spending bills that fund the 30% of the government’s budget that is passed by Congress each year.

If Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House in November, it’s likely that another stopgap measure would fund the government into next year and that the next administration and Congress would deal with the leftover business.

The measure is the bare minimum accomplishment for Capitol Hill’s powerful Appropriations committees, who pride themselves on their deal-making abilities despite gridlock in other corners of Congress.

The legislation — called a continuing resolution, or CR, in Washington-speak — would keep every federal agency running at current funding levels through December 11, which will keep the government afloat past an election that could reshuffle Washington’s balance of power.

The measure also extends many programs whose funding or authorizations lapse on September 30, including the federal flood insurance program, highway and transit programs, and a long set of extensions of various health programs, such as a provision to prevent Medicaid cuts to hospitals that serve many poor people.

It also finances the possible transition to a new administration if Mr. Biden wins the White House and would stave off an unwelcome COVID-caused increase in Medicare Part B premiums for outpatient doctor visits.

Farm interests won language that would permit Trump’s farm bailout to continue without fear of interruption.

In exchange, House Democrats won USD 8 billion in food aid for the poor.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2lx1bq/article32740614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SENATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/senate-approves-bill-to-avoid-shutdown-sending-it-to-trump/article32740615.ece
24,2020/10/01,Russia’s Navalny accuses Putin of being behind poisoning,"The Russian opposition leader who is President Putin’s fiercest critic, was flown to Germany two days after falling ill on Aug. 20 on a domestic flight in Russia.

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is recovering in Germany after being poisoned in Russia by a nerve agent, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being behind the attack in comments released Thursday.

Mr. Navalny’s supporters have frequently maintained that such an attack could have only been ordered at the top levels, though the Kremlin has steadfastly denied any involvement in it.

Mr. Navalny, a politician and corruption investigator who is Putin’s fiercest critic, was flown to Germany two days after falling ill on Aug. 20 on a domestic flight in Russia.

He spent 32 days in the hospital, 24 of them in intensive care, before doctors deemed his condition had improved sufficiently for him to be discharged.

He has posted frequent comments online as his recovery has progressed, but in his first interview since the attack, he told Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine that in his mind, Putin was behind the attack, in a German translation of his comments.

“I don’t have any other versions of how the crime was committed,” he said in a brief excerpt of the interview conducted in Berlin on Wednesday and to be released in full online later Thursday.

Mr. Navalny spent those two days in a coma in a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk, where Russian doctors said they found no trace of any poisoning, before being transported to Berlin for treatment. German chemical weapons experts determined that he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok — findings corroborated by labs in France and Sweden.

The nerve agent used in the attack was the same class of poison that Britain said was used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in 2018. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the poisoning an attempted murder and she and other world leaders have demanded that Russia fully investigate the case.

Russia has bristled at the demands for an investigation, saying that Germany needs to share medical data in the case or compare notes with Russian doctors. Germany has noted that Russian doctors have their own samples from Navalny since he was in their care for 48 hours.

Germany has also enlisted the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for technical assistance. The agency has collected independent samples from Navalny for testing, but results haven’t yet been announced.

German doctors have said Navalny could make a full recovery, though haven’t ruled out the possibility of long-term damage from the nerve agent.

Spiegel said Navalny was joking and alert in the interview with them, though his hands shook so much it was difficult for him to drink from a bottle of water. He also reiterated what his team has previously said — that he planned on returning to Russia when he was able.

“My job now is to remain the guy who isn’t scared, he was quoted as saying.

26,2020/10/01,"Assange bugged while at Ecuadorian Embassy, UK court told","The WikiLeaks founder faced an intensifying bugging operation from 2017 after Donald Trump became U.S. President, witnesses say

Julian Assange’s conversations in the latter part of his 7-year stay at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London were systematically bugged, even in the toilet, a London court heard Wednesday.

In written statements at Assange’s extradition hearing, two anonymous witnesses who worked for a Spanish firm with a security contract at the embassy said the WikiLeaks founder faced an intensifying bugging operation from 2017 onwards after Donald Trump became U.S. president.

Timeline of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s exposés and his stay in Ecuador embassy in London

Judge Vanessa Baraitser on Tuesday granted the two witnesses anonymity amid fears for their safety. Lawyers acting on behalf of the U.S. government did not contest the submission of the anonymous statements but said they were largely irrelevant to the matter under consideration in London’s Old Bailey court.

The two witnesses alleged that David Morales, the director of Spanish security firm Undercover Global, switched to the dark side and had instructed the installation of cameras with sophisticated audio capabilities to secretly record Assange’s meetings at the embassy, particularly those with his lawyers.

Assange lived in the embassy for seven years from 2012 after seeking refuge there while fearing his potential extradition to the U.S. He was evicted in April 2019 and has been in a London prison since.

The anonymous witnesses both claimed that Morales said the surveillance was initiated at the behest of our American friends” and that he had been handsomely rewarded.

One of the witnesses said Morales traveled to Las Vegas around July 2016 to showcase the security firm and subsequently obtained a flashy contract with the Las Vegas Sands, which was owned by Sheldon Adelson, a wealthy associate of Trump’s.

After returning from one of his trips to the United States, David Morales gathered all the workers in the office in Jerez and told us that ‘We have moved up and from now on we will be playing in the big league,’ the witness said.

The other anonymous witness, who was employed as an IT expert from 2015, alleged that while in Jerez, the city in southern Spain where UC Global’s had its headquarters, Morales had said in December 2017 that the Americans were desperate. The witness said a suggestion was made that “more extreme measures should be employed against the ‘guest’ to put an end to the situation of Assange’s permanence in the embassy.

Specifically, the witness said the idea was raised for the door to the embassy being left open, which would allow the argument that this had been an accidental mistake, which would allow persons to enter from outside the embassy and kidnap the asylee. There was, the witness claimed, even a suggestion that Assange could be poisoned.

All of these suggestions Morales said were under consideration during his dealing with his contacts in the United States, the witness said.

The witness also alleged that Morales had asked him soon after to install a microphone in an extinguisher in an embassy meeting room, as well as in a toilet where Assange had been holding meetings due to concern he was the target of espionage.

“I used a nearby socket to conceal a microphone in a cable in the toilet in the back of the embassy,” the witness said. This was never removed, and may still be there. U.S. prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Assange on 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over WikiLeaks’ publication of secret American military documents a decade ago. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.

Assange’s defense team says he is entitled to First Amendment protections for the publication of leaked documents that exposed U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have also said he is suffering from wide-ranging mental health issues, including suicidal tendencies, that could be exacerbated if he ends up in inhospitable prison conditions in the U.S.

The Indian embassy in Madagascar will go solar on October 2, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, becoming the first Indian mission globally to become clean and green with this installation.

The Indian Embassy in Antananarivo will have an installation of 8 KW of solar power plant on its rooftop, the mission said in a statement.

Indian embassy in Antananarivo is going to be the first embassy in Madagascar to go solar on October 2, 2020, on the occasion of the grand finale of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the statement said.

Both India and Madagascar are members of the International Solar Alliance which aims to promote solar energy to fight climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution, it said.

In pursuit of a “clean and green Embassy”, it undertook the project to install solar panels on its roof top to switch to solar energy.

The solar power “clean and green” Indian Embassy will be jointly inaugurated on October 2 by Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development of Madagascar Raharinirina Baomiavotse Vahinala and Indian Ambassador Abhay Kumar.

The event, which will be streamed on social media platforms, will also be attended by Resident Representative of UN Development Programme (UNDP) Marie Dimond, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Country Representative Volatiana Rakotondrazafy, Country Director of World Wide Fund (WWF) Nanie Ratsifandrihamanana and Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Madagascar Moumini Ouédraogo.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/y0kdcr/article30740747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05FEBTH--SOLAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indian-embassy-in-madagascar-to-go-solar-on-october-2/article32738885.ece
28,2020/10/01,Twitter removes 130 accounts disrupting public conversation during Trump-Biden debate,"Social media companies have long been under pressure to combat misinformation after U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russia used their platforms to meddle in the 2016 vote, allegations that Moscow has denied

Twitter Inc said on Wednesday it had removed 130 accounts, as they were attempting to disrupt the public conversation during the first U.S. presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.

Twitter removed the accounts, which appeared to originate in Iran, “based on intel” provided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), it said in a tweet

The accounts had very low engagement and did not make an impact on the public conversation, the social media giant said, adding, that the accounts and their content will be published in full once the investigation is complete.

One of the tweet was worded “are You watching For Fun too?”, showing graphical representation on why voters would plan to watch the debate, according to a sample tweet shared by Twitter.

Last week, Twitter said it worked with Facebook Inc to identify and remove 350 accounts which could be used by Russia's intelligence services to leak hacked documents as part of efforts to disrupt the upcoming U.S. election.

Both companies said one of the networks had been identified following a tip from the FBI, which warned that foreign actors and cybercriminals were likely to spread disinformation about the results of the Nov. 3 election.

Over the last two years, since the 2018 U.S. midterm election, senior U.S. intelligence officials have openly predicted that hackers associated with Russia, China, Iran and North Korea would attempt to target the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

29,2020/10/01,"Top U.S. airlines starting 32,000 furloughs as bailout hopes fade","American Airlines will furlough 19,000 employees, including some 1,600 pilots.

American Airlines and United Airlines, two of the largest U.S. carriers, said they were beginning furloughs of over 32,000 workers on Thursday as hopes faded for a last-minute bailout from Washington.

Both airlines told employees, however, in memos seen by Reuters on Wednesday that they stood ready to reverse the furloughs, which affect about 13% of their workforces before the pandemic, if a deal was reached.

Tens of thousands of other employees at those airlines and others including Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines have accepted buyouts or leaves of absence aimed at reducing headcount as carriers battle a health crisis that has upended the global travel industry.

U.S. airlines have been pleading for another $25 billion in payroll support to protect jobs for a further six months once the current package, which banned furloughs, expires at midnight.

Earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi had made progress on a bipartisan aid plan, although no deal was reached and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief proposal “outlandish.”

In a memo to employees, American Chief Executive Doug Parker said Mnuchin told him that he and Pelosi were continuing to negotiate on a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package that would include an extension of aid for airlines and could reach an agreement in coming days. “Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that any of these efforts will come to fruition,” Parker said.

American will furlough 19,000 employees, including some 1,600 pilots. More than 13,000 United employees will be on furlough, but not any pilots following an agreement reached this week.

“Tomorrow, tens of thousands of essential aviation workers will wake up without a job or healthcare and tens of thousands more will be without a paycheck,” Association of Flight Attendants-CWA President Sara Nelson said in a statement that urged lawmakers to reach a deal.

Nick Calio, who heads the airline trade group Airlines for America, said earlier that the industry was still pursuing all potential avenues for new assistance as time runs short.

“People keep talking, but we need results,” Calio told Reuters. “We are hopeful but not confident about them reaching a deal on a larger bill.”

U.S. airline shares ended flat on Wednesday.

Weeks of intense airline lobbying has won over many but not all Washington lawmakers, while drawing attention to the plight of other pandemic-hit industries as the crisis persists.

U.S. airlines are operating about half their 2019 flying schedules and suffering a 68% decline in passenger volumes.

The impact of the coronavirus on travel may cost as many as 46 million jobs globally, according to projections published on Wednesday by the Air Transport Action Group.

Airlines have argued they need trained employees to help drive an economic recovery as the pandemic subsides.

30,2020/10/01,Tensions mount as Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces fight for fourth day,"Azerbaijan said 14 Azeri civilians had been killed since fighting began on Sunday, and released footage showing grey smoke rising from inside Nagorno-Karabakh as it was pounded by Azeri artillery.

NATO allies France and Turkey traded angry recriminations on Wednesday as international tensions mounted over the fiercest clashes between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces since the mid-1990s.

On the fourth day of fighting, Azerbaijan and the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh accused each other of shelling along the line of contact that divides them.

Dozens have been reported killed and hundreds wounded in fighting since Sunday that has spread far beyond the enclave's borders, threatening to spill over into all-out war between the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia.

The Hindu Explains | What’s behind the Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes?

The defence ministry of the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh said it could report 23 more casualties on Wednesday.

The skirmishes have raised concerns about stability in the South Caucasus region, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets, and raised fears that regional powers Russia and Turkey could be drawn in.

Some of Turkey's NATO allies are increasingly alarmed by Ankara's stance on Nagorno-Karabakh.

Echoing remarks by President Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday Turkey would “do what is necessary” when asked whether Ankara would offer military support if Azerbaijan requested it.

Cavusoglu also said French solidarity with Armenia amounted to supporting Armenian occupation in Azerbaijan.

French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country is home to many people of Armenian ancestry, hit back during a visit to Latvia. He said France was extremely concerned by “warlike messages” from Turkey “which essentially remove any of Azerbaijan's inhibitions in reconquering Nagorno-Karabakh”.

“And that we won't accept,” he said.

New reports of fighting

Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave, broke away from Azerbaijan in the 1990s in a war that killed an estimated 30,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands.

In Wednesday's clashes, the latest in decades of conflict, Armenian media said three civilians had been killed and several wounded by shelling in the town of Martakert in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Azerbaijan said 14 Azeri civilians had been killed since fighting began on Sunday, and released footage showing grey smoke rising from inside Nagorno-Karabakh as it was pounded by Azeri artillery. Photographs taken in the Azeri town of Terter showed people taking cover in dug-outs, and damaged buildings which residents said had been hit by Armenian shells.

Azerbaijan said ethnic Armenian forces attempted to recover lost ground by launching counter-attacks in the direction of Madagiz, but Azeri forces repelled the attack.

Armenia said the Azeri army had been shelling the whole front line during the night and two Azeri drones were shot down over Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh's administrative centre. It was not possible to independently confirm the report.

In the latest telephone diplomacy, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan spoke to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, whose country shares borders with both Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Rouhani expressed concern about the rising tensions, the Armenian government said, but gave no further details.

Pashinyan said he was not considering asking for Russia's help at this point under a post-Soviet security treaty, but did not rule out doing so.

He said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had not discussed the possibility of Russian military intervention when they spoke by telephone on Tuesday.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday Russia's military was closely following developments.

Armenia's unified information centre, an online governmental platform, posted pictures of the wreckage of what it said was a SU-25 warplane shot down by a Turkish fighter jet on Tuesday.

Turkey denied downing the plane.

31,2020/10/01,6 rockets land near Erbil airport hours after Iraqi PM pledges to protect diplomats,"The Iraqi military blamed a “terrorist group” for the attack and said there were no casualties.

Iran-backed militias launched rockets targeting U.S. troops that landed near Erbil airport in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, a Kurdish security agency said on Wednesday, hours after Iraq's premier pledged to protect foreign missions.

Iraqi Kurdistan's counterterrorism service blamed the attack on the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an umbrella grouping of mostly Iran-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militias that is part of Iraq's armed forces.

“Six rockets were launched from the borders of the Sheikh Amir village in Nineveh province by the Popular Mobilisation Forces who were targeting (U.S.-led) coalition forces in Erbil International Airport,” the service said.

Four rockets landed at the edge of the airport compound and two did not explode, it added in a statement.

The Kurdish interior ministry condemned the attack, which it said took place at 8:30 p.m. It did not directly blame the PMF but said the rockets were launched from an area under the jurisdiction of the PMF's 30th Brigade.

U.S. Army Colonel Wayne Marotto, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, said initial reports were that indirect fire did not land on coalition forces in Erbil. “There was no damage or casualties. Incident is under investigation,” he posted on Twitter.

No group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, which occurred hours after Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi pledged in a meeting with top diplomats to protect foreign missions and limit possession of weapons to state forces following a U.S. threat to shut down its embassy in Baghdad.

“Those who carry out attacks on foreign missions are seeking to destabilise Iraq and sabotage its regional and international relations,” Kadhimi told 25 foreign emissaries, including the U.S. ambassador, earlier on Wednesday.

Sirens were heard inside a nearby military base housing U.S. troops, Kurdish media said. A rocket fell 200 metres (220 yards) away from a Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI) base, spokesman Mohamed Qadiri told Reuters. It was not clear if the KDPI was an intentional target.

Media reports had suggested Washington could move diplomatic staff to Erbil, with the Kurdistan Region long seen as a safe haven from the violence gripping the rest of Iraq and far from the reaches of the Iran-backed Iraqi militias the United States blames for increasingly regular attacks on its interests.

Kurdish Prime Minister Masrour Barzani condemned the attack and called on Kadhimi to hold those responsible accountable.

“I strongly condemn tonight's rocket attack in Erbil. The KRG will not tolerate any attempt to undermine Kurdistan's stability and our response will be robust,” Barzani, who leads the Kurdistan Regional Government, wrote on Twitter.

“I have spoken to PM Mustafa al-Kadhimi on the importance of holding the perpetrators accountable,” he said.

The Iraqi military blamed a “terrorist group” for the attack and said there were no casualties. The local commanders responsible for securing the launch area have been arrested pending an investigation, it said in a statement.

A security source said two men were arrested: an Iraqi army brigadier general and the commander of the PMF's 30th Brigade.

The United States has made preparations to withdraw diplomats from Iraq after warning Baghdad it could shut its embassy, two Iraqi officials and two Western diplomats said, a step Iraqis fear could turn their country into a battle zone.

Rockets regularly fly across the Tigris towards the heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic compound.

In recent weeks rocket attacks near the embassy have increased and roadside bombs targeted convoys carrying equipment to the U.S.-led military coalition. One roadside attack hit a British convoy in Baghdad, the first of its kind against Western diplomats in Iraq for years.

On Monday three children and two women were killed when two militia rockets hit a family home, the Iraqi military said. Police sources said Baghdad airport was the intended target.

Washington blames such attacks on Iranian-backed militia groups. Iran has not directly commented on the incidents but groups believed to be connected to Iran-aligned militias have claimed responsibility for some attacks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sifgdf/article32738195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1500x500,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6-rockets-land-near-erbil-airport-hours-after-iraqi-pm-pledges-to-protect-diplomats/article32738196.ece
32,2020/10/01,Russia reports 'non-standard' air leak on International Space Station,"NASA said that the leak had appeared to grow in size overnight Monday to Tuesday and the crew were awakened by flight controllers to carry out a search.

Russia said Tuesday that astronauts had found an air leak in its section of the International Space Station, with a senior space official calling the air loss beyond expected levels.

The crew on the ISS — Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Christopher Cassidy — have been searching for the air leak since August, first checking the U.S. segment.

Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, said in a statement that after analysis and a search for the leak “it was established that the spot is located in the Zvezda (star) service module, which contains scientific equipment.”

It said a search was now underfoot to pinpoint the exact location, saying the situation “is not dangerous for the life and health of the ISS crew and does not prevent the ISS continuing manned flight.”

“It's not critical in the near future,” said Sergei Krikalyov, the executive director of Russia's manned space programmes, in a televised comment.

He said the ISS always has slight air loss due to the air purifying system.

“These leaks are predictable. What's happening now is more than the standard leakage and naturally if it lasts a long time, it will require supplies of extra air to the station,” he said.

He said the crew were now resting but hoped to find the precise spot and fix the leak on Wednesday.

“That's not for sure,” he added, saying there was quite a large area to search. “We have time. The leak exists of course. It's not good that it's there, but it's not critical,” he said.

NASA said that the leak had appeared to grow in size overnight Monday to Tuesday and the crew were awakened by flight controllers to carry out a search.

It was later found that a temperature change had made the leak seem to grow, while the rate of air escaping was “unchanged,” the U.S. space agency said.

Previously, astronauts had searched for the source of the leak in the U.S. segment of the station using an ultrasound detector.

The incident comes after astronauts in 2018 found a hole in the wall of a Russian-made Soyuz space capsule docked onto the ISS.

The cause of the hole has not yet been made public.

Three new crew members, Russians Sergei Ryzhikov and Sergei Kud-Sverchkov and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, are set to arrive in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft due to launch October 14.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/vkf7rv/article26423945.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPACE-NASA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russia-reports-non-standard-air-leak-on-international-space-station/article32738188.ece
33,2020/10/01,"Australia’s participation in Malabar Exercise still under discussion, says U.S. official","October meeting of Quad countries to cover a host of issues including defence, economic areas and COVID-19.

The inclusion of Australia in the Malabar Exercise - trilateral naval exercises between India, the U.S. and Japan – was still being discussed, a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters on a briefing call on Wednesday . The official’s remarks also included India-U.S. interactions at multilateral forums, Amnesty International India halting its activities and the India-China border standoff.

Regarding the October ministerial-level meeting of the “Quad”- India, Australia, the U.S. and Japan – the countries will discuss a comprehensive set of issues, but the actual agenda is going to be kept “close-hold” [ a security classification] among the countries, the official said, so there can be a more “frank and open” discussion of those issues.

The official, who called the Quad partnership “increasingly strong,” said that the agenda would cover defence, economic areas and, especially, COVID-19.

India has been reluctant to include Australia in the Malabar naval exercises which include three of the four Quad members. A militarisation of the Quad could be viewed by China as a strategy to contain it, not something India has wanted to do.

The official said that discussions were still on-going on whether or not Australia would join the other three countries in the exercises, to be held this year in the Bay of Bengal.

The agenda for the U.S.-India October 2+2 ministerial dialogue (defence and foreign affairs ministers of both countries) is currently being worked out and is expected to be “comprehensive, wide-ranging and strategic,” the official said. It will include defence topics, diplomatic cooperation, cooperation at multilateral forums, economic cooperation, space and technology and people to people cooperation, as per the official.

Providing an overview of the ‘U.S. – India Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership’ (the official framework for the relationship between the two countries), the official called the relationship, “one of the most important partnerships in the world.”

“Perhaps the clearest example of how the U.S.- India partnership has benefitted the world is in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the official said.

Support for India’s permanent UNSC Seat

At a meeting held during UN High Level Week last week, India and other G4 countries (Brazil, Germany and Japan) declared that they were looking for text-based negotiations and results within specified time frames for U.N Security Council reform.

The U.S. has supported India’s quest for a permanent seat on the Security Council. This was reiterated on Wednesday.

“The United States welcomes India joining the UN Security Council in 2021 for a two-year term, and supports a reformed UN Security Council that includes India as a permanent member,” the official said in response to questions on how the U.S. would support India’s bid for a permanent seat at the Council.

Opposed to incursions

Responding to a question on whether the U.S. would take a stand on the location of the disputed border between India and China and support India’s position, the official said, “We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to advanced territorial claims by incursions ( by military or civilian incursions) across the border, or across the established line of actual control.”

“ And the disputed boundaries: all we can say is that we encourage India and China to use their existing bilateral channels to discuss those and not resort to military force.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w96cgw/article32588281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MALABARTRILATERALNAVALEXERCISE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australias-participation-in-malabar-exercise-still-under-discussion-says-us-official/article32737903.ece

The issue has received attention at the “highest levels” of the U.S. government, as per a senior State Department official.

“On the situation involving Amnesty International in India… we’ve been very, very closely following this issue, not just in the administration, but I know that our members of Congress have as well. It has received attention at the highest levels of our government,” the official said while briefing reporters on the India-U.S. relationship.

“The United States is committed to the health and vibrancy of civil society in all countries, but also especially India. We believe that the strength of civil society and the openness of society is a strength of India and it’s something that is part of what powers our cooperation, our bilateral cooperation,” the official said.

“And therefore we’re concerned about obstacles to the work of civil society, whether in India or anywhere else in the world. So we’re following it closely and we look forward to a response and a resolution to this situation that’s consistent with international principles and the rule of law.”

Days ago, the Amnesty International India announced that it was halting its operations and had to let go of staff.

“The constant harassment by government agencies including the Enforcement Directorate is a result of our unequivocal calls for transparency in the government, more recently for accountability of the Delhi police and the government of India regarding the grave human rights violations in Delhi riots and Jammu & Kashmir,” Amnesty International India’s Executive Director Avinash Kumar had said.

35,2020/10/01,"Trump attempts damage control, asks right wing militias to ‘stand down’","He drew criticism earlier when he failed to condemn white supremacists.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on right-wing militias to “stand down” and let police “do their work” in an apparent attempt at damage control after failing to condemn such groups on the debate stage a day earlier.

Mr. Trump drew outrage after he dodged an opportunity to condemn white supremacists, and instead dropped the name of a far-right militia group — the Proud Boys — during his first presidential debate against Joe Biden on Tuesday night.

“I don't know who Proud Boys are but whoever they are they have to stand down,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “Stand down, let law enforcement do their work,” he said. “Whoever they are, stand down.”

Mr. Biden had branded Mr. Trump a “national embarrassment” for failing to explicitly denounce white supremacist groups, as the president moved to quell the storm sparked by his remarks on the debate stage.

The bitter adversaries returned to the campaign trail one day after their off-the-rails showdown in Cleveland made headlines less for the substance than for its unrestrained chaos.

The toxic shout fest — with Mr. Trump constantly interrupting and Mr. Biden launching personal attacks — even prompted the overseeing Commission on Presidential Debates to announce it would be imposing new measures to help moderators “maintain order” at the upcoming two debates.

After his assertive performance, Mr. Biden launched a whistlestop train tour Wednesday through battleground states Ohio and Pennsylvania where he renewed his criticism of Trump.

“The president of the United States conducted himself the way he did — I think it was a national embarrassment,” Mr. Biden said in Alliance, Ohio.

He fiercely attacked Mr. Trump's failure to make a clear and forceful denunciation of white supremacist groups or the far-right Proud Boys, instead giving a shout-out to the male-only militia group by saying they should “stand back and stand by,” and that the real problem is “far-left” extremists.

“My message to the Proud Boys and every other white supremacist group is: cease and desist,” Mr. Biden said. “That's not who we are. This is not who we are as Americans.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a15l5l/article32710961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THAPTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-attempts-damage-control-asks-right-wing-militias-to-stand-down/article32736836.ece
36,2020/10/01,Bihar Assembly polls | NDA seat-sharing meeting inconclusive,"BJP and LJP may come to an agreement before October 4

No announcement was forthcoming on the National Democratic Alliance’s seat-sharing agreement for the Bihar Assembly polls despite a 50-minute-long meeting between Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP president J.P. Nadda and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Chirag Paswan. But with time running out, a tentative date for a meeting of the BJP’s central election committee has been fixed for October 4. The seat-sharing agreement will, in all likelihood, be settled before that date.

Mr. Paswan met Mr. Shah and Mr. Nadda at the latter’s residence in New Delhi, even as the other partner in the alliance, the Janata Dal (United) made it clear that it was the BJP’s job to sort out the seat-sharing arrangement with the LJP.

The LJP has been demanding at least 36-40 seats considering that it won six Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 elections. Mr. Paswan has said that he has no issues with the BJP but does not support the candidature of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as the face of the NDA in the State. He has said that he was also contemplating putting up 143 candidates from his party, but only in seats where the JD(U) was fighting.

BJP sources said that much of the talk was for positioning and the political space that Mr. Paswan feels his party should occupy. Mr. Shah and Mr. Nadda will be meeting Mr. Paswan again soon as Thursday’s meeting remained inconclusive. “Chirag Paswan spoke his heart out and Amit bhai and Naddaji heard him patiently. We hope for an announcement very soon,” said a source.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/whjb3k/article32591782.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMITSHAH,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/nda-seat-sharing-meeting-for-bihar-polls-inconclusive/article32746377.ece

At the meeting of the Congress screening committee held ahead of the Bihar polls, a section of party leaders expressed the view that the Congress should not wait any longer for the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) to make up its mind on the seat sharing formula for the mahagatbandhan (grand alliance). Sources said that, so far, no consensus has emerged within the party.

The last date for nomination to the first phase of the Assembly election is October 8. Seventy-one seats in 16 districts go to polls in the first phase on October 28. The Congress screening committee had a meeting on Wednesday from 3 p.m till 7 p.m. Another round of meetings was held on Thursday.

The Congress has been demanding nearly 70 seats; the RJD wants to concede only close to 60. The Congress fought on 42 seats in the 2015 Assembly elections, with Janata Dal-United (JD-U) candidates fighting on a Congress symbol in a couple of them. The RJD’s argument is that the Congress does not have enough ground presence to even come up with a suitable candidate for all seats.

A senior Congress leader said, “We had almost finalised the seat arrangement, but in this land of Chanakya, the political situation changes every minute. It is not about the number, it is about the ideological commitment. The problem is with their attitude, which drove away Jitan Ram Manjhi [Hindustan Awam Morcha] and then Upendera Kushwaha [Rashtriya Lok Samata Party].”

The party has also been egged on by others to patch up the third front, what a section of the party says is the “true secular front”. A narrative that the RJD is being manipulated by the Bharatiya Janata Party, since its president Lalu Prasad Yadav’s bail plea is up for a hearing on October 9, is also taking root.

Another section of the party feels that the divorce with the RJD should have happened six months and not six days ahead of the nominations. “We are back to square one and a repeat of what happened in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is happening once more. This is the time to build the alliance not bicker,” another Congress leader added.

38,2020/10/01,Madras Photo Bloggers presents a photography course for the hearing impaired,"Madras Photo Bloggers presents a photography course for the hearing impaired where most of the teaching will happen through sign language

“A silent way to learn”: this is how travel photographer and founder of Madras Photo Bloggers (MPB), Srivatsan Sankaran describes their photography course for the hearing impaired.

Srivatsan, who has conducted several workshops for the hearing community, feels that those who are hearing impaired, rely largely on “practical understandings”. Most photography resources, he points out, are in English, which can be a problem.

“If communication is challenging, they do not feel encouraged to read,” he adds. Which is why he, along with documentary photographer Ayyalu R Kumaran, who is also from MPB, came up with a course in sign language with Ravi Shankar Y, an interpreter.

The facilitators will communicate through sign language, using body language, facial expression and practical ways of teaching. “Kumaran and I believe in listening,” says Srivatsan. “We will first listen to the participants to understand their level of knowledge before we start teaching.” He explains that they plan to keep batches small, consisting of eight to 10 people.

The three-month-long course will not only teach photography, but will also try to imbibe confidence in the participants. “Attitude towards challenges need to be changed and so, we will slowly introduce optimistic thinking,” he says, adding that they hope to train the participants to tackle obstacles.

Speaking of challenges, Srivatsan too has faced a lot of them. Hearing impaired himself, he says that initially as a photographer, he felt frustrated and angry at times, “which never lead to any solution”.

“Challenges emerge in various forms: communication, confidence, understandings and listening, because all these play a crucial role in processing information,” he says. The 30-year-old realised this after his experiences in teaching photography, solo travel photography expeditions, interacting with clients, organising events, leading his team and communicating over phone.

“Over years of training my mind, I’m able to withstand any sort of challenge that I come across in both professional and personal life,” he says. In the end, this is what he and Kumaran hope to teach.

The three-month course is online and starts on October 2. It is on from 10 am to 4 pm every weekend. Course fee is ₹5,000. A camera will be provided if participants do not own one.

39,2020/10/01,Maruti leads jump in auto wholesales,"Expectations of an improvement in consumer sentiment, shift to personal mobility spur Sept. sales

Wholesale sales of passenger vehicles and two-wheelers posted growth for a second straight month in September driven by expectations of higher demand on account of an anticipated improvement in consumer sentiment during Diwali and a growing shift towards personal mobility as a result of COVID-19.

Market leader Maruti Suzuki’s dispatches to dealers surged 34% year-on-year to more than 1.47 lakh vehicles.

“With total sales of 3,93,130 units in Q2, the company registered a growth of 16.2% over the same period previous year, on a lower base,” the automaker said in a statement. “The company closed H1 with total sales of 4,69,729 units, a decline of 36.6%. Sales performance in the first half has to be seen in conjunction with COVID-19 related disruptions,” Maruti Suzuki added.

Hyundai India said domestic sales rose 23.6% to 50,313 units. But exports fell 43.5% to 9,600 units.

“In the changing business environment, the green shoots of recovery are clearly visible with sales improving on a month-on-month as well as year-on-year basis,” said Hyundai Motor India director (Sales, Marketing & Service) Tarun Garg.

Mahindra & Mahindra sold 14,857 passenger vehicles (PVs), a growth of 4%. Domestic tractor sales jumped 18% to 42,361 units.

Tata Motors’ domestic PV sales more than doubled to 21,199 units. Shailesh Chandra, president, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, said, “PV industry witnessed recovery in Q2, supported by festive sales in some regions and continued benefit from pent-up demand across the country. In September, wholesales were higher than retail”. Domestic commercial vehicle sales, however, fell 4% to 23,245 units.

Mitul Shah, vice president (Research) at Reliance Securities said monthly volume performance by most automobile companies was encouraging. “Improving sentiment, favourable monsoon, higher agri output, all these factors coupled with increased enquiry levels indicate strong auto sales during upcoming two months of festive season,” he added.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor sold 8,116 cars, lower than the 10,203 units it sold locally in September 2019.

Hero raises prices

Hero MotoCorp’s sales rose 16.9% to more than 7.15 lakh units. The country’s largest two-wheeler maker also raised the ex-showroom prices of its motorcycles and scooters by up to 2% to partly offset rising input costs.

Rival Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India said wholesale sales rose 10% to surpass 5 lakh units.

Chennai-based TVS Motor said domestic two-wheeler sales at 2.41 lakh units in September 2020, was lower than the about 2.43 lakh units sold in the year-earlier period.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/b6xebp/article32747388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THBUMARUTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/maruti-leads-jump-in-auto-wholesales/article32747389.ece

British premium bikemaker Triumph Motorcycles has drawn up plans to achieve 20% sales growth during the current fiscal ending June 2021, said a top official.

“While the premium bike market has contracted by 30% to 35%, we have started seeing growth,” said Shoeb Farooq, business head, Triumph Motorcycles India.

“Our sales since June 2020 is similar to that of last year,” said Mr. Farooq.“We are hoping to sell 1,000 bikes this year (July to June 2021) against about 800 units sold last year.”

“We are bullish on India. It offers lot of opportunities. We have drawn up both short-term and long-term plans. First is the expansion of branch network from the current 14 to 16 within a year and then roll out high-end bikes from January 2021 and new set of segment bikes by mid-2022,” he said.

Tirumph plans to take on the Japanese majors with the introduction launch of its Trident 650cc middle way naked roadsters that is production ready. It will be rolled out in India by the first quarter of 2021. It has a in-line, three-cyclinder engine. Besides, Tirumph also plans to unveillaunch some more models before June next year2021.

Regarding its non-equity joint venture tie-up with Bajaj Auto, he said it will pave way for building a new mid-capacity motorcycle with a new engine on a new platform, ranging from 200cc to 700cc, at an aggressive price range of ₹2-2.5 lakh. It will be rolled out by mid-2022.

Asked about the high tax structure which many players were complaining about, he said that there was hardly any difference between completely knocked-down (CKDs) kits and completely-built units (CBUs). CKDs were assembled at Manesar while CBUs were made in Thailand. It was in the ratio of 50:50.

Mr. Farooq said showroom expansion was delayed due to COVID-19. While they had earlier decided to open four branches, it was reduced to two to consolidate sales. The new branches will be opened within 12 months, taking the total to 14.

(HUL) have unveiled a joint pilot project in Mumbai and Bengaluru to provide digital payment and financing solutions to small retailers. This partnership will help digitally empower HUL’s retailers and distributors through SBI’s customised online seamless solutions. Once successful, this project will be scaled up pan-India, covering millions of retailers dealing with HUL products.

43,2020/10/01,AWS announces general availability of Amazon Timestream,"Amazon Web Services Inc. (AWS) on Thursday announced the general availability of Amazon Timestream, a new time-series database for IoT and operational applications that can scale to process trillions of time series events per day up to 1,000 times faster than relational databases, and at as low as 1/10th the cost.

44,2020/10/01,India’s Sept. manufacturing PMI sees fastest pace of growth in over 8 years,"The upturn in total sales was supported by a renewed expansion in new export orders, the first since prior to the escalation of the COVID-19 outbreak.

India’s manufacturing sector activity improved for the second straight month in September and touched an over eight-and-a-half-year high supported by accelerated increases in new orders and production, even as firms reduced staff numbers, a monthly survey said on Thursday.

The headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) increased from 52.0 in August to 56.8 in September — highest since January 2012.

Also read: Parley | Can India decouple itself from Chinese manufacturing?

“The Indian manufacturing industry continued to move in the right direction, with PMI data for September highlighting many positives. Due to loosened COVID-19 restrictions, factories went full steam ahead for production, supported by a surge in new work,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.

In April, the index had slipped into contraction mode, after remaining in the growth territory for 32 consecutive months. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.

Uptrend in exports

The upturn in total sales was supported by a renewed expansion in new export orders, the first since prior to the escalation of the COVID-19 outbreak.

“Exports also bounced back, following six successive months of contraction, while inputs were purchased at a sharper rate and business confidence strengthened,” Lima said.

Despite strong growth of order book volumes, Indian goods producers signalled another reduction in payroll numbers. In many cases, this was attributed to efforts to observe social distancing guidelines. Employment has now decreased for six consecutive months.

“One area that lagged behind, however, was employment. Some companies reported difficulties in hiring workers, while others suggested that staff numbers had been kept to a minimum amid efforts to observe social distancing guidelines,” Lima noted.

On the prices front, output prices rose for the first time in six months, reflecting an uptick in input costs, the survey said.

Looking ahead, almost one-third of manufacturers expect output growth in the coming 12 months, against 8 per cent that foresee a contraction, resulting in the strongest degree of overall optimism in over four years.

“When we look at the PMI average for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020/21, the result is in stark contrast to that seen in the first quarter: a rise from 35.1 to 51.6. While uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic remains, producers can at least for now enjoy the recovery,” Lima said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ihtbw4/article17389118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02PMI3,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indias-sept-manufacturing-pmi-sees-fastest-pace-of-growth-in-over-8-years/article32739692.ece

47,2020/10/01,Nine BJP workers resign in Leh,"Leaders upset after party fields newcomers in council polls

Nine leaders and workers of the BJP have resigned from the party in Ladakh’s Leh district in the past two days, after the party selected 10 new faces to contest the upcoming polls to the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council-Leh (LAHDC-Leh).

Also read: Border tension casts shadow over Ladakh council poll

“The party has chosen candidates on the basis of their winnability and report card from the ground. We have introduced around 10 new faces,” Dr. Skalzang Dorjey, political affairs in-charge of the BJP, told The Hindu over the phone.

The council polls are scheduled for October 16.

The BJP’s move has upset many leaders and workers within the party. Four councillors, who contested and won the polls five years ago, were among the nine who quit.

“The BJP has done favouritism by not choosing the right candidate for Chuchot seat. The BJP chose a candidate who can’t spell the LAHDC correctly. We can’t support him,” two workers, Manzoor Hussian and Mumtaz Hussian, wrote in a joint resignation letter.

Lobzang Nyantak, a BJP councillor, is among the four other councillors who quit the party.

‘Development first’

However, the BJP has downplayed the development. “The BJP remains the largest political party in Leh. It won’t compromise on its agenda of development. Leh saw developmental projects for the past six years,” Dr. Dorjey said.

Of 30 councillors elected to the LAHDC-Leh in 2015, around 18 were affiliated to the BJP.

This time, the BJP is going to the polls with the promise of backing the Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh to safeguard jobs, land and demography of the region. It has also called for further empowerment of the LAHDC-Leh.

“The BJP was part of an apex body that demanded the status of the Sixth Schedule. We have also written to the Lieutenant Governor to further empower the council,” he added.

Meanwhile, sources said the councillors who resigned from the BJP were likely to be fielded by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), a new entrant in Leh after regional forces such as the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party disbanded their offices following the August 5 move by the Centre to revoke J&K’s special status and grant Union Territory (UT) status to Ladakh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6je1e5/article29582912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BJP03,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nine-bjp-workers-resign-in-leh/article32746745.ece

“The NGOs are expected to adhere to all our laws, including with respect to foreign funding, just as they would in other countries like the U.S. and the European Union. We also expect that other governments would not condone the contravention of Indian laws by any entity,” said Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday.

Over the past few days, the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), the United Kingdom Foreign Office and the European Union have issued statements expressing concern over the government’s decision to freeze the Amnesty’s funds that led the international human rights agency to close its India office on September 29. Both the U.K. and the E.U. said they have raised concerns through bilateral diplomatic channels as well.

“The U.K.’s Minister for South Asia [Tariq Ahmed] and our Acting High Commissioner in New Delhi met Indian government representatives after Amnesty International India’s accounts were frozen, to emphasise the importance of organisations like this being able to continue their important work,” said a British High Commission spokesperson, adding that “the U.K. is seeking further information on recent decisions affecting Amnesty and believes the freedom of civil society organisations to operate underpins any functioning democracy”.

The U.S. State Department also issued a statement saying the moves on Amnesty International had been noted “at the highest levels” of the U.S. government as well as by members of the U.S. Congress, adding that the U.S. is “concerned about obstacles to the work of civil society, whether in India or anywhere else in the world”. The E.U. had issued a similar statement on Tuesday.

In a detailed note earlier this week, the Ministry of Home Affairs had explained that its actions to freeze the funds of the Amnesty International India’s office related to several investigations carried out by different agencies including the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI over the past decade. The government said having failed to receive registration under the Foreign Contributions Regulatory Act (FCRA) meant for Non-Governmental Organisations, the Amnesty had taken the “commercial route” and accepted funds through Foreign Direct Investment, which is a contravention of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).

However, the Amnesty International has repeatedly denied the charge claiming its actions were “entirely legitimate”. “This decision was not motivated by any question of law as the Indian authorities now claim. It is not about Amnesty India’s sources of funding, which are entirely legitimate and involved no lawbreaking. This is punishment for standing up for humanity’s core values in the world’s largest democracy,” wrote a Senior Director of Amnesty International in the U.K. newspaper The Guardian on Thursday.

India on Thursday strongly rejected Pakistan’s criticism of the acquittal of all the 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, saying it may be difficult for the neighbouring country, having a “coercive apparatus”, to understand the ethos of democracy and rule of law.

Pakistan Foreign Office on Wednesday condemned the acquittal of the accused in the case and urged the Indian government to ensure safety, security and protection of the minorities, particularly the Muslims and their places of worship.

“India is a mature democracy where the government and people abide by the verdicts of the court and show respect for the rule of law,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at an online media briefing while replying to a question on Pakistan’s reaction to the ruling.

“It may be difficult for a system with a coercive apparatus where people and the courts can be silenced at will of the establishment to understand such a democratic ethos,” he added.

54,2020/10/01,PM Modi to inaugurate strategic Atal Tunnel at Rohtang on Saturday,"The 9.02 km long tunnel has been designed for traffic density of 3000 cars per day and 1,500 trucks per day with max speed of 80 kmph

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the strategically important all-weather Atal Tunnel, which reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km and the travel time by four to five hours, at Rohtang in Himachal Pradesh on Saturday. After the inauguration function, Mr. Modi will also attend public functions at Sissu in Lahaul Spiti and at Solang Valley, the Prime Minister’s Office said on Thursday.

Atal Tunnel is the longest highway tunnel in the world, and the 9.02 km long tunnel connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year, the PMO said, noting that the valley was earlier cut off for about six months every year due to heavy snowfall.

The tunnel is built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas at an altitude of 3000 metres (10,000 feet) from the Mean Sea Level (MSL).

The south portal (SP) of Atal Tunnel is located at a distance of 25 km from Manali at an altitude of 3,060 metres, while the north portal (NP) of the tunnel is located near village Teling, Sissu, in Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 3,071 metres.

Watch | Atal tunnel: The world's longest highway tunnel above 10,000 ft

It is a horse shoe shaped, single-tube double lane tunnel with a roadway of 8 metres and has an overhead clearance of 5.525 metres, the PMO said.

Atal Tunnel has been designed for traffic density of 3000 cars per day and 1,500 trucks per day with max speed of 80 kmph.

The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had taken the decision to construct the strategic tunnel below the Rohtang Pass on June 3, 2000, and the foundation stone for the access road to the south portal of the tunnel was laid on May 26, 2002.

The Modi government decided to name the Rohtang Tunnel as Atal Tunnel in December 2019 to honour the former prime minister who had passed away the previous year.

55,2020/10/01,"Coronavirus | Immunity for lesser time, change in ‘virulence’ of virus, say experts on September sero-survey results","The latest survey on prevalence of antibodies to COVID-19 among people in Delhi has shown a fall compared to the last exercise, with experts saying possible reasons could be immunity lasting for lesser time in people and “change in virulence” of the virus.

Coronavirus, October 1 updates

Virulence refers to the severity or harmfulness of a disease.

The findings of the survey conducted in the first week of September, with a representative sample of 17,409 people across various categories, was submitted to the Delhi High Court on September 30.

It found that sero-prevalence of antibodies to COVID-19 reduced to 25% in September from nearly 29% found in the August exercise in the national capital.

Medical Director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, a dedicated COVID-19 facility, said the fall in figures indicate that “immunity to the virus attack is not lasting beyond two months or so”.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

“It also means that we are far away from the desired herd immunity level. The decline in figures means the antibodies developed in response to the infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, are vanishing far earlier than expected. So, people need to more careful now,” he told PTI.

Dr. Sherwal conjectured this trend if persists means, when the vaccine comes for COVID-19, a patient would need to be given “power doses too” besides the “first dose”.

The survey also showed that there was a significant decrease in seroprevalence in northeast, north and central districts of Delhi, while there was a slight increase in south, east, west and northwest districts.

The sero-prevalence was found more in women during all the rounds of the survey and it was the least in the 18-49 years age group, as compared to age groups of less than 18 years and more than 50 years, the report said.

The survey also found that nearly one-third of the participants with a past history of COVID-19 infection, “did not have detectable IgG antibodies”.

“However, there is evidence that antibodies to COVID-19 may deplete over time,” it added.

Medical Director of LNJP Hospital, another dedicated COVID-19 facility run by the Delhi government, concurred with Dr. Sherwal that duration for which antibodies last, “seems to be reducing“.

“The fall in sero-prevalance level, if extrapolated, means people had antibodies earlier but it has disappeared now. Also, one other possible reason could be the change in virulence of the virus, so we don’t know how it going to behave now. Hence, people need to be more careful,” he said.

The national capital recorded 41 COVID-19 fatalities on September 30, as the toll climbed to 5,361, while 3,390 fresh cases took the tally to over 2.79 lakh.

On September 29, 48 deaths were reported, the highest number of fatalities recorded in a day since July 16, when the city saw 58 fatalities.

Dr. Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals in New Delhi, said, “fall in duration for which antibodies last seems to be a factor”.

“One of my patients, who had tested positive for COVID-19 in July and recovered had been found sero-positive when we went to donate plasma soon after. Recently, he again went to donate plasma but couldn’t as his sero-prevalance came negative, meaning his antibodies had vanished,” he said.

Dr. Chatterjee said, human bodies have two kinds of antibodies, one which is humoral or inherent one and the other one is cellular immunity which is in response to an infection.

IgM antibodies last for shorter duration, and IgG antibodies are for the long run, the Apollo hospital doctor said.

All three of them advised people to not be complacent about the COVID-19 situation, and still observe the same safety norms as earlier, with Chatterjee cautioning, “the WHO had already said that antibodies cannot be your passport to immunity”, and therefore people can’t afford to lower their guard.

The September survey report also stated that asymptomatic infections were manifested in most cases during all the sero-survey rounds and diabetes mellitus was observed to be a risk factor for subclinical infection.

Richa Sareen, consultant, pulmonology and critical care medicine at Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj in New Delhi, though concurred with other doctors on the immunity not lasting longer post infection, but asked to take the “statistical findings with a pinch of salt”.

“The survey done in August and one in September were not done on same set of people, so one should not immediately extrapolate the findings,” she said.

Ms. Sareen and Dr. Sherwal suggested holding sero-prevalance surveys with a wider interval than every month.

“In fact, it should be done every three months to get a better idea for analysis,” she said.

The next round of survey was scheduled to start from October 1 but it will be delayed a bit, officials had earlier said.

The surveyors have recommended that there is a need to space the sero survey rounds and future surveillance should focus more on “ensuring representativeness of the sample in terms of settlement type and socio-economic status”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jbvfut/article32744208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-DELHI-CORONAVIRUS-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-immunity-for-lesser-time-change-in-virulence-of-virus-say-experts-on-september-sero-survey-results/article32744209.ece
56,2020/10/01,Railways may run 200 more trains for festival season,"Railways has been gradually restarting passenger services and is currently running about 310 passenger trains across the country.

Railway Board Chairman and CEO V.K. Yadav on Thursday said the Railways plans to introduce about 200 more special passenger trains between October 15 and November 30 to cater to the festive season demand.

“We have conducted meetings with the general managers of zones and instructed them to speak with local administration and review the COVID-19 situation. They have been asked to give us a report after which we will decide how many trains can be introduced during the holiday season,” Mr. Yadav said, adding that as of now, the estimate is that Railways may run around 200 trains, but this number could go up.

While the operation of normal time-tabled trains remain suspended since March 22, the Railways has been gradually restarting passenger services and is currently running about 310 passenger trains across the country.

“As far as passenger trains are concerned, the situation now is that we will analyse the requirements of trains, the traffic patterns and corona status on a daily basis. Wherever there is a need, we will run trains,” he said.

Freight revenues up

The Railways on Thursday said its revenue from freight operations in September grew 13.54% over the year-ago month in spite of the COVID-19 related challenges, terming it a “remarkable turnaround”.

“In September 2020, Indian Railways earned ₹9,896.86 crore from freight loading, which is ₹1,180.57 crore higher than last year’s earnings for the same period (₹8,716.29 crore). The increase in freight revenue is 13.54%,” the Railways said in a statement.

Noting that trends in freight traffic reflect the broad trends of turnaround in economic activities as well, the Railways added that last month, freight loading stood at 102.12 million tonnes, 15.35% higher than 88.53 million tonnes in September 2019.

The freight basket for last month included 42.89 million tonnes of coal, 13.53 million tonnes of iron ore, 6.3 million tonnes of foodgrains, 5.34 million tonnes of fertilizers, 6.05 million tonnes of cement (excluding clinker), 3.85 million tonnes of clinker, and 3.52 million tonnes of mineral oil.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iqzi74/article30683592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAILKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/railways-to-introduce-200-more-trains-during-festive-season-says-board-chairman/article32743648.ece

India and Myanmar on Thursday carried out a comprehensive review of their multi-faceted relationship that is underpinned by deepening cooperation in areas of trade and investment, power, energy and healthcare.

At a virtual meeting of India-Myanmar foreign office consultations, the two sides also held extensive discussions on ways to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.

The Indian delegation at the meeting was led by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla while the Myanmarese team was headed by Permanent Secretary U Soe Han.

Myanmar is one of India’s strategic neighbours and shares a 1,640-km-long border with a number of northeastern states including militancy-hit Nagaland and Manipur.

In the talks, the MEA said the foreign secretary reiterated the priority India attaches to its partnership with Myanmar in accordance with its ‘Neighborhood First’ and ‘Act East’ policies.

“He stated that India remained committed to enhancing its multifaceted cooperation with Myanmar and also to explore new avenues of cooperation,” it said in a statement.

The MEA said both sides reviewed the entire expanse of ties including cooperation in regional and multilateral fora.

“Both sides reviewed the entire gamut of relations, including border cooperation and upgradation of border infrastructure, status of India’s ongoing development projects in Myanmar, trade and investment ties, power and energy cooperation, consular matters and cultural cooperation,” the MEA added.

The cooperation in cultural spheres included the ongoing restoration work on pagodas in Bagan which were damaged by earthquake.

It was noted that the next joint trade committee ministerial meeting, to be held on October 20, will be useful in further strengthening bilateral trade and investment relations, the MEA said.

“Both sides also held extensive discussions on the challenges posed by COVID-19 and ways to mitigate its impact, including through vaccine development, supply of medicines, equipment and technology and capacity building,” it said.

The MEA said Permanent Secretary Han reaffirmed Myanmar’s commitment to further strengthen its time tested partnership with India for the mutual benefit of the two countries.

He also expressed appreciation for the COVID-19 related development assistance extended by India to Myanmar.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the government was open to talks with farmer groups to allay any apprehensions about the three farm-related Acts passed in the monsoon session. Parliament had passed The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation), Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, in the last session prompting protests from the Opposition and farmer groups and with NDA ally Shiromani Akali Dal walking out of the alliance.

59,2020/10/01,"Most fakes are ₹2,000 notes: NCRB","Four years after demonetisation, data on seizures of counterfeit notes shows there is a surge in seizure of fake currency in 2019 compared to 2018

Four years after demonetisation, the highest number of all counterfeit notes seized last year was in the denomination of ₹2,000, according to the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) annual Crime in India report.

The data on seizures of counterfeit notes from all the States and Union Territories also shows there is a surge in seizure of fake Indian currency notes in 2019 compared to 2018.

According to the NCRB, ₹25.39 crore in Fake Indian Currency Notes were seized in 2019, compared to ₹ 17.95 crore 2018, showing an increase of 11.7%.

Data: How much currency was in circulation in FY2019?

On November 8, 2016, when the government announced the scrapping of old ₹ 500 and ₹1000 notes, one of the reasons attributed was wiping out fake currency notes in circulation.

Govt claim

The government claimed that the ₹ 2,000 notes had several high security features.

According to the NCRB, 90,566 pieces of fake ₹ 2,000 notes were seized in 2019. The highest number of seizures were from Karnataka- 23,599, Gujarat- 14,494 and West Bengal- 13,637 pieces.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Annual Report for 2019-20, released on August 25, said the RBI presses did not print even a single ₹2,000 note last fiscal. There had been a gradual decline in pieces of ₹2,000 notes in circulation, from 3.6 billion pieces in 2017-18 to 2.73 billion pieces in 2019-20.

In 2019, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) registered 14 cases, where 13,459 pieces of ₹2,000 counterfeit notes had been seized. It also registered eight cases to probe recovery of fake ₹500 notes. A specialised unit to investigate fake currency notes was established in the NIA few years ago.

Though there was no definite account of the number of fake notes in circulation with the government when demonetisation was announced, a study done by the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in 2015 said that at any given point of time ₹ 400 crore worth fake currency notes were in circulation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/zggypz/article32743044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RS2000CURRENCYNOTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/most-fakes-are-2000-notes-ncrb/article32743045.ece
60,2020/10/01,Stubble burning: Centre to test decomposer technology,"Javadekar convenes a meeting of CMs and officials from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, U.P. and Rajasthan

The Union government will this year test a straw-decomposing technology developed by scientists at the the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, to deter farmers from burning paddy stubble, Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar said after convening a meeting of Chief Ministers and State government officials from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.

‘PUSA Decomposer’

The ‘PUSA Decomposer’, as it is called, is a set of four tablets made by extracting fungi strains that help the paddy straw to decompose at a much faster rate than usual, giving farmers the option to shred the straw, spray a solution containing the fungal strains, and mix it with the soil for decomposition.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal too had discussed this technology.

At a media briefing after the virtual summit, Mr. Javadekar said, “This year we will test it in all States, in thousands of hectares, and based on the results we will expand it next year”.

In winter

With the advent of winter, contribution from stubble burning to pollution can on the worst days climb to as much as 40% with the rest from construction debris, plastic burning and road dust. Adverse meteorological conditions play a significant role in worsening the impact of stubble burning, which coincides with the time farmers must clear their field of paddy straw for sowing the winter wheat.

“We have given machines worth ₹1,700 crore to farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Teams of the Central Pollution Control Board will be closely monitoring instances of violation,” said Mr. Javadekar.

The meeting was attended by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), State boards, the DDA and the NDMC. Six meetings had been held to discuss the issue and the Centre has taken several measures for the same.

After chairing the over one-hour-long meeting , Mr. Javadekar said all the five States gave details of their action plans and Delhi had been asked to focus on its 13 pollution hotspots and any incomplete road work must be completed to avoid dust.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nl9y3j/article32742963.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STUBBLEBURNING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/stubble-burning-centre-to-test-decomposer-technology/article32742964.ece
61,2020/10/01,Nutrition Month comes to a close without any mention of COVID-19 and its impact on malnutrition,"Government data showed that services geared towards maternal and child health were impeded due to lockdowns

The Nutrition Month or Poshan Maah observed every September since the past three years as part of the the government’s efforts to ensure community mobilisation to curb malnutrition under the National Nutrition Mission came to a close earlier this week without any mention of COVID-19 and its impact on hunger and rising levels of malnutrition and policy measures being taken to address them.

The Ministry of Women and Child Development held a one-hour long closing ceremony on Wednesday which was broadcast on YouTube. A Joint Secretary-level official in-charge of the Nutrition Mission at the Centre described various activities undertaken by different stakeholders in the past one month, including “social media campaigns” and “meme competitions”, but made no mention of the challenges imposed by the pandemic in delivery of services or the urgent need to track and identify pregnant women, lactating mothers and children under the age of six years most vulnerable to the economic impact of COVID-19 or due to the failure in service delivery because of lockdowns.

According to a study brought out by the Standing Together for Nutrition consortium, and published in The Lancet in July, an additional 6.7 million children under the age of five could be severely wasted as the pandemic resulted in disruption of food systems and impeded access to healthcare services. This sparked world bodies such as UNICEF, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to appeal to the governments around the world for an immediate response against malnutrition.

The government data on the Health Management Information System (HMIS) showed that services geared towards maternal and child health were impeded due to the lockdowns between April and July.

However, these concerns found no mention at Wednesday’s ceremony. In her concluding remarks, Minister of State for Women and Child Development Debasree Chaudhuri spoke about identification of Severe Acute Malnourished (SAM) children and setting up of nutrition gardens as the two broad focus areas of the Poshan Maah. The only policy decision announced by the Ministry in the past month was a Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Ministry of AYUSH in integrating principles of ayurveda and yoga with various services delivered at anganwadis. An important policy announcement on guidelines for supplementary nutrition distributed at anganwadis and management of SAM children remains pending for more than three years.

“The policy response from India’s perspective definitely needs to be strengthened multifold. If we unpack the multiple forms of malnutrition, we already know India’s undernutrition burden is still unacceptably high and the COVID-19 is expected to exacerbate it. We need disaster management integrated in social protection schemes, especially those pertaining to nutrition. We need procedures and protocols for feeding, providing rations and continuing with other important healthcare features like immunisation, management of severe acute malnutrition children, functional nutritional rehabilitation centres, operational “Poshan” centres where pregnant women and young children can be provided care and nourishment under proper supervision and precautions. Of course, efforts were being made but they were far and few between”, says Shweta Khandelwal, Head Nutrition Research and Additional Professor at Public Health Foundation of India.

“The Poshan Maah is an important and visible reminder of the nutrition mission and its goals, and several visible discussions were held. This was an important time to reflect on how nutrition could be better protected in the context of COVID-19 and the economic slowdown and what more would be needed. Second, on SAM itself, we know that community-wide efforts focused on prevention are more effective on changing population levels of wasting than a focus on curing individual malnourished children, even though individual children obviously need the attention. Making the preventive aspects of Poshan Abhiyaan work very well and delivering the take home rations, counselling, growth monitoring and other services in the first 1000 days to everyone can go a long way in addressing both stunting and wasting. Some of these need no new policy prescriptions — but they need a continued and sustained emphasis on doing the right things for every woman and every child, all 27 million of those born every year,” explained Purnima Menon, Senior Research Fellow at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).

While the Centre may have failed to show urgency, some States responded with alacrity.

“Several States have issued policies and guidelines related to nutrition, including on addressing SAM — e.g. Assam, MP, UP. Actually, I have been very impressed how these issues were taken on at State level in such a short time. Very few States had policies, guidelines, statements around these before and many do have them now. We expect that these will have a long-lasting and large impact beyond Poshan Maah. Not until the recent past did SAM receive so much attention. Also, it is great to see that most States did respond and recognise that prevention of SAM, identifying children with SAM and providing management and care for these children are as important. Of course, the future will tell us [the results], but I think this was a very successful Poshan Maah.

“Conducting a running event like this during the times of COVID-19 is to underline the fact that we need to boost our immunity and enhance physical capability to combat diseases like the coronavirus while following medical protocols such as wearing face masks and ensuring physical distancing,” the CRPF director general told reporters at the closing event of the “Fit India Freedom Run” at Vijay Chowk in the national capital.

CRPF spokesperson Deputy Inspector General Moses Dhinakaran said the force personnel deployed across the country have collectively walked and run about 1.5 crore kms as part of the fitness initiative that was launched on August 15.

Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officials, sportspersons including the first Arjuna award recipient of the country G.S. Randhawa, Olympian Sushil Kumar, weightlifter Kunjarani Devi and others took part in a run from Vijay Chowk to India Gate in central Delhi to mark the occasion.

64,2020/10/01,First plane for the exclusive use of VVIPs lands in Delhi,"Two IAF pilots have been trained by Air India to operate the Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft, and several others are undergoing training

The country’s first-ever VVIP plane, a Boeing 777-300 ER, landed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport Thursday afternoon, after undergoing retrofitment in the U.S. for more than two years. The aircraft’s delivery was delayed by three months due to lockdown-related restrictions in the United States.

A small welcome ceremony was conducted at the airport, where Air India Chairman and Managing Director Rajiv Bansal, senior officials from the airline and representatives from the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and the Indian Air Force were present. A tilak was put on the body of the aircraft and sweets were distributed among the officials present, following which they were given a tour inside the aircraft. Air India’s Captain Himanshu Tiwari was the commander of the plane and flew it from the U.S. to India.

“The aircraft is now parked at the IAF’s (Indian Air Force) technical area at the airport and ready to be flown for VVIP use,” an official in the know told The Hindu on the condition of anonymity.

The aircraft is one of the two Boeing 777-300 ERs, which joined Air India’s fleet in 2018 and were sent to the Dallas Forth Worth in Texas, Boeing’s headquarters, for retrofitment worthy of India’s VVIPs, including the President, the Vice-President and the Prime Minister. The second aircraft is likely to return to India by the end of October.

Until now, the government borrowed Boeing 747s from Air India whenever there was a VVIP visit scheduled. Apart from being set aside for exclusive use by VVIPs, the planes also offer the capability of flying long haul distances without the need to make a stop for refuelling midway because of the longer range offered by 777-300 ERs as compared to the 747s.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation is in the process of moving a Cabinet note on the transfer of the ownership of the two planes from Air India to the Indian Air Force as the national carrier is likely to be sold to a private player, a government official confirmed.

The government has paid Air India ₹4,632 crore towards the cost of these planes. Air India will de-register these aircraft and hand them over to the Indian Air Force. The planes will then be entered into the IAF’s registry and get a K-series registration number given to military aircraft.

Two IAF pilots have been trained by Air India to operate the aircraft, and several others are undergoing training. They will be assisted by a pool of pilots from Air India.

The aircraft, among other things, includes a VVIP suite, two conference rooms, a press briefing room, a patient transfer unit, secure video telephony and sound proofing. It’s also equipped with missile warning sensors and countermeasures dispensing defence system, which are a part of the large aircraft infrared countermeasures (LAIRCM) self-protection suites (SPS) provided by the U.S. government for $190 million.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e53v44/article32744567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Boeing777-vvip-plane,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/boeing-777-plane-for-vvip-travel-arrives-in-india/article32741825.ece

Over 4,300 urban local bodies have so far been declared open defecation-free in the country under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban, the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry said on Thursday.

The ministry said it has been made possible through construction of more than 66 lakh individual household toilets and over 6 lakh community and public toilets, far exceeding the Mission’s targets.

“Since its launch in 2014, Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) has made significant progress in the area of both sanitation and solid waste management. A total of 4,327 urban local bodies have been declared open defecation-free (ODF) so far,” the ministry said in a statement.

Congress leaders on Thursday quoted United States President Donald Trump’s comments made during the presidential debate with Joe Biden to target the Narendra Modi government on its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The President of the United States has made a serious charge that India is concealing COVID-19 deaths. We wish to remind him that Gujarat is still paying a price for hosting him in the midst of a pandemic. We hope our Government answers to his allegations”, tweeted senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel.

67,2020/10/01,State can’t term economic decline due to pandemic a ‘public emergency’: Supreme Court,"It quashes Gujarat notification exempting factories from paying overtime wages to workers during lockdown between April 20 and July 19

The State cannot declare the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic a “public emergency”to curtail the rights of people, the Supreme Court said on Thursday.

The pandemic had not resulted in an ‘internal disturbance’ of a nature that posed a ‘grave emergency’ whereby the security of India was threatened, it said.

A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud observed that the sweeping powers of the State to declare a public emergency could only be wielded in case of “threat to the security of India or a part of the territory must be caused by war, external aggression or an internal disturbance”.

In a 41-page judgment, Justice Chandrachud observed: “We find that the economic slowdown created by the COVID-19 pandemic does not qualify as an internal disturbance threatening the security of the State...Unless the threshold of an economic hardship is so extreme that it leads to disruption of public order and threatens the security of India or of a part of its territory, recourse cannot be taken to such emergency powers which are to be used sparingly under the law”.

Gujarat notifications

The verdict dealt with blanket notifications issued by the Gujarat government denying factory workers overtime wages during the lockdown period from April to July. It did this by invoking its powers of declaring a public emergency under Section 5 of the Factories Act. The trade unions appealed to the Supreme Court for relief.

Justice Chandrachud wrote it was “ironical” that a welfare State was exploiting workers when their bargaining powers were at the feeblest. Instead of protecting workers at a time of migrant exodus and panic, it was making their condition even more onerous.

“The State cannot permit workers to be exploited in a manner that renders the hard-won protections of the Factories Act, 1948 illusory and the constitutional promise of social and economic democracy into paper-tigers”, the order said.

The apex court agreed that the pandemic had put a great strain on the economy. But the Centre had taken steps under the Disaster Management Act. The Centre and the States have to work together to resolve issues. But the economic hardship had not affected the security of India. Neither had its peace or integrity been disturbed to declare a public emergency, it said.

Emergency powers’ use

The emergency powers under Article 352 of the Constitution had been only used thrice before. During the Chinese aggression in 1962, when hostilities broke out with Pakistan in 1971 and in 1975 when the Indira Gandhi government declared that a “grave emergency exists whereby the security of India is threatened by ‘internal disturbance’.”

The court said the post Emergency days saw the enactment of the 44th Amendment to the Constitution, which mandated that “internal disturbance” should reach the stage of “armed rebellion” threatening national security in order to declare a state of public emergency.

The sharp economic decline posed no such threat, the court concluded. It used its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to direct the payment of overtime wages to all eligible factory workers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on6a3g/article32741102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUSCOVID19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pandemic-cant-be-an-excuse-to-deny-workers-dignity-of-their-labour-supreme-court/article32741103.ece
68,2020/10/01,Supreme Court gives bail to terror accused charged under UAPA,"Apex court disagrees with Rajasthan High Court’s refusal to grant bail to him.

The Supreme Court has granted bail to a person accused under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) who has spent over six years in jail.

A Bench led by Justice Rohinton Nariman, in an order on Wednesday, disagreed with the Rajasthan High Court’s refusal to grant bail to the accused.

In a short order, the Bench said the High Court’s view that a prima facie case had been made out against the accused solely based on the statement given by the public prosecutor was not “strictly correct”.

Accused Aadil Ansari is booked under Section 43D(5) of the UAPA for allegedly indulging in terror activities. It is practically impossible to get bail under this provision. It allows a court to reject bail even if police documents or the prosecutor suggests the allegations are “prima facie true”.

But the court found that Ansari's name is not mentioned in the FIR. It said it had also gone through the charge sheet filed in September 2014. It also noted that Ansari was denied bail in October 2014.

“We are satisfied that the High Court judgment stating that a prima facie case has been made out against the petitioner based on the public prosecutor’s statement cannot be said to be strictly correct”, the Supreme Court concluded.

It ordered Ansari’s release on bail without making any remarks about the case. The court said it did not want to prejudice the trial.

“Having perused these documents, without saying anything more, so as not to prejudice the trial, we set aside the judgment of the High Court and enlarge the petitioner on bail, subject to the usual conditions to be imposed by the trial court”, the order read.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u8efqs/article32508873.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3TH-SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-gives-bail-to-terror-accused-charged-under-uapa/article32741012.ece
69,2020/10/01,"3 soldiers killed, 5 injured in Pakistan firing along LoC","Befitting response is being given, says Army.

Three soldiers were killed and five others were injured as the Pakistan Army resorted to “unprovoked ceasefire violations” along the Line of Control (LoC) in J&K’s Kupwara and Poonch districts in the past 24 hours.

A Srinagar-based Defence spokesperson said the Pakistan Army initiated an unprovoked ceasefire violation along the LoC in Naugam Sector, Kupwara, on Thursday morning.

“The Pakistan Army resorted to firing mortars and other weapons. Two soldiers sustained fatal injuries,” the spokesperson said.

He said four injured soldiers had been evacuated to a hospital and were being treated.

“A befitting response is being given,” the Army said.

On Thursday afternoon, ceasefire violations by Pakistan spread to other parts of north Kashmir.

“Pakistan also initiated an unprovoked ceasefire violation along the LoC in Keran and Machil sectors, Kupwara, in the afternoon. Pakistan fired from artillery guns, mortars and other weapons,” the Army spokesperson said.

In a separate incident that took place in the Pir Panjal Valley’s Poonch district on Wednesday night, the Pakistan Army resorted to “firing and shelling”, which left one soldier dead and another injured.

An official said Pakistan opened fire “both from small arms as well as mortars” on Wednesday night in the Krishna Ghati Sector in Poonch.

Officials identified the deceased soldier as sepoy Karnail Singh. Another soldier, rifleman Virender Singh, was shifted to a hospital and is being treated.

The latest ceasefire violations have come as a major escalation between the two countries in J&K, after months of frequent but minor incidents of ceasefire violations.

Advocate Prashant Bhushan has filed a review petition in the Supreme Court against its decision to fine him a nominal Re. 1 as punishment for committing criminal contempt by ‘scandalising the court’ with his tweet on a picture of the Chief Justice of India on a heavy bike and another about the role of the court in the past six years.

Mr. Bhushan urged the court to recall the punishment. He said the tweets were criticism. He argued that dissent and criticism of an institution did not amount to criminal contempt.

The Hindu Explains | What is contempt of court?

The senior lawyer asked the court to look into whether its power to initiate suo motu contempt was subject to the fundamental rights of a person. Dissent and free, fearless exchange of ideas were the central pillars of democracy.

The petition said it was a manifest error on the part of the judgment on August 30 to conclude that criticism of individual judges amounted to a malicious attack on the court itself.

Bar Council notice

Separately responding to a notice from the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) on why he should not be disbarred, Mr. Bhushan urged the lawyers’ body to stand up for truth and freedom of speech, to stand in solidarity.

“The Supreme Court judgments holding me guilty and sentencing me for criminal contempt are a fundamental assault on the freedom of speech and independence of the Bar”, he wrote back.

The Bar Councils should not take cognisance of the Supreme Court verdict, which has “severely constricted and abridged the freedom, rights and dignity of the members of the Bar and also ordinary citizens.

One of the 351 prosecution witnesses in the Babri Masjid demolition case, Haji Mehboob, is distraught after a special CBI court acquitted senior BJP leader L.K. Advani and 31 others of all charges, including criminal conspiracy.

“What justice? There is no meaning in justice in this country,” said Mr. Mehboob, who was also one of the litigants in the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi title suit that was decided by the Supreme Court last year.

74,2020/10/01,Supreme Court okays scheme proposed by govt. on refund of air tickets booked during lockdown,"Proposal equitably balances interests of passengers and air sector, says top court

The Supreme Court on Thursday endorsed a refund and credit shell policy scheme proposed by the government to reimburse passengers whose flights were cancelled during the coronavirus lockdown.

A three-judge Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R. Subhash Reddy and M.R. Shah agreed with the government’s view that the scheme equitably balanced the interests of the passengers and the financially distressed air sector.

Also read: Is proposal to refund air tickets confined to bookings made during lockdown, asks Supreme Court

“The pandemic situation has adversely affected the economy globally, in several sectors. Our country — India — and the civil aviation sector is not an exception... Such formulations [refund and credit shell policy] are workable solutions in these peculiar circumstances which are prevailing in the country,” Justice Reddy, who authored the judgment, said.

The court ordered the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to ensure that airlines strictly comply with the judgment.

In a series of directions in tune with the government’s scheme, the court directed that airlines will have to give full and immediate refund — within three weeks from the date of cancellation — to passengers who had booked their flight tickets during lockdown for travel anytime between March 25 to May 24 (the period of lockdown). This is applicable to both domestic flights and international ones out of India on either Indian or foreign carriers.

In case the tickets were booked during the lockdown through travel agents for flights scrapped in the course of the lockdown, the airlines will pay the refunds to the travel agent, who will immediately transfer them to the passengers.

The court said the Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs) will, as usual, govern passengers who have booked tickets at any point of time for travel on dates beyond May 24.

In “all other cases” — which include tickets booked prior to the lockdown for travel during the freeze — the airlines will get 15 days from October 1 to refund the passengers.

But the court agreed with the government that the flight ban had dented the air sector. Air traffic has dropped heavily. So, any strict enforcement of CARs would not yield meaningful results.

Hence, the court has acknowledged the government’s alternative scheme for airlines to open credit shells in the names of passengers. The court found that this was a necessary step to balance the interests of the passengers and the airline sector.

According to this scheme, a credit shell will be opened in the name of the passenger who booked the ticket. This shell is valid up to March 31, 2021. In case the passenger chooses not to use the credit shell, the airline will have to refund the ticket money by the end of March 2021.

The credit shell is transferable to any person of the passenger’s choice.

As an incentive mechanism, the proposal offered .5% increase in the valuation of the credit shell if it was not “consumed” till June 30, 2020. The value of the credit shell would increase .75% if the credit remains untouched till March 31, 2021.

Passengers can travel any route of their choice on the credit shell. If the fare is above the credit shell limit, it can be topped up. If it is less, the balance would be paid back to the passenger.

The judgment came on a petition filed by NGO, Pravasi Legal Cell, represented by senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Jose Abraham, highlighting the plight of the passengers whose flights were cancelled during the lockdown.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8hd4ct/article32226084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WESTBENGAL2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-okays-scheme-proposed-by-govt-on-refund-of-air-tickets-booked-during-lockdown/article32739980.ece
75,2020/10/01,OFB dismisses reports on accidents due to poor quality ammunition,"Rethink corporatisation of Ordnance Factory Board, says Shiv Sena MP

In a letter to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi appealed for a rethink of the government’s decision on the corporatisation of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), while the OFB dismissed reports of several accidents between 2014 and 2019 due to poor quality ammunition manufactured by them and said it “does not accept the figures”.

“For the accidents between January 2015 to December 2019, where defect investigation has been completed, only 19% of the cases are attributable to OFB,” an OFB spokesperson said. Further, out of the total number of accidents where defect investigation has been completed, only 2% of the cases where casualties have been reported are attributable to the OFB, he stated.

As reported earlier, according to the Army’s internal data, between 2014 and 2019 there were 403 incidents due to poor quality of ammunition manufactured by the OFB, due to which the Army suffered 25 deaths and 146 injuries and also disposed of ₹960 crore worth of ammunition before the shelf life was complete.

The decision of the government to corporatise the ordnance factories goes against the assurances given by the previous four Defence Ministers to the federations, Ms. Chaturvedi claimed. “It also goes against the statement of the government before the Parliamentary Standing Committee, which stated that, converting OFB into corporate entities is not a viable proposal, due to fluctuation of the requirement of the armed forces and also the ordnance factories have to maintain spare capacity as a war reserve,” Ms. Chaturvedi said in the letter. She added that she had received a representation from several workers’ federations that 99% of ordnance factory employees had rejected the government’s move to corporatise them.

Between 2011 and 2018, there have been more than 125 accidents involving ammunition procured from sources other than the OFB, both domestic and foreign, the OFB spokesperson said, stating that only cases where OFB ammunition was involved were being selectively reported.

“It must be emphasised here that most of these accidents involve vintage ammunition manufactured prior to 2006, when inspection of all input materials was undertaken by the Director General Quality Assurance (DGQA) and OFB had no control over the quality of input material,” the spokesperson said. In fact, after 2005-06, when the responsibility for inspection of input material was given to the OFB, there had been a decrease in the number of accidents, he said.

Since 2013, a system of advanced early user exploitation based on a random sample drawn from each freshly manufactured lot of ammunition was in place, in addition to the established schedule of inspection and validation conducted by the DGQA, the spokesperson said. “The quality of ammunition manufactured by the OFB is also amply testified to by the receipt of repeat export orders of ammunition supplied under self-certification,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/s2qwk7/article32746044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ammunition-ofb-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ordnance-factory-board-dismisses-armys-reports-attributing-accidents-to-poor-quality-ammunition/article32739741.ece

77,2020/10/01,DMK MP Tiruchi Siva moves Supreme Court against passage of agriculture laws,"They are prima facie unconstitutional, illegal and arbitrary, says Tiruchi Siva.

DMK MP Tiruchi Siva on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court against the passage of the controversial agriculture laws.

Mr. Siva, in the petition settled by senior advocate P. Wilson and filed by advocate D. Kumanan, has challenged the constitutionality of the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act and The Essential Commodities (Amendment )Act 2020 (Act 21 of 2020) on various grounds.

The DMK leader said the laws were “prima facie unconstitutional, illegal and arbitrary” as they would “usher in a new exploitative regime for the poor farmers of the country, who are entirely dependent on earning their livelihood, by selling their produce in the market”.

The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act would facilitate black marketing. It will have black market dealers regulate the stock limit and stocking of agricultural produce.

“Suffice it to say that the Acts attack the very foundation of the agricultural fabric of the country that was built to safeguard the interests of the farmers and not leave them at the mercy of the new era of privatisation,” the petition said.

It said the Acts will create an alternative that’s outside the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC).",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/m8dd5f/article30959879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DMK-fields-TiruGR976HJQ14jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dmk-mp-moves-sc-against-passage-of-agriculture-laws/article32736930.ece

79,2020/10/01,NHRC issues notice to MHA over Amnesty’s allegations,"An explanation has ben sought from the Home Ministry.

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Wednesday took suo motu cognisance of Amnesty International shutting its India operations due to an alleged “witch-hunt” of rights’ organisations by the government and ordered that a notice be issued to the Union Home Secretary.

The comments of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) about the allegations levelled by Amnesty were sought within six weeks, a statement said. Amnesty had said in a statement on Tuesday that it had stopped all its operations after its bank accounts were frozen.

“It is alleged that this is the latest in the incessant witch-hunt of human rights organisations by the government of India over unfounded and motivated allegations,” the statement said.

The MHA had responded by saying that Amnesty’s stand was “unfortunate” and “exaggerated”.

“The organisation has been accused of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) violations, and ‘interference in domestic police debates’ despite being funded by foreign donations. The rights group has reportedly denied the financial violations charges and has stated that they have been in full compliance with all laws,” the NHRC stated.

Amnesty also said that the harassment by the government was due to its calls for transparency and accountability with regard to the Delhi police in the case of the February riots, and with regard to the government in case of Jammu and Kashmir.

“Amnesty International is a reputed non-governmental organisation raising its voice globally whenever there is an incident of violation of human rights of the people. The allegations levelled by the organisation are serious in nature and have been strongly answered by the government agency. Any kind of difference of opinion may be a subject of investigation and decision by the competent court. The Commission finds it necessary to go through the matter, analyse the facts and reach a conclusion in the interest of human rights friendly environment in the country,” the NHRC said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fs36o1/article31971157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THNHRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nhrc-issues-notice-to-mha-over-amnestys-allegations/article32736503.ece

81,2020/10/01,APSCHE move to groom entrepreneurs,"It asks universities and professional institutions to set up EISCs

The Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE) has asked universities and professional and autonomous colleges to establish Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Start-Ups Centres (EISCs) to promote the culture of entrepreneurship in the State.

“The aim is to ignite creative thinking and nurture entrepreneurial talent in students,” said council Vice-Chairman K. Ramamohan Rao.

“By the end of this year, there will be more than 500 such centres in educational institutions,” he said.

“We want to encourage young graduates to become ‘job generators’ rather than ‘job seekers’, and create an innovation ecosystem,” said Mr. Rao.

The role of these centres will entail organising awareness campaign with focus on promotion of entrepreneurial attitude among youth.

Their other activities are to identify potential candidates and initiate programmes to groom them, give the candidates business ideas and convert them into viable business/incubation plans and create new technology ventures, facilitate preparation of feasibility report and Detailed Project Reports (DPR) as per the requirement of the funding agencies, mentoring, networking, providing connectivity with resources and facilitating early stage seed funding.

To motivate the students, the centres will conduct workshops, competitions and interactive sessions with eminent personalities and organise other annual events.

The EISC will be guided by an advisory committee consisting of representatives from faculty, industry, business houses, District Industry Centres, banks, successful local entrepreneurs and local government. The committee will work under the chairmanship of the Vice-Chancellor in a university and the principal in a college. Each centre will have a director as an overall in-charge, who can be one of the senior professors from the institution or an experienced person from outside the institution, appointed on contract basis.

These centres will identify resource persons from different sectors such as manufacturing, service and social sector, or specific business domain and constitute suitable panels, each of which will be represented by persons from the Department of Industries, banking, teaching (preferably commerce and management) and an expert from related business domain.

State-level committee

A State-level advisory and monitoring committee will be constituted with the Chairman, APSCHE, at its helm, and the members will be from State universities, colleges, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of MSME and Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC).

“The committee will periodically review the activities and progress of the centres, which will be required to submit an annual report in a prescribed format duly approved by the Executive Council of the respective university in March every year,” explained Mr. Rao.

The panel may visit some centres physically or interact with the beneficiaries in the online mode and will submit a consolidated annual report to the APSCHE and to the government.

“Exploring the possibilities of connecting the industry, business, State and Central government’s support programmes and research organisations with these centres, the committee will promote an entrepreneurial ecosystem in the State,” said Mr. Rao.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/apsche-move-to-groom-entrepreneurs/article32747808.ece
82,2020/10/01,Senior A.P. cadre IFS officer ‘jumps’ to death in Hyderabad,"A senior Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer allotted to the Andhra Pradesh cadre, V. Bhaskara Ramana Murthy (59), allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the ninth floor of his apartment complex at Nagole here in the early hours of Thursday.

The 1987 batch officer was working as Principal Chief Conservator of Forests for Coastal Zone Management at Aranya Bhavan in Guntur. Dr. Murthy is survived by his wife Jyothi and two daughters – Mohata and Manvitha.

He had been on leave for personal reasons since the third week of July, and had since been residing at the apartment complex at Rajiv Swagruha Sadbhavana Township in L.B. Nagar, said inspector V. Ashok Reddy.

“After dinner, he went to bed at around 9.30 p.m. on Wednesday. At around 1.30 a.m. on Thursday, the security guard at the complex, Appa Rao, heard a thud near the ‘A’ block. On rushing there, he found Dr. Murthy lying in a pool of blood,” Mr. Ashok Reddy said.

“The reason for his extreme step is not known. A case under Section 174 of the CrPC (suspicious death) has been registered. The body has been handed over to the family members after autopsy,” he added.

‘No family, financial issues’

“There are no family or financial issues. I don’t know about issues at work,” said Ms. Jyothi’s brother Prabhakar, who works in the LIC of India.

“Dr. Murthy performed the ‘muhurtham pooja’ for Manvitha’s wedding on Wednesday. Later in the evening, he, along with his wife and daughter, went to the Sai Baba temple at Dilsukhnagar. He was making arrangements for the wedding,” Mr. Prabhakar said. Dr. Murthy’s elder daughter Mohata, who got married a few years ago, lives in Bengaluru, he added.

Dr. Murthy’s colleagues from the Telangana cadre, who were at his residence to console the family members, were in a state of shock.

“Though we were not in regular touch since the State’s bifurcation, Dr. Murthy called me a couple of times for official work. He was a jovial person and never hurt anyone,” a senior IFS officer said. “He was a man of principles and a thorough professional,” said another officer.

BJP State president Somu Veerraju has ridiculed CPI national secretary K. Narayana for finding fault with the CBI court verdict in the Babri Masjid demolition case.

In a press release, Mr. Veerraju said that Mr. Narayana’s allegation that L.K. Advani and other top BJP leaders were behind the incident was ridiculous as the court said in no uncertain terms that there was no evidence of such a conspiracy.

“The Communist parties, which have been anti-Hindu right from the beginning and have always been appeasing other parties for electoral gains, are not expected to accept the verdict,” Mr. Veerraju said, and questioned whether Mr. Narayana had witnessed the BJP leaders provoking the ‘kar sevaks’ to bring down the mosque.

BJP-JSP alliance

He further said that the CPI leader had no right to criticise the BJP-JSP alliance, pointing out that there was perhaps no party in the country with which the Left parties had not tied up.

The CPI had forged alliances with the Congress, the TDP, and even the Jana Sangh in the past, he said. “Mr. Narayana is targeting JSP chief Pawan Kalyan, with whom the CPI had joined hands earlier,” Mr. Veerraju said, and demanded that the CPI leader stop his “vicious propaganda” against the BJP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5uxucg/article32652154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20-VJ-SOMU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/somu-lashes-out-at-narayana-for-faulting-babri-verdict/article32747749.ece

An 11-foot-long Indian rock python was stoned to death by a group of farmers and shepherds at Kotrepalle village in Baireddipalle mandal, 70 km from the district headquarters, on Thursday.

According to information, a farmer while working in his field heard the hissing sounds from the bushes nearby. He found the python stalking a herd of goats. Soon, some shepherds and farmers gathered at the spot. They reportedly stoned the python to death.

Some villagers said that the python had been slithering into the fields frequently.

Responding to the incident, a senior forest official said they would inquire about the incident. “Even as reptiles such as Indian rock pythons and king cobras are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, the laws usually apply to cases involving smuggling activities. It is difficult to establish the circumstances under which these reptiles get killed by people. Many such cases go unnoticed,” he said.

The forests spreading from Bangarupalem to V. Kota covering the Koundinya Wildlife Sanctuary is home to many reptile species, which often slither into the fields nearby.

88,2020/10/01,‘Farm laws will benefit corporate firms only’,"Farmers’ body wants the three Acts revoked

The Prakasam district unit of All India Kisan Sangarsh Coordination Committee staged a demonstration in front of the Prakasam Bhavan here on Thursday, alleging that the three farm Acts were ‘unconstitutional’.

The members of the committee demanded that the Union government revoke the laws with immediate effect.

Participating in the demonstration, AIKSCC district convenor Ch. Ranga Rao said that the three Acts that got the mandate of the President recently had spelt doom for the farming community in the entire country. “The Acts will curry favour with the corporate firms trading in agricultural produce,” said Mr. Ranga Rao.

Leaders of opposition parties such as CPI, CPI(M), CPI (ML) and some lawyers also took part in the demonstration.

Despite the risks associated with coronavirus pandemic, farmers would continue their protests until the Centre revoked these ‘anti-farmer laws’ which would help the corporate firms fleece the farmers, said CPI district secretary M.L. Narayana while participating in the demonstration.

“The provisions entailing farmers to approach the officials in case of any disputes without going to court is against the basic tenets of natural justice,” said lawyer P. Govindaiah. The Bills were passed in the Parliament in ‘unconstitutional manner’, contended CPI(M) district assistant secretary G.V. Konda Reddy.

Hoarding of produce

“Unregulated market will lead to hoarding of farm produce by traders,” said Organisation for Protection of Democratic Rights (OPDR) leader Ch. Sudhakar.

The corporate firms will now dictate prices of farm produce and small and marginal farmers, who constitutes a majority of the community, will lose their bargain power, said CPI(ML) leader D.V.N.

The TTD on Thursday resolved to organise ‘vahana sevas’ around the mada streets during the ensuing Navaratri Brahmotsavams of Lord Venkateswara scheduled to commence from October 16 with restricted number of devotees.

During the ‘Salakatla Brahmotsavams’, which concluded last week, the festivities were strictly confined to inner portals of the hill temple. But this time, the TTD has resolved to allow a limited number of devotees, particularly those with valid darshan tickets, into the galleries to witness the two-time daily procession of the deity on various vahanams.

Timings

The procession of ‘vahana sevas’ will be organised between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. The same timing will be applicable even on the night of Garuda Seva (October 20 ) as only a restricted number of devotees will be allowed into the galleries.

The decision was taken at a high-level review meeting chaired by Additional EO A.V. Dharma Reddy (who also holds full additional charge as the Executive Officer) with the district, police and HoDs of various TTD departments.

Foot operated sanitisers will be extensively set up at all the galleries besides mandatory thermal screening.

Police and Srivari seva volunteers will be deployed in a limited number and the same stipulation followed in permitting bhajan and cultural troops that precede the daily processions.

Required stocks of laddus will be maintained and arrangements made at Nitya Annadanam (free meals) for the benefit of devout.

96,2020/10/01,M.R. College ‘privatisation move’ triggers protests,"Ashok condemns ‘govt. interference’ in MANSAS Trust affairs

A reported proposal of MANSAS Trust to privatise the historic Maharaja College established here in 1879 met with opposition from all sections of society. Several organisations, including the Pattana Powra Sangham, Students Federation of India and the Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad staged protests on the college premises.

Former Union Minister and former chairperson of the trust P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, Telugu Desam MLC Dwarapureddy Jagadish and others condemned the alleged proposal to privatise the aided college which had produced many eminent personalities. Famous writer Gurajada Apparao and others worked as lecturers in the college of repute in South India.

“The State government’s interference in MANSAS Trust is the root cause of all problems. The trust should not privatise aided colleges, including the M.R. College, since it has been the best educational hub in the State. The college has ₹120 crore funds but is prevented from paying salaries to the staff. It is really unfortunate,” he charged.

‘Special bonding’

Mr. Jagadish said that every family had a special bonding with the college and its sanctity should be protected at any cost. “M.R. College is a heritage structure. The State government is using MANSAS Trust for its own political gains. The people of Vizianagaram district will teach a lesson to the government,” said Mr. Jagadish.

Pattana Powra Samkshema Sangham secretary Reddi Sankara Rao said all sections of society would intensify the agitation if the privatisation proposal was not withdrawn by the government.

ABVP State joint secretary R. Ramana and national executive committee member M. Gopala Patrudu said the privatisation proposal would be a big jolt for students from poor and middle-class sections.

SFI district president Ch. Venkatesh and other members raised slogans against the trust chairperson Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju for ‘initiating privatisation proposal’.

Heavy police force was deployed at the college to avoid any untoward incident.

99,2020/10/01,Kotaiah family to apply for GI tag for ‘Kakinada kaja’,"Exploitation of the brand is the reason behind the initiative, says a fifth-generation member of the family

The family of Chittipeddi Kotaiah is all set to apply for Geographical Indications Registry’s (GIR) tag for ‘Kakinada kaja’, a unique sweet of Andhra Pradesh being made and promoted by the family since 1891 in Kakinada town of East Godavari district.

The Kotaiah family claims that it had migrated from Chinna Parimi village in Guntur district in 1891 and was engaged in production of the sugary delicacy since then, using four prime ingredients — maida, besan, ghee and sugar. “Having a glorious tradition of 129 years in the production of the sweet, our family is determined to apply for the GI tag. We are geared up for the application process by documenting the history of our family and association with the trade and promotion of the sweet. In recent years, some people have started production of ‘Kotaiah kaja’ in various cities to exploit the market for it. However, we do not wish to go for legal battle against them,” Chittipeddi Ram Kumar, 38, told The Hindu. Mr. Kumar runs the store set up by the founder in Kakinada. He has taken upon himself the responsibility of taking forward the family’s legacy in the history of the sweet after his father, Ch. Rama Krishna, died in 2009.

The Kotaiah family owns four stores in the State —three in Kakinada and one in Rajamahendravaram — geographically limiting the production and trade only to East Godavari district.

Challenges

“In recent years, our family witnessed a few challenges from various sections of people, who attempted to tap the brand image and demand for it by wooing our chefs for its authenticity. However, they have failed as people from across the State prefer the kaja from our stores,” said Mr. Kumar, the fifth-generation member of the Kotaiah family.

Mr. Kumar cites lack of awareness and flourishing trade as the prime reasons for which his ancestors did not find the need to obtain the GI Tag for the sweet. “We never received any support from the respective governments to begin the exercise of obtaining the GI Tag to protect the delicacy from any exploitation. Being non-literate, my father was ignorant of the GI Tag. The maximum support received from the State government to promote the sweet is to get a space in various exhibitions,” adds Mr. Kumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/n6oyaj/article32738346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01VJKHAJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kotaiah-family-to-apply-for-gi-tag-for-kakinada-kaja/article32738347.ece

101,2020/10/01,Scientists expect very low groundnut yield in Anantapur,"Excess rain impairs plant growth; leaf disease, pest attacks add to woes

Farmers were overjoyed when the southwest monsoon brought rains abundantly, but it has turned into a woe with the groundnut crop sown in close to 5 lakh hectares in the district getting badly affected due to water stagnation or excess mixture in the soil.

The scientists at the Agriculture Research Station, Rekulakunta have tested the crops sown in June, July and August to assess the likely yield, which brought the bad news that the average final yield is likely to be below 500 kg per hectare.

“Commercially to break even for a farmer, at least 700 kg per hectare is what we look forward to. With 539 mm rainfall recorded from June 1 till September 27, the groundnut crop has been badly damaged. We witnessed some lanky green crops, but with no pod formation or a very small one. Most of the crop sown in July had suffered a change of leaf colour from green to yellow with leaf spot disease setting in. Sucking pests ‘jassids’ attacked crop in a large area,” ARS Principal Scientist B. Sahadeva Reddy told The Hindu.

Poor flowering

The groundnut crop sown in June and July (47,050 hectares and 4,11,128 hectares respectively) witnessed thick vegetative growth with poor flowering and formation of pegs and conversion of pegs into pods. A high incidence of leaf spots and sucking pest attacks were seen on a large scale on K-6 variety of seed supplied on subsidy by the government as that is the most popular variety in the district. In August it was sown in 41,693 hectares.

In Rapthadu a tenant farmer, Vasundhara, who had sown in 10 acres has already incurred ₹2 lakh loss and many others are facing a similar fate.

Mr. Sahadeva Reddy suggests diversification of crops to avoid losses.

High failure rate

In 2008 when there was excess rainfall like the current season, the yield was 88 kg/hectare.

In the last 25 years profitable groundnut yields were recorded only in seven years – 1995 (1,310 kg/ha), 1996 (711), 1998 (1,145), 2000 (1,116), 2004 (798), 2007 (1,258) and in 2017 (992).",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/uma9yu/article32738327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30VIJ4GROUNDNUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/scientists-expect-very-low-groundnut-yield-in-anantapur/article32738328.ece

Illegal quarrying and transport of mining material in heavy vehicles have become a bane for thousands of people living in Laveru, Ranasthalam, Tekkali, Santabommali and surrounding mandals.

The Panchayat Rraj Department laid roads a couple of years ago in many routes including Bejjipuram-Bontalapeta of Laveru mandal of Srikakulam district.

The roads’ condition is also horrible in several places including Mettavalasa, Rowthupeta-Ravada, and other villages of Srikakulam district.

105,2020/10/01,Treasure-hunters’ gang nabbed in Chittoor,"They had allegedly damaged a Nandi idol two days ago.

The Chittoor police on Wednesday nabbed an eight-member inter-State gang allegedly involved in the desecration of a Nandi idol at an ancient temple near Chittoor in the early hours of September 27.

Addressing a press conference here, Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar said the Nandi idol at the temple at Agaramangalam village of GD Nellore mandal was uprooted from its pedestal and allegedly broken into pieces by the accused. Three special parties were formed to nab the culprits. After three-days of investigation, it was found to be the handiwork of a treasure-hunting gang.

Acting on a tip-off that a six-member gang was moving about in the surroundings of Kanipakam temple, 12 km from Chittoor, a police team rushed to the spot and nabbed them as they were about to flee from the place.

Sand artist Sanath Kumar created a sand sculpture of Sonu Sood in the wake of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) conferring the prestigious SDG Special Humanitarian Action Award on the actor.

Giving finishing touches to the sand sculpture at Eruru, near Chillakur in Nellore district, Mr. Sanath Kumar said that the UN body had aptly recognised the actor who had helped stranded migrants during the COVID-19 lockdown by arranging food, buses, trains and flights for them to go back to their hometowns.

The artist took over three hours to create the sculpture using two tonnes of sand. The aim behind the sculpture is to inspire like-minded individuals here to reach out to vulnerable sections hit hard by COVID-19, Mr. Sanath Kumar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/423ji/article32736504.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-VJ-SANDSCULPTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/artist-creates-sand-sculpture-of-sonu-sood/article32736505.ece
108,2020/10/01,Tourists begin trickling in at Chittoor waterfalls,"Many are brimming after several years; most picnickers are from Tamil Nadu

Many of the major waterfalls in Chittoor district are brimming again after a gap of several years, thanks to copious rains this year.

The waterfalls are a prime tourist attraction, particularly for tourists from Tamil Nadu. This year, however, all of the picnic spots were closed to visitors due to the COVID-19 lockdown that was clamped in March. Now, visitors are arriving at the waterfalls in increasing numbers over the past few days with restrictions on inter-State travel gradually being eased.

The Ubbalamadugu eco-tourism project, popularly known as Tada falls, is a major attraction for nature lovers who keep thronging the spot round the year. The visitors are mostly from Chennai and bordering areas of Tamil Nadu.

Due to the lockdown, forest officials and the Satyavedu circle police intensified surveillance on the forest road leading to the falls here, preventing youth from visiting the falls. But for the last month, visitors are going all the way up to the waterfalls by taking a detour through forest areas and avoiding checkposts.

The Bhupateswara Kona falls near Nagalapuram has also emerged as an alternative picnic destination for youth. These two falls, over the years, have witnessed many youth from Tamil Nadu drowning in the swirling waters. Compared to previous years, the flow of water is much stronger this year due to four months of heavy rains, say officials.

The Kailasakona waterfalls near Puttur at the Nagari foothills are another haven for picnic lovers, with a large number of them making their way to the spot in the absence of surveillance. At present, the forest post at the area is defunct with no personnel to guard it. The presence of police personnel too is missing at the archway, besides the Puttur-Chennai NH. The waterfalls at Sadasivakona hill, Moolakona, Singiri Kona and Pasupu Kona in the eastern mandals are also witnessing considerable crowds now.

The Talakona waterfalls, nestled in the Seshachalam biosphere, 40 km from Tirupati, sees several youth try their best to reach the spot but in vain. In addition to the forest checkpost, 3 km away from the waterfalls, a police picket has also come up at the local Shiva temple there in recent weeks.

“Though the Unlock measures have begun, visitors at Talakona waterfalls are not seen now as the ban on picnic activity continues there. Booking of guest houses is also blocked for visitors at present,” said Circle Inspector (Piler Rural) Murali Krishna.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/u24x6n/article32736478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-VJ-WATERFALLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tourists-begin-trickling-in-at-chittoor-waterfalls/article32736479.ece
109,2020/10/01,Renovated Bapu Museum to be inaugurated by CM today,"Latest technologies have been used to provide visitors an immersive experience

The renovated Bapu Museum is all set for re-opening by Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, on Thursday.

“Using latest technologies like Virtual and Augmented Reality, digital display panel and an immersive projection theatre, we have transformed the museum into an interactive space,” said G. Vani Mohan, Commissioner, Archaeology and Museums, at a press conference on Wednesday.

She said that the 1,500 antiquities at the museum, belonging to different eras from 10,00,000 BC to the 19th century, would be used to promote heritage and culture education. The displays include pre, proto and early historical objects, Jain and Buddha sculptures, pottery, plaques, beads and bangles, iron implements, coins, inscriptions, textiles, paintings and celadon ware, among other things.

The nine galleries are categorised under pre- and early historic gallery, Jain and Buddhist gallery, Hindu sculptures, epigraphy, numismatic, textile, painting, medieval century prospective and arms and weapons galleries.

A project mapping with a theme ‘Glories of Andhra’ had been developed to educate the younger generations about the culture and heritage of the Andhra land.

Ms. Vani Mohan said that the cabinets were furnished with Korean sheets for greater life, longevity and a fine look. There are four interactive cabinet displays on Buddhism and Jainism, temples in Andhra Pradesh, forts and monuments and excavations and epigraphy. A 16-feet digital interactive wall panel will serve as a one-stop place to know all about the antiquities in the museum. The automatic scroll and display of the 1,500 exhibits at a time and detailed information on them along with historical nuggets is a highlight.

Novel initiatives

The Commissioner said use of Augmented Reality for sculptures in a museum was the first of its kind initiative in the country. “One can hear the images speak by scanning them on their smartphones. So is the case with VR (Virtual Reality) technology, which will allow visitors to experience real environment in a more immersive way,” she said.

A digital book, yet another first of its kind initiative in the country, displays the top 10 Buddhist heritage sites in the world using a projector. Besides, there is an interactive kiosk with questions and answers awaiting the visitors at the end of their journey in the museum.

She said the visitors would have the privilege to participate in a quiz and a certificate of appreciation would be given to the participants.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tcyd53/article32736471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-VJ-BAPUMUSEUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/renovated-bapu-museum-to-be-inaugurated-by-cm-today/article32736472.ece
110,2020/10/01,Repatriate children staying in CCIs with families: NCPCR,"Child labour, marriage, abuse high in State, allege activists

The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has recently directed the State government to take measures for repatriation of eligible children staying in Child Care Institutions (CCIs) with their families.

The Commission observed that the number of Children in Need of Care and Protection (CNCP) staying in children homes (CCIs) are in excess numbers, posing a risk to their rights and protection, and are deprived of a natural home atmosphere and parental affection.

The country’s apex child rights body noted that 1.84 lakh children (about 70%) are residing at CCIs in eight States, including Andhra Pradesh, out of a total of 2.56 lakh staying at children homes across the country.

Women Development and Child Welfare (WD&CW) Director Krithika Shukla said that 27,243 children were residing in 894 CCIs in the State before the lockdown. As per the directions of the Supreme Court, and in view of the COVID-19 rules, the WD&CW Department directed the CCIs to close schools running on their premises and repatriate eligible children with their families or guardians.

“At present, 2,675 children are staying at 265 government and private CCIs. Children who are orphans and could not be repatriated are residing in children homes,” Ms. Shukla said.

Child rights activists allege that child labour, abuse in some children homes, minor marriages and child trafficking were high, and the laws and Acts aimed for protecting children were not being implemented properly in the State.

“Due to poor coordination between Education, Endowments, Revenue, WD&CW and other departments, child marriages and child selling is rampant in the State. Some organisations are conducting meetings on implementation of related laws and sensitisation programmes just for the sake of formality and the resolutions are limited to paper,” an NGO representative fighting for child rights said.

Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang, at a press conference held recently, said police rescued nearly 11,000 children under ‘Operation Muskaan’ in A.P. in the last four years.

Many children who were separated from their families by being kidnapped and trafficked, or those who ran away from homes due to broken family conditions and poverty, were slogging at NGO homes, police officers who participated in the drive said.

Crime Investigation Department (CID) Additional Director General P.V. Sunil Kumar, who monitored the drive, said that around 4,800 children, including 3,600 girls and 59 from other States, were rescued during the sixth phase of Operation Muskaan conducted in June this year.

Commissioner (Labour) G. Rekha Rani, who participated in a meeting on child labour recently, said that steps are being taken to increase the number of National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Schools, also known as Special Training Centres, in the State as the number of children engaged in child labour was high.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/n292br/article32736459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-VJ-MUSKAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/repatriate-children-staying-in-ccis-with-families-ncpcr/article32736460.ece

Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA-Chintoor) Project Officer A. Venkata Ramana on Wednesday agreed to convene a consultative meeting on the Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) package for the Polavaram project displaced, at Chintoor in East Godavari district in one week.

Following the assurance, the tribal people, who had been staging a relay hunger strike for the last 25 days at Kunavaram, relented and withdrew the strike.

Post the floods in the Godavari in September, the people affected by the project launched protests demanding that the R&R issue be settled immediately.

113,2020/10/01,Left parties stage dharna against Centre’s ‘anti-farmer’ policies,"The three farm Acts will only help MNCs, says Narayana

The Left parties on Wednesday staged a demonstration opposing the passage of three ‘anti-farmer’ Bills in Parliament, stating that they adversely affected the rights of the farming community that constitutes 69% of the population.

CPI national general secretary K. Narayana, along with CPI(M) district secretary V. Rambhupal, was arrested for staging a demonstration in front of the BSNL office here. Leaders of four Left parties participated in the dharna protesting against the “anti-worker and anti-farmer” of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre.

‘Wholesale middlemen’

Mr. Narayana said the three farm Acts, which were passed in Parliament without any discussion, would reduce small landholders to farm labourers. In the guise of removing (retail) middlemen, the Central government was handing over the entire business to ‘wholesale middlemen’ such as Reliance, Microsoft and other large MNCs, he added

“These multi-nationals have invested ₹90,000 crore in the retail chains in India, and to feed them at a throwaway price, the Centre has removed the public marketing system, which ensures Minimum Support Price for the farmers’ produce. Now, the MNCs will dictate the terms and decide the price at which the producers will be forced to sell,” Mr. Narayana lamented.

TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy were toeing the BJP line to protect their personal interests, he alleged.

“The Prime Minister has privatised the higher education and power sectors. It is now the turn of agriculture,” Mr. Narayana alleged.

“The spirit of federalism has gone with the Centre vesting all the powers with itself. Right from the CBI to the RBI and to CAG, the BJP has tightened its grip on all the institutions,” he alleged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gmsrwv/article32736396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01ONG4NARAYANAANATAPUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/left-parties-stage-dharna-against-centres-anti-farmer-policies/article32736397.ece

In a statement on Wednesday, the commission secretary said a fresh notification would be released.

The decision was taken in response to the requests by candidates who have failed to apply previously for the tests due to fear of the pandemic that was supposed to be at peak in August.

Members of the Janata Dal (Secular), under the leadership of former Minister H.D. Revanna, here on Thursday staged a protest alleging attempts by an official of Department of Cooperation to delay the elections to two cooperative bodies in the district.

The term of the elected bodies of the Hassan District Central Cooperative Wholesale Marketing Society and Sanjeevini Cooperative Hospital, Medical Education and Research Institute, has ended, necessitating elections.

The five elephants from the jungle camps shortlisted to participate in what will be a low-key Dasara due to COVID-19, left Veeranahosahalli for Mysuru on Thursday.

The symbolic march of the elephants from the jungle camps to the city is a grand event every year and entails a huge gathering. But given the imperatives of maintaining social distancing and the need to discourage people from congregating in large numbers, Gajapayana – as the event is called - was a simple affair devoid of any paraphernalia.

But the elephants were given a traditional send-off complete with prayers for their collective safety during their short sojourn in the city and completion of the festival. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, Deputy Conservator of Forests of Nagarahole Mahesh Kumar and other officials from the district administration were present.

Normally, the elephants stay on for nearly 45 days in Mysuru to get acclimatised to the din and noise of the crowd and familiarise themselves with the procession route. But as the festivities have been curtailed this year due to the pandemic, the elephants will not be subjected to the rigours of marching along the procession route daily.

Abhimanyu (54), known for his formidable courage and who tends to be the team leader in operations to capture tigers or elephant herds straying into human landscape, led the herd of five elephants to Mysuru.

The other elephants accompanying him were Vikrama, Gopi, Vijaya and Kaveri. Normally, 11 to 12 elephants take part in Dasara but their numbers have been reduced to 5 as the procession will be confined to the palace premises and will be a symbolic affair.

Abhimanyu has taken over the mantle of carrying the golden howdah and the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari – during Jamboo Savari - from Arjuna who has been rested due to his advancing age.

The elephants reached Mysuru by 3 p.m. and rested overnight at the Aranya Bhavan campus from where they will be taken to the palace premises on Friday. Over the next 3 weeks till the completion of the procession within the palace to be held on October 27, the elephants will train and carry sand bags matching the weight of the golden howdah. But the length of the procession route this year is hardly 500 metres against 5 km which used to be the distance from palace premises to Bannimantap, every year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dib286/article32747292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BGELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/abhimanyu-other-jumbos-arrive-for-low-key-dasara/article32747270.ece

Not only did they delay taking action against the guilty, they tried to even ruin the investigation by conducting the funeral of the victim in a hurried manner,” he said.

He called the whole incident a shame to civilised society and said the U.P. police had denied even a decent burial for the victim and prevented the family members from even participating in the funeral.

Mr. Jakkappanavar said the U.P. Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, had brought disgrace to the saffron cloth he wore and utterly failed in governance. As under him, the State has become a “safe haven for rapists, goons and murderers”, he should immediately order a judicial inquiry into the incident and then tender his resignation from the post, the Congress leader said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hathras-horror-kpcc-sc-department-condemns-up-police-cm/article32747070.ece
123,2020/10/01,Hathras horror: Congress leader Khandre seeks President’s rule in Uttar Pradesh,"Condemning the Hathras gang-rape and criticising the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh for its “failure” to maintain law and order in the State, Eshwar Khandre, working president of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), on Thursday demanded imposition of the President’s rule in that State.

“The law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh is completely out of gear. Crimes against women and marginalised communities have become the order of the day. The Hathras gang-rape is the latest example of the lawlessness in the State. The victim, belonging to an oppressed community, was brutally gang-raped and assaulted. When she died after a fortnight-long struggle at the hospital, her body was not handed over to the family. The Yogi Adityanath government, which has failed to maintain the rule of the law, should immediately be dissolved and President’s rule should be imposed,” he said. Mr. Khandre was speaking to mediapersons at Hosapete in Ballari district.

Taking serious exception to the detention of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, who were on their way to Hathras to meet the family members of the victim, Mr. Khandre said the people in power would neither console the family members of the victim nor allow others to do so.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hathras-horror-congress-leader-khandre-seeks-presidents-rule-in-uttar-pradesh/article32747053.ece

125,2020/10/01,Mysuru-based JSS Academy to carry out clinical trials for Novavax COVID-19 vaccine,"JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research (JSSAHER), which has already begun phase three of the clinical trials for vaccine candidate Covishield at its facility in Mysuru, has been approached for human trials of Novavax, another COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by a U.S.-based company, as well as Russia’s Sputnik V.

JSSAHER Pro-Chancellor B. Suresh said the institution has consented to carrying out trials for Novavax, while the request on Sputnik V has been kept in abeyance.

Novavax, the U.S.-based biotechnology company, had entered into a manufacturing pact with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). “Novavax approached us through SII and we consented to it. We will be submitting the required documents shortly,” he said.

Though the institution was also approached for the human trials of Sputnik V, which has tied up with the Hyderabad-based Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Dr. Suresh said JSSAHER was still studying the proposal.

Apart from carrying out clinical studies for Covishield, the vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University and multi-national pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, JSSAHER has taken up human trials to study the efficacy of BCG, the anti-tuberculosis vaccine, against COVID-19.

As part of the studies on BCG vaccine, about 250 elderly citizens in the age group of 60 to 80 will be inoculated with a dose of the anti-tuberculosis vaccine and monitored for the presence of antibodies in their blood and their response in the context of COVID-19.

The flood of enquiries received by JSSAHER for carrying out human trials of COVID-19 vaccines comes in the backdrop of the legal requirements for manufacturing vaccines in the country. Dr. Suresh pointed out that a lot of interest has been generated for human trials in India because of the country’s huge capacity for manufacturing drugs. “Also, by law, you cannot manufacture the drug elsewhere and import it into India. If you are manufacturing in India a vaccine developed elsewhere, you should carry out the trials in India,” he said.

Manufacture of vaccines can be allowed in India only after trials are conducted in the country and evidence of the trials on Indian population submitted. “Only then can you make it available to the people of the country,” Dr. Suresh said.

Dr. Suresh also said phase three of the Covishield trials had begun after no adverse effect was shown on any of the 25 healthy volunteers who enrolled for the trials. Phase three is expected to test the immunogenicity of the vaccine, crucial to check if the shots had helped produce antibodies in the blood to fight COVID-19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/u9dnlb/article32737602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bg-mys-covid-GF97QDQKA3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jss-academy-in-mysuru-to-carry-out-clinical-trials-for-novavax-vaccine/article32746447.ece

129,2020/10/01,‘Banks have done well despite the pandemic situation’,"Despite the hardships caused by the COVID-19-induced lockdown, banks in Dharwad district have performed well during the first quarter ended in June 2020, Chief Executive Officer of the Dharwad Zilla Panchayat B.C. Sateesh has said.

Chairing a District Level Review Committee Meeting of the Lead Bank at the Zilla Panchayat Hall in Dharwad on Thursday, Mr. Sateesh asked bankers to give exemption to self-help groups from providing Permanent Account Number (PAN) while opening bank accounts.

Mr. Sateesh emphasised the need for ensuring timely service to the beneficiaries of various social security schemes and asked bankers not to adjust crop insurance relief amount with any of the loan accounts. He pointed out that directions had already been issued at the national level and they should be followed correctly.

130,2020/10/01,Gate meetings in Hubballi against privatisation of Railways,"Their demands include dropping of the project to run 151 private trains on 109 routes

In response to the call for All India Agitation Week given by All Indian United Trade Union Centre (AITUC), members and office-bearers of the organisation held gate meetings at railway divisional offices here on Thursday, distributed pamphlets and submitted a memorandum pertaining to various demands.

The All India Agitation Week is being held opposing the BJP-led Union government’s move to privatise public sector companies, including the Railways, the recent amendments to farm bills, anti-labour policies and to press for various demands of workers of the unorganised sector. On Thursday, the protest was against the move to privatise the Railways.

During the gate meetings at the divisional railway offices of the Hubballi Division of the South Western Railway (SWR) here on Thursday, Dharwad district unit president Gangadhar Badiger said that during the second tenure of the Modi-led Union government, anti-labour and anti-people policies were being implemented without any hesitation and what was even shocking was that even profit-making public sector undertakings were being offered on a platter to private companies. The move had resulted in the loss of lakhs of job opportunities for the youths of the country, he said.

He said that because of the ill-planned and sudden lockdown imposed upon the country crores of construction and migrant workers were thrown to the streets and their life had not improved till date. “At a time when workers were looking at the government for help, the government has, instead, misused the situation to bring in more anti-labour and pro-corporate measures, which is highly condemnable. It is a clear indication that the government is acting at the behest of private companies,” he said.

After the gate meetings and distribution of pamphlets, the protestors submitted a memorandum addressed to the Prime Minister to the officials of the Divisional Railway Manager. Their demands included dropping of the project to run 151 private trains on 109 routes, no closure of railway workshops, agencies, hospitals and colonies or sale of railway property, filling vacant posts in railways, no handing over railway production units to corporate houses and others. Along with Mr. Badiger, AITUC office-bearers Ramesh Hoasamani, G.S. Petere, Gangadhar Dalabadi, Goodusab Kaladagi and others led the agitation and the gate meetings.

As part of the agitation week, workers of the unorganised sector are scheduled to stage a protest on Friday, scheme workers on Saturday and migrant workers on Sunday. A protest against privatisation of power supply and coal sector is scheduled to take place on October 5, against privatisation of banking and other financial institutions on October 6 and against labour law amendments on October 7.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gate-meetings-in-hubballi-against-privatisation-of-railways/article32744396.ece
131,2020/10/01,"Gram Seva Sangha to showcase, sell products of handloom weavers from North Karnataka","Gram Seva Sangha, a federation of handloom weavers and workers, will set up a showroom in Bengaluru to showcase and sell products of handloom weavers from North Karnataka.

This showroom will store and sell saris, clothing and other material made by handloom weavers and handicrafts persons from North Karnataka. This was decided in a meeting of various handloom workers and NGOs in Guledagudda village in Bagalkot district recently.

The meeting discussed various issues haunting the handloom sector and tried to explore solutions to them. One of the major decisions taken in the meeting was to convert consumers into hand-made activists by exposing them to the problems faced by workers and craftsmen. “Saving the hand-made is a sacred movement and we want to tell them to be part of this,” Prasanna, theatre personality and hand-made activist who was among those who spoke at the meeting, said.

It was also decided to start a State-wide campaign to find markets for hand-made products this month. An exhibition-cum-sale of handloom products will be held in the Gandhi Bhavan in Bengaluru till October 4. A series of deliberations will be held on October 3 and 4, in which modern designers, institutional buyers and marketing experts will participate. After that, the exhibition will move to select towns and cities in the State.

The sangha plans to work with designers and professionals in other fields for stage-wise improvements in the field of handloom and hand-made products, Mr. Prasanna said. Several organisations, including Participatory Guarantee Systems, All India Handloom Federation and Karnataka Gandhi Smaraka Nidhi, are joining the effort.

“In the Guledgudda meeting, we decided to raise 10 questions before all our elected representatives about rural development and condition of artisans,” Mr. Prasanna said.

“Our motto is ‘Delhi should come to us and we will not go to Delhi’. We are giving out a message that we are not fighting the governments. The governments at both levels — Central and State — are bankrupt and they will not save us. We have to save ourselves. The people should protect us. This is as serious as a ‘second freedom movement’ and each one of us has to contribute in our own way. This is not an agitation of anger, but of love. Each city dweller should help rural residents. City-based families will be invited to visit villages where artisans work. They will be asked to spend a day or two among artisans. That will act as a picnic and help them in information download during discussion with weavers and craftsmen. It is a constructive programme and not a political movement,’’ he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gram-seva-sangha-to-showcase-sell-products-of-handloom-weavers-from-north-karnataka/article32743967.ece

Zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni said she made the donation on September 25 and added that her gesture in this difficult time for the zoo over the COVID-19 pandemic was invaluable besides being an inspiration for others.

State government has extended the deadline for app-based crop survey by farmers by another 15 days.

The deadline for the survey, that had started on August 24 with respect to kharif season, was supposed to end on Wednesday.

A circular says that the deadline has been extended following request by the deputy commissioners of various districts. According to a statement from Agriculture Minister B.C.

141,2020/10/01,Initiative to promote cycling among children gets good response,"We R Cycling and Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. intend to develop cycling lanes on by-lanes and main roads

About 25 children and their parents rode along with amateur riders to get the feel of the lanes and bylanes of the city in an effort by We R Cycling and Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) to popularise cycling as a mode of commute to schools. They rode about 10 km criss-crossing the heart of the city, passing through some of the city schools.

WERC, a group of amateur and professional cyclists intends to promote cycling as a mode of city commute besides encouraging cycling as a sport. It joined hands with MSCL to popularise Cycling for Change (C4C), a Central initiative for urban areas to promote cycling as a means of fitness today.

The ride commenced from Mangala Stadium and went along lanes around Kudroli, Car Street, Hampanakatte and M.G. Road before winding up at the stadium. Tiny tots on their bicycles were able to navigate lanes, ascents and descents with ease.

Speaking at the end, urban planner Niren Jain said the aim was to make rides hassle-free through bylanes and dedicated tracks on main roads. MSCL would make efforts to develop cycling tracks on these stretches, particularly for kids, he said.

MSCL MD Mohammed Nazeer urged Mangalureans to actively participate in the Cycle for Change event to be held shortly across all cities identified to be developed as Smart Cities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pw7maq/article32737155.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MNCYCLING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/initiative-to-promote-cycling-among-children-gets-good-response/article32737156.ece
142,2020/10/01,Karnataka registers highest number of sedition cases in the country,"It also recorded the maximum number of crimes against the State in India last year

Karnataka has recorded the highest number of sedition cases and cases related to crimes against the State in the country in 2019, as per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, which was released on Wednesday.

During this period, Karnataka registered 22 sedition cases against 23 persons, while insurgency-prone States like Jammu and Kashmir and many in the North East reported far fewer. It also registered 14 cases in sections related to other crimes against the State, taking the total number of cases booked for crimes against the State to 36. This is the highest for any State in the country for 2019.

Lack of discretion

Senior advocate S. Balan, who has worked as a defence advocate in several sedition cases, said the State police has lost a sense of discretion when it comes to filing sedition cases. “They are being filed at the drop of a hat. During the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests, sedition cases were booked against a person for holding a placard saying ‘Free Kashmir’. Another case was booked against an individual who said ‘Pakistan Zindabad’. The lower judiciary is also not using its discretion,” he said.

Mr. Balan also argued that sedition cases were being misused to target critics of the incumbent regime at the Centre. “People from minority communities were mostly the targets,” he added.

UAPA

However, NCRB data also points to another trend. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, seems to be the preferred law to tackle such crimes in other parts of the country, but not in Karnataka. While even Tamil Nadu registered 270 UAPA cases, Manipur, 306, and Jammu and Kashmir 255 cases, Karnataka registered only seven cases under UAPA. “However, Karnataka police are also fast catching up to this trend. How is it that the rioters at D.J. Halli were booked under UAPA? They do not belong to any proscribed organisation. It is an uneven legal response to the crime committed,” he said.

The crime rate in Karnataka for 2019 has only marginally increased compared to the previous year. As per the data, the State recorded a crime rate of 248.1 per lakh of population last year - a middling crime rate when compared to larger States in the country.

It recorded one of the lowest crime rates in rape at 1.6 per lakh of population. Only Bihar and Tamil Nadu have a lower rate.

Highest number of cases under SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act

Karnataka has remained one of the States that continues to report one of the highest cases registered under SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989. It reported 1,504 cases of atrocities against Scheduled Castes in 2019, up from 1,325 in 2018. It also reported 392 cases of atrocities against Scheduled Tribes, marginally higher than 2018. This only indicates better reporting of atrocities by Dalits, senior officials in the Karnataka Police maintain.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q3khr9/article32737151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BgCrimecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-registers-highest-number-of-sedition-cases-in-the-country/article32737154.ece
143,2020/10/01,"Coronavirus | Not wearing mask right can also attract fine of ₹1,000 in Karnataka","While a fine of ₹1,000 will be slapped against those who do not wear masks in urban areas, violators in rural areas will have to pay ₹500.

The State government has decided to slap hefty penalties on those flouting mask wearing and social distancing norms in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. Fine will be applicable even for those who do not cover their mouth and nose properly.

While a fine of ₹1,000 will be slapped against those who do not wear masks in urban areas, violators in rural areas will have to pay ₹500. Currently, the penalty for not wearing mask is ₹200. The jurisdictional police and revenue officials will be authorised to collect the fine.

An official order in this regard will be issued on Thursday after discussing with the Chief Minister, said Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar.

Within shops

Addressing presspersons after a meeting with top officials, the Minister said the number of people flouting mask wearing and social distancing norms was on the rise. “If social distancing is not maintained in front of shops in markets and malls, action will be initiated not just against the shoppers but also against the shopkeepers. The shopkeepers will be issued a notice and their licence will be suspended. They should not allow more than five persons to gather near their shops and should ensure a distance of 6 ft is maintained.”

Public gatherings

Not more than 50 people can attend public gatherings, events, and social functions, and if this is violated, action would be taken against the organisers of the events. Also, not more than 50% of the seats should be filled in public transport. Those not wearing masks would not be allowed to board public transport or attend work in government offices, the Minister said.

The State will also step up information, education, and communication (IEC) activities. “We will rope in religious leaders, politicians, film stars, and artists to create awareness,” the Minister said.

144,2020/10/01,Many parents now looking to enrol children in govt. schools,"Reasons range from lack of access to online classes to difficulty in paying fees

Many parents, especially those who had enrolled their children under the RTE quota in private schools, are turning to government schools for admissions. The reasons for this range from difficulty in accessing online classes, the lack of infrastructure, such as smartphones or laptops, and their inability to pay private school fees.

Others claim that officials from the Department of Public Instruction are reaching out to persuade them to pull their children out of the RTE reservation quota by reportedly telling them that their children will benefit from the Vidyagama programme, where government teachers will come to their neighbourhoods to teach students. .

Parameshwarappa, a farmer in Yadgir district, said that he pulled out his son who was studying in class 3 under the RTE quota in a private school and admitted him in a government school last week. “The private school was conducting online classes but my son was unable to attend them as I do not have a spare phone to give him. So I decided to admit him in a government school as I did not want him to loiter and waste one full year. After we submitted the transfer certificate of a private school, the teachers are now teaching him under the Vidyagama programme,” he said. The shift for many students may be abrupt as they will be moving from English-medium private schools to government schools where Kannada is the medium of instruction.

Education experts and RTE activists are worried about the consequences of this and the impact on the child’s education. “Many parents are listening to officials and removing them from private schools. But once they pull out their children who are admitted under the RTE quota out of private schools, they will be unable to go back to the private school in the coming academic year,” said RTE Students and Parents’ Association chief secretary B.N. Yogananda.

According to him, families are only thinking of this academic year as they are facing financial hardship. Although the State government reimburses the school managements for tuition fees, parents each year are forced to bear overhead costs of extra-curricular activities, smart classes, and uniforms, among others.

Currently, there are around 5.37 lakh students studying under the RTE quota from LKG to class 8.

Another cause for concern is the fate of those students who were admitted under the RTE quota to private schools and have completed class 8 this year. They are left in the lurch as the reservation quota has not been extended for class 9.

An autorickshaw driver from Bengaluru whose daughter is in such a situation said that he has no choice but to consider a government school. “I will not be able to pay fees in the same private school,” he added.

A senior official of the department said that parents should not withdraw admission from the RTE quota. ""Once they withdraw admissions from the RTE quota, they cannot continue to avail the reservation benefits,"" he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jujcx8/article32736329.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGPG51,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/many-parents-now-looking-to-enrol-children-in-govt-schools/article32736330.ece

This does not mean that the restrictions will be lifted after a fortnight. “A decision on whether school visits will be allowed after October 15 will be taken after consulting with health experts,” said a senior department official.

150,2020/10/01,Grandeur to be restored to Attingal Palace,"Government sanctions ₹1.05 crore for conservation of historic structure

A witness to the first organised revolt against the British in 1721, the Attingal Palace is set to get a fresh lease of life. The sprawling complex is crumbling and in need of urgent conservation.

Attingal was historically the residence of women rulers of the royal family of erstwhile Travancore.

The son of the senior matriarch of Attingal was crowned the king of Travancore.

Now, the State government has sanctioned ₹1.05 crore for the conservation of the dilapidated structure. Archaeology Director E. Dinesh said priority would be given to structural conservation.

The entrance to the complex through a two-storey Padippura is in ruins.

With massive pillars carved out from stone and wood, the Padippura is in bad shape – the wood has decayed and the roof tiles are broken, causing seepage and structural damage. Some of the columns are missing and the handrails will require rebuilding.

The floor, once paved with terracotta tiles, has a cemented finish, a report prepared by the department on the palace said.

The complex comprises Naalukettu, Nadapanthal, Kothalam, and Oottupura, none of which fare much better.

Original structure

The original structure has undergone many changes. The Naalukettu has been altered on three sides.

It has been connected to the Oottupura using iron girder and asbestos sheet.

To the south, reinforced cement concrete roof slabs are also visible.

A number of materials such as wood, stone, lime work, different types of tiles, and so on have been used from the basement to the superstructure of the palace complex. Outside, the courtyard is covered with interlocking pavement tiles but the water collected under them is harming the palace structure. Banyan trees grow rampant and thick creepers cover the retaining wall, while the lime plastering of the compound wall is coming apart.

Mr. Dinesh said attempts were on to remove as many of these changes as possible and the restore the structure to the original form in line with conservation principles.

He said the government had earmarked ₹3 crore in the State Budget for the conservation of the palace.

Conservation

Immediate conservation was imperative, and the sanction of ₹1.05 crore would help launch the work.

After e-tendering the work, the department expected to move to conservation aspects soon, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/onn6m6/article32747648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Attingal-Palace,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/grandeur-to-be-restored-to-attingal-palace/article32747630.ece
151,2020/10/01,Safety concerns over Gap Road works,"Three Subcollectors have raised issues of unscientific construction in their reports

As a decision to restart the widening works on the Gap Road stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway is likely on Friday, the focus is on reports of three Subcollectors that have raised concerns over safety aspects of the works.

A series of landslips on the stretch had damaged the road and nearby agriculture land.

The report submitted by Devikulam Subcollector S. Prem Krishnan says that irrevocable damage has been done due to large-scale blasting and unscientific road widening works on the ecologically sensitive stretch.

Earlier, Subcollectors V.R.Premkumar and Renuraj had also given reports on the unscientific construction on the stretch.

The report submitted by the Subcollector to the Revenue Principal Secretary recommends an inquiry into the lapses on the part of the contractor and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials on the ‘unscientific’ road widening work that triggered the landslips.

As the road was at an elevation of 5,000 ft, safety aspects taking into consideration the sensitivity of rock formation and soil conditions should have been followed. It should be probed whether soil stability test and environment impact assessment were done prior to the road works.

“Earlier, Gap Road was made in an eco-safe manner and no landslips or mudslides had been reported on the stretch. After the road widening work was undertaken by the NHAI, more than 15 landslips had been reported on the single stretch,” it says.

Quarrying activities

The report also calls for an inquiry into the quarrying activities there.

“Unscientific and large-scale mining activities carried out in the region as part of the road work have resulted in environmental destruction in the region with irretrievable loss to the ecology.”

The report also demands an inspection of the quarrying works inside the road alignment level. A primary inspection found that the contractor conducted illegal quarrying in poramboke land.

It also raises concern on the manner in which inspection was done by NHAI officials. On October 8, 2019 a major landslip caused death of two workers.

After the landslip, a report was submitted by experts from the National Institute of Technology (NIT) and the works were resumed. But a series of landslips was again reported in the region.

In a landslip on June 17, 2020 nearly 200 metres of the Gap Road stretch was swept away.

More than 13 acre of cardamom cultivation also suffered damage.

It is estimated that more than two dozen landslips have occurred on the stretch in the past two years. The stretch was closed for traffic considering the chances of landslips in June.

The ₹268.2-crore road-widening works on the Munnar -Bodimettu stretch was started in 2017.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/f2fmg4/article32747616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gap-road-3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/safety-concerns-over-gap-road-works/article32747601.ece

154,2020/10/01,Kerala HC seeks explanation from CBSE schools on fee collection,"It also asks what concessions can be offered to students

The Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the CBSE school managements’ association to file a statement explaining under what heads they are allowing their member schools to charge fees for the 2020-2021 academic year.

Justice Devan Ramachandran also asked the association to state the concessions that they can offer to students, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Plea by schools

The directives were passed on a petition filed by various school managements alleging that the parents of the students were unfairly taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic and refusing to pay the fees for the 2020-2021 academic year.

The petitioners sought a directive to the State Police Chief to ensure that no disruption was caused to the functioning of their School by parents or any others. They contended that that they were entitled to charge the same fee which they had charged for the year 2019-2020.

Access to facilities

The court noted that the managements had not explained how they could collect such fees, when the students were denied many physical facilities on account of the online classes.

The road renovation work is envisaged to be completed in 18 months. KMC Constructions has been given the contract, and it will be responsible for immediate repair work for the next five years, said the Chief Minister. He said the work on Attappady-Thavalam road too would begin soon.

The Chief Minister said that 11,000-km road and more than 100 bridges damaged in the floods were repaired by spending ₹1,783 crore. About 5,000 roads are being repaired under the rural road development scheme. Road repair is being done to the tune of ₹950 crore with the help of NABARD. Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) is funding ₹14,700 crore for road and infrastructure development in the State.

Presiding over the function, Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran said that most modern technology was being adopted in road repairs in the State. About ₹1 crore is spent for a km length of road, he said.

He said the PWD would press the contracting companies to complete the work in time.

157,2020/10/01,Block-level FLTCs in Palakkad by Oct. 5,"General Hospital reaches full capacity, private hospitals set aside beds for COVID patients

The district is set to open first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) at the block-level by October 5 as the spurt in COVID-19 cases continues unabated.

Minister for Welfare of SC, ST and OBC A.K. Balan said here on Thursday that all COVID-19 cases without health complications would be treated at block-level FLTCs.

The Minister said that more attention could be given to those in category B and C COVID-19 cases. Briefing the media after a COVID-19 review meeting, Mr. Balan said that the General Hospital here, the designated COVID-19 hospital of Palakkad, had reached its full capacity.

He said arrangements were being made for treatment of COVID-19 patients in private hospitals if the spurt continued in the coming months.

A special ward with 24 ICU beds was kept aside for COVID-19 treatment at General Hospital. Similarly, 14 rooms were kept aside for pregnant women who test positive for COVID-19 at Government Women and Children Hospital.

“Besides, Government Medical College here and FLTCs at Pattambi, Peringottukurissi, Government Victoria College, KINFRA and Agali are also offering treatment,” he said.

District Collector D. Balamurali said that plans were afoot to increase the number of daily tests in the district.

Mr. Balan said that arrangements were made at Kerala Medical College at Mangod for treating category-B COVID-19 patients. Two ventilators and 100 beds with an oxygen facility were arranged there. “We can treat 300 patients at Mangod,” he said.

Several private hospitals in the district too began COVID-19 treatment facilities. Valluvanad Hospital has kept aside 60 beds for COVID-19 patients. Thankam Hospital has arranged 32 oxygen kits as part of gearing up for COVID-19 . PK Das Medical College has 100 beds and two ventilators for COVID-19 treatment. Palana and Welcare Hospitals have kept aside 20 beds each, Avitis Hospital has readied 15 beds and Lakshmi Hospital has kept aside eight beds for COVID-19.

According to Mr. Balan, 2,007 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients were currently isolated at home in the district. “We are ensuring effective health care for those people,” he said.

“If asymptomatic cases continue to remain in home isolation, we will be able to give more care for B-category cases in FLTCs.

Mr. Balan said nearly ₹1 crore was collected from the people for violating COVID-19 restrictions. As many as 68,000 cases were registered.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/block-level-fltcs-in-palakkad-by-oct-5/article32744845.ece
158,2020/10/01,Academics allege unnecessary rush in introducing new-generation courses in Kerala’s universities,"Degree, PG courses as suggested by Sabu Thomas panel

A section of the academic community has accused the Higher Education Department and universities of rushing through with the introduction of new-generation courses in affiliated colleges. There are apprehensions about job prospects as well.

They claim that the department on September 9 asked the universities in the State to call for applications from accredited aided and government colleges and unaccredited aided colleges started by Scheduled Tribes Trusts for starting new undergraduate and post-graduate courses as suggested by the Sabu Thomas commission.

Notification

The University of Calicut issued a notification dated September 22 on its website on September 16. The last date for filing applications was September 23. The university released a list of recommended courses on September 25.

Kannur University issued a similar notification on September 18 and the last date for submitting applications was September 21, which was later extended to September 23. Details about the list of recommended courses in the university were not known. There was reportedly a similar rush in the case of the University of Kerala and Mahatma Gandhi University as well. In some instances, the colleges were not allotted courses of their choice.

Syllabus

“Normally, the syllabus for a course is prepared by the Board of Studies of the university, taking enough time. Autonomous colleges have their own system for the purpose. But how is it possible to do it in such a short time and what is the need for the hurry?” an assistant professor in a prominent aided college in Kozhikode asked.

There was an issue of duplication of courses too. There is plan to introduce M.Sc. Biology. However, subjects such as computational biology and drug designing are already part of postgraduate courses in biotechnology and molecular biology. The existing M.Sc. course in botany has been completely removed from the list of new courses. Teachers said that those who graduated in courses such as molecular biology and biotechnology were already finding it difficult to get jobs and how the renaming would help was not clear.

Old courses remain

Sources in the board of studies for undergraduate courses in the University of Calicut, however, pointed out that new courses were being introduced without altering the existing ones. The concerns raised about M.Sc. (Botany) would be addressed soon, they added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/academics-allege-unnecessary-rush-in-introducing-new-generation-courses-in-keralas-universities/article32744577.ece
159,2020/10/01,Motorists need carry only digital documents,"Law enforcers will not demand registration certificate, driving licence in physical form

Vehicular documents, including registration certificate, and driving licence of motorists, found validated through electronic means will not be demanded in physical forms for inspection by the law enforcers.

Instead, the motorists can show the documents in digital format in the mParivahan, the mobile application of the MoRTH that allows users to get details of vehicles such as owner name, vehicle manufacturer, insurance and fitness validity among others or in the DigiLocker, the national Digital Locker System launched for providing paperless governance.

Use of IT services and electronic monitoring is expected to lead to better enforcement of traffic rules, end complaints of harassment and hassle-free travel. The step towards easing commuter convenience has been possible with the Centre digitising documents, including maintenance of the motor vehicles, driving licences and e-challans from Thursday.

Better enforcement

In Kerala, the introduction of e-challan by Motor Vehicles Department in January this year and followed by the Kerala Police in five major cities have come in handy. “The enforcement has been tightened and erring motorists are being booked on the spot using hand-held machines. The vehicles coming from other States cannot now escape checking as details can be verified,” Joint Transport Commissioner Rajeev Puthalath said.

If the details of the documents are found validated through the electronic means by the enforcement officer, then physical forms of such documents will not be demanded, including in cases where there is an offence made out necessitating for the seizure of documents.

Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) has issued notifications regarding various amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules 1989 requiring the implementation of enforcement, Maintenance of Vehicular Documents and e-Challans for better monitoring and enforcement of the MV Rules.

Keeping tab

Henceforth, details of driving licences disqualified or revoked by the licensing authority will be recorded chronologically in the portal and will be updated on a regular basis on the portal. This will keep the law enforcers to keep a tab on the driving behaviour.

Already, amendments have been made in the Motor Vehicles (Driving) Regulations 2017 to align it to the Amendment in the Act such as the use of hand-held devices and inspection of documents in electronic form.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/motorists-need-carry-only-digital-documents/article32744414.ece
160,2020/10/01,Special drive against COVID in Alappuzha,"Month-long campaign to focus on protecting 3.33 lakh elderly people

In view of a surge in COVID-19 cases, especially locally transmitted ones, the Alappuzha district administration launched a special campaign titled Karutham Alappuzhaye on Thursday.

The month-long campaign is aimed at tackling the spread of the disease by creating awareness and taking protective measures against the disease. As part of it, masks were distributed to the elderly in the district under the aegis of the Social Justice Department. It was inaugurated by District Collector A. Alexander at the Civil Station here.

According to Mr. Alexander, Karutham Alappuzhaye is an elaborate campaign with a special focus on protecting 3.33 lakh elderly people in the district from contracting COVID-19.

Officials said a seven-day cleaning drive would be organised across the district starting October 2. The people have been urged to disinfect their houses and workplaces using liquid bleach. Government offices will also be cleaned. Besides, a host of awareness programmes will be organised in the coming days. The campaign is being organised by coordinating various government departments.

To ensure the support of the public, a Facebook page titled Karutham Alappuzhaye was created. People can send reports and photos of various COVID-19 prevention measures to the email id karuthamalappuzhaye@gmail.com.

161,2020/10/01,Kerala receives normal rainfall,"It recorded 2,227.9 mm rain during the southwest monsoon

Kerala received nine per cent excess rainfall during the 2020 southwest monsoon season.

The State recorded 2,227.9 mm against 2,049.2 mm which is normal for the June 1-September 30 period. In India Meteorological Department (IMD) parlance, the southwest monsoon was ‘normal’ over Kerala this year since percentage departures between -19% and +19% is considered ‘normal’ rainfall.

In 2018 and 2019, Kerala had recorded higher amounts of rainfall. The State recorded 2515.73 mm (23.34% excess) in 2018, and 2309.8 mm (12.72%) in 2019.

Five districts recorded ‘excess’ rainfall in the 2020 season: Kannur (28%), Kasaragod (21%), Kottayam (24%), Kozhikode (33%), Thiruvananthapuram (33%). The remaining districts reported normal rainfall.

The Lakshadweep Islands recorded 33% excess rainfall this year, and Mahe, 37% excess rainfall.

This year, the southwest monsoon had set in over Kerala on June 1. In August, more than 60 people died in a landslip triggered by torrential rain in Pettimudi in Idukki district.

162,2020/10/01,Unions’ plea to make HIL part of FACT,"NITI Aayog has mooted winding up of Hindustan Insecticides Limited

Trade unions at the Hindustan Insecticides Limited (HIL) unit at Udyogamandal have suggested that the government could consider making the unit a part of the public sector Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Limited (FACT) to prevent HIL’s winding up operations in Kerala.

The suggestion has come even as NITI Aayog is reported to have recommended the closure of HIL.

Trade union sources said that the Central planning establishment suggested in early September that HIL operations be wound up as it was not viable to disinvest a part of the 100 per cent government holdings and list the company.

A meeting of trade unions cutting across party affiliations here on October 6 will chalk out a plan of action and discuss the future. A total of 107 employees on the rolls of the company and about 60 contract workers are a worried lot as the future looks bleak for them.

The HIL unit near Kalamassery is one of the oldest public sector undertakings in the state. Established in 1957, HIL was on the forefront of efforts to contain diseases like malaria and kala azar. Later, the company turned to producing agro pesticides. DDT, BHC and later Endosulfan were produced at the unit here. Of late it has been producing Mancozeb, glyphocete and pendimethalin.

K. N. Rupesh, general secretary of HIL Employees’ Organisation, BMS, said that all trade unions would participate in the meeting being held on October 6 at the SCS Menon Hall, Eloor. He said that the unions wanted the State government also to step in to prevent the closure of the unit.

He said that the employees were ready to accept the suggestions by the Union government to make the unit viable. The salaries of the employees and officers have been delayed of late and there has been no revision of wages over the last five years, he added.

The employees’ unions planned to approach the Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers and to make suggestions on turning the unit into a viable one, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/unions-plea-to-make-hil-part-of-fact/article32743929.ece
163,2020/10/01,"Let CBI probe alleged irregularities, observes HC","LIFE Mission CEO asked to cooperate with investigation

The Kerala High Court on Thursday orally observed that the investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the alleged irregularities in the LIFE Mission housing project in Wadakancherry, Thrissur, could not be stopped.

Justice V.G. Arun made the observation during the hearing on a petition filed by LIFE Mission Chief Executive Officer (CEO) U.V. Jose seeking to quash the First Information Report (FIR) registered by the CBI at a magistrate court here in connection with the alleged irregularities in the project.

Observing that there were certain grey areas in the issue, the judge said “Let the investigation go on”. The court also asked the CEO to cooperate with the probe.

The court also declined orally a plea by Senior Supreme Court lawyer K.V. Viswanathan, counsel for the CEO, to restrain the CBI from taking any coercive measures against the CEO. The lawyer said that the agency had issued a notice summoning the CEO to produce certain documents in connection with the project. Unless a protective order was passed, the morale of all the officers would be affected.

‘Politically motivated’

The counsel for the CEO further contended that the filing of the FIR was a politically motivated move. The FIR had alleged violation of Section 3 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. In fact, the LIFE Mission had not accepted any contribution, much less any foreign contributions. The contractual agreements for the construction of buildings under the LIFE Mission were executed between the Consular General of the United Arab Emirate (UAE) and construction companies. Neither the State government nor the LIFE Mission had any role in the selection of contractors. The role of the government was only to make available land for the project.

The construction companies that had inked agreements with the Consular General of UAE did not come under any categories of persons prohibited from receiving any foreign contributions under Section 3 of the Act, he further argued. The category of the persons included election candidates, correspondents, columnist, cartoonist, editor, owner, printer or publisher of a registered newspaper, judges, government servants, or employee of government-controlled bodies and political parties.

‘At embryonic stage’

The counsel for the CBI submitted that the investigation “is in an embryonic stage”. It had to be taken forward to find out whether the companies were acting as proxies for government officers or agency for receiving kickbacks. The CBI counsel also contended that that the petition was not maintainable as the CEO had no locus standi to file the petition. In fact, the CEO had not been named in the FIR. Nor had any officers been specifically identified by the agency.

The court adjourned to October 8 the petition for further hearing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/let-cbi-probe-alleged-irregularities-observes-hc/article32743831.ece
164,2020/10/01,Customs takes Karat Faizal into custody,"Koduvally municipality councillor being quizzed in connection with gold smuggling case

The diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case assumed a new dimension with the Cochin Customs (Preventive) taking into custody Karat Faizal, an LDF-backed Independent councillor of Koduvally municipality in Kozhikode district, in the early hours of Thursday.

Mr. Faizal is probably the first LDF leader to be picked up by the investigating agencies in connection with the smuggling case that has shaken the State.

It was based on the statements of some of the accused in the case, including K.T. Rameez, that Mr. Faizal was taken into custody. However, his arrest has not been recorded. He was brought to the Kochi office of the Customs by afternoon.

Courting controversy

Mr. Faizal had hit the news in 2017 when Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, CPI(M) State secretary, travelled in his luxury car during the Jana Jagratha Yatra at Koduvally.

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence had named Mr. Faisal an accused in a case of smuggling 6 kg of gold through the Calicut international airport in 2013.

Mr. Faizal won from the Parambathu ward of Koduvally municipality as an Independent candidate with LDF backing in 2015.

With Mr. Faizal being taken into custody, it has become another embarrassment for the LDF government in the State. The Indian Union Muslim League and its feeder outfits and the Congress are already on the warpath against the CPI(M)-led government.

Koduvally has been in the news for being the hub of the gold smuggling in the State. The gold smuggled through the diplomatic channels at the Thiruvananthapuram airport had alleged found its way to Koduvally.

One more held

Meanwhile, the Customs arrested Mohamed Aslam of Wandoor in Malappuram in connection with the gold smuggling case.

It was based on the statement of Said Alavi, another accused in the case, that Aslam was arrested. Alavi had given a statement to the Customs that he and Aslam had colluded and smuggled 25 kg of gold through the diplomatic channel prior to the current case.

The duo smuggled gold during November and December 2019 and the market value of gold was estimated to be ₹9.61 crore. The arrested is suspected to have financed the gold smuggling, according to Customs officials.

With the arrest of Mr. Aslam, 17 persons have been arrested in the case. The investigating agencies are yet to arrest two more accused, who are abroad.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/customs-takes-karat-faizal-into-custody/article32743740.ece
165,2020/10/01,Campaign to select country’s national butterfly,"Seven winged beauties on the final list in poll conducted by nature lovers

A citizen campaign to drum up support for identifying a national butterfly has gained momentum with close to half a lakh people joining the movement from across the country.

Spearheaded by butterfly researchers, scientists and enthusiasts, the National Butterfly Campaign has revived focus on the relevance of the charming scaly winged insects in enhancing biodiversity. An indicator of healthy ecosystems, butterflies are found in wide varieties in biodiversity hotspots that teem with rich and diverse flora and fauna.

Vital link

Butterfly researchers also point out that these insects form a vital link in the food and life chain by becoming prey for birds and insects as well as through their role in pollination. The unique wing colour patterns and designs have also inspired various forms of art, fashion and culture. These insects among others are also known to anticipate environmental hazards, including pollution.

Kalesh Sadasivan, research associate, Travancore Nature History Society, pointed out that India was yet to designate a national butterfly despite being home to over 1,300 species belonging to six butterfly families that were primarily found in northeast India, Western Ghats and other mountainous and plateau regions. Several countries, including Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia and Bhutan, have national butterflies.

The contenders

As part of identifying butterfly species that could make it to the coveted status, the National Butterfly Campaign Consortium prepared a long-list of 50 butterflies that was further trimmed to seven.

Krishna Peacock (Papilio krishna), Indian Jezebel or Common Jezebel (Delias eucharis), Orange Oakleaf (Kallima inachus), Five-bar Swordtail (Graphium antiphates), Indian Nawab, Yellow Gorgon and Northern Junglequeen (Stichophthalma camadeva) are the contenders for the premier position.

A country-wide online poll that commenced on September 11 to identify the most-favoured butterfly species has currently generated 42,090 with Maharashtra recording the highest number of votes — 16,210. Several people have also cast their votes in West Bengal (3,029) and Karnataka (2,435), while 786 nature lovers from Kerala have also joined the campaign.

Cast your votes

The public poll, which can be accessed on https://forms.gle/u7WgCuuGSYC9AgLG6, will continue till October 8. A formal proposal with the top-ranking species will be submitted to the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1np116/article32747114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Indian-Jezebel,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/campaign-to-select-countrys-national-butterfly/article32743646.ece
166,2020/10/01,Reopening cinemas: Film Chamber plea for bailout package,"‘Present rate of entertainment tax and GST slabs on ticket collections unviable’

Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce on Thursday said that the reopening of cinemas would not be possible till the government declared a bailout package for the industry hit hard by the pandemic crisis.

Even though the Union government had permitted reopening cinema halls with 50% occupancy from October 15, the theatres in Kerala would not be able to resume operations with the present rate of entertainment tax and GST (Goods and Services Tax) slabs on ticket collections, it said.

K. Vijayakumar, president of the chamber, requested the government to issue a direction to the local bodies to stop collecting the entertainment tax on movie tickets. The present slab of 12% GST on tickets that cost less than ₹100 and 18% on tickets above ₹100 should also be reviewed in view of the financial uncertainties triggered by the COVID-19 crisis, he said.

Power bills

The Film chamber said that the Kerala State Electricity Board had imposed fixed power charges on theatre owners despite the cinema halls remaining closed for nearly 210 days since March. Mr. Vijayakumar said that the fixed charge was around ₹45,000 for a single-screen facility. The reopening of cinemas would incur additional expenses on the owners as an estimated ₹3 lakh to ₹4 lakh was required to carry out maintenance and cleaning work, he said.

The chamber representatives said that an economic bailout package was inevitable to save the industry from a major crisis. “Despite our repeated requests, the government has not yet responded to our demands,” they said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/reopening-cinemas-film-chamber-plea-for-bailout-package/article32743270.ece
167,2020/10/01,"Mullappally, Murali face-off over suspension of mass stir","‘Matter will be open for discussion at next PAC meeting’

Congress leader K. Muraleedharan, MP, on Thursday questioned the decision of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) to suspend mass agitations against the government, given the worrisome COVID-19 situation.

He said the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) was kept in the dark about the resolution. The settlement gave the impression that the Congress had developed cold feet and backed out of the fight. Top leaders were not consulted, and the decision appeared arbitrary.

Sources close to Mr. Muraleedharan said the leader seemed vexed that the decision-making process at the apex level of the KPCC often by-passed leaders such as him and was limited to a ""triumvirate"" at the top.

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said Mr. Muraleedharan's political shadowboxing would only serve to undermine the sense of unity and purpose in the party. Mr. Muraleedharan was sparring with imaginary opponents.

The KPCC decided to suspend mass agitations in consultation with Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy. The party felt that the assemblage of workers for protests could accelerate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. It had chosen public interest above everyday politics.

The KPCC had consulted an immediately available quorum of leaders to take the decision.

In the time of the pandemic, it was often difficult to have the PAC at hand to debate such matters. The decision was open to discussion at the next PAC meeting, he said.

Mr. Ramachandran said the AICC had cracked the whip on combative public statements and opinionated social media posts on organisational matters in January. None was above the rule. The KPCC president ruled out any disciplinary action against Mr. Muraleedharan, but said the AICC was aware of the issue.

Mr. Ramachandran said the Congress was poised to come to power in Kerala in 2021. It would sweep the local body polls in November. Leaders should be mindful that open bickering over organisational matters would dim the prospects of the party and the United Democratic Front (UDF).",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mullappally-murali-face-off-over-suspension-of-mass-stir/article32743139.ece
168,2020/10/01,Actors agree to pay cut,"Tovino Thomas, Joju George to re-draft agreements

Actors Tovino Thomas and Joju George have agreed to a pay cut in their new movies after the Kerala Film Producers Association (KFPA) stuck to its declared stance that artistes need to reduce their salary in view of the financial crisis induced by the pandemic.

The producers of the movies starring Mr. Thomas and Mr. George informed the project scrutiny committee of the KFPA on Thursday that the actors had agreed to reduce their pay. The agreement signed between the two artistes and their producers will be re-drafted after including the reduced fee.

Scrutiny committee

Siyad Kokker, convener of the scrutiny committee, said that the pay for Mr. Thomas mentioned in the agreement was ₹1 crore while the corresponding figure for Mr. George was ₹50 lakh. Mr. George had now agreed to reduce it to ₹30 lakh. Mr. Thomas said that he would complete the film without collecting any advance from his producer. The actor would take a share of the profit earned by the producer as his salary after the release, he said.

The producers’ association had earlier pointed out that a few actors had increased the fee for movies signed in the pandemic period despite repeated pleas to reduce it in view of the financial crisis faced by the producers. A newcomer, whose salary was ₹15 lakh for her last movie, increased it to ₹25 lakh for her latest assignment. The KFPA had sought the cooperation of the Film Employees Federation of Kerala for instructing film production executives not to encourage ventures in which the artistes were found demanding higher salaries.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/actors-agree-to-pay-cut/article32743088.ece
169,2020/10/01,Fans join hands to preserve legendary snakeboat,"Tourism dept. fails to set up a museum for legendary snakeboat Nadubhagam Chundan

It was in 1952 India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, during a visit to Alappuzha, hopped on Nadubhagam Chundan (snakeboat) after witnessing a snakeboat race.

Rest is history. On his return to New Delhi, Nehru donated a silver trophy, a replica of a snakeboat and paved way for the renowned Nehru Trophy Boat Race.

As time passed, the legendary snakeboat ceased competing in races and Nadubhagam Boat Club (NBC) retired in 2013. They replaced it with a brand new chundan with the same name. Since its retirement, the chundan has been kept in a crumbled shed, leaving a piece of history to decay. But not any more.

Although the Tourism Department's promise to set up a museum and shift the chundan there remains unfulfilled, the NBC, Nadubhagam Chundan Fans Club (NCFC) and local residents have now joined hands to preserve it. As part of protecting it, the chundan will be reconditioned under the guidance of craftsman Sabu Narayanan Achary, who built the new chundan a few years ago.

A new 'vallapura' (boathouse) will also be constructed at Nadubhagam.

The project is expected to cost an estimated ₹10 lakh. While the NCFC members will bear a major share of the cost, the rest will be raised from the public. ""The chundan has great historical significance. We waited for the government to preserve it, but it did not happen. We have taken ourselves the task of conserving it. With the active support of the public, we hope to complete the work in six months,"" said K.S. George, president, NBC.

The story of Nadubhagam Chundan dates back to the 1920s. In 1927, the people of Nadubhagam decided to compete in their own boat in the race at Champakulam. They bought a ‘palliyodam’ from Vembala in Aranmula.

Later, the villagers transformed it into a chundan. During Nehru’s visit, the chundan ferried him, his daughter Indira Gandhi and grandson Rajiv Gandhi to the Alappuzha boat jetty from Meenappally Kayal, following an exhibition race, in which it came first.

Since then, the boat race has been held every year. The trophy was initially named Prime Minister’s trophy but later came to be known as Nehru trophy. In 2019, Nadubhagam Chundan (new snakeboat), rowed by the Pallathuruthy Boat Club, repeated history by lifting the Nehru trophy for the first time since 1952.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fn24eo/article32742973.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2tval2--Nadubhagam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fans-join-hands-to-preserve-a-slice-of-history/article32742902.ece
170,2020/10/01,"Life Mission controversy: Let the CBI go ahead with the probe, says Kerala High Court","The court added orally that there were certain grey areas in the issue.

The Kerala High Court on Thursday orally observed that the investigation by the CBI into the alleged irregularities in the Life Mission Housing Project in Wadakkancherry, Thrissur could not be stopped.

Justice V.G. Arun made the observation when a petition, filed by Life Mission Chief Executive Officer U.V. Jose challenging the First Information Report (FIR) registered by the CBI in a court here, in connection with the alleged irregularities in the Life Mission Housing Project in Thrissur, came up for hearing.

The court also declined a plea by Senior Supreme Court lawyer K.V. Viswanathan appearing for the CEO, for an order restraining the CBI from taking any coercive steps against the CEO. He pointed out that the agency had issued a notice asking him to produce certain documents in connection with the project.

The court added orally that there were certain grey areas in the issue. ""Let the investigation go on"", the court said, even as it issued notice to CBI and others, and asked the LIFE Mission to cooperate with the probe.

The Chief Executive Officer in his petition contended that the CBI had registered the FIR with mala fide intention and the agency was guided by political and extraneous considerations. The FIR had alleged violation of section 3 of the Foreign Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. In fact, the Life Mission had not accepted any contribution, much less any foreign contributions. The contractual agreement for the construction of the buildings under the Life Mission was executed between the Consular General of United Arab Emirate and Unitac, a construction company. It was the sponsors which had selected Unitac and Sane Ventures, another construction company for carrying out the construction of the buildings under the project. Neither the State government nor Life Mission had any role in the section of contractors.

The petitioner pointed out that the construction companies which had inked agreements with Consulate General of United Arab Emirates did not come under any categories of persons prohibited from receiving any foreign contributions under Section 3 of the Act. The category of the persons included candidates for election, correspondent, columnist, cartoonist, editor, owner, printer or publisher of a registered newspaper, judges, government servants or employee of government controlled bodies, member of any legislature, political parties or companies engaged in the production or broadcast of audio news or audio visual news or current affairs programmes through any electronic mode etc.

The court adjourned the hearing on the petition to October 8.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sq65l6/article30926459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/lifemission,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/life-mission-controversy-let-the-cbi-go-ahead-with-the-probe-says-kerala-high-court/article32740974.ece
171,2020/10/01,Kerala kicks off ‘KSRTC Logistics’ for parcel service,"In a bid to enhance non-ticket revenue, the ailing Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has commenced “KSRTC Logistics” for parcel service.

The modified stage-carriers of the KSRTC will be used by the State transport undertaking for transporting official letters, parcels of government departments, public sector units, constitutional institutions and private entrepreneurs.

The logistics division has been set up to mobilise funds to overcome the fall in the revenue over the last six months due to the low patronage following the pandemic-induced lockdown and to meet the rising fuel bill and spare parts for the stage carriers in the fleet. The courier service launched earlier in KSRTC had failed to take off.

The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) has come forward to utilise the facility offered by the KSRTC. The shipping of the various commodities in the kits being provided to all ration card holders for the next four months in view of COVID-19 will be through KSRTC Logistics.

The Supplyco is hiring five buses from KSRTC for a monthly rent of ₹1.25 lakh. For every extra km used after the initial 2,500 km, the Supplyco has to pay an additional ₹50 per km to the KSRTC.

The KSRTC has plans to ferry question papers and answer sheets of the Kerala Public Service Commission, various universities and the Commissioner for Government Examinations with adequate security and GPS tracking of the vehicles carrying them. Talks are on with the PSC, various universities and Pareeksha Bhavan authorities in this regard, says the Managing Director Biju Prabhakar.

The Kerala Logistics can also carry the letters from the Government Secretariat to the High Court, District Collectorates and other offices in the State. Similarly, the lottery tickets of the Lottery Department can be shipped through the facility to the vendors and agents across the State.

Another proposal is to transport the medicines of the Kerala Medical Service Corporation to the hospitals and official letters of the Kudumbashree Mission and Department of Information and Public Relations to the district level units.

“The aim is to channelise the parcels of all departments through the facility and make the KSRTC Logistics the official parcel service of the Kerala government”, he said. The formal launch of the service will take place this month.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/530nfj/article32740240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ksrtc-logistics,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-kicks-off-ksrtc-logistics-for-parcel-service/article32740241.ece
172,2020/10/01,TCMC censures three doctors,"One from Thiruvananthapuram, and two in Kozhikode featured in advertisements

The Travancore-Cochin Medical Council (TCMC) has censured one doctor in Thiruvananthapuram and two in Kozhikode for allowing themselves to be featured in advertisements in the media in violation of the provisions of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette, and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.

The action follows a complaint filed by Campaign Against Pseudo Science Using Law and Ethics (CAPSULE) Kerala, a platform launched by the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad.

According to the TCMC orders issued on August 14, copies of which are available with The Hindu, a photo of the doctor attached to V Care Skin and Piles Centre, Kattakkada, Thiruvananthapuram, was carried along with an advertisement in a Malayalam newspaper on March 19, 2019, claiming that the clinic offered haemorrhoid symptoms treatment for the first time in Kerala.

The names of the two doctors attached to PVS Hospital, Kozhikode, were found in an advertisement offering treatment for varicose vein in the April 2019 issue of a popular health magazine.

Professional norms

Section 6.1. of the Indian Medical Council Regulations Act says that soliciting of patients directly or indirectly, by a physician, by a group of physicians, or by institutions or organisations is unethical.

“A physician shall not make use of him / her (or his / her name) as subject of any form or manner of advertising or publicity through any mode either alone or in conjunction with others which is of such a character as to invite attention to him or to his professional position, skill, qualification, achievements, attainments, specialities, appointments, associations, affiliations or honours and/or of such character as would ordinarily result in his self-aggrandizement,” it says.

Doctors’ stand

The doctor from Kattakkada claimed that the advertisement was placed without his knowledge. While one of the two doctors in Kozhikode pointed out that he had snapped ties with the hospital much before the advertisement was placed in the magazine, the other claimed that his consent was not taken before it was published.

The modern medicine ethics committee of the TCMC, however, pointed out that the doctors cannot wash their hands of the act of being featured in advertisements. Later, they tendered apologies and the TCMC censured them.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tcmc-censures-three-doctors/article32738355.ece
173,2020/10/01,Masjid order evokes disappointment,"Secular fabric destroyed, say parties

Muslim organisations, irrespective of religious and political affiliations, expressed their disappointment at the acquittal of all accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case by a special court in Lucknow on Wednesday.

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) demanded that the investigation agencies go in appeal against the verdict. “It’s unfortunate. It’s sad to see the people who committed such a serious crime going scot-free,” said IUML chairman and State president Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal. However, Mr. Thangal called upon the people to uphold communal harmony.

IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty, MP, said the verdict amounted to saying that the Babri Masjid was not demolished. “It is an unfortunate verdict in a crime committed 28 years ago. Justice is denied,” he said.

“It is extremely disappointing,” said Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama (AP group) president E. Sulaiman Musliar and general secretary Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliar.

‘Blow to democracy’

“It’s a twin blow to Indian democracy,” said Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama (EK group) president Syed Mohammed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal and general secretary K. Alikutty Musliar. The Samastha Kerala Sunni Mahallu Federation too described the verdict as unfortunate.

The Indian National League (INL) said the verdict challenged the people’s democratic conscience. The Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and the Fraternity Movement took out protest marches across the district.

CPI(M) reaction

CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the judgment had left secular and democratic forces anxious. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had saved the accused by failing to ferret out evidence and submit it in court. The outcome was illustrative of how the Centre used the CBI for its political ends.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the verdict was a strike at the secular foundations of the Indian Constitution. The Supreme Court had found that the destruction of the Babri Masjid was a criminal act. However, the CBI failed to furnish proof. Its conduct in the case was dubious.

BJP State president K. Surendran said the verdict had ended a three-decade-long witch-hunt of party leaders. The Congress had used the incident to tar and feather senior BJP leaders such as L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti. They have finally got justice, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/masjid-order-evokes-disappointment/article32738353.ece
174,2020/10/01,Coronavirus | Kerala’s COVID caseload doubled in September 2020,"In many districts, case graphs could peak in a few weeks

September has indeed been the cruellest month as far as Kerala and its COVID-19 case burden is concerned.

In September alone, Kerala recorded almost double the number of cases it had cumulatively registered till August 31.

Till August 31, the total number of COVID-19 cases registered in the State had been 75,385. The cumulative number of deaths reported till August 31 was 294.

In September, Kerala recorded 1,20,721 cases of COVID-19 and 448 deaths. This essentially means that over 60% of the State’s cumulative case burden as well as the burden of COVID deaths were recorded in just one month.

And the scariest part seems to be that since the disease spread is not uniform across districts, in many districts, the case graphs could be peaking only in the next few weeks, extending the State’s collective agony over the month or more.

However, public health experts point out that Kerala has held out till now and with a remarkably low case fatality rate only because the epidemic has been spread out over the months.

The disease containment interventions and the general vigil exercised by people – mask wearing being the most prominent, as Kerala was the first State to implement universal mask-wearing – have resulted in a lag in the progress of the epidemic.

This has helped the State because the patient numbers did not peak overnight and threaten the health system capacity.

Plateauing in capital?

The good news for Thiruvananthapuram district, which has recorded the highest number of new COVID-19 cases every day consistently for over two months, is that the case graph could be plateauing, while in other districts cases are all set to climb. The district still would be recording 800-900 cases daily but the statistics over the past few days have given rise to hopes that the worst might be over and that the case fatality rate might be contained at 1%.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/i0rwcj/article32738348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1-09-20-tvmp-bangali,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/states-covid-caseload-doubled-in-sept/article32738350.ece
175,2020/10/01,Meet to discuss widening of Gap Road stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway,"Resumption of works will figure at meeting

District Collector H. Dineshan has convened a meeting to discuss road-widening works on the Gap Road stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway on Friday. Resumption of works would figure at the meeting.

The works had been suspended after a major landslip on June 17. The landslip had caused large-scale damage to agricultural land on lower side of the road. It was alleged that unscientific works had caused a series of landslips, including the one on June 17.

The meeting will also discuss the compensation to the affected farmers, the Collector said.

The Devikulam Subcollector has submitted a report on the landslip, he said adding that a detailed report would also be given to the government.

An official of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said permission was received from the Ministry of Road Transport to resume road-widening works on the stretch. The works had been suspended considering the chances of landslips during the monsoon season.

He said the construction works of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway were expected to be completed before December and funds for construction of retaining walls in areas prone to landslips had been allotted.

A report by Devikulam Subcollector S. Premkrishnan to the Revenue Principal Secretary stated that road-widening works on the stretch should not have resumed in the present condition. The report also recommended an inquiry into the allegations of unscientific road works by the contractor.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/meet-to-discuss-widening-of-gap-road-stretch-of-the-kochi-dhanushkodi-national-highway/article32738270.ece

It’s A Wonderful Life

Frank Capra is one of my favourite directors. True to the title, it is the kind of film that spreads positivity and shows you how beautiful and gifted this life is. It’s a Wonderful Life is a movie I would like everybody to watch. It is the kind of film I would like to make, someday.

Breaking Bad

The only thing that is common for all filmmakers is Breaking Bad. It is a series that is always inspiring for us. There have been a lot of TV shows of late and the interest in them dies down when they prolong them. But that never happened with this....everything, every character is so perfect. Walter White is probably the most talked-about character in TV history.

Homeland

A CIA operative is on the hunt for an American prisoner. They have dealt with a lot of things from a female perspective and the first three seasons are extraordinary. The series explores the dynamics between the two — like The Silence of the Lambs — and touches upon multiple subjects like Stockholmn Syndrome. It also gave me an insight into the workings of the CIA.

17 Again

A nice, feel-good film that I caught recently.It may not be a popular one but it is like a sitcom. I found a lot of resemblance to this and my life, and I could connect to it. The movie is basically about looking back at your past, which was what Oh My Kadavule was also about.

Chekka Chivantha Vaanam

It somehow did not hit the right chord when I watched it in theatres. However, I revisited it later on an OTT platform and was awestruck by its storytelling. Today, having made my debut, when I watch the film from a director’s viewpoint, it gives a whole new perspective. What pulled me into Chekka Chivantha Vaanam was the way it is told and the internal politics that happens inside a gangster family.

177,2020/10/01,"Oscar Isaac, Jake Gyllenhaal to star in film about the making of ‘The Godfather’","Academy Award winner Barry Levinson will direct the film titled ‘Francis and The Godfather’

Hollywood stars Oscar Isaac and Jake Gyllenhaal are set to feature in a movie about the making of the celebrated crime drama “The Godfather.”

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the 1972 film was based on author Mario Puzo’s bestselling novel of the same name. The first movie, starring screen icon Marlon Brando in the titular role, spawned into a film series with two sequels, which released in 1974 and 1990.

“The Godfather” chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), from a doe-eyed family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Academy Award winner Barry Levinson will direct the film titled “Francis and The Godfather.”

While Isaac will play the role of Coppola, Gyllenhaal will portray former Paramount studio head Robert Evans.

The movie is based on a Black List script by Andrew Farotte that was redeveloped with Levinson.

“Francis and The Godfather” will chronicle the battles between Coppola, who was 31 at the time, and Evans, which included taking a gamble on casting Brando, who had not had a hit in years, and a then-little-known Pacino.

“Out of the madness of production, and against all odds, a classic film happened,” said Levinson.

Coppola added, “Any movie that Barry Levinson makes about anything, will be interesting and worthwhile!”

Echo Lake Entertainment’s Mike Marcus, Doug Mankoff and Andrew Spaulding are producing along with Kevin Turen, Jon Levin and Baltimore Pictures’ Jason Sosnoff.

Endeavor Content is handling worldwide rights with FilmNation.

“The Godfather” won the Oscars for best picture, best actor for Brando, and best adapted screenplay for Puzo and Coppola at the 45th Academy Awards.

Its 1974 sequel, “The Godfather II” drew parallels between tracing the origins of a young Vito (played by Robert De Niro) from Sicily to New York and the rise of Michael as head of the Corleone family.

The film won six Oscar, including best director for Coppola, best supporting actor for De Niro and best adapted screenplay for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won the best actor BAFTA and was nominated for the Academy Award for best actor.

Meanwhile, Coppola is working to restore and re-edit “The Godfather III” for a theatrical release later this year.

The final film in the trilogy, which chronicled the twilight years of Pacino’s Michael, also starred Diane Keaton, Andy Garcia, Talia Shire, and director’s daughter, Sofia Coppola, the director of films like “Lost in Translation”, “Marie Antoinette”, and the upcoming “On The Rocks“.

In the 1990 film, Keaton reprised her role of Kay Adams, who is now divorced from Michael.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ubppwh/article32741627.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILMFESTIVAL-VENICE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oscar-isaac-jake-gyllenhaal-to-star-in-film-about-the-making-of-the-godfather/article32741628.ece

180,2020/10/01,Chadwick Boseman’s last film ‘Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom’ to release in December on Netflix,"The period drama is an adaptation of August Wilson’s award-winning play of the same name

Period drama “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”, an adaptation of August Wilson’s award-winning play of the same name, is slated to be released on December 18, Netflix has announced.

The film also marks the last cinematic appearance of “Black Panther” star Chadwick Boseman, who passed away in August following a private, four year-long battle with colon cancer.

“Ma Rainey’s” stars Viola Davis in the title role, with Dusan Brown, Glynn Turman, Colman Domingo, and Michael Potts in key roles.

Actor-producer Denzel Washington is backing the film with Todd Black and Dany Wolf.

The streamer also dropped the first-look pictures from the movie directed by George C Wolfe on its official Twitter page.

“Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman star in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, a new film based on August Wilson’s award-winning play from director George C Wolfe and producer Denzel Washington. @MaRaineyFilm premieres December 18,” Netflix said in a tweet.

The film follows Ma Rainey, a famous blues singer as she makes a record in a studio in 1927 Chicago, where tension boils over among her, her white agent and bandmates.

Boseman played Ma’s boyfriend Levee, an ambitious trumpeter who aspired to make his own mark in the music industry.

The story explores the issues of race, art, religion and the exploitation of black recording artistes at the hands of white producers.

Following Boseman’s death, Netflix delayed a virtual preview that it had planned for the film.

Before “Black Panther”, Boseman, 43, made a name for himself by playing iconic black historical figures like baseball star Jackie Robinson in “42” (2013), singer-songwriter James Brown in “Get on Up” (2014) and the first African-American Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in “Marshall” (2017).

Recently, actor Sienna Miller, who co-starred with Boseman in the 2019 crime drama “21 Bridges”, revealed that the late actor “donated” a part of his salary to increase her fee when the studio didn’t agree to pay her the number she quoted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/733rpc/article32739680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EjMr2DdVgAI5KPu,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chadwick-bosemans-last-film-ma-raineys-black-bottom-to-release-in-december-on-netflix/article32739681.ece

What is a sin?

Four leading filmmakers of Tamil cinema are set to give us their perspective on it, in the form of an anthology film Paava Kadhaigal, dropping on Netflix later this month. Touted to be on a hard-hitting subject, the four storylines will explore how love, pride and honour influence complex relationships. It is helmed by Vetri Maaran, Gautham Menon, Sudha Kongara and Vignesh Shivan, and stars Prakash Raj, Sai Pallavi, Anjali, Simran, Kalidas, Kalki Koechlin and Shanthnu, among others.

While Netflix has actively been putting out anthologies in Bollywood, Paava Kadhaigal is their first such outing in Tamil cinema.The last decade has thrown up a few interesting anthologies in Kollywood, including Aviyal, Solo and Sillu Karupatti. But Paava Kadhaigal, produced by Ronnie Screwvala’s RSVP Movies and Ashi Dua Sara’s Flying Unicorn Entertainment, might be the biggest of them all, considering the names involved. Excerpts from a quick Zoom chat with the four acclaimed filmmakers:

Vetri Maaran

An anthology is a collective work in which you come together for a common idea, irrespective of whether you are like-minded or not. That itself is an experience. It is more than just being the take of a filmmaker on a topic; it is also an effective cinematic form where you share ideas and put forward content for discussion.

Paava Kadhaigal will showcase emotional moments of people in dire situations, and how their choices reflects the world they come from. That way, we question certain aspects of the society through these stories.

‘Freedom to explore’

Theatrical film has a certain kind of tradition where it usually revolves around one protagonist, ideally a younger person. You don't have the freedom to tell a story of a 84-year-old woman or a three-year-old child. Even if you make a Baby’s Day Out, you need to make it in the adult world, meaning that the little child has to win over several people so that the masses come in. In OTT, when you are making a film outside theatrical compulsions, there is freedom to explore on the content. There is also a big burden taken off my shoulders about how other people, be it my producer or editor, would respond to it. I think working on these projects will help a filmmaker find his real voice; in a theatrical film, only a shade of you can be seen in some of the films.

Gautham Menon

The idea of the anthology is to have an aspect of sin in all stories, and also talk about relationships in families. It is about what happens when something goes wrong, and how someone handles a situation in which you want to disown someone, who is your kith and kin. It all falls under the common theme: ‘sin stories’. It makes for intense viewing and aimed at leaving an impact. The films do have humour, comedy and emotion, but it will have gut-wrenching moments.

Acting v/s direction

I have acted in my portion, but I generally don’t like doing it. As an actor, I completely go with the director and the crew; I took up Malayalam film Trance because of its filmmakers and Fahadh Faasil, who I am a big fan of. If one of these three (Vetrimaaran, Vignesh and Sudha) call me for a part, I will surely go. But directing myself was not too easy. I also did it because two actors who were supposed to do it initially backed out. So, at the last minute, I decided to do it myself. I had to check that out with Simran, who was playing the female part, because she kept asking who was going to play that. I have great respect for her, and she led from the front. If you watch the film, you will know who directed whom.

Working for OTT platforms...

It was very liberating. I made Queen, which had five episodes of great content, sometime back. The way we worked on it was interesting, not being worried about aspects like timing of a particular shot, and what should come in the tenth minute and all that. Since I had already done that, I eased into Paava Kadhaigal. For me, it is not about how long your work is — whether it is ten minutes or half hour — you put your all. Even my short, Karthik Dial Seytha Enn, was done because I was passionate about that thirteen minutes of writing. So, when this idea of being in a film with three other contemporary filmmakers whose work I admire and respect, I got into it gung-ho.

Comparison with peers

Isn’t it beautiful that all our films will follow each other in one comprehensive work, within the space of minutes? If I saw these four names, I would myself probably pick Vetri’s film to watch first, but I am happy to be in that space.

Vignesh Shivan

Space for individuality

Initially, the give and take between us four was only to decide the topic. Once that was decided, we never knew what the other person was going to do, or the casting. After the films got completed, we interacted with each other; and that really helped. Not knowing what the other person was doing helped; we had the space to decide what we want without the influence of other one.

OTT versus theatre films

In a theatrical experience, creating a moment is somewhat easy; you can have a callback to a previous film, and if 10 people laugh, the others in the hall usually join in. When you create for OTT, you are solely dependent on your content; we have no clue how the audiences are watching it, and with whom. The two are different formats, and both enjoyable in their own way.

Sudha Kongara

Four voices, one story

I was busy with another feature when this came up, but the biggest reason I took it up was because it was fantastic to team up with these three names. I have been a huge fan of Gautham; I remember him editing Kaakha Kaakha and I used to pray for it to become a superhit. I adore Vetri’s work since Polladhavan; I have even called him in the middle of the night to tell him what an amazing film he has made. And, I enjoyed Vignesh’s Naanum Rowdy Than a lot. So, when you are working with these three guys, you have to up your game and that was a big challenge. What is most exciting is that there are four different voices to say the same kind of story.

Honest approach

I wrote Paava Kadhaigal the same way I wrote my feature films Irudhi Sutru or Soorarai Potru. I was more honest in this film rather, because you can afford to be real and get away with it.

Who’s acting?

I would not like to reveal my portion’s plot but Kalidas and Shanthanu have done excellent parts. Kali was to initially star in Shanthanu’s part, but things changed because I could not find anyone for the role. However, once the casting and reading happened, I could not imagine this project with anyone else.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/292qsw/article32739545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201001-WA0001,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/paava-kadhaigal-interview-how-vetri-maaran-gautham-menon-vignesh-shivan-and-sudha-kongara-joined-the-netflix-anthology/article32739556.ece

183,2020/10/01,TNRERA rejects plea that only residential association can resolve dispute with builder,"‘As per Section 31(1) of the RERA Act, any aggrieved person may file a complaint for any violation or contravention of the provisions of the Act’

Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TNRERA) has rejected plea that individual home buyers do not have locus standi to file complaint against the developer, after forming an association, which can only resolve the disputes with the promoter.

In his complaint, K. Balasubramaniyan said he along with his wife had jointly purchased an apartment in the project 'Tulive Viha' in Anna Nagar East from G.K.S. Technology Park Pvt. Ltd in 2019. He objected to sale of part of the alleged common area to two other home buyers Devendra Bhatia and Anjula Bhatia.

The complaint named the builder and the other home buyers as respondents. Devendra Bhatia and Anjula Bhatia challenged the maintainability of the complaint on the grounds that he has no locus standi since the Association of the allottees (Tulive Viha Apartment Owners Association) has already been formed and it was the association which has to resolve the disputes with the promoter.

The TNRERA rejected the plea noting that they have misconstrued the explanation to Section 31(1) of the RERA Act. As per the section, any aggrieved person may file a complaint for any violation or contravention of the provisions of the Act, it said. The definition of person includes the Association of Allottees in addition to the individual allottees, it clarified.

It also reiterated that once the Act wasin place, recourse could be taken through arbitration and rejected the plea on that ground as well and ruled that the complaint was maintainable.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tnrera-rejects-plea-that-only-residential-association-can-resolve-dispute-with-builder/article32742804.ece
184,2020/10/01,"In Vellore, two young men launch organisation to promote organic produce","The organisation, EPPO, collects produce from farmers and sells its to residents at their doorsteps, via e-vehicles

In a move to help organic farmers and to promote healthy eating, two youngsters have started an organisation, ‘EPPO’, to purchase organic produce from farmers at their farms and sell them to residents of Vellore and Ranipet districts in e-vehicles.

The youngsters, B. Arun Kishore and P. Karthikeyan, have tied up with the Certified Organic Farmers Association to provide free training to farmers and convert them to organic methods of agriculture from conventional farming methods, which use chemical fertilizers.

Every morning members of EPPO procure the products from the farmers at their respective farms and distribute them at the doorsteps of the people using two e-vehicles. “Each vehicle has 22 racks with packed organic vegetables. The vehicles go through the streets of Vellore and Ranipet playing audio announcements about the benefits of such produce,” said Mr. Arun Kishore.

He said that people have been consuming chemicals in the name of vegetables. “The organic farmers, on the other hand, are unaware about marketing strategies. Hence we directly procure vegetables from the farmers at a price that brings them profit, grade them and sell the good quality produce to the residents,” said G.S. Purushoththaman, director, Organic Farming Organisation and president of the Certified Organic Farmers Association.

He said that across Tamil Nadu, there are one lakh organic farmers and around 10,000 in Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Tirupathur and Ranipet. “The government of India has authorized the Organic farming Organisation Vellore as the Regional Council for Participatory Guarantee System to certify the organic products produced by the farmers since 2011,” he said.

Arun Kishore said that farmers do not have time to come to the towns and sell their products. “We sell them to the public and the amount is used to pay our staff and maintain the e-vehicles. We are trying to introduce this system in Chennai too,” he added.

“Earlier, we were not able to sell the produce daily. We used to sell the produce once a week and sometimes send it to Chennai. These youngsters are purchasing it daily from us and we are able to earn a good income,” said M.

The Tamil Nadu Government All Department Association’s Coordination Committee has asked the State government to clarify its order on government offices functioning with 100% employees, as the 6-day--week pattern is continuing due to lack of clarity as per the order issued earlier.

Demanding the restoration of the 5-day-week working pattern, its members staged a demonstration across Virudhunagar district on Thursday.

The Committee’s coordinator, Kannan, said that under the COVID-19 lockdown conditions, the State had ordered government offices to function with 50% staff. Consequently, it increased the number of working days to six days a week.

However, after a series of relaxations for the lockdown were given, the government ordered 100% employees to return to work. But there is no clarity on continuing with the 6-day-week working pattern, he said.

“The State government had, in the past, reduced the number of working days to five days a week in order to save fuel and electricity expenses. Consequently, the working hours were increased and lunch time was reduced. Besides, the number of casual leave was reduced from 20 days a year to 12 days a year,” he noted.

Pre-commissioning checks of the overhead electrical equipment were currently underway in full swing along the stretch.

The Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur section via Kumbakonam is the final leg of the railway electrification project executed on the 228 km mainline section from Villupuram Junction to Thanjavur Junction via Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Mayiladuthurai and Kumbakonam which comes under the vast jurisdiction of the Tiruchi railway division.

The overhead electrification project on the mainline section was entrusted to the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Government of India enterprise under the Ministry of Railway.

The stretch from Villupuram to Mayiladuthurai were already energised and commissioned in phases and mandatory clearances obtained from the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru earlier for operation of electric loco hauled passenger and freight trains on that portion.

A senior RVNL official told The Hindu that works connected with overhead electrification have been completed on the Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur broad gauge stretch and pre-commissioning checks were currently in progress by deploying a tower wagon. The stretch would soon be ready for commissioning, the official said.

The Southern Railway administration would be submitting relevant documents pertaining to completion of overhead electrification works on the Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur portion to the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru to invite the him for mandatory inspection.

Ahead of the inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety, a trial run of an electric loco was expected to be conducted.

Only after inspection and obtaining statutory clearance from the Commissioner of Railway Safety, could electric loco hauled passenger trains be operated on the Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur stretch.

Once the Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur portion gets commissioned, the entire mainline section would become a fully electrified stretch paving the way for the operation of electric loco hauled passenger trains from Villupuram to Thanjavur and from thereon up to Tiruchi Junction.

According to an NLCIL official, TPS-I was set up following the discovery of lignite deposits in Neyveli in Cuddalore district in 1962. The Unit I was dedicated to the nation on August 5, 1962 by former President Dr. S. Radhakrishnan.

“TPS-I with 600 MW, the epitome of Indo-Soviet collaboration had nine units including six units of 50 MW each and three units of 100 MW each. The plant was set up between 1962 and 1970 in three stages with an initial capital of ₹77.81 crore,” he said.

The unit I was synchronised with the grid on May 23, 1962 while the last unit was synchronised with the grid on February 21, 1970. Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) was the sole beneficiary of the plant, the official said.

Consequent to the declaring of Commercial Operation of Unit I of Neyveli New Thermal Power Station (NNTPS), the replacement plant, NLCIL had scheduled to decommission the Units of TPS-I in phases from March to September 2020.

It will be implemented in Madurai, Ramanathapuram, Thanjavur, Thoothukudi, Tiruvannamalai and Virudhunagar districts from October 16.

Under this scheme, families having Priority Household (PHH) ration cards and Antodaya Anna Yojana (PHH-AAY) ration cards from Tamil Nadu, while migrating to other States, can receive their monthly entitlements through biometric authentication under the National Food Security Act, 2013, an official release said.

Likewise, families migrating to Tamil Nadu from other States with these cards can receive their entitlements at the Central-issue price at the shops near their residence after biometric authentication.

“If the ration cardholders from Tamil Nadu could not complete biometric authentication, they can use their smart cards and receive an OTP in their Aadhaar-linked mobile phone and the existing system of using Aadhaar and scanned ration cards to receive their monthly entitlements,” the release said.

The elderly and those with illnesses who cannot go to receive their monthly entitlements can nominate a person to receive them.

After computerising the public distribution system operations in the State at a cost of ₹330 crore, the Tamil Nadu government has been distributing essential items to beneficiaries with smart cards since April 1, 2017.

Under the Centre’s Integrated Management of Public Distribution System, efforts were made to provide essential items even to families that migrate to Tamil Nadu from other States.

193,2020/10/01,"COVID-19 data from T.N., A.P. may provide insights for low-resource regions","Researchers use surveillance, contact-tracing data to study transmission, epidemiology

A paper published in the journal Science on Wednesday has used data from two Indian States, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, to provide key insights into the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in resource-limited populations.

It used surveillance and contact tracing data, which are critical components of an effective public health response to COVID-19, from these two States, to generate observations that might also work in other similar low- and middle-income settings.

The authors of the paper, titled ‘Epidemiology and Transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in two Indian states’, include the Health Secretaries of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, J. Radhakrishnan and K.S. Jawahar Reddy, Ramanan Laxminarayan of Center for Disease Dynamics, Delhi, and researchers from Princeton Environmental Institute and Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley.

Much of the information about COVID-19 so far has been from China, Europe and the United States (U.S.). “Although most COVID-19 cases have occurred in low-resource countries, little is known about the epidemiology of the disease in such contexts. Data from the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh provide a detailed view into SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways and mortality in a high-incidence setting,” the paper stated.

Both States recorded their first laboratory-confirmed case on March 5 and are among those with the largest healthcare workforces and public health expenditures per capita. They are known for their effective primary healthcare delivery models and initiated rigorous disease surveillance and contact tracing early in response to the pandemic, the researchers stated.

“Our analysis suggests substantial variation in individuals’ likelihood of transmitting: no secondary infections were linked to 71% of cases whose contacts were traced and tested,” the paper added. It also identified high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of cases around their own age. School closures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions during the study period may have contributed to the reductions in contact among children.

The analyses of fatal outcomes revealed an overall case-fatality ratio of 2.1%. They averred that a lower relative incidence of COVID-19 among older adults in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh has contributed to stark differences in the overall case fatality ratio and age distribution of decedents, in comparison to observations in the United States and other high-income countries.

Prospective testing of a large sample of exposed individuals through integrated active surveillance and public health interventions provided an opportunity to characterise secondary attack rates, identify risk factors for transmission, and account for deaths outside of healthcare settings, the paper added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-data-from-tn-ap-may-provide-insights-for-low-resource-regions/article32735990.ece

197,2020/10/01,AIADMK seeks White Paper on CM’s fund,"Details of funds received from the Centre should be made public, says party

The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has demanded a White Paper on the amount received towards the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.

In a statement on Wednesday, AIADMK leader A. Anbalagan said there was no clarity on the amount received and money utilised from the fund for COVID-19 related works.

The government should also make public the funds received from the Centre and the expenses incurred to procure medicine and medical equipment in the fight against the pandemic.

Expenses incurred for providing free food to patients admitted in hospitals should also be made public, he said.

Urging the Chief Minister and the Lt. Governor to work in unison to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus in the Union Territory, the AIADMK leader said it would not augur well if both continued to work in different directions.

The government could constitute a committee, comprising Ministers to interact with the Lt. Governor to coordinate COVID-19 relief measures, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-seeks-white-paper-on-cms-fund/article32737065.ece
198,2020/10/01,More number of High Court judges opt for physical hearing from October 5,"13 judges to hold proceedings only via video conference

More number of judges of the Madras High Court have decided to go in for physical hearing of cases from October 5 despite a majority of lawyers having opted to conduct their cases only through virtual courts ever since six Division Benches of the court alone began hearing cases since September 5.

The Madras High Court has a working strength of 54 judges, including its Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, as against its sanctioned strength of 75. Of them, 15 have been assigned to the Madurai Bench for a period of three months beginning from October 5. The rest of the 39 judges would continue to serve at the principal seat in Chennai.

Early this month, six Division Benches of the High Court began hearing cases through both physical and virtual modes by alternating them in the forenoon and afternoon sessions. Advocates were given the option of choosing to argue their cases either before the physical or virtual court and surprisingly a majority of them chose to conduct cases through video conference.

Safety concerns

The number of cases listed for physical hearing was very thin compared to those listed before virtual courts. Though the judges attempted to persuade the counsel to agree for physical hearing, it was found difficult to convince all the counsel representing different parties since they feared COVID-19 and found it safe to argue cases through the virtual mode.

After experimenting with the conduct of physical hearing through Division Benches, the High Court wanted to know how many more judges were interested in conducting physical hearing from October 5 and found that 26 of the 39 judges in the principal seat were agreeable to it and 13 of them opted to hold proceedings only through video conference.

Hence, it was decided that apart from the six Division Benches, 14 single judges would also hear cases through both physical and virtual modes from Monday. The cases would be listed before the physical court only if all lawyers, representing different parties in every case, were agreeable to it. Other cases would be listed for hearing virtually.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ak635g/article32737044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/more-number-of-high-court-judges-opt-for-physical-hearing-from-october-5/article32737045.ece
199,2020/10/01,PIL against banning of ornaments in NEET centres,"Women forced to remove their ‘thalis’ too, says petitioner

A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the National Testing Agency (NTA) to remove ornaments from the list of items barred at the centres where National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for medical and dental admissions are conducted every year.

Advocate S. Arvind Raj filed the PIL petition on the ground that a ban on ornaments and metallic items had led to many women being asked even to remove their sacred ‘thali’ before being allowed to enter the examination centres.

He said such an insistence went against religious customs, and subjected the candidates to mental agony.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pil-against-banning-of-ornaments-in-neet-centres/article32737036.ece
200,2020/10/01,‘T.N. decision cancelling arrear exams not right’,"G.O. declaring all students as passed without an assessment is against Act: AICTE

The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has told the Madras High Court that an order issued by the State government on August 26, cancelling the arrear examinations for all arts and science, engineering and MCA students except those pursuing the final year of their course, was not in accordance with its guidelines.

In a counter-affidavit filed in response to a public interest litigation petition preferred by professor and former vice-chancellor of Anna University E. Balagurusamy, the AICTE said, “The Government Order declaring all the students as passed without an assessment by way of examination is against the AICTE Act.”

The counter, served on the litigant’s counsel, E. Vijay Anand, went on to state that the AICTE is a statutory body which has to lay down norms and standards for technical courses, curricula and physical as well as instructional facilities. It also prescribes the staff pattern, their qualifications and the assessment pattern for students.

“A degree cannot be awarded to a student who has failed in a large number of courses. This is not acceptable to industry too.

‘Against guidelines’

“In view of the said G.O., all students, even those who have paid fees for arrear examinations, have been declared as passed, which is totally against the guidelines,” read the counter-affidavit signed by M. Sundaresan, southern regional officer of AICTE, on behalf of the council.

In his affidavit, Mr. Balagurusamy stated that he had chosen to file the PIL petition to save the quality of education, the future of students and the reputation of universities.

He said the government’s decision had demoralised meritorious students who had cleared all papers without any arrears.

“The G.O. will definitely lower the educational standards of students and universities…Several students have approached me and expressed apprehensions about future prospects, and [have] further informed [me] that most of the students have more than 25 arrear papers and less than 25% of marks in most of the subjects,” Mr. Balagurusamy said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-decision-cancelling-arrear-exams-not-right/article32736947.ece
201,2020/10/01,Over 93% Anna varsity students take tests online,"University’s four depts. see over 98% attendance for end-semester exams

Over 93% students from affiliated colleges and 98% students from the four University departments took the end-semester exams online.

The exams were held after much debate and trepidation about students lacking technical prowess, required gadgets and equipment to take the tests.

The University Grants Commission and the All-India Council of Technical Education had stipulated that end-semester examinations must be held for students in the final year.

The State government had issued several orders ruling out exams for students.

Another chance

Among the issues students faced was an inability to connect after logging in and not being able to complete the exam. The exams for final-year students, numbering 1.51 lakh, were held from September 24 to 29. During this time, of the 4,19,214 exams held, 3,91,379 were “successfully completed”, said M. Venkatesan, controller of examinations.

Meanwhile, 10,574 students who logged in, failed to connect, and 17,261 were absent, he added. “We have already written to the government, saying that they must be given an opportunity to write the exams again. Once we receive the order, we will provide a timetable and they will be able to write the exams,” he said.

S. Sanjeevi, the additional controller of examinations, who is in-charge of the four university campuses, said that “on one day, the attendance was 98.3% and on another 99%”.

University exam officials said they were collating information about malpractices the students had committed during the exams. “We are getting details from the colleges and will know by tomorrow,” Mr. Venkatesan said. The university has issued instructions about how the students should conduct themselves during the online test. Any deviation from the rule will be construed as malpractice, he said.

“We have accomplished it in the best possible way. It is for the first time in the country that online exams have been held for over 1.5 lakh students. Our exams were unlike JEE, where students have to come to a centre,” pointed out university vice-chancellor M.K. Surappa.

According to him, around 5% students could not take the test. “We will give them a chance to write the exams. When technology is available and leadership is there, we have to take a stand. It is better for academicians to decide on the conduct of exams and there should be no interference. When more autonomy and freedom is given to universities, they will perform better,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dj6z6e/article32736941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1THANNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/over-93-anna-varsity-students-take-tests-online/article32736942.ece
202,2020/10/01,CM launches solid waste management project in 7 zones,"Private firm given contract to cover 86 divisions for eight years at a cost of ₹447 crore per year; it will install over 8,800 garbage bins

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday launched a solid waste management project to be carried out by Urbaser SA and Sumeet Facilities in seven zones of the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC).

During the occasion, he flagged off vehicles that would be used for cleaning the streets, collecting waste from houses, segregating solid waste and depositing the waste in dumpyards.

In a press release, the GCC said the private player would undertake solid waste management in Teynampet, Kodambakkam, Valasaravakkam, Alandur, Adyar, Perungudi and Sholinganallur zones.

Urbaser SA and Sumeet Facilities bagged the contract for waste management in the seven zones, containing 86 divisions, for eight years at a cost of ₹447 crore per year.

The private agency would deploy 92 compactors, 21 mechanical sweepers and 1,931 e-rickshaws for door-to-door household waste collection.

To facilitate the process, over 8,870 garbage bins would be installed in various streets, and a total of 6,274 workers would be involved in cleaning operations in the seven zones.

The Greater Chennai Corporation has gone for privatisation of the solid waste management project by clearing bills through the Performance Based Cost of Delivery Model, against the normal practice of paying bills based on the quantity of waste removed.

The civic body has appointed third-party advisers to monitor the work, and would also keep tabs on the various waste segregation works that have been specified in the key performance indicators.

Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani and Minister for Personnel and Administrative Reforms D. Jayakumar participated in Wednesday’s event.

Prakash, took part in the inaugural event on Island Grounds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xhnqve/article32736893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cm-launches-solid-waste-management-project-in-7-zones/article32736896.ece

204,2020/10/01,"Rama Gopalan, Hindu Munnani founder, passes away at 94","He had tested positive for COVID-19; CM, other leaders extend condolences

Hindu Munnani founder Rama Gopalan, who had tested positive for COVID-19, died on Wednesday evening at a private hospital in Chennai. He was 94.

Born in 1927 at Sirkazhi, Mr. Gopalan joined the RSS in 1945. He founded the Hindu Munnani in 1980 under the guidance of the RSS.

Following the Meenakshipuram conversions in February 1981, in which around 200 Dalit families of the village converted to Islam as caste Hindus practiced untouchability, he tried to rally Hindus and prevent such conversions.

Protecting the religion

He had said that Hindu Munnani was formed to protect the religion from attacks by Islam, Christianity, Communism and those claiming to be rationalists.

He had also said that Hindus practicing untouchability and caste discrimination were causing damage to the religion.

In 1984, he escaped a bid on his life at the Madurai railway station. He was among those instrumental in turning immersion processions of Vinayaka idols into a public event in the last 30 years. Earlier, the tradition was to celebrate Vinayaka Chaturthi at houses and temples.

In an interview in 2015 with The Hindu Group’s Frontline magazine, Mr. Gopalan hit out at Dravidian parties and the Communists. “Who says Tamil Nadu is a State of secularism? It is anti-Hindu. These acts of double standards and deceit are for vote-bank politics, which has corrupted the system,” Mr. Gopalan had said.

Hindu Munnani State president Kadeswara C. Subramaniam said the organisation’s flags would be flown at half-mast across the State, and condolence meetings would be organised.

Governor Banwarilal Purohit, in a condolence message, said, “Fondly known as Veera Thuravi, he dedicated his entire life for the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu.”

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami also condoled Mr. Gopalan’s death.

In a statement, Mr. Palaniswami said Mr. Gopalan had taken part in the freedom struggle and was a guide to Hindu Munnani. He also extended his condolences to members of the movement.

DMK president M.K. Stalin, in a tweet, said: “Although there were ideological differences, he was a good friend of Kalaignar [former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi]”.

Dravidar Kazhagam leader K. Veeramani recalled that despite ideological differences, Mr. Gopalan and he would exchange pleasantries and enquire about each other’s well-being whenever they met.

‘A big loss’

Terming his death a big loss for the Hindus of Tamil Nadu, BJP State president L. Murugan said Mr. Gopalan fought to bring unity among Hindus, and fought against religious conversions and injustice meted out to Hindus. He had also raised his voice against cow slaughter.

Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, PMK founder S. Ramadoss, DMDK founder Vijayakant, AMMK leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran and former Health Minister H.V. Hande were among those who expressed condolences.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/c9hpdb/article11174626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ramagopalan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rama-gopalan-hindu-munnani-founder-passes-away-at-94/article32736857.ece
205,2020/10/01,Acquittal of Babri case accused a shame on rule of law: Stalin,"Opposition leaders express disappointment over the judgment

Leaders of Opposition parties on Wednesday expressed disappointment over the acquittal by a CBI court of all accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case. DMK president M.K. Stalin described it as “a shame on the rule of law”.

In a statement, Mr. Stalin said that even after the Supreme Court ruled that “the entire structure of the mosque was brought down in a calculated act of destroying a place of public worship,” the CBI had failed to prove the conspiracy.

He said it was not a question of mosques; encroachment upon and destruction of a place of worship of any religion amounted to an act of illegality and injustice. “Since the demolition of the mosque brought down India’s image in the international arena, the CBI should have acted with fairness and utmost care. It lost track and became the caged-bird of the BJP. It is a shame,” he said.

Mr. Stalin said that since the case caused a crisis to the Constitution, the CBI’s careless attitude would have severe consequences for justice.

TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said the verdict had shocked those who believed in the rule of law and governance. He appealed to the Centre to file an appeal. “The Sangh Parivar groups, including the BJP, mobilised thousands of people and destroyed the Babri Masjid in 1992. But Central investigating agencies did not gather enough evidence to prove the charges. This has raised serious doubts whether it [the CBI] has become a puppet in the hands of the BJP,” he said.

MDMK founder Vaiko said the demolition of Babri Masjid was in the works for years and ‘kar sevaks’ were prepared over months. “The mosque was demolished in daylight with the police and the Army watching. This was well-planned. Even the Supreme Court had said this was a ‘planned’ incident. The CBI court verdict that this was not a planned incident is akin to demolishing judicial response,” he said.

The CPI(M) State committee said the verdict amounted to a travesty of justice. “It took 28 long years for this verdict, but not for justice to be delivered. This verdict will blemish the image of India as a secular-democratic country governed by the Constitution. The CBI must immediately appeal against this judgment,” it said.

‘Final nail in the coffin’

Manithaneya Makkal Katchi founder M.H. Jawahirullah felt the verdict was the final nail in the coffin of India’s judicial system.

“It is the need of the hour to protest for an India that Mahatma Gandhi wished to create,” said Mr. Jawahirullah, inviting public participation in a protest to save India’s judiciary on October 1.

VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said, “Everybody knew that L.K. Advani went on a ‘Rath Yatra’ throughout India to mobilise people for a congregation on December 6, 1992, in Ayodhya, to demolish Babri Masjid and encouraged people to bring one brick each to build a Ram temple in its place.”

“If people lose trust in the courts, they will lose trust in democratic principles too. It will disturb the peace in the country,” he said, calling upon the Centre to file an appeal.

MNM founder Kamal Haasan said the faith of every Indian that he would get justice should not be in vain. He wondered whether the failure to provide undeniable evidence and strong arguments was a planned act or a sign of irresponsibility.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7nwj6t/article32736844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1THSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/acquittal-of-babri-case-accused-a-shame-on-rule-of-law-stalin/article32736845.ece

207,2020/10/01,Quick reporting of online fraud ensures recovery of funds: police,"Cyber crime cells are functioning in city’s 12 police districts

Cyber crime cells are helping victims in a big way in recovering stolen money, especially since most crimes are being reported within 24 hours of their occurrence.

Sanyasi Rao, 51, of Ambattur lost ₹39,000 to an unknown online fraudster when he was searching for a customer care number. He immediately lodged a complaint with the Ambattur cyber crime cell, who traced the money trail and spoke to the bank and the payment gateway. The funds were retrieved in a day.

Selvaraj, a businessman from Washermenpet, received an SMS informing him about fraudulent transactions from his account at an Australian bank. The cyber crime cell of the Washermanpet police traced the transaction to Melbourne and contacted the bank, who used the chargeback option to credit the amount back in Mr. Selvaraj’s account within a day.

Francis Anthony Beniger, a businessman, complained to the cyber crime cell of Adyar that an unknown person had cloned his international debit card and purchased some products in Brooklyn, U.S.

He received an SMS charging him $600 (₹46,000) for the fraudulent purchases. The cyber cell immediately got in touch with his bank and the transaction was blocked. The following day, Mr. Beniger received a full refund.

“On any complaint, we are able to initiate chargeback on OTP or any other financial frauds. We can stop the payment if the victim lodges a complaint within 24 hours. Our success depends on their awareness,” said a senior police officer who supervises cyber crime cells.

Cyber crime cells, inaugurated by Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, are functioning in the city’s 12 police districts since August 1. A cell comprises of four to six police personnel, led by a sub-inspector with expertise in cyber crimes. Deputy Commissioners of Police directly supervise the operations.

According to the police, the cells have received 1,010 complaints so far. Over 143 complaints were solved and investigations into 460 of them are nearing completion. About ₹30 lakh have been retrieved from culprits. The cells handle complaints on cyber stalking, harassment on social media, posts containing obscene and pornographic material and bank frauds.

The cells have also been entrusted with the job of tracing stolen or missing mobile phones.

A senior police officer said, “All complaints on missing phones and theft of mobile phones have been forwarded to cyber crime cells. Using IMEI numbers, the phones are traced and recovered. Over 1,200 mobile phones have been retrieved and handed over to the original owners.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/quick-reporting-of-online-fraud-ensures-recovery-of-funds-police/article32736767.ece
208,2020/10/01,AIADMK backs Palaniswami as CM candidate: Minister,"Internal matters will be settled amicably: Srinivasan

Forests Minister Dindigul C. Srinivasan, who is a senior AIADMK leader, on Wednesday said the party backed Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its face for the 2021 Assembly election.

Asked about the confusion over the party’s Chief Ministerial candidate, Mr. Srinivasan said the party backed Mr. Palaniswami. “Mediapersons should wait till October 7, when both the leaders [Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam] will jointly announce the candidate,” he added.

He described the “tussle” between Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam at the party’s recent executive council meeting as an internal affair. The AIADMK, he felt, would win hands down in the next elections. On Mr. Panneerselvam’s absence from an official meeting chaired by the Chief Minister, he said the latter was fully aware of the Deputy CM’s engagements that day. “There is no issue within the party, and internal matters will be settled amicably,” he said.

Meanwhile, two Ministers came up with different versions on why Mr. Panneerselvam did not attend the meeting.

Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar on Wednesday said the pre-occupation of Mr. Panneerselvam, who is also the AIADMK coordinator, with party work was the reason for his absence at the meeting on Tuesday. Just as Mr. Panneerselvam was busy with party work, Mr. Palaniswami was looking after the affairs of the government, Mr. Jayakumar told reporters at his residence in Foreshore Estate, Chennai. As for the omission of the Deputy CM’s name from the invitation to an event concerning the Greater Chennai Corporation, the Minister said no motive should be attributed to it. He said, “Going by precedents, the name of the Hon’ble Deputy CM is carried only in respect of invitations for prominent functions organised in Chennai, but this event relates to some wards of the city.”

[However, on another invitation for the same event which did rounds on social media, Mr. Panneerselvam’s name was mentioned].

Separately, Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar, who met the Deputy CM on Tuesday, said as Mr. Panneerselvam was not feeling well, he could not make it to the meeting. “This was why I had gone to his place to meet him,” he said. As the message regarding his disposition was conveyed to the Chief Minister, the latter went ahead with the meeting.

Amid the leadership tussle, Palladam MLA Karaipudur A. Natarajan on Wednesday endorsed Mr. Palaniswami as the Chief Ministerial candidate for the upcoming polls.

After meeting Mr. Panneerselvam along with Minister K. Pandiarajan later in the day, former Villivakkam legislator J.C.D. Prabhakar termed as wrong the observations of Mr. Srinivasan on the AIADMK’s CM candidate.

Describing the Forests Minister as a “senior member who knows the history of the party”, he referred to a call jointly issued by Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam to members of the party in August, urging them to refrain from making comments on the party’s candidate for Chief Minister during the next Assembly election.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4rfu3n/article32736748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1THEDAPPADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-backs-palaniswami-as-cm-candidate-minister/article32736750.ece

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case against a city-based IT company on the charge of cheating the State Bank of India (SBI) to the tune of ₹77.14 crore.

The CBI’s Economic Offences Wing has booked M/s Gemini Communication Ltd., a company engaged in the business of system integration and providing networking and communication solutions.

211,2020/10/01,Feedback system introduced in 52 Cuddalore police stations,"Move is aimed at curbing corruption, says police official

The Cuddalore district police have introduced a system to get feedback from the public on police personnel who they approache to get their grievances redressed.

This feedback system has been introduced in all 52 police stations, including six All-Women Police Stations in the district.

Cuddalore Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav introduced the system by having a dedicated team of personnel under his supervision to discreetly collect information from the public on whether they faced any harassment or indifferent attitude.

“The system started with passport verification to prevent cops from asking tips. Public interface with police is only through passport verification and police verification certificate for jobs. The team contacts the passport applicants on their mobile phones at random to get information on whether they faced any harassment or whether there was demand from the cops for money to process their applications,” Mr. Sree Abhinav told The Hindu.

Police stations are service delivery centres and the idea is to gauge assessment of the services rendered, he said. The system has now been extended to other services including registration of FIR/CSR.

Once an FIR is registered, the mobile phone number of the complainant is automatically generated and collected from the server. The team collects the feedback from the public on a form on all issues, including land disputes.

The applicants and complainants are randomly selected from various police sub-divisions and jurisdictions on a daily basis to enquire about the quality of service.

Identity confidential

The team alone has access to the feedback received from the applicants and complainants in all stations. The identity is kept confidential and the public too do not know the police personnel who collect the feedback.

“Though we have also received negative feedback, including complaints of harassment and delay in registering FIRs, the overall feedback has been satisfactory,” said an inspector attached to the team. The negative feedback is directly forwarded to the SP and the officers are pulled up and warned.

In some instances, they are transferred to the Armed Reserve, the inspector added. This system would go on as its purpose is to augment the interface between the public and the police on sound and healthy grounds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a36ddj/article32736680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01FEEDBACK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/feedback-system-introduced-in-52-cuddalore-police-stations/article32736681.ece
212,2020/10/01,AIADMK rift | Panneerselvam firm on steering panel,"Palaniswami camp not in favour of constituting 11-member committee.

Deputy Chief Minister and AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam, who had a sharp exchange of words with Chief Minister and party co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami at the party’s executive meeting on September 26 over a couple of issues, including the formation of a steering committee, appears to be firm on the setting up of the panel.

This was the impression gathered by party leaders who interacted with him this week. A confidant of the Deputy Chief Minister told The Hindu that as far as Mr. Panneerselvam was concerned, the issue was only about the formation of the committee, while details regarding its size and composition could be regarded as secondary.

Of course, the Panneerselvam camp expects a reasonable number of its representatives to be accommodated in the event of the constitution of the panel.

The genesis of the idea, according to the Panneerselvam camp, could be traced to the understanding it had reached with the Palaniswami camp during the merger of the two factions in 2017.

At the time, the two camps had agreed to have a steering committee with 11 members. The idea was that such a panel would provide a framework on a number of issues to enable the coordinator and the co-coordinator to arrive at “mutually acceptable” decisions. It could come in handy in the run-up to elections, when the party would have to hold discussions with many outfits on alliance matters. But the Palaniswami camp is not in favour of forming the steering committee. It is of the view that the committee, if formed, had the potential to create more complications than it could handle. Already, there are two panels in the party — the parliamentary board, which chooses candidates for elections, and the petitions committee.

If the purpose of the steering committee is to hold negotiations with other parties for an alliance, it can be served by forming an exclusive panel, as was done during the 2019 Lok Sabha election, explained two members of the CM’s camp.

They added that the selection of members for, and the exclusion of members from, the steering committee, would confound the situation.

A perusal of the Tamil text of the 12th resolution, which was moved by Radhapuram legislator I.S. Inbadurai and adopted by the AIADMK general council in September 2017, reveals no reference to the steering committee. The motion only defines the role and functions of various office-bearers, committees and wings of the party. But the term ‘steering committee’ figures at the end of the 10thresolution, allowing the creation of the posts of coordinator, co-coordinator and deputy coordinators.

Meanwhile, Mr. Panneerselvam on Wednesday continued to hold consultations with his supporters at his residence on Greenways Road in Chennai.

213,2020/10/01,"Replica of Oussudu Lake, a feather in Puducherry’s cap","Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy inaugurates Oussudu Interpretation Centre, which aims to offer a study of the flora and fauna of one of the important wetlands of Asia

A microcosm of the outlying Oussudu Lake, the roosting spot for a variety of migratory birds, has been recreated through a tableaux of life-like models on the premises of the Department of Forests and Wildlife.

The Oussudu Interpretation Centre replicates the characteristics of the lake’s ecosystem, especially its avifauna, through a mix of artistic landscaping, three-dimensional modelling, paintings and stone sculptures.

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy formally opened the centre to the public on Wednesday and undertook a survey of the features.

Top wetland

Apart from recreating the biodiversity of Oussudu, recognised as one of the important wetlands of Asia by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the interpretation centre also offers a study of other local or endemic floral and faunal attributes, such as Olive Ridley turtles. A stone sculpture at the entrance captures all the four State symbols of Puducherry — the Asian Koel, the Indian Palm Squirrel, the Cannon Ball Flower and the Vilva Tree.

Paintings on kadappa stone (black limestone) feature species such as the Brahminy Kite, Painted Stork, Purple Swamphen and the Pheasant Tailed Jacana, while a fibre sculpture of the Greater Flamingos and single stone carvings of the Indian Chameleon, Russel Viper and Fan-Throated Lizard greet visitors at the entrance.

Inside the special gel replica of the lake are featured ferro cement and fibre canvas models of 22 avifauna species of Oussudu, an ecosystem which falls under the joint aegis of the Governments of Puducherry and Tamil Nadu.

The models have been positioned with an astonishing degree of precision exactly as they would be perched in natural habitat.

The two-storeyed building housing the interpretation centre could well be the country’s first art-based facility of its kind created by a team of officials led by G. Sathiyamoorthy, Conservator of Forests.

Conceived under a Centrally-sponsored scheme, the National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco System, at a cost of ₹86 lakh, it took nearly two years to realise the carefully curated project. The centre has come up on a final cost of about ₹1 crore, including the landscaping and art theme expenditure.

“The centre is unique in being art-themed and also in that every detail is hand-crafted, right down to the texts accompanying the exhibits which are handwritten and not digitally produced,” said Vanjulavalli Karthik, Deputy Conservator of Forests.

A group of about 25 wildlife artists associated with the Universal Eco Foundation, a city-based biodiversity conservation and awareness disseminating organisation, were commissioned for making the exhibits. No effort has been spared to provide a real-life feel to the models, right down to the taxonomic specifics of each species.

Rich experience

The Forest Department has planned the centre to serve as a half-day tour with the added experience of visiting the adjacent deer park.

“We are planning to have a full-time guide to assist visitors. And in the long term, we could even provide a day-long experience for visitors by connecting a trip to the centre with an urban forest trail,” Ms. Karthik said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nu4csq/article32736355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OUSSUDU2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/replica-of-oussudu-lake-a-feather-in-puducherrys-cap/article32736357.ece

215,2020/10/01,Huge demand pushes up price of Teja variety red chilli,"Famous for its culinary and medicinal uses, there is spurt in demand for the commodity in various south Asian countries

The burgeoning domestic and export demand for the Teja variety of red chilli, famous for its culinary, medicinal and other wide-ranging uses, pushed up the price of the pungent fruit at Khammam Agriculture Market, housing Telangana's second largest chilli market yard, here.

According to the market sources, the Teja variety of red chilli commanded a price of ₹ 16,500 - ₹ 17,000 per quintal in the market on Thursday, fetching a relatively better price for the sellers, mostly comprising the traders and big farmers those, who stocked the commodity in cold storage units in Khammam division. Last week, the red chilli commanded a high price in the range of ₹ 20,000 per quintal when the demand for the commodity in the domestic and international market suddenly surged owing to a combination of factors, mainly the short supply of red chillies from Madhya Pradesh due to heavy rains.

The upswing in the prices of red chillies, driven by the spurt in demand for the commodity from various south Asian countries including China, failed to benefit small and medium chilli growers as they had sold their produce to traders during the last harvesting season that coincided with the coronavirus lockdown earlier this year, sources said. The traders and a handful of big farmers, who stocked the commodity in cold storages, are now reaping the benefits of the surge in demand for red chilli, sources added.

Red chilli was cultivated in about 52,000 acres in the last crop season (rabi) in the district, known as the largest producer of chilli in the State. So far in the current kharif season, chilli seedlings were transplanted in about 53,000 acres across the district. Officials of the Horticulture Department expect the area under chilli cultivation to increase by another 7,000 acres this season considering the suitable agro-climatic conditions and the prevailing remunerative prices.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/47ln42/article32746934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY02TEJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/huge-demand-pushes-up-price-of-teja-variety-red-chilli/article32746935.ece
216,2020/10/01,Phishing gang busted,"Its members ‘created’ duplicate FB account of SP

The phishing gang that allegedly created the duplicate Facebook account of Nalgonda SP A.V. Ranganath last month, with a view to making a fast buck, was nabbed at a village near Bharatpur of Rajasthan, police sources said on Thursday.

Not only the social media account of the SP, but as many as 230 officers’ accounts from south Indian States were targeted. At least, a hundred police officers from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were among them, officials said.

An investigation team that had gone to Rajasthan, reportedly following a cyber trail, was believed to have crucial evidence to pin down the miscreants. Four key persons of the total 15 suspects, including a minor, were being brought to Nalgonda.

“About 20 SIM cards were found with them. They were also able to manipulate the tower location of their SIM card, and used each card for not more than five mobile payment transactions,” an official said.

They were not educated beyond the 10th grade, but created a database of photographs and related credentials to make money.

On September 18, Mr. Ranganath was alerted by a friend to a mobile payment request to be done in favour of his wife. The cyber team soon confirmed that a duplicate account had been created, and as per information, the miscreants’ location was Odisha. The location was later found to be false.

The accused would be produced before media soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/phishing-gang-busted/article32746608.ece
217,2020/10/01,2BHK only an electoral issue for TRS: Bhatti,"‘Party failed to fulfil promises till date’

Launching a scathing attack on the TRS dispensation for allegedly failing to deliver on its “oft repeated promise” of constructing 2,000 two bedroom (2BHK) houses each year in Khammam, the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka alleged that only 417 two-bedroom houses were constructed in the town so far in the past seven years.

“The persons at the helm have made the same promise of providing housing to all eligible homeless poor people repeatedly in all the previous elections including Assembly, Lok Sabha, Gram Panchayat and the civic polls, but failed to fulfil their much-touted promises till date,” he charged.

Around 14,000 two-bedroom houses should have been constructed by now as per their promise, but the ground reality speaks volumes about the “hollowness” of the claims of the ruling dispensation, Mr Vikramarka flayed. He was speaking to reporters after visiting the ‘2BHK houses’ under construction at Dwamsalapuram and Allipuram near here on Thursday.

The TRS has made a promise in its 2018 election manifesto to provide financial assistance to poor people for construction of houses in their own plots. This still remains on paper, he alleged. He charged the TRS local leaders with “hoodwinking” people by repeating “false promises” for electoral gains.

With the elections for Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) slated to be held next year, the ruling party leaders are trying to repeat the “publicity gimmicks” to “sway” electors with the same old unfulfilled promise, he criticised. Prior to the last civic polls, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had promised alternative houses to the poor people living in the areas along the Gollapadu channel in the town, he said, alleging that it still remained unimplemented.

“The local leaders of the ruling party should seek votes only after fulfilling their earlier promises and this time the enlightened denizens of Khammam will teach them a fitting lesson at the hustings,” the CLP leader said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kfzo1n/article32746588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY02BHATI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2bhk-only-an-electoral-issue-for-trs-bhatti/article32746589.ece
218,2020/10/01,Criminal case against Hanamkonda inspector,"Complaint of his aiding an accused in extortion case is being probed

A criminal case has been registered against inspector of Hanamkonda police station in Warangal Police Commissionerate, Dayakar, who was accused of aiding and abetting the accused in an extortion case.

The inspector was transferred and attached to the headquarters to ensure he did not interfere or attempt to influence the ongoing investigation, sources in police said. A 58-year-old person, Ravinder, approached top officials of the Warangal police recently alleging that a person called Kiran and his associates detained and had beaten him up after confining him in a room in Hanamkonda.

Ravinder, reported to be sarpanch of a village in Mulugu district, had sold a piece of land to Kiran. Accusing Ravinder of selling him a disputed land, Kiran and his associates detained Ravinder and beat him up before forcing him to sign on some documents.

The complainant charged that the inspector too was present when he was beaten up. “An internal inquiry was ordered and prima facie evidence was found against the inspector,” an officer supervising the probe seeking anonymity said. Ravinder also alleged that he was later taken to Hanamkonda police station and there the inspector had beaten him up.

He was allegedly forced to sign some papers in the police station mortgaging a property to Kiran and others. Some bank cheque leaves were forcibly taken from him. His thumb impressions were obtained on bond papers.

“Evidence of video records of Ravinder being taken to police station and phone conversations were secured. The inspector beating up the complainant is being further probed,” the officer said.

The case was assigned to Narsampet ACP for investigation.

Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy has urged Chief Minister K. Chadrasekhar Rao to include the Narayanpet-Kodangal Lift Irrigation scheme in the agenda of the Apex Council meeting to be held on October 6.

In a letter to the Chief Minister, he said the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) had responded favourably to his letter on August 20 and suggested that the State government take it up and that they had no objection. “In its reply on September 24, the KRMB has said let the State government provide them with all the details for further action,” he said.

The letter from KRMB is a clear indication that the ball was in the State government’s court. Since the KRMB was favourable, the State government should include it in the Apex Council meeting agenda, he demanded.

He reminded that the project was sanctioned in the combined Andhra Pradesh and money was also released for a survey of the project that would irrigate a lakh acres in the backward Mahabubnagar district apart from providing drinking water to the villages.

TPCC working president, Ponnam Prabhakar has demanded the TRS government to pass a resolution in the Assembly against the three farmers bills passed in the Parliament if the party was siding with the farmers genuinely.

At a press conference, here he said Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao should take the initiative if he was sincere in opposing the bills that would destroy the farmers forever and push them into the clutches of corporates. He reminded that even political parties that close to the BJP were also opposing the bills.

Mr. Prabhakar accused the Chief Minister was shedding crocodile tears on the farmers bills opposing them in the Parliament but doing nothing on the ground to support farmers opposition. “Why is the TRS not on the roads protesting the bills?” he asked.

He ridiculed the Central Government’s claim that they would change the fortune of the farmers and said these bills would ensure that the farmers will end up as labourers in their own fields. The bills would corporatise agriculture sector and would ultimately lands will be in the hands of a few corporates.

Reminding that the Congress party was opposed to the bills in the present form right from the beginning, he said the unrest of farmers in North India is an indication of the fears which the BJP is totally blind to. He said the Congress would side with the farmers.

226,2020/10/01,Khammam hospital equipped with liquid oxygen tank,"Set up at ₹50 lakh under the aegis of TSMSIDC, the tank’s capacity is equivalent to that of 1,400 oxygen cylinders

The district headquarters hospital, with around 200 oxygen-supported beds earmarked for COVID-19 patients, has acquired the much-needed Liquid Oxygen Tank (LOT) paving the way for hassle-free oxygen supply to needy patients.

Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar on Wednesday inaugurated the 13-KV LOT installed at a cost of ₹50 lakh under the aegis of the Telangana State Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TSMSIDC) on the hospital premises. The tank has the capacity of 13,000 litres of liquid oxygen equivalent to 1,400 oxygen cylinders, sources said.

Once filled, it will help maintain a reserve stock of oxygen and facilitate uninterrupted oxygen supply through the internal pipeline system to the COVID-19 ward, Intensive Care Units and ‘Mata-Sishu Kendram’ at the hospital for nine days continuously, sources said.

Thanks to the initiative of Collector R.V. Karnan, the long-awaited facility has become a reality at a time when the demand for oxygen has increased multifold amid the pandemic. Last month, the demand for oxygen exceeded the supply in several hospitals in the district as the authorised private suppliers struggled to cope with the surge in demand for the life saving gas for a couple of days, when the COVID-19 cases surged suddenly.

Timely intervention of the district administration helped improve the supply of oxygen cylinders in the last couple of weeks.

Speaking after inaugurating the tank at the hospital here on Wednesday, Mr Ajay said the facility will help ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen to cater to the requirements of needy patients at the hospital round-the-clock.

Khammam district headquarters hospital is the second government healthcare facility in the State to get the LOT after Siddipet district, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/jgzzyo/article32736423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY30-KHAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/khammam-hospital-equipped-with-liquid-oxygen-tank/article32736410.ece
227,2020/10/01,We’ve used this break well: Fleming,"Chennai Super Kings had a tough first week with three matches over six days at three venues. With two consecutive losses, a week’s break came at the right time and coach Stephen Fleming has said it has helped the side regroup.

“We’ve used this break pretty well, we got some clarity around what we need to do and have practised very well,” said Fleming speaking in the team’s website ahead of CSK’s match against Sunrisers Hyderabad in Dubai on Friday.

With CSK playing four of its next five matches in Dubai, Fleming hoped his side will have the chance to settle in after struggling to read the conditions in its opening fixtures.

228,2020/10/01,The wisdom of being Amur,"It was not just amazing scholarship, but also an innate goodness and ethical consciousness that made GS Amur who passed away recently a teacher and critic who everyone admired

“Never react impulsively, these are strategies to provoke you into a parochial debate. Those of you who have read me will always understand, I need not write a rejoinder.” More than a decade ago, deeply disturbed by an article labelling him as a “critic from the colonial era” I called up Professor G S Amur and briefed him of the details, requesting him to offer a rebuttal. Calm, collected and undisturbed as ever, Amur gave me what was wisdom for a lifetime.

Teacher, writer, translator and critic, Amur’s career spanned over seven decades. Born into a family that struggled to make ends meet, in a remote village of Bommanahalli in Haveri district, Gururaja Shyamacharya Amur, would sleep in the village temple at night for want of space at home. A weak eyesight did not come in the way of his appetite for voracious reading. Amur started off reading Sanskrit classics before entering the realms of Kannada and English literature. At Karnatak College, Dharwad, he happened to meet Sriranga, V. K. Gokak and Armando Menezes who were his teachers. The association lasted for life. Amur would actively edit the college magazine and write poetry in English. As a student, he published a farewell speech of his beloved Principal, Correa Affonso: “When the sunset of life comes, let it be as soft and gentle as the sunsets of Dharwad”. Affonso’s words struck a chord with young minds, kindling a lifelong love for Dharwad.

Amur topped every examination he took. One of the awards from the University of Bombay was a set of classics with specially embossed coat of arms. Amur requested for a cash prize instead. He was in dire need of money for spectacles to read and study. He neither complained nor grumbled about his poverty. At a young, impressionable age, he had attained a state of equanimity.

He approached Dr. V. K. Gokak for his Ph.D. and Gokak suggested he research on “the future of the epic.” Amur, however, was more interested in exploring Comedy and found a willing mentor in Professor Armando Menezes, Head of the Department of English, at Karnatak University, Dharwad. Amur happily typed away his thesis on his good old typewriter on sheets of Radio Bond Austrian paper (popular during the 60s and 70s), while teaching English Literature at JT College, Gadag. Whenever he brought the typed pages for discussion to the University campus, he would be intercepted by Professor KJ Shah. Shah had returned from Cambridge with an MA in Philosophy under the tutelage of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Wrangler Pavate, the then Vice-Chancellor of Karnatak University, had appointed Shah as Professor and Head of the Department of Philosophy. Rooted in Analytical Philosophy and Logical Positivism, Shah would grill research scholars and nudge them to think deeper. No wonder, Amur’s PhD thesis not only went on to become one of the finest treatises on the concept of Comedy, but continues to be in print and much cited sixty years after it was written. From Kumta to Gadag, Dharwad to Aurangabad, Amur left an abiding influence on legions of students.

After he retired as Head of the English Department at the Babasaheb Dr. B. R. Ambedkar University in Aurangabad in 1985, he returned to Dharwad for a life of quietude that enabled him to concentrate on Kannada writing. All his life, he rejected administrative posts to focus on teaching, research and writing.

“Janaki” his home at Navodayanagar, Dharwad became a hub of intellectual activity. Poets, novelists, critics, research scholars and teachers would gather around Amur for enchanting discussions over endless cups of tea and coffee. “Amma” as we affectionately called the late Shanta Amur, was a maternal figure in our lives. The very first chapter of Amur’s autobiography in Kannada centres around her. After her passing away in 2014, I would often spend many days at his home. I used to sleep in the room that was usually reserved for students and guests. Amur Sir would knock at my door early in the morning. “I am up Sir!” “Good Morning, Manjunath, I have a glass of hot milk for you.” He would elaborate on the Krishna-Arjuna dialogue from the Mahabharata or the Yama-Nachiketa dialogue from the Kathopinashad or the Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad while I sat mesmerised, taking sips from the glass of milk. Amur would quote characters from the classics as if they were his best friends!

Every year, I visited him on Vijayadashami in Dasara, to offer banni leaves as gratitude to the great teacher. Amur would offer Banni leaves in return, along with a story from the Mahabharata. With Amur’s passing away and Dasara fast approaching, I feel a void in my life. With the wisdom that he carried, I would like to believe that the Banni tree is symbolic of this great teacher himself -- vast, timeless and profound.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-wisdom-of-being-amur/article32747605.ece
229,2020/10/01,Enduring love for literature,"Dr. G.S. Amur, who passed away recently at the age of 95, occupies a unique position among the literary critics in Kannada. This exceptional scholar and critic was not swayed by the demands of literary/social movements and stuck to the canons of literary theory and criticism

Gururaja Shyamacharya Amur’s (1925-2020) departure acquires a symbolic dimension in view of the anti-intellectual and anti-academic atmosphere that pervades the contemporary literary scenario in Karnataka. Cultural polemics based on societal and political issues and an effervescent creativity that relies more on experiences, ideas and attitudes rather than a meaningful dialogue with language are vying with one another to gain attention. These forces are abetted by media which revel in exaggeration and adulations.

Dr. Amur who excelled as a scholar and literary critic for seven decades was a brilliant student with a firm grounding in English, Sanskrit and Kannada. He obtained a doctoral degree in English for his much-celebrated treatise, ‘The Concept of Comedy: A Restatement’ (1963) and occupied various academic positions in Karnatak University, Dharwad and Marathwada University, Aurangabad. He had stints of academic research in Yale University and Santa Barbara University, California as a Senior Fulbright scholar (1972-73). He was sponsored by the British Council to work as a researcher in the United Kingdom. He was awarded the D.Litt. degree by Karnatak University in 2012.

He laid greater emphasis on his writings in English prior to his retirement and shifted his focus towards Kannada literary criticism, thereafter. He was slightly disillusioned with literature as an institution during the last decade of his life and pursued philosophical and spiritual pursuits as evident by his works on Mahabharata, Bhagavad-Gita and Dakshinamurthy Stotra. However, all these phases were suffused with academic rigour and his major interests were interwoven.

Dr. Amur occupies a unique position among the literary critics in Kannada. He was not swayed by the demands of literary/social movements and stuck to the canons of literary theory and criticism as practiced in the West, even though he was familiar with the tenets Indian Poetics. He could apply the theory and the tools obtained there to Kannada literary works belonging to various genres. His scholarship was not confined to the British and American varieties of literary practices and encompassed the continental modes also. He did not enter the portals of now prevalent cultural criticism and managed to have his say without any bias. But academic scholarship if it becomes an end in itself, could prevent a critic from observing emergent social patterns and the consequent creative modes.

Dr Amur has published about thirty books in English. They constitute three domains. He has written extensively on Indian writers in English. He has edited many books containing essays that serve the purposes of pedagogy. He has done yeoman service to Karnataka by translating many literary classics from Kannada into English. They include, ‘The Spider and the Web’ a very competent translation of many important poems by poet Da.Ra. Bendre. He has translated novels such as ‘Sandhyaraaga’ by A.N. Krishna Rao and ‘Om Namo’ by Shantinatha Desai. His monographs on Manohar Malgonkar, A.N. Krishna Rao, Dattatreya Ramachandra Bendre and Shantinath Desai serve as useful introductions to the writers and their oeuvre. ‘T.S. Eliot’s Poetics’, ‘Ideas and Images’ and ‘Saints and Poets’ all the three published by Writer’s Workshop, Calcutta, represent Amur’s foray into more theoretical topics.

Noted critic Giraddi Govindraj releasing collection of plays of Girish Karnad and a book by G.S. Amur at a function organised by Manohar Granthmala in Dharwad.

Amur has carved a niche for himself in Kannada as a literary critic of enduring merit. He has published forty odd books all of them dealing with literary criticism. He has adapted various modes of writing such as Book Reviews, literary biographies, practical criticism, literary theory et al. It is a matter of curiosity that all his writings are confined to modern Kannada literature. Pre-modern Kannada literature spanning ten centuries is conspicuous by its absence in his literary musings. However, he has written extensively about fiction, poetry, drama, criticism and other literary forms. Fiction was his forte, as evidenced by well-thumbed volumes surveying Kannada novels and short stories. He made it a point to study a writer in all aspects of his life and writings as a continuum. ‘Bhuvanada Bhagya’ a full-length study of the life and works of Da.Ra. Bendre, won him the prestigious Central Sahitya Akademi award. This is pioneering work tracing the evolution of a writer through his entire career and evaluating his works in their entirety. It goes to the credit of this great writer that he could write another book ‘Ommukha’ delineating Bendre’s poetics and discussing the merits of his translations. He has written similar analytical and objective books on Kuvempu, Shriranga and U.R. Ananthamurthy.

Prof. Amur was deeply concerned about the themes and forms of literary works. He was interested in the internal dynamics of a work caused by literary devices such as metaphor, image and stylistic idiosyncrasies. He could also trace the evolution of a writer during his career. His vast reading and an ability to retrieve them at will helped him in making comparative assessment. He could overcome regional and personal bias unlike many of his illustrious peers. His writings on Kuvempu in general and ‘Sri Ramayana Darshanam’ in particular, bear witness to this. Similarly, he could transcend literary movements and write about great writers such as Masti Venkatesha Iyengar, Shivarama Karanth, Yashwant Chittal, Lankesh, Tejasvi, Devanuru Mahadeva, Veena Shanteshvara and Vaidehi with equal concern and competence. Amur was intellectually so active till the very end, and his huge volume on Dakshinamurthy Stotram came out early this year.

Amur preferred the matter of fact, academic writing and did not seek limelight at any point of time. Nor did he aspire to be the darling of the media and crowds by making deliberate controversial statements. He was not a great orator, but had the desire of a teacher who wants to communicate, in fact, he was very stimulating in personal conversations. Success, in terms of awards and accolades did not come to him as a matter of course. He had to wait for them. He has received Central Akademi Award, Pampa Prashasti, Rajyotsava Award, Nrupatunga Award, and Karnataka Sahitya Akademi Lifetime Award and many other prizes.

I had the fortune of meeting him frequently after he shifted his residence to Bangalore because we lived in the same locality. We used to have long conversations mostly about academic and cultural issues. Lately, he was more concerned about life in its philosophical aspects. He was drawn towards Indian Philosophy in its myriad aspects. He used to remember Dr. Subbaramaiah, a professor of Nuclear Physics and his spiritual mentor with great reverence and fondness. I do not want to forget his affection for me. I represent many of his students scattered all over the country. We should celebrate the life of pious persons like Dr. Amur rather than mourn his death. It’s my wish to end this note by recording my tributes to his late wife, Shantha Amur, who held a degree in Physics and was an abiding source of inspiration to him.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/enduring-love-for-literature/article32747577.ece
230,2020/10/01,The Big Brother of Bangalore,"Janopakari Doddanna worked selflessly and tirelessly for Bengaluru

K.H. Ramaiah, a prominent personality of yesteryear Bangalore, often referred Gubbi Thotadappa as a fatherly figure (appa), Janopakari Doddanna as (Anna), elder brother. The services they rendered encompassed a very large strata of the city irrespective of class, cast and creed.

A vivid description of the life and contribution of Doddanna to Bengaluru is found Prof. V Krishna Setty’s book (1997), who had a long association with the institution founded by Doddanna.

Doddanna Shetty was born on February 3, 1840 to a pious couple Nanjundappa and Siddamma. They belonging to a vegetable oil extracting and trading community. They lived in Commercial Street in Cantonment area during 1830s. In addition to being god fearing and spiritual, the couple were also widely known for their charity and hospitality. Nanjundappa was the head of the community and was referred to as ‘Yajaman’.

Doddanna, got the education required for the family business, and after the death of his father assumed the post of Yajaman, and continued the family trade. He had also inherited the parents’ trait of charity and hospitality and without any bias, helped the downtrodden to live with dignity.

He used to go during night with a few of his associates to distribute good food and blankets to help the destitute and vagabonds on the streets and also the wandering monks who took shelter at Poornaiah Choultry which was located next to Tulasi Thota near Dharmambudi Tank, the present day Kempegowda Central Bus stand.

Paramount Theatre

He renovated the Lakshminarasimha Swamy temple, his family deity, on Old Poor House Road in Cantonment and liberally donated for such work undertaken by other temples in Bengaluru. He had also given away a portion of his land near Bangalore East Railway station for the use of Buddha Centre. Because of these liberal contributions he used to be even referred to as ‘Daanashoora Karna’, a prominent character known for such charitable acts in the epic, Mahabharata. In spite of being benevolent to the society, as if to test his inner strength to face the adversities, he lost three wives, one after the other. Though two sons were born to the fourth wife she too died soon.

Yet, he recovered from these onslaughts of the fate and continued to serve his city. During 1898, there was severe plague attack in Bengaluru and the first son Lakshminarayana fell a victim for the pandemic. Realising that isolation is the sole solution to prevent the spread of the disease, Doddanna got about two hundred shelters built in a village Venkatapura for the benefit of the members of his community. The plague had also deprived the education to many downtrodden children. To groom the future generation on proper moral and ethical grounds, he took some space near the present day KR Market in 1900 and started a lower secondary school to impart free education especially for poor children. He treated these kids as his own and took personal care even in giving them oil bath, food and clothing.

Pouring a major chunk of his wealth he also started to construct a huge building to run the school. He wanted this structure to represent the culture and ethics of the land and should also be big enough to serve the purpose of a school, choultry, theatre and assembly hall. Later, his building became a landmark in the city as Doddanna hall and also as Paramount theatre.

Around the year 1900, the Mysore Government had started the construction of the building of Revenue Survey Office in Cubbon Park, near KR circle. The contractor, Tatayaa had given the responsibility of the construction to Rangappa. Everyday, while walking from Cantonment to his school in the City Market area, Doddanna used to pause a little and observe the construction and used to discussthe details with Rangappa. Finally, when the building was completed, he liked the elegant front elevation of the structure and the excellent quality of work. He wanted his building also to represent the native culture and tradition. He engage d Rangappa to give his dream a realistic shape.

Inspiration for Doddanna Hall

The construction work under his personal supervision was going on. At this juncture, fate shot another major blow by taking away the life of his second and the only surviving son, Lakshminarasimha. Since the son died at the beginning of the construction, some elders advised him not to continue the work as his planetary positions were not in his favour. But, he accepted the adversities as challenges and proceeded with the work.

Doddanna’s philanthropic activities and his persisting efforts for the welfare of the downtrodden in spite of stumbling blocks, were known to the elite of the city.

Some other elders told him that his walking all the way from Cantonment to the City Market area was strenuous, Doddanna did not agree. “I can afford to have a personal coach for my movement. But, I feel, the money I spend for the same can be used to get few more cups of milk or oil to give bath to the poor little ones in my school…”

231,2020/10/01,A much-needed aid,"Sanchaya, a theatre group in Bangalore, through its initiate Sanchaya Cares, wishes to support artistes whose livelihoods have been robbed due to the pandemic

The Covid19 pandemic has affected everyone. Majority of the population had two battles to face early this year – one on the health front, the other on the financial front. While for some, things seem to be getting better, the artistic community continues to be severely hit, making everyday living itself a huge burden. Given the situation where no live art performances are possible, most artistes are out of livelihood.

Narayanappa (name changed) is one such professional artiste in Bengaluru who has spent almost 60 years of his life in theatre activities. To make ends meet, he now does mono-act and dialogue delivery in temples hoping the visitors would appreciate and offer some money. “All he knows and has done throughout his life is ‘theatre’. So what else do you expect him to do?” asks Keerthi Bhanu, Founding Member, Sanchaya, a three-decade-old theatre group in Bengaluru.

“To see our fellow actors and technicians going through this crisis is painful. We initially managed to put together one lakh rupees and supported 33 senior artistes. But there was a large group that we had left out, and we decided to do something on a larger scale,” he explains. Those who received the modest Rs. 3000 wrote long, thanking letters. “It meant so much to them.”

Most artistes do not want “free money”. They want to perform, and be paid for it. To address this problem, the team conceptualised ‘Sanchaya Cares’ through which the theatre fraternity could gather funds and support artistes in a dignified manner. Through this initiative, a set of plays are selected, recorded and uploaded for online viewership. This will not only make these plays available to Kannadigas around the world, but also gives these artistes visibility.

Sanchaya’s idea has been welcomed by the entire fraternity. Video recordists and lighting experts have offered their service at lower rates than usual. Shankaraa Foundation offered its auditorium free of cost to record their plays. “Director Pawan Kumar was so delighted to know about this initiative that he offered his web space, Filmmakers’ United Club, launched in June this year for supporting cinema and other art forms during the pandemic,” informs Bhanu.

Sanchaya plans to support senior and women artistes through this carefully monitored initiative. Apart from money collected through tickets for each of their shows, it also seeks donations from individuals and corporates willing to support the cause. Those who support the cause get free access to watch our plays.

To start with, the team has selected five plays – Shraddha mattu Stainless Steel Patregalu, based on the essays by Vasudhendra and Srinivasa Vaidya, Shakespeare’s Tempest and Neeru Kudisida Neereyaru, Prasanna’s Tadroopi and TP Kailasam’s Ammavra Ganda, performed by Vati Kuteera, Sanchaya, Samashti and Prakasam.

Sanchaya Cares will be inaugurated on Filmmakers United Club (thefuc.in) on October 2. Tickets are priced at Rs. 400.

232,2020/10/01,Meet the postcard girls,"On World Postcard Day today, meet the women who go beyond WhatsApp chats and Insta DMs and have not given up on this quaint mode of communication

When most people were tired of social distancing during the lockdown, Disha Shah sat for long hours writing postcards to her loved ones. “I realised that most of them didn’t even know where the nearest post offices are. That’s when I got the idea to revive the culture of sending postcards,” says the Ahmedabad-based enthusiast, who recently started writepostcard.com, a service that sends personalised and curated postcards on behalf of individuals.

In July, Rohini Kejriwal, founder of the Alipore Post, started off a pen pal programme. “Chitthi Exchange came about when my intern, Tanishka Pandey, was keen to work on a community-based activity to help people connect with strangers and forge new friendships. We keep it simple: those interested filled in a Google Form, with an intuitive pairing done by me,” says Kejriwal, who has now connected almost 1,500 pen pals (750 pairs) across India and the world.

Not just a hobby

While men like Vishnu Ravishankar (@zoro_pc), Ludhiana-based Pulkit Kochhar (@swap_it_india), and Coimbatore-based Viknesh Kumar (@vikki56pc) do actively contribute to the community, women seem to be a dominant presence in the postcard community. Even before the pandemic, Bengaluru-based Anupama Gummaraju has been writing postcards to people across the world for more than a year now. “However brief the interaction may be [because of the limited space], I’ve had glimpses of people’s lives that really drive home the point that we are all just humans navigating this world as best as we can,” says the co-owner of an educational initiative, Tide Learning.

Both adults and kids can learn a lot about the world through postcards, she says. “Kindergarten and primary grade schoolteachers in the UK and the US carry out projects where they receive postcards from different countries. Parents who home-school their kids often swap postcards to educate their kids about history, geography, cultures, food, and habits from around the world,” Gummaraju explains, adding, “I’m 48 now — it’s never too late to start.”

An undying faith

In the last two years, Pune-based Anushka Sawarkar (@anushka.postcards) has exchanged more than 1,500 postcards with people from almost 80 countries. Apart from meeting a few of her pen pals in real life, she has also got to know her local postal workers. “I have a great rapport with them and they absolutely love seeing the different postcards I receive from around the world,” she says. For Chennai-based artist S Padma Malini, postcards are her canvas. The 38-year-old artist took time during the lockdown to create a social media page dedicated to her work (@theplainpaperspage on Instagram). “MF Husain used to travel with 100 postcards to draw his artwork. The day I got to learn this, I was inspired to do the same,” says Malini.

Mumbai-based medical student, Bhumika Sunil Israni, who has been sending and receiving snail mail for the past two and a half years says that the lockdown was harder with no postcards to look forward to. “An empty mailbox did make me feel sad, but then I decided to reread the ones I already had. Unlike emails or phone messages, this was like a journey in the better past. The postcards started pouring in from June onwards, when postal services resumed,” she says. Israni now knows people living in more than 100 countries. “My family says that wherever I end up in the world, I will always have someone to shelter me,” she concludes with a laugh.

233,2020/10/01,Artist Dinesh Magar’s brass-etched works on display,"The exhibition, titled Heaven Sent, is on at gallery g and is organised in association with Sandeep & Gitanjali Maini Foundation

Dinesh Magar’s brass-etched enamel paintings are famous in the art world. “The wide ranging palette and decorative elements in Dinesh’s work demand deft hands and a sensitive mind,” says art historian Choodamani Nandagopal.

gallery g, in association with Sandeep & Gitanjali Maini Foundation, hosts Heaven Sent, by Bengaluru-based Magar. The show features 18 works in a convergence of painting, mural and sculpture in brass.

Explaining his process, Magar says he starts with pencil and pen drawings, which are transferred onto brass sheets. “Crystals are embedded after etching, enamelling and finishing.” Magar uses Swarovski crystals. “My work can be called a contemporary avatar of traditional Thanjavur and Mysore paintings. It has to be royal.”

Magar studied Applied Art at the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath (CKP) and graduated in 1993. He initially started out as an art visualiser at leading advertising agencies and worked in Visual Merchandising for Madura Garments. His company, Kalpa Corporate Artz, creates fine art reproductions with permission from palaces and museums. “We also provide creative consulting, artworks and end-to-end design solutions for corporate interiors.” Magar wanted to make art affordable and is happy he curated nearly 50,000 paintings for corporate offices across India and abroad.

While working in advertising, Magar expanded his range and embraced a range of media and themes: from intricate pen-and-ink drawings and paintings on brass, to sculptures and mixed media on canvas. He received acclaim for his work and was awarded the Creative Excellence Award by Svetoslav Roerich, the then-president of CKP.

“His work is an exploration of immeasurable detailing using intricate lines and vibrant colours,” says Gitanjali Maini, managing director, gallery g. The 50-year-old artist, who has been pursuing his passion for more than 27 years, says brass paintings live for over 1,000 years. “It can be a priceless treasure for art museums and art collectors across the world,” says Magar.

The paints used are special stoving enamels/UV paints which are mixed to achieve desired colours. The etching and colouring is manually done and the brass plates are transferred to industrial ovens at 180 degrees centigrade to ensure permanent fixing of colours. “Once the firing is complete, the painting is scrubbed, lacquered and buffed for sheen and lustre,” says Magar, who sources his brass sheets from Haryana and Mexico. The paintings have gold and silver finish.

The paintings cost between ₹3 lakh and ₹25 lakh. “The cost takes into account the precious material and the labour involved. I take three months for a 2 x 2 feet artwork. It involves research into mythology. Even a painting this small generally has about 30 crystals.”

Magar rues the fact that people have lost touch with mythological tales. “Technology has pushed people to forget what fine lines in hand drawing mean, and they cannot relate to the stories I use.”

“The incidents which took place after the death of the victim on 29.09.2020 leading up to her cremation, as alleged, have shocked our conscience, therefore, we are taking suo moto cognisance of the same,” the Lucknow Bench said.

Justices Rajan Roy and Jaspreet Singh said the matter was of “immense public importance and public interest as it involves allegation of high handedness by the State authorities resulting in violation of the basic human and fundamental rights not only of the deceased victim but also of her family members”.

As it is, the deceased victim was treated with extreme brutality by the perpetrators of the crime and what is alleged to have happened thereafter, if true, amounts to perpetuating the misery of the family and rubbing salt in their wounds, noted the court.

The court directed the Senior Registrar to register a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) with the title, “In Re : Right to decent and dignified last rites/cremation”.

Referring to details of the case through news reports, the court said it was inclined to examine whether there has been gross violation of the fundamental rights of the deceased victim and her the family members; whether the State authorities acted oppressively high-handedly and illegally to violate such rights as if it is found to be so, then, this would be a case where accountability will not only have to be fixed but for future guidance also stern action would be required.

The court said it would also examine whether the economic and social status of the deceased’s family has been taken advantage of by the State authorities to oppress and deprive them of their Constitutional rights.

The court said it would leave open for its consideration on future dates if there was a need for getting the case probed through an independent agency or monitoring the investigation of the SIT (special investigation team) formed by the government.

NIA special judge Pranjal Das granted bail to Mr. Gogoi on a surety of ₹30,000 and routine conditions, including not tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses.

The special court on August 7 had rejected his bail plea in the other case, which was registered at Chandmari police station. He then filed a petition challenging it in the Gauhati High Court, which admitted the matter on September 28 and fixed October 13 as the next date of hearing.

Advocate Santanu Borthakur appeared for Mr. Gogoi while SC Kayal represented NIA as its standing counsel.

Mr. Gogoi, the leader of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), was arrested on December 12 last year from Jorhat, during the height of the anti-CAA protests in the state, as a “preventive measure” in view of the deteriorating law and order situation and his three associates were taken into custody the next day.

They were later handed over to the NIA and booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for their alleged role in the violent protest and possible links with Maoists.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah will be leading the BJP’s charge in West Bengal and will be headed to the State just ahead of Durga Puja, later this month, to address a workers meeting there.

Senior leaders in Delhi and West Bengal met at party president J.P. Nadda’s residence on Thursday for nearly four hours to hammer out some of the programmes to play up the political activity in the State. West Bengal is scheduled to go to Assembly polls early next year.

Among those who attended the meeting were Mr. Shah, Mr. Nadda, general secretary in-charge of West Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya, newly appointed vice-president Mukul Roy, State chief Dilip Ghosh, former State chief Rahul Sinha and national joint general secretary Shivprakash.

After the meeting, Mr. Ghosh told the media that it was mostly about poll preparedness and to ramp up political activity after the lockdown. He confirmed that Mr. Shah will visit the State just before Durga Pooja sets in, likely just ahead of the important dates from Panchami to Ashtami. Mr. Shah would be overseeing much of the party strategy with regard to West Bengal going ahead.

According to senior BJP leaders present at the meeting, the discontent expressed by Mr. Sinha on his being dropped as national secretary after Mr. Nadda reconstituted the national team of office bearers, and the inclusion of Mr. Roy and his protégé Anupam Hazra was not brought up specifically. Mr. Sinha had taken to twitter to express his discontent at being dropped publicly. “The issue was not specifically brought up, only a general resolve to work in unity was expressed,” said a source, who added that Mr. Shivprakash had however spoken to Mr. Sinha about his issues and calm matters down.

The BJP won an unprecedented 18 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 polls in West Bengal and has emerged as the real challenger to the ruling Trinamool Congress led by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.

Activist and former IAS officer Harsh Mander said on Thursday that the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) had raided two children’s homes in Delhi that he had been associated with in the past with the main aim of finding out if any of the residents had participated in the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Mr. Mander said the NCPCR raid on Thursday morning at Ummeed Aman Ghar and Khushi Rainbow Home was led by the Chairperson of the NCPCR.

“I am no longer formally associated with these homes...I visit them [the children] when I can, to assure myself about their welfare, speak to them about the world and leading a good life, and sing songs together. The NCPCR team in its ‘raids’ on the two homes had four central focuses. The most important was whether the children participated in the anti-CAA protests. The second focus was about my association with the homes,” he said in a statement.

He added that the other focuses of the raid were to find out if there was any foreign funding and if any Rohingya children were living at the homes.

“As it happens, Ummeed is entirely funded from Indian donors. Khushi also is largely supported by Indian donors, but has some foreign donors as well. The fourth question was whether we had given shelter to any Rohingya children. My colleagues said that for us, we don’t focus on the identity of any child; the only thing important for us is that she or he is homeless and in need of care and protection,” he said.

Mr. Mander said the Centre was using its agencies to carry out a campaign against those who participated in the anti-CAA protests from December 2019 till March this year.

“It has been made amply clear by the actions of the state machinery that I am one of those targeted,” he said.

He said the NCPCR had been used by the government to defame him and advance its campaign against protesters and dissenters.

“The NCPCR is India’s apex body for child rights, and is well within its rights to enquire about the welfare of children in any context. But the timing, mode and questions raised by them are unconventional and raise doubts about the motivation of the agency, whether it will be just one more willing tool for the witch-hunt that is ongoing against independent dissenters in India today,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ude7jw/article32745633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARSHMANDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/government-is-using-ncpcr-to-defame-me-says-harsh-mander/article32745634.ece
241,2020/10/01,Coronavirus | Bombay High Court asks Maharashtra if redressal system exists for COVID-19 patients,"The Court asked the State if it could take any action against private institutions that overcharged COVID-19 patients.

The Bombay High Court asked the Maharashtra government on Thursday if there existed a grievance redressal mechanism in the State for citizens to complain if they are overcharged for COVID-19 treatment at private hospitals and nursing homes.

A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation seeking that the State fix a maximum rate that private hospitals and nursing homes can charge for PPE kits.

In the previous hearing, the State had told the court that while it had fixed a charge limit for beds and ancillary items including PPE kits for 80% of beds, private hospitals and nursing homes were permitted to charge their own rates for the remaining 20% for treatment of both COVID and non COVID patients.

The State government had said at the time that it could not take over private hospitals completely.

On Thursday, however, petitioner Abhijeet Mangade urged the court to direct the State to fix the maximum limit for charges for PPE kits for the remaining beds as well.

The court then asked the State if it could take any action against private institutions that overcharged COVID-19 patients.

“Even if these are private hospitals, the State grants them registration. If needed, you can cancel their registration, then why can’t action be taken if they overcharge?” the bench said.

It however, added that cancelling registrations might prove counterproductive since the State was already facing a dearth of COVID-19 treatment facilities.

“In the state where I come from (West Bengal), there were similar complaints prior to COVID-19 of hospitals overcharging patients,” CJ Datta said.

“Thereafter, a statutory commission headed by a retired high court judge and some doctors was constituted. It is performing quite well,” he said.

The court suggested that the State think about a similar grievance redressal mechanism, or if a mechanism already existed, then to ensure its implementation, it said.

The court disposed of the PIL and thanked Mr. Mangade for “bringing such an important issue before the court”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/d1u2sy/article32743544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVIDBEDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-bombay-high-court-asks-maharashtra-if-redressal-system-exists-for-covid-19-patients/article32743545.ece

249,2020/10/01,"Rahul, Priyanka held on way to Hathras","An FIR has been registered against Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Vadra under sections 188, 269 and 270 of the IPC and section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, were arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police on Yamuna Expressway in Greater Noida on Thursday when they, along with hundreds of Congress workers, were going to Hathras to meet the family members of the gang rape victim. They were taken to the guest house of Buddha International Circuit for violating Section 144 and were later released on personal bonds.

Mr. Gandhi said he agreed to go alone if his visit violated Section 144. “But still they didn’t allow me and we were pushed around,” he said. When Mr. Gandhi started walking on foot, he was stopped by the Gautam Buddh Nagar police. In the pushing and shoving that ensued, Mr. Gandhi fell down and sustained bruises on his arm.

“Just now the police pushed me, lathi-charged me and threw me to the ground. I want to ask, if only the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) can walk in this country? Can’t a normal person walk? Can only Modi-Ji [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] walk in this country? Can’t a normal person walk?”asked Mr. Gandhi.

After that, he sat down on a dharna on the Expressway. Ajay Kumar Lallu, president of the State unit of the party, who continued with the sit-in protest with party workers after the Gandhis were taken away by the police, was also detained.

Reacting to the police action, Ms. Vadra told reporters that the government was insensitive and did not follow the rule of law. “The government has to take responsibility for the protection of women. You would remember that last year around this time, we were protesting against the Unnao rape victim,” she said.

She further asked, “You [the government] portrays itself as the saviour of Hindusim but what kind of religion is this that could not allow a father to perform the last rites of his daughter?”

Love Kumar, Additional Commissioner (Law and Order), Gautam Buddh Nagar first told The Hindu that the Congress leaders had been detained but later in the day clarified that technically it was an arrest for violating Section 144. “They were released after signing personal bonds. No witnesses were called for bail. So practically it was detention,” he said.

Mr. Kumar said around 150 Congress party workers were also arrested under Section 188 of the IPC for violating orders of a public official.

On the behaviour of the police, Mr. Kumar said they had to use mild force when party members were not allowing the car of the leaders to move.

He said the leaders were stopped after the Hathras District Magistrate issued an order whereby he asked the District Magistrates of U.P. to not allow any person to enter Hathras in view of the delicate law and order situation. “It is a kind of preventive measure. It meant that no political person could be allowed. So in this case, the number doesn’t matter,” he said.

FIR against Rahul, Priyanka

An FIR has been registered against Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Vadra under sections 188, 269 and 270 of the IPC and section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act in the Ecotech police station of Greater Noida, an official release said.

The FIR also names 153 Congressmen and 50 others for violating Section 144 and traffic rules. “The convoy of the leaders created a severe traffic jam on the Expressway and stopped the movement of ambulances and led to the accident of two cars which were part of the convoy,” the release said.

It said when the officials told the leaders that their walking on foot could cause loss of life and property, members of the convoy pushed the police officers and used abusive language.

It further said that after Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Vadra were arrested and taken to the guest house in Buddh International Circuit, State party president Ajay Kumar Lallu, president of Meerut division Virendra alias Guddu, district Congress president Manoj Chaudhary and 50 others damaged the official vehicle of SHO of Beta 2 and misbehaved with police officials, some of whom sustained injuries.

In this regard, another FIR under sections 332, 353, 427, 323, 354b, 147 and 148 has been registered.

BJP terms protest a photo-op

BJP spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh described the Congress protest as a “photo-op” by Mr. Gandhi and said nobody could be allowed to roam around on an expressway.

The Hathras administration also blocked the entry of the media to the Boolagarhi village on Thursday. Vikrant Vir, Superintendent of Police, Hathras, said Section 144 was already in place in the district and only the media was allowed entry inside the village on Wednesday. “Now that the three-member SIT (Special Investigation Team) is working in the village and there is COVID 19 scare in the area, we have blocked media entry to the village as well,” he added.

Mr. Vir said Hathras was a congested village, and with people not adhering to social distancing and other protocols, there was a real possibility of the virus spreading in the area. “Already two of our men have tested positive,” he told The Hindu.

The police used force to stop members of the Samajwadi Party, who tried to cross the police barricades and enter the village.

The incident led to protests in Aligarh, Agra and Moradabad, where sanitary workers came out on the streets and protested against the State government.

Several senior Congress leaders criticised the U.P. police for not allowing the Congress leaders to proceed to Hathras.

“U.P. police is a law into itself. None of the laws of the country seem to apply to it. What is wrong if the leaders of a political party protest against a gruesome crime and wish to visit the victim’s family?” asked former Union minister P. Chidambaram.

“History will not be forgiving if we were to remain indifferent to onslaughts upon our hardwon freedoms and dignity, including our right to protest against injustice. The Hathras tragedy should become the rallying point for political change,” said former law minister Ashwani Kumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/fuw59t/article32744531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAHUL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rahul-gandhi-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-arrested-on-way-to-hathras/article32739897.ece

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday described the gang rape, assault and murder of a 19-year-old woman in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, as “barbaric and shameful”.

“Have no words to condemn the barbaric & shameful incident at Hathras involving a young Dalit girl. My deepest condolences to the family..,” Ms. Banerjee said on social media.

She also added, “More shameful is the forceful cremation without the family’s presence or consent, exposing those who use slogans & lofty promises for votes”.

Speaking at an event in north Bengal later in the day, Ms. Banerjee said: “Look how Dalits are suffering today...During elections they visit Dalit homes, bring food from outside and say look we are having food here…and then they torment them…In UP today, how women are being burnt after being raped.”

She said once a crime is committed, the police must act. The police in West Bengal have done so. “What kind of an administration is that police are not taking action and burning the body?”

252,2020/10/01,BJP leader accused in Assam question paper leak case surrenders,"Former DIG said to be the kingpin is still absconding

A BJP leader accused in a sub-inspector recruitment scam has surrendered before the Assam police.

Diban Deka, who claimed to have served the BJP for 24 years, surrendered at the Patacharkuchi police station in the newly created Bajali district late on September 30 midnight. He was brought to Guwahati about 95 km southeast on October 1.

Mr. Deka was allegedly involved in the leaking of the question paper for a police sub-inspector job test that was scheduled on September 20. Hand-written copies of the leaked questions were used in a “written test” conducted for 50 candidates at a lodge in Guwahati on September 19.

Police said the BJP leader’s involvement in the scam came to light after a question paper was recovered from the lodge during a raid.

Former Deputy Inspector-General of Police Prasanta Kumar Dutta, the alleged kingpin of the scam, is still absconding.

In a Facebook post on September 24, the BJP leader said many “dishonest” police officers were involved in the scam. He also claimed that he had tipped off Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Pradeep Kumar, who resigned as the chairman of the State Level Police Recruitment Board (SLPRB) after the scam surfaced.

“The circle of Assam police has been torn in the question paper, many big people are involved. Many dishonest officers of Assam police are involved in this circle. There is also an officer involved, who has secretly killed many people,” he wrote.

Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta, the State’s Director-General of Police, denied his force’s involvement while Mr. Sonowal, in charge of the Home portfolio, asserted none would be spared if found responsible for the recruitment test scam.

“We have instituted an inquiry into the sub-inspector (unarmed branch) recruitment scam and the investing agency has been asked to conduct the inquiry impartially without any compromise,” he said.

The Opposition Congress on September 29 asked Mr. Sonowal to resign, owning moral responsibility. The party also requested Governor Jagdish Mukhi not to let Mr. Kumar resign as the SLPRB chief until the investigation is over.

Meanwhile, the Assam unit of the BJP suspended Mr. Deka from primary membership of the party. “His arrest followed an appeal by State party president Ranjeet Kumar Dass to the government for action against the guilty,” State unit general secretary and MLA Rajdeep Roy said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ccg47l/article32741185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI30-09-2020000056B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-leader-accused-in-assam-question-paper-leak-case-surrenders/article32738788.ece

256,2020/10/01,"BJP, Cong. in Gujarat begin screening candidates for bypolls","Eight Assembly seats in the State will go for voting on November 3.

With the announcement for bypolls in eight Assembly seats in Gujarat, both the BJP and the Congress have begun the exercise of selection of candidates for the seats, where polls have been necessitated by the defection of sitting legislators from the Congress to the ruling party earlier during the Rajya Sabha elections.

As per the schedule announced by the Election Commission of India (ECI), eight Assembly seats in the State will go for voting on November 3. Counting will be held on November 10. The seats to go for the bypolls are Dhari, Limbadi, Dangs, Kaprada, Karjan, Gadhda, Morbi and Abdasa.

The BJP is likely to field Congress defectors in 4 to 5 seats, while in the remaining seats, it is likely to field its own candidates. Many Congress legislators were promised tickets by the party when they joined the BJP, resigning from the Assembly in March and July this year during the Rajya Sabha polls.

The ruling party is likely to face opposition from its own cadre for importing leaders from the Opposition party and fielding them while neglecting loyal party leaders.

Earlier, two prominent leaders who had joined the BJP — Alpesh Thakor and Dhawal Jala — had lost the bypolls after defecting from the Congress and contesting on BJP tickets.

This will also be the first round of major elections after C.R. Paatil took over as the Gujarat BJP president. Earlier, Mr. Paatil had publicly expressed his displeasure over importing Congress leaders to the BJP, and had stated that the practice should stop.

On the Opposition party front, State Congress leaders, along with AICC in charge of the State, Rajeev Satav, held a review meeting to screen potential candidates for the eight seats. The party leaders have reportedly prepared a panel of 3-4 potential candidates for every seat. Candidates will be finalised after deliberations and consultation with local leaders and cadre.

Both parties have already appointed seat-wise observers and in-charge leaders.

Meanwhile, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will not be be any large scale campaigning through rallies and meetings. Both parties will go for digital campaigning using social media platforms and holding group meetings of 100-200 people.

There are 172 members in the 182-member House, of which 103 are from the BJP, 65 from Congress, two from the Bharatiya Tribal Party, one from the NCP and one Independent member.

Three families from Rajouri, whose kin were killed in an encounter on July 18 in south Kashmir’s Shopian, will be allowed to exhume their bodies, the police said on Wednesday.

“Since the DNA samples matched with the families, the three dead bodies will be exhumed and handed over to families after the due process of law,” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar told The Hindu.

The district administration of Rajouri has approached the families to begin the process.

“We have been called by the Rajouri administration for consultations. We demand immediate exhumation of bodies of our sons, compensation, and punishment to those involved in the fake encounter,” Muhammad Yousuf, father of one of the victims, said.

The graveyard where the bodies were buried after the encounter is located in north Kashmir’s Baramulla, far from civilian areas.

Three youth from the Pir Panjal valley’s Rajouri, identified as Abrar Ahmed (25), Imtiyaz Ahmed (20) and Mohammed Ibrar (16), were termed “unidentified militants” after a joint operation conducted by the police and the Army on July 18 in Shopian’s Amshipora area.

However, three families from Rajouri contested the security forces’ version, claiming all three to be labourers who went missing the day the encounter was carried out.

On September 25, the DNA samples of the slain youth was found to match that of the families.

The police have arrested two locals, including a Special Police Officer from Poonch, so far. They are accused of “tipping off about the presence of militants in the area”.

261,2020/10/01,"Activists take to streets, seek justice for Hathras rape victim","FIR registered against protesters; 32 men detained, women allowed to go, say police

Protests erupted across the national capital for the second consecutive day, following the death of the Hathras gangrape victim, with students, women activists and political outfits taking to the streets demanding justice for the 19-year-old woman.

Protests began outside Uttar Pradesh Bhawan here, demanding the resignation of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the rising atrocities against women and Dalits in the State. They said that the rape of the Hathras victim, a Dalit woman, was not an isolated incident and that under the regime of the BJP government life had turned into a nightmare for women and Dalits. The protesters also lashed out at the U.P. police for cremating the victim’s body despite her family wanting to perform the last rites.

Allege harassment

Members from the AISA, the AIPWA, the Indian Youth Congress, the Delhi Pradesh Mahila Congress and other activists had gathered at the venue. Some activists managed to stage a candle light vigil at India Gate later in the evening but were detained later. Members of the AISA and other activists alleged that the Delhi police detained women after 6 p.m. and that they were forcefully removed from the spot and that women protesters were harassed.

“When the protesters reached Uttar Pradesh Bhavan, the police, in their typical manner, started forcefully detaining peaceful protesters. All students and activists were forcefully detained and taken to Mandir Marg police station where the protests continued,” AISA Delhi State secretary Prasenjeet Kumar said.

“We demand the resignation of U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, arrest and punish the CM along with senior UP police and district administrators under the Prevention of Atrocities Act, for the secret midnight cremation of the Dalit rape victim of Hathras,” Mr. Kumar added.

Indian Youth Congress national president Srinivas B.V. said, it was unfortunate that the victim did not get a proper funeral, instead she only got humiliation. “This failure of not being able to give her safety while she was alive and neither a respectful demise shows the religious hypocrisy of the BJP government,” Mr. Srinivas said.

He added that those who want to raise the truth in Uttar Pradesh are being intimidated and killed. “Journalists are being killed because they reveal the truth of this jungle raj. This government is working against every section of our country whether it is youth, farmers, Dalits or women etc. The failure of law and order is a failure of Yogi Adityanath, so he should resign,” Mr. Srinivas said.

“As the protesters have violated orders under Section 144 CrPC in force and other laws regarding COVID-19, an FIR under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and other relevant sections of the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act has been registered against the protesters in both the instances, the police said.

Thirty-two male protesters have been detained for illegal protest near Mansingh Road, the police added.

“A few women protesters who were part of the protesting group were removed from the spot. The protesters belonged to the AISA and the Bhim Army.

269,2020/10/01,Mart for tribal people opens in Gudalur to market their produce,"Known as the “Tribal Mart,” the initiative by NAWA, a tribal rights and welfare NGO, aims at providing a platform for the tribal communities to market and sell their produce to the public.

A space for tribals to market and sell their produce has been opened by the Nilgiri Adivasi Welfare Association (NAWA) in Gudalur.

Known as the “Tribal Mart,” the initiative by NAWA, a tribal rights and welfare NGO, aims at providing a platform for the tribal communities to market and sell their produce to the public.

R. Vijaya, project coordinator of the NAWA Child Fund (India), said tribal communities living in Gudalur and Pandalur grew a variety of crops such as ginger, pepper and coffee. They also collected minor forest produce such as honey and koova leaves. “However, due to the cost associated with running a shop, most of them sell their produce for throwaway prices to merchants,” she said.

M. Alwas, secretary of NAWA, said most tribals got extremely unfair, low prices for their produce from merchants. “We wanted to give them not only the means to sell their vegetables and other products for a fair price, but also be able to buy essential items for a cheaper price from the store,” said Mr. Alwas.

“For instance, we are selling vegetables at a much lower price than in other shops, as we know that tribals were suffering from anaemia and malnutrition due to not having access to nutritious food,” he added.

The tribals, who wish to use the shop in Gudalur to sell their produce, could either sell it at competitive rates to NAWA or sell the products directly at the store and take home the profits, said Ms. Vijaya.

The Tribal Mart, which has been set up in the heart of Gudalur town, eventually hopes to expand to help hundreds of members of tribal communities. The building has been provided to NAWA by the Revenue Department.

“We are looking at opening small shops at 20 remote villages by identifying entrepreneurs within the communities and establishing shops where they can sell the produce to local residents,” said Mr. Alwas.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/vjuq04/article32747469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB02OTYTRIBAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mart-for-tribal-people-opens-in-gudalur-to-market-their-produce/article32747470.ece
270,2020/10/01,Murals painted to highlight effects of plastics on wildlife in Coonoor,"Volunteers, who have been working on cleaning up Coonoor town since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, are also beautifying the town and its surroundings and spreading the message about how litter affects birds and other wildlife.

The volunteers, most of whom returned to the Nilgiris from other cities during the pandemic, have been part of a number of clean-up drives in Coonoor. Recently, they also started working on murals around the town with an aim to sensitising residents and tourists to the biodiversity of the Nilgiris as well as the pressures faced by the wildlife due to littering.

Mukund Ravishankar, who painted one of the murals near Bedford in Coonoor, said that around 15-25 volunteers usually turned up to help paint the murals. “We have had volunteers as young as a two-year-old as well as people over 70,” said Mr. Ravishankar.

The mural being painted near Bedford showcases a few of the endemic species of birds seen around Coonoor, said Divya Menon, another volunteer who has been working with activists and NGOs in Coonoor over the last few months on various clean-up drives.

“Through this mural as well as others coming up across the town, we hope to bring attention to the fact that littering also affects wildlife, including birds,” said Ms. Menon. She expressed the hope that by involving many volunteers, the message to reduce the usage of plastic waste would spread among residents throughout the town.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/3olpkm/article32747459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB02OTYMURAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/murals-painted-to-highlight-effects-of-plastics-on-wildlife-in-coonoor/article32747460.ece
271,2020/10/01,Device designed to scare away wild animals,"It creates sound of magnitude 350 decibels.

A research group at Bannari Amman Institute of Technology, Sathyamangalam, has designed a device “anti crop raiding acoustic gun” that helps in driving away wild elephants along forest areas at Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.

Developed by ‘Technology for Wildlife’, comprising faculties, Sanjoy Deb, R. Ramkumar, R. Saravana Kumar and Project Assistant M. Gunasekaran, the device that creates 350 decibels was operated successfully at Iggalur village in Talavadi recently. The fully automated system creates safe ear splitting sound which drives away elephants. “The pocket-friendly system is capable of driving away elephants and other crop-raiding wild animals”, said the members. The system can be operated by placing it on the ground with a remote and also by holding it with hands. “On seeing the animals, the farmer has to switch on the system that generates sound”, they added.

Since human-elephant conflict has increased over the years, efforts are being taken to prevent loss of lives and also to reduce the conflicts. “The conflict management issue needs to be addressed from conservation, societal as well as from a technological point of view. Technology plays a role in generation of early elephant intrusion warning and driving away intruding elephants”, they added.

The high intelligence level and adaptive learning capability of elephants makes it highly difficult to configure a long lasting drive away technology and hence human intervention-based traditional drive away techniques such as beating drums, making a loud human noise, bursting firecrackers are widely accepted and applied till date.

Since ear splitting sound is the common tool to drive away elephants, technology is used here to create sound. “Creating a loud sound by humans to drive away elephants, particularly during night hours, is very difficult as well as risky”, they said and added that the new system is effective as farmers in the village had successfully chased away wild elephants.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/3jh3ol/article32747170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB02BANNARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/device-designed-to-scare-away-wild-animals/article32747171.ece

283,2020/10/01,MSMEs seek priority in getting new power connections,"The Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Associations has urged the State Government and the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to give priority to micro and small-scale industries when they apply for new power connection or additional load.

In a memorandum submitted to the government and the Tangedco on the draft Electricity Rules, the Federation said the State Government and Tangedco had already implemented several features of the draft Electricity Rules. Further, the MSMEs face challenges in getting the connection due to corruption in the system. The rules should specify that the new connections or additional load are provided within seven to 30 days. Otherwise, the officials concerned should be penalised.

If there are defects or damages to a meter, the consumer is blamed invariably. The Tangedco should identify neutral testing centres where the meters can be tested. Further, as in Gujarat, power consumed at night by industries should be at concessional tariff.

Any grievance related to electricity should be redressed in seven to 10 days rather than one to one-and-a half months as proposed in the Rules. The Rules should also define what ""quality"" power means as industries continue to face voltage fluctuations and drop in frequency, the federation said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/msmes-seek-priority-in-getting-new-power-connections/article32736306.ece
284,2020/10/01,No takers for Malliamman Durgham guavas,"Last year, a box of guava weighing 25 kg was sold between ₹ 600 and ₹ 720, whereas now a box of guava is available for ₹ 250, locals said.

Residents of Malliamman Durgham, a remote tribal settlement in Kadambur Hills, are a worried lot as their main source of annual income through sale of guava is hit due to COVID-19 pandemic.

The hamlet with a population of 450 is located nine km from a motorable road in Kadambur. Inscriptions on a hero stone in the settlement confirm that the region was under Vijayanagara Empire during the 14th century. The tribal residents cultivate finger millet (ragi), broad beans, tapioca and other millets on their small land holdings throughout the year, for their own needs. Their only source of income comes from the harvest of guava trees, raised on 120-acre patta and poramboke lands in the hamlet, from August to October. The hills also have jack fruit trees and the fruits are sold to traders in Kadambur .

The current guava season had turned disastrous for the people as they were unable to find traders who could buy the fruits.

“The fruits are not harvested and left to fall on the ground,” said M.K. Subramani (40). Last year, a box of guava weighing 25 kg was sold between ₹ 600 and ₹ 720, whereas now a box of guava is available for ₹ 250, but there are no takers. “Due to rains, the production is good in the current season. But pandemic prevented the traders from buying the fruits,” he added.

Recently, they started selling guava to traders at markets in Annur and Coimbatore. However, most of their earnings went towards transportation and other expenses.

“Only with this income, we buy household essentials, meet health care expenditure and celebrate festivals. Now, we will be forced to borrow money to meet our needs,” said Sasi, a resident of the hamlet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/yx1swn/article32736294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER01-MALLIAMMANDURGHAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/no-takers-for-malliamman-durgham-guavas/article32736295.ece

Residents of Eri Karai Road, near Mookaneri Lake, are a worried lot as rain water mixed with sewage stagnate on the road on Wednesday.

Rains in the past one week led to drains at Ramanathapuram getting clogged and overflowing causing inconvenience to residents and road-users. Rani, a resident, said that they are facing problems during the rainy season as the drainage channel was not desilted. Also, the capacity of the channel is not sufficient to hold the rain water, she said.

On Wednesday, stagnated sewage water on the road irked road-users who had to wade through the water while pedestrians faced more trouble in crossing the road. “Even before the start of the North-East monsoon, the situation is worse here”, said a two-wheeler rider. He wanted the channel to be desilted so that water does not flow onto the road.

286,2020/10/01,Ancient granary found at Kodumanal,"Four-month excavation at the village by the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology concludes

The four-month excavation at Kodumanal village by the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology concluded here on Wednesday, with a team unearthing a well-like granary in one of the quadrants in an area believed to be a habitation-cum-industrial site.

The team, led by J. Ranjith, Archaeology Officer, Chennai, and Project Director for Kodumanal Excavation, began the work on May 27. It comprised S. Nandakumar, Coordinator for the excavation from the Department of Archaeology, Coimbatore; T. Subramaniam, Assistant Director (Retired), Department of Archaeology; an expert coordinating the excavation with researchers; and 70 workers.

In the 45 quadrants that were dug, utensils, terracotta, copper and iron beads, semi-precious stones such as carnelian, quartz, and crystals were found. “Samples were sent for pollen analysis that will reveal evidence of past ecological and climate changes,” Mr. Ranjith told The Hindu. He said 500 kg of animal skeletons were found in the habitation mounds and 75 kg of skeletons would be sent for an analysis to identify the species. He said a rubble masonry wall measuring 25 metres was found and further analysis would reveal whether it had served as a waterway. Also, a four-course brick structure dating to the Sangam Era was found.

A well-like granary with sockets was found at a humus level of 4.25 metres in a quadrant. It could have been used to store grain. “Since its depth is over three metres, grain could have been stored for many persons,” said Mr. Subramaniam. Graffiti and copper and silver punch mark coins were also found at the site.

Of the 300 burial pits, 27 were opened. They revealed three types of burials: cairn circle, urn burial and urn burial with and without cists. Two burial pits had 42 ceremonial pots each, along with arrowheads, terracotta beads, iron swords and graffiti. Officials said documentation would be taken up in the coming days and a report would be submitted to the Department of Archaeology.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ancient-granary-found-at-kodumanal/article32736270.ece
287,2020/10/01,Indian Premier League | Mavi and Nagarkoti thriving in Cummins’ company,"Skipper Karthik delighted with Aussie pacer’s influence

Captain Dinesh Karthik is happy that experienced Australia speedster Pat Cummins is taking active interest in guiding the young Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) pacers.

While praising Shivam Mavi and Kamlesh Nagarkoti, who took two wickets apiece against Rajasthan Royals in KKR’s second consecutive victory on Wednesday, Karthik spoke about “extraordinary role model” Cummins’ influence on them.

“The fact that a player like Cummins is around is a confidence booster. The way he carries himself, his body language, it is a pleasure to have him around,” Karthik said at the post-match press conference.

Learning a lot

“The boys are learning a lot. He is interacting with all these guys not only on the field, but making a genuine effort off the field,” said Karthik.

The KKR skipper was delighted to see Mavi and Nagarkoti, who were part of India’s under-19 World Cup win in 2018, doing well.

“Just to see these boys out there playing and representing our franchise….we stuck with them [and] I am happy. I don’t want to put pressure on them by making them feel that they are the ones we are dependent on. If they keep chipping in and doing their bit, there are fabulous cricketers around who will make them look even better,” Karthik said.

He was also happy for spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who recovered from injury and has served KKR well so far, bowling his full quota of overs in the last two matches at a fine economy rate of 6.25 and taking three wickets in the process.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pb9txl/article32747850.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th02mav1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-leauge-mavi-and-nagarkoti-thriving-in-cummins-company/article32747852.ece
288,2020/10/01,Indian Premier Leauge| Strict action for bio-bubble violation,"Players face ouster, hefty fine for teams

Players face ouster from the tournament and their teams a hefty fine of ₹1 crore, besides deduction in points if they breach the bio-bubble that is in place for the IPL.

In a notification sent to all the eight participating franchises by the BCCI, a player will have to undergo a six-day quarantine for an “unauthorised departure” from the bubble.

It will be a one-match suspension if it is a second offence and a third violation will lead to his removal from the tournament with no replacement to be provided.

The fine

The players could be fined as much ₹60,000 approximately for not completing their daily health passport, not wearing GPS tracker and missing a scheduled COVID-19 test.

The same rules apply for family members and team officials.

All players and support staff are being tested every fifth day in the UAE.

The team officials too need to be very careful in ensuring that the strict bio-bubble is not breached.

If a franchise allows “any person into the bubble to interact with players/support staff”, it will have to pay a fine of ₹1 core at the first offence, a point will be deducted at the second offence and two points (equivalent to one win) for the third violation.

In an unlikely but possible scenario when a team is unable to field a playing XI as less than 12 players are available, the BCCI will try to reschedule and if that is not possible, the match would be deemed lost.

Teams also face a BCCI inquiry in case of repeated violations of health and safety calls put in place for the event taking place amid the pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/strict-action-for-bio-bubble-violation/article32747059.ece

Kolkata Knight Riders brought Rajasthan Royals, who had won both their games in Sharjah, crashing down to earth at the Dubai International Stadium on Wednesday. Responding to Knight Riders’ 174 for six, Royals finished with 137 for nine.

After Steve Smith fell early to Pat Cummins, Sanju Samson was snared by Shivam Mavi. The Kerala batsman failed to time his pull and ended up spooning the ball to Sunil Narine at midwicket.

In his next over, Mavi sent back Jos Buttler who went for a slash off a wider ball and was taken at short third-man by Varun Chakravarthy.

Kamlesh Nagarkoti took over from Mavi, dismissing Robin Uthappa and Riyan Parag cheaply to reduce Royals to 42 for five.

291,2020/10/01,"Indian Premier Leauge 2020 | Rayudu, Bravo back to boost CSK","SRH will hope its middle-order comes good

The return to fitness of Ambati Rayudu and Dwayne Bravo will boost an under-pressure Chennai Super Kings when it takes on Sunrisers Hyderabad here on Friday.

Rayudu, the hero of CSK’s victory against Mumbai Indians in the opening game, missed the next two matches because of a hamstring injury. Dwayne Bravo is yet to play a game, nursing an injury he picked up in the Caribbean Premier League.

“Rayudu and Bravo are available for selection,” CSK CEO K.S. Viswanathan said on Thursday.

While Rayudu looks set to replace an out-of-form Murali Vijay at the top, Bravo’s availability puts M.S. Dhoni in a dilemma. Sam Curran, the West Indian’s replacement thus far, has been one of CSK’s better performers and it remains to be seen if Dhoni can find a way to play both Bravo and Curran.

For Sunrisers’ it will be important to get the middle-order to click. Kashmiri lad Abdul Samad has shown promise, but Priyam Garg and Abhishek Sharma need to up their games.

While Deepak Chahar, Josh Hazlewood, Curran, Ravindra Jadeja and Piyush Chawla can prove more than a handful on the slow Dubai track, SRH has found its death-overs specialist in T.

292,2020/10/01,"Indian Premier League 2020 | Mumbai Indians showcases its might, crushes Kings to top table","After Rohit, Pollard and Hardik power the side to 191 for four, the bowlers help the defending champion complete a 48-run win in Abu Dhabi.

Rohit Sharma celebrated an Indian Premier League milestone by anchoring the Mumbai Indians innings. Big-hitters Kieron Pollard and Hardik Pandya built on it to set Kings XI Punjab a challenging target.

And then the MI bowling unit came to the party to ensure Rohit’s big moment ended with a comprehensive win for the defending champion.

After being asked to bat at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, Rohit started the innings two runs shy of becoming only the third batsman to tally 5,000 IPL runs. Not only did he cross it with an uppish drive off Mohammed Shami, he went from strength to strength.

Going berserk

Thanks to Rohit’s 45-ball 70 (8x4, 3x6) and a late flourish by the big-hitting duo of Pollard (47 n.o., 20b, 3x4, 4x6) and Hardik (30 n.o., 11b, 3x4, 2x6), the defending champion finished its essay at 191 for four.

The all-rounder alliance ensured that Kings XI’s death-over woes continued as MI plundered 89 runs off the last five overs.

Exposed early

Once Jasprit Bumrah breached Mayank Agarwal’s drive with his fierce pace in the Powerplay, Kings XI’s middle-order was exposed early.

When canny leggie Rahul Chahar forced K.L. Rahul into a mistake — he was bowled after an attempted paddle-sweep went wrong — the fizz was all but taken out of the chase.

Nicholas Pooran’s cameo did keep Kings XI’s hopes alive but James Pattinson’s variation of pace resulted in Pooran nicking one behind the stumps.

Eventually, Kings XI could only trudge along to 143 for eight, handing MI a comfortable 48-run win.

Shifting gears

Despite Rohit looking in good touch, early setbacks meant the MI captain had to bide his time. When Pollard walked in at 83 for three in the 14th over, the stage was set for Rohit and Pollard to cut loose.

Rohit started the leather-hunt by plundering twin fours and successive sixes off all-rounder James Neesham in the 16th over.

Relay catch

Rohit was brilliantly caught on the straight boundary off the first ball of the 17th over, with an off-balance Glenn Maxwell pouching the ball inches inside the rope at long-off and relaying it to Neesham before crossing the boundary.

Pollard and Hardik continued to hammer Kings XI, which miscalculated its bowling changes.

As if Neesham bowling the 16th and 18th overs wasn’t surprising enough, K. Gowtham was asked to bowl the last over. Hardik and Pollard made merry by tonking four sixes off it. The target was too steep for Rahul’s men.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/c557h8/article32749766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MIjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-kings-xi-punjab-vs-mumbai-indians-in-abu-dabhi/article32744588.ece
293,2020/10/01,Rayudu comeback big boost as CSK take on upbeat Sunrisers Hyderabad,"CSK and Sunrisers Hyderabad (since inception) have traditionally been two of the most balanced sides in most IPL editions.

Ambati Rayudu’s much-awaited comeback will be a shot in the arm for an under-pressure Chennai Super Kings when they take on Sunrisers Hyderabad, who have shown resilience after early setbacks, in the IPL here on Friday.

Rayudu, hero of CSK’s opening IPL victory against Mumbai Indians, missed out due to mild hamstring injury and Bravo has been also carrying a niggle of similar nature since the Caribbean Premier League where he didn’t bowl in the last two games.

“Both Rayudu and Bravo are available for selection,” CSK CEO KS Viswanathan told PTI on Thursday.

CSK and Sunrisers Hyderabad (since inception) have traditionally been two of the most balanced sides in most IPL editions but both have ensured scratchy starts this year, losing two of their first three games, primarily due to lack of balance in the middle-order.

Rayudu’s presence could well mean that he will replace an out-of-form Murali Vijay at the top alongside Shane Watson.

However, same cannot be said about DJ Bravo as it will then force Mahendra Singh Dhoni to tinker with the whole line-up.

Indian Premier League 2020 | Teams, schedules and statistics

But Kedar Jadhav’s poor form will certainly be a worry for Dhoni as there aren’t any ready replacement for the Maharashtra man, who hasn’t played any notable innings in near or distant past.

Bravo’s replacement Sam Curran has been one of CSK’s better performers in the first three games with good change-ups in pace and handy hitting.

In order to accommodate Bravo, Dhoni will either have to do away with opener Watson or seamer Josh Hazlewood, both of which looks non-negotiable on the Dubai track.

For Hyderabad, the presence of Kane Williamson made a fragile middle-order, full of Indian rookies, look more solid. Both Jonny Bairstow and David Warner also got their share of runs.

For SRH to succeed, they need to find that one dependable Indian big-hitter in the middle order in case their top three — Bairstow, Warner and Williamson fail in unison.

Kashmiri lad Abdul Samad has shows promise while both Priyam Garg and Abhishek Sharma need to up their game.

The bowling line-up is pretty even for both teams.

While Deepak Chahar, Hazlewood, Curran, Ravindra Jadeja and Piyush Chawla can be more than a handful on slow a Dubai track, SRH have found their death overs specialist in T Natarajan, who can be an ideal foil to world’s No.1 T20 bowler Rashid Khan.

Khan was brilliant against Delhi Capitals, claiming three wickets which also earned him the man of the match honours.

Teams (from):

Chennai Super Kings: MS Dhoni (captain, wk), M Vijay, Ambati Rayudu, Faf du Plessis, Shane Watson, Kedar Jadhav, Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Lungi Ngidi, Deepak Chahar, Piyush Chawla, Imran Tahir, Mitchell Santner, Josh Hazlewood, Shardul Thakur, Sam Curran, N Jagadeesan, KM Asif, Monu Kumar, R Sai Kishore, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Karn Sharma.

294,2020/10/01,"IPL 2020 | Shouldn’t get carried away by our youngsters’ performance, cautions Karthik","For Karthik, it is important that his youngsters don’t feel the extra pressure as they go deep into the tournament.

Kolkata Knight Riders skipper Dinesh Karthik finds it heartening that his team’s young guns have raised the bar with match-winning IPL performances but does not want to “get carried away” and put extra burden on the talented bunch as the tournament progresses.

Rising opener Shubman Gill performed well in both of KKR’s wins against Sunrisers Hyderabad (70 not out) and Rajasthan Royals (47) while his U-19 India teammates Shivam Mavi and Kamlesh Nagarkoti ran through Royals’ line-up.

The KKR skipper praised the trio but with a note of caution.

“Definitely, I think the fact that these young boys are doing well is very good. I don’t think we should get too carried away and, you know, make it a lot about them, just the fact that they’re doing well is very good,” Karthik said during the post-match virtual interaction here.

For Karthik, it is important that his youngsters don’t feel the extra pressure as they go deep into the tournament. “I don’t want to add pressure on them by making them feel that they are the ones that we are dependent on... There are fabulous cricketers around them as well who will play a role and make them look even better than what they are.”

Mavi grabbed the two big wickets of Jos Buttler and in-form Sanju Samson in his match-winning show, while Nagarkoti ripped the middle order with two wickets — Robin Uthappa and Riyan Parag — in four deliveries to derail the Royals in a tricky chase of 175.

At the 2018 auction, Nagarkoti, then 18, was snapped up for ₹3.2 crore, while Mavi, 19, commanded a price of ₹3 crore. But the young quicks endured some injury setbacks, especially Nagarkoti who was ruled out of two seasons but KKR continued to repose faith in them.

“I’ve been wanting to see them since the time they played the (2018 U-19) World Cup and now it’s just great to see them both on the field...To see these boys out there playing for us, representing our franchise, the fact that we’ve stuck with them and to see them out there makes us so happy. The fact that they’re bowling well and fielding well is a bonus,” Karthik said.

The youngsters now are in the elite company of world’s numero uno Test bowler Pat Cummins and Karthik believes it would make a “massive difference”.

“Cummins is an extraordinary role model for everybody. To have a player like him around is a confidence-booster because. He’s so good with the young kids and he’s just great to have around the team...I think the boys are learning a lot. The fact that he’s interacting with all these guys not only on-the-field but making a genuine effort off-the-field makes a massive difference.”

Karthik also hailed the team’s mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy who bagged two wickets to help KKR restrict the Royals for 137/9.

“The poor guy had a few injuries but I’m really happy to see him. He’s from Chennai so obviously I’m really fond of him for the fact that we are both playing together. He had a few doubts because of his injury but I’m just happy to see him out there,” Karthik said.

295,2020/10/01,IPL 2020 | Robin Uthappa spotted applying saliva on ball against KKR,"The incident happened right after the Rajasthan Royals batsman dropped a Sunil Narine skier in the fifth ball of the third over in the IPL clash in Dubai on Wednesday.

In a violation of the ICC’s COVID-19 protocol, India and Rajasthan Royals batsman Robin Uthappa was seen applying saliva on the ball while fielding against Kolkata Knight Riders in an IPL match here.

The incident happened right after Uthappa dropped a Sunil Narine skier in the fifth ball of the third over here on Wednesday. He was seen applying saliva after collecting the ball at the mid-on region and the video of it has since gone viral on social media.

The IPL has not issued any statement on the incident so far.

The ICC banned the use of saliva to shine the ball due to the COVID-19 pandemic in June this year.

“If a player does apply saliva to the ball, the umpires will manage the situation with some leniency during an initial period of adjustment for the players, but subsequent instances will result in the team receiving a warning,” it had stated in its Standard Operating Procedure for the game.

“A team can be issued up to two warnings per innings but repeated use of saliva on the ball will result in a 5-run penalty to the batting side. Whenever saliva is applied to the ball, the umpires will be instructed to clean the ball before play recommenced,” the ICC notification read.

296,2020/10/01,"‘It’s time to make way for the next generation,’ says Anita Ratnam","Performer Anita Ratnam is using a series of digital initiatives to channelise the creative energy of young dancers

Early April, when the fear of the pandemic was at its worst the world over, classical and contemporary dancer-choreographer-curator Anita R. Ratnam was busy ideating. She consulted Chitra Sundaram, the U.K.-based dance and theatre artiste, and ‘Boxed - Dance Deletes Distancing’ was born. Through Narthaki.com, her e-zine, Anita reached out to young dancers across the globe.

“It’s time for my generation to make way for the next. The digital age is so right for them; they are creative and tech-savvy. We should be supporting, encouraging, provoking, just being there for them. That was the impulse for ‘Boxed’,” says Anita.

She commissioned recordings of site-specific or prop-inspired works — two minutes of continuous movement — beginning with their chosen dance style and transitioning into free flow movements, along with the dancer’s explanation of the premise and the process. The soundscape was original, provided by Narthaki on request. The videos were shot on phone cameras from two angles. And the dancers did away with the traditional costume and jewellery and performed in lounge wear or street clothes.

“I wanted the young dancers to think differently. Many were challenged for the first time. We were surprised by some of the bold choices they made. They danced in bathtubs, on the beach, at doorways, on the stairs, near windows, on couches and chairs. They were prepared to take a risk, and that’s what we wanted. ‘Boxed’ is a tribute to the dancing body that refuses to stay still during this global unrest.”

The series created a buzz. The pandemic had locked dancers into physical spaces, confused and scared, this was a way to channel creative energy. Many applied, including a tour guide in Venice. The diva-storyteller had turned mentor and thought leader. Her sharp introduction to each episode brought out interesting dimensions of the performances. “I know how hard it is to shift from the classical style, where something is either right or wrong. When we mentored applicants, we told them, if you fall off a cliff, we will be there with the safety net.”

The response was overwhelming and the series went into eight editions, each with five dance presentations, followed by expert comments from senior artistes. There was a theatre edition, an American edition, and an Australian edition, with original music created for Narthaki by Vedanth Bharadwaj, Anil Srinivasan and Manjunath P.C. The project was backed by a team of technicians, comprising Masoom Parmar, Raksha Patel, Devansh Gandhi and Keerthi Kumar.

Celebrating women

Anita is following up ‘Boxed’ with ‘Devi Diaries’ for Navaratri. Through the month-long series, launched yesterday, she wants dancers to sing, dance, paint or tell a story about Devi. “Not just Hindu goddesses, but any woman they idolise. It could be Inanna from Mesopotamia, Rabia of Basra, goddesses from the Native American Inuit people, or your own family member,” explains Anita.

Another significant initiative through which she hopes to guide and groom Gen Next artistes is Neo-Narthaki. “The portal, launched recently, is run by a team of youngsters and has a voice of its own. We will have guest editors for every issue, and discussions can be about make-up, lighting, gender, sexuality, anything.”

Anita is also concerned about how to monetise artistes’ work. “Artistes need to be paid and in ‘Boxed’ I ensured everyone was. In India, the Goethe Institute, the British Council, the South Zone Cultural Centre, and Sangeet Natak Akademi support dance. The last two are headless, whom do we go to? We have to fend for ourselves. Older gurus are stuck, connectivity is poor in smaller towns. There is sadness and depression. How do we create a sense of continuity? The larger question is, do we have a community?”

The Chennai Margazhi Season going virtual is as good as being semi-cancelled, she says, and the line-up doesn’t include dance. “Why have sabhas not reached out for taped productions? They could ask the top 25 artistes to create exclusive content. Some U.S.-based organisations have done that. ABHAI is doing a series for young dancers in collaboration with Sangam Festival, New Jersey, sponsored by Sangam and Bala Devi Chandrasekhar.”

Someone who always speaks her mind on issues, especially of the art world, Anita says, “I put art in the centre of political discourse to see if I can change perception. I’ve been trolled, I don’t take anything personally. I am not worried any more.”

Mayors of the three municipal corporations here on Wednesday hit out at the Delhi government over claims of pending water bills of over ₹6,600 crore to the Delhi Jal Board.

They said that they would take action to recover outstanding property tax dues for Delhi government buildings. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation alone needs to get nearly ₹10,000 crore in property tax, Mayor Anamika Mithilesh alleged. With nearly ₹2,500 crore worth of property tax due in each of the corporation’s four zones, she said.

Properties of the Public Works Department, the Delhi Secretariat, Delhi Transco Limited, Delhi Jal Board among others have never given property tax to the corporation, alleged North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash.

Mr. Prakash also hit out at the Delhi government for charging exorbitant commercial rates on water bills from municipal facilities. For the North Corporation, he added that while the principal amount to be paid was only ₹261, the remaining ₹2,173 was penalty and interest. With regard to property tax, the Delhi Jal Board had to pay ₹216 crore and another ₹293 crore as road cutting cost was owed, he said.

East Mayor Nirmal Jain said that the DJB had owed the EDMC ₹175.52 crore, about which he had written to the Chief Minister and that the civic body’s water dues of ₹49 crore could be recovered from that amount.

Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chairperson Swati Maliwal on Wednesday wrote to the Chief Justice of India and judges of the Supreme Court demanding a High Court-monitored investigation of the Hathras gangrape incident, punitive action against erring officials and rigorous mechanisms to prevent such incidents.

Stating that “every possible fundamental and human rights of the victim was violated” by the Uttar Pradesh government and police force, Ms. Maliwal in her letter, urged the SC to take cognisance of the incident.

“Immediate suspension and punitive action against all erring police and administrative officials, including the officials who tried to cover-up the incident. Setting in place definite mechanisms to ensure that no other daughter has to suffer the same fate,” the letter demanded.

Ms. Maliwal said, “The Hathras gangrape and murder has once again exposed complete apathy and disregard our system shows towards its daughters and mothers. The victim was gangraped on September 14 and left to die in the fields with grievous injuries.”

“The Hathras victim was first raped by a few savages, and yesterday the whole system raped her. The whole episode is very painful,” said AAP supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet on Wednesday.

In another development, AAP MLA Ajay Dutt alleged that he was beaten up by three Delhi Police officers when he was enquiring about the Hathras victim on Tuesday at Safdarjung Hospital in the city. Addressing the media, the AAP MLA requested Home Minister Amit Shah that the three officers should be suspended. “I stood beside the Dalit family of Hathras. Is it a crime to be a Dalit?” he said.

Caste slurs

“The SHO, ACP and DCP all three manhandled and assaulted me at the Safdarjung Hospital. The DCP slapped me and kicked me as well. They also used caste slurs against me. The way the police behaved with an elected representative is unfortunate. The police also denied the family of the survivor to see the body and also did not allow them to participate in the last rites,” Mr. Dutt said.

AAP Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said that FIRs should be registered against these three police officers.

The Minister said that the Hathras case should be investigated by CBI in a time-bound manner.

“The trial of the case should be done by a fasttrackcourt and the accused should be convicted in six months. Also, ₹2 crore compensation should be given to the family of the victim,” Mr. Gautam said.

“Let’s stand together in solidarity to demand justice for Hathras gang-rape victim at 5 p.m., 2 October at India Gate. Be there,” the AAP said in a social media post.

“AIIMS which proactively gives admission to politicians and other influential people denied admission to the survivor. She was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital and yesterday she lost her life. The DCP manhandled Dutt who is an elected representative from Delhi. AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj also confirmed that the police used caste slurs against the elected representatives of Delhi. If the attitude of the police is such towards the elected representatives of Delhi then we can imagine what it could be with the common people,” Mr. Gautam said.

307,2020/10/01,Incentive for not burning stubble unviable: EPCA,"Report instead calls for giving them access to machines for straw management

The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, in a report submitted to the top court, said that giving an incentive of ₹100 per quintal of paddy to farmers for not burning stubble may not be a “viable” option.

“After deliberations it was found that inclusion of cost of stubble removal in MSP may not be a viable option. It has been agreed that any such incentive, if at all necessary, should be provided by the State government from their own budget,” the report said.

The report said that efforts should be to give them machines for straw management. “While there is a demand for additional funds to be paid to farmers for doing stubble management, but as this could be a perverse incentive it may not be advisable. Therefore, the funds already provided and the plan that exists should be implemented this season and in the coming period. The effort must be to ensure that farmers have easy and affordable access to the machines which allow them to do smart straw management,” the report further said.

In 2019, Haryana had given incentives of ₹1.63 crore to farmers for not burning stubble. Similarly, Punjab had given incentives of ₹28.51 crore to farmers.

But for this year, Punjab has sought funds from the Centre for the same.

Letter to govts.

The EPCA also wrote to Punjab and Haryana governments to issue clear directions to farmers to rent and use machines to combat stubble burning.

“We understand that Punjab has directed on August 14 that as government has provided 80% subsidy for machines for crop residue management, it is to be ensured that these machines are available to small and marginal farmers on priority basis and they will be charged on operational cost and no rental for the machines. We have also been told that the operational charges include source of power and operator wages etc., but not the cost of capital,” the letter to Chief Secretary of Punjab read.

But the EPCA said that this leaves the issue “very ambiguous” and possibly open to “misuse”. “The rate for rental, which is being waived off is not apparent; the cost of operation is also not laid down. We would urge you to ensure that this is done so that small and marginal farmers have access at affordable/free cost. We would also request you to make sure that this is given wide publicity so that farmers have information and assurance of this,” the letter further read.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/incentive-for-not-burning-stubble-unviable-epca/article32736625.ece

The latest seroprevalence survey has found that the percentage of people in the Capital, who have antibodies against COVID-19, has reduced from 28.7% in August to 25.1% in September, the Delhi High Court was informed on Wednesday.

“The seroprevalence has declined in North-West and Central districts but has increased in West, South, North-East and East districts,” said the report, which was submitted to the court.

“Seroprevalence was found to be more in women during the three rounds of sero surveillance and least in the age group of 18-49 years, as compared to the age group of those below 18 years and those who are above 50 years,” it added.

The conclusion of the sero surveillance-3 report is that there is a need to enhance the focus on sample representativeness of the survey in Central, North-West and north districts. A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad took note of the report filed by the Delhi government.

During the hearing, it also noted that despite directions to ramp up tests through RT PCR, it was not done adequately. “As against the testing capacity of 15,000 through RT PCR and other similar tests per day available in Delhi, the actual number of testing being conducted through this mode is still floating around 11,000 tests per day on an average,” the Bench said.

Farmers in some parts of Haryana staged a protest outside grains market under the aegis of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) against the alleged delay in procurement of paddy, besides in support of their demands, including to relax the moisture content limit.

The Centre had last week advanced Kharif paddy procurement, allowing operations to begin on September 26, instead of the scheduled date of October 1, but the farmers in Haryana alleged that the procurement was yet to begin. Additional Chief Secretary, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, P.K. Das, did not respond to repeated calls and messages for a response on the matter.

BKU spokesperson Rakesh Bains claimed that farmers in Kurukshetra, Karnal, Kaithal, Ambala and Panchkula staged protests outside the grains market and blocked roads.

Demands

BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni told The Hindu over the phone that the farmers were demanding to raise the moisture content limit for procurement to 22%. “Since the farmers do not have space to dry paddy before bringing it to the grains market, we have been demanding that the government procure those with higher moisture content. We are also ready for price cut as per the moisture content. The government has agreed to marginally increase the moisture content limit to 18-19% from the 17%, but it is not enough,” said Mr. Charuni, who also addressed the agitating farmers at Pehowa and Ismailabad in Kurukshetra.

He also demanded that the farmers be allowed to bring their crops to the market as per their convenience soon after it is harvested, instead of the government imposing a schedule on them. He alleged that the government has yet to start the procurement, causing resentment among the farmers.

Sandeep Beniwal, commission agent, Samalkha New Grains Market, said a few farmers gathered to stage a protest in the mandi against the delay in procurement. “Though farmers are bringing the paddy for the past few days, the procurement is yet to begin,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/haryana-farmers-protest-outside-markets/article32736573.ece

316,2020/10/01,‘We will make liquid solution to stop stubble burning’,"Project cost is less than ₹20 lakh: Kejriwal

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced that the Delhi government would start the process of preparing a fermented liquid solution to be sprayed on 800 hectares of land in the city where farmers practise stubble burning.

At a press briefing, Mr. Kejriwal said all arrangements for spraying the solution on farm fields will be made by the Delhi government and will be provided free of cost to farmers. The process will be executed under the guidance of the Pusa Research Institute and the cost of the implementation of the entire project is less than ₹20 lakh. A few days ago, he had also written to the Centre over the issue of stubble burning, which poses a health hazard for people in parts of North India, particularly Delhi.

“October is starting tomorrow. North India in its entirety is troubled by the smoke that covers the belt due to crop stubble burning every year. While Delhi and other cities have to suffer from the smoke, the farmers who are forced to burn the stubble and their villages have to suffer the most. Every responsible government must devise alternate systems for their farmers so that they are not forced to burn the stubble,” he said.

“This year, the Pusa Research Institute has presented a very cheap alternate solution to the problem of stubble burning. They have formulated capsules, four capsules can be mixed with a liquid solution prepared by jaggery and gram flour and can be sprayed to cover one hectare of land,” Mr. Kejriwal said. The mixture, he said, when sprayed, softens hard straw and turns it into manure.

This is a cheap alternative to stubble burning for farmers who usually start preparing for the next sowing season around October 15 every year. This schedule, he said, had also left no time for the Delhi government to have distributed capsules to farmers, training them and converting these capsules into a spray was a time-consuming process. So the Delhi government had decided to prepare the mixture itself under the guidance of the Pusa Research Institute starting October 5, he said.

“There are around 800 hectares of land in Delhi where non-basmati rice is grown following which stubble is collected and burned. The Delhi government will be starting the process of preparing this liquid solution by October 5 which will hopefully be completed by October 12-13 after which we will visit the farmers with the solution to be sprayed on their farmlands. The Delhi government will itself set up the entire spraying system through tractors on fields, free of cost for the farmers.After around 15-20 days, the stubble will soften and will convert into manure,” he also said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/we-will-make-liquid-solution-to-stop-stubble-burning/article32736548.ece
317,2020/10/01,Police building on Yamuna floodplains: NGT rejects plea,"The National Green Tribunal (NGT) rejected a plea moved by the Delhi Police seeking permission to construct accommodation facilities for police trainees on the Yamuna floodplains.

Noting a report furnished by a principal committee that made recommendations in favour of the Delhi Police, a Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said that the project could not be permitted due to the current state of the floodplains.

“Having regard to the pitiable condition of river Yamuna, in spite of repeated directions of this Tribunal, what is necessary is stringent compliance of directions and not relaxation thereof. Activities which may be beneficial for the rejuvenation of the river like bio-diversity parks, artificial wetlands, afforestation and so on, are required and not the constructions.”

“Idea of semi-permanent or temporary construction for utilisation of hte police officials may not be a very germane idea. Such requirement is not temporary. Alternatives for viable permanent constructions may need to be explored,” the Bench added.

Referring to previous judgments of the Tribunal, the Bench observed, “The present project is right on the floodplains and has potential for generating solid waste and sewage unlike the project that was earlier allowed.”

In 2015, the green panel had prohibited construction activity on the demarcated floodplain area and directed a principal committee to identify all existing structures which fall on the demarcated area.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/police-building-on-yamuna-floodplains-ngt-rejects-plea/article32736539.ece

319,2020/10/01,SCR freight loading improves,"All commodities, except coal, witness higher figures

the South Central Railway (SCR) combined freight loading has surpassed the loading during the same period last year with an overall loading of 7.56 MT in September when compared to 7.51 MT in September last year despite the pandemic continuing to rage across the country.

Growth rebound in loading has been across the spectrum with all commodities witnessing higher loading levels except coal. The policy initiatives for cement sector like relaxations in the mini rake loading, tariff concession for long-lead traffic and relaxing train load benefits norms among others – combined with the active canvassing by oficial teams has contributed to an increase by 29% to 2.2 MT in September 2020 compared to 1.7 MT last year.

Foodgrains loading witnessed a growth of 15% and loading of fertilizers increased by 23.5% to 0.68 MT compared to 0.55 MT last year. Similar growth trends were also witnessed in other commodities with 26% growth in loading of raw material commodities for steel plants - 0.24 MT this year and 0.19 MT earlier, 14% growth in loading of petroleum products (0.032 MT & 0.028 MT), 22% growth in containers loading (0.11 MT & 0.09 MT) and 9% growth in loading of other commodities (0.36 MT & 0.33 MT), said general manager Gajanan Mallya on Thursday.

Average speed of freight trains was drastically improved by 97%, from 26 kmph to 51 kmph. In fact, the SCR recorded the third best average speed in the freight train movements across the Indian Railways, said chief PRO Ch. Rakesh.

320,2020/10/01,Youth does his bit for Kondapochammasagar oustees,"Moved by their plight at the rehab colony, Aditya raises funds through Instagram to provide them kits

Kinnelli Chamanti had new guests on Sunday morning at her doorstep. She was handed over a packet consisting of one litre oil, one kilogram of red gram, one kilo sugar, one kilogram salt, 200 grams chilly powder, 100 grams turmeric powder, 100 grams pickle, one washing soap, one bath soap and one dishwash soap. Her family migrated to the city for a living and were not extended the double bedroom house or package. This was great relief for Chamanti and others residing in the double bedroom houses at Mulugu.

All of them are from Bahilampur and Mamidyala — two villages that submerged in Kondapochammasagar reservoir. They were forcibly shifted to these double bedroom houses on a temporary basis as the villages got submerged in Kondapochammasagar reservoir. Some of them are single women, while some others had migrated to urban areas to make a living. But all of them are from these villages and lived there, had assets like lands and houses. Their lands and houses were acquired by the government for the project with a promise to rehabilitate and resettle them. After being forced out of the village they are facing plenty of problems and most important, they are unable to find work.

At this juncture, a team of eight members led by Mangavelli Sai Aditya reached them and handed over the kit. But Aditya is not an employee, he is a student! Except Bilu and Praveen in the team, all others — Sindhu, Dimple, Aishwarya, Aayushi, Nikhil and Gaurav — are students. Recently, Aditya visited the Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Colony at Tunkibollaram and the double bedroom houses at Mulugu where the oustees have been provided accommodation by the government. Their plight moved him and so he decided to help them. He raised funds on Instagram platform with the tag: ‘Fund raising campaign to support Kondapochamma oustees: September 21 – Septmber 25.’

The response from the public was encouraging and he was able to generate a fund of ₹ 1.5 lakh. Aditya and his team extended assistance to the needy, including about 30 families residing in sheds at R&R Colony. “I felt bad about their plight and decided to help them after visiting this area. They are in a pathetic condition,” Aditya told The Hindu.

“Our entire time is being spent moving around revenue offices and courts to get justice and we are unable to do any work. The assistance extended by Adtiya and his team is timely and helpful,” D.

321,2020/10/01,GHMC election will be fought on ‘truth and lies’: BJP,"Save the twin cities from TRS, says MLC

The forthcoming GHMC elections would be between “ truth and lies” as the ruling TRS had totally failed, at the State and GHMC levels, to improve basic amenities to people, forgetting the promises made during elections, said Telangana BJP Hyderabad president and MLC N. Ramchander Rao on Thursday.

“The TRS leaders led by KCR and KTR had made tall promises before the municipal elections last time and they are repeating the same false assurances like providing free two-bedroom houses for all. The loss of three lives in recent rains, water-logged roads and submerged colonies were a stark proof of the administration failure,” he said.

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Rao urged people to “liberate and save Hyderabad city” from the clutches of the TRS and MIM “which had utterly neglected overall development of the capital”. He was of the opinion that people, particularly those in the capital, had realised the folly of continuously supporting TRS and were now determined to “teach a lesson to the ruling party and its ally, Majlis”.

The BJP was for building civic infrastructure like new flyovers and bridges. However, laying foundation stone for proposed projects alone did not constitute “development”.

The MLC was confident of his party putting up a good show this time and capturing the mayor post as “people no longer want to be deceived by TRS leaders”. He accused ruling party corporators of having become “notorious for their brazen acts” over the last few years.

The educated youth too were frustrated owing to lack of employment opportunities in the government. “The government’s claim of creating one lakh jobs is a total lie as the figures do not match with those provided by the TS Public Service Commission,” he said. Employees and teachers too were unhappy over non-fulfilment of their demands like pay revision and increase of retirement age, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/save-the-twin-cities-from-trs-says-mlc/article32746643.ece
322,2020/10/01,AP cadre IFS officer ends life in Hyderabad,"A senior Indian Forest Service officer allotted to Andhra Pradesh cadre was found dead in his apartment complex in Nagole on Thursday.

V Bhaskara Ramana Murthy (59) committed suicide by jumping from the ninth floor of his apartment in the wee hours, police said.

The 1987 batch IFS officer had been working as Principal Chief Conservator of Forests for Coastal Zone Management from Aranya Bhavan in Guntur.

Ramana Murthy, who is survived by wife and two daughters, had taken leave from work in the third week of July for personal reasons, inspector V Ashok Reddy said. He was set to retire from service in August next year.

After having dinner with his wife and daughter Manvitha, he went to bed around 9.30 p.m on Wednesday.

""Around 1.30 a.m. on Thursday, security guard Appa Rao heard a sound near ‘A’ block and went to check. He found Ramana Murthy lying in a pool of blood and alerted his wife V Jyothi,"" Mr. Reddy said.

The reason for his extreme step was yet to be known, the inspector said. A case under Section 174 CrPC (suspicious death) was registered.

Ms. Jyothi’s brother Prabhakar said there were no family or financial issues. “I don’t know about issues at work. He never discussed them with us,” he said.

He said they performed ‘Muhurtham puja’ for his younger daughter’s wedding on Wednesday.

“Though we were not in regular touch since the State bifurcation, he called me a couple of times for official work. Ramana was a jovial person and never hurt anyone even unintentionally,” a senior IFS officer said.

323,2020/10/01,TS seeks ₹500 cr. to improve NH-65 stretch,"KTR writes to Union Minister Gadkari

Telangana government wants the Centre to sanction ₹500 crore to resolve the infrastructure problems on the Hyderabad-Vijayawada section of National Highway-65.

In a letter to Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, the State Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao said the NH segment of about 25 kms on Hyderabad-Vijayawada section of NH-65 has several problems like at-level junctions, inadequate land capacity and absence of service roads for local traffic.

The State Public Works Department (PWD) has prepared a detailed project report (DPR) for about ₹500 crore for construction of flyovers, grade separators, service roads and augmentation of lane capacity. Stating this, Mr. Rao requested the Union Minister to sanction the funds in the current year's annual plan (2020-21) and help resolve the problems on the NH section.

Mr. Rao mentioned that the Telangana government has taken up many infrastructure projects and planning many more with a view to decongest traffic in the city, with an emphasis on providing good access to national highways from Hyderabad.

He said “We are grateful to you for sanctioning four urban projects and of which three are in good progress and works on Amberpet flyover will commence shortly.” Telangana government is bearing the entire cost of land acquisition and utility shifting in these projects, he said in the letter.

The Minister said progressive policies of the State government and the strategic location and connectivity advantage that Hyderabad enjoyed have made the city a preferred destination for pharma, aerospace, defense, and other manufacturing industries.

327,2020/10/01,Twitter files counter affidavit in PIL plea over objectionable content,"User assumes responsibility for the content, says the company

Micro-blogging system and social networking platform, Twitter Incorporation, said that a PIL petition over Islamophobic posts was not maintainable against it as it was not amenable to the jurisdiction of Telangana High Court.

In a counter affidavit filed in Telangana HC hearing the PIL plea, the social networking platform company said that it was incorporated under the laws of the United States of America. With a registered office at San Francisco, California, USA, the company operates Twitter social media platform for ‘self-expression of its users to communicate and stay connected through small messages of 280 characters or less (Tweet). Sometimes, the posts may contain pictures or videos’.

It said the company would not author or post the tweets/hashtags about which objections were raised by the petitioner in the PIL plea. “It is the user of the platform (twitter) who is the author and publisher of the tweet/hashtag,” the company said. Before availing Twitter services, every user contractually agrees to the ‘terms of service’ which are publicly available at www.twitter.com/en/tos , the company said.

Under this, the user assumes responsibility for the content posted by them. Describing the PIL petition as ‘premature’, it said the petitioner failed to approach the authorities concerned established by law to investigate into the objectionable posts and content.

The petitioner did not lodge any complaint against the company in any police station. No First Information Report too was issued. The petitioner failed to avail such alternate and more efficacious remedy, the company stated. The counter affidavit said the company was an ‘intermediary’ as per Information Technology (IT) Act-2020. The act of posting tweets, including ones with hashtags, is under the control of the authors and originators of the tweets, it said.

The company claimed that legal liability for electronic documents, content or information commonly exchanged over Internet is governed by IT Act. Under this Act, attribution of liability for any electronic record is on the ‘originator’. The liability cannot be shifted onto an intermediary like the company, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/twitter-files-counter-affidavit-in-pil-plea-over-objectionable-content/article32745817.ece
328,2020/10/01,‘Pass resolution against farmer bills in Assembly’,"Chief Minister is backing Modi, alleges TPCC chief

Questioning the TRS government’s sincerity on their opposition to the three farmers bills, the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy asked Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to convene a special session of the Assembly and pass a unanimous resolution against the bills.

Speaking to reporters through online platform Zoom, he asked the Chief Minister to pass new laws in the State Legislature under Article 254(2) of the Constitution to override the Central laws.

He said Mr. Rao should emulate the Congress-ruled States in opposing the new Central laws. “The Chief Minister is still backing Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the bills, and his opposition to the bills is just a lip service,” he alleged.

Mr. Reddy announced that the Congress would organise massive protests before the statues of Mahatma Gandhi and district Collectorates on Friday as part of nationwide agitation demanding withdrawal of controversial agricultural laws.

Besides holding protests at all district headquarters on October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), he said that the Congress would also launch a signature campaign against the new laws. He said that the party plans to collect nearly two crore signatures from across the country and they would be submitted to President Ramnath Kovind by Congress president Sonia Gandhi on November 14.

The TPCC chief said that all the three new laws do not favour farmers but were brought in for corporate houses like Adanis, Ambanis, Walmart, Amazon, among others.

Recalling the crop loan waiver from the Congress-led UPA government, he said the party always stood for farmers. He also reminded the crop loan waiver by the Congress government in the united Andhra Pradesh. Further, he said farmers were also given interest-free loans, quality and free power, besides ensuring Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce.

AICC secretary and former MLA Ch. Vamshichand Reddy said that the TRS has no right to seek votes of graduates and teachers and appealed to those sections to be aware of another round of empty promises to be made to them.

He said the TRS cannot ask votes in the Graduate MLC elections given its insensitivity towards the students, graduates, employees and teachers for ‘deceiving’ them throughout these six years.

“They all played a vital role in Telangana agitation and the TRS government just ignored them after making huge promises once it came to power,” he said.

How can the TRS leaders now visit the districts for voter enrolment of graduates, he asked and said the educated sections should question the government’s unfulfilled promises when the TRS leaders visit them for enrolment.

“On behalf of the Congress party, I request all the graduates of Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy, Mahabubnagar, Nalgonda, Warangal and Khammam to get enrolled in the membership programme to teach a lesson to the TRS government,” he said.

Mr. Vamshichand accused the government of remaining silent for years on PRC, IR, DA, transfers and promotions, and cutting the salaries and pensions of the employees during the lockdown.

He alleged that 7,000 field assistants, 27,000 sweepers in schools and colleges, engineers of Mission Bhagheeratha, contract and outsourcing employees in GHMC and universities were fired by the government.

On the other hand, notifications for Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 were not issued during the last six years. More than 30,000 teacher posts have been lying vacant and not a single recruitment has taken place in colleges and universities, he said.

He demanded the government to recruit 1.5 lakhs vacant posts and an additional 1.2 lakh posts created through retirements.

Ramchander Rao and others informed that resorting to ballot papers/boxes will not only be a logistical challenge but will require more personnel, hence reducing the chances of social distancing while also making it tough for sanitisation.

In case of EVM, voters can be provided with gloves and hand sanitisers can be kept near the machine for use as soon as the poll symbol button is pressed. The Election Commission has decided to make use of EVMs for Bihar elections as it is more convenient and easier to operate unlike ballot papers/boxes where a lot of paperwork is to be handled.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/8ltd02/article32736382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy30Evm,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bjp-demands-evms-for-ghmc-polls/article32736378.ece
333,2020/10/01,Govt. mulls resumption of non-COVID services at Gandhi Hospital,"More workforce, better infra needed to handle additional load, say officials

Intense discussions are under way to resume non-COVID services at Gandhi Hospital. However, critical infrastructure such as diagnostic machines, pending for the past many years, has to be provided if both COVID and non-COVID patients are to be served at the State-run hospital.

When cases started to increase in March, Health Minister Eatala Rajender issued directions to turn Gandhi Hospital into an exclusive COVID treatment facility. Since then, it has been attending only patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus.

Junior doctors’ plea

Junior doctors studying at Gandhi Medical College met the Health Minister on Tuesday stating that since only coronavirus patients are admitted there, post graduate students of some specialisations are not able to pursue their academic work.

Responding to the concern, Mr Rajender has directed officials to resume non-COVID services at Gandhi Hospital and other health facilities. However, sources said that separate workforce, infrastructure, and other resources have to be provided to make the transition smooth.

“Of the two CT Scan machines at the hospital, one is 15 years old. If it breaks down, it cannot be repaired. The machine used for COVID patients cannot be used for other patients.

Defunct MRI machine

Besides, the lone MRI scanning machine is defunct. So we need at least one more CT Scan machine if COVID and non-COVID services are to be extended simultaneously. If MRI machines are also provided, it would be of great help,” hospital sources said. In effect, it would be akin to running two hospitals parallelly from one location.

The CT Scan machine is used for COVID patients to know if virus has attacked lungs, and the extent of the damage. Before March, around 100 people used to be examined daily using the diagnostic machines.

Besides, separate workforce which includes doctors, nurses, para-medical staff, patient care providers and others, will be needed for the two categories of patients. It was learnt that the Health Minister has met senior officials from the hospital administration for a discussion on how to move ahead with the plan.

Currently, around 600 COVID patients are undergoing treatment at Gandhi. The patient load has to come down substantially if the existing workforce is to be distributed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/govt-mulls-resumption-of-non-covid-services-at-gandhi-hospital/article32736364.ece

335,2020/10/01,"Ideal body weight of Indian men now 65 kg, women 55 kg","Decade-old standard of 60 kg and 50 kg revised; adult age put at 19-39 years

ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) has redefined the ideal or reference Indian adult man and woman with regard to age to 19-39 years instead of 20-39 years. The body weight has been put at 65 kg for males and 55 kg for females while earlier, it was 60 kg and 50 kg respectively, which are a decade old.

This is based on the latest nationally representative data sourced from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4, 2015-16), National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB, 2015-16), the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2006-07) and the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP 2015) to “derive acceptable reference body weight values through the lifespan”.

In the ‘Recommended Dietary Allowances’ and ‘Nutrient Requirements’ report prepared by NIN, the city-based nodal agency for recommending dietary allowances and nutrient requirements for Indians, includes Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Tolerable Upper Limits of nutrients for the first time.

Dietary intake

Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) are daily dietary nutrient intake levels which would be sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy individuals while EARs are the average daily nutrient intake levels of the population.

The cereal-legume-milk composition of the diet for a moderately active man has been improved to 3:1:2.5 as compared to the earlier 11:1:3 within a given low cost window to meet daily protein requirements.

Visible fat intake for sedentary, moderate and heavy activity has been set at 25 gm, 30 gm and 40 gm a day for adult man and 20 gm, 25 gm and 30 gm a day for adult women as against the single level recommended earlier.

For the first time, fiber based on energy intake was recommended and the level of about 40 gm/2000 kcal has been considered as safe intake.

For carbohydrates, the EAR has been set at 100 gm/day for ages 1 and above with a RDA of 130 gm/day.

With regard to sodium due to emerging concerns on prevalence of hypertension a safe intake of 2000 mg/day which amounts to 5 gm/day of salt is recommended; while an intake of 3,510 mg/day is recommended for potassium.

It has also recommended a minimum of 400 gm/day of fruits and vegetables to obtain sufficient amounts of antioxidant nutrients such as beta-carotene, Vitamin C and certain non nutrients like polyphenols and flavonoids which may protect against chronic diseases. This should be complemented with sufficient amounts of vegetable oil so as to obtain Vitamin E.

Water required from beverages for adult man ranges from 32-58 ml per kg body mass and for woman, it ranges from 27-52 ml per kg body mass, with sedentary working group at lower end and the heavy working group at higher end of the range.

Children’s needs

For children, the requirement is greater than 60 ml per kg body mass and for adolescent boys it ranges from 47-60 ml per kg body mass, while, for girls it is 39-49 ml per kg body mass.

For pregnant woman, based on the working intensity, the water required from beverages ranges from 2.1 to 3.2 litres per day. For old-age, irrespective of gender, the present consensus for water requirement from beverages is 33 ml per kg body mass for sedentary activity and 38 ml per kg body mass for moderate activity, the report said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/7uqgwt/article32738300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY30-BODYWEIGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ideal-body-weight-of-indian-men-now-65-kg-women-55-kg/article32736299.ece
336,2020/10/01,From Saptak’s treasure trove,"The Ahmedabad-based cultural organisation’s podcasts allow listeners a deeper dive into classical music

Forty years ago, a group of classical music connoisseurs, led by tabla exponent Nandan Mehta and his sitarist wife Manju, set up a school for music in Ahmedabad called Saptak. They next began hosting a three-day annual music festival, which grew in both popularity and duration, and is today a 13-day long event. Another significant initiative was the setting up of the Saptak Archives in 2004 to digitise recordings of Saptak concerts and also to acquire rare classical music recordings.

In a recent lockdown treat, Saptak introduced podcasts and already, there are 40 podcasts covering Hindustani music, semi-classical and Carnatic-Hindustani jugalbandis. Says vocalist and contributor Srijan Deshpande, “Today the problem is not access to classical music online, it is knowing what to listen to, and what to listen for. Basically, we are trying to create a gateway to classical music.”

The music selected for the podcasts is not confined to the Saptak archives (managed by Prafull Anubhai, and comprising more than 20,000 recordings). About 30 minutes long, the podcasts are available on the Saptak YouTube channel and have been put together by a team of about 10 musician-scholars.

One of most recent podcasts was on the sitar — Manju Mehta introduced four main styles of playing the instrument — Etawah gharana, Maihar Senia, Vishnupur and Senia Jaipur.

Sitar playing techniques

Etawah gharana or Imdadkhani gharana was introduced by veteran sitariya Pt. Arvind Parikh. The right hand techniques of Hindustani instrumentalists (as opposed to Carnatic exponents) were highly evolved — the recordings of Ustad Imdad Khan in raga Bihag and of Ustad Inayat Khan in raga Bhairavi exhibited this.

Ustad Vilayat Khan, apart from modifying the sitar and eliminating the kharaj wire required for dhrupad-style aalap, focussed more on left-hand movements, which is today called the gayaki ang. However, it would be more precise to call it the khayal/ thumri ang. Ustad Vilayat Khan’s recording of raga Bahar showcases his fantastic tayyari; raga Sanjh Saravalli, composed by the legendary musician shows his immense creativity.

Pt. Ravi Shankar

The Maihar Senia ‘beenkar’ gharana, established by Ustad Allaudin Khan, rightly focused on Pt. Ravi Shankar. The maestro’s disciple Shubhendra Rao, who presented the episode, explained the gharana’s link with Tansen through his daughter, who was married into a family of beenkars. Shubhendra spoke of the emphasis of the dhrupad style of aalap and jod, and then chose to focus on Pt. Ravi Shankar’s raga Parameshwari. This recording is one of his best. Episodes on the other two sitar gharanas are awaited.

Influences of gharanas

Srijan Deshpande’s three-part focus on Ustad Amir Khan (episodes 2, 13 and 30) fascinatingly traces the main musical influences on this trend-setting singer. Part 1 opens with a recording of Ustad Wahid Khan of the Kirana gharana whose ati vilambit aalap style was adopted, and prolonged further, by Ustad Amir Khan. Ustad Wahid Khan etches raga Darbari with masterly, confident strokes within the first minute or so; nowadays some vocalists tend to linger on three to four notes initially, and the contours of the raga remain obscure.

Part 2 showcases the influence of sargam (used extensively in the Carnatic vocal tradition) on Ustad Aman Ali Khan of the Bhendi Bazar gharana, which was adopted by Ustad Amir Khan. The raga is Hansadhwani, a Carnatic raga, which admirably lends itself to demonstrate this; sadly the recording quality is not good. Ustad Amir Khan’s recording of the same raga is of a private baithak; inspiring him to render some truly magnificent music.

Part 3 is devoted to Ustad Amir Khan’s amazingly intricate taans, which were inspired by Indore-based Ustad Rajab Ali Khan. Sadly, there are no available recordings of this master at his peak, so Srijan plays the recording of his disciple Ganpatrao Dewaskar in raga Adana.

Three-part Malhar series

Jaipur-Atrauli vocalist Radhika Joshi’s three-part series on Malhars (episodes 8, 19 and 33) unusually divides the Malhars into three periods — Megh, Shudh Malhar and Gaud Malhar pre-15th century; 15th-18th century includes Mian Malhar, Sur, Meera and Nat Malhars (the composition by Pt. Dinkar Kaikini in Nat Malhar is a rare gem); and 19th century till date includes Tilak, Sorath, Chaya and Anand Malhars (all combinations of Malhar with other ragas)

In episode 31, vocalist Nilesh Dhakras skilfully shows how a change of tempo in the same composition in raga Sohni sung by Pt. Gajananbua Joshi and his disciple, Pt. Ulhas Kashalkar, brings in virtually a new feeling to the raga. Sarod artiste Sohan Nilkanth brilliantly presents Ustad Ali Akbar Khan’s composed Chandranandan and Gauri Manjari ragas, in three episodes.

North-South jugalbandis by dhrupad exponents Gundecha Brothers and Carnatic vocalists Malladi Brothers (raga Kiravani) and the U.S.-based young singers Lalit Subramaniam (disciple of Tiruvarur S. Girish and Neyveli Santhanagopalan) and Jai Sovani (disciple of Aarti Ankalikar) singing ragas Subhapantuvarali and Lalit are other interesting episodes. The podcasts are a true treat for music lovers.

337,2020/10/01,Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s open-air Margazhi festival,"Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in Chennai will hold its Margazhi programme on the Rajaji Vidyashram grounds

Newtone Studio in Kilpauk is an important place in the history of Madras. Kannamba’s dance for M.K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar’s song ‘Unaikkandu Mayangada’ in the 1941 film Ashok Kumar (music by vocalist Alathur Sivasubramania Iyer; lyrics Papanasam Sivan) was shot in a single night at Newtone. Some scenes of M.S. Subbulakshmi’s Meera were filmed here, and the song ‘Kaatrinile varum geetham’ was also recorded here. Anandan (of Film News), the chronicler of Tamil film history, learnt photography at this studio. And now this venue is on the verge of creating history again.

From studio to school

In the place where the studio functioned, we today have a school, Bhavan’s Rajaji Vidyashram. This year, the school campus is going to be the outdoors venue for the Margazhi festival of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (BVB).

S. Sowmya

This is especially significant because Chennai’s much-awaited December festival has moved online this year because of Covid-19.

“Every year we have a programme that runs for eight weeks. This year, we obviously cannot have something on that scale. But we hit upon the idea of an open-air event in the Rajaji Vidyashram campus,” says K.N. Ramaswamy, director, BVB, Chennai.

N. Ravi, chairman of the Chennai Kendra, says, “Artistes felt live concerts were better than virtual ones. If the weather permits, the end of November should be fine for the festival. Other things being equal, if at all a gathering is permitted, then our programme will give both artistes and rasikas a feel of the season. The programmes will be open to all. The playground is large, and we can have sufficient space between chairs.”

Ramaswamy explains the safety measures that will be put in place. “The playground can hold 3,000 people, but we anticipate an audience of about 800. We will place six screens on the grounds, so that people can even watch from inside their cars. Bhavan’s has an excellent reputation for its audio standards, and we will maintain that. The place will be sanitised everyday. We will check everyone’s temperature at the gate and they will be given a mask and a cap. We will arrange buses to pick up and drop those who want to attend the concerts. There will be three pick-up points — near our Kendra in Mylapore, near Narada Gana Sabha, and near Ice House in Triplicane. If there is a demand from the Adyar area, we could have an additional pick-up point near the Sivaji Ganesan Memorial. We also plan to give the audience a hygienically prepared, packed dinner.”

Says Nalli Kuppuswami Chetti, vice-chairman, BVB, Chennai, who is on the board of many sabhas, “None of the sabhas in the city has planned a live programme this year, because no one has so much open space at their disposal. Bhavan’s is a unique attempt.”

“The last time we made use of the school ground for a public function was in September 1983, when the school, which used to be called Rajaji Centenary Vidyalaya, was renamed Bhavan’s Rajaji Vidyashram. Chief minister M.G. Ramachandran, President Zail Singh, and a host of other dignitaries attended the event. M.S. Subbulakshmi sang the invocation song and I had the honour of playing the sruti box for her,” recalls Ramaswamy.

Artistes on board

Singer Pantula Rama, who lives in Visakhapatnam, is one of the artistes participating in BVB’s open-air festival. “Since all precautions are being taken, we should be safe,” she says. “People are depressed being indoors. I think they would like to attend an open-air kutcheri.”

Pantula Rama

O.S. Arun, who is scheduled to perform a bhajan concert, says, “I do miss live concerts. The element of unpredictability is the charm of a live performance. I am looking forward to the Bhavan’s concert.”

Bhavan’s initiative is supported by South Zone Cultural Centre, and Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit is expected to inaugurate the fest, which will run from November 28 to December 19 and include religious discourses as well. What happens if the government allows only a small audience? “In that case, we will organise some sort of pre-registration format,” says Ravi.

338,2020/10/01,"The wandering singer of Kerala, who impressed Saint Tyagaraja","Shatkala Govinda Marar, who had perfected the art of singing in six tempos, travelled with his tambura, ganjira and edakka

The compositions of legendary vaggeyakaras were disseminated mainly through their disciples. This was true of the Music Trinity as well as of Swati Tirunal, whose court entertained musicians of all genres. But this is not true of their contemporary, Shatkala Govinda Marar. He was an ascetic and an itinerant musician, who lived a life singing about the glories of god, and he did not have a retinue of disciples following him.

The two-storey building adjacent to the Sree Perumthrikkovil temple in Ramamangalam, Ernakulam district, is a fitting memorial to the saint-musician. The recently renovated mansion, which belongs to Shatkala Govinda Marar Smaraka Kala Samithy, will complete four decades on October 8.

Born in 1798 at Ramamangalam in a traditional Marar family, it was Govinda Marar’s duty to perform kottippadiseva, singing and beating on the edakka drum at the sopanam, the steps leading to the sanctum of the temple in Ramamangalam. Not only is the Ramamangalam bani of Sopana Sangeetham unique, the percussion ensemble, Parishavadyam, and the rare instrument, Kudukka Vina, also have their origin here.

Over the years, it became Marar’s passion to sing in all temples. He visited all the temples in the state of Travancore, armed with his seven-stringed tambura, a ganjira and an edakka.

The Shatkala Govinda Marar Smaraka Samithy at Ramamangalam

Meeting Swati Tirunal

His travels took him to Swati Tirunal, a great patron of music. The king was fascinated by Marar’s devotion and singing style. Swati Tirunal was well-versed in Sopana Sangeetham, since his family had many famous Kathakali playwrights (the libretto in Kathakali is rendered in Sopana ragas). Also, scholars have pointed out that all Manipravala compositions of Swati Tirunal are in the Sopana style.

The king asked Marar to sing the Sopana raga Puraneeru. Marar rendered a kirtana, strumming the tambura strings with his right hand and beating the ganjira, held by his toes, with his left hand. Impressed by his flawless singing and dexterity, the king presented Marar with a pennant, which he tied to his tambura. It stayed there till his death.

Marar then reached Tyagaraja’s abode as an emissary of King Swati Tirunal, apparently to invite him to the palace, but the composer of ‘Nidhichala sukhama’ gently refused. Marar, however, was allowed to sing before the composer and his disciples — a rare privilege.

He sprang a surprise by singing the eighth Ashtapadi, ‘Chandanacharchitha Neela Kale Bharam’, in Pantuvarali raga in six tempos — hitherto unheard of in the history of music. This fetched him the sobriquet ‘Shatkala.’ Impressed by his prowess, Tyagaraja asked his disciples to sing his composition ‘Entharo mahanubhavulu’ in Sri ragam for Marar.

Then, Marar continued his musical journey, till he breathed his last at Pandharpur in 1843.

There were many attempts to salvage Marar’s compositions, but Trikampuram Krishnankutty Marar’s efforts alone bore fruit, that too towards the end his life. A descendant from the matrilineal side of Govinda Marar’s family, Krishnankutty Marar was an authority on the temple arts of Kerala. It was only a little before his death in 2013 that he could collect the five compositions of Govinda Marar, traditionally known as ‘Shatkala Govinda Pancharatnam,’ the authenticity of which was confirmed by scholars like Kavalam Narayana Panicker.

As part of its initiatives to popularise these compositions, Kala Samithy presented them in Mohiniyattom, choreographed by Jayaprabha Menon from the Kavalam School of dance.

Composed in Sopana ragas, all but one is set to Chembada. The first one ‘Ksheerasagara vasa,’ in Kedaragowla, is an invocation to Narasimha, the presiding deity of Ramamangalam temple. The second one is a Devi stuti, ‘Balachandra vibhushini’, in Arabhi. Surprisingly, the goddess mentioned in the composition is the one at Kanyakubja in Uttar Pradesh. The third and fourth are in praise of Siva — ‘Palayamam parvatheesa’ in Anandabhairavi and ‘Thungapingajadha’ in Bhupalam. The latter depicts Siva in his tandava mood and has been set to tripuda tala, perhaps to highlight the tandava aspect.

The fifth song is ‘Sree Kurumbepaahi’ in Mohanam on the deity at Kuzhuppallikkavu temple near Ramamangalam. The day is not far when Shatkala Govinda Marar’s Pancharatnam will also be heard on the concert stage.

339,2020/10/01,Tributes to guru Rajee Narayan,"Rajee Narayan, who passed away recently, guided her students in both art and life

Rajee Narayan, consummate natyacharya and founder-director of Nritya Geetanjali, was adored by her disciples based across the world and admired by contemporary gurus and senior dancers.

“Simple and unassuming, she was active even at the age of 90. I was fortunate to partake in the silver and golden jubilee events of her institution and also her 80th birthday celebration. She was a great inspiration. We lived in close vicinity in Mumbai and interacted closely over the past several decades,” says veteran guru K. Kalyanasundaram.

Apart from Bharatanatyam, Rajee Narayan gave classes in Carnatic music and nattuvangam as well as in dance make-up and hairstyling. She has composed and published over 200 songs including varnams.

Ready to adapt

“She taught us all aspects of the art form. Every moment spent with her was a learning experience. It would be difficult to find another guru like her. She was traditional yet modern in her outlook, willing to adapt to the changing times,” says her senior disciple Jaishree Rao.

Jaishree recalls her last interaction with her guru in August. “She was anxious about her ailing son, Shyam Sundar, who was in hospital, but her eyes were alert. I felt that it would be my last performance in her presence.”

After her son’s demise on September 1, she moved to Delhi to stay with her foster daughter and grand niece, Mala Murali, where she died 25 days later.

“I was 13 when I came to live with amma in Mumbai after the demise of my mother. She was a strict disciplinarian but caring and loving too,” says Mala.

“Sometimes she would wake up in the middle of the night to write new compositions. Amma guided every student individually. She was also interested in gaining knowledge about electronics, medicine and learning languages such as Urdu and Persian,” she recalls.

Rajee Narayan guided her students beyond music and dance, teaching them social skills and etiquette. She made sure there was food for students who came for class straight from college. And she would take her students to restaurants for a treat after performances.

“She had a lovely collection of saris and would happily give them away if any student liked one,” says Mala. “My childhood memories are mostly of this dance class, where my sister and I spent a lot of time,” says student Priya Natesh.

Jaya Ramamurthy is proud to have been associated with Rajee Narayan for the past 45 years. “She was my music guru and I used to sing for all her dance programmes. She was adept at writing lyrics, composing music, singing and choreography,” she says.

“A musicologist, researcher and scholar, Rajee mami was a compassionate and soft-spoken person,” says Gayatri Subramaniam, recalling the 15 years spent with her guru.

Like the perfect guru, Rajee Narayan stays embodied in her students.

340,2020/10/01,When a musician met the Mahatma,"What is needed for art is to have the heart for it, said Bapu to Dilip Kumar Roy, who sang for him in a Pune hospital

Mahadev Desai, secretary to Mahatma Gandhi from 1917, when he first met Bapu, until his death in 1942, kept a diary of daily happenings in the life of the Mahatma. It is not a simple mention of events but a detailed record of every word spoken and written by Gandhi. One such entry in the diary shows what music meant to the man who led India’s freedom struggle.

Mahatma Gandhi with Mahadev Desai

Well-known musician Dilip Kumar Roy visited Bapu on February 2, 1924 at the Sasoon Hospital, Pune, where he had been shifted from Yerwada jail for an emergency appendix surgery. Desai notes in the diary: “It must have been about 8 p.m. when Sri Dilip Kumar Roy came. He had brought with him his sitar. Sitting on the sofa opposite Gandhi’s bed he sang, ‘Deendayala Gopala Hari.’

Moving rendition

The devotion in the bhajan and the soulful voice of the singer lifted the spirits of everyone around. Roy then sang the popular Meera bhajan, ‘Chakar Rakhoji’.

Desai writes: “All of us were ‘dancing on Love’s blue rill’ — that was the effect the performance produced. Profound silence prevailed for a while. Dilip Kumar Roy then touched a contentious topic. “I feel Mahatmaji, he said, ‘that our beautiful music has been sadly neglected in our schools and colleges.’”

“It has — unfortunately,” Bapu agreed. “I have always said so.”

“I am very glad to hear this, Mahatmaji,” said Roy, “because, to be frank, I was under the impression that art has no place in the gospel of your austere life. I had often pictured you as a dread saint who was positively against music.”

“Against music! I...!” exclaimed Bapu. “Well, I know,” he added , “there are so many superstitions rife about me that it has now become almost impossible for me to overtake those who have been spreading them.”

“I feel so relieved, Mahatmaji,” Roy laughed, “but may not your asceticism be somewhat responsible for such popular misconceptions? People would find it difficult to reconcile asceticism with art.”

“But I do maintain that asceticism is the greatest of all arts,” said Bapu. “And to think that I should be dubbed an enemy to an art like music because I favour asceticism! I, who cannot even conceive of the evolution of India’s religious life without her music! But indeed, I fail to see anything that passes much for art in these days. What is needed for art is to have the heart for it, not any intimate knowledge of technique or training. In my ashram we do not have art on the walls. Nature suffices for my inspiration.”

Roy agreed: “Yes. What man in his senses will claim that the artist’s handiwork is greater than life’s?”

Then Bapu, changing the Gita’s aphorism ‘Yogah Karmasu Kaushalam’ (yoga is skill in action), concluded: “Life must immensely exceed all the arts put together. For what is this hot house art plant of yours without the life, soul and background of a steady worthy life? What after all does that art amount to which all the time stultifies life instead of elevating it? No. Art has a place in life, but art is not life. Life, on the contrary, is art. Art should be subservient to life. It should act as its handmaid. Not master. It should be alive in life and the universe.”

Letter to Tagore

Art is life, said the Mahatma and earlier, in a letter to Rabindranath Tagore, he had suggested giving both Hindustani and Western classical music a place in Shantiniketan along with Bengali music.

Mahatma Gandhi with Rabindranath Tagore at Shantiniketan

When Gandhi was in South Africa, he had started evening prayers in the ashram. That collection of bhajans was published under the name, ‘Nitivam Kavyo.’ His idea of music was also connected to spirituality. In this context, he wrote a letter to Pt. Narayan Moreshwar Khare (music teacher at Satyagraha Ashram, Sabarmati) on October 7, 1924. “I have gradually come to look upon music as a means of spiritual development. Please try your best to see that all of us sing our Bhajans with a correct understanding of the sense.”

At Ahmedabad, in his address to Young India, on April 15, 1926 he had stated, “If many more people send their children to the music class it will be part of their contribution to national uplift.” According to the Mahatma: “In true music, there is no place for communal differences and hostility.”

What does it mean to have integrity in the entertainment industry? What are the skills needed to succeed? How does one take risks in this industry?

These are just some of the topics Grammy and Latin Grammy winning producer and engineer Gael Hedding will be touching upon during a masterclass presented by Furtados School of Music titled ‘Success in entertainment: The unwritten protocol’, on October 3.

Speaking over a video call, Hedding, who is presently director of Berklee Abu Dhabi, says: “I touch upon these subjects through stories that I experienced personally: anecdotes relating to my experience working with artistes such as Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, and Justin Timberlake. That happened for me early on and I was in the deep end of the pool. I have had the opportunity now, over almost a decade, to reflect on them and sort of condense them into a one-hour talk. So, that it gives people an insight on what it means to actually be in the industry.”

While now, musicians can sing and mix their songs at home thanks to access to technology and software, Hedding has a few do’s and don’ts for people to keep in mind.

He says, “We are in the age of information. But the question is, how do you access it in the most organised and reliable way? Of course, you can buy a laptop, get the software and go on YouTube and learn a lot of that stuff. But how do you make sure that you have true knowledge of how the industry functions? How do you create and build the right relationships? I think that is where institutions come into play. It offers that opportunity to access information in a much more condensed way as well as the opportunity to network.

“For the don’ts, the main one is don’t take the time, effort and energy that should be put in for success, for granted. You have to be passionate, and your passion needs to be in the right place like the everyday parts: the sitting down and forcing yourself to write a song and trying to find out how to cue the snare drum with the kick. If your mind is on the red carpet rather than on the rhyme, it is in the wrong place.”

On whether he thinks there is any particular trend in music right now, Hedding says, “The years of trends and formulas in music are long gone. I think the trend is that people are finding their community and their niche and they are consuming content within that. To an artiste, I would say go and find your niche rather than finding the trend like ‘Oh, everybody is doing reggaeton fusion’, which we could say was a trend until not long ago. An example of finding your audience would be music for video games. A lot of people wouldn't imagine that there is a huge community of people consuming, listening, composing, and being part of ecosystems around music for video games.”

The free masterclass will be held from 6 pm to 7 pm on the Furtados School of Music Facebook page.

Berklee Abu Dhabi will launch several online courses on October 4 such as digital music production, songwriting essentials and a masterclass in film scoring.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/kmx40n/article32742483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01bgmGaelHedding2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/gael-hedding-to-conduct-an-online-masterclass-this-saturday/article32742484.ece
342,2020/10/01,"‘To me, the sahitya of a kriti is a prayer,’ says Charulatha Ramanujam","Violinist Charulatha Ramanujam has the skill and attitude of an able accompanist

Despite never having lived in Chennai, violinist Charulatha Ramanujam has made a distinct name for herself among noted Carnatic musicians. Says senior vocalist S. Sowmya , “Exemplary musicianship apart, Charulatha is also soft-spoken and cheerful. I would have had to entirely forget about presenting Ghanta on stage at The Music Academy had she said she could not play.”

Well-known vocalist N. Vijay Siva says, “With her complete involvement with the music on stage, she helps the main artiste deliver with natural ease, sending a positive signal ‘I am with you.’

From the late maestro Sripada Pinakapani to today’s finest, Charulatha has accompanied a galaxy of musicians.

Charulatha grew up in Tirupati in a large joint family where music was ever present. At home, her grandmother would routinely sing with Charulatha’s aunt accompanying her on the violin. Charulatha’s father K. Rangaswamy was a self-taught singer in a style reminiscent of Dr. S. Ramanathan. “Appa had gleaned a lot on the music and kutcheri paddhathi by attending live concerts,” says Charulatha.

Rigorous practice

Charulatha began learning the violin at the age of seven from Pudukottai Ramanathan, a student of Kumbakonam Rajamanickam Pillai, and was under his tutelage for 12 years. She would wake up at 3 a.m. daily and practice for 3-4 hours. She did her B.A. in English Literature, was married soon after, and moved to Bengaluru. There, she took lessons from her husband’s teacher, Anoor S. Ramakrishna.

Charulatha had hardly been to any live concerts until she began performing herself. In Bengaluru, she got access to a large collection of yesteryear recordings. She began playing alongside those for practice, the home becoming her concert hall. She learned a lot both in terms of musicality and accompaniment. “When someone sings well, I enjoy soaking in that music and being in that moment for just a little while longer.”

A year later, the couple moved to Hubli. Charulatha began playing at the local sabha for artistes visiting from Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kerala, including Rajkumar Bharathi, T.R. Subramaniam, Rudrapatnam Brothers and Hyderabad Sisters. Many of these artistes then started calling her for concerts in Chennai and other cities. Hubli being more attuned to Hindustani music, she began learning its rudiments from Shripati Padigar, a direct disciple of Pt. Bhimsen Joshi. She provides sangat for some local artistes. “It made me more aware of sruti suddham and sowkhyam.”

After Anoor Ramakrishna’s passing, Charulatha came under the tutelage of veteran R.K. Srikantan. “His was impeccable patantaram. His notation had every minute facet within it.” As she did not have a violin guide after Pudukottai Ramanathan, she also worked on adapting her playing technique for the various styles of music she heard. “I experimented with each finger to see what produced the best possible effect.”

She ponders over the meaning of every kriti, taking pains to find the meaning of unknown words. “I think the sahitya helps in our own upliftment. To me, it is a prayer.” Guru Neela Ramgopal, who guides Charulatha currently, says, “Charulatha’s knowledge of Telugu, Sanskrit and Kannada helps her play faithfully to the lyrics. I consult her on the Telugu script.”

Charulatha has given vocal performances too — not formally trained, it was an organic extension. Bangalore S. Shankar, whom she has accompanied for years, says, “Being a good vocalist herself, she knows the requirements of a vocalist. She does not overdo or overshadow the main artiste or demand to raise the volume of the microphone.”

Unobstrusive accompanist

Charulatha’s accompanying etiquette includes patience at the start of an alapana. “Many ragas have similar phrases. I prefer to wait a bit, perhaps on the shadjam, to allow the artiste to collect his/ her thoughts.” Neela Ramgopal says, “Many violinists complete the vocalist’s phrases, Charulatha will not. She is an unobtrusive accompanist.”

Charulatha had played for the late Suguna Purushothaman on many occasions. In 2007, Suguna asked Charulatha to accompany her at The Music Academy for a Pallavi in the 128 aksharam simhanandana talam. Asked about her preparation, Charulatha says, “She gave me a CD. With nobody to give talam during practice, I realised that by being attentive to the words, their melody, the spacing and the number of aksharams per word, I could play it.” She has since accompanied other singers for several challenging pallavis.

Charulatha teaches vocal music and the violin but looks at herself as a perennial student.

343,2020/10/01,A Kerala family’s weekend play dates,"Every Sunday, from April 5, 2020 Sudhakaran Vellangallore has been writing, directing, acting, staging and uploading plays

Every Sunday, around 6 pm, the hall on the first floor of Sudhakaran Vellangallore’s house in Vellangallore near Thrissur transforms into a stage. Sudhakaran and his wife, Bindu, stage a play, that he has written and directed. Their son, Amal Shankar, records it on a mobile phone. The play is then uploaded on his Facebook page, and shared on various WhatsApp groups either the same day or the next morning.

This has been the family’s routine since April 5, 2020. They have not missed a Sunday. Sudhakaran has been active in the theatre scene in Thrissur since 2014 when he joined the city-based theatre company, Rangachetana for a workshop. Organised in association with the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi, the sessions were held on Sundays.

“All of us had been part of Rangachetana,” says 58-year-old Sudhakaran. “A play used to be staged every Sunday. We would get a vibrant audience too. From 2014, until lockdown we had staged 463 plays.”

Lockdown brought all activities to a halt and ET Varghese, founder of Rangachetana, asked members to device ways of keeping this Sunday tradition alive.

A few people have been able to stage plays off and on, but Sudhakaran has been consistent. “I managed to stage a play every Sunday, and now the tally of plays staged, under the aegis of Rangachetana, is at 489. I have not missed a single Sunday,” he says proudly. Posting these on social media was the only way of keeping the movement going and reaching plays to a maximum number of people.

Sudhakaran, is a postal assistant with the Postal Department office in nearby Irinjalakuda. He has written and directed plays for local drama clubs and other organisations.

Since this is a weekly affair, and he has to balance his work commitments and cannot spend too much time on the script.

Nevertheless, stories from literature, current affairs, contemporary events — political and social — figure in Sudhakaran’s plays. Even the people he meets inspire him. “It could be anything. A colleague once told me how her husband expects her to hand over her salary to him, which she does. It struck me, and I wrote a play about it,” he says.

Once he got started, he realised he needed a bigger cast. “Getting people from outside was not an option, I roped in my wife, Bindu,” he says. Bindu, a pharmacist, has no acting experience whatsoever but sportingly, decided to go along. “I think seeing how involved I was, she wanted to help me.”

All hands on deck

Apart from the couple, a neighbour’s six-year-old, Ashwana Parvathy, acted in two plays. ‘Technical’ support comes from their son, Amal Shankar, an undergraduate student, who handles recording and music.

“We discuss the story, the action; then get down to acting and recording it. Time is of essence, if we have to keep the momentum, we have to work like this,” Sudhakaran says.

All plays are kept at under 10 minutes as longer plays take more time to upload. He prepares the stage with curtains (for backdrop) and lights that he has specially bought for the purpose, as also make-up and a stand for the mobile phone.

ET Varghese, or Varghese Master as he is called, regularly enquires about the Sunday performance. “He calls every Saturday to ask if a play is ready.”

Sudhakaran finds pleasure in his Sunday activity, “When I was in high school, drama was the primary source of entertainment. We have walked and cycled great distances to watch a play...it is a part of my life. It is a powerful medium and has been in the forefront of Kerala’s cultural life. It has been integral to political movements and most importantly, it resonates with people.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/pxrgoj/article32744014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPVELLANGALLORES,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/every-sunday-from-april-5-2020-sudhakaran-vellangallore-has-been-writing-directing-acting-staging-and-uploading-plays/article32744015.ece
344,2020/10/01,"Mohit Takalkar’s play ‘The Colour of Loss’, to be staged digitally on October 2","The play originally written by Booker prize winner Han Kang is a story of finding beauty in loss

Directed by Mohit Takalkar and translated by Deborah Smith, the play The Colour of Loss is set to première digitally on October 2 with Front & Centre, Paytm Insider’s theatre initiative. The story depicts a complex mixture of pain, loss, despair, compassion, love, empathy, and forgiveness.

The Colour of Loss highlights what it means to remember someone who is no more. The play, adapted from Booker prize-winner Han Kang’s book The While Book, , is a story of finding beauty in loss. The author reminisces with her sister through the lens of all things white — breast milk, swaddling bands, the baby’s rice cake-coloured skin, white dog, and sugar cubes.

The play is performed by Mrinmayee Godbole, Ipshita, Manasi Bhawalkar, and Dipti Mahadev as a part of the contemporary theatre group - Aasakta. The Colour of Loss is shot at THE BOX brought together by Ashish Mehta (production design), Saurabh Bhalerao (music), Vikrant Thakar (lighting design), Rashmi Rode (makeup), Hrishikesh Pujari and Suyog Deshpande (assistant direction), Ganesh Phuke (sound recordist), Nachiket Pendase (camera), and team TCOL.

Over the past 17 years, Aasakta has had around 800 performances of more than 30 different plays in Marathi, Hindi and English. Its plays have been selected and performed at National School of Drama’s Bharat Rang Mahotsav and TIE’s Jashne Bachpan, Cairo International Festival for Experimental Theatre, Satellite Theatre Festivals, Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards, Prithvi Theatre Festival, Ranga Shankara Theatre Festival, International Theatre Festival of Kerala.

Director Mohit was initially reluctant to explore the idea of theatre in digital times. He says, “The urgency to do ‘something’ in the theatre had been building in lockdown. I was reluctant but a month-and-a-half back, I wondered, ‘What’s the harm?’, since theatre for us has always been about exploring possibilities on stage.”

345,2020/10/01,A courtroom drama on Zoom,"A jury drama devised by Chennai-based theatre company Dramact will unfold on a Zoom screen this weekend

The court is in session over the Zoom app. Split screens pop up as the jury assembles to discuss a case.

In an ideal world, the proceedings would have happened on a stage, replete with an elaborate set. But now, Chennai-based Dramact’s Reasonable Doubt will take form on the video conferencing platform, and then be live-streamed on YouTube to reach a wider audience. “It’s a jury drama. We have 12 characters, all perfectly delineated, in a jury room for 90 minutes,” says director Nilakantan N aka Nilu. “The story traces their fights and differences of opinion till they reach a common verdict,” he adds.

Though tweaked for a Zoom performance, the play has its own fair share of physicality to it. Reasonable Doubt is a quick play. Terse dialogues and one-liners are its strength; this also makes it a viable play for this particular medium.

The rehearsals were also managed online. “It is difficult for the actors because they have to find a way to interact with each other without the physical presence,” says Nilu.

The cast of 12 joins from different parts of the world. “Two of the actors are from Bengaluru, one each from Hyderabad and Connoor, and one from Hong Kong,” he notes. They have also had to work around time zones to realise the play, which made it quite the first time experience for Nilu.

However, not being “geographically challenged”, Nilu remarks, helped him reunite with actors he had not worked with for long. The catch here is the blocking. Everything from eyelines to moving positions in alignment to fellow actors matter. “Most of the time, the audience will see one person on the screen, or the character who is speaking,” says Nilu, adding, “But this doesn’t mean that the characters don’t interact with each other. Their positioning has also been choreographed.”

Reasonable Doubt will be performed on October 3, at 7 pm. Find tickets at www.mdnd.in.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/zgoif5/article32741895.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/a-jury-drama-on-zoom-screen/article32741896.ece
346,2020/10/01,Cruise down the Hooghly river offers a peek into Kolkata’s history,"Affordable 90-minute guided experience guide launched by Bengal Transport Department on October 1

It is along the bends of the river Hooghly that the city of Kolkata grew from three villages to a bustling metropolis. Now a cruise on the Hooghly will take people past the different ghats of the river, providing a peek into the history of the metropolis.

From October 1, the West Bengal Transport Department (WBTD) commences a 90-minute Heritage River Cruise that starts from the Millennium Park Jetty.

Sailing upstream and downstream, the vessel will pass beneath the majestic Howrah Bridge, and go past ghats such as the Armenian ghat, Nimtala ghat and Mayer ghat. Each ghat on the bank of the river has a bit of history attached to it.

For instance, the Armenian ghat was built back in 1734 by Manvel Hazaar Maliyan, a trader of Armenian origin. The ferry ghat stands testimony to Kolkata’s cosmopolitan culture in the colonial times, and the Armenian community’s contribution to the city.

There is also the Mayer ghat (the mother’s ghat), which draws its name from Maa Sarada Devi, wife of Ramakrishna Paramhamsa. She would visit the ghat daily, and stayed near it from May 1909 to July 1920.

Similarly, the Nimtala ghat is a historical landmark where the cremation of Rabindranath Tagore and other important cultural icons was performed. The famous Bhootnath temple is located here.

The cruise’s itinerary also includes Chandpal ghat, located just on the northern side of Babughat, the very place where Lord Cornwallis, the first Governor General of India, landed on September 12, 1786. Guides on board the cruise will tell people about the ghats, and visitors will also be provided with complimentary cruise heritage navigation brochures.

Officials of the Transport Department said that tickets have been kept affordable at ₹39 for the entire cruise to attract more people. “The idea is to make the heritage river cruise experience affordable, and popular among the youth,” said the Managing Director of WBTD Rajanvir Singh Kapur.

Following physical distancing norms, as of now, not more than 150 people will be allowed on each trip.

Attempts have been made in the past to boost waterfront tourism in the city by State governments and different agencies. About 17 km of the Hooghly river’s waterfront lies within the metropolitan corporation’s boundaries, of which about a 10 km length of riverfront, from Taktaghat in south Kashipur and Pramanik ghat in the north, represent the most active and vibrant portion of Kolkata’s diverse engagements with the river. There are dozens of ghats on both banks of the river that not only provide a rich slice of history but are associated with the way of life of the city’s people.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/k522bm/article32744413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200929-WA0009jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/cruise-down-the-hooghly-river-offers-a-peek-into-kolkatas-history/article32744253.ece

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday asked officials not to lower guard despite decline in COVID-19 cases in Darjeeling hills and continue testing and tracing protocols in the region.

“The situation has improved in Darjeeling and Mirik. But we need to keep a watch on the situation. We cannot lower guards, more because the festive season is coming,” she said at an administrative review meeting here in Darjeeling district.

Durga Puja committees should set up pandals with open spaces to prevent the spread of the virus, Ms. Banerjee said.

“I again urge Puja committees and the public to cooperate with the police and the administration in following all COVID-19 safety protocols. Everyone should wear a mask and use sanitiser before entering a pandal,” she said.

About regularisation of 4,397 Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) employees, Ms. Banerjee said that such requests should be made after the Covid battle is over.

The CM said while 70 lakh Kisan Credit Cards have already been distributed in the state to help small and marginal farmers, 8 lakh such cards were still left to be given to them.

Banerjee said that 2,800 Sahayata Kendra will be set up across the state to help people get information about ration card, old age pension etc.

Kozhikode registered the highest number of fresh COVID-19 cases in the State on Thursday when 1,072 people were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the district.

As many as 1,005 of them were infected through local transmission, including 388 from within the Kozhikode corporation alone, said a release from the District Medical Officer. There were 16 cases from Beypore within the city limits. The other areas in the district with a high incidence of infection are Thiruvalloor (48), Villiappally (46), Koduvally (39), Olavanna (36), Kottur (33), Koyilandy (31), and Feroke (30).

The source of infection in 45 persons is not known. The number of active cases in the district is now 7,485. There are 16 health workers among the newly infected. As many as 3,457 people are undergoing treatment at home.

Four deaths were reported at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, on Wednesday and Thursday.

Meanwhile, the district administration has made COVID Jagrata ID mandatory for those testing positive for the virus. According to sources, this is part of efforts to coordinate COVID-19 treatment procedures and route them through the portal. As soon as anyone is reported infected, details will be uploaded on to the portal, and an SMS with the ID number will be sent to the person’s registered mobile number. This number can be used for further treatment.

The respective local bodies will get details about the surveillance steps. Health workers will contact the infected person to figure out the admission process. The portal has facilities for daily monitoring and tele-consultation as well. If there are symptoms, a reference letter will be automatically sent from the portal to the hospital. The ID will be mandatory for insurance claims too, the sources said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kozhikode-records-highest-number-of-cases-in-state/article32745750.ece
349,2020/10/01,Gold smuggling case: LDF councillor Karat Faisal taken into customs custody,"The councillor had previously been booked for smuggling gold through Calicut International Airport.

In a pre-dawn raid on Thursday, a team from the Customs Commissionerate (Preventive) in Kochi took into custody Karat Faisal, an LDF councillor of Koduvally municipality in Kozhikode district, in connection with the Thiruvananthapuram airport gold smuggling case.

Sources said that Mr. Faisal was taken to Kochi for further questioning on the basis of the ongoing probe. He was allegedly involved in investing and selling gold smuggled through international airports in the State, according to the probe.

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence had made Mr. Faisal an accused in a case of smuggling six kgs of gold through the Calicut International Airport in 2013. A case was slapped on him in connection with gold smuggling in Thiruvananthapuram as well, an official said.

Mr. Faisal won the election from the Parambathu ward of Koduvally municipality as an Independent candidate with the backing of the CPI (M)-led Left Democratic Front, in 2015.

Earlier, CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had sparked a controversy when he used a luxury car owned by Mr. Faisal during the Jana Jagratha Yatra at Koduvally in 2017.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/ify1v4/article32740431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/karat,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/gold-smuggling-case-ldf-councillor-karat-faisal-taken-into-customs-custody/article32740434.ece
350,2020/10/01,Karnataka cold-shoulders Thalassery-Mysuru rail project,"Plan includes lengthy tunnel under the Kabani river to bypass three wildlife sanctuaries

The Karnataka government has not yet responded to a proposal by the Kerala government to establish a railway line from Thalassery to Mysuru.

Sources said that the Karnataka government had not replied even to a suggestion of the Kerala government to entrust the Konkan Railway Corporation Limited (KRCL) with the task of carrying out a survey for the project which is under the consideration of the Kerala Rail Development Corporation Limited (K-Rail). Incidentally, the Thalassery-Mysuru broad gauge line and the Nanjangud-Nilambur railway line are still under the consideration of K-Rail, a joint venture company under the State government and the Ministry of Railways.

K-Rail took up the four-year-old rail line project connecting Thalassery to Mysuru via Mananthavady in Wayanad district. The proposed rail line connects Thalassery, Panoor, Vilangad, Niravilpuzha, Tharuvana, Kalpetta, Meenangady, and Pulpaly in Kerala and H.D. Kotte, Kadakole, and Mysoru in Karnataka. “Now, the project has gone into cold storage with even the Chief Secretary unable to communicate with his counterpart in Karnataka for the past six months. The COVID-19 lockdown also added to the woes of the project getting a formal approval,” an official said.

Last year, the Ministry of Railways had asked the Kerala government not to go ahead with the survey for the project until it received the approval from the Karnataka government. The present proposal also included a lengthy tunnel under the Kabani river so as to save the wildlife tracts of Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, and the Nagerhole National Park.

Rail line to Wayanad

Meanwhile, the State government has plans to undertake a new rail line project within Kerala linking Kannur to Wayanad. The modalities are being worked out to prepare a detailed project report and then task the KRCL with the survey. However, carving out a new proposal from an existing project has to get the concurrence of the Ministry of Railways. This may also face ecological issues in the State, the sources said.

The lack of train services has forced people from the State, especially from north Kerala, to rely on buses to reach Karnataka. The only rail connectivity to Bengaluru is through the Palakkad-Salem route. But this is not only time-consuming but also a saturated traffic corridor.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/karnataka-cold-shoulders-thalassery-mysuru-rail-project/article32736979.ece

352,2020/10/01,MVD to take legal action against online campaign,"Alleged circulation of fabricated information on drive against altered vehicles

The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) will resort to legal action against those who have allegedly unleashed an online campaign to tarnish its image by circulating wrong information on the ongoing enforcement drive against altered vehicles. Criminal cases are likely to be registered against those behind the circulation of fabricated information.

Joint Transport Commissioner (Enforcement) Rajiv Puthalath told The Hindu on Wednesday that the MVD squads had not fined vehicle owners for minor sticker work or decorations on their vehicles. “We focused only on vehicles which were dangerously altered challenging public safety. And, the drive will continue,” he affirmed.

Mr. Puthalath claimed that the anti-MVD campaign was spearheaded by some vehicle-modification companies after a modified vehicle was impounded for serious safety rule violation. “After this incident, there was a lot of defaming propaganda that the enforcement squads were sharing a percentage of the fine charged. We will challenge this by filing a criminal case,” he said.

According to MVD officials, those behind the suspicious campaign against the department were mostly from social media groups on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. A few group members were also found sharing the “fake challan” documents created using fake social media IDs.

Ahead of the northeast monsoon, the district administration held a meeting here on Wednesday and directed all department heads to be on the alert and stressed the need to work swiftly and with coordination so that there was no loss of lives.

Presiding over the meeting, Collector J. Jayakanthan said officials of Revenue, PWD and Rural Development departments had been told to monitor rainfall on a daily basis. From past experience, the departments had identified 84 locations as “low-lying"" or “critical” areas.

Similarly, TANGEDCO and Fire and Rescue Services departments were also told to conduct campaigns in urban and rural pockets about the need to stay safe during rain and not to venture out. In case of emergency, the officials suggested snapping of power supply until rescue operations were over. For instance, in the event of a tree fall leading to collapse of electric poles, it would be ideal to suspend power supply until restoration work was completed.

Officials of Disaster Management Cell said public could contact 1077 and, on receipt of the call, it would be shared with the officers concerned. The emergency ambulance service in the district was also told to be on alert.

The district, which received 904 mm as annual average rainfall, had so far recorded about 400 mm rainfall. In the next 100 days, it would get the balance during the northeast monsoon.

The mobile numbers of the volunteers would be shared with the officers concerned at block levels.

Highways department officials were told to be prepared to face road damage and breaches from tank and carry out their operations in a smooth manner. They responded that sand bags were kept as a standby at vantage locations.

An official said that after 2005, there had been no major issues in the district during the NE monsoon as problems such as inundation were addressed over the years. The Vaigai stretch up to Tirupuvanam side would be closely monitored as any heavy discharge into the river could lead to panic among residents.

Justice D. Krishnakumar observed that the failure on the part of the officials concerned without considering the applications for transfer of pattas made innocent people to run from pillar to post and seek justice before the court.

Patta is a crucial documentary evidence for claiming ownership of the property. It can be used to establish the right of ownership in the court of law. In cases where lands were acquired by the government, compensation has been awarded based on pattas, the judge said.

Further, the judge said that farmers who hold pattas could avail several subsidy schemes announced by the government. But, to obtain these pattas, lakhs of applications were pending before the authorities for months and sometimes years together.

Issuing a series of directions, the court directed the pendency of applications - both involving sub-division and those not involving sub-division - shall be disposed of by the authorities within a period of six months on or before March 2021.

The Commissioner of Land Administration shall strictly instruct all Collectors to conduct review meetings periodically on guidelines issued by the government. The Director of Survey and Settlement shall also conduct a review meeting.

The Commissioner of Land Administration or the Collector shall assign Zonal Deputy Tahsildars exclusively for dealing with disposal of applications for granting online pattas. Any delay in disposal shall be communicated to the Collector.

Based on the report submitted, the Collector shall call for an explanation for the delay from the official concerned and if the explanation is not found to be satisfactory, disciplinary action can be initiated for the delay.

The Commissioner of Land Administration is directed to issue the instructions to all Collectors and revenue officials concerned to strictly comply with the order of the court and dispose of the applications within the specified time limit, the judge said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-issues-directions-for-swift-disposal-of-patta-applications/article32746562.ece

Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks leading to their deaths, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday dismissed their bail petitions.

Justice V. Bharathidasan observed that the statements of the witnesses reveal that the father-son duo were asked to clean the blood that had oozed from their wounds and scattered on the floor of the police station, with their own vests. The torture continued throughout the night, the court said.

The policemen also managed to obtain a certificate from the doctor as ‘both of them were fit for remand.’ Thereafter, they were produced before the Judicial Magistrate, Sattankulam, who remanded them in judicial custody.

The postmortem reports also clearly reveal that both of them died due to complications of blunt injuries sustained by them. Two women Head Constables working in the same police station were eyewitnesses to the occurrence and one of them has given a statement before the Judicial Magistrate concerned, the judge said.

Further, the court observed that the CBI investigation had revealed that the accused were involved in registering a false complaint against the traders and the suspended Inspector of Police Sridhar had instigated the accused policemen to teach them a lesson on ‘how to behave with police.’

The judge said that the materials available on record prima facie disclose that the petitioners have committed the offence. That apart, it is a case of custodial death, in which two innocent persons have lost their precious lives. Furthermore, the petitioners are police personnel and there is reasonable apprehension that witnesses can be influenced.

The picking of lots for admission of students under Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, was held in 368 private matriculation and elementary schools in the district on Thursday where the number of applicants received was more than the quota allowed for each school.

The RTE Act mandates private schools to set aside 25% of their entry-level seats for students from economically weaker sections of the society.

According to officials from the School Education department, the district has 5,752 seats reserved under RTE Act in 159 matriculation and 284 nursery and primary schools. Through the online system of application that was held from August 27 to September 25, 5,953 applications were received for these seats. Out of them, 4,984 applications were deemed eligible.

Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan said separate monitoring teams were formed to ensure that admissions were done as per stipulated procedures. A separate list of candidates for the waiting list were also selected.

Though the process was largely complaint-free, a section of parents and activists raised their grievance of schools rejecting applications of candidates whose residences were outside one-km radius from the school.

P. Muthulakshmi, a resident of Bharathiyar Nagar near Pillar Salai, said a private school in Nagamalai Pudukottai had rejected her application as her residence was located around 1.5 km away from the school.

R. Charles, a volunteer who assisted parents in the online application for RTE Act seats, said there were several complaints across the district of schools rejecting applications due to the violation of the one-km norm. “But all these parents faced no issues when they filed the online applications they entered their address on Google Maps and chose schools that were near home.

The meeting, chaired recently by its Chairman and Commissioner for Municipal Administration K. Bhaskaran, cleared the proposals including installation of two solar power plants with the cumulative capacity of 5 MW.

One of the major proposals cleared was deepening and beautification of NGO Colony Periyakulam, which was desilted by locals with a contribution of ₹ 12 lakh a year ago on an outlay of ₹ 6.70 crore, and construction of washermen ghat at Vannarpet and Karuppanthurai at a cost of ₹ 4.20 crore.

“We have identified 31 spots in the Palayamkottai and Melapalayam zones for erecting modern bus shelters, where digital boards providing information to commuters about buses passing through these points, destinations, timing, distance, duration of travel would be fitted. So it will be of great help for newcomers to the city. We’ve earmarked ₹ 4.98 crore for the work,” said V. Narayanan Nair, Chief Executive Officer, Tirunelveli Smart City Limited.

Besides, these two zones will get glowing traffic signals on an outlay of ₹ 4.35 crore.

As there is a plan to create a techno-park, similar to a mini science centre, at the entrance of Vaeinthaankulam new bus stand to teach scientific principles to children, the latest meeting has allotted ₹ 5.60 crore more to add interesting scientific working models in it. Moreover, ₹ 11.50 crore would be spent for creating passenger-friendly amenities at the entrance of the bus terminus.

There is also a plan to install 2 solar power plants with a capacity of 3 MW and 2 MW at Ramaiyanpatti garbage dump yard at a cost of ₹ 25 crore as the civic body has got unused land in adequate extent in the area. As the power to be generated by these solar power plants would meet requirements of the civic body, these plants will ensure huge savings for the corporation.

Another ₹ 5.20 crore would be spent to buy specialized vehicles and machineries for the corporation’s solid waste management programme. Wards 18, 19 and 20 would get 7 parks at a cost of ₹ 9.76 crore as per the clearance accorded by the board.

While admitting that the lockdown did have adverse impact on projects being implemented, Dr. Bhaskaran said officials concerned, led by Dr. Narayanan Nair and Corporation Commissioner G. Kannan, should expedite the ongoing works in the wake of the lockdown relaxation.

Though Tirunelveli Smart City Limited had been ranked second in Tamil Nadu, the early completion of works and its quality would elevate it to enviable ranking in the all-India-level ranking from its present 56th position, Dr. Bhaskaran said.

373,2020/10/01,Bio-mining proposal awaits govt. nod,"It involves digging out waste from landfill sites

A Mangaluru City Corporation proposal for bio-mining of solid waste at its landfill site at Pachchanady to reclaim land for further use is awaiting the approval of the State government, according to Commissioner of the corporation Akshy Sridhar.

Bio-mining is a process involving digging out previously dumped or disposed of material from landfill sites to recover plastic, metal, glass, combustibles, other fine material and soil. Plastic, metals and other material thus recovered can be sent for re-cycling. The bio-degradable waste in a landfill site gets decomposed. When non-biodegradable material in the same site are recovered and sent for re-cycling, the land under them can be reclaimed for further use. With this, there is no need to scout for more land for dumping municipal solid waste.

Municipal solid waste is being dumped at Pachchanady for decades without segregation of waste at source. The need for bio-mining rose after solid waste at the landfill site slipped covering 13.5 acres of private land, including farm land, in the 2019 rainy season. In addition, the civic body is facing the dearth of land for expanding the site.

Bio-mining is estimated to cost about ₹ 17 crore, the Commissioner said.

The dumped solid waste spread over 25 acres, including the 13.5 acres of private land, in Pachchanady is estimated to be six lakh tonnes. Once bio-mining is taken up, it is expected to come down to 2.4 lakh tonnes as the refuse derived fuel (RDF) material (such as plastic recovered) in the site are estimated at 40 %, he said.

An environment engineer in the corporation said that the proposal, revised and sent last month, is now before the Directorate of Municipal Administration. It will have to pass the scrutiny of a State Level Technical Committee.

The ₹ 17 crore cost estimated excludes the transportation of the recovered material in bales. Bales of plastic recovered will have to be transported to cement industries which are at least 700 km away from Mangaluru. It required an additional fund, he said.

Compensation

The Commissioner said that of the 35 families affected due to garbage slipping and that have “pahani”, 19 families have been paid a compensation of nearly ₹ 2 crore for damage to their farm land. Of the remaining 16 families, 13 that have submitted their documents will get ₹ 52 lakh compensation shortly.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bio-mining-proposal-awaits-govt-nod/article32746440.ece

Property tax payers in the city will be able to pay their taxes on-line from this December. People can also pay their water bills on-line after two months from now, according to Commissioner of Mangaluru City Corporation Akshy Sridhar.

Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, he said that the civic body will issue trade licences on-line on a trial basis from October 2. The trail will go on for two weeks.

Once the system is through, it will stop issuing manual licence. The process of issuing a trade licence starting from applying for licence, paying prescribed fees, uploading relevant documents and photos, approving licence, the identification of the trade through geo tagging, renewal of licence, issuing and cancelling licence will be done on-line. KEONICS has developed software for the purpose.

Property tax fine

The Commissioner said that the corporation has extended the last date for paying property tax without fine for 2020-21 till October 31. Fine will be imposed from November 1.

Central Market

Mr. Sridhar said that the civic body allowed about 30 retail traders who have valid trade licence to do business at the Central Market on Tuesday. Those traders have obtained licence in their names and are doing business themselves without outsourcing it to another trader. The corporation will not allow such traders in the market who do business by obtaining licence in the name of others.

It also posted this video on the You Tube.

The Beary, which is spoken by over 20 lakh people all over the world, was dependent on Kannada script and Arabic numerals. Following six months of work by an expert committee, the Academy released the Beary script and numerals reccently.

Apart from Beary script and numerals, the Academy has named 12 months in Beary namely Surumada (January) and Cheremada (February), while days have names for example ‘Nyarase’ (Sunday) and ‘Tingalase’ (Monday).

Speaking at the function organised to release the DVD on Wednesday, Basheer Baikampady, the President of the Beary Sahitya Pinna Samskrutika Sangha, said it was proud moment for a language to have its own script. ""It does not mean, people will start using it from today.

Differing with Mr. Baikampady, president of Dakshina Kannada Sahitya Parishat S. Pradeep Kumar Kalkura said more than the script the Academy should work to reach out Beary literature, lifestyle and customs among wider audience.

382,2020/10/01,Negative ratings surged on COVID-19 curbs: ICRA,"‘Credit profile of many units weakened’

Business disruption caused by COVID-19 has led to a weakening in the credit profile of a large number of entities resulting in a sharp increase in negative rating actions taken by ICRA.

In the first half of this fiscal (H1), ICRA took 582 negative rating actions which, on an annualised basis, accounted for 32% of its rated portfolio, compared with 23% in FY20. About half of the negative rating actions were downgrades. As downgrades rose, the annualised downgrade rate touched a high of 17% in H1 FY2021 compared with the past five-year average of 10%, it said.

Instances of upgrades were unsurprisingly sparse. ICRA upgraded the ratings of just 94 entities in H1 FY21, reflecting an annualised upgrade rate of 5%, compared with the past five-year average of 9%. In H1 FY21, the top five sectors (in terms of the count and the proportion of entities in the sector) that faced a negative rating action included textiles, real estate, hospitality, auto ancillaries and construction.

“All these sectors (barring hospitality) were already facing a demand slowdown prior to the onset of COVID-19 and the pandemic-induced disruption further amplified the adverse effects,” ICRA said.

“While negative rating actions in these sectors and the overall portfolio in general were high, there were lesser instances of defaults. Only 11 defaults were observed in ICRA’s rated universe in H1 FY2021 compared with 83 defaults seen in FY2020,” it added.

To a large extent, this is because many entities in ICRA’s rated portfolio (27%) availed a moratorium on payments on their bank loan facilities as permitted by the RBI alleviating default risk during the period of moratorium.

“While credit quality pressures have remained elevated, the situation could have been worse without the interventions seen on the fiscal, monetary and regulatory fronts,” said Jitin Makkar, head, credit policy, ICRA. “The mitigating effects of the measures manifested favourably in the broader financial markets as well as some specific sectors,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/negative-ratings-surged-on-covid-19-curbs-icra/article32747481.ece
383,2020/10/01,‘Credit ratio plunges to a decade low’,"Coinciding with India’s sharpest gross domestic product contraction, the credit ratio (upgrades to downgrades) of Crisil-rated firms for the first half plunged to 0.54, the lowest in more than a decade, with 296 downgrades and 161 upgrades.

Stating that the credit ratio was cushioned by regulatory support to some extent, Crisil said the corporate credit profiles remain vulnerable even as demand claws back amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

“While the rate of upgrades plunged as expected with the pandemic crushing demand, the rate of downgrades did not surge as feared,” said Crisil.

“That’s because credit profiles were cushioned by proactive regulatory measures by RBI and SEBI,” the ratings agency added.

Over the past six months, credit quality trends have clearly brought to the fore sectoral resilience in terms of demand, balance sheet strength and liquidity. High-resilience sectors such as pharmaceuticals actually had a credit ratio of more than one in the first half of this fiscal, led by steady demand and robust balance sheets, Crisil analysts said.

On the other hand, moderate- and least-resilient sectors saw downgrades far outnumbering upgrades, because of the discretionary nature of goods and services, and leveraged balance sheets for several of them, they added.

“We expect credit quality pressure on India Inc. to persist in the second half of this fiscal,” said Gurpreet Chhatwal, president, Crisil Ratings.

“There has been a near-doubling of ratings with a ‘negative’ outlook, and ‘on watch’ in the past 12 months.”

“While the moratorium has provided near-term relief, demand recovery for moderate and least-resilient sectors will be protracted. Timely restructuring support from lenders will be crucial to credit quality,” he added.

According to Crisil, sectors that will be under close watch include airlines, gems and jewellery, auto dealers, hotels and real estate. Sectors exhibiting moderate resilience include thermal power generators, textiles, retail, and roads and construction.

The financial sector, too, will bear the brunt with growth in bank credit seen nosediving to multi-decade lows of 0-1% and assets under management of non-banks contracting 1-3% this fiscal, it said.

The one-time restructuring permitted by the RBI could help the asset quality of banks without which, non-performing assets would have touched a two-decade high of 11.5% by the end of this fiscal, it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/credit-ratio-plunges-to-a-decade-low/article32747263.ece
384,2020/10/01,"GST revenues cross ₹95,000 crore in September","Indicates economic activity picking up.

Revenue collections from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in September hit ₹95,480 crore, the highest in this financial year so far, indicating that economic activity is picking up steam in tandem with the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

September’s indirect tax collections were over 10% higher than August, 4% higher than the GST kitty in the same month a year ago and marked only the second time that the ₹90,000 crore mark was crossed this financial year.

The Hindu Explains | What is the GST compensation due to States?

GST collections had been sliding after January 2020 when nearly ₹1.11 lakh crore came in. March 2020, by the end of which the national lockdown was imposed, recorded GST inflows of ₹97,597 crore. April and May saw the worst hit, bringing in little over ₹32,000 crore and ₹62,000 crore, respectively.

“The gross GST revenue collected in the month of September, 2020 is ₹95,480 crore, of which Central GST is ₹17,741 crore, State GST is ₹23,131 crore, Integrated GST is ₹47,484 crore [including ₹22,442 crore collected on import of goods] and cess is ₹7,124 crore [including ₹788 crore collected on import of goods],” the Finance Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

Economists were cautious about reading the healthier numbers as a sign of a sustainable rebound from the sharp 23.9% contraction in the country’s gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2020-21.

Principal economist at rating agency ICRA Aditi Nayar said the uptick in GST collections had come as a relief, although it had likely been driven by ‘a combination of pent up demand and inventory restocking, and thus its sustainability remains unclear.’

“Overall, the high frequency data available for the month of September 2020 confirms that a fragmented recovery is under way. We continue to expect the GDP contraction to narrow appreciably to 12.4% in the second quarter,” Ms. Nayar said.

Comment | GST reform needs a new grand bargain

“With a significant part of the economy resuming operations and international trade as well resuming pace, the collections have shown decent growth,” said Abhishek Jain, EY tax partner. Revenues from import of goods were at 102% and revenues from domestic transactions which include import of services were at 105% of the revenues from these sources during September 2019.

Among the larger States, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu saw the highest growth in GST inflows at 17% and 15%, respectively, compared to September 2019. Andhra Pradesh saw a 8% growth, Gujarat 6%, while Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh saw a flat trend and collections in Karnataka dropped 5%, from a year ago.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/73jw3u/article32747398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GST-1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/gst-collections-at-95480-crore-in-september/article32741936.ece
385,2020/10/01,"Petrol demand returns to pre-COVID-19 levels, diesel sales inching up","The September rise in petrol is a turnaround from the sharp drop witnessed in August.

India’s petrol sales rose 2% in September - the first increase since the country’s lockdown in late March - signalling demand returning to pre-COVID-19 levels.

Diesel sales continue to be below normal but have shown a month-on-month increase, according to provisional data from state-owned fuel retailers who control 90% of the market.

Petrol sales in September rose 2% year-on-year and were up 10.5% over the previous month.

Diesel sales continue to be in the negative territory, with demand falling 7% year-on-year. But the demand was 22% higher over August 2020.

This is the first time that petrol sales in the world’s third-largest oil importer have risen since the March 25 nationwide lockdown crippled economic activity and sent demand plummeting.

Petrol sales rose to 2.2 million tonne in September as compared to 2.16 million tonne in the same month last year and 1.9 million tonne during August 2020.

Demand for diesel, the most consumed fuel in the country, fell to 4.84 million tonne from 5.2 million tonne in September 2019. Sales were 3.97 million tonne during August this year.

Earlier this week, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) Director (Marketing) Arun Kumar Singh had stated that petrol sales were almost at pre-COVID-19 levels but diesel is lagging.

This was because personal mobility was being preferred leading to more private cars on the road. But in case of diesel, consumption sectors like school buses and public transport were at a very subdued level, he had said.

“As we move along, petrol will come into growth zone in October/November while diesel will be in the rate of (minus) -0-3% range,” he had said.

Industry sources said while the Indian economy has started to pick up with lockdown restrictions being lifted since June, local lockdowns by states have hampered the demand quickly picking up.

The September rise in petrol is a turnaround from the sharp drop witnessed in August. Diesel and petrol sales have fallen by 21% and 7.4%, respectively in August from a year earlier.

Jet fuel sales at 6,18,000 tonne was down 54% in September but was 22.5% higher than 2,35,000 tonne sales in August.

Cooking gas LPG sales were up 5% at 2.28 million tonne year-on-year and 3.5% month-on-month.

Car sales rose 14% in August from a year earlier, while two-wheeler sales increased by 3%.

Shrikant Madhav Vaidya, Chairman of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) - the country’s largest fuel retailer, had last month stated that there were signs of demand recovery, but the pandemic’s impact could linger and monthly consumption may edge back to pre-virus levels by the end of the year.

The finance ministry, through a notification on Wednesday, prescribed 5% customs duty on open cells for LED/LCD TV panels.

EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said this levy seems to aim at fostering domestic manufacturing of open cells for televisions in India.

“While this could entail increased costs for some TV manufacturers, a duty leverage could incline TV manufactures for procuring / manufacturing domestically produced open cells and thus, advance the Make in India initiative of the Government,” Jain added.

Till last year, televisions worth ₹7,000 crore were being imported. Television import has also been put on the restricted category with effect from July-end this year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/d9vxd8/article29446948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18TELEVISION-DUTY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/import-duty-of-5-imposed-on-key-component-used-in-tv-manufacturing-from-october-1/article32739237.ece

The cotton season (October 2019-September 2020) has ended with a closing stock of more than 100 lakh bales of cotton, according to the Committee on Cotton Production and Consumption.

Textiles Commissioner Roop Rashi held a virtual meeting of the committee recently to discuss the balance sheet for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons.

It had been estimated that the closing stock for the 2019-2020 season would be 105 lakh bales.

The total production in 2019-20 was expected to be 357 lakh bales and imports, 16 lakh bales. Cotton consumption by textile mills was 228 lakh bales as against 274 lakh bales the previous season (2018-2019). Exports were close to 50 lakh bales.

“With larger production this season and high carry-over stock, prices will fall and the Cotton Corporation of India will be buying huge quantities,” J. Thulasidharan, president of Indian Cotton Federation, said.

It is learnt that the CCI officials were present at the markets in some northern States on Thursday, the first day of the 2020-21 season, to purchase cotton in case the prices had gone below the MSP.

Internationally, cotton stocks are high with drop in consumption because of the COVID-19 impact. Further, prices of man-made fibres have also fallen steeply and many textile units have switched over to these fibres.

393,2020/10/01,‘Most gig workers lost income during pandemic’,"‘Earning slid to ₹15,000 from ₹25,000’

Almost 90% of gig workers in India have lost income during the pandemic, according to a survey by Flourish Ventures, a global fintech venture capital fund.

The survey, conducted among 770 ride-sharing drivers, delivery workers and house cleaners in August, found incomes had collapsed since the lockdown with almost nine out of ten gig workers earning less than ₹15,000 a month in August compared with more than ₹25,000 a month before the pandemic.

Government aid

The firm said government aid had alleviated some hardship as of those surveyed, 42% received food or financial aid from the government as part of COVID-19 relief measures.

“Despite real fears about the health risk, 61% of respondents were more concerned about their ability to work,” as per Flourish Ventures.

“Concern for their livelihoods outweighed gig workers’ worries about even their access to basic needs (17%) or their family’s health (12%),” it added.

To deal with the reduction in incomes, the survey added that 44% of the respondents had resorted to borrowing, 45% have cut consumption, 83% have used their savings, and 57% have acted on the loan moratorium to reduce or halt payments on their debts.

“Most gig workers worry about their future. While immediate cash flow was a moderate concern, at least 61% of respondents’ top concern was saving for old age or paying off debt,” it added.

“This research reveals most are concerned for their financial future,” said Tilman Ehrbeck, managing partner, Flourish.

“At Flourish, our hope is that the same digital platforms which enabled the gig economy can connect workers to new sources of income and better financial tools for security in this crisis and beyond.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ma2lyv/article32747280.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THBUGIG,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/most-gig-workers-lost-income-during-pandemic/article32747281.ece

398,2020/10/01,Outage freezes Tokyo Stock Exchange,"Tokyo Stock Exchange plans to resume normal operations Friday after it halted trading for the day due to what they said was a malfunction in its computer systems - the worst such outage ever.

There was no indication that the outage at the world’s third-largest exchange resulted from hacking or other cybersecurity breaches.

“We are extremely sorry for the troubles we have caused,” exchange President and Chief Executive Koichiro Miyahara told reporters late Thursday.

Some time later, the exchange issued a statement saying it would open as usual on Friday. It said it foresaw no problems with resuming trading.

Mr. Miyahara and other exchange officials said a computer hardware device they called “machine one” failed and the backup “machine two” didn’t kick in, so stock price information was not being relayed properly.

The officials characterized the problem as a memory malfunction.

They said that rebooting the system during a trading session would have caused confusion for investors and other market participants.

Perplexed passers-by studied quote-less electronic screens in Tokyo’s financial district and newspapers’ evening editions carried listed company’s names, but blank prices.

Brokerages were fielding a flood of calls from frustrated investors.

“There should be a plan ‘B,’” Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., told broadcaster NHK.

The Japan Exchange Group is the world’s third largest bourse after the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, with market capitalization of nearly $6 trillion.

The outage Thursday also affected other, smaller stock exchanges in Japan.

Foreigners account for about 70% of all brokerage trading in the Tokyo exchange, both in terms of value and volume, so news of the outage left investors both in Japan and overseas wondering what happened.

The malfunction of basic hardware drew attention to vulnerabilities in the country’s digital systems. Newly appointed Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has made upgrading such infrastructure a priority, viewing it as critical to Japan’s competitiveness.

Previous outages occurred when the huge “Arrowhead” system created by Fujitsu to handle its electronic trading, which officials said involves some 350 servers, became overwhelmed with too many orders at one time.

That’s what happened on Oct. 9, 2018, according to a release on the TSE’s website. But during that disruption, some backup systems for trading continued to function as was the case in earlier outages.

The exchange promised to investigate, conduct malfunction tests and change the system to ensure that a flood of orders would not cause the entire system to stop working. Several top executives of the exchange were penalized.

Despite such occasional disruptions, Miyahara said the motto of the exchange was “never stop.”

Asked about possible losses caused by the outage, he said the exchange was focusing for the time being on fixing the problem.

“I think it is very regrettable that investors are limited in their trading opportunities because they cannot trade on the exchanges,” said Katsunobu Kato, the chief cabinet secretary.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/article21339949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THBUJAPAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/outage-freezes-tokyo-stock-exchange/article32742213.ece

During the session, the domestic unit witnessed an intra-day high of 73.07 and a low of 73.60 against the greenback.

“We are expecting the rupee to trade with a slight appreciation bias in the near-term, given the persistent dollar inflows in the domestic market and a healthy current account surplus,” said Sugandha Sachdeva VP-Metals, Energy and Currency Research, Religare Broking.

Mr. Sachdeva further noted that “72.80 remains a strong hurdle for the rupee, and the Reserve Bank of India may not be very comfortable allowing it to appreciate above those levels.”

Going ahead, the market will be watching developments around the next round of US fiscal stimulus package, without which the upbeat risk appetite may not be able to sustain for very long, Mr. Sachdeva said.

Definition : a primate; perhaps, what Dubya once was

Answer : BUSHBABY

Clue explained:

We need an 8-letter word here. Not sure yet which is the definition? Well, try out options for which part of the clue may possibly define the answer.

A ‘primate’ is a creature that usually lives around trees and has mammalian traits, right? Well, a bushbaby sort of fits that description.

Now, let’s see whether the rest of the clue’s wordplay might possibly construct the word BUSHBABY.

In case you were wondering, ‘Dubya’ is a nickname for former American President George W. Bush. Why? Well, the initial for his middle name — W — is pronounced as ‘dubya’. Get it?

And so, if former U.S. Prez Bush, a.k.a. ‘Dubya’, ‘once was’ something, he was probably a baby.

403,2020/10/01,The challenge of changing health behaviour,"Health behaviour is a subset of human behaviour and is linked to a person’s living and working conditions

The role of health behaviour (our diet, physical activity, sleep, smoking, substance use, and so on) in public health practice needs special attention during an epidemic. The challenge is that the onus of altering health behaviour lies with the individuals who often don’t have the option of changing their livelihood. We see this during this pandemic. This demonstrates the failure of public health in internalising the knowledge about the social origins of human behaviour. Let’s examine four aspects of our response to COVID-19.

Identifying ‘at risk’ sections

The real skill of public health professionals during an epidemic is to identify those social groups which can be at greater risk to disease at any given point of time. The screening of those groups becomes efficient when the high-risk groups are identified and targeted for systematic surveillance to prevent potential spread of a disease. In other words, the real skill of public health surveillance is to pick up those who are at risk from a general population, even before they know that they are at risk. To know whether any group is at risk or not is possible only if we have a deep understanding of the society and its people and their livelihood-related behaviour of which health behaviour forms a part.

Comment | The pandemic and the challenge of behaviour change

It is this classic public health act of identifying an ‘at risk’ population that calls for an anthropological understanding of human lives for which understanding risky health behaviour becomes inevitable. Laboratory tests only categorise the population as ‘positive’ and ‘negative’. These can be matched with those with risky health behaviour and non-risky health behaviour. These categories are further linked to their livelihood characteristics and are crucial for effective public health action. Any attempt to over-emphasise laboratory tests during an epidemic without capturing the health behaviour of people is actually putting the cart before the horse. This is what happens when very little is known about people, their occupation and health behaviour.

Another related but crucial aspect of health behaviour is the significant linkage it has with the prevention of an epidemic. The primary purpose of public health action during an epidemic is to prevent the spread of a disease in the community. When laboratory tests that are meant for clinical practice become the starting point, and when guidelines state that only those with symptoms be tested, this does not help prevent the spread of the disease. This is because testing is done among those who already have symptoms and who have the potential to transmit the disease to others by the time test results are available. The overreliance on laboratory tests not only means that we lose the opportunity to detect those who are possibly at high risk of transmission but also the opportunity to look for high risk behaviour among people. In other words, the approach to tackle COVID-19 allows, by design, silent transmission of the disease within populations.

Capacity to modify behaviour

The third important aspect is the the role of health awareness in health behaviour. Many who are at risk find it difficult to modify their health behaviour despite being aware that they are at risk. People are aware that taking precautions like wearing masks, hand washing and maintaining physical distancing can prevent transmission of the disease. Yet we hear of politicians, celebrities, healthcare workers and those travelling in public transport testing positive for COVID-19. This implies that there is a limit to an individual’s capacity to modify his behaviour and sustain that behaviour without altering his living and working condition.

Related to this is the fact that if there is success in controlling an epidemic, the credit goes to science and institutions and the government, whereas if there is a failure to control the epidemic, the blame is placed on the people. There is a failure to understand that health behaviour is only a subset of human behaviour and is closely linked to a person’s living and working conditions. Behavourial change takes place when society is organised in such a way that there is no option to engage in risky/ unhealthy behaviour by virtue of one’s occupation or social position. Right now, those who can afford to modify their life conditions without affecting their livelihood are the ones who are mostly able to keep away from the risk of COVID-19.

Finally, it is important to examine ways by which States/ governments intervene to ensure that people follow a certain health behaviour. Most States invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 and some gave the police the responsibility to ensure that people follow certain health behaviour. What is the expectation of public health professionals about people’s health behaviour during epidemics? Can we expect people to recognise the potential risks on their own and keep away from those risks? Disease control models focus on modifying individual risk factors. The role of public health in this case gets largely confined to ‘preaching’ with very little scope for action. The second approach has been to create fear of punishment as the basis of behavioural change. The police is given the responsibility to fine people when they violate rules. This has serious ethical implications, especially for those who cannot afford certain health behavioural practices. What history teaches us is that those health behavioural practices that are ‘natural’ and linked to living and working conditions are more acceptable and sustainable and are followed by people voluntarily. The task of public health professionals is to understand those health behavioural practices and the relationship of those practices with social structures and institutions. Anything short of this commitment in public health will ultimately result in putting the onus on the people to adopt ‘self-control’ which is the same as ‘preaching’, where there is little scope for action.

For real change

Health behaviour plays a critical role in deciding the success of any public health intervention. The potential of health behaviour to transform the direction of any crisis is immense. The real change in health behaviour is possible only when there is acknowledgement of its societal roots and there are efforts to alter it at multiple levels. Instead, putting the onus of changing or modifying health behaviour onto individuals will only result in ‘victim blaming’ and create distrust between people and those responsible for epidemic control.

404,2020/10/01,Is one language enough?,"A look at how Hindi stands the test among a plethora of languages in India

While negotiating independence from Dutch colonial rule, Indonesian nationalists decided that a reformed version of Malay (renamed Bahasa Indonesia) would become the official language. Malay had evolved due to the need in maritime Southeast Asia for a lingua franca for trade and other exchanges. In this region, hundreds of languages were spoken across thousands of islands that now comprise the modern nations of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. As it was grammatically simple, non-hierarchical, and easier to learn than other regional languages, Malay became an accepted language of communication. Bahasa Indonesia aimed to bring more than 300 ethnic groups together with no one ethnic group, including the Javanese, overshadowing the rest. From the outset of its independence, Indonesia recognised the importance of avoiding the inequality that was likely to occur by imposing the language of one dominant ethnic group over others.

Debates in the Constituent Assembly

In contrast, the issue of adopting a national language could not be resolved when the Constituent Assembly began drafting India’s Constitution. The adoption of a national language, the language in which the Constitution was to be written, and the language in which the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly were to be conducted were the main questions debated. On the one side were members from the Hindi-speaking provinces who moved a number of pro-Hindi amendments and argued for adopting Hindi as the sole national language. One of the drafters declared, “People who do not know Hindustani have no right to stay in India. People who are present in the House to fashion a constitution... and do not know Hindi are not worthy to be members of this Assembly.” A member of the Assembly from the south said, “If we are going to be compelled to learn Hindi... I would perhaps not be able to do it at my age, and perhaps I would not be willing... because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need... will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language of the Centre.”

Editorial | Language of unity: on rejection of the three-language formula

Widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in Tamil Nadu, led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English for all official purposes. Hindi became the sole working language of the Union government by 1965 with the State governments free to function in the language of their choice. Meanwhile, the constitutional directive for the Union government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained within Central government entities in non-Hindi-speaking States.

Later, Hindi speakers from the IT, construction and other sectors began moving for jobs to the south where many languages and dialects are spoken. Despite this migration to States that speak other languages, the Census found that while Hindi is the fastest growing language, the number of speakers of other languages has dropped. In Tamil Nadu, for example, over a 10-year period, the number of Tamil speakers of Hindi doubled largely because Tamilians needed to converse with those who came from the north.

Loss of a language and a way of life

According to the 2001 Census, India has 30 languages that are spoken by more than a million people each. The Constitution lists 22 languages and protects them in the eighth schedule. Many languages are kept out of this schedule even if they deserve to be included. This includes Tulu which is spoken by over 1.8 million people and has inscriptions dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries. When a refined language loses its status in literary and daily interactions, the way of life associated with it also vanishes.

On the other hand, Hindi, a much younger Indo-Aryan language, has been gaining prominence since before independence. Old Hindi assimilated words from Persian. With the arrival of Islamic administrative rule in north India, it became Hindustani. The growing importance of Hindustani in colonial India and the association of Urdu with Muslims prompted Hindus in north India to develop a Sanskritised version, leading to the formation of a modern standard Hindi a century later. It was based on the vernacular of Delhi and the surrounding region and came to replace prestige dialects such as Awadhi, Maithili and Braj. The literary value of these dialects diminished in due course.

Data | What percentage of people prefer to speak Hindi across States?

While discussing Hindi and its use, let us also focus on the merit of other Indian languages. It we don’t protect and promote other well-evolved or endangered and indigenous languages, our future generations may end up never understanding their ‘real’ roots and culture. Instead of focusing on one national language, why not learn a language beyond one’s mother tongue and get to know a different way of life too?

405,2020/10/01,Constraining critique: On Amnesty halting India operations,"Amnesty’s decision to close shop in India is unfortunate

The role played by human rights organisations in documenting and questioning state functioning and excesses is a necessary component of civil society activism, which enhances democracy by securing accountability. The fact that Amnesty International, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, had to halt operations in India because of the freezing of its bank accounts and intrusive scrutiny from state agencies is therefore unfortunate. The government’s response to Amnesty’s decision, that it will not allow “interference in domestic political debates by entities funded by foreign donations”, suggests that this denouement is linked to the group’s critical reporting of decisions such as the abrogation of special status for Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. The group has maintained that it has raised financial resources lawfully. Amnesty has taken up human rights causes such as minority rights, ending torture, abolition of the death penalty and refugee rights, globally. Advocacy of these causes has led to the group being at loggerheads with regimes of various types — from the democratic to the authoritarian — across countries. India now joins the ranks of countries such as Russia where the group has stopped operations. There is no doubt that the pursuit of these objectives, even if it is not uniform across a lopsided world, has only enhanced and furthered the cause of human rights and their awareness for global citizens. Democratic regimes that are bound by constitutionalism should not consider critical activism by groups such as Amnesty as being adversarial, but instead view it as constructive critique of their functioning. If the critique is not reasoned, the state can rebut it through communiqués and responses, but should not restrict freedom of expression through intimidation or restraining actions.

Central governments in India have consistently registered discomfort with critical civil society organisations over the years, but the National Democratic Alliance-led government has taken steps to constrain groups even more, especially those that are trans-national in their functioning. This was exemplified in the monsoon session where amendments to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Act drafted without consulting stakeholders were rushed through Parliament with little discussion. For India to aspire to become a developed and a just nation, it must build on its strengths such as its demographic dividend and the procedural institutions that have been built over decades. For it to reap benefits from these advantages, entrepreneurship, governmental actions and other economic tools would be necessary but not sufficient. The country needs to allow for a vibrant civil society that has spearheaded several reforms related to accountability (the Right to Information Act), welfare (the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), privacy rights, gender equality and rights of sexual minorities, environmental activism among others. Non-governmental organisations will continue to have a role to play in this. It is to be hoped Amnesty’s decision to halt operations is therefore temporary and that it would be able to function within India’s regulatory framework.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/constraining-critique-the-hindu-editorial-on-amnesty-international-halting-india-operations/article32747343.ece
406,2020/10/01,Justice in ruins: On Babri Masjid demolition case verdict,"India cannot afford successive judicial setbacks to secular values and the rule of law

The ruins of the Babri Masjid were cleared in record time by the hordes of vandals mobilised for demolishing it. Some detritus was still left, though: a belief among many that justice would be done and the Constitution and the rule of law would be upheld if the criminal court punishes those who plotted the events of December 6, 1992. Even when the Supreme Court handed over the empty site to those who wanted the mosque brought down to build a Ram temple, its recognition of the demolition as an “egregious violation of the rule of law” gave rise to hope that the ends of justice would be served by the punishment of those who mobilised the vandals. A Special CBI Court in Lucknow has now cleared the remaining debris with an unconscionable judgment. Throwing to the winds the Supreme Court’s observations on the demolition, the trial court has in effect given judicial legitimation to the ‘Ram Janmabhoomi movement’ by acquitting all those indicted for conspiracy to bring down the structure. Its conclusions are drastic and defy logic and fact. The court’s finding that the demolition was not planned in advance flies in the face of the entry of more than a hundred thousand volunteers into Ayodhya that day, armed with crowbars, spades, hoes and ropes and every implement needed to bring down a sturdy structure and clear the site. The proponents of the movement, headed by L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti among others, had positioned themselves in vantage points to witness the occasion and celebrate with pride what ought to have caused shame and disgust.

It is indeed true that it is not easy to prove a conspiracy, as it essentially takes place in secret. This is where courts must draw reasonable inferences from the circumstances. But in a conspiracy of this nature, it is easy to see that those involved were “marching under a banner”, an image the Supreme Court had once referred to while explaining the ingredients of a conspiracy. In this case, apart from the political mobilisation and the purported intent to assemble on a particular day, the court had with it sufficient evidence that there was studied inaction on the part of the State, whose Chief Minister was one of the accused, and the unambiguous and open threats to the structure voiced by many of the movement’s protagonists. The dissembling Kalyan Singh, as Chief Minister then, had given what, in hindsight, was an obviously false assurance to the highest court and the National Integration Council that nothing but a symbolic ‘kar seva’ would take place. Specific instructions appeared to have been given to the security forces not to stop the ‘kar sevaks’ or hinder their plans. How else would one explain the events? When the crowd went into a frenzy, goaded on by provocative speeches by the dignitaries, and vandals went up the dome, the accused would have the court believe that they were actually trying to restrain the mob and prevent the demolition! The possibility of tampered audio and video evidence or even disavowals on record would not undo the cumulative effect of the logistical and financial preparation, besides the communal mobilisation. Mr. Advani, who had then claimed it was the saddest day of his life, now says the en masse acquittal is a vindication of the movement. This indicates that the objective of the mobilisation, exemplified by his rath yatra, was always to alter the status quo with violence.

The Manmohan Singh Liberhan Commission had laid bare the entire conspiracy in its damning report, but unfortunately, a probe under the Commission of Inquiry Act has no binding value, whereas the evidence adduced at the trial alone matters. It is, of course, the responsibility of the CBI to prove the element of conspiracy, the details of the advance mobilisation, the “meeting of minds” that is required to prove a plot and its broad contours. That the agency failed is no surprise. From the beginning, the police investigation has been marked by bungling. When the main events were covered by two FIRs, the U.P. government initially failed to notify both of them while designating courts for trial. The Allahabad High Court quashed the flawed notification, and the State government’s failure to rectify the irregularity resulted in separate proceedings in Lucknow and Rae Bareilly. The CBI, instead of challenging the State’s rejection of its request for curing a technical defect, filed a supplementary charge sheet after omitting the ‘conspiracy’ charge. The Supreme Court later said this derailed the joint trial and resulted in separate proceedings in two places. In 2017, the Supreme Court revived the conspiracy charge, directed the trial court to resume day-to-day trial and sternly reminded the agency that it was because of its failure and that of the State government that a crime that shook the secular fabric of the Constitution had not seen justice for 25 years. Whether a politically hamstrung agency could have successfully prosecuted such a sensitive case is a moot question. But the results are there for all to see.

Even allowing for the possibility that the judiciary is in close alignment with the executive, it is unacceptable to see a court going so far as to parrot the specious theory advanced by the demolition squad from the BJP-VHP-RSS family for years that the destruction was a “spontaneous act”. All those who went through that disgraceful phase in India’s political history know that the demolition was only the culmination of a revanchist movement. The period was marked by communal mobilisation, holding of processions to gather ‘bricks’ meant for constructing a temple, and an attempt to storm the site in 1990, which ended in bloodshed. Given this grisly background, and the grave implications that the exoneration of those who demolished a religious structure would have on public trust in the judicial system, it is imperative that the CBI goes on appeal. The cause of communal amity cannot afford successive judicial setbacks to both secular values and the rule of law.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/justice-in-ruins-the-hindu-editorial-on-babri-masjid-demolition-case-verdict/article32735773.ece
407,2020/10/01,Theatres gearing to open amidst uncertainty,"Owners are not confident about new films being released and whether fans will turn up

After over six months of inactivity, the cinema trade circle – comprising producers, distributors and exhibitors – is abuzz following the Central government’s decision to allow cinema halls to resume operations with 50% seating from October 15.

D.R. Jairaj, chairman, Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce, said that they will be approaching the State government with request that the new guidelines be regularised. The Multiplex Association of India has also urged the State government for “urgent permission to reopen cinemas.”

Managements of single screen theatres and multiplexes, such as INOX and PVR, said they will ensure a “a safe and hygienic cinema experience for movie goers”.

However, many expressed worry over whether citizens will visit theatres given that a majority of people are not patronising restaurants and avoiding public transport as far as possible.

A film distributor said, “On the one hand, there is a cap of 50% on seating. This will impact a producer’s decision to release films that are complete and ready.”

Veteran producer K.C.N. Chandrashekar said that producers, distributors and exhibitors should sit and sort out issues regarding releasing of films and theatre charges. “Producers may not be willing to release films right away, and not all theatre owners might be willing to resume operations. Many such issues need to be sorted out,” he said.

N.S. Srinivasa Murthy, partner of Menaka theatre and former president of FKCCI, said that they are initially planning to run old films or those that were released in February-March. “Based on the response and also the COVID-19 situation, producers will take a decision on releasing new films,” he said.

According to the manager of a theatre in Bengaluru ,instilling confidence in people to visit a theatre will be a challenge. “We will incur more expenditure to put in place anti-COVID-19 safety measures with less revenue,” he said.

A representative of INOX said that most of their screens will resume operations on October 15. Initially, they will screen re-runs and library content. “There are quite a few big movies in various languages getting ready to be released soon,” he said.

Mall owners hope to see more patronage

Mall owners are happy that cinema halls will resume operations in the hope that they will see more customers.

Uday Garudachar, owner of Garuda Mall chain, said that cinema halls are ‘footfall drivers’ in malls. “There are over 15 screens in Garuda Mall chain. I am sure that all of them will resume screening films from October 15 so that business picks up by Dasara and Deepavali,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/em7871/article32746553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGTHEATREP7,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/theatres-gearing-to-open-amidst-uncertainty/article32746554.ece
408,2020/10/01,Seven rowdies booked under Goonda Act,"All of them were booked in September

The city police, which has taken up a special drive against rowdyism, has booked seven rowdies under the Goonda Act in September alone. Those arrested under Goonda Act will have to serve a full year in prison without bail, among other stringent penal clauses.

“Our focus is to curb the rowdy menace in the city, and this drive will continue,” said Police Commissioner Kamal Pant.

Nine rowdies were booked under the Goonda Act in 2019. For the most part of this year, the city police were at the frontline of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, and not a single case had been booked under Goonda Act this year till September.

“Arresting notorious and incorrigible rowdy elements under the Goonda Act is often more effective than rowdy parades that we do periodically,” a senior police officer said.

Some of the rowdy sheeters booked under the Goonda Act in September are Vinay Kumar, 30, a history sheeter from Mahalakshmi Layout facing 17 cases, including murder and extortion; Dayanand, 28, a history sheeter at Ashok Nagar and Koramangala police stations who is named in over 13 cases; Srikanth, 30, with over 12 cases, including murder and robbery in Malleswaram, Vyalikaval and Mandya.

Police have arrested four rowdy sheeters from D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli under the Goonda Act: Khaleel Ahmed, 35, involved in crimes, including assault, robbery, and kidnap since 2006; Suhail, 34, with seven cases, including attempt to murder, robbery and assault; Rizwan, 35, involved in 14 cases, including murder and robbery apart from threatening witnesses; and Anis Ahmed, 28, involved in 16 cases, including murder and extortion since 2010.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/seven-rowdies-booked-under-goonda-act/article32746004.ece

410,2020/10/01,Cycling lanes to come up in CBD,"They will be spread over 30 km of roads

The community of cyclists in the core city area will soon have reason to cheer. Around 30 km of roads in the Central Business District, which have been taken up for upgradation under the Smart Cities Mission, will have dedicated cycle lanes by the year-end. In addition, several stretches in and around Cubbon Park – totalling 15 km – will have also cycle lanes.

The width of the cycle lanes in the CBD will be around two metres. They will be part of Cycling District 2.

The Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT), in collaboration with WRI India, has prepared a detailed design drawing for the 5-km stretch from Minsk Square and Raj Bhavan Road to Chalukya Circle. Bengaluru Smart City Limited has already begun the work, which will be completed by November 1, said officials.

Cycling District 1 – work on which is under way – is spread across 25 wards in and around the Outer Ring Road (ORR) stretch between Silk Board Junction and Lowry Memorial College junction near K.R. Puram, Old Madras Road. It is being undertaken by the BBMP in collaboration with DULT.

Hephsiba Rani Korlapati, Managing Director, Bengaluru Smart City Limited, said that most of the stretches in the CBD that had been taken up for redevelopment had now been integrated with the cycling infrastructure. “Along with cycling lanes, proper lighting facilities, footpaths and resting spots are being executed keeping in mind optimal utilisation of space,” she said.

She added that inputs from cycling enthusiasts and the Karnataka State Reserve Police (KSRP) personnel have been taken while identifying ‘pain points’. “Pain points include huge junctions, long and wide crossings, discontinuation of stretches,” she said.

This year has seen important developments that will give a much-needed boost to the city’s cycling community. On June 24, the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) announced that the Kempegowda International Airport will be open for cyclists every Sunday from 6 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. Work on the cycle lane along the bus priority lane on Outer Ring Road (ORR) is set to begin next week.

“This is just the beginning,” said Bengaluru’s bicycle mayor Sathya Sankaran. The cycling community is planning more initiatives to increase its presence in the city. Sankaran and his team are awaiting applicants for its Bicycle Councillor program, which was launched in March. The program intends to have a ‘bicycle councillor’ for each of the 198 wards in the city.

“We had to put it on hold due to the pandemic, but will be accepting the first round of the applications till the end of October,” said Mr. Sankaran.

“Each ward has a different socio-economic setup. The plan is to work with people from these wards on setting up cycling clubs and identifying unsafe junctions, among other things” he added.

A handwritten letter of Mahatma Gandhi to the secretary of Congress, a week before he started the Dandi March to defy the salt tax from Sabarmati Ashram, are among three of his memorabilia that are going under the hammer in Bengaluru on Gandhi Jayanti on Friday.

While a physical auction is taking place in the city, bids are being invited online too.

The letter in English, dated March 6, 1930, with a personal letterhead of ‘Gandhi Niwas , Rajkot, India’, is written in blue ink.

The letter just says: “I will go next Sunday. All the member should present in the meeting. The meeting is very important for us.” The Mahatma signed the letter as ‘MK Gandhi’.

He commenced the 240-mile, 24-day Dandi March on March 12 as part of the Civil Disobedience Movement and tax resistance. While the letter was written on a Thursday, the “next Sunday” was March 9. The important meeting that he was referring to could be a meeting ahead of the Dandi march.

Rajender Maru of Marudhar Arts, one of the few ASI-licenced auction houses in India, which is auctioning the memorabilia, said that the other handwritten letter of the Mahatma is in Gujarati. The letter received by Kumar Ranjit Singhji, the ruler of Nawanagar, on April 12, 1939, is written in blue ink on handmade paper, which is still in good condition.

The third item is a rare black-and-white photograph of the Mahatma with an undated signature in Hindi in black ink as ‘M.K. Gandhi’.

412,2020/10/01,COVID-19 cases breach six lakh mark in Karnataka,"Nearly 43% of this caseload reported in September

Nearly seven months after recording its first COVID-19 case, Karnataka breached the six lakh mark and hit 6,01,767 cases, as 8,856 more people tested positive on Wednesday. Nearly 43% of the caseload has been reported in September alone. This brings Karnataka to the third position in the country, after Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.

With 1,07,616 active cases as on Wednesday, Karnataka is in the second position among States after Maharashtra on this count. Fuelled by an increase in cases in Bengaluru, the situation in Karnataka took a turn for the worse from the beginning of July by breaching the daily 2,000 mark initially. It subsequently jumped to over 5,000 a day, and later to over 9,000 cases. On Tuesday, the State saw a record 10,453 cases, the highest single-day jump so far.

With 87 deaths on Wednesday, the toll touched 8,864. This is apart from 19 non-COVID deaths. Nearly 36% of COVID-19 fatalities in the State were reported in September. The State’s Case Fatality Rate (CFR) now stands at 1.47%.

This September, the State added 2,59,344 cases of which 1,05,327 are in Bengaluru Urban alone. On Wednesday, Bengaluru Urban recorded 4,226 cases and 24 deaths. With this, the total number of cases in this district touched 2,32,663 and deaths have shot up to 2,936.

With 8,890 discharges on Wednesday, the total number of recoveries in the State is now 4,85,268. As many as 821 patients are being monitored in the ICUs of various designated hospitals.

Steady rise since June

From 101 cases in March, the State witnessed a four-fold rise in April and subsequently a six-fold increase in May. From May to June there was a five-fold rise and then an eight-fold increase from June to July when the number of cases crossed one lakh and touched 1,08,873. As many as 2,068 deaths were reported this month. Since then, the numbers more than doubled and touched 2,18,308 in August while fatalities rose to 3,388.

The number of positive cases in the State have been rising steadily since the beginning of June and 80% of the total 10,118 positive cases reported as of June 24 were from June alone.

Highest number of tests

The State on Wednesday registered the highest number of tests conducted in a single day, with 94,886 tests in the last 24 hours.

413,2020/10/01,How lockdown pushed car collectors in Chennai to buy more vintage models,"Chennaiites caught a glimpse of the city’s vintage cars recently, as the classic automobiles and their owners took a stroll for the first time since the lockdown in March

The Chevrolet Fleetmaster is a bonafide headturner; one of those cars that was oft-featured in films of the 1950s, ‘60s and ‘70s.

The novelty of having grown up around the car is perhaps what makes the Fleetmaster a coveted possession among vintage car enthusiasts in the city.

The lockdown, however, made it harder for the collectors to connect with their passion, especially since these automobiles need to be tended to a lot more than your average car.

“It was such a hassle. We didn’t have the mechanics and the shops were also shut. These cars have to be started at least once a month. If you don’t, the brakes get jammed, the carburettors get clogged, and because our fuel content is high on sulphur, we also encounter a lot of issues with the cars’ fuel systems, if left unattended,” says Ranjit Pratap, managing director, Rayala Corporation.

But the lockdown was also a blessing in disguise, for these hobbyists also bought cars like never before. Ranjit, who owns 85 vintage cars, describes the situation with a laugh: “An idle mind is the devil’s workshop,” and adds that he purchased six vintage models — including a Toyota Camry and a 1975 Toyota Land Cruiser. “I have no place left to park in my garage now,” he exclaims.

Durable passion

This past Sunday, for the first time since lockdown in March, as many as 15 vintage cars, including the aforementioned Fleetmaster, rolled down Kamarajar Salai near Marina Beach for much-needed fresh air; the cars and its owners embarked on a short rally towards OMR.

“It is a nice feeling since the pandemic restricted us from moving around for so long. But this is a passion and we want to share the enthusiasm,” says Ranjit, who is also president of Historical Cars Association of India.

“We usually do activities for Madras Week, which wasn’t possible this year. So we thought we would combine both occasions and organised the rally,” he adds.

Held to mark World Tourism Day, which fell on September 27, the rally had a 1949 Cadillac, a 1949 Buick, a Mini Cooper, Jaguars, Mustangs and Mercedes’ besides other vintage models.

“If the situation gets better next year, we plan on doing more rallies and exhibitions as before,” says Ranjit.

At 60, VS Kylas, who is the secretary of Historical Cars Association of India — and for whom owning a vintage car is not just about the novelty — describes himself as a “do-it-yourself” person when it comes to restoring his cars.

“These cars were built to last generations,” he says. Likewise for V Durai Mohan, who owns Varadharaja theatre in Chitlapakkam, and for whom collecting vintage cars started as a serious business over 25 years ago. He counts the 1924 Chevrolet in his garage as the most prized among the dozen vintage cars he owns.

Their passion is set to carry over to the next generation. A good example is one of the participants at Sunday’s rally, 24-year-old Abhinav Shankar, the son of Shankar Sundaram of Amalgamations Group.

The Automobile Engineering student calls himself an aspiring collector, and speaks passionately of gasoline-powered cars.

The first time he drove a vintage car was a few months after he turned 18, when his father asked him to drive the 1975 Mini 1275 GT to the Puducherry rally. “It is something that has since grown on me,” he says.

Prior to the pandemic, vintage car owners routinely convened for a weekend trip to Mamallapuram. Ranjit now encourages automobile lovers to take enough safeguards and slowly resume pursuing their interests, like going on a road trip.

“This pandemic is not going to leave us at least for the next one year or so. I’m not saying we should be careless, but we cannot lock ourselves up. You have to be cautious, take enough precautions and then enjoy yourself to the extent possible.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8k2hph/article32744105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPVINTAGE-8,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/how-lockdown-pushed-car-collectors-in-chennai-to-buy-more-vintage-models/article32744115.ece
414,2020/10/01,Chennai Corporation to start issuing new voter identity cards,"‘The linking of Aadhaar card with EPIC was also being seriously considered but no decision has been taken by the ECI till now’

Chennai Corporation would start distributing Electoral Photo Identity Cards (EPIC) to new voters in the city from October first week.

The civic body has completed the three revision activities of rationalisation of polling stations, removing duplicate entries and carrying out corrections in the electoral rolls and would start distributing the voter ID cards, said officials.

A senior official of the Corporation said all arrangements are being made to distribute 27,000 new voter cards. All the Booth Level Officers (BLOs), including a section of BLOs who were involved in COVID-19 have been reassigned for completing the summary revision of the electoral rolls for 2020-21.

The civic body, as part of the electoral updating exercise, has created a progress tracker for the various works being performed by the various election staff with senior officials getting information of the summary revision through computer generated reports.

He further said that the electoral updation works of inclusion, correction and removal of the voters by the BLOs are being coordinated and checked by the Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) and Assistant Electoral Registration Officers (AEROs).

Regarding the queries and complaints of voters for inclusion or carrying out corrections of any mistakes to be carried out in the voters list, the civic official said the public could easily update the details by accessing the portal www.nsvp.in at all times, that too during the COVID-19 pandemic without the need to visit the corporation offices.

Though the summary revision of electoral rolls is a continuous process of updation a few residents have grievances of their voter identification cards being error-prone with mismatched photos and typing errors of personal details including names and addresses repeatedly.

V. Rama Rao, social activist of Nanganallur - one of the added areas to the corporation, complained that in the new EPIC issued recently some other person's photo was affixed replacing his original photo though he had not made any complaint. He also rued about several mistakes noticed in the voter identification cards in the locality and charged that the revenue officials of Kancheepuram district were not taking any steps to rectify them.

Regarding the complaint raised by the residents in the newly added areas, the senior civic official said the city should be having 22 revenue districts after expansion by including portions from the neighbouring three districts but was demarcated with 16 revenue districts for electoral works. The delimitation of revenue districts should be carried out by the Election Commission of India (ECI) only, he said.

The linking of Aadhaar card with EPIC was also being seriously considered but no decision has been taken by the ECI till now, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sut4b1/article32743177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EPIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-corporation-to-start-issuing-new-voter-identity-cards/article32743178.ece
415,2020/10/01,SPB’s friends go down memory lane,"He was a constant teacher for me, throughout my life: Mano

Members of the film fraternity, family and friends came together on Wednesday to take part in a prayer meeting for playback singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, who passed away on September 25.

Several actors, directors and singers reminisced about the singer.

“Many of us learnt how to treat others from him. Having travelled with him for concerts, we saw how respectful he was towards the musicians who used to perform with him,” singer Chitra recalled.

She said she had sung the maximum number of songs with SPB in the course of her career. “He used to help me a lot in how to pronounce and understand Telugu when we recorded songs together,” she said.

Singer Unni Menon said he had learnt immensely from the senior singer during their travels and concerts together.

Music composer Vidyasagar said the singer’s death was like the loss of a family member for all.

SPB was famous not just for his singing prowess but also for the human being that he was, he said.

“He was a constant teacher for me, throughout my life,” singer Mano said.

Actors Venkatesh, Sivakumar and Nasser and director Bharathiraja were among those who reflected on their association with the singer through video messages.

In an emotional message, composer Gangai Amaran, a close friend of the singer for years, said SPB’s death was an irreplaceable loss.

Actors Parthiepan, Jayaram, Karthi and Prasanna, composers Srikanth Deva and Devi Sri Prasad and directors P.

416,2020/10/01,Villupuram-Nagapattinam stretch of East Coast Road to be widened soon,"Widening of the 180-km-long stretch of East Coast Road (ECR) from Villupuram to Nagapattinam is expected to commence in a couple of months with land acquisition at an advanced stage. The road will be made into a four-lane facility.

“We have to hand over at least 80% of the required land to the contractors before the work commences and that is nearing completion. By January, we can expect the works to begin. The widening of the Sirkali to Nagapattinam stretch will begin by November,” explained an official of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).

Though bids had already been called for stretches from Cuddalore to Puducherry and Sirkali, the contracts had to be terminated since the land could not be handed over in time. Land acquisition for the Sirkali-Nagapattinam stretch was at an advanced stage, the official added.

The ₹6,000 crore project would have underpasses and inter-changing ramps every 2 km.

“It will also help in segregation of local traffic, and prevent accidents. Similar facilities have been provided on the Coimbatore-Perundurai route,” an official explained.

The work, which will include the construction of 60 bridges, will take between 24 and 30 months.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/villupuram-nagapattinam-stretch-of-east-coast-road-to-be-widened-soon/article32736726.ece
417,2020/10/01,Fishermen from Ennore stage protest at Kamarajar Port,"They demand a permanent solution to the estuary’s silting

Fishermen belonging to eight villages along the Ennore Creek staged a protest on Wednesday demanding a permanent solution to the silting of the creek’s estuary.

The two ports north of the creek and the thermal power stations were leading to silting of the estuary and erosion of coastline.

“Earlier, we had a dredger working round the clock to remove silt. About four or five years ago, it was stopped. Now we have a couple of earth movers parked there doing nothing. We need the old dredging system back,” said Kalaivanan of Nettukuppam.

The fishermen said industries and ports had prevented the movement of the current towards the north, which had led to sand getting deposited in the wrong place, causing depletion of the coast.

Fishermen from Nettukuppam, Thalangkuppam, Ennorekuppam, Sivanpadaiveedukuppam, Chinnakuppam, Periyakuppam, Mugadwarakuppam and Kattukuppam blockaded the entry/exit point to the Kamarajar Port in an effort to draw the attention of the State government.

“We have written so many letters to the district administration and the government but it has been of no use. We blockaded the port to show our protest. We also want steps to be taken to protect the mangroves in our area. They have been damaged beyond repair,” said Desappan, a fisherman.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vyuck9/article32736695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30SEPTHENNORECREEK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fishermen-from-ennore-stage-protest-at-kamarajar-port/article32736696.ece
418,2020/10/01,Anglo-Indian community wants to be designated separate minority,"Anglo-Indian Suburban Front submits memorandum to Prime Minister

The Anglo-Indian community has urged the Central government to grant them the status of a separate minority and to take steps to restore and extend the special reservation for nomination of the community’s members to Parliament and the State Assemblies.

In a memorandum to the Prime Minister, Augustine Roy Rozario, founder-president, Anglo-Indian Suburban Front, sought the status of a separate minority for the community by amending the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, as done for the Jain community in 2014, to protect the ethnic, linguistic, tradition and culture of the Anglo-Indian community.

He appealed for urgent steps to restore and extend the special reservation for the nomination of Anglo-Indian members to Parliament and the State Assemblies beyond January 26 for a period of 10 years.

This, he said, was shelved in the 126th Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2019, based on an “erroneous enumeration” done in the 2011 Census.

This was the only Constitutional guarantee left for the community to safeguard its interests, he said in the memorandum. Though the community comprises Christians, they have different ethnic and linguistic characteristics.

The memorandum pointed out the abolishing or denying of Constitutional rights to Anglo-Indians, including the abolishment of the 5% job reservation in 1960 and the stopping of educational grants.

Leaders of 11 major Anglo-Indian associations met the Union Law Minister on January 28 and submitted a memorandum clarifying that the population of the community was around 4 lakh and not 296 as mentioned in the 2011 Census. They sought his intervention in this issue, and on the proposal of extension of special reservation for Anglo-Indians but it was yet to be decided by the Central government, the memorandum said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/anglo-indian-community-wants-to-be-designated-separate-minority/article32736688.ece
419,2020/10/01,Madras High Court clears Chakra’s release on OTT platforms,"Trident Arts filed case against the film which stars Vishal Krishna.

The Madras High Court on Wednesday refused to extend an order of status quo granted by it last week against the release of actor Vishal Krishna-starrer Chakra on Over the Top (OTT) platforms following a case filed by Trident Arts, producers of his previous film Action.

Justice N. Sathish Kumar rejected the plea for extending the interim order and directed the Registry to list the case for hearing on Monday since the actor and director M. Anand of Chakra had filed counter-affidavits denying all claims made by the proprietor of Trident Arts.

Advocate Krishna Ravindran, representing the actor, told the court that Chakra had been produced by Vishal Film Factory (VFF) and no restraint order could be issued against its release on OTT platforms on the basis of alleged violation of an agreement entered for Action.

Stating that Chakra was almost ready for release, he accused Trident Arts of attempting to blackmail the actor-producer by filing the case and obtaining interim orders.

It was also brought to the notice of the court that the proprietor of Trident Arts wanted the actor to act in another film under its banner to make up for the shortfall in theatre collections of Action and the actor also agreed to do so sometime next year.

“However, the applicant wanted the actor to start shooting right away and because of this led to a fallout between the two partiescaused a strain in relationship had strained and my client is upset now,” Mr. Ravindran said. He added that the producer did not appear to be genuinely interested in settling the dispute.

Chakra’s director Anand also filed a counter affidavit in support of the actor and urged the court to dismiss the case filed by Trident Arts.

Financier Chandraprakash Jain too moved an application in support of the actor since he had lent ₹12 crore for the production of Chakra.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/madras-high-court-clears-chakras-release-on-ott-platforms/article32736687.ece

421,2020/10/01,"Student visas are high priority, says U.S. Consul General","Processing began in the middle of August: Judith Ravin

Student visas are high priority, and the U.S. Consulate in Chennai had started processing them in the middle of August, Judith Ravin, Consul General of the United States of America in Chennai, said on Wednesday.

Ms. Ravin, who took charge as the Consul General recently, said the pandemic had curtailed operations at the consulate. As part of the U.S. Department of State’s ‘Diplomacy Strong’ initiative, a phased approach on which services could be offered while keeping the staff and the public safe was being adopted.

“Student visas are really high priority… In the middle of August, we started processing student visas, cognisant of our priority of handling the workload that was possible to keep people safe. That continues, and we would like to see more than two lakh Indian students because international students internationalise our campuses. The diversity Indian students bring is very important,” Ms. Ravin said in an interview to The Hindu.

When asked if there was interest among students to apply to U.S. universities, considering that there had been confusion over student visas of late, she replied in the affirmative.

“Yes. That’s why we are organising an education fair. We are having a very large virtual university graduate fair coming Friday and Saturday and a week later, we are having the undergraduate fair,” she added.

Renovation process

The Consul General said the consulate was set to undergo renovation to modernise facilities and create a more functional environment.

When asked how the consulate was planning to hold events like it used to before the pandemic disrupted normal life, Ms. Ravin said it was creating more virtual programmes and using virtual platforms for events on intellectual property rights, arts and sciences, and an upcoming series in November-December for those curating museums.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wfmevt/article32736667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30SEPTHJUDITHRAVIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/student-visas-are-high-priority-says-us-consul-general/article32736668.ece
422,2020/10/01,Chennai airport will begin handling additional flights soon,"Tamil Nadu government gives nod to increase arrivals from other States

Air traffic in the city will go up now as the State government has given permission to allow the arrival of 100 flights a day from other States.

In May, the Tamil Nadu government put in place a cap of 25 arrival flights from other States in an attempt to control the number of COVID-19 cases. Later, it was increased to 50 flights a day and now it has gone up to 100.

On several occasions, officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) sought to add more flights since the airport’s passenger traffic was too low. In the last few weeks, there has been a spike in the number of passengers. From about 3,000-3,500 passengers a day at the time of reopening, the footfalls have now touched 10,000-12,000.

“Next month, we are hoping to see a further growth in traffic as the number of flights operated will be high. We will have 100 arrival flights from other States and in addition, there will be flights from within the State as well,” an official said.

The increase in the number of flights would not be reflected immediately, officials said.

The airlines will be given slots and depending on the demand, they will draw up a schedule. “It will gradually increase over the next few days and may take a week for the numbers to touch over 100,” an official added.

423,2020/10/01,‘State govt. fully competent to direct deemed varsities to obtain NOC for agri courses’,"The State government on Wednesday asserted before the Madras High Court that it was fully competent to direct deemed universities in the State to obtain no objection certificates (NOCs) from it for conducting agriculture and allied courses.

Appearing before Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, Advocate General Vijay Narayan said agricultural research and education falls under Entry 14 of List II (State list) of the seventh schedule to the Constitution.

He pointed out that Entry 66 of List I (Union list) in the seventh schedule states that co-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions would fall under the domain of the Centre.

However, Entry 14 of List II makes it clear that “agriculture, including agricultural education and research, protection against pests and prevention of plant diseases,” would fall under the domain of the State government and the State would be fully competent to control those subjects.

The A-G made the submissions during the hearing of a writ petition filed by Karunya Institute of Technology which had challenged a government order issued on July 28 directing all deemed universities to obtain NOC within six months and not to admit new students till then.

He informed the first Division Bench that two other deemed universities SRM Institute of Technology and Vellore Institute of Technology had filed individual writ petitions challenging the same GO and obtained an interim stay from a single judge of the court on Tuesday.

When the Chief Justice asked why were those writ petitions listed before a single judge when the present petition had been listed before the Division Bench, the A-G said he was also equally mystified as to why the Registry listed the cases before different judges.

He stated that the interim stay had been obtained by those two universities even without serving papers on the State Government Pleader’s office. “We came to know of the interim order only through a newspaper report this morning,” the A-G added.

After hearing him, the Chief Justice’s Bench called for an explanation from the Registry for having listed the writ petitions on the same issue before different judges and also directed it to list all the three writ petitions together before the Division Bench on October 6.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/state-govt-fully-competent-to-direct-deemed-varsities-to-obtain-noc-for-agri-courses/article32736586.ece
424,2020/10/01,"On the Quad, define the idea, chart a path","A positive regional agenda built around collective action by the Quad members will also take care of China’s shrillness

It is reported that the second Ministerial meeting of the four countries under the Quad will be held in Japan. Sadly, the person who conceived this idea, Shinzō Abe, has stepped down as the Prime Minister of Japan. Mr. Abe was a strategic thinker who thought beyond the limited timeframe of Japanese revolving-door politics. In 2007, the Quad (the United States, Japan, India, and Australia) was an idea whose time had not yet come. That was a different world.

An evolution

The global financial crisis was still lurking in the shadows as America continued to enjoy its ‘unipolar moment’. The American establishment still believed that it could, somehow, persuade China to become a ‘responsible stake-holder’ and, in any case, required Chinese goodwill in dealing with America’s priorities — the nuclear issue with North Korea and Iran, and the War on Terror. Japan and Australia were riding the China Boom to prosperity. If India was ambivalent at the time, it was because this mirrored the uncertainties of others.

Quad | The confluence of four powers and two seas

China’s shrill reaction to the idea of four like-minded countries establishing a plurilateral platform was, prima facie, intriguing. The idea was barely on the table; there was no clearly enunciated concept or proposed structures, much less joint understandings. The Chinese, however, labelled it as an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It became evident years later that the real reason for China’s hyperreaction was out of concern that such a grouping would “out” China’s plans for naval expansion by focusing on the Indo-Pacific maritime space. China was hoping that its naval build-up might slip under the radar because the Americans were distracted by continental challenges including Russia, Afghanistan and Iran, and would not look sea-ward.

Once the idea of Quad 1.0 had died down, China gained in confidence to reveal its hand. It advanced a new claim — the Nine-Dash Line — in the South China Sea; it undertook the rapid kind of warship building activity reminiscent of Wilhelmine Germany before 1914; it built its first overseas base in Djibouti; and it started systematically to explore the surface and sub-surface environment in the Indian Ocean beyond the Malacca Straits. This entire activity was coordinated by a Central Leading Small Group for Protecting Maritime Rights and Interests, established in 2012. The manner of China’s dismissal of the Arbitral Award in the dispute with the Philippines on the South China Sea and its brazen militarisation of the islands after its President had publicly pronounced to the contrary, has once again brought the four countries onto the same page and given a second chance to the Quad.

A plurilateral mechanism

The Chinese are skilled at obfuscation. They will, perhaps, endeavour to conflate the Quad with the Indo-Pacific vision, and link both to the so-called China Containment Theory. The Quad nations need to better explain that the Indo-Pacific Vision is an overarching framework that is being discussed in a transparent manner, with the objective of advancing everyone’s economic and security interests. The Quad, on the other hand, is a plurilateral mechanism between countries that share interest on specific matters.

Editorial | A new dimension: On India-U.S.-Australia-Japan Quadrilateral

There are other such mechanisms in the region. In 2016, China itself established a Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination Mechanism with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan and, more recently earlier this year, another one with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nepal. The Quad is no exception.

The world today

This time around, the four countries are navigating through more turbulent waters. The global pandemic and the faltering global economy are taking a toll on the region’s growth and prosperity. The two major Pacific powers (China and America), are moving into a more adversarial phase of their relationship. Public opinion about China in all four countries is different from what it used to be in 2007. The fact of the meeting itself will signal to China that assertive or aggressive behaviour is not going to derail this mechanism. The forthcoming Ministerial meeting will be an opportunity to define the idea and chart a future path. Needless provocation of China should be avoided. There is no gain in actions that anger the Chinese with no commensurate benefit to the others.

In a recent address to the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) on August 31, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Stephen Biegun, spoke about making sure that all the countries were moving at the same speed. This is an important statement because a plurilateral mechanism should also serve national interest. He also suggested that other countries might be invited to join in the future. This too is welcome; India has many other partners in the Indo-Pacific.

Comment | Is the Quad rising after China’s challenge at the LAC?

Reaching out

A positive agenda built around collective action in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, monitoring shipping for search and rescue or anti-piracy operations, infrastructure assistance to climatically vulnerable states, connectivity initiatives and similar activities, will re-assure the littoral States that the Quad will be a factor for regional benefit, and a far cry from Chinese allegations that it is some sort of a military alliance.

Also Read Time to shift focus to the maritime sphere

An outreach to the Indian Ocean littoral states is especially important since there are motivated reports from some quarters suggesting that India is, somehow, seeking to deny access, or to create infrastructure that impedes the legitimate movement of some extra-regional countries through the Indian Ocean. Prime Minister Abe had presciently said in the Central Hall of the Parliament of India on August 22, 2007 (https://bit.ly/2HFYS45) - “A ‘broader Asia’ that broke away geographical boundaries is now beginning to take on a distinct form.” It is the right time to realise Mr. Abe’s dreams.

425,2020/10/01,Time to shift focus to the maritime sphere,"India’s obsession with continental strategies has yielded unflattering results — no secure borders or deterrence stability

For a country that has been traditionally obsessed with a continental approach to war and peace, India’s continental ‘grand’ strategy is facing an existential crisis today. Given that reconciliation with its key adversaries, China and Pakistan, is unlikely at this point and pursuing its ambitious territorial claims on the ground is almost impossible, New Delhi’s continental options seem restricted to holding operations to prevent further territorial loss. Put differently, New Delhi’s grand strategic plans in the continental space may have reached a dead end.

State of continental strategy

The current state of India’s continental strategies is hardly flattering. China has begun to push the boundaries with India, quite literally so, and Beijing is neither keen on ending the ongoing border stalemate nor reinstating the status quo with India as of March 2020. The peaceful India-China Line of Actual Control in the Northeast is now a thing of the past with China pushing back New Delhi’s claims on Aksai Chin and New Delhi defending against Beijing’s expansive territorial claims and their slow but aggressive implementation. China has crossed the red line with India and India’s LAC with China is not going to be the same ever again: It is the beginning of a long, bitter winter in the Himalayan borders between the two Asian giants.

Comment | A case of a maritime presence adrift

In the Northwest, the Pakistan front has also been heating up. Ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC) have spiked since last year as has the infiltration of terrorists across the LoC. With the change of the status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) by New Delhi in 2019, and Pakistan altering its political map a few months ago to include all of J&K, the India-Pakistan contestation over Kashmir has become fiercer. Equally important is the geopolitical collusion between Islamabad and Beijing to contain and pressure New Delhi from both sides. While this is not a new phenomenon, the intensity of the China-Pakistan containment strategy against India today is unprecedented. The extent and intent behind this collusion will determine the future of the high stakes game in the Himalayas for a long time to come.

Changes in Afghanistan

The ongoing withdrawal of the United States from Afghanistan (the loss of a friend in the region for New Delhi, and the consequent reduction of India’s influence in Afghanistan) and the return of the Taliban, with whom India has very little contact, could turn the geopolitical tide against New Delhi — similar to the situation in the early 1990s. But unlike in the 1990s, tables have turned in Afghanistan: the Taliban is no more an outcaste, and with the withdrawal of forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from Afghanistan, the geopolitical interests of Pakistan, China and Russia would broadly converge in the region. The change of the geopolitical landscape in Afghanistan and the frictions in Iran-India relations will further dampen India’s ‘Mission Central Asia’. In sum, this is perhaps the end of the road for New Delhi’s north-eastern and north-western geopolitical forays.

For sure, India needs to find a way out of this situation. One key part of the solution is to creatively deal with its continental dilemmas. To begin with, New Delhi must seek ways to break up the ‘nutcracker situation’ that the Pakistani and Chinese strategies have forced India into. To do so, India would need to deal with the comparatively easier part first — the Pakistan front. Pressure from the Pakistan front could be eased by addressing the Kashmir question with Islamabad. Creating a modicum of normalcy on the LoC by activating existing mechanisms such as the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) hotline is another way to deal with the Pakistan front. However, there is little appetite in New Delhi to do so. So, unless there is political will in New Delhi to put in place a strategy to address the Pakistan front, there will be little respite from the nutcracker situation that it faces today. And yet, it is time for New Delhi to think beyond its continental fixation.

Comment | Putting the SAGAR vision to the test

Maritime strategy explained

It appears abundantly clear now that New Delhi’s excessive focus on the continental sphere since Independence has not yielded great returns in terms of secure borders, healthy relations with its neighbours or deterrence stability vis-à-vis adversaries. If so, it is time for India to change its grand strategic approach — by shifting its almost exclusive focus from the continental sphere to the maritime sphere. Clearly, New Delhi has already begun to think in this direction with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) establishing a new division to deal with the Indo-Pacific in April 2019. The work in this direction, both ideational and practical, needs to be fast-tracked to keep pace with the emerging realities and to make use of new opportunities.

There are several reasons why a maritime grand strategy would work to India’s advantage while still struggling with a continental dilemma. To begin with, unlike in the continental sphere where India seems to be hemmed in by China-Pakistan collusion, the maritime sphere is wide open to India to undertake coalition building, rule setting, and other forms of strategic exploration.

Comment | Make the right call on ‘Malabar’ going Quad

Visualise this: while India seems stuck between Pakistan and China from a continental perspective, the country is located right at the centre of the Indo-Pacific geopolitical imagination, in the midst of the oceanic space spanning “from the shores of Africa to that of the Americas”, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi put it at the Shangri La Dialogue two years ago, on June 1, 2018.

Second, unlike in the continental sphere, there is a growing great power interest in the maritime sphere, especially with the arrival of the concept of ‘Indo-Pacific’. The Euro-American interest in India’s land borders with Pakistan and China is negligible, and more so, there is little any country can do to help India in its continental contestations. The situation in the maritime sphere is the exact opposite: great powers remain ever more interested in the maritime sphere and this interest has grown substantially since the coinage of Indo-Pacific. For instance, Germany recently released its Indo-Pacific guidelines following the example of France which brought out its Indo-Pacific strategy last year.

Third, Beijing’s bullying behaviour in the South China Sea in particular and the region in general has generated a great deal of willingness among the Euro-American powers and the countries of the region, including Australia and Japan, to push back Chinese unilateralism. This provides New Delhi with a unique opportunity to enhance its influence and potentially checkmate the Chinese ambitions in the region.

Comment | All out at sea: India’s engagements in the Indian Ocean

Finally, the maritime space is a lot more important to China than engaging in opportunistic land grab attempts in the Himalayas, thanks to the massive Chinese trade that happens via the Oceanic routes and the complex geopolitics around the maritime chokepoints which can potentially disrupt that trade.

A revitalised Indian maritime grand strategy may or may not checkmate China in the Himalayas; it may even prompt Beijing to increase pressure there. But it will certainly provide New Delhi a lot more space for manoeuvre in the region and message Beijing that its Himalayan adventure could become costly for it. New Delhi must use its Indo-Pacific engagements to dissuade Beijing from salami-slicing Indian territory in the high Himalayas.

Quad | The confluence of four powers and two seas

Think beyond a division

Therefore, it is high time New Delhi shifted its almost exclusive focus from the continental space to the maritime space, stitching together a maritime grand strategy. The MEA’s Indo-Pacific Division is a good beginning; so is the decision in 2019 to elevate the Quad meetings among India, Japan, the United States and Australia to the ministerial level. New Delhi would do well to ideate on the current and future maritime challenges, consolidate its military and non-military tools, engage its strategic partners, and publish a comprehensive vision document on the Indo-Pacific; the current ‘Indo-Pacific Division Briefs’ document put out by the MEA does not make the cut. More so, New Delhi should consider appointing a special envoy for Indo-Pacific affairs.

The Asian geopolitical chessboard awaits bold moves by New Delhi.

426,2020/10/01,"Letters to the Editor — October 1, 2020","All acquitted

The stark contradictions that plague the Babri Masjid demolition case verdict force one to question the judicial objectivity of courts in India.

The watershed judgment is in spite of the multitude of evidence in the form of visuals, news reports, speeches and even verbal testimonials about the involvement of those acquitted in the demolition. The verdict comes at an inopportune time as the halting of Amnesty International’s activities, which has focused global attention on the country. It is quite disconcerting as the secular credentials that India has upheld since Independence have been subjected to the opprobrium of the international media.

India’s virus ‘peak’

The writers of the article, “Imperatives after India’s September virus peak” (Editorial page, September 29), claim that the country has reached the peak of the epidemic curve, but this assertion is based on a flawed assumption. Observing the currently decreasing trend of average daily reported cases of 85,156 (September 19-25) from the figure of 91,801 (during the fortnight of September 5-18) is good news, but suffers some faults in modelling. The faults lie in the: assumption of the COVID-19 positive or silently infected population to be around 480-600 million based on the ICMR Survey Round-1 (May 11-June 4); the sero-positivity rate of 0.73%, whereby it is inferred that for every RT-PCR positive case there were 82-130 undocumented infections. When we apply this correction factor — as the writers rightly did — we have already reached a figure of above 35% of India’s total population. But the ICMR, just a day after the article, published a revised sero-positivity rate of 6.6% in Round-2 (August 17-September 22) of the result released recently. Thereby, the community-level of infection is only 26-32 infections per reported cases, say 30 times that which is lab confirmed. This will reduce the presumed hidden community infection to 192 million (30% of 1,380 million, which is the total population of India) — way behind the 414 million minimum level of the population which needs to be infected for herd immunity.

This must be an eye-opener. But let us not have unrealistic consolation. We still have densely populated mosaics all over the country where the virus has not reached. When will it reach and explode after the ‘Unlocking’ steps we cannot predict if we apply maturity of wisdom rather than relying on partially-known epidemiology.

There are other greats such as M.S. Viswanathan, T.M. Soundararajan and even Illaiyaraja to name a few who too can be considered. Dr. Balamuralikrishna shone like a beacon in classical Carnatic music and the celluloid world. He was a great popular singer, innovator par excellence and composer par excellence. When alive, his fans wished the award to be conferred on him, but this does not seem to have reached the ears of those in the hierarchy who decide the awards. It is meaningful to show recognition when the person is alive and well.

427,2020/10/01,Chandrakala and Suryakala: A sugary twist on the gujiya from Thanjavur’s iconic eatery,"Be sure to sample these unique offerings from the temple city’s Bombay Sweets, that has grown from a small tuck shop to an e-commerce savvy business

BG Subramani Sharma, managing director of Bombay Sweets, smiles when he answers a question on when he entered the business in Thanjavur. “I started assisting my father Guru Dayal Sharma when I was in Class XI, mainly with measuring out the ingredients and learning how to knead the dough for samosa. I was nicknamed maida maavu by my classmates because I would come to school straight from the kitchen with flour on my hands,” he says.

There is a hum of activity at this 10,000 square-feet industrial kitchen complex in Thanjavur, even though lockdown restrictions have mandated a reduced staff strength. Teams of men and women are preparing a host of snacks and savouries that will be displayed and sold at the store’s 14 branches in Thanjavur and Pattukottai.

Clearly, it’s been a long journey, from a small tuck shop opposite Thanjavur railway station in 1949 to an e-commerce savvy business today.

“My father was a traditional sweet maker in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, who migrated down South in the 1940s, and after working for a short while in Madras, settled down in Thanjavur. He was a master chef who believed in using the best ingredients,” says Sharma. “He loved every step of cooking — he would begin his day listening to Surdas bhajans while slicing cashew nuts. He remained as enthused about his work in his later years, as when he was starting out.”

Bite-sized inspiration

Since 1949, Bombay Sweets (named so by Sharma Senior because the city symbolised sophistication and novelty to him, even though he had never actually been there), is a favourite snack food destination for both local residents and tourists in Thanjavur. While the original menu has expanded from North Indian snacks to include Southern Indian tiffin items and fast food, its best-sellers are the sweets Chandrakala and Suryakala, a Guru Dayal innovation that combines the best of north and south festive cuisines.

These are little fried pastry parcels filled with khoya or mawa (whole dried milk) mixed with nuts and seasoned delicately with saffron and cardamom powder, then dipped in a light sugar syrup.

“For this recipe, my father was inspired by the gujiya, a dry fried pastry that is commonly prepared for festivals like Holi in the North. Chandrakala and suryakala, both of which have the same filling, get a southern Indian twist with a brief dip in hot sugar syrup at the very end,” says Subramani.

Around 250 kilos of Chandrarkala are made per day during lockdown.

Assembly line

Their name derives from their shape — Chandrakala looks like a crescent moon, while the Suryakala is round, like the sun. Due to the lockdown, Suryakala is made only during the weekends, while three varieties of Chandrakala – regular, ghee and almond filling — are churned out from Monday to Friday.

Where possible, machines like paddle mixers and dough extruders help to streamline the production process in Bombay Sweets. For the Chandrakala preparation, a heavy-duty mixer kneads maida and water into a silky dough that is then passed through a mechanical cutter which forms equal sized portions for rolling out.

Workers then sit in assembly-line fashion to break down the task of rolling out, filling, and then delicately folding the edges of the pastry discs by hand.

Another team of cooks supervising huge oil-filled pans is on hand to fry the Chandrakala. The flame is kept on medium heat, to ensure that both the casing and filling are well-cooked. The parcels are turned constantly with slotted spoons in the hot oil, and once drained, the fried pastry is passed on to the next team overseeing the sugar syrup.

The Chandrakala pockets are removed as soon as the fluted edges look glazed. “If this step gets delayed, you can end up with soggy Chandrakala, so the cooks have to be very careful,” says Subramani Sharma.

We get to sample a Chandrakala fresh from the kitchen. The crisp pastry and soft filling get a low sugar kick from the syrup, making it an ideal teatime snack.

Going online

With footfalls at restaurants reducing due to the lockdown, Bombay Sweets has started offering pre-packaged snack combinations for both online and offline sales. “As the festive season is set to begin, and due to the improvement in delivery logistics, we have decided to reach out to Indian customers through our website. We also get many orders from Thanjavur residents living abroad,” says Subramani Sharma.

The demand for Chandrakala and Suryakala has grown with the new mini versions that are ideal for gifting.

Subramani Sharma has catalogued all the recipes that are being used by Bombay Sweets, and hopes the family’s forthcoming generations will develop the patriarch Guru Dayal Sharma’s vision further.

“Even at the age of 52, I miss my father, who passed away in 1991. His career in Thanjavur alone lasted 50 years. Though the branches have grown since his demise, at the end of the day, Bombay Sweets is the tree that he planted. And Chandrakala and Suryakala are fine examples of his creativity,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/2cx62c/article32742815.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chandrakala-ready-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/thanjavurs-bombay-sweets-comes-up-with-south-indian-twist-on-the-gujiya/article32742819.ece
428,2020/10/01,So many flavours of ilish,"The waters of Bengal are not the hilsa’s only abode. We explore how connoisseurs in Telangana and Assam have their own, traditional take on this fish, which has a loyal following

Hilsa or ilish is an expensive seasonal fish. When it is in season (September to October), hilsa lovers tend to loosen their purse strings at least once. Starting at ₹1,200 a kilogram, the variety, depending on where it is sourced from, can go up to ₹3,000 to ₹4,000. The price, however, is not a concern for those who love this fish: to them, after all, it is a yearly, special occassion splurge.

Full of bones and with a distinctive sweetish flavour, the fish is tricky to eat, which contributes to its allure. In Telugu land, hilsa is called pulasa and served in a delicious pulusu (tangy curry). Pulasa from the Godavari belt in Andhra Pradesh is relished by Telugu fish lovers. The very mention of the fish on the menu, can draw diners, lining up to savour a piece or two.

Hyderabad-based restaurateur Kuchipudi Venkat says, given the opportunity, he drives from Telangana to Dowleswaram barrage at Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh for the best catch.

“This is the oldest barrage and the catchment area for pulasa. The price is decided through an auction; it usually starts at ₹1,000 and can go up to ₹4,000. The fish from this area is the sweetest. The next thing to do is simmer it in tangy pulusu made of tamarind paste,” he says.

Sampath Srinivas Tummala, who owns Spicy Venue in Hyderabad and Vizag, quotes a popular saying in Telugu: “Pustelu ammukunaina, pulasa tinnali (One just has to eat pulasa even if it is at the cost of selling the mangalsutra). The fish is slow-cooked for several hours so that the bone melts in your mouth; nothing is wasted.”

Discussing hilsa without mentioning hilsa with sorshe bata (mustard paste) or bhappa hilsa is akin to a food crime.

With many people spending more time at home this year, because of COVID19, traditional dishes are making a comeback.

Kolkata-based recipe developer Sayantani Mahapatra Mudi says, “Since our roots lie in coastal Bengal — Midnapore district, to be precise — we prepare a lot of dishes with a souring agent. So every time baba (father) bought ilish, it had to be cooked two ways. Sorshe ilish and ilish macher tawk with aged tamarind paste, pumpkin and ladies finger. Unlike other homes where only the head or tail of the fish is cooked that way, ours was cooked with the best gada (back) and peti (stomach) pieces. It’s a slow-cooked dish full of aroma.”

She adds, “Maa also made Medinipuri amda ilish, another sour curry, made with hog plums that are seasonal with the ilish. I loved maa’s doi ilish (ilish with curd), that smooth velvety gravy was her speciality. And the head always ended up in kochur saag (taro stems) with some black chickpeas and fresh coconut.”

Sayantani also recollects Ilish Hara Gouri, where the whole fish is cooked, one side in a tamarind gravy and the other side in mustard gravy; so it has two different tastes. “Later, maa learnt to make a spicy and sour curry from my aunt whose roots are in Bangladesh. That curry used hog plum, cumin and mustard,” she says.

For the Assamese, ilish season is one of celebration; but for a change, this is one fish that is not put in the masor tenga jul (fish sour curry). Incorporating mustard paste is common practice in the region, but some homes love to make ilish curry with raw banana and generous amounts of freshly pounded pepper.

Guwahati-based food blogger Sanjukta Dutta says, “We call the raw banana ilish curry kaskolor jul. Also, the roe of the ilish is a delicacy and is best eaten fried with a little salt.”

Bringing something completely different to the table is Chandrima Sarkar. Active on social media as Notoutofthebox, Chandrima loves traditional ilish dishes, especially the leaf -wrapped preparations from her childhood.

Although she takes great pride in her ilish pulao, Chandrima says, “While marinated and steamed ilish in banana leaf is well-known, at home, marinated ilish was wrapped in pumpkin and colocasia leaves as well. The steamed leaves were to be eaten with the rice; a flavour to savour.”

Chandrima is not alone in giving the ilish dish a twist. Sayantani says, “Once I started cooking and experimenting, people loved daab ilish (hilsa cooked inside a tender coconut with the coconut flesh).”

Irrespective of these variations, one factor remains constant: “The oil in which ilish is fried is special. Most people love rice mixed with this oil, with a green chilli to go on the side,” says Kolkata-based Debjani Ghatak.

Pro tip

Sayantani’s suggestions: “A good ilish for me is the one with roe in it. The taste is somehow not as good without roe. So I always check the belly. If it is bulged and soft, I buy it. “

Size matters when buying hilsa. The bigger, the better, she adds. “The natural oils of hilsa fish need to mature for some time after it is cooked; it tastes even better when it is a day old.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/c7x5dq/article32741708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chandrima-Sarkars-Ilish-Pulao,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/savouring-the-beloved-ilish-or-hilsa/article32741710.ece

Shiraz

“To tell you the truth, I am a little shattered,” confesses Nasrin Karimi over phone from her newest avatar of Shiraz. The elegant restaurant, popular for its delicate Persian food, laced with dried mint, rosewater and saffron, launched at the Cholamandal Artists’ Village in 2010, and moved locations twice after that.

Early this year, Shiraz moved again, this time to a beachside café in Neelankarai, and Nasrin was just settling into her new space when COVID-19 struck. She quickly pivoted into delivery, creating a flexible new menu featuring classics, like berry pulao, chelo kebabs and ghormeh sabzi (a comforting stew bursting with the freshness of cilantro and celery).

She also began baking cakes for lockdown birthdays: her Shiraz cake, woven with saffron, pistachios and almond, and the ‘Persian love cake,’ a fluffy sponge slathered with fresh cream, pistachios and rose water.

However, realising that a keeping a large restaurant runninng is impractical now, given current physical distancing norms, she has relocated again, this time to a small space in Akkarai.

“This Shiraz will be more affordable. And I will focus on sea food — locally caught crabs, prawn and fish,” she explains. The menu will also feature easy takeaway food: a range of sandwiches (tuna, chicken, cheese), sausage rolls, tall glasses of guava-barley slush and steamy cups of saffron tea. Ideal for picnics on ECR, now that people are slowly venturing out again on weekends.

Honestly, after six months on the couch, a sandwich in the car sounds like a delightful adventure!

Café Ceylon

Not surprisingly, the hot butter cuttlefish sells out. Tossed in butter along with garlic, chilli paste, capsicum and spring onion, it is a pleasing balance of sweetness and spice.

When Sri Lankan sisters Mayuri Naguleswaran and Prashanthini Ragunath decided to start Café Ceylon in Besant Nagar, where they both live, they curated all their favourite recipes, and then whittled them down into a realistic, short menu suitable for a home kitchen.

“We are very new to this,” says Mayuri, adding, “But we do Sri Lankan cooking at home, and have noticed that a lot of people like it. We also noticed that it is quite hard to find regular Sri Lankan food in Chennai. So, a few weeks ago, we decided to start taking orders.”

The sisters were surprised at the immediate, and enthusiastic, response. “I thought we would grow slowly — we only cook on Friday, Saturday and Sunday,” says Mayuri, adding however, that they are busy through the weekend.

Of course, since this is a home kitchen, following fairly laborious traditional techniques, the numbers they can cater to are limited. “We make our own coconut milk — you don’t get the authentic taste with store bought powders. We also make sambol, hand pounding it with chillies and onions everyday,” says Mayuri.

The menu includes spicy maalu (fish) cutlets, devilled prawns, crab curry and vambatu moju (spiced brinjal). For dessert, try the sweet lavaria, string hoppers rolled with jaggery and bursting with shredded coconut.

Rusiya

Vishalla Vairavan’s garden is fragrant with pandan leaves. “Only now I know their worth,” she laughs, between planning how to use them in her menu this weekend. After years of cooking for appreciative friends and family, Vishalla recently launched Rusiya, specialising in Malaysian dishes.

“I travel to Kuala Lampur at least once a year, and I have a friend who caters for weddings there. I learnt from her,” she says. Vishalla adds, however, that she has tweaked her recipes for Chennai. “There is no such thing as ‘vegetarian’ in Malaysia — even spring rolls have prawn paste in them!” she says, explaining how she finds inventive ways to create vegetarian options on every menu.

Her mee goreng, for example, replaces shrimp with tofu, capsicum and bok choy. Lacy roti jala is served with eggplant sambol for the vegetarians, while the rest get the traditional version with prawn.

Since Vishalla is operating from her home kitchen, she posts her menu on Instagram and Facebook on Thursdays, and closes orders once she hits about 80 (each portion serves two). The food is cooked and delivered on Sunday.

She is trying to keep the packaging as eco-friendly and traditional as possible. “I used to wrap my nasi lemak in leaves and newspaper, now I use butter paper and palm leaf baskets,” she says.

Hailing from Karaikudi, she is also the author of 100 Chettinad recipes, and enjoys experimenting with a variety of cuisines, so her weekend menus are flexible.

Keep an eye out for the sweet treats. “I make kuih dadar, which are coconut milk pancakes flavoured with pandan leaves and filled with coconut and palm sugar. Also onde onde: rice balls stuffed with palm sugar, and corn custard,” she says.

For those of us craving a quick vacation, she makes buttery tarts, reminiscent of a day at the beach, topped with sticky homemade pineapple jam.

430,2020/10/01,"‘Judges today don’t work for people, they only work for the govt.’","1993 Mumbai riots survivor says judiciary has become silent spectator

Farooq Mapkar, a survivor of the 1993 riots in Mumbai, on Thursday said the special CBI court’s judgment acquitting all 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case shows that the “judges today don’t work for people, they only work for the government”.

He was speaking at a virtual conference titled ‘Babri Demolition Judgment – Yet Another Nail in Democracy’s Coffin’. Mr. Mapkar said, “The judiciary has just become silent spectators to what is happening around. The judges have the time to listen to [actor] Kangana Ranaut because her house was demolished, but what about us [Muslims]. We are never heard. The BJP is in [power] at the Centre and the State, that is why cases like the Hathras [gangrape] take place. We need to stand up to this and fight.”

Referring to the Liberhan Commission, human rights activist Teesta Setalvad said, “The report has nailed the criminals leading the entire movement, which started in 1986 and led to the demonising of Muslims and gender-targeted violence.”

Headed by Justice M.S. Liberhan, the commission was set up on December 16, 1992, to probe the sequence of events that led to the Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992. The commission submitted its report 16 years later to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on June 30, 2009.

Ms. Setalvad said Wednesday’s verdict is a “travesty of justice and goes to show that the judiciary cannot withstand the political might when it comes to the Ram Janambhoomi”.

Senior advocate Mihir Desai said those acquitted in the case are cowards and the judgment is “unfortunate but not unexpected”.

He said in 2011, when the charge of conspiracy was dropped against the accused and the Supreme Court said they must be charged with conspiracy. However, the judgment says there was no conspiracy.

Mr. Desai said, “People were there on the site despite [the imposition of] Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which makes the assembly of more than five people unlawful, so they should have been at least convicted under that. Even if the judgment is written on a philosophy, you [judges] have to at least rely on the evidence.”

Senior journalist Meena Menon said despite several incendiary speeches and videos being recorded in the run up to the demolition, the court noted that there was no evidence to prove the hatching of a conspiracy. “Justice won’t come out in this government and people are now looking to providence for justice,” she said.

Lawyer and activist Flavia Agnes said that there was no pressure to expedite the criminal trial, which went on for 28 years. “The right wing leaders boasted about what happened [the demolition] and the court said all the evidence was doctored. What is the rule of law then. What is the fear of the judiciary?” she said,

Lawyer and activist Shakil Ahmed said the judgment is not surprising as the BJP is in power both in the Centre and in the State. He said, “Everything has been done in an unconstitutional way.”

431,2020/10/01,Maharashtra CM directs withdrawal of cases against Aarey activists,"The activists had protested against the felling of trees for a proposed metro car shed in Aarey Colony.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday directed the State Home department to withdraw cases registered against protesters last year for opposing felling of trees for a proposed metro car shed in Aarey Colony, a prime green lung of the city.

The decision was taken at the State cabinet meeting.

A tweet from the Chief Minister’s office said Mr. Thackeray has directed the State home department to begin the process of withdrawing the cases.

The request for withdrawal of cases was made at the cabinet meeting by State Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray, which was supported by Deputy CM Ajit Pawar and other ministers.

“I thank all the cabinet colleagues of the MVA government for prioritising and realising the importance of sustainable development and green governance and supporting such issues,” Aaditya Thackeray tweeted.

He said the protesters were citizens standing up for future of the planet.

“To hold them from stopping desired work was one thing but to press police charges was another. We can’t have cases against those who stand up for environment and forests,” he said in another tweet.

Uddhav Thackeray had announced withdrawal of cases against green activists last December, days after he took oath as Chief Minister.

Cases were registered after clashes broke out between the police and green activists opposing axing of trees by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) in Aarey Colony last October for construction of a metro car shed for the Metro-3 line.

Police had booked at least 38 protesters under IPC sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from duty) and 143 (unlawful assembly).

Last month, the CM had asked the Mumbai Metro and MMRDA (Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority) officials to examine whether the proposed metro car shed can be shifted to Pahadi Goregaon area near Oshiwara.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cofeqi/article29606045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05TH-LT-AAREY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-directs-withdrawal-of-cases-against-aarey-activists/article32739722.ece

434,2020/10/01,Answering your vehicle-related queries,"Which diesel automatic should I buy?

Bijender Singh, Hisar: I am planning to buy a diesel-automatic car but I am confused between three models — the Mahindra XUV300 AMT, Tata Nexon AMT and Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza AMT. Which of these is a value-for-money package with good mileage?

The Vitara Brezza is no longer being sold with a diesel engine so you are left with the XUV300 and the Nexon diesel AMTs. The XUV300 offers a more spacious cabin, better quality interiors and a far superior diesel engine — the XUV300’s 1.5 diesel is one of the best around. The Nexon has a bigger boot, better ride and handling and is cheaper. Assuming that you are buying the car for convenience, the XUV300 is easier to drive and overall the better choice.

Is this a fair price?

Mirza Kamran Baig: I want to buy a used car and saw a Hyundai i20 Sportz made in June 2011 that has covered 40,019km. It is a first owner car and looks to be in good condition. The seller is quoting ₹2.40 lakh. Should I negotiate for ₹2 lakh?

You could offer ₹2 lakh and leave the ball in the dealer’s court. If he wants to make the deal, he will surely reduce the price. The beauty of the used car market is that the more you search, the better your chances of getting a great deal.

The committee members expressed satisfaction over the pace at which the civil works were progressing as per schedule. There were no fund constraints and workers had been advised to follow safety norms, she added.

The Chief Minister laid the foundation for the college in the presence of Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan a few months ago after the Centre gave its approval for establishing 11 medical colleges in Tamil Nadu.

The government earmarked ₹345 crore for the project, which was coming up near the Collectorate complex.

In all probability, the government might start admitting students in the medical college next year, a district official said.

437,2020/10/01,Vegetable prices soar in Tiruchi,"Due to issues in storing the produce at temporary markets, traders were buying less

A sharp rise in prices of vegetables has caused concern among consumers in Tiruchi.

The Tiruchi market usually sees heavy arrival of vegetables mainly from hill areas and the districts situated along the Western Ghats in the State including Dindigul, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode and Ooty. Since, people in general avoid conducting marriages in the Tamil month of Puratasi, the sale of vegetables is too limited only to household buyers and hoteliers. Since educational institutions have been closed for more than six months, there are no bulk purchase of vegetables for hostels too.

However, prices of most vegetables, except for tomatoes, have gone up in the market. A kilo of shallots was being sold at ₹80 in the retail grocery stores on Thursday, while it was being sold at ₹60 -70 a kg in the temporary vegetable markets and the Uzhavar Sandhai at Anna Nagar. Carrot and beans were quoted at ₹70 and ₹60 a kg, respectively. Ladies fingers, beetroot, big onion and ‘nookal’ were being sold at ₹40 a kg. A bunch of coriander leaves was selling at ₹25.

“Vegetable prices are abnormally high in the wholesale market in Tiruchi during the current month. We sell small onions at ₹80 a kg with a margin of ₹10 a kg. Customers, who are well versed with the price dynamics of vegetables in different seasons question us for high cost of vegetables,” says Manikandan, a grocery trader in Cantonment.

Enquiries with the Gandhi market traders, who operate from G. Corner and temporary markets after the closure of Gandhi market in view of the spread of COVID-19, revealed that the high rates were limited only to markets in Tiruchi. There was no problem on the supply side as yield of vegetables was near normal in production centres. But, traders in Tiruchi preferred to receive just half of the usual volume. Logistic issues in storing vegetables at the temporary markets was said to have prevented traders to receive the actual load from the supply side.

“We do not have space to store vegetables at the temporary markets. Many traders suffered huge loss as the unsold stock kept in open places got drenched in the recent rain and subsequently rotten. Hence, the traders have restricted the arrival, thereby causing spurt in prices of vegetables in the current month,” says M. K. Kamalakannan, a trader in Tiruchi.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/lzv9gp/article32744691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY02VEGESTTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/vegetable-prices-soar-in-tiruchi/article32744692.ece

440,2020/10/01,Uyyakondan riverfront development project on way to completion,"The project, undertaken under the Smart Cities Mission, is being constructed at an estimated cost of ₹17.56 crore.

The Uyyakondan riverfront development project is halfway through and will open for the public by next summer, officials at the Tiruchi City Corporation said. With nearly 50% of the work being completed, the remaining work has gathered steam and will soon be finished, they said.

The project, undertaken under the Smart Cities Mission, is being constructed at an estimated cost of ₹17.56 crore. The primary feature of the project is the construction of three public parks on the left bank of the irrigation channel metres away from the MGR statue for a length of 2.6 km, which includes a walkway, a park with fountains and an open-air amphitheatre where art and cultural shows can be held.

Work on construction of retaining wall and fencing along the canal has been completed and a retaining wall, along the side of the road too, has been constructed. Bio-fencing has been created for 2,600 metres along the canal in order to prevent people from littering while the retaining wall will extend through the length of the three parks at 585 metres.

“The work slowed down during the lockdown but now it has picked up pace and will be completed soon, S. Sivasubramanian, City Corporation Commissioner said. “Work on the amphitheatre and the fountain is under way and will be completed first followed by the remaining landscaping,” he said. The amphitheatre, the first of its kind in the city, can accommodate about 200 persons.

441,2020/10/01,Faulty equipment charge: Defence civilian employee unions seek CBI probe,"Referring to media reports stating that faulty equipment supplied by ordnance factories has caused deaths of a sizeable number of Indian Army personnel, unions of defence civilian employees have approached the President of India seeking a CBI probe into leakage of information in violation of Official Secrets Act 1923 and Army Rules 1954.

In a petition addressed to the President and the Union Defence Minister, the All India Defence Employees’ Federation, Indian National Defence Workers’ Federation and Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh have expressed anguish over what they described as the ‘systematic campaign unleashed by vested interests on ordnance factories and its employees to deliberately tarnish their image after the Central Government's decision to corporatise the defence production units’.

“We are afraid that this will affect national security and also the faith and the reliability of Indian Armed Forces on the arms and ammunitions manufactured and supplied by the Indian Ordnance Factories,” C. Srikumar, general secretary, AIDEF, said.

Ordnance factories have been producing arms and ammunitions for more than 200 years. Never did such type of complaint arise. The arms and ammunitions are inspected and certified by representatives of the Army at all stages of production, he said.

“All types of ammunitions have got shelf life. The inquiry must be done to know whether these ammunitions had crossed their shelf life and if accountability had been fixed on erring officials of Ordnance Factory Board, Directorate General of Quality Assurance and Army,” the petition said.

On its part, the OFB has termed the media reports on faulty equipment as ‘alarmist and defamatory’.

In a press release, Gagan Chaturvedi, Deputy Director General - Corporate Communication Division, OFB, said that out of the total number of accidents where defect investigation has been completed, only 2% of the cases where casualties had been reported were attributable to the OFB.

After 2005-06, when the responsibility for inspection of input material was given to OFB, there has been a decrease in the number of accidents. Since 2013, a system of advanced early user exploitation, based on a random sample drawn from each freshly manufactured lot of ammunition was in place, in addition to the established schedule of inspection and validation conducted by the DGQA. The results of this system have demonstrated a satisfaction level of more than 99% which was comparable to international standards. The quality of ammunition manufactured by the OFB was also amply testified to by the receipt of repeat export orders of ammunition supplied under self-certification, the press release said.

442,2020/10/01,Unlock Phase-V: Karaikal Chamber of Commerce seeks relaxation in timing,"The Karaikal Chamber of Commerce has approached the Puducherry government seeking a few relaxations for the business community under Unlock Phase-V.

In a representation to Puducherry Chief Minister, president of Karaikal Chamber of Commerce A. Muthaiya sought consent for opening of shops and establishments till 9 pm.

Only by opening of cinema halls, hotels, guest houses and bars can the economy be revived and revenue generated for the government, Mr. Muthaiah said in the letter.

With the festival season ahead, the relaxations were necessary in the interests of the general public as well, he said.

Businesses in Karaikal town depend on the people living in a radius of 15 to 20 km for sustenance. Since Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai towns are distant, the residents depend on shopping establishments in Karaikal to make their festival purchases.

Operation of bus services has enabled them to visit Karaikal town without difficulty. “At present, business in textile shops in particular has risen to the extent of 75% than usual. The extension of timing will take up the business transactions close to 90 %,” the letter said.

Acknowledging that spurt in COVID positive cases over the last week was a cause for concern, Mr. Muthaiah sought to assure that the business establishments were quite serious about following the Standard Operating Procedures for safety.

While stipulations for wearing of masks and sanitising hands were being followed with care, social distancing continues to be a grey area, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/unlock-phase-v-karaikal-chamber-of-commerce-seeks-relaxation-in-timing/article32743195.ece

Papu Gomez scored twice as Atalanta overpowered Lazio 4-1 in Rome while Serie A title rival Inter Milan crushed promoted Benevento 5-2 on Wednesday.

The two scheduled season-opening matches had been pushed back because of Atalanta and Inter’s European campaigns in August.

Atalanta and Inter are now both top of the Serie A table alongside Napoli, Hellas Verona and AC Milan with a maximum of six points from two games.

Real Madrid missed the creativity of the injured Eden Hazard as only a fortuitous goal from substitute Vinicius Junior earned it a 1-0 victory over Real Valladolid in LaLiga on Wednesday.

446,2020/10/01,Spanish League | Real Madrid beats Valladolid 1-0; Atlético draws with Huesca,"Vinícius Júnior broke the deadlock for Real Madrid from close range after a defensive mistake by Valladolid defenders inside the area.

Vinícius Júnior scored after coming off the bench as Real Madrid defeated Valladolid 1-0 on Wednesday for its second win in a row in the Spanish league, while Atlético Madrid was held to a scoreless draw against promoted Huesca in a disappointing first start for Luis Suŕrez.

Vinícius Júnior netted the winner midway through the second half after Madrid’s forwards struggled again in attack. The young Brazilian broke the deadlock from close range after a defensive mistake by Valladolid defenders inside the area.

Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane started the match with two strikers, but Karim Benzema also was far from his best up front.

""It was difficult in the first half, but we changed the game after we switched the scheme (to a 4-3-3) and I entered the match with (Marco) Asensio,” Vinícius Júnior said.

Vinícius Júnior became the first forward to score for Madrid this season after it opened its title-defense campaign with a 0-0 draw at Real Sociedad and a 3-2 win against Real Betis thanks to a late penalty kick converted by defender Sergio Ramos.

Madrid again was without Eden Hazard, who had recovered from an ankle injury but now is nursing a right leg muscle injury.

The victory left Madrid at the top of the standings with seven points, along with Getafe, Valencia and Villarreal. Madrid and Getafe have a game in hand.

Valladolid, winless after four matches, had a few good chances on counterattacks and forced Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to make a couple of good saves.

Barcelona visits unbeaten Celta Vigo on Thursday.

Barcelona and Atlético had their first two matches postponed because of the participation in the quarterfinals of the Champions League in August. Madrid had one game postponed after reaching the round of 16.

Atlético draws match

Suarez followed up his promising debut for Atlético with a lackluster performance in his first start on Wednesday.

Three days after scoring two goals and setting up another in about 20 minutes off the bench in Atlético’s 6-1 win over Granada, Suarez struggled in the team’s 0-0 draw at Huesca.

The former Barcelona player started alongside young Portugal forward João Félix, but the duo failed to spark the attack for Diego Simeone’s team.

The Uruguay striker had the game’s best chance after a perfect through-ball by Félix in the 59th minute, but he failed to get past goalkeeper Andrés Fernández inside the area and eventually had his shot blocked.

Suarez was substituted by Diego Costa less than three minutes after the miss, but the Brazilian-born striker also couldn’t do much up front. Atlético pressured near the end but failed to capitalise on a couple of good opportunities from inside the area.

""What we did in the second half is the right path,” Simeone said. “We just couldn’t capitalize on our chances.”

Villarreal wins

Villarreal rebounded from a 4-0 loss at Barcelona with a 3-1 home win against Alavés.

Paco Alcácer opened the scoring in the 13th minute and sealed the victory in the 67th. Gerard Moreno converted a 45th-minute penalty kick after Alavés had equalized through Édgar Méndez in the 36th.

Pramila took Ms. Mariyakumari to a clinic on the pretext of administering vaccine to the baby and later to a studio near the Clock Tower to take a photograph for opening of the bank account.

“As Ms. Mariyakumari went inside the studio after handing over the baby to Pramila, the latter fled with the baby,” the SP said.

The mother lodged a police complaint and a search was launched for the baby. As the police started searching all the vehicles in Darsi and other places, the accused chose not to move out of the district. The police traced the accused and the baby to Uppalapadu. Pramila was arrested, the SP said.

449,2020/10/01,Vignan keen on students’ fitness,"University organises run on eve of Gandhi jayanti

With fitness and good health emerging key in the battle against COVID-19, educational institutions are making it mandatory for students to play, exercise or simply walk for at least an hour.

Vignan University has become the first deemed to be university to introduce credits to fitness. Vignan Group of Educational Institutions chairman Lavu Rathaiah, who introduced the one hour mandatory fitness programme over an year ago, said students should have basic fitness to keep them in good stead for the mental and physical rigours of life after college.

Students of various colleges were given the freedom to either play sports they liked or to walk around the ground for at least 45 minutes. Now, the university is planning to give credits based on fitness.

On Thursday, the university organised Fit India Plogging Run, on the eve of Mahatma Gandhi birth anniversary. The theme of the run is ‘Swast, Purity, Staying, Fit and Keeping the Country Clean’.

While urging the students to keep fit, university registrar M.S. Raghunathan said that students who keep fit would be given credits. He said that sports should become a part of curriculum along with other subjects. Each student would be asked to play their favourite game on the field for one hour daily, thereby improving physical health as well as mental fitness and added that playing as a group of students in games enhances leadership qualities.

On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, various cultural competitions like quizzes, painting, creative writing and lectures are being organised for the students online for four days.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/vignan-keen-on-students-fitness/article32747560.ece
450,2020/10/01,Rains worsen condition of roads in Guntur,"Delay in completion of UGD project compounds woes of pedestrians, motorists

The woes of the people in Guntur may continue at least for some more months. The recent spell of rain worsens the plight of pedestrians and commuters. The residential areas where the Underground Drainage (UGD) works were taken up four and a half years ago, still resemble a cesspool with patches of road in between. The municipal administration draws flak from the people for its ‘apathy’.

The situation has turned worse due to incessant rains for over a month. Even after a visit by the Secretary, Municipal Administration, J. Syamala Rao, there is no improvement in the situation.

The contractor, who has bagged the works for execution of the UGD project, a fully-funded project by the Central government, Shapoorji and Pallonji, has left and there is no clarity on who would be executing the project. While the local MLAs say that the State government has released ₹25 crore to relay roads, there is no clarity on when the works would actually begin. The UGD project, which was launched in January 2017, was itself in a limbo, four years after it was started.

With the condition of roads getting worse, the local public representatives got into the act. MLC K.S. Lakshmana Rao rued that his car needed major repairs after the wheels got struck and suspension damaged while returning home at Syamala Nagar. In Vidya Nagar and Vikas Nagar, residents came together to pool up money to carry out repairs.

Road network

The city has a road network of over 1,800 km, and there are some roads maintained by the Roads and Buildings Department. Some of the major roads maintained by the R&B Department are Ponnur Road, Nandivelugu Road, Amaravathi Road, while GMC maintains most of the roads.

The condition of roads is always a cause for concern in the past but what has compounded the problem is the delay in grounding of the Underground Drainage Sewerage scheme. Granted as a one-time financial assistance scheme from the Union Ministry of Urban Development, with a cost of ₹903.82 crore, the UGD scheme is one of the biggest-ever grants to any urban local body in the State. By March 2015, the Centre fulfilled its commitment of allocating ₹540 crore.

The then TDP government finally zeroed in Shapoorji and Pallonji Construction firm, which had already been involved in the construction of Government Interim Complex at Velagapudi. The company has been given the contract in the EPC mode in September 2016 with a timeline to complete the project within 36 months.

Five zone

The works began in January 2017. The city was divided into five zones and it was estimated that pipelines extending to 1,083 km would be required to be laid covering 1,40,000 households. The Public Health Department, which was entrusted with the task of monitoring the project, failed to monitor the project prompting the intervention of the then Collector and Special Officer.

With the deadline ending in August , the UGD works in Guntur still remain in limbo. With just 50% of work getting completed in main components like pipeline, manholes, inspection chambers and road restoration, the project looks far from complete.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/s4z061/article32747538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02GTROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/rains-worsen-condition-of-roads-in-guntur/article32747539.ece
451,2020/10/01,"Woman dupes many with fake job offers in Gulf countries, held","Victims allege they were detained and sexually harassed

Police on Tuesday arrested one Akumarthi Jyothi (Madiki Jyothi), who allegedly cheated several women and girls on the pretext of sending them to Arab countries.

The ‘fake agent’ promised the women to send them to Dubai and other places and collected huge amount from them.

She allegedly cheated women in Palakol, Narsapuram, Mogalturu, Malkipuram, Razole, Tanuku and other places, said Narsapuram Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) K. Nageswara Rao.

Following a complaint made by some women to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy through various social media groups, police swung into action and arrested an agent G. Venkata Subba Rao, in August last.

The victims complained that they were detained and subjected to sexual harassment and the agent had deceived them. Based on a complaint, the Mogalturu police registered a case against Jyothi and issued a lookout notice.

More arrests likely

“On a tip-off from the immigration authorities that the agent came to Bengaluru airport on Monday, police arrested Jyothi and brought her to Narsapuram. She was produced in court,” said West Godavari district Superintendent of Police K. Narayana Naik.

Narsapuram CI B. Krishna Kumar and SI Priya Kumar said the modus operandi of the accused was to search for the jobless women and girls, promise them to send abroad, collect some amount and hand over them to the mediators, the SP said.

Vijayawada Municipal Commissioner V. Prasanna Venkatesh and Vijayawada Central MLA Malladi Vishnu on Wednesday inspected Besant Road along with officials concerned in view of the transformation of the popular shopping zone. The works will begin on Thursday.

They interacted with local shop owners and hawkers and told them that the works would be completed in time without causing much trouble to them. However, they were asked to cooperate with the authorities.

Officials said that fabricated concrete moulds would be used to cover the ground instead of CC road and drainages would be constructed only during night time so that shoppers would not face inconvenience.

The entire stretch of Besant Road between Eluru Road and Bandar Road would be transformed into a pedestrian-friendly stretch and all the hawkers and other vendors would be provided sufficient space, officials said.

Mr. Vishnu asked hawkers not to leave their pushcarts on the road during the night so that works can be carried out without any hurdles.

Later, they also inspected Raghavaiah Park and enquired the staff about the ongoing civil works.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/j9kfii/article32738338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01VJBESANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/work-on-transformation-of-besant-road-to-begin-today/article32738339.ece

457,2020/10/01,What about us?: A reading list for woke Indian children,"With recent titles and characters presented in non-stereotypical ways, The Hindu Weekend reading list is for our children who are growing up to be active and engaged citizens

In July this year, the CBSE announced a 30% reduction in syllabus across subjects for students in classes 9-12, due to the disruption caused by COVID-19. Portions on citizenship, secularism, democracy, diversity, gender, caste and wildlife will not be taught to students in the academic year 2020-21.

If such erasure continues in the years to come, where can youngsters turn to to find out more about the people, events and social movements that have shaped the narrative of their own country? Fortunately, here are some picture books, historical fiction and non-fiction titles that have recorded these stories with imagination!

Understanding the past

Women are often written out of history. Dr Devika Rangachari’s recent Queen of Earth is the story of the ninth-century Odisha queen, Prithvimahadevi. Intelligent and feisty, she is married to an enemy king as part of a power-brokering deal. But rather than wilt, she comes very much into her own and takes charge of the rapidly evolving political situation.

In Supriya Kelkar’s Ahimsa, 10-year-old Anjali’s life goes through big and small setbacks when her mother heeds Gandhiji’s call to join the freedom movement. From having to give up clothes made from imported material to being shunned by the community for teaching Dalit children. Anjali overcomes her own inner prejudices to step forward and do what needs to be done when her mother is imprisoned.

Bhimayana: Experiences of Untouchability written by S Anand and Srividya Natarajan and illustrated by Durgabai Vyam and Subhash Vyam takes readers through the inspiring life of Dr BR Ambedkar. The book documents several stories that young people will rarely get to read in textbooks, like the Mahad Satyagraha.

Paro Anand’s Being Gandhi takes us back to 1984. Chandrashekhar is a privileged teenager who is trying to find ways to shirk off a history project about trying to live by Gandhi’s philosophy. When riots break out post the assassination of the Prime Minister, he finds himself embodying the Mahatma’s ideologies, unwittingly at first and then with intent. The book reminds us that the Gandhian way is as relevant today as it was in the past, and always will be.

Understanding the present

At a time when pourakarmikas are bearing the brunt of the nation’s fight against Covid-19, understanding dignity of labour is crucial. Kancha Ilaiah and Durgabai Vyam’s Turning the Pot, Tilling the Land: Dignity of Labour in Our Times looks at the labour of adivasis, potters and weavers, and traces the immense contribution that they have made to society through the lens of caste, gender and religion. For the youngest of readers, Rajiv Eipe’s Anand is a gorgeously illustrated picture book about a sanitation worker who loves to look good and keep neighbourhoods looking good too.

I remember thinking that the Constitution had little to do with my life when I was in school. Young readers today will not arrive at such a foolish conclusion if they have read The Constitution of India for Children by Subhadra Sen Gupta and Tapas Guha. Written in a wonderfully conversational style, it introduces readers to the constitution and the key figures who helped frame it.

Older favourites It’s never too late to add some of these books to your library

Nina Sabnani’s ‘Mukand and Riaz’ is a picture book set against the backdrop of Partition. Vibrant applique work and block-printed textiles have been used to illustrate a timeless story about friendship and loss

‘Bhimrao Ambedkar: The Boy who Asked Why’ by Sowmya Rajendran and Satwik Ghade is just the picture book for introducing young readers to Dr Ambedkar

Siddhartha Sarma’s ‘Year of the Weeds’ is an introduction to the harsh realities of life in modern India: corporate greed, government indifference, and a complete disregard for the environment

With the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 being hotly debated, I Will Save My Land by Rinchin and Sagar Kolwankar beautifully depicts a girl’s anxiety about losing her land to hungry machines and tackles the issue of ‘development’ at a cost.

Every Indian girl in this country owes their education to the efforts of Savitribai Phule. In Sangeeta Mulay’s book Savitribai Phule and I, we come to learn more about this education reformist. Two stories run in parallel: Shabri, a young Dalit girl in college in the present day and Savitribai Phule’s life told through fictional diary entries. Both of them face humiliation and hatred for daring to seek an education.

Betiyaan Bhi Chaahain Azaadi by Kamla Bhasin and Shrujana Shridhar is a call to action and azadi for youngsters. Azadi from violence and harassment. Azadi to be who they want to be. Azadi to exercise their rights.The illustrations bring to mind the powerful images of the young women at the fore of the anti CAA-NRC protests from earlier in the year.

Being prepared for the future

With the climate crisis looming large, I want to end with Bijal Vachharajani and Radha Rangarajan’s 10 Indian Champions Who Are Fighting to Save the Planet.

460,2020/10/01,The Rapunzel regime: Rice water and onion juice are the new DIY remedies for hair care,"‘Victims’ of hair loss are trying the two ingredients that social media is pushing — onion juice and rice water. Do they work?

If YouTube influencers are to be believed (they’re often not), everything from pressing down on certain acupressure points, rubbing nails together, applying a methi (fenugreek) seed pack, and doing a shirsasan, can all result in healthy hair. Joining this list are two ingredients that have become popular — onion juice and rice water. Worry not, there are videos ranging from two to 20 minutes with why and how-to explainers. Even Bipasha Basu posted on social media about these kitchen staples as a remedy for hairfall.

Despite no research done on this, these social media ‘experts’ say these remedies work, However, Mumbai-based dermatologist Dr Aparna Santhanam says it’s best to consult a doctor if hair loss persists for over three weeks. “Telogen Effluvium (temporary hair loss caused due to stress, trauma, and medication) takes place for a period. Beyond this, the condition signifies major nutritional imbalances, which need to be corrected.” Your doctor may investigate for viral infections, anaemia, and nutritional deficiencies. If your hairfall has just started though, you could try these.

Onion juice tears

A good massage on the scalp with onion juice is known to improve blood circulation. Also, the sulphur and antioxidants present in onions support hair growth and help in preventing hair fall, explains Dr Santhanam.

Onion juice, extracted either by grating or running in a blender, can be applied daily, suggests Moscow-based Ayurveda practitioner Dr Vivek Joshi. Apply it at the problem area on the scalp, like a bald patch or a receding hairline. Applying the juice to the entire scalp is not necessary, he says.

If you find juice extraction cumbersome, rub the scalp with a half-cut onion, says Dr Joshi. He explains that according to Ayurveda, onions have antimicrobial and anti-infectious properties, and are hence believed to prevent any kind of hair damage caused by microbes. You can stop the application when you’re satisfied with the improvement. If a condition like a scalp infection is addressed and treated, regrowth of hair in alopecia-affected spots is possible.

The simpler (non-smelly) remedy is the rice water rinse. Dr Santhanam says rice water is rich in antioxidants, minerals, amino acids, vitamins B, D, E, which help in the rejuvenation of cells that help the growth of the hair.

Dr Joshi breaks down the method: leave one cup of uncooked rice — any kind of rice — soaked in six cups of water to ferment overnight. Rinse hair in this water and wash off after 20 minutes. Thrice a week is ideal, more than that can make the hair dry. Inositol in rice water — also known as Vit B8, helps in strengthening the follicles, and also protects hair from further damage, explains Dr Joshi. For an instant rinse, water strained from cooked rice can also be used, however, diluting this water is better, adds Dr Joshi.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/ljofft/article32741049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Fermented-rice-water-and-onionjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/the-rapunzel-regime-rice-water-and-onion-juice-are-the-new-diy-remedies-for-hair-care/article32741053.ece
461,2020/10/01,How to grow your savings with Bajaj Finance FD?,"For years, there has been a prevailing misconception that post-millennials, or ‘Gen Z’ as they are commonly referred to, prefer spending lavishly over saving for the future. A recent study conducted by Tata Capital described this phenomenon as the ‘Millennial Pivot’, where the spending patterns of millennials and post-millennials have changed dramatically, with both generations differing greatly when it comes to their financial and social behaviours.

Why are savings back in focus now?

Today, young adults in the country are forced to re-evaluate their lifestyle and spending habits, especially with the uncertainty surrounding the job market, along with the economic downturn. The study also showed that about 34 percent of the Gen Z spend around 15 percent of their salary on non-essentials, a significant dip in their spending habits, while 31 percent of millennials also spend around the same amount from their earnings. Furthermore, according to the First Insight survey, 40 percent of the millennials are now cutting back on spending to brace themselves for financial uncertainties, especially following this year’s events. Both the millennials and Gen Z, seen as India’s youth, now prioritize saving their corpus to meet uncertainties, as the Indian job market saw its worst period in over 15 years earlier this year.

In May, 41 percent of the workforce aged between 15-29 were let go, as per the data provided by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE). The month prior, it was reported by CMIE that around 27 million employees between the ages of 20 and 30 lost their jobs. This has resulted in most young adults searching for safer avenues like fixed deposit to park their money, and searching for options for capital appreciation that do not depend on the market movement. The preceding sentiment can be highlighted by the fact that among millennials, those who earn more than Rs. 75,000 per month are now trying to save more than 20 percent of their earnings, while 40 percent of the millennials and around 17 percent of Gen Z’ers have already started saving for their retirement.

What is the safest way to grow savings?

Among risk-averse investors, fixed deposit has traditionally been one of the most popular options. This is because FD not only offers higher safety, but also serves as ideal instrument for capital growth. Among the FDs offered by financial institutions today, Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit offers some of the highest FD interest rates in India , with up to 7.35 percent returns.

During these unprecedented times, it is also important to ensure that the money you park in FDs remains safe. Bajaj Finance FD is backed by ratings of FAAA (stable) by CRISIL, and MAAA (stable) by ICRA, which assure you of the highest safety and security of your investments. Bajaj Finance also offers flexible tenures ranging from 12 to 60 months, with a minimum lock-in period of only 3 months. Additionally, investing in Bajaj Finance online FD, you can avail an interest rate of 7.2 percent, while opening an account offline will fetch you an interest rate of 7.1 percent. For senior citizens, Bajaj Finance offers an interest rate of 7.35 percent (offline and online) for FD schemes.

For young investors

Young adults, particularly in the current market climate, need to think long-term, and have a long investment horizon. For instance, if you are earning around Rs. 50,000 per month, then you can focus on wealth creation through FDs by either putting in a lump-sum amount, or through Systematic Deposit Plan (SDPs). To invest in a Bajaj Finance fixed deposit scheme, you can start with a minimum amount of Rs. 25,000, or invest through SDPs, by putting in just Rs. 5,000 per month. Let us take a closer look at both the scenarios.

Considering the fact that you wouldn’t have amassed a significant amount in your early years (say, by the time you turn 32), by investing just Rs. 1,00,000 for a period of 5 years, here is how much you can expect your money to grow by the end of the fifth year.

If you choose to invest through the Systematic Deposit Plan (SDP), by investing Rs. 5,000, Rs. 10,000 or Rs. 15,000 per month for a period of 5 years (48 deposits), here is how much you can expect your savings to grow by the end of the fifth year.

Thus, if you earn Rs. 50,000 per month, by storing away 30 percent of your monthly income, and investing in a Bajaj Finance FD scheme through SDP for a tenure of five years, you can save more than Rs. 10 lakhs!
