0,2020/10/09,Meet the real power players: on alternate career paths for college students in 2020,"Career choices where you can call the shots with minimal effort

‘What a show off!’ I smirked, as I watched the US presidential debate, ‘Just because he’s in power!’ Of the current president or the ex-VP? Nah, of the man who wagged his finger at both. The moderator, Chris Wallace, treated the potential leaders of the country like tantrum-throwing kindergartners, doling out their two minutes, snipping them off mid-sentence, rapping their knuckles for interrupting.

People in power! You’ve met enough who’ve made you squirm. Often literally. If you’ve shared a bathroom with someone who reads a 600-page novel in there, or at times you suspect is writing one, you’ll know what I mean. You’ve twisted your legs together, held your breath and bladder, whined and wheedled, but it falls on deaf ears of he who squats on the throne within.

High on the list of mega manipulators is the doctor’s assistant. Not the one who holds a needle to your arm (he’s scary enough), but the one who sits outside, yawning, yakking on the phone, and sending everyone, but you, in. ‘But I got here before them,’ you will have pleaded at least thrice in an hour. ‘Sorry, earlier appointment,’ the assistant smiles at you or ‘Babies first’ or ‘Serious emergency’ while waving in an old man who’d fallen asleep, exhibiting neither baby nor emergency. The next time, you book the earliest appointment, haul in your cousin-in-law’s protesting baby and claim breathless agony. ‘Sorry, doctor had to leave,’ says this person in power, ‘personal engagement.’

What of the guy who checks your papers? For the driving licence, application, visa, loan, claim. You know he’s always going to reject you for something you’ve forgotten. And, of course, you can’t send it by mail; you need to bring it in person and spend another four hours in the queue to reach the counter just as the ‘Out for Lunch’ sign goes up.

Plumbers whom you’d pay an arm and a leg to because your toilet keeps regurgitating. Tailors who have no time to finish the sari blouse before the wedding. Auto drivers who refuse to go anywhere on the rainiest day of the week. Power players, all.

This power game starts early. When you’re a toddler, you’re tossed into it. The lower the class, the higher the power its teacher wields. ‘If you don’t, I will tell your mother,’ she frowns while your mother resorts to ‘If you don’t, I will tell your teacher.’ Either way, you’re toast, you realise young enough.

And so, since college admissions are around the corner, here’s a list of power-careers for your child who deserves the best: Man Friday. Gate-man. Paper-pusher. Eyebrow-plucker. And that unassailable power puff who answers the door to say, ‘Madam’s not at home’. ‘Please, please, just five minutes,’ you beg, ‘I just saw her, let me only...’ ‘Sorry, what is your name again?’ Power puff shrugs. ‘Yes, Madam said to tell you she’s pukka not at home.’

1,2020/10/09,Apple’s T2 chip in Mac has an unfixable security problem,"The flaw that can impact the MacOS platform, especially the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, is the one researchers have been using for over an year to jailbreak older models of the iPhone.

Security researchers have exposed a vulnerability in Apple’s T2 security chip that can allow hackers to jailbreak a Mac, and let them gain full control of the system. It will also help them get into an iPhone paired with it to steal records.

The flaw that can impact the MacOS platform, especially the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, is the one researchers have been using for over an year to jailbreak older models of the iPhone.

An attacker has to be physically present to access the device. But once they gain entry, they can install a remote system to access it virtually.

Checkra1n, a tech community providing high-quality tethered jailbreak, found that security of T2 chip can be compromised by running Checkm8 and Blackbird, jailbreak exploits for iOS devices.

Since both vulnerabilities were found in Read-Only-Memory part of the chip, which is flashed to the chip during production and cannot be altered later, Apple cannot patch them without rolling a completely new hardware.

The flaw is simply unfixable in any Mac equipped with the T2 security chip.

Once an attacker exploits the two vulnerabilities, they can gain full control over the system. They can access the entire processor, which can be used to install unauthorised software.

However, rebooting the T2 will likely get rid of this. Users can check Apple’s support page to get assistance on how to reboot the chip as simply rebooting the Mac does not help.

Rick Mark, a T2 specialist at T2Checkra1n, said his group had mailed Apple about the issue, but are yet to hear back from them. Mark has published a timeline blog about his findings on the vulnerability.

A Belgian security firm, IronPeak wrote in a blog that no recent macOS devices are any longer safe to use if left alone.

“The only thing they could do is recall affected product, but they don’t have items to replace them with,” Mark said. “Apple’s silence is going to reflect poorly.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/s7jiq1/article32814649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MacBook-Pro-2020jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/apples-t2-chip-in-mac-has-an-unfixable-security-problem/article32814638.ece

Intel has confirmed that its 11th generation Rocket Lake core desktop processors will arrive in the first quarter of 2021.

“It’ll be another fantastic processor for gaming, and we’re excited to disclose more details in the near future,” John Bonini, VP & GM at Intel said in a blog post.

Intel’s confirmation came on Wednesday, a day before AMD announced its next-gen Zen 3 CPUs for computer desktops.

While Intel officially did not announce any specifications about Rocket Lake, Videocardz, a technology news portal, reported that the processors will be compatible with existing 400-series motherboard. Meanwhile, the company is planning to launch a 500-series motherboard.

Intel Rocket Lake is considered to be a feature upgrade to Comet Lake.

According to hardware news portal Wccftech, Intel is expected to use the same 14nm process it has been using for years. The company is likely to offer new Xe graphics with integrated Thunderbolt 4.

Google is working on improving its new Chrome 86 version browser’s password security in both Android and iOS.

The search giant will inform users if their passwords saved to Chrome have been compromised to help them change or fix it.

In its new Chrome 86 update, Google is introducing safety checks on iOS and Android that will include checking for compromised passwords, telling if safe browsing is enabled, and whether the version of Chrome is updated with latest security protections.

To check for compromised passwords, Chrome will send a copy of usernames and passwords to Google using encrypted form. Google will check them against lists of credentials known to be compromised, following which it will notify if there has been a compromise.

Google is also planning to introduce ‘enhanced safe browsing’ for Android Chrome users to protect them from phishing, and other malware attacks.

“Among our users who have enabled checking websites and downloads in real time, our predictive phishing protections see a roughly 20% drop in users typing their passwords into phishing sites.” Google said in a statement.

To further strengthen security against phishing attacks, it launched Touch-to-fill for passwords.

For Chrome users on iOS, Google is adding a biometric authentication step before auto-filling passwords. Users will now be able to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID, or phone passcode.

Additionally, they will be able to use Chrome on iOS to autofill saved login details into other apps or browsers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/kpyonl/article32812179.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/google-securitypng,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-to-improve-chrome-browsers-password-security/article32812135.ece
5,2020/10/09,IBM to break up 109-year old company to focus on cloud growth,"IBM will list its IT infrastructure services unit, which provides technical support for 4,600 clients in 115 countries and has a backlog of $60 billion, as a separate company with a new name by the end of 2021.

International Business Machines Corp is splitting itself into two public companies, capping a years-long effort by the world's first big computing firm to diversify away from its legacy businesses to focus on high-margin cloud computing.

IBM will list its IT infrastructure services unit, which provides technical support for 4,600 clients in 115 countries and has a backlog of $60 billion, as a separate company with a new name by the end of 2021.

The new company will have 90,000 employees and its leadership structure will be decided in a few months, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters.

IBM, which currently has more than 352,000 workers, said it expects to record nearly $5 billion in expenses related to the separation and operational changes.

Investors cheered the surprise move by Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, the key architect behind IBM's $34 billion acquisition of cloud company Red Hat last year, sending the company's shares up 7%.

“We divested networking back in the '90s, we divested PCs back in the 2000s, we divested semiconductors about five years ago because all of them didn't necessarily play into the integrated value proposition,” Krishna said on a call with analysts.

BIG BLUE'S NEW FOCUS

In a blog, Krishna called the move a “significant shift” in the 109-year-old company's business model.

“IBM is essentially getting rid of a shrinking, low-margin operation given the cannibalizing impact of automation and cloud, masking stronger growth for the rest of the operation,” Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri said.

IBM, which has sought to make up for slowing software sales and seasonal demand for its mainframe servers, said it would now focus on open hybrid cloud and AI solutions that will account for more than half of its recurring revenues.

Krishna, who replaced Ginni Rometty as CEO in April, said IBM's software and solutions portfolio would account for the majority of company revenue after the separation.

The company also said it expects third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion and an adjusted profit per share of $2.58, roughly in line with Street estimates.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/mqkdgq/article32810923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IBMsplit,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ibm-to-break-up-109-year-old-company-to-focus-on-cloud-growth/article32810881.ece
6,2020/10/09,U.S. appeals judge's ruling that blocked U.S. ban on TikTok downloads,"Negotiations are under way for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

The U.S. government said in a court filing on Thursday it was appealing a judge's ruling that prevented it from prohibiting new downloads of the Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok.

The Justice Department said it appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

In late September, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that was set to bar Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google from offering new TikTok downloads.

China's ByteDance, which owns TikTok, has been under pressure to sell the popular app. The White House contends that TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China's government. Any deal will also still need to be reviewed by the U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

Negotiations are under way for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations.

But key terms of the deal - including who will have majority ownership - are in dispute. ByteDance has also said any deal will need to be approved by China.

7,2020/10/09,Waymo opens driverless robo-taxi service to the public in Phoenix,"Waymo chief John Krafcik said during a conference call that the company for now will offer only rides in driverless cars.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Waymo on Thursday will relaunch and expand its fully automated, robo-taxi ride hailing service in Phoenix, rebooting its effort to transform years of autonomous vehicle research into a revenue-producing business.

Waymo, the self-driving vehicle technology unit of Google parent Alphabet, Inc, said it will start offering rides in minivans with no human attendant on board to current members of its Waymo One service in Phoenix. Within a few weeks, Waymo plans to open access to anyone who downloads its smartphone app and wants a ride within a 50-square mile area of Phoenix.

Waymo chief John Krafcik said during a conference call that the company for now will offer only rides in driverless cars. Within a few weeks, Waymo will relaunch service for a larger, 100 square mile swath of the Phoenix area, using Pacifica minivans made by partner Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.

Some of the Waymo vans in Phoenix will still have attendants on board.

Waymo has not said where or when it will expand its robo-taxi business beyond Phoenix. “You can imagine wed love the opportunity to bring the Waymo One driver to our home state of California,” Krafcik said.

Before the coronavirus pandemic forced Waymo to suspend operations this spring, Waymo was using vehicles with no human attendant on board to provide five to ten percent out of a total of 1,000 to 2,000 rides per week in its Phoenix service zone, Krafcik said. Rides in fully autonomous vehicles were limited to a small, selected group of Waymo customers.

Waymo's move to expand service using vehicles with no attendant on board puts it ahead of rival robo-taxi companies in deploying a revenue generating service in the United States. Waymo earlier this year raised more than $3 billion, mostly from outside investors.

Cruise, majority controlled by General Motors Co, is testing vehicles in San Francisco, but has so far not offered rides to the public.

The pandemic has depressed demand for ride hailing services of all kinds. Waymo has stepped up attention to sanitation of its vehicles in response, Krafcik said. Waymo will monitor vans remotely, and employees will remind customers to keep masks on in the vehicles. Vehicles will be cleaned regularly under a maintenance and fleet management partnership with auto retailer AutoNation Inc, Krafcik said.

Fiat Chrysler has engineered a system that can flush the air from a minivan after every ride, he said.

The field of companies trying to develop self-driving vehicles has been consolidating as technology and regulatory challenges pushed the prospects of significant revenue from carrying passengers further into the future. Waymo and other autonomous vehicle technology companies have put increased focus on automating commercial vehicles for goods delivery.

Waymo rival Zoox was acquired earlier this year by Amazon.com Inc. Ride hailing company Uber Technologies Inc was set back by a fatal accident involving one of its test vehicles.

The U.S. Congress has failed to act on proposals to create standards and safety regulations the industry can rely on as a legal shield when deploying self-driving vehicles.

In Arizona, Waymo said it informs state officials ahead of any change in its service.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/uai7qj/article32810746.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Waymo-Chrysler-Pacifica-Hybrid-self-driving-vehicles,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/waymo-opens-driverless-robo-taxi-service-to-the-public-in-phoenix/article32810834.ece

10,2020/10/09,Microsoft's exploring holographic storage devices for its cloud. What does it mean?,"According to the US-based company, about 125 zettabytes of data will be generated annually by 2024, and storing this in a cost-effective way is going to be a big challenge.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Microsoft Azure's CTO Mark Russinovich announced at the company’s Ignite 2020 event that it is exploring feasibility of holographic storage devices for the cloud.

The concept of holographic storage dates back to the 1960’s, when laser was invented. It is a method of recording data in the form of holograms (three-dimensional images) inside an object by using light.

Cloud storage and challenges

According to the US-based company, about 125 zettabytes of data will be generated annually by 2024, and storing this in a cost-effective way is going to be a big challenge. (A zettabyte is about one trillion gigabytes.)

Conventional cloud storage systems use a mix of hard disk drives (HDDs) and flash storage (also used in USB drives) for storing and retrieving data.

The mechanical parts and magnetic disks on HDDs present some challenges in the long-run like slower data transfer speeds. While flash storage is capable of faster data transfer, it is considerably expensive than HDDs.

How does holographic storage work?

Holographic storage uses green lasers to write data pages containing hundreds of kilobytes of data in the form of a hologram inside a holographic crystal, which in this case is lithium niobate.

Also Read Microsoft's new technology to predict epidemics

There are two laser beams, one projects the data encoded in an image, and another, known as the reference beam, meets the first beam inside the holographic crystal, creating a hologram.

The data pages can be read by shining the reference laser beam at an angle off the recorded hologram, capturing this on a camera and extracting the image, which is then processed using software to access the data.

The holograms containing data can be erased with UV light, making the storage media rewritable. Holographic storage also allows multiple channels of read and write, simultaneously.

These holograms occupy a small area or volume within the crystal, and multiple data pages can be written or accessed in a particular volume just by changing the angle of light. While, in case of HDDs, it would require the movement of the entire mechanical drive to write or access even a small amount of data.

As a result, the data can be accessed at much higher speeds in holographic storage, potentially offering increased access rates because of lower time delays, according to Microsoft.

Microsoft claims, using high-resolution camera components and AI has enabled it to increase the storage density by 1.8x over the state-of-the-art volumetric holographic storage.

Design and future

The devices will be designed to fit in the storage racks used in cloud storage, allowing the team to design the new hardware at “rack scale.”

Also Read Google is the top cloud service provider for retailers, report says

Further, holographic storage can store information in a three-dimensional (3D) space, unlike other storage options like HDDs and flash storage, which use a two-dimensional (2D) space, allowing data to be stored more densely. So, more data can be stored in holographic storage in the same space compared with HDDs.

The practical use of the storage technology for the cloud in the future would involve developing methods that will allow for the scaling of the storage capacity by increasing the number of partitions inside the device while maintaining the same access rates across multiple partitions, Microsoft said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/h9uf7m/article32809802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Holographic-Storagejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microsofts-exploring-holographic-storage-devices-for-its-cloud-what-does-it-mean/article32809855.ece

13,2020/10/09,"Amid concerns, Donald Trump may campaign on October 10","With tensions building over the President’s diagnosis and questions about his judgment, Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview that he wants to hold a campaign rally as early as Saturday.

Donald Trump said he hopes to resume campaigning on Saturday after receiving a green light from his doctor, even as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled plans to probe the President’s capacity to govern after contracting COVID-19.

With just 26 days until the November 3 election, Washington’s top Democrat took the extraordinary step of proposing a commission to investigate Mr. Trump’s fitness for the job — and whether he needs removal under the Constitution’s 25th Amendment — which she will unveil in a Bill on Friday.

The move came after Mr. Trump spent the day ranting against critics and threw the debate schedule with Democrat Joe Biden into turmoil.

With tensions building over the president’s diagnosis and questions about his judgment, Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview late Thursday that he wants to hold a campaign rally as early as Saturday.

“I think I’m going to try doing a rally on Saturday night if we have enough time to put it together,” he said during an interview with Sean Hannity, adding that it would be “probably in Florida.”

Mr. Trump said that he might hold another rally the following day in Pennsylvania.

Earlier in the day Mr. Trump’s doctor gave him the green light to resume public activities this weekend.

“Saturday will be day 10 since Thursday’s diagnosis, and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the President’s safe return to public engagement at that time,” Dr. Sean Conley said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a15l5l/article32710961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THAPTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/amid-concerns-donald-trump-may-campaign-today/article32816380.ece
14,2020/10/09,Armenia-Azerbaijan talks begin in Moscow,"Aliyev calls it a historic opportunity.

Armenia and Azerbaijan held their first high-level talks on Friday after nearly two weeks of fierce clashes over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, with hopes rising that a ceasefire could be brokered in Moscow.

The Hindu Explains | What’s behind the Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes?

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who has repeatedly vowed to use his military to retake the breakaway province, said the talks represented a historic opportunity for Armenia.

“We are giving Armenia a chance to settle the conflict peacefully,” he said. “This is their last chance.”

Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said his country was “ready for the resumption of the peace process” led by international brokers.

15,2020/10/09,Expect China-style development for Sri Lanka: Gotabaya,"Chinese delegation is in Colombo; both sides agree to revive FTA negotiations.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Friday said he was targeting a China-style development model for Sri Lanka, even as he sought greater investment and a larger market from the Asian giant.

Following his meeting with a high-level delegation from Beijing in Colombo, a statement from the President’s office said plans were afoot to recommence discussions on the Sri Lanka-China Free Trade Agreement, and to swiftly complete the China-backed Hambantota Industrial Zone and the Port City in Colombo, a flagship $1.4 billion project in China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

Recalling his past visits to China — “13 times” — President Rajapaksa told the delegation: “I have seen massive development, especially in rural areas. My target is to bring about similar development, especially in rural areas in Sri Lanka, and to raise the living conditions of the people in this country, especially that of the poor. I look forward to seeing a visible progress in the Port City project over the next four years”, according to the media statement.

The delegation from Beijing was led by Yang Jiechi, a top foreign policy official and a Politburo member of the Chinese Communist Party. Officials in Sri Lanka’s Foreign Relations Ministry described the visit of the “high-powered” delegation as a “goodwill gesture”, following President Xi Jinping’s invitation to President Rajapaksa to China, following the latter’s election win last year. President Rajapaksa could not undertake the visit in the wake of the global pandemic.

In addition to pledging China’s continued support to Sri Lanka in international forums, including at the UN Human Rights Council, Mr. Yang said: “China’s assistance will not be just lip service but concrete action to achieve the development goals,” the statement issued by the President’s office said.

‘Debt trap’

Further, President Rajapaksa told the delegation that he wished to disprove the prevalent “debt-trap” analysis of Sri Lanka-China relations, in connection with the Hambantota Port, and sought China’s help in his endeavour of improving the living standards of people through the project. Building the port, strategically-located in the island’s southern tip, was Sri Lanka’s idea, not China’s, he said, adding: “We were convinced that it would be a project with a vast potential for generating income and employment opportunities. China offered to fund it.”

The statement made no reference to any new loans — China sanctioned a $500 million-loan in March to help Sri Lanka cope with the pandemic — or renegotiation of Sri Lanka’s existing debt of over $5 billion to China, though officials earlier indicated that Colombo might appeal to Beijing for a loan moratorium, just like it did to New Delhi.

However, President Rajapaksa sought China’s help to reduce the trade deficit between the two countries, the statement said.

Significantly, the two sides agreed to resume negotiation of the FTA, that Sri Lanka and China in 2013 agreed to enter. It was stalled in 2018, reportedly after Beijing turned down the former Colombo administration’s request to have the deal reviewed in 10 years.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qfdiwb/article32816164.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-SRILANKA-CHINA-DIPLOMACY-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/expect-china-style-development-for-sri-lanka-gotabaya/article32816165.ece
16,2020/10/09,Pakistan bans TikTok over ‘immoral’ content,"The PTA said in a statement that a “number of complaints from different segments of the society” were made “against immoral/indecent content” on TikTok.

Pakistan’s telecom watchdog on Friday banned the popular Chinese video-sharing app TikTok after getting numerous complaints against its immoral content.

The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said in a statement that a “number of complaints from different segments of the society” were made “against immoral/indecent content” on TikTok.

The regulator took the step after a “final notice” was given to TikTok to comply with the instructions for development of an effective mechanism for a proactive moderation of its unlawful online contents, it said.

However, TikTok failed to comply with the instructions which forced the PTA to ban it in the country.

The watchdog said that it was open for engagement with the mobile application’s parent company and would review its decision if a mechanism was developed to moderate the content as per the earlier instructions.

17,2020/10/09,"After Quad meet, China slams ‘closed and exclusive cliques’","China’s State media has been particularly critical of Mr. Pompeo, and highlighted the fact that he was the only one among the four ministers to directly mention China.

China on Friday said it was opposed to “organising closed and exclusive cliques”, underlining its wary response to this week’s ministerial meeting of the Quad grouping, or India, Australia, Japan and the United States.

At Tuesday’s ministerial meet in Tokyo, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo singled out China as a threat to the region, although the three other foreign ministers, including External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, did not directly mention China. They did, however, express broad concerns about maintaining a rules-based order, freedom of navigation and the peaceful resolution of disputes in the region.

“As partners in this Quad, it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the Chinese Communist Party’s exploitation, corruption, and coercion,” Mr. Pompeo said. “We’ve seen it in the South China Sea, in the East China Sea, the Mekong, the Himalayas, the Taiwan Straits. These are just a few examples.”

Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing on Friday, the first following the week-long national holiday in China, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in response to a question on the Quad meet, “This is now the 21st century and we are living in an era of globalisation. The interests of all the countries are so intertwined that organising closed and exclusive cliques will not help to build mutual trust and cooperation, especially when we are faced with urgent tasks of fighting the pandemic and reviving the world economy.”

“We hope countries will bear in mind the common interest of all countries and focus on beating the virus with collective efforts, while creating a peaceful environment and cooperation opportunities for the regional and global economic recovery,” she added.

China’s State media has been particularly critical of Mr. Pompeo, and highlighted the fact that he was the only one among the four ministers to directly mention China.

“Pompeo said it was critical now for the U.S.’s regional allies in the Indo-Pacific region to counter the Communist Party of China’s exploitation, coercion and corruption in the South and East China seas, the Mekong, the Himalayas, and the Taiwan Straits. Meanwhile, other Quad members have been cautious,” said a commentary in the Party-run Global Times by Shen Yi, professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai.

“Such a result could be argued as predictable, as each of the Quad members is calculating their own separate interests,” Mr. Shen said. “The U.S., which has signed military alliance treaties with Japan and Australia, now wants to rope India in to boost not only the alliance and to gang up on China. However, such a goal is not easy to realise. India is unlikely to take the U.S. side. It has been buttering its bread on both sides of major power games ever since the Cold War.”

Mr. Shen said “the U.S. is hoping to formalise the Quad into a NATO-like alliance” but the other members were less enthusiastic. “If the U.S. wants to count India in its ‘Asian NATO’, it would need to persuade India to give up its Russia-made weapons and substantially invest to change the standards of Indian firearms to the standards of the U.S.,” he said. “The U.S. has been barking aloud before and during the Quad meeting. But will it bite with expected ‘unity’ from the Quad? The answer is no.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hvdia3/article32814495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-DIPLOMACY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/after-quad-meet-china-slams-closed-and-exclusive-cliques/article32814497.ece

A Pakistani court has restrained the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) from arresting a physically-challenged journalist over his alleged objectionable tweets.

The Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued the orders on Thursday on a petition filed by journalist Rana Mohammad Arshad, directing that no adverse action shall be taken against the petitioner, the Dawn newspaper reported. The court adjourned the hearing in the case till October 12, it said.

The IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah also summoned the inquiry officer of the FIA’s Cybercrime Wing on October 12 along with the record against the journalist. A panel of lawyers representing the journalist informed the court that the petitioner was a physically-challenged person and working as a journalist.

They said that Mr. Arshad was being harassed by the FIA’s Cybercrime Wing because of opinions and views expressed by him on social media. According to one of the lawyers of the petitioner, the FIA has served the journalist an undated notice.

The counsel also termed the notice mala fide due to its vague content, the report said. He said that the journalist was summoned by the FIA and later his house was raided by officials of the agency.

However, it was not clear why the authorities wanted to arrest the journalist. Justice Minallah observed: The profession of the petitioner, fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 19 and 19-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and the manner in which the respondents (FIA) have so far proceeded in this case, prima facie, raises questions of public importance, particularly abuse of power under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.

The court directed the registrar office to issue notices to the FIA authorities. The officer who has been entrusted (with) inquiry of the case is directed to appear on the next date fixed and explain under what authority of law the undated notice was issued followed by raiding the house of the petitioner as has been alleged, the court order said.

The officer shall also explain why the alleged commission and omission on part of the petitioner were not disclosed in the undated notice, it said.

According to the report, this is the first case in Islamabad in which a legal committee constituted by the Pakistan Bar Council for defence of journalists has filed a petition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5ba23x/article31270427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-Islamabad-high-court-pakistan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/islamabad-high-court-restrains-fia-to-arrest-journalist-over-alleged-objectionable-tweets/article32814107.ece
19,2020/10/09,World Food Programme | Five things to know about 2020 Nobel Peace Prize winner,"WFP delivers food assistance in emergencies, from wars to civil conflicts, natural disasters and famines.

The UN’s World Food Programme, which won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, delivers food assistance in emergencies, from wars to civil conflicts, natural disasters and famines.

Here are five facts about the Rome-based organisation:

Beginnings

Created in 1962 on the request of US President Dwight Eisenhower as an experiment to provide food aid through the UN system, WFP had only existed a few months when an earthquake struck northern Iran.

Over 12,000 people died. WFP sent survivors 1,500 metric tons of wheat, 270 tonnes of sugar and 27 tonnes of tea.

Others soon needed its help: a typhoon made landfall in Thailand; war refugees needed feeding in Algeria.

Full list of Nobel prize 2020

In 1963 WFP’s first school meals project was born. In 1965, the agency became a fully-fledged UN programme.

By 2019, it would come to assist 97 million people in 88 countries. WFP says that on any given day it has 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and nearly 100 planes on the move. It distributes over 15 billion rations of food yearly.

Mission

WFP focuses on emergency assistance as well as rehabilitation and development aid. Two-thirds of its work is in conflict-affected countries, where people are three times more likely to be undernourished than elsewhere.

It works closely with the other two Rome-based UN agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which helps countries draw up policy and change legislation to support sustainable agriculture, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), which finances projects in poor rural areas.

WFP is funded entirely by voluntary donations, most of which comes from governments. It raised $8 billion in 2019, which it says was used to provide 4.2 million metric tons of food and $2.1 billion of cash and vouchers.

It has more than 17,000 staff, with 90 percent based in the countries where the agency provides assistance.

Where in the world?

There are few places where the WFP has not provided assistance. In western Sahel in the 1970s, ravaged by drought, it used “everything in its power — from car to camel, from road to river — to assist those in need”.

It delivered 2 million tonnes of food during Ethiopia’s 1984 famine. It was present in Sudan, Rwanda, and in Kosovo, then later in Asia after the 2004 tsunami, and Haiti’s 2010 earthquake.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is suffering the second largest hunger crisis in the world, it assisted 6.9 million people in 2019, as well as helping fight a deadly Ebola virus outbreak.

It helps 4.5 million people in war-torn Syria and 300,000 acutely malnourished children in conflict-struck Nigeria.

But WFP’s largest emergency response has been in Yemen, where it tries to feed 13 million people each month.

Hunger today and coronavirus

Over 821 million people in the world are chronically hungry, while another 135 million are facing severe hunger or starvation, and an additional 130 million could join them by the end of 2020 due to coronavirus, the agency warns.

The number of severely food insecure people in the world had already risen nearly 70 percent over the past four years, and the economic fallout from the virus pandemic is expected to spark “a hunger pandemic”, WFP said.

“We urgently need more support from donors, who of course are already hard-pressed by the impact of the pandemic in their own countries”.

Coronavirus

WFP’s logistics services used a network of hubs, passenger and cargo airlinks, and medical evacuation services to enabled a steady flow of cargo and workers to the frontlines of the pandemic.

The coronavirus fallout is being felt hardest in Latin America, which has seen an almost three-fold rise in the numbers of people requiring food assistance, as well as West, Central and Southern Africa.

“Before the coronavirus even became an issue, I was saying that 2020 would be facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II,” WFP’s executive director David Beasley told the UN security council this year.

“With Covid-19, we are not only facing a global health pandemic but also a global humanitarian catastrophe”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mspk87/article32813514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WORLDFOODPROGRAMME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world-food-programme-five-things-to-know-about-2020-nobel-peace-prize-winner/article32813515.ece
20,2020/10/09,World Food Programme wins Nobel Peace Prize 2020,"The World Food Programme, a United Nations body, is the world’s largest humanitarian organisation addressing hunger and promoting food security

The Nobel Peace Prize was Friday awarded to the World Food Programme for feeding millions of people from Yemen to North Korea, with the coronavirus pandemic seen pushing millions more into hunger.

The WFP was honoured for “its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict,” Nobel committee chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said on unveiling the winner in Oslo.

Whether delivering food by helicopter or on the back of an elephant or a camel, the WFP prides itself on being “the leading humanitarian organisation” in a world where, by its own estimates, some 690 million people -- one in 11 -- go to bed on an empty stomach.

“With this year's award, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to turn the eyes of the world towards the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger,” Reiss-Andersen said.

Full list of Nobel prize 2020

Founded in 1961, the UN organisation helped 97 million people last year, distributing 15 billion rations to people in 88 countries last year.

The numbers are dizzying but only a fraction of the total number in need.

Despite making progress over the past three decades, the UN's goal to eradicate hunger by 2030 appears out of reach if current trends continue, according to experts.

Women and children are usually those most at risk.

War can be caused by hunger, but hunger is also a consequence of war, with people living in areas of conflict three times more likely to be undernourished than those living in countries at peace, the WFP says.

“There's no two ways about it — we can't end hunger unless we put an end to conflict,” WFP executive director David Beasley said on September 21.

'Famines of biblical proportions'

Yemen, which is living through what the UN has described as the “largest humanitarian crisis in the world”, is a stark example of this.

Both the UN and aid agencies have repeatedly raised the alarm over the disastrous consequences of the conflict which has claimed tens of thousands of lives since 2015, when a powerful military coalition led by Saudi Arabia joined the government's fight against Iran-backed Huthi rebels.

The conflict has displaced three million people and pushed the country to the verge of famine.

Two-thirds of Yemen's 30 million people don't know where their next meal will come from, WFP figures show.

The outlook for the world has grown even bleaker this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to earnings losses, made food more expensive and disrupted supply chains.

“The coronavirus pandemic has contributed to a strong upsurge in the number of victims of hunger in the world,” the Nobel committee said.

“In countries such as Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Burkina Faso, the combination of violent conflict and the pandemic has led to a dramatic rise in the number of people living on the brink of starvation,” it said.

In April, Beasley raised the alarm, saying: “We could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months.”

The global recession caused by the virus risks pushing an additional 83 to 132 million people into hunger, the UN said in a report published in mid-July.

This is the 12th time the Peace Prize has gone to the UN, one of its agencies or personalities — more than any other laureate.

The virus will also affect the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony on December 10 in Oslo, which has been scaled back due to corona restrictions.

The award consists of a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for 10 million Swedish kronor (950,000 euros, $1.1 million).

On Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize for physiology and medicine for discovering the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus. Tuesday’s prize for physics honoured breakthroughs in understanding the mysteries of cosmic black holes, and the chemistry prize on Wednesday went to scientists behind a powerful gene-editing tool. American poet Louise Glück won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday.

Sri Lankan health authorities were working Friday to contain a growing cluster of new coronavirus infections, ordering the closure of bars, restaurants, casinos, nightclubs and spas.

The Indian Ocean island nation over the weekend reported its first locally transmitted infection in more than two months, a cluster centred around a garment factory in densely populated Western province.

By Friday the number of infections linked to the cluster climbed to 1,053, with more than 2,000 more people asked to quarantine at home. The majority of infected people are co-workers of the first patient, who is a worker at the garment factory.

22,2020/10/09,The Hindu Explains | What’s happening in Kyrgyzstan?,"Protesters have captured key government buildings, including the Parliament house and the presidential office and the absconding President has accused the opposition of plotting a coup.

The story so far: Street protests erupted in Kyrgyzstan earlier this week following Sunday’s parliamentary election. The opposition blamed the votes were rigged as protesters captured several government buildings in the capital Bishkek, forcing the President, Sooronbay Jeenbekov, to flee the White House, the presidential palace, and plunging the country into chaos.

What happened in the election?

Kyrgyzstan, often referred to as Central Asia’s only democracy, had seen violent anti-government protests in the past. In 2005 and 2010, sitting presidents were forced out of office in ‘Tulip’ and ‘Melon’ revolutions. The current protests began after early results of the October 4 parliamentary election were announced. Political parties in Kyrgyzstan should win at least 7% of the popular vote to enter Parliament. The results showed that only four parties managed to cross the threshold and of which, three were pro-government parties. The newly formed Birimdik (Unity) party emerged the biggest winner with 24.5% of the vote, while the Mekenim (My Homeland) Kyrgyzstan party got 23.88% and the Kyrgyzstan party 8.76%. The only opposition party that crossed the threshold was the nationalist Butun Kyrgyzstan, which won 7.13%. The remaining 12 parties received only around one-third of the ballots.

What’s behind the protests?

Even before the election, political fault lines were sharpening in Kyrgyzstan. The country’s main political party, the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan (SDPK), which had the most number of seats in the outgoing Parliament, stayed out of the election due to infighting between its founder and former President Almazbek Atambayev and the incumbent Mr. Jeenbekov. Mr. Atambayev, the one-time mentor of Mr. Jeenbekov, had clashed with the President publicly quite often after they fell out. Mr. Atambayev was jailed last year and sentenced on corruption charges. The former President’s sons had split with the SDPK and formed another party, the Social Democrats of Kyrgyzstan (SDK), a few months before the election. When most parties failed to make it to Parliament in Sunday’s election, the opposition, including the SDK, came together and launched the protests, accusing the government of vote buying. The protesters raided the prison where Mr. Atambayev was kept and freed him. They formed a Coordination Council to lead the “revolution”. The country’s Election Commission annulled the results, but the protesters continued.

Who is in charge now?

The protesters have captured key government buildings, including the Parliament house and the presidential office. President Jeenbekov’s whereabouts are unknown. In a video message from an undeclared location, he has accused the opposition of plotting a coup against his government. Prime Minister Kubatbek Boronov resigned on October 5 amid the upheaval. The Mekenchil party has nominated its leader Sadyr Japarov, who was also released from prison by the protesters, to the post of Prime Minister. The Bishkek Mayor and Governors of several regions have also resigned. President Jeenbekov assumed office in November 2017. Constitutionally, he has three more years left in office. But the protesters demand that Mr. Jeenbekov resign.

Why is Kyrgyzstan important?

This landlocked Central Asian country that shares a long border with China has been key to the strategic plans of both Russia and China. Moscow sees the region as its backyard and plays hard politics to retain its influence. For China, the country, located at the centre of Eurasia, is a vital link in its Belt and Road Initiative. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping had visited Bishkek. China has built road and rail networks with Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. During the early stages of the Afghan war, the U.S. had used Kyrgyzstan for refuelling and other logistical purposes. The U.S. base was shut down in 2014 by Parliament.

Where do the protests leave Russia?

Kyrgyzstan is a member of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation and hosts a Russian air base. While Russia has cultivated strong ties with all political factions in Kyrgyzstan, radical political changes could throw up opportunities for its rivals. While it is to be seen whether President Jeenbekov, who is still legally in power, would be able to mobilise its authority, what’s evident is that the crisis poses an immediate foreign policy challenge to Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Belarus, another country in Russia’s backyard with a pro-Moscow President, is already witnessing political turmoil after August’s Presidential election. In the South Caucasus, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet Republics, over Nagorno-Karabakh, risks dragging Russia into a conflict it doesn’t want. All three combined, Moscow’s attempts to build stronger political and economic integration with the former Soviet region are suddenly facing critical challenges.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wf9h3i/article32812355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THKYRGYZSTAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-hindu-explains-whats-happening-in-kyrgyzstan/article32812356.ece
23,2020/10/09,"Nancy Pelosi unveils 25th Amendment bid, questions Donald Trump’s fitness","The bill would set up a commission to assess the President’s ability to lead the country and ensure a continuity of government.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled legislation on October October 9 that would allow Congress to intervene under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to remove the President, insisting it’s not about President Donald Trump but inspired by the need for greater congressional oversight of his White House.

Ms. Pelosi has been raising questions about Mr. Trump’s mental fitness since his COVID-19 diagnosis and demanding more transparency about his health. The bill would set up a commission to assess the President’s ability to lead the country and ensure a continuity of government. It comes one year after Ms. Pelosi’s House launched impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.

""This is not about President Donald Trump — he will face the judgment of the voters,” Ms. Pelosi said at a press conference at the Capitol.

Just weeks before the November 3 election, with no hopes of the bill becoming law, the rollout was quickly dismissed as a stunt by Mr. Trump’s team and top allies.

""It’s an absurd proposal,” said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Fox.

“Absolutely absurd,” said Senate Majority Leader McConnell during an appearance in Shepherdsville, Kentucky.

The President’s opponents have discussed invoking the 25th Amendment for some time, but are raising it now, so close to Election Day, as the campaigns are fast turning into a referendum on Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Ms. Pelosi said Mr. Trump needs to disclose more about his health after his COVID-19 diagnosis and when, exactly, he first contracted COVID-19 as others in the White House have become infected. More than 210,000 Americans have died and millions more have tested positive for the virus, which shows no signs of abating heading into what public health experts warn will be a difficult flu season and winter.

The legislation that would create a commission as outlined under the 25th Amendment, which was passed by Congress and ratified in 1967 as a way to ensure a continuity of power in the aftermath of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination.

It says the Vice-President and a majority of principal officers of the executive departments “or of such other body as Congress” may by law provide a declaration to Congress that the President “is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. At that point, the Vice-President would immediately assume the powers of acting President.

""Let Congress exert the power the Constitution gave us,” Ms. Pelosi said on October 9 standing before a poster of the amendment.

Ms. Pelosi was joined by Representative Jamie Raskin, a constitutional scholar, who has proposed similar bills in the past.

""In times of chaos we must hold fast to our Constitution,” he said on October 9.

Mr. Raskin said the commission would be launched “only for the most extreme situations”.

But, as Congress showed by impeaching — and acquitting the President over 2019 — the legislative branch is determined to exert itself at times as a check on the executive branch.

""Congress has a role to play,” Mr. Raskin said.

Mr. Trump says he “feels great” after being hospitalised and is back at work in the White House. But his doctors have given mixed signals about his diagnosis and treatment. Trump plans to resume campaigning soon.

Congress is not in legislative session, and so any serious consideration of the measure, let alone votes in the House or Senate, is unlikely. But the bill serves as a political tool to stoke questions about Trump’s health as his own White House is hit by an outbreak infecting top aides, staff and visitors, including senators.

In a stunning admission, Mr. McConnell said on October 8 that he had stopped going to the White House two months ago because he disagreed with its coronavirus protocols. His last visit was on August 6.

""My impression was their approach to how to handle this was different from mine and what I insisted we do in the Senate, which is to wear a mask and practice social distancing,” Mr. McConnell said at a campaign stop in northern Kentucky for his own reelection.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3b5gcm/article32817295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pelosijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nancy-pelosi-unveils-25th-amendment-bid-questions-donald-trumps-fitness/article32811247.ece
24,2020/10/09,Coronavirus | China joins COVAX vaccine alliance,"The alliance is designed so that richer countries agree to buy into potential vaccines and help finance access for poorer ones.

China, which has four coronavirus vaccine candidates in stage 3 clinical trials, said on Friday that it is joining the coronavirus vaccine alliance known as COVAX.

The country signed an agreement with GAVI, the co-leader of the alliance, on Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Initially, China did not agree to join the alliance, missing the global deadline to join in September.

“We are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support COVAX,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.

It is not yet clear the exact terms of the agreement and how China will contribute. The country’s leader Xi Jinping previously said that China would make the vaccine a global public good.

25,2020/10/09,U.S. presidential polls | Trump campaign proposes new debate dates; Biden team rejects,"The U.S. President had earlier rejected a virtual debate with the Democratic presidential candidate

U.S. President Donald Trump’s election campaign on Thursday proposed pushing back the dates of the remaining two presidential debates dates by a week, a move immediately rejected by the Joe Biden campaign.

The Presidential debates were to be originally held on September 28, October 15 and 22. The Trump campaign’s proposal came hours after the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) said that the second debate scheduled in Miami on October 15 will take the form of a town meeting, in which the candidates would participate from separate, remote locations.

The commission cited the safety of all involved for the online event. Trump refused to participate in it, calling it a “waste of time”.

“I’m not going to do a virtual debate. I’m not going to waste my time at a virtual debate. That’s not what debating is all about. It’s ridiculous. And then they cut you off whenever they want,” Trump told Fox News in a telephonic interview soon after the format changes were announced.

The Trump campaign said the dates must be changed instead of changing the format of the debate, alleging the commission wants to shift the attention from Vice President Mike Pence’s performance against challenger Kamala Harris in the vice presidential debate on Wednesday.

“As President Trump said a virtual debate is a non-starter and would clearly be a gift to Biden because he would be relying on his teleprompter from his basement bunker. Voters should have the opportunity to directly question Biden’s 47-year failed record of leadership,” said Bill Stepien, ‘Trump 2020’ campaign manager.

“We agree that this should happen on October 22, and accordingly, the third debate should then be shifted back one week to October 29. The commission and the media cannot hide Joe Biden forever. Americans deserve to hear directly from both presidential candidates on these dates, October 22 and 29, Stepien said.

'Trump's erratic behaviour'

The Biden campaign completely dismissed the proposal.

Donald Trump doesn’t make the debate schedule; the Debate Commission does, said ‘Biden for President’ deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield.

""We accepted the three dates September 29, October 15, and October 22 — in June. Trump chose today to pull out of the October 15th debate. Trump’s erratic behaviour does not allow him to rewrite the calendar, and pick new dates of his choosing,"" she said.

""We look forward to participating in the final debate, scheduled for October 22, which already is tied for the latest debate date in 40 years. Donald Trump can show up, or he can decline again. That’s his choice,""” Bedingfield said.

Responding to reporters, Biden avoided a directed answer. I don’t know what the president is going to do. He changes his mind every second. For me to comment on that now would be irresponsible. I think that if I can follow the commission’s recommendations — if he goes off and has a rally, I’ll — I don’t know what I’ll do, said the Democratic presidential candidate.

Trump alleged that everybody is trying to protect Biden. They tried to protect Biden. Everybody is. They’re trying -- like that NBC disaster where he went on the show with Lester Holt. It was like it was meant for a child. It wasn’t meant for a grown person, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/crg0hy/article32605977.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIDEN-TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-polls-trump-campaign-proposes-new-debate-dates-biden-team-rejects/article32809773.ece
26,2020/10/09,Brazil strains at quarantine as coronavirus cases pass 5 million,"Experts warn of a possible second wave

Dozens of people converged on the cobblestone streets of downtown Rio de Janeiro for its traditional Pedra do Sal samba party — the first since the coronavirus pandemic began - and it seemed Brazil was returning to normal.

Among those dancing Monday were Luana Jatobŕ and two friends, all of whom overcame COVID-19. As a nurse technician caring for coronavirus patients, she knows better than most that occupancy rates at Rio’s intensive-care units have surged as the city’s seven-day average number of cases reaches its highest level since June.

Watch | Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine shows positive results

But, she said, everyone is desperate for a respite from the gloom.

""We take care of the people who are sick with COVID, but something that isn’t discussed is that there’s a very serious disease all over the world, which is depression,” said Jatobŕ. “After confinement, this samba circle is really to rescue those who felt downbeat and were oppressed. It’s not just the virus that kills.”

Brazilians, like many across the world, are burned out on quarantine. The somewhat slower pace of COVID-19’s spread, combined with less media coverage after it moved beyond Brazil’s two biggest cities, has helped people put the disease out of mind. But it continues to rip through Latin America’s largest country, and mayors — many of whom aren’t keen to keep restrictions in place ahead of November elections — are reopening their cities.

And experts are warning of a possible second wave.

At its height, Brazil was registering more than 45,000 cases and 1,000 deaths per day. Those totals took the shape of a months-long plateau, unlike most other countries whose viral curves had defined peaks. While Brazil’s figures have fallen to about 27,000 cases and 700 deaths daily - significant improvement, clearly - it’s still nothing to sneeze at.

Brazil surpassed 5 million confirmed cases on Wednesday night and is verging on 150,000 dead, the second-most in the world, according to the tally from Johns Hopkins University.

""People thought it unacceptable that 1,000 people were dying every day two months ago, and now they are fine with 700 people dying every day. It simply doesn’t make any sense,” said Pedro Hallal, an epidemiologist who coordinates the Federal University of Pelotas’ testing program, by far the country’s most comprehensive. “We can say the worst part of the first wave is done, and now obviously we need to continue to be monitoring to see if numbers go up again.”

The University of Miami’s observatory for COVID-19 in the Americas indicates that, at Brazil’s state level, the number of policies adopted to counter infection have fallen to the third-lowest in the region, behind Nicaragua, which declined to muster any meaningful response, and Uruguay, where virus incidence is among the world’s lowest.

The phenomenon is visible in Brazil’s cities, too, as campaigning mayors allow bars, restaurants and movie theaters to reopen, encouraging people to emerge from quarantine. Brazil’s statistics institute released data last week showing that the percentage of people in strict isolation or leaving home only when necessary dropped to 57% in mid-September, from 68% in early July.

""Mayors running for reelection have no interest in imposing any kind of lockdown or restrictions,” said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil’s Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. Their incentive now is to roll back pandemic measures, he added.

Limitations that ostensibly remain are often ignored. For example, Rio’s beaches have been packed on recent weekends, despite the fact sunbathing remains prohibited.

""In the Brazilian tradition, there are laws that stick and others that don’t,” Alvaro Costa e Silva, a columnist for Brazil’s biggest newspaper, Folha de S.Paulo, wrote this week. “To maintain what today is considered mental health, filling beaches and gathering in bars became a tolerated compulsion in Rio.”

As shops and some offices reopen in Sao Paulo, traffic jams in South America’s biggest city have started making a comeback. By mid-September, mobility across Brazil had returned to normal levels, according to the University of Miami’s COVID-19 observatory, based on GPS data from Google.

In Amazonas state, where early on the pandemic slammed the capital, Manaus, and forced cemeteries to dig mass graves, mobility was 24% above pre-pandemic levels. A fresh surge of cases prompted local authorities in late September to reinstate restrictions on commerce and gatherings, and to shut down the riverside beachfront.

""I wouldn’t recommend governments to relax further; there’s still room for big spikes based on people moving around and not wearing masks,” said Michael Touchton, a political science professor at the University of Miami, and co-founder of its observatory. “A second peak is still quite possible in Brazil.”

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the severity of COVID-19 from the start, and insisted that shutting down economies will inflict worse hardship on working-class families than the disease. He told the United Nations General Assembly last month that the virus and joblessness were problems that needed solving simultaneously, and touted emergency cash payouts that helped 65 million Brazilians through the downturn.

But his government hasn’t implemented a comprehensive national testing policy to identify cases swiftly and prevent their spread, nor shown any sign it intends to, according to Hallal. On the contrary, the Health Ministry yanked financing of his university’s testing program in 133 cities after its third phase, forcing him to seek private funding for its fourth and upcoming fifth phases.

Results from the most recent phase, conducted in late August, found an average 1.4% infection rate in 33,250 people, down from 3.8% in June. While the rate was just 0.8% in Rio and Sao Paulo, 23 cities - almost all in Brazil’s north and northeast - had triple that level or more.

""The population is behaving like the pandemic has been controlled, which isn’t true,” said Margareth Dalcolmo, a respiratory medicine professor at the state-funded Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, who is also lead researcher for one of several vaccine studies in Brazil. “The official discourse, versus the pressure from business and mayors to reopen everything, leaves people confused about what recommendations to follow. That’s a big challenge in Brazil.”

Back at the samba party in Rio, partygoers showed they still remember how to quickstep without spilling their plastic cups of beer. A couple danced cheek to cheek. The percussionists striking their drums and tambourine wore masks, but few spectators followed their lead.

Still, one of the event’s organizers, Jeferson dos Santos, celebrated the return of the longed-for rhythm.

""Today we have the first wave of samba, all the musicians are wearing their masks, all playing and respecting World Health Organization norms,” dos Santos said. “We hope everything goes right, with God’s will. We’re in that positive vibe.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/oinf98/article32809596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRAZIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brazil-strains-at-quarantine-as-coronavirus-cases-pass-5-million/article32809597.ece
27,2020/10/09,Bihar Assembly elections | Congress to stress need for change,"Large-scale migration of workers, unemployment and women’s security to feature prominently

Creating employment opportunities, including filling up existing government vacancies; sops for farmers, plans to tackle large-scale migration of labour; and improving security for women, are among some of the key promises that the Congress party is going to make in its Bihar manifesto, a party leader said on Friday.

To be called the “Parivartan Patra” (document for change), the Congress is likely to focus on recent issues that have shaped the Opposition party’s politics. For example, to go with the party’s ongoing protests over the three recently enacted farm bills, the manifesto will talk about offering minimum support price (MSP), and government procurement to farmers, if it comes to power.

Though large sections of the population in the State are engaged in agriculture, the system of offering MSP to farmers is not followed, as it is done in Punjab and Haryana.

Another recent issue that will figure in the manifesto would be the party’s plan to prevent large-scale migration from the State.

Bihar, along with Uttar Pradesh, witnessed the largest reverse migration in the initial period of the lockdown ordered to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Nearly 40 lakh migrant workers from these two States were estimated to have returned, many on foot from their workplaces in other States, after losing their livelihoods because of the COVID-19 shutdown.

“The Congress manifesto will talk about increasing rural employment opportunities by increasing avenues under the MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), so that more people can be absorbed within the State,” said the party functionary. There will also be a plan for skill development for workers, and a promise of equal pay for equal work, he added.

Law and order, and crimes against women, will also have a special focus as Bihar had seen 18,587 cases of crimes against women in 2019, as per latest data from the National Crime Records Bureau.

On Thursday, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev had attacked the Janata Dal-United and Nitish Kumar for giving a ticket to former minister Manju Verma from Begusarai as her husband, Chandrashekhar Verma was an accused in the Muzzafurpur shelter home scandal in which 34 minor girls were sexually abused.

“Immediately, they should cancel her candidature. I hope Prime Minister Narendra Modi-ji, who consistently says Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (save the girl child, educate the girl child) walks the talk and makes sure that this lady’s candidature is cancelled,” Ms. Dev had said at a press conference.

Of the 243 Assembly seats in the State, the Congress is contesting in 70 seats in an alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Left parties. The RJD is contesting in 144 seats and is leading the coalition.

The Election Commission on Friday decided to double the broadcast and telecast time allotted to all national and State parties on All India Radio and Doordarshan for the Bihar Assembly elections due to the increased importance of non-contact based campaigning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and enhanced relevance of non-contact based campaign, Election Commission of India, in consultation with Prasar Bharati Corporation, has decided to double the broadcast/telecast time allotted to each national party and recognised State party of Bihar on Doordarshan and All India Radio during the ongoing general election to the Legislative Assembly of Bihar, 2020,” an EC statement said.

According to the EC order, the BJP has been allotted 427 minutes of broadcast and telecast time each, while the Rashtriya Janata Dal has been given 343 minutes each, the Janata Dal (United) has 323 minutes each and the Congress 182 minutes each of broadcast and telecast time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/yv2183/article32765310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-ECI-LOGO,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/ec-doubles-broadcast-time-for-parties-on-dd-air-for-bihar-polls/article32816220.ece
29,2020/10/09,"Facebook, Twitter dismantle global array of disinformation networks","In separate statements, the two companies said they had identified and suspended more than 3,500 accounts between them, which used fake identities and other deceptive behaviours to spread false or misleading information

Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc said on Thursday they had taken down more than a dozen disinformation networks used by political and state-backed groups in multiple countries to deceive users on their platforms.

In separate statements, the two companies said they had identified and suspended more than 3,500 accounts between them, which used fake identities and other deceptive behaviours to spread false or misleading information.

The networks targeted users in a wide selection of countries, including the United States where officials have warned that foreign governments are attempting to influence the outcome of November's presidential election.

After coming under heavy fire for failing to stop alleged Russian efforts to sway the 2016 U.S. election, Facebook and Twitter have announced a string of high-profile takedowns in the weeks leading up to this year's presidential vote.

In multiple cases, the social media companies have worked with U.S. law enforcement to track and dismantle political influence campaigns targeting U.S. voters which have been attributed to foreign states, most notably Iran and Russia.

Tehran and Moscow have repeatedly denied the allegations.

The takedowns announced on Thursday covered networks with a global reach far beyond the U.S. election. The operations targeted Internet users in at least 16 other countries ranging from Azerbaijan to Nigeria and Japan, Facebook and Twitter said.

Twitter said the five networks it had suspended were separately linked to groups with ties to the governments of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Thailand and Russia.

“Our goal with these disclosures is to continue to build public understanding around the ways in which state actors try to abuse and undermine open democratic conversation,” the company said in a statement.

Facebook said it had found 10 networks, some of which it had previously identified publicly. The networks were predominantly tied to political groups who targeted domestic audiences, it said, including the Myanmar military and the youth wing of Azerbaijan's ruling party.

“Deceptive campaigns like these raise particularly complex issues by blurring the line of a healthy public debate and manipulation,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy.

Facebook also banned a U.S. marketing firm named Rally Forge, which it said had worked with conservative activism organization Turning Point USA and a self-proclaimed environmental body called Inclusive Conservation Group.

Accounts controlled by Rally Forge attempted to influence public conversations around news events by flooding the comments section of news articles from prominent outlets, Facebook said.

The Washington Post has reported that Turning Point USA was responsible for a “spam-like” political messaging campaign, which pumped out 4,500 tweets containing identical content. At the time, Twitter suspended 20 accounts and Facebook said it would investigate the activity.

Turning Point said the allegations related to a separate entity. “The mistake has been flagged with Facebook's communication team,” it said in a statement.

Messages left with Rally Forge and its Phoenix area-based president, Jake Hoffman, were not immediately returned. Reuters was unable to reach representatives for Inclusive Conservation Group.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/l82z69/article32810633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09NETFACEBOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/facebook-twitter-dismantle-global-array-of-disinformation-networks/article32810634.ece
30,2020/10/09,A tale of two deaths,"The government cannot be Hercule Poirot in one case and Inspector Goon in another

Mumbai, Maharashtra. June 14, 2020: an actor, 34, is found dead in his apartment.

Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. September 14, 2020: a Dalit woman, 19, is brutally assaulted in a bajra field. She later dies.

Three months between the two tragedies but an ocean of difference in the state’s response to each. And in the response of the media and that all-pervasive, hydra-headed creature called social media.

In the former case, despite everything pointing overwhelmingly to suicide, there was a concerted media campaign that successively dragged in drugs, money laundering and murder with wild abandon. With each new allegation, the voices on TV got louder and the theories more bizarre, even as actual proof got thinner and thinner. Unfazed by this, the government saw fit to assign an alphabet soup of central agencies to investigate — CBI, NCB, ED. From drugs to dirty money to murder, each theory has been slowly eliminated, but the shouting continues.

In the Hathras case, meanwhile, the young woman was found, naked and semi-paralyzed, by her mother. Rushed to hospital, she named her assailants — privileged caste men from her village — and said she had been assaulted. She used the word zabardasti, a Hindi euphemism for ‘rape’. She subsequently died.

In stark contrast to the death of a star in Mumbai, when every wacky conspiracy theory was taken at its word and diligently followed up by the government, in Hathras even the most obvious allegations — that of rape and caste atrocity — are being shrugged off. Unlimited time and personnel were devoted to the actor’s death, with everyone and their aunt becoming narcotics and forensic experts overnight. In Hathras, however, demands for justice are being labelled “nefarious plots”. Dozens of FIRs have since been issued — not only in connection with the murder, but for “violating Sec. 144”, for “sedition”, “instigation” and “criminal conspiracy”. Clearly, protesting crime is as unlawful as crime itself.

According to basic police procedure, if an injured woman is brought in, she should be immediately checked for signs of sexual assault. Yet this woman’s vaginal swab was taken 10 days later, when semen and other signs would be long gone. Nor are the police revealing whether the woman’s clothes were preserved, or samples taken from her fingernails and skin for DNA testing. When a sensitive case is under investigation, conscientious police procedure would ideally keep the victim’s body in the morgue to facilitate further examination. Yet this woman’s body was cremated by the police with unholy haste. The law says that even if there is an allegation of sexual violence, the victim’s name cannot be revealed, yet this woman’s name was revealed in public by Amit Malviya, the chief of BJP’s IT cell. The law states that a dying declaration is admissible in evidence and can form the basis of conviction, yet this woman’s statement is being side-stepped.

One is compelled to ask: what happened to the sharp detective instincts we used when it was an actor’s death? Did three months of continuous use blunt the government’s and certain TV anchors’ investigative knives? Or did they get dulled by the balmy air of Uttar Pradesh?

It is facile to keep pointing to politicians and television anchors and WhatsApp forwards and talk of how insidiously they corrupt agendas and muddy the waters. They would not be able to do this quite so well if large sections of the great middle and upper classes, the avid consumers and engine drivers of this neo-liberal economy, did not so willingly swallow everything they are told. There comes a point when we need to stop and ask if we will only listen to TV hosts and slick propaganda posts or if we will also listen to our conscience. A point when we ask why an actor’s death outranks a Dalit teenager’s murder in our outrage meter. A point when we question why we are suddenly so comfortable with electioneering becoming unconscionable. That point is now.

We are demolishing our old apartment complex and constructing a new one by way of a joint development. Some of the flat owners within the complex are of the opinion that since the existing layout is more than 30 years old, open space reservation (OSR) is not required.

OSR will not be applicable if the extent of site is below 3,000 sq.m. If the land is more than the exempted limit, at the time of processing your building plan approvals, the authorities will determine the OSR requirements based on the size of the plot. The final approval will be issued only after transfer of OSR land, if the same is applicable.

32,2020/10/09,Banking on data centres,"The focus will be on backing leading operators and funding prominent developers to foray into the segment, says Anshuman Magazine

India is fast becoming a digital economy with an exponential growth in data generation.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) highlights that India currently has 1.2 billion people with a unique digital identity, 637 million total Internet subscribers, with 9.1 GB data consumed per subscriber per month and 350 million smart phone devices.

This, combined with the increased adoption of cloud computing, has created an unparalleled demand for Data Centres (DCs) in the country.

Various digitisation initiatives by the Indian government, such as Smart Cities and Digital India, have further led to a data explosion in India. This got a further boost by the rapid digital transformation of various industries such as e-commerce, telecom, financial services, online food delivery apps, and even the manufacturing sector.

Currently in India, the total Internet hits have surged between 50% and 70%, whereas streaming has jumped by at least 12%.

The absorption rate of online gaming transactions has increased to a staggering 97%. Given these numbers, India holds enormous potential to become the ‘next destination’ for these centres.

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this projection will be realised sooner than later. Amidst the current downturn, DCs are among one of the best protected sectors. All the applications we are using to function effectively during the current crisis are ultimately powered by DCs, and therefore their role today is critical for all aspects of life.

Technology and automation provide a significant opportunity to make steep changes in terms of how DC operations evolve as we move forward in the next 3-5 years. CBRE insights highlight that their capacity is expected to grow two-fold by FY-25 from the current 500-520 MW. Major Indian cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune and NCR are expected to witness supply addition of upto 40% in 2020. With 41% data center capacity, Mumbai leads the data center requirements, followed by Bangalore (17%) and Delhi (16%).

Current trends

The demand for outsourced DCs has increased in India and occupiers would require flexible, scalable DC solutions that are both operationally and financially optimal.

Understanding the demand of the market, CBRE has launched Data Centre Advisory Services that enables leaders to transform their businesses with more relevant information with the least amount of effort. Our detailed analysis aids customers to leverage Data Centre & IT strategy by suggesting workload movements to the best DC/Cloud platform (depending on the application design landscape). The analysis also gives insights to systems and applications which continue to be maintained in house.

The below trends are being witnessed across the industry:

Fund deployment to rise: CBRE expects that global players will continue to take interest in investing in the country, with a focus on backing leading operators or funding prominent developers to foray into the DC segment in 2020.

Further, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 situation in India, corporates would be inclined towards investing in the cloud segment as businesses are moving online and both employees and employers prefer the work-from-home option.

Transition from captive to co-location and cloud DCs: Occupiers’ demand for co-location space over captive DCs is further likely to get a boost due to the categorisation of third-party DCs as ‘Essential Services’ ensuring uninterrupted and uneventful operations even during a pandemic situation like today. With regulatory requirements for data storage expected to be implemented in the coming quarters, corporates are now expected to re-evaluate their DC portfolios in the country.

Edge computing to become a part of DC portfolios: On the back of their ability to service precise geographic zones, cities such as Kolkata, Pune, Gurgaon, Kochi and Jaipur, particularly, are likely to be amongst the first ones to witness edge DCs in the next few years.

Sustained policy impetus to spur DC demand: The passage of policies such as the National E-commerce Policy and Personal Data Protection Bill will mandate Indian consumers’ data to reside within the country, thereby boosting the demand for DCs. Further, large-scale, nationwide initiatives such as ‘Make in India ‘, ‘Digital India’ and Smart City Mission in particular would further augment DC demand.

The expanding e-commerce segment in India will also amplify the sector’s demand as the segment increasingly needs help in managing its growing database. Along with National E-commerce Policy other measures such as the Personal Data Protection Bill, proposed policy on Data Centre Parks and digital initiatives by the government will accelerate demand.

Bengaluru Urban reported 5,009 cases and 57 of the 114 deaths, raising the toll in the district to 3,290.

The State carried out 1,09,980 tests, including 49,618 rapid antigen tests.

Kerala registered 9,250 new cases on Friday, and tested 68,321 samples. The test positivity rate showed a slight dip from 14.6% to 13.5%

Thursday’s sudden drop in daily cases by nearly half the previous day’s number had cut the test positivity rate from the 14.6% to 8.6% and was seen as a statistical aberration or technical glitch during data upload, experts said.

The chairperson of the State Government’s expert committee on COVID-19, B. Ekbal, clarified that the steep decline in cases and test positivity rate on Thursday was not an indication of the epidemic curve going down, but could be “Statistical Noise” (random irregularity in any real life data). Going by the current trends, the epidemic curve could plateau by October end, he said.

On Friday, 25 more deaths were added to the official list. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for seven deaths, while there were four each in Kollam, Ernakulam and Malappuram, two in Alapuzha and one each in Kozhikode, Kasaragod, Kottayam and Thrissur.

Telangana, on the other hand, recorded 1,891 coronavirus cases on Thursday. Seven more persons succumbed to the virus. Greater Hyderabad had the major share of new cases, at 285. Medchal-Malkajgiri and Rangareddy districts 195 and 175 new cases respectively, Nalgonda 128 and Karimnagar reported 97 cases.

Kumrambheem Asifabad district reported the lowest cases at 10, Narayanpet (13) and Bhupalpally (18).

Andhra Pradesh added 5,145 new infections and 31 deaths on Friday.

The death rate was the highest in Krishna at 1.57%, and Chittoor was next at 1.01%. In other districts, the death rate was less than 1%.

The number of tests conducted touched 64.20 lakh, including 70,521 more daily samples tested. While the overall positivity rate was 11.60%, the figure in the last day was 7.30%. New cases and deaths were as follows: West Godavari (862 & 1), Chittoor (757 & 4), East Godavari (738 & 3), Prakasam (486 & 5), Kadapa (352 & 1), Guntur (342 & 1), Nellore (310 & 3), Krishna (310 & 3), Anantapur (285 & 3), Kurnool (211 & 1), Vizianagaram (194 & 1), Visakhapatnam (159 & 4) and Srikakulam (139 & 1).

34,2020/10/09,U.S. Deputy Secretary Biegun to visit Delhi ahead of 2+2,"The 2+2 dialogue is scheduled to be held on October 26 and 27 in New Delhi.

In the run up to the U.S.- India 2+2 foreign and defence ministers’ meeting this year, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun is scheduled to visit New Delhi from October 12 -14.

The dialogue, between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and their American counterparts, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper, is scheduled to be held on October 26 and 27 in New Delhi.

Mr. Biegun will meet with senior government officials and deliver the keynote address at the India-U.S. Forum (a platform convened by the Ananta Centre and the External Affairs Ministry).

“Building on Secretary Pompeo’s October 6 meeting with Indian Minister of External Affairs Dr. S. Jaishankar and ahead of the U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue later this year, Deputy Secretary Biegun’s engagements in India will focus on advancing the United States-India Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership and how the United States and India can work together to advance peace, prosperity, and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe,” a statement from the U.S. State Department said.

Mr Jaishankar and Mr Pompeo held a bilateral meeting in Tokyo on October 6, along the sidelines of the second Quad ministerial meeting between India, the U.S., Japan and Australia.

The agenda for the 2+2 is expected to include defence, economic cooperation, diplomatic cooperation, cooperation at multilateral forums, space and technology and people to people cooperation, a senior State Department official had told reporters last week in Washington. The meeting comes months before India is to begin a two year term on the U.N Security Council.

The last 2+2 meeting was held in Washington in December and coincided with the impeachment of Donald Trump by the U.S. House of Representatives. (There was an intercessional meeting last month). This year the meeting’s backdrop will include the global pandemic and the recent clashes between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and growing aggression by China on several fronts in Asia.

The U.S.’ relationship with China is also highly strained over bilateral trade issues, Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific and allegations over China’s public health response in the early days of the virus.

After his Delhi visit, Mr. Biegun will fly to Dhaka for meetings with senior government officials to “reaffirm” the U.S.- Bangladesh partnership, advance the Indo-Pacific agenda, discuss the response to COVID-19 and sustainable economic development, as per the State Department.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/asc27n/article32816244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TH-STEPHEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-deputy-secretary-biegun-to-visit-delhi-ahead-of-22/article32816245.ece
35,2020/10/09,Coronavirus | Indian Medical Association voices concern over Harsh Vardhan’s pitch for Ayush treatment for COVID-19,"Medical body calls for evidence to back Health Minister’s suggested protocol

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has questioned Health Minister Harsh Vardhan about issuing Ayush treatment protocol for COVID-19 treatment and asked him to explain on what basis these recommendations were made.

In a communication addressed to the Health Minister, the Association said: “He (Harsh Vardhan) has arranged impressive names of institutions to support his prescription. He admits that these are based on empirical evidence which means that the evidence is anecdotal and based on individual subjective experiences. He himself relegates AYUSH as history rather than current by saying Ayurveda has contributed to the foundation of modern medicine.”

For mild cases

AYUSH secretary Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, speaking about the protocol earlier this week at a Health Ministry press conference, had specified that the protocol is not COVID treatment and should be only considered as a support to those having mild COVID symptoms.

He said studies have indicated that these therapies may help in arresting the progress of the virus in mild cases and are found to provide overall immunity boost.

Mr Kotecha added that the results of the studies conducted have been placed in the public domain.

Meanwhile, the IMA in its letter, has demanded to know if there is satisfactory evidence regarding the claims made from studies done on COVID-19 patients and if so whether the evidence is weak or moderate or strong?

“The evidence should be in public domain and available for scientific scrutiny,” it said.

It also demanded how many of Mr Vardhan’s ministerial colleagues have so far made the informed choice of getting treated under these AYUSH protocols? The Association asked what was stopping him from handing over COVID care and control to the AYUSH ministry?

“IMA demands that the Union Health Minister should come clean on the above posers. If not, he is inflicting a fraud on the nation and gullible patients by calling placebos as drugs,” the IMA said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ms4uo1/article31312187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-HarshVardhan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ima-voices-concern-over-vardhans-pitch-for-ayush-treatment-for-covid-19/article32816170.ece
36,2020/10/09,"SARS-CoV-2 not the last virus to spark a pandemic, says expert","Next such virus could be a ‘MERS-2’, warns Professor of Microbiology Susan Weiss

The SARS-CoV-2 wouldn’t be the last such virus of its kind — in terms of its ability to rapidly spread among people — and the next such virus of its kind could be a “MERS-2” even (a reference to the Middle Eastern Respiratory Virus that is more lethal but less contagious), said Susan Weiss, Professor of Microbiology at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.

Prof. Weiss was the key note speaker at the first TNQ-Janelia India COVID-19 Seminar, 2020. The first of the three online-only talks commenced on Friday.

Also participating were Shahid Jameel, virologist and Director, Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University, and Satyajit Mayor, Director, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru.

The SARS-CoV-2 viruses, said Prof. Weiss, used multiple paths of entry to gain access to the cell and multiply. However, all the evidence pointed to the virus having evolved naturally and was not the results of being manufactured in a lab as it was highly unlikely that somebody would design the specific mutations that allowed the virus to so efficiently target the human host cells, she emphasised.

Persistent danger

Dr. Jameel underlined that though the number of cases in India were declining over the last three weeks, there was no room for complacency as the country was contributing nearly 24% of the global caseload as well as a similar fraction of deaths.

There were several collaborative studies underway in India looking at whether particular variants of the SARS CoV-2 virus were responsible for a higher death toll, but so far, there was no clinching link there were so, said Dr. Mayor.

39,2020/10/09,CVC lists over 50 cases of non-compliance of advice for disciplinary action,"Officials in question were posted with railways, AAI, DGCA, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, AIIMS-Delhi and some public sector banks.

The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has, in its annual report, listed over 50 instances in which the disciplinary authorities of various government agencies did not fully comply with its advice of proceedings and departmental action against the accused officials.

The officials in question were posted with agencies such as the railways, the Airport Authority of India (AAI), the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), AIIMS-Delhi and some public sector banks.

In one case, seven AAI officials were accused of extending undue favour to a private company by allowing it to use costly equipment of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines, lying in the AAI custody, for unlawful remuneration.

On June 3, 2019, the CVC advised major penalty proceedings against two officials and minor penalty proceedings against five. However, the disciplinary authority started minor penalty proceedings against two, while it issued advisory memo to four and displeasure memo to one official, who had retired, without referring their cases to the CVC for its second stage advice or reconsideration.

The annual report cites a case in which a Railway Chief Project Manager cancelled a tender in 2010 to allegedly favour an ineligible firm, which was subsequently awarded the work. The official was also accused of disbursing excessive compensation against the crops on an acquired land. However, against the advice of major penalty, the official was exonerated.

In another case, an Additional Divisional Railway Manager allegedly awarded a tender for “Solar Power Plant for Emergency Load at the DRM Office” to the sole bidder, ignoring that necessary papers were not submitted. The CVC advised major penalty proceedings, but the official was exonerated in January 2019 without seeking second-stage advice.

The report lists a case in which the CVC forwarded a complaint from an MP against the then DGCA Joint Director-General, for investigation and report to the Chief Vigilance Officer in the Ministry of Civil Aviation in June 2012.

False certificates

It was alleged that a captain working as an aviation academy pilot instructor issued false certificates to trainees leading to the grant of commercial pilot licences. The DGCA probed the matter and an FIR was filed. The official was also accused of approving the captain’s appointment as chief flying instructor for unlawful consideration.

In January 2019, the CVC conveyed its strong displeasure over an inordinate delay in furnishing the investigation report and the manner in which the case was dealt with by the Ministry. It also observed that proceedings in the criminal case had not yet been finalised.

The report states that timely action was not taken against a CBIC Additional Director, who faced the charge of deliberately misleading the Departmental Promotion Committee regarding qualification and experience of an employee, which led to his confirmation and regularisation of service. The official retired.

An ONGC official had allegedly kept enquiry reports, related to the action to be taken to ban two firms, with himself in 2013-15. The CVC advised major penalty but the disciplinary authority held that the charges did not hold.

Among the listed cases are those involving alleged irregularities by three BHEL-EML officials; a Director of a Central Research Institute under the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences; and some AIIMS-Delhi officials.

In an alleged case of illegal gratification, the CBI had sought sanction for prosecution and initiation of major penalty proceedings against one AICTE official. However, timely action was not taken and the official retired, according to the report.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uylpu1/article32815624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CVC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cvc-lists-over-50-cases-of-non-compliance-of-advice-for-disciplinary-action/article32815625.ece
40,2020/10/09,"Airlines owe ₹2,400 cr. to Airports Authority of India","The biggest defaulter among all is the Air India group, which owes more than 80% of the dues for using various airports

Various airlines have delayed their payments to the tune of ₹ 2,400 crore to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) because of the losses due to the fall in travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. The biggest defaulter among all is the Air India group, which owes more than 80% of the dues for using various airports.

The AAI has also declared SpiceJet and GoAir as “cash and carry airlines”, implying that they will need to pay their rentals daily to be able to use various airports.

According to official data, Air India owes ₹1,887 crore, Alliance Air ₹ 97 crore and Air India Express ₹12.55 crore.

Among the private carriers, IndiGo owes ₹ 150 crore, SpiceJet ₹ 140 crore, GoAir ₹ 58.75 crore, AirAsia India ₹ 21.61 crore and Vistara ₹ 2.79 crore. But the AAI says they have ensured that their dues do not exceed their bank guarantees.

Earnings from food and beverages hit

Apart from payments from airlines, COVID-19 has also impacted the AAI’s earnings from food and beverages and retain concessionaires at its airports as these have a revenue sharing model that has taken a hit because of the fall in passenger footfall, AAI chairman Arvind Singh said at a recent press conference. “The first two months of lockdown led to a revenue shortfall of 80% compared to the previous quarter. It has improved since then but hasn’t crossed the 50% mark”, he had explained.

These events have forced the AAI to take a loan of ₹1,500 crore from the State Bank of India for its working capital requirements and it is likely to go into the red for the financial year 2021, according to recent statement in Parliament.

The AAI has been a profitable entity for several years that pays a dividend to the government. In the financial year 2020, it earned a profit of over ₹3,600 crore over a revenue of around ₹14,367 crore.

The AAI expects some relief through an upfront payment by Adani Enterprises Limited as it is expected to take over three of the six airports awarded to it for operation, management and development by November 12.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/76u0y9/article32815514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRCRAFT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/airlines-owe-2400-cr-to-airport-authority-of-india/article32815515.ece
41,2020/10/09,NRI quota in professional courses is not sacrosanct: Supreme Court,"Candidates under the quota cannot assert their right to be admitted, says court in a judgment

Private colleges and institutions that offer professional and technical courses have a complete discretion to do away with their Non-Resident Indian (NRI) quota of seats after giving reasonable prior notice, the Supreme Court held on Friday.

NRI quota was not sacrosanct. Candidates under the quota cannot assert their right to be admitted, the court said in a judgment.

“Private colleges and institutions, which offer professional and technical courses, have some elbow room: They can decide whether, and to what extent, they wish to offer NRI or management quotas”, a Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat observed.

Change in seat matrix

The 28-page judgment came in an appeal against the change in seat matrix introduced in private medical and dental colleges in Rajasthan for post-graduate courses. The colleges could completely eliminate the NRI quota for 2020-21 academy year. The colleges argued in court that the NRI seats would not be filled during the pandemic. Besides, many NRI candidates have been considered for the management seats on the basis of merit.

The verdict referred to the seven-judge Bench decision in P.A. Inamdar, which held that 15% NRI quota was “not compulsory” but “only potential”.

“It was, and remains, within the discretionary authority of the management of private medical colleges, within their internal policy making domain”, Justice Bhat, who wrote the verdict, observed.

Sceptical about NRI quota

He said the apex court had consistently been sceptical about the NRI quota. That was why the court had suggested limiting the quota to 15%.

The judgment quoted from the Constitution Bench verdict in the Inamdar case, which said the term ‘NRI’ in relation to admissions was itself a “misnomer”.

“Neither the students who get admissions under this category nor their parents are NRIs. In effect and reality, under this category, less meritorious students, but who can afford to bring more money, get admission... The money brought by such students enables the educational institutions to strengthen its level of education and also to enlarge its educational activities”, the judgment quoted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r19uw0/article32523761.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-says-nri-quota-in-professional-technical-courses-not-sacrosanct/article32815363.ece
42,2020/10/09,"Narendra Modi’s idea of wind turbines for water impractical, say experts","Turbines convert wind energy into electricity; the blades are designed to actively keep moisture out

Can a wind turbine produce water out of thin air? Prime Minister Narendra Modi reckoned it is possible and requested Henrik Andersen, the CEO of Vesta Wind Systems, a Danish maker of wind turbines, if his organisation could develop the technology.

Mr. Modi’s reasoning was that the spinning turbine would be able to “suck out moisture” from the air and condense it into water. He further theorised that a turbine could go on to “separate” oxygen from the air, and thereby could produce oxygen, power and clean water.

Mr. Andersen said that Mr. Modi’s ideas conveyed “passion” that would keep his engineers “very busy”.

The remark was picked up by former Congress president Rahul Gandhi as an example of how none among the PM’s advisers were bold enough to point out how mistaken he was.

Experts that The Hindu reached out to said that moisture in turbines worked to the detriment of blades, and there were simpler alternatives to extracting water than from running a turbine.

A turbine converts wind energy into electricity and its blades are designed to actively keep moisture out. There have been attempts to harness wind energy for making potable water but this involves using electricity as a power source to purify saline water.

“Condensation is the enemy of the turbine,” said Amit Rambhia, managing director, Panache DigiLife Limited, a firm that works on technology applications. “A wind turbine at a coastal village, for instance, would benefit if there was a well to draw water from the ground, and have a turbine power a system to pump out or distil the water into fresh water.”

In response to Mr. Gandhi’s comment, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s IT cell Amit Malviya tweeted out articles to defend the PM’s conjecture and impugn Mr. Gandhi.

One pointed to a 2012 article in CNN that described a French company, Eole Water, which claimed to have modified a wind turbine to manufacture drinking water from air. The company, according to the article, displayed a working prototype of the 24-metre tall modified turbine in the desert near Abu Dhabi that has been able to produce 62 litres of water an hour. Company officials then said that it would cost $600,000-$790,000 to install a single such turbine. A check on the company’s website revealed that the company has exited the turbine business. It said: “Eole Water was a water technology company that pioneered the use of wind turbines to produce drinking water. The brand is no longer operational however their legacy lives on through improvements in water technology.”

An expert from a wind turbine manufacturing facility in Chennai told The Hindu on condition of anonymity that the PM’s suggestion is “implausible”. A turbine could be connected to a solar still — an old contraption used to distil water — to make it more efficient at distillation. The expert added, “Too much moisture would be corrosive, too little would make it inefficient for the purpose of trapping condensate. However, far more energy would be expended in extracting too little water. It’s a technology demonstrator but not something that can be realistically implemented anywhere.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dcd96k/article32815336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WINDTURBINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modis-idea-of-wind-turbines-for-water-impractical-say-experts/article32815337.ece

Ms. Chaturvedi mentioned that investigation by the Mumbai police uncovered 80,000 fake social media accounts that were used to target it over a film actor’s death.

Without mentioning the name of Sushant Singh Rajput, she quoted a study by the University of Michigan about how conspiracy theories about Rajput’s death were pushed through social media platforms.

“In the context of the suicide of an actor in Mumbai, numerous social media accounts were used to spread conspiracy theories and cast aspersions on the efficiency of the Mumbai police. 80,000 fake and illegitimate accounts were created with specific intent to malign the Maharashtra government and the Mumbai police force especially at a time when all efforts were directed to battle COVID-19,” she wrote.

Emphasising need to formulate appropriate guidelines to hold social media companies accountable, she said, “Currently, the legal framework under which these companies operate function on two pillars. One, these companies claim to be intermediaries under Indian law, meaning they are not liable for the content they provide a platform to. This ignores the use of algorithm that adds fuel to the fire...The second pillar is that these companies self regulate through community guidelines. This is meant to absolves the companies from any public oversight...”.

“When the Head of Facebook, Twitter can be called by the US Congress to answer questions and are being investigated in an open forum, then why is that the Indian government is even hesitating to ask them to explain their role in our nation”, she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/h793z0/article32815265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRIYANKACHATURVEDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shiv-sena-seeks-guidelines-for-social-media-platforms/article32815266.ece
45,2020/10/09,Ram Vilas Paswan makes final journey from 12 Janpath,"Union Minister’s remains taken to Patna; state funeral today

The mortal remains of Union Minister and Lok Janshakti Party patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan left 12 Janpath, his home for the last 31 years since 1989, amid slogans of “Goonje Dharti Aasmaan, Ram Vilas Paswan!”. The wooden casket on a truck decked with the white wreaths of flowers and huge posters of his smiling face, moved out on Friday afternoon amid crowds of supporters, party workers and family members.

Mr. Paswan’s body was taken to Patna in an IAF plane. From the airport it will be taken first to the Bihar Assembly and then to the LJP party office. The funeral will be held on Saturday.

At a specially convened meeting of the Union Cabinet earlier in the day, it was decided to accord Mr. Paswan a state funeral.

Mourners lined up outside the Lutyens bungalow from early in the morning, restlessly waiting for a glimpse of the Dalit leader as a series of dignitaries paid their last respects. President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were among the first to offer their condolences. Mr. Modi was accompanied by BJP president J.P. Nadda, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Animal Husbandry Minister Giriraj Singh.

Once the security restrictions lifted, serpentine queues formed inside the house waiting for a last glimpse. Among the opposition leaders NCP leader Sharad Pawar, RJD Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharati, CPI General Secretary D. Raja and AAP leader Sanjay Singh came to pay homage. Congress Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor was one of the early visitors.

Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi accompanied with party’s Bihar state in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil came in the afternoon. In 2014, Ram Vilas Paswan’s son and current LJP president Chirag Paswan had blamed Mr. Gandhi’s indifference towards them as one of the reasons for their shift from the UPA to the NDA.

In a condolence letter to Mr Chirag Paswan on Friday, Mr Gandhi wrote that in the death of Ram Vilas Paswan, the country has lost a veteran leader who left a lasting imprint on politics and public service both in Bihar and the nation.

By 1 p.m., the Rashtrapati Bhavan announced that the Railway Minister Piyush Goyal would handle additional charge of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution. Minutes after this announcement, Mr. Goyal reached 12 Janpath to offer his condolences.

By afternoon, the flow of visitors ebbed with marty workers standing around in groups recalling their last conversations with Mr. Paswan. His close associates recalled how till the very end, Mr Paswan did not lose his love for food. He wanted his chicken soup from the Press Club of India and craved sandwiches. He had first been admitted to Fortis Escorts Heart Institute for what he in a tweet had claimed was a “routine check up” more than a month back.

The LJP leader had undergone a heart surgery on Saturday night, after which he did not regain consciousness.

The final journey began a little after 3 p.m. As party workers shouted slogans, women workers broke into wails. His wife Reena broke down as Mr. Chirag Paswan helped her into the car.

He then walked through the jostling crowd to the flower-wreathed truck. Once on the truck he was also overcome by emotions, falling to his knees in tears beside the casket as the truck moved out on Mr Paswan’s last journey from 12 Janpath.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/areqsy/article32815096.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TH-PASWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ram-vilas-paswan-makes-final-journey-from-12-janpath/article32815097.ece
46,2020/10/09,"CBI books two HDIL promoters, ex-PMC Bank chief for ₹200 crore loan fraud","It says searches have been conducted on the premises of the accused at 10 locations in Mumbai

The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked two HDIL promoters, Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang, former PMC Bank chairman Waryam Singh, and seven others, on the charge of fraudulently taking loans of over ₹200 crore from Yes Bank.

“Searches have been conducted on the premises of the accused persons at 10 locations in Mumbai,” said a CBI official.

Funds diverted

It is alleged that the promoters and their associates got the loans sanctioned to Mack Star Marketing Private Limited. The funds were diverted to HDIL group entities for repayment of their loans to Yes Bank. The investors were not aware of the malpractice, said the FIR.

Mack Star is a joint venture of Mauritius-based Ocean Deity Investment Holdings Limited (ODIL) and certain privately held Indian companies owned and controlled by the Wadhawans. ODIL held 78.09% share capitals, while HDIL and Mr. Singh, a former chairman of PMC Bank, had the remaining shares, as alleged.

Office building

Mack Star developed an office building in Mumbai, using ₹1,000 crore, in February 2008. While ₹900 crore was used for buying the plot, the rest was spent on construction. The funds were mostly invested by ODIL. It is alleged that the Wadhawans, Mr. Singh and some other directors of HDIL group were appointed members of board of directors in Mack Star.

As the Wadhawans were experienced in developing and managing real estate projects in Mumbai, they along with certain directors appointed by them exercised full control over the day-to-day management and operations of Mack Star from 2008 to January 2019.

The accused persons got six loans amounting to ₹200.3 crore from Yes Bank during 2011-16 in the name of Mack Star without the approval or knowledge of investors. While ₹138 crore was credited to the current accounts of Mack Star, the remaining was directly transferred for the settlement of liabilities.

Also, ₹135 crore was transferred from the Yes Bank accounts of Mack Star to those of HDIL, Privilege Power and Infrastructure Private Limited and Sapphire Land Development Private Limited (all HDIL group entities), on the same dates of loan disbursements.

‘Collusion of auditor’

The FIR alleges collusion of the Mack Star’s statutory auditor, adding that the auditing firm’s two senior partners were close to the Wadhawans.

In January 2016, as alleged, the investors realised that the Wadhawans had taken loans fraudulently and they informed Yes Bank. However, the bank disbursed three instalments of loan amounting to ₹19.60 crore to Mack Star.

Three of the loans amounting to ₹140 crore were sanctioned to Mack Star to meet expenses on the modification, renovation and refurbishment of the newly constructed Mumbai property and for other capital requirements.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sbi6x0/article32814971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PROMOTERSHDIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-books-hdil-promoters-wadhawans-for-200-crore-loan-fraud-in-yes-bank-officials/article32814972.ece
47,2020/10/09,Nirav Modi’s remand extended for next extradition hearing on November 3,"At the next hearing, the court will be presented with arguments to determine the admissibility of the evidence provided by the Indian authorities.

Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi was on Friday further remanded in custody during a routine call-over hearing held via videolink at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London.

The 49-year-old jeweller, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, is expected to appear again via videolink from his prison in south-west London for the next scheduled hearing in his ongoing extradition trial on November 3.

I am adjourning the case for the next hearing on November 3 in the extradition case that has been part heard, said District Judge Karim Ezzat.

At the next hearing, the court will be presented with arguments to determine the admissibility of the evidence provided by the Indian authorities.

There is at least one further final hearing in the case, expected either in December or early next year, for closing submissions by both sides. A judgment in the case is expected only after the closing submissions.

Mr. Modi, meanwhile, remains at Wandsworth Prison, where he has been lodged since his arrest in March last year.

At a five-day hearing held last month, Justice Samuel Goozee presided over arguments for and against the case for his extradition brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED).

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, played videos in court in support of additional charges of Modi’s disruption of the CBI’s investigation by causing the disappearance of evidence and criminal intimidation of witnesses.

Assurances of adequate prison conditions were also provided by the Indian government, including additional commitments of appropriate mental health care for Modi on being extradited.

The defence team, led by barrister Clare Montgomery, sought to not only establish that Modi’s actions related to PNB-issued letters of undertaking (LoUs) did not amount to fraud but also deposed witnesses to highlight his fragile mental health condition and a high risk of suicide. The defence has claimed that the conditions at Barrack 12 in Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, where Modi is to be held on being extradited, do not meet the UK court’s human rights criteria.

48,2020/10/09,I&B ministry asks private satellite TV channels to adhere to Programme Code,"Attention is drawn to the provisions of the Programme Code as per which no programme should contain anything obscene, defamatory, deliberate, false and suggestive innuendos and half truths, an advisory said.

The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Friday asked all private satellite television channels to adhere to the Programme Code and emphasised that no programme should criticise, malign or slander any individual or certain groups.

The advisory comes in the wake of actor Rakul Preet Singh’s plea in the Delhi High Court alleging defamatory programmes being run against her in connection with a drugs probe related to the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.

In its advisory, the ministry said on various occasions in the past, it has issued advisories to private satellite TV channels to broadcast content strictly adhering to the Programme and Advertising Codes as prescribed under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and the rules framed thereunder.

Attention is drawn to the provisions of the Programme Code as per which no programme should contain anything obscene, defamatory, deliberate, false and suggestive innuendos and half truths, the advisory said.

As per the Code, no programme should criticise, malign or slander any individual in person or certain groups, segments of social, public and moral life of the country, the ministry said.

All private satellite TV channels are requested to ensure compliance with the directions above, it said.

49,2020/10/09,Country’s first indigenous anti-radiation missile successfully tested,"DRDO says it was launched from SU-30 MkI fighter aircraft

A New Generation Anti Radiation Missile (NGARM), RudraM-I, was successfully flight-tested on Friday by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). This is the first indigenous anti-radiation missile of the country.

An anti-radiation missile can locate and target any radiation emitting source like enemy radars, communication sites and other Radio Frequency (RF) emitting targets. They can play a key role in neutralising any jamming platforms of the enemy or take out radar stations thereby clearing a path for own fighters to carry out an offensive and also prevent own systems from being jammed.

Pinpoint accuracy

“The RudraM-I was successfully flight-tested onto a radiation target located on Wheeler Island off the coast of Odisha. The missile was launched from SU-30 MkI fighter aircraft,” the DRDO said in a statement. It hit the radiation target with pinpoint accuracy, it stated.

The missile after the launch, manoeuvred towards the target based on direction detected by the seeker and all mission objectives were successfully met, a defence source said. “It has a range of up to 200 km depending upon the launch conditions. The missile can be launched from altitudes of 500 m to 15 km and speeds of 0.6 to 2 mach,” the source added.

The missile, integrated with SU-30 MkI aircraft, has a capability of varying ranges based on the launch conditions. Having the Inertial Navigation System (INS)-Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation with Passive Homing Head (PHH) for the final attack, it is a potent weapon for the Indian Air Force for suppression of enemy air defence effectively from large stand-off ranges, the DRDO said.

The PHH can detect, classify and engage targets over a wide band of frequencies as programmed.

Launch procedure

Elaborating on the launch procedure, another source said that once the SU-30MKI approached the target, the launch processor in the launcher, the onboard computer and the passive seeker in the missile, worked in unison to display the required mission data to the pilot for action. “After completion of alignment of navigation system of the missile, the dynamic launch zone was displayed to the pilot,” the source said.

The PHH detected the target, and measured the direction of arrival of radiation and once the PHH seeker got a lock-on to the target (in lock-on before launch mode), the target was designated and the launch operation was performed by the pilot. Auto-launch was invoked and the missile was ejected using the catapult launcher, the source said.

The propulsion system ignited after ensuring safe separation from the launch platform, after which control and guidance algorithms in the onboard computer generated commands to correct the missile course. The seeker measurements were used to generate guidance commands to reach the target point, the source explained.

The NGARM is being developed by Defence Research Development Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad, as the nodal agency. It is a joint effort involving several DRDO labs, the IAF, the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and several public and private sector enterprises.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/21qz5t/article32814583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RUDRAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/countrys-first-indigenous-anti-radiation-missile-successfully-tested/article32814416.ece
50,2020/10/09,India gets second set of Swiss bank account details under automatic info exchange framework,"The information exchange this year involved nearly 3.1 million (31 lakh) financial accounts, FTA said in a statement on Friday

India has got the second set of Swiss bank account details of its nationals and entities under the automatic exchange of information pact with Switzerland, marking a key milestone in the government’s fight against black money allegedly stashed abroad.

India is among the 86 countries with which Switzerland’s Federal Tax Administration (FTA) has exchanged information on financial accounts within the framework of global standards on AEOI this year.

India had received the first set of details from Switzerland in September 2019 under AEOI (Automatic Exchange of Information), when it involved 75 countries.

The information exchange this year involved nearly 3.1 million (31 lakh) financial accounts, FTA said in a statement on Friday. The number of such accounts was similar in 2019.

While the statement did not explicitly name India among the 86 countries, officials told PTI that India is among the prominent countries with which Switzerland has shared details about financial accounts of clients of Swiss banks and various other financial institutions.

The officials further said a “sizeable number” relates to Indian citizens and entities in the overall exchange of information about over three million financial accounts by Switzerland this year with 86 countries.

Besides, Swiss authorities have already shared information about more than 100 Indian citizens and entities in the past one year on receipt of requests for administrative assistance in cases involving probes into financial wrongdoings including tax evasion, the officials added.

These cases mostly relate to older accounts that might have been closed before 2018, for which Switzerland has shared details with India under an earlier framework of mutual administrative assistance as Indian authorities had provided prima facie evidence of tax-related wrongdoing by those account holders. AEOI is applicable only to accounts that are active or were closed during 2018.

Some of these cases relate to entities set up by Indians in various overseas jurisdictions like Panama, British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands, while the individuals include mostly businessmen and a few politicians and erstwhile royals as well as their family members.

The officials, however, refused to share details about the exact number of accounts or the quantum of assets held in the accounts held by Indians, for which the information has been shared with India, citing strict confidentiality clauses governing the exchange framework.

The information shared by Swiss authorities include identification, account and financial information, such as name, address, country of residence and tax identification number, as well as information concerning the reporting financial institution, account balance and capital income.

The exchanged information will allow tax authorities to verify whether taxpayers have correctly declared their financial accounts in their tax returns. The next exchange would take place in September 2021.

In its statement, FTA said the 86 countries covered under the AEOI this year include 11 new jurisdictions -- Anguilla, Aruba, Bahamas, Bahrain, Grenada, Israel, Kuwait, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Panama and the United Arab Emirates -- in addition to the existing list of 75 countries, with whom information was shared last year.

Further, FTA said the exchange of information this year has been reciprocal with 66 countries. In the case of 20 countries, Switzerland received information but did not provide any, either because those countries do not yet meet the international requirements on confidentiality and data security (9 countries) or because they chose not to receive data (11 countries).

A total of 38 countries will supply their data to Switzerland in accordance with the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (Global Forum) by December 31, 2020. These countries have claimed technical difficulties due to the COVID-19 crisis.

Switzerland’s first such exchange took place at the end of September 2018 and involved 36 countries, but India did not figure in the list at that time.

Currently, around 8,500 reporting financial institutions (banks, trusts, insurers, etc) are registered with FTA. These institutions collected the data and transferred it to FTA. The count has increased from about 7,500 last year.

fta sent information on around 3.1 million financial accounts to the partner states and received information on around 8,15,000 financial accounts from them.

fta also said it cannot provide any information on the amount of financial assets.

switzerland has committed itself to adopting the global standard for the international automatic exchange of information in tax matters. the legal basis for the implementation of aeoi in switzerland came into force on january 1, 2017.

this is the second time that india has received details from swiss authorities under aeoi framework, which provides for the exchange of information on financial accounts, currently active as well as those accounts that were closed during 2018, the year in which the framework agreement became effective.

However, AEOI only relates to accounts that are officially in the name of Indians and they might include those used for business and other genuine purposes.

The Global Forum of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reviews AEOI implementation.

According to experts, the data received by India can be quite useful for establishing a strong prosecution case against those who have any unaccounted wealth, as it provides entire details of deposits and transfers as well as of all earnings, including through investments in securities and other assets.

On condition of anonymity, several officials said the details relate mostly to businessmen, including non-resident Indians now settled in several South-East Asian countries as well as in the US, the UK and even some African and South American countries.

A Swiss delegation was in India in August last year before the first set of details could get shared and the two sides also discussed possible steps to expedite the execution of tax information-sharing requests made by India in specific cases.

It is feared many Indians might have closed their accounts after a global crackdown on black money led to Switzerland buckling under international pressure to open its banking sector for scrutiny to clear the long-held perception of Swiss banks being safe haven for undisclosed funds.

Switzerland agreed to AEOI with India after a long process, including a review of the necessary legal framework in India on data protection and confidentiality.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xsz2fq/article32814115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-Blackmoney,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-gets-second-set-of-swiss-bank-account-details-under-automatic-info-exchange-framework/article32814116.ece

The Supreme Court on Friday allowed several Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) aspirants who have complaints about the exam to approach the Grievance Redressal Committee headed by a former Chief Justice of India within the next three days.

“We are of the view that ends of justice be served in giving liberty to the petitioners to submit a representation to the Grievance Redressal Committee with regard to their grievance within three days from today. We order accordingly. We have no doubt that the petitioners’ representation will be considered by the committee at an early date”, a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan recorded in its order.

The court did not, meanwhile, interfere or stay the counselling or admission process. It said counselling had started and a large number of candidates have completed theirs.

The petitioner-aspirants, represented by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, alleged that the CLAT and evaluation was “erroneous, faulty, defective, discriminatory and violative of fundamental rights of the Constitution”.

The petition had been filed by several students from across the country led by Uttar Pradesh-based Lavanya Bhatt. They urged the apex court to quash the exam and order it to be re-conducted.

Plea for panel

The plea further asked the court to direct the consortium to set up a high-powered committee to examine the numerous complaints about “software glitches” and mismatched questions and answers so that students are not put in a dilemma. The petition said a foolproof mechanism should be built to avoid these problems in the future.

The online CLAT 2020 was conducted on September 28. The complaints about the exam included results displaying answers different from the ones ticked; results displaying or calculating marks for questions that were not even attempted by the candidates; 10 wrong questions followed by erroneous answers, etc.

The petition also complained about the “unreasonable lengthy design of the CLAT examination”.

Over 75,000 candidates had applied for CLAT, while 68,833 downloaded the admit cards.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also paid his last tributes to the departed leader and visited the latter’s place.

Gandhi said Paswan raised voice for the most marginalised sections in society and left a lasting imprint on politics and public service in both Bihar and the country.

In a letter to Chirag Paswan, son of the late Union Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh described him as an important Dalit face in the central government.

“In his death our country has lost one of its greatest Dalit and socialist leaders, who always stood for the cause of the poor and downtrodden people of the society,” Dr. Singh said in his condolences.

“Ram Vilas Paswan ji was a very important Dalit face in the central government, of many parties. I have very warm recollections of my association with Shri Paswan ji as a member of the UPA Government which I led in 2004.

“The veteran socialist leader, Paswan ji was also a very efficient administrator who worked very closely with me as Minister of Chemicals and Fertilisers, and also served as minister in various ministries,” the former PM said.

Dr. Singh said Paswan was a mass leader which is evident from the fact that he won Parliament elections with a record majority from his constituency.

He said Paswan was also a leader who was loved and respected by all with whom he came into contact with, irrespective of their political leniency.

Mr. Gandhi, in a letter to Chirag Paswan, said he was deeply saddened by the sudden demise of his father.

“We have lost a veteran leader who left a lasting imprint on politics and public service in both Bihar and our nation.

“In an illustrious public life spanning over five decades, he was the voice of the most marginalised sections of our society and defended the rights of the poor and the vulnerable,” he said in his letter.

Mr. Gandhi said as a Member of Parliament and Union Minister, Paswan voiced the interests and concerns of the poor with passion.

55,2020/10/09,Supreme Court questions NCPCR on children ‘repatriation’,"Child rights body has requested 8 States to “produce” children living in care homes before local child welfare committees for their ‘immediate repatriation’ with their families

The Supreme Court on Friday sought a response from the country’s apex child rights body, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), to its request to eight States to “produce” children living in care homes before the local child welfare committees for their “immediate repatriation” with their families.

The NCPCR reportedly wrote to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Mizoram, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Meghalaya in this regard. These States combinedly have 1.84 lakh children in care homes. This accounts for over 70% of the children in care homes.

A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao asked the NCPCR to respond why such repatriation of the children to their families should not be done on an individual basis. The next hearing is on November 24.

The court is suo motu monitoring the condition and welfare of children places in care homes across the country during the pandemic.

The NCPCR, in a letter on September 24, explained need for a child to grow up in a familial environment. In an April 6 order, the court had directed juvenile authorities to “proactively consider whether a child or children should be kept in the child care institutions considering the best interest, health and safety concerns”.

However, on Friday, the court wondered whether the NCPCR could issue such general directions to the States without considering the education, health, safety of the children, the consent of their parents and their economical situation.

Amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal said the NCPCR direction violated the Juvenile Justice Act of 2015. Besides, He argued that the pandemic would make a child more vulnerable to domestic abuse. His note in the Supreme Court mentions the NCPCR letter to Karnataka in this regard.

On individual basis

Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati agreed that repatriation ought to be considered on an individual basis.

Additional Advocate General of Tamil Nadu Balaji Srinivasan placed on record a note from the S. Madumathi, Secretary, Social Welfare Department, that a total of 43,083 children have been temporarily placed with their families. Mr. Srinivasan submitted that the department had been keeping tabs on them after the relaxation of the lockdown.

“The children being taken in child care homes, are not only those who are orphans/abandoned children, but also children hailing from downtrodden/financially unstable families. Therefore, if there is any child who is either being brought up by a single parent or comes from a family which is not able to bring up the child properly, then that child can avail all the facilities at a care home. All the children in these care homes are required to study in nearby government schools”, the note said.

“This year, the government has allotted ₹949 crore for providing laptops to children. From the year 2011 till 2020, State Government has spent ₹7,268 crore”, it stated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/y7ctxm/article32815721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-NCPCR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-questions-ncpcr-on-children-repatriation/article32812837.ece
56,2020/10/09,Oil India resumes Andaman offshore survey after almost 3 decades,"ONGC had drilled six wells off the islands in 2013-14 without commercial success

Battling blowout at a natural gas well near its “home” in eastern Assam, Oil India Limited (OIL) has resumed its operations off the Andaman Islands after almost three decades.

OIL, headquartered in Dibrugarh district’s Duliajan, last handled any exploration and production activity off the islands in the Bay of Bengal in the 1980s. The public sector ‘Navaratna’ company resumed its seismic survey in its Andaman offshore blocks on October 8.

Seismic survey usually precedes all oil and gas exploration activity.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, India’s largest exploration company, had drilled six wells off the Andaman shores during the 2013-14 fiscal without commercial success or production.

“After 2014, we are the only company to venture into the Andaman waters for exploration activities. But while ONGC were in deep waters, we are getting into shallow waters with a sophisticated multipurpose data acquisition vessel,” an OIL spokesperson said.

He added that oil exploration “will be in logistically and geologically-challenging areas” as most of the prolific category A areas have been explored.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas had awarded 32 blocks under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) through two rounds of bidding in January and February, 2019. OIL won bids for 12 blocks, including two covering an area of 9,616.7 sq km in shallow waters off the shores of Andaman Islands.

“We have drawn up plans to intensify our exploration efforts in the country and increase exploration capital expenditures in the coming years,” OIL Chairman and Managing Director Sushil Chandra Mishra said.

Among the projects is data acquisition in Mahanadi on-land blocks in Odisha that would be started soon, followed by exploration drilling campaign in its OALP blocks from the 2021-22 fiscal.

OIL expects to drill 66 wells across its OALP blocks within the next four years, officials said.

Killing operation on

For OIL, the efforts to “kill” the blowout well at Baghjan in Tinsukia district continue. ‘Killing’ means injecting a viscous cement fluid into the affected well at great speed in order to prevent natural gas from coming out.

On September 13, foreign and OIL’s experts tamed the flame atop Well No. 5 by diverting the gas outflow to flare pits. The well had a blowout on May 27 and burst into flames on June 9.

The gas diversion technique is temporary.

OIL has also been in a legal tangle over the permission it was granted to drill for oil and natural gas in the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park close to the Baghjan blowout well. On May 11, the Centre gave OIL environmental clearance for extended drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations within the 340 sq km park, a biosphere reserve known for its feral horses and avifauna.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his suggestion that wind turbines can be used to generate clean drinking water, oxygen and energy, evoking sharp reactions from BJP leaders who said he needs to read scientific papers.

“The real danger to India isn’t that our PM doesn’t understand. It’s the fact that nobody around him has the guts to tell him,” he said on Twitter, as he posted a video of the Prime Minister’s interaction with a CEO of a wind energy company.

The Prime Minister is heard suggesting the CEO make use of wind turbines to produce not just energy but also oxygen and clean drinking water from thin air.

Hitting back at Mr. Gandhi, Union Minister Piyush Goyal said, “Nobody around Rahul Gandhi has the guts to tell him that he doesn’t understand. He mocks PM Narendra Modi’s ideas when the CEO of the world’s leading company endorses them.”

He also tagged a news report with his tweet that says wind turbines create water from thin air.

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also attacked Mr. Gandhi in a tweet, saying, “Rahul ji tomorrow morning please get up at night and read the two scientific papers that I have attached herewith. Though I’m sure you won’t understand the complexity of the subject...”

He also attached news reports that said wind turbines create water from thin air and another saying wind turbine makes 1000 litres of clean water a day in the desert.

BJP’s head of social media department Amit Malviya also attacked Mr. Gandhi.

“There is no cure for ignorance and entitlement. Entitled brat Rahul thinks everyone around the world is as clueless as he is... He mocks PM’s ideas when CEO of world’s leading wind energy company terms them inspirational! Watch the last bit of the video he himself has posted...,” he said in a tweet.

The third edition of the two-plus-two dialogue between India and the US is expected to take place on October 26 and 27 here during which both sides are likely to carry out a comprehensive review of their strategic cooperation, people familiar with the development said on Thursday.

The new framework of the ministerial dialogue was initiated in order to provide a forward-looking vision for the strategic partnership between the two countries.

In the third edition of talks, both sides are also expected to delve into the situation in the Indo-Pacific region as well as in India’s neighbourhood besides key bilateral issues.

Mr. Kappan was arrested along with three others while he was on his way to cover the Hathras case and has been booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

“Freedom of press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy and the arrest of a reputed senior journalist like Mr. Kappan on terror charges is a direct attack on this freedom. The reporting of such incidents and presenting the truth to the public is an essential part of a journalist’s work and these attempts to silence their voice is to be unequivocally condemned,” Mr. Viswam wrote.

62,2020/10/09,Supreme Court allows accused in Payal Tadvi case to return to college,"The Supreme Court has allowed the three doctors accused of abetting the suicide of Dr. Payal Tadvi to re-enter their medical college and resume post-graduate courses, subject to certain conditions.

“They must be allowed to go back to their courses of study, otherwise the pendency of prosecution against them will add further penalty in the form of prejudicing their career. Any such adverse impact will negate their rights under Article 21 of the Constitution,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit observed in a judgment on Thursday.

The verdict came on an appeal filed by the accused — Ankita Kailash Khandelwal, Hema Suresh Ahuja and Bhakti Arvind Mehare — against a February 20 order of the Bombay High Court. The High Court had granted them bail but imposed conditions, including that they should not re-enter the college from which they were suspended by the Dean a few days before their arrest.

Ms. Tadvi took her own life on May 22 last year. Her mother filed a complaint against the trio, alleging that they harassed her daughter, their junior in college. She accused them of being directly responsible for her daughter's death. The police registered a case of abetting suicide and under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the anti-ragging law. A 1200-page chargesheet was filed.

The court observed that their suspension was based purely on the fact of the registration of the crime. It had no statutory basis.

Besides, the accused had to train under the same guide in the same institution where they were registered, the court reasoned.

The judgment contained several conditions. Among others, the accused should not attempt to influence any witnesses, they shall be present in court on trial dates, they may not reside in the residents' quarters of the college hospital, unless their registration allows them to do so, and they shall avail themselves of study leave/vacation to reduce their presence in the campus as much as possible.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over a news report that claimed there has been a delay in the procurement of clothing and other essential equipment required for soldiers posted in the high altitudes of Siachen-Ladakh.

Taking to Twitter, Mr. Gandhi did the math on what the government of India could have purchased for soldiers with the ₹8,400 crore that it spent in acquiring a special aircraft meant for the Prime Minister and others dignitaries.

His tweet was in response to a news report in a Hindi newspaper that claimed the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament has sought permission from the Lok Sabha Speaker to visit Ladakh for an assessment on the ground after a Comptroller and Auditor General report flagged delays in the procurement of essential items for soldiers.

“The Prime Minister spent Rs 8,400 crore to acquire an air plane. For our soldiers posted in Siachen-Ladakh, this amount could have bought: Warm Clothing: 30,00,000, Jackets and gloves: 60,00,000, Shoes: 67,20,000, Oxygen Cylinders: 16,80,000. PM is only concerned about his image and not soldiers,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted.

Janata Dal (United) leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s “demeaning” behaviour towards Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan during the Rajya Sabha elections was one of the key reasons for the LJP to raise a flag of rebellion against him.

LJP president Chirag Paswan, in a six-page letter to BJP president J.P. Nadda on September 24, 10 days prior to formal decision by his party to go solo, had explained his party’s position.

At a joint press conference by the BJP and the JD(U) to announce the NDA’s seat sharing arrangement, Mr. Kumar, answering a question on the political battle with the LJP, had said, “Could Ram Vilas Paswan get his Rajya Sabha seat without the assistance of JD(U)? Could they have managed a Rajya Sabha seat on the basis of their two MLAs? It was only because of the assistance of BJP and JD(U) [that Ram Vilas Paswan could get an RS seat].”

In the 2015 Assembly elections, the LJP fought 42 seats but managed to win only two with less than five per cent vote share.

In his letter, Mr. Chirag Paswan said his father Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan was mistreated by Mr. Kumar. During the discussion on seat distribution ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, in which then BJP president Amit Shah, Mr. Kumar, Mr. Chirag Paswan along with his father were present, it was decided that the LJP will get six Lok Sabha seats and one Rajya Sabha seat. But just before the nomination process began, Mr. Chirag Paswan said the Bihar Chief Minister changed tack and refused to support Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan’s nomination claiming that he was not told about any such arrangement.

Mr. Chirag Paswan goes on to say in the letter that his father was forced to go to the Chief Minister’s residence to seek his support despite prior agreement. Mr. Kumar did not behave appropriately with Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan when he went to visit him. The Bihar Chief Minister, Mr. Chirag Paswan said, snubbed his father and despite many requests did not go to the Assembly to file the nomination papers with him. Mr. Kumar did come to the Assembly, but in his own car and after the scheduled time.

Mr. Chirag Paswan said Mr. Kumar’s subsequent statements about his father were equally dismissive, including claiming ignorance about Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan’s ill health while Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been in constant touch with him to enquire about his father.",,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/3k83hj/article32379522.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIHARKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nitish-mistreated-my-father-chirag-paswan-tells-nadda/article32808412.ece

Although the NIA did not come up with any official statement, activists known to Mr. Swamy said the veteran activist was picked up by NIA personnel.

Anticipating the NIA action, the activist had released a statement on October 6, saying, “I was interrogated by NIA for 15 hours during a span of 5 days [July 27, 28, 29 and 30 and August 6].”

“Apart from my bio-data and some factual information, several extracts allegedly taken from computer implicating my connection to Maoist forces were placed before me. I told them all these were fabrications stealthily put into my computer and I disowned them,” he said.

“The nature of the present NIA investigation of me has nothing to do about Bhima Koregaon case in which I have been booked as a suspected accused and consequently raided twice [August 28, 2018 and June 12, 2019],” Mr. Swamy stated.

“But it had everything to do to somehow establish that I am personally linked to extremist leftist forces and through me Bagaicha [his residential campus] is also relating to some Maoists. I denied both these allegations in strongest terms,” he said.

After six weeks of silence, the activist said, he was summoned to appear in NIA office in Mumbai.

“I have informed them that I fail to understand the need for interrogating me further given the fact I have been subjected to that for 15 hours already. I am not in a position to undertake the long journey given my age and the nature of the epidemic ravaging the country,” Mr. Swamy said.

He wanted further interrogation through video-conferencing given the Jharkhand government’s directive that during the lockdown period elderly persons above the age of 60 should not appear in public.

68,2020/10/09,Secret legal matter holding up Vijay Mallya’s extradition: U.K.,"India has been pressing the U.K. to extradite Mallya after he lost his appeals in the British Supreme Court in May against his extradition to face money laundering and fraud charges.

The U.K. has conveyed to India that fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya cannot be extradited till the resolution of a “secret legal” matter, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Thursday.

India has been pressing the U.K. to extradite Mallya after he lost his appeals in the British Supreme Court in May against his extradition to face money laundering and fraud charges.

“Now, we have been told that there is a secret legal matter and that his extradition cannot take place without its resolution... We are in touch with the U.K. government,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at a media briefing.

He said New Delhi has been in constant touch with the U.K. government after Mallya exhausted all legal remedies. The U.K. top court’s decision marked a major setback to the 64-year-old businessman as it came weeks after he lost his high court appeal in April against an extradition order to India.

In June, India urged the U.K. not to consider any request for asylum by Mallya as there appeared to be no ground for his persecution in the country.

The U.K. government had indicated that Mallya is unlikely to be extradited to India anytime soon, saying there is a legal issue that needed to be resolved before his extradition can be arranged.

Mallya has been based in the U.K. since March 2016 and remains on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017.

The High Court verdict in April upheld the 2018 ruling by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot at the end of a year-long extradition trial in December 2018 that the former Kingfisher Airlines boss had a “case to answer” in the Indian courts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cmajr/article32453311.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAIN-INDIAMALLYATHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/secret-legal-matter-holding-up-vijay-mallyas-extradition-uk/article32807665.ece

70,2020/10/09,‘Jagan mama’ portraying Telugu in poor light: Thulasi Reddy,"‘Most of the Nobel laureates pursued education in their mother tongue’

APCC working president N. Thulasi Reddy on Friday warned Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy against committing a “historical blunder” by replacing Telugu with English as the medium of instruction in the government schools in the State.

In a statement, Mr. Thulasi Reddy ridiculed Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy for calling himself “mama” (maternal uncle) of the schoolchildren at a programme organised to launch the Jagananna Vidya Kanuka scheme on Thursday.

Referring to the Chief Minister’s claims that he would help the children progress in life by making them proficient in English language, Mr. Thulasi Reddy said, “Jagan mama is showing Telugu language in a poor light, and portraying it as inferior to English.”

The Congress leader said that 98% of the Nobel laureates had pursued education in their mother tongue. Great people such as Mahatma Gandhi, poet Rabindranath Tagore, architect of Indian Constitution B.R. Ambedkar and former President Abdul Kalam were proponents of the use of mother tongue as the medium of instruction in primary education, Mr. Thulasi Reddy said.

He said the Chief Minister should not spoil the future of the children and allow them to pursue their primary education in Telugu medium.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-mama-portraying-telugu-in-poor-light-thulasi-reddy/article32816714.ece
71,2020/10/09,JC terms Jagan’s rule dictatorial,"‘Government foisting false cases against my family members’

After a long spell of silence, former Anantapur MP and TDP leader J.C. Diwakar Reddy on Friday hit out at the YSRCP, terming the rule of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy as dictatorial, while preparing for an agitation against the government’s denial of permission for limestone quarries.

Limestone quarry

Mr. Diwakar Reddy, who had come to the office of Assistant Director of Mines at Tadipatri, questioned as to why his family members’ application for sanction of permission for limestone quarry was not being given and why was a Vigilance inquiry ordered instead.

“The Y.S. Jagan government is using the government officers to harm our family by foisting false cases. The SC/ST cases against my brother and his son are an example. The officers need to understand that for fear of transfer, they should not act against my family with vengeance,” Mr. Diwakar Reddy said.

In his inimitable style, he quipped, “I do not know why the government and officials have shown sympathy on me and spared me alone, while targeting my family members.”

When the Assistant Director was not there in office, Mr. Diwakar Reddy threatened to launch an indefinite hunger strike if permissions were not granted to his family members.

74,2020/10/09,FCV tobacco growers oppose move to broaden the scope of CTRI,"‘It may result in lack of focus on tobacco-related research’

Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) Tobacco Growers and Traders’ Associations have opposed the proposal to broaden the research work of the Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) in Rajahmundry, which has been hand-holding the farmers in implementing the the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) in the cultivation of FCV tobacco.

A proposal of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to widen the scope of the CTRI to other commercial crops and even change the nomenclature of the institute as the Indian Institute of Research on Commercial Agriculture (IIRCA) is a cause for concern for the FCV tobacco farming community.

Memorandum to Nirmala

A group of farmers belonging to the Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA), the Virginia Tobacco Growers’ Association (VTGA), the Kaligiri FCV Tobacco Growers’ Association, and the traders represented by the Indian Tobacco Association met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her visit to Vijayawada recently and submitted her a memorandum. The Union Minister reportedly assured the delegation that she would look into the issue.

The ICAR-CTRI was established in Rajahmundry in 1947, and is one of the oldest research institutions functioning under the ICAR, New Delhi. Its mandate is to conduct basic, strategic, and applied research on different tobaccos grown in India. It has done a tremendous work by developing a number of improved varieties.

“The CTRI has also helped the farmers by introducing several eco-friendly technologies for improving the efficiency of tobacco production and the lives of small and marginal farmers. The CTRI is the only government R&D institute supporting the farming community through research and guiding the farmers to opt for good agricultural practices. We urge the Centre to stop the proposal to widen the scope of the institute, which may result in lack of focus on tobacco-related research and support the farming community in A.P. and Karnataka,” said CH. Yashwanth, national spokesperson, FAIFA.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/fcv-tobacco-growers-oppose-move-to-broaden-the-scope-of-ctri/article32816669.ece
75,2020/10/09,100 LED screens to show Sirimanotsavam live across Vizianagaram,"People not to be allowed near temple, curbs on buses and other vehicles

The historic Sirimanotsavam of Sri Pyditalli Ammavari temple here is going to be a low-key affair this time with restrictions on movement of devotees on the festival day on October 27, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic that has already created a havoc in Vizianagaram and many parts of the district.

Normally around three lakh people participate in the utsavam when the Sirimanu would move three times from Sri Pyditalli Ammavari temple and the fort of Pusapati Gajapathi families. Taking a cue from the recent Puri Jagannath utsavam and Sri Venkateswara temple Brahmotsavam at Tirumala, the Andhra Pradesh government has come out with many guidelines for conducting the festival without breaking local traditions and customs.

After taking the opinion of political leaders and representatives of various non-governmental organisations in the Collector’s office here on Friday, Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana urged people not to attend the Sirimanotsavam directly since it might to lead to spread of coronavirus in the absence of social distance.

Shops to be closed

“We will set up nearly 100 LED screens in the entire city to enable devotees to watch Sirimanotsavam from their respective streets. Also, women devotees who carry Ammavari ghatams should not come to the temple with their family members and relatives. All the shops and establishments will have to be closed on the day. We will also restrict movement of buses and other vehicles to prevent people coming from other places,” he said.

MLA Kolagatla Veerabhadra Swamy urged people to have darshan of Goddess Pyditalli now onwards instead of waiting till the day of Sirimanotsavam.

MP Bellana Chandrasekhar and YSRCP district political coordinator Majji Srinivasa Rao urged citizens not to invite their relatives and friends for the festival this year.

83,2020/10/09,MANSAS in crisis as Pusapati families at loggerheads,"Over 1,500 employees working in various institutions run by the trust are a worried lot

Row over MANSAS Trust among the Pusapati family members has proved to be a bane for more than 1,500 employees, including those of outsourcing, working in Maharaja College of Vizianagaram and other educational institutions. MANSAS, one of the India’s richest trust with properties worth ₹50,000 crore in North Andhra and several other places, is now unable to pay salaries to the staff.

A reported move to privatise the MR College, which was established in 1879, shocked its teaching and non- teaching staff. It turns into a major controversy as almost all families in Vizianagaram have an emotional attachment with the college which produced many eminent personalities like Gurajada Apparao, Gidugu Venkataramamurthy, and Chaganti Somayajulu.

Activities of the trust were smooth till 2019. Former Minister P. Ananda Gajapati Raju’s younger brother and former Union Minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju was the chairperson till Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju was made as head of the institution six months ago. Ms. Sanchaita is the daughter of Uma Gajapathi Raju who got divorced from Ananda Gajapati Raju three decades ago.

Mr. Ashok Gajapati Raju has challenged her appointment in AP High Court. Meanwhile, Anand Gajapati Raju’s second wife Sudha Gajapathi Raju and her daughter Urmila Gajapathi Raju also claimed their right over the trust.

According to sources, the three families have differences. Ms. Sudha Gajapathi’s family members have grouse against Mr. Ashok Gajapati Raju as they were kept away from MANSAS affairs after the death of Ananda Gajapathi Raju. They also oppose Ms. Sanchaiata’s claims saying that her mother had taken divorce long ago and she cannot be the chairperson of the trust. The internal bickering has an impact on the maintenance of 12 educational institutions, including MR College, where more than 10,000 students are pursuing various courses.

Proposal opposed

“Professors, lecturers and employees lament they become scapegoats with the internal fight among the three families. The government should cancel privatisation proposal since MR College is the lone aided institution helping many youngsters to get higher education at affordable fee structures,” said Reddi Sankara Rao, secretary of Pattana Powra Samskshema Sangham, a civic society of Vizianagaram.

Aam Aadmi Party Vizianagaram district convener K. Dayanand said that the employees were unable to get salaries for the last three months although MR College had funds to the tune of ₹120 crore in banks.

“Privatisation would lead to huge fee structure in future. The government should intervene and ensure free education for all students,” he added. Students Federation of India district president Ch. Venkatesh and secretary P. Rammohan and others have been holding agitations for the last one week for the protection of MR College.

“Announcement of zero year for 2020-21 is a big shock for the students. It is a step towards privatisation. We will strongly oppose the move,” said Mr. Venkatesh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ojjl0e/article32809734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09ONGCOLLEGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mansas-in-crisis-as-pusapati-families-at-loggerheads/article32809735.ece

86,2020/10/09,"COVID-19: 93% 2,697 patients who died in August were symptomatic","In Chamarajanagar, Uttara Kannada, and Yadgir 50% were asymptomatic

Of 2,697 patients, who succumbed to COVID-19 during August in Karnataka, 93% were symptomatic. While 38% had only breathlessness as a symptom, 37% had breathlessness and other symptoms, such as cough and fever. However, in Chamarajanagar, Uttara Kannada, and Yadgir districts, 50% of the deceased were asymptomatic.

The youngest patient who died due to COVID during August was a four-month-old baby in Hassan (Patient No. 2367890), who was recorded as a patient with co-morbidities (diabetes and hypertension).

The oldest were three 96-year-old patients (2 males and 1 female) from Shivamogga, Mandya, and Uttara Kannada.

According to an analysis by Project Jeevan Raksha, a public-private initiative involving Public Health Foundation of India, the Indian Medical Association, and Proxima, a management consulting firm, 94% of the deceased had breathlessness as a symptom.

Over 90% of the deceased in eight of the 30 districts had Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI). In Bagalkot district, all those who died during August had breathlessness, cough, and fever, while 44% from Mandya had only cough. While 67.5% of the deceased had SARI, 17% had Influenza Like-Illness (ILI). The source of infection could not be traced in 15%.

Making a presentation on the analysis on Friday, Mysore Sanjeev, convener of Project Jeevan Raksha, said a key observation was that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients have a relatively lower risk of death when compared to symptomatic patients.

Co-morbidities

One-third (33.33%) of the 2,697 victims had no co-morbidities. All those who died in Kodagu district and 89% of the deaths from Yadgir district had no co-morbidities.

Among those who had co-morbidities, 47% of the victims were diabetic and 21% had both diabetes and hypertension.

“While 55% of the victims in Raichur district had hypertension alone, nearly 1/4th of those in Bengaluru Urban had both diabetes and hypertension. Those with diabetes and/or hypertension are at high risk,” he said.

Apart from the four-month-old baby, a 11-year-old boy who had hypertension also succumbed to the virus in Dakshina Kannada.

Asserting that these deaths should be investigated, Mr. Sanjeev said: “There are two critical issues here: accuracy of the diagnosis and competence of the doctors who treated these children. While the baby died in a government hospital, the boy passed away in a private hospital. We need to find out if they were given appropriate treatment.”

Brought dead

While 3% of the victims were brought dead to the hospital, 1.1% died in their residence. While 17% died on the same day of their admission to the hospital, 51% died within 100 hours of admission to the hospital. Nearly 45% of the deaths occurred in COVID-19 Designated Hospitals (DCHs) and 27% died in private hospitals. The place of death has not been disclosed for 25.4% of the victims in August.

Although, 3,425 patients died in August, only 2,697 deaths were analysed as the details of all patients were not made available on the Health Department’s website,",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/g1nbv6/article32816768.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BW-th23Karnataka-map-bw,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-93-of-covid-19-victims-in-august-were-symptomatic/article32816769.ece

95,2020/10/09,Dasara | COVID-19 State advisory panel visits Mysuru,"Committee members visit Chamundi Hills and palace; decision soon on scale of celebrations

The COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee was in Mysuru on Friday after the State government sought its expert opinion on how to conduct the ensuing Dasara festivities amidst the pandemic. The committee’s views were sought after concerns were expressed over the reported move to relax the curbs for allowing public participation and cultural events at the palace.

Minister for Health and Family Welfare B. Sriramulu had said here recently that the government would take a final call on the festivities – on whether to allow a small gathering and conduct any events – based on the technical committee’s report.

The committee headed by Dr. Sudarshan, which arrived here from Bengaluru, had a brief interaction with Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri on the COVID-19 situation and later proceeded to the venues of festivities – Chamundi Hills (inauguration venue) and the Mysuru palace (the venue of Jamboo Savari on the final day) – and interacted with the authorities there.

The committee members went to Sri Chamundeshwari Temple atop Chamundi Hills. The temple chief priest Shashi Shekhar Dixit accompanied the members who went around the temple complex and also saw the place where the Dasara inauguration usually takes place adjoining the temple complex. Mr. Dixit explained the rituals and other details that are part of the inauguration.

The officials of the Palace Board briefed the committee at the palace on the Jamboo Savari, which will be limited to the palace environs as part of low-key celebrations, and the seating arrangements that are usually made at the palace during the finale for the public to watch the proceedings.

The committee is expected to submit its report to the government and the Health Ministry on its observations and opinion considering the pandemic situation.

When Minister for Medical Education K. Sudhakar was in Mysuru recently, he cited the example of Kerala where the cases surged after it relaxed restrictions on account of Onam festival. “We need to keep in mind what happened in Kerala before a decision is taken on allowing the events and gathering at the Dasara,” he said.

The question before the government is whether to conduct the festivities in a simple manner and whether to allow the public to participate, after concerns were expressed from various quarters, including some BJP’s elected representatives, on relaxing the curbs on gatherings. The city is readying for the celebrations with the major streets and circles now equipped with lights for Dasara illumination.

The committee opined that the COVID-19 situation before and after Onam needs to be pondered and a decision taken accordingly.

97,2020/10/09,The man who changed the course of the Periyar,"Mullaperiyar dam, constructed by John Pennycuik, turns 125 today

As one travels to Cumbom valley west of the Western Ghats, there is a statue of John Pennycuik at lower Periyar in addition to many other memorials to him. On his birthday and during the sowing season, many pay floral tributes at the memorials.

It was Pennycuik who changed the course of the Periyar - diverting the west-flowing river to the east water-starved fields of Cumbom valley, now dotted with paddy fields, vineyards, vegetable and coconut plantations, and flower gardens.

The Mullaperiyar dam turns 125 on Saturday and the British engineer tasked by the Madras presidency for its construction is worshipped as a hero by farmers in the four districts of southern Tamil Nadu, where water from the dam meets the drinking water needs and irrigates thousands of hectares.

Details of the dam construction are available in official British documents, Madurai Manual (AD 1800s) and reports of the Reuters news agency based at Chennai (1890-95).

The dam was constructed surmounting many odds, with malaria and thick jungles taking a toll on workers. It was a huge challenge before him to construct the dam and divert the river course.

Pennycuik sowed the seeds of river interlinking to bring barren and rain-starved areas under cultivation. The road from Cumbom to Kumily, now part of the Kollam-Theni national highway, was constructed for bullock carts to move equipment to the dam site.

The first ropeway was also constructed there, which was later shifted to Munnar.

An agreement between the Pandya kings who ruled Madurai and the erstwhile Travancore kingdom was signed for water sharing, which is now a bone of contention between Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

The Madras presidency under the British rule looked for diverting the Periyar as the Kingdom of Madurai was facing acute shortage of water with drought taking a toll on people and cattle. This was in addition to the loss suffered by the farm sector.

The ruler of Cochin State initially objected to the water-diversion scheme as it was feared that the dam would affect water flow and movement of goods and people through the Periyar to the Arabian sea, the Madurai Manual says.

“Cultivation would not have been possible had the British engineer not constructed the dam,” Selvakumar, a farmer at Cumbom, says.

“Had Pennycuik not arrived here, economic prosperity would not have been there,” he says.

K.M. Abbas, president of a farmers forum, has even written a book on Pennycuik. To fund dam construction, gold ornaments were donated by Chettiar families and farmers in Cumbom valley also gave their meagre savings to Pennycuik.

An official of the Tamil Nadu Public Works Department, which controls the Mullaperiyar dam, said Pennycuik even sold his ancestral property in Britain and spent the amount for completing the works of the dam when the expenses exceeded the allotted funds.

The British government endowed him with the ‘Companion of Star of India’, a high civilian honour. He died on March 9, 1911 at Frimley in Britain.

Though the 125-year-old dam brought prosperity to the eastern side, people on the western side downstream are living in fear, concerned about the safety of the dam.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5yldpw/article32816692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tv-Mullaperiyar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/the-man-who-changed-the-course-of-the-periyar/article32816682.ece
98,2020/10/09,Coronavirus | Only 250 devotees daily at Sabarimala,"Temple to open for monthly puja on October 16.

A maximum of 250 devotees will be allowed daily at the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala when the temple opens for the five-day pujas in the Malayalam month of Thulam on October 16.

A meeting chaired by Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran here on Friday decided to allow the first 250 who register on the virtual queue portal daily to visit the temple adhering to the COVID-19 protocol.

COVID-19 negative certificate is mandatory and the test should be taken 48 hours before reaching Pampa. Those arriving without the certificate will have to undergo a test at the base camp at Nilackal. Health centres en route to Pampa are also equipped to conduct the COVID-19 test.

Pilgrims from other States will have to register on covid19jagratha.kerala.nic.in. for reaching the temple. Devotees in the BPL category should carry Ayushman Bharat card for free test and medical care.

Pilgrims will be allowed to trek to the temple only though Swami Ayappan Road. Paper plates will be made available for annadanam. Steel water bottles will be made available for ₹100, which will be refunded on the return of the bottle.

Bathing in the Pampa will not be allowed now and during the Mandalam- Makaravilakku season from November 16. Instead, showers will be installed by the Irrigation Department and the Kerala Water Authority.

The road from Nilackal to Pampa will be made motorable. The Minister gave directives to the Travancore Devaswom Board and the Pathanamthitta administration to complete the arrangements for a hassle-free pilgrim season.

The Minister said the decisions taken at the meeting would be subject to the approval of the High Court.

Police arrangements

State Police Chief Loknath Behera said the virtual queue facility would be operationalised from Saturday night or Sunday. Officers and other staff posted for duty would have to follow the COVID-19 guidelines.

All security arrangements were in place and Commandant, KAP 5th Battalion, K. Radhakrishnan has been posted as the police special officer.

99,2020/10/09,3 contenders for national butterfly status,"Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to choose one among them

A citizen poll to identify the national butterfly concluded with three species garnering the highest number of votes.

Krishna Peacock (Papilio krishna), Indian Jezebel (Delias eucharis), and Orange Oakleaf (Kallima inachus), the frontrunners, have unique features such as ability to camouflage as a dead leaf, exhibit iridescence to stave off predators, and aid farmers in getting rid of pests.

While the organisers will submit the list of the top-three to the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, the onus is on the Centre to choose one among them to join the ranks of the Bengal Tiger, Indian Peacock, Indian Lotus, banyan tree, and mango as yet another national symbol, says Kalesh Sadasivan, one of the core members of the organising group.

The nationwide poll organised by the National Butterfly Campaign Consortium, a collective of 50 butterfly experts and enthusiasts, from September 10 to the midnight of October 8 yielded 59,754 votes.

The highest number of votes were polled from Maharashtra (18,887). The month-long campaign also witnessed considerable support from other States, including Tamil Nadu (4,789), Chattisgarh (4,754), and West Bengal (3,676).

While the polling stood at less than 800 in Kerala on October 1, the quest for a national butterfly gained momentum later with 2,471 casting their votes from the State.

Blessed with a vibrant colour pattern, including vermilion (haldi – kumkum) , the Indian Jezebel (or Common Jezebel) is known to deter its predators with its flashy wing colours.

Regarded as soldiers of farmers, they also prey on parasites that infest fruit-bearing plants. Widely distributed, the species can be spotted in gardens and other lightly wooded areas.

Krishna Peacock, a flagship species for biodiversity and conservation , is generally found in large numbers in the Himalayas. Possessing a peculiarly large swallowtail, its iridescent green scales diffract light to coat itself in radiance.

Orange Oakleaf is commonly known as ‘dead leaf’ for its ability to camouflage as a dry autumn leaf while striking a stationary pose with its wings closed. The masquerade enables the species to prevent it from being devoured by birds in the moist forests of northern Western Ghats, central, northern and northeastern parts of India where they are generally found. Besides, the Oakleaf is also known to exhibit polyphenism as it assumes specific colour and size during dry and wet seasons.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/uapww0/article32816584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tv-Butterfly,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3-contenders-for-national-butterfly-status/article32816575.ece

102,2020/10/09,State’s epidemic curve still on its way up,"Thursday’s sudden drop in case burden may be a statistical aberration: experts

The State registered 9,250 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, when 68,321 samples were tested in the past 24 hours, making it clear that the epidemic curve is still on its way up. The test positivity rate has shown a slight dip from 14.6% to 13.5%

Thursday’s sudden and miraculous drop in daily case burden by nearly half the number was either a statistical aberration or some technical goof-ups that could have happened during data upload, experts said.

Chairperson of the government’s expert committee on COVID B. Ekbal clarified that the steep dip in cases and test positivity rate on Thursday was not an indication of the epidemic curve going down but could be a phenomenon that statistical experts call “Statistical Noise” (random irregularity in any real life data). Going by the current trends, the epidemic curve could plateau by October end, he said.

The State’s cumulative burden now stands at 2,68,100. A total of 1,75,304 persons having recovered from the disease, the number of active cases is 91,756.

The State recorded the highest number of recoveries on Friday with 8,048 patients getting discharged from the hospital. There are 650 patients who are critically ill and in ICUs, while another 161 remains on ventilator support.

With 25 more deaths which occurred in the past few weeks being added to the official list of COVID deaths, the cumulative death toll stands at 955 cases. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for seven deaths, four each in Kollam, Ernakulam and Malappuram, two in Alappuzha and one each in Kozhikode, Kasaragod, Kottayam and Thrissur.

Of the new cases reported, 98% or 9,083cases are locally acquired infections, with the authorities unable to establish an epidemiological link in 757 cases. This includes infections reported in 111 health-care workers.

Among districts, three districts recorded over a thousand cases, with Kozhikode on top with 1,205 cases, Malappuram 1,174 and Thiruvananthapuram 1,012 cases. Ernakulam has 911 cases, Alappuzha 793, Thrissur 755, Kollam 714, Palakkad 672, Kannur 556, Kottayam 522, Kasaragod 366, Pathanamthitta 290, Idukki 153 and Wayanad 127.

Ernakulam has the highest number of active cases at 12,405, followed by Thiruvananthapuram 11,731 and Kozhikode 11,121. Rest of the districts have less than 10,000 active cases.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/states-epidemic-curve-still-on-its-way-up/article32815835.ece
103,2020/10/09,Upbeat mood over opening tourism sector in Kerala,"Proposed opening from October 15

An upbeat mood prevails in the travel trade over the proposed opening of the tourism sector in the State from October 15 after six months of dampened activity following the pandemic-induced lockdown.

Though Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran has announced that initially the hill stations and places where visitors can be restricted will be opened up, the stakeholders of the badly hit tourism industry are exuberant to receive the domestic tourists.

The arrival of the visitors to the hill resort of Ponmudi in the capital district and to tourist resorts in Wayanad during the weekends, the interest shown by leading travel online portals like MakeMytrip, Goibibo and Booking.com on Kerala despite the uncertainties, have been projected as a positive sign for the revival of the tourism sector in the days ahead.

However, decision to postpone the opening of the bars in the State, notification of Munnar as a containment zone in the wake of spurt in COVID-19 cases and insistence on testing at the border check post of Muthanga for those coming from Karnataka and on seven days quarantine with hardly a week to go for opening the sector are concerns for the stakeholders.

“The demand is for drivable short tours now. Our properties are fully geared up to cater to the visitors who step in. The rooms in the resort in Ponmudi are sold out during the weekends. Increase in the number of trains and flights will give confidence for the citizens to travel,” an official of Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) said.

Hotels that remain closed and local travel agents are gearing up for receiving guests. “Enquiries have started coming from northern States. Small groups have started booking for arrivals in November and December. We are reserving them with the tag that everything will be subject to government guidelines,” says Abraham George, CMD of the Kochi-based Intersight Tours & Travel.

The demand for the rooms in the properties that opened up in Wayanad from those in northern districts has surprised the industry. “Wayand during the weekend is sold out, as holidayers from Bengaluru have also started arriving. Bachelors and families are arriving in good numbers,” says Prasad Manjali, MD and CEO, Citrine Hotels and Resorts.

Meanwhile, the opening of the sector has not cheered up the stakeholders on the beach resort of Kovalam as beaches do not figure in the initial opening phase.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/h71gl3/article32823592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tv-Tourism,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/upbeat-mood-over-opening-tourism-sector-in-kerala/article32815714.ece
104,2020/10/09,KC factions celebrate formation day,"Separate meetings held at different places to commemorate the day

Different factions of the Kerala Congress (KC) on Friday held separate functions to mark the 56th formation day of the party.

Inaugurating the celebrations organised by the Mani group, party leader Jose K. Mani, MP, said a final decision on the party's entry into a coalition would be taken in a few days. The forthcoming local body elections would be a setback for those who had tried to dismantle the Kerala Congress, an integral part of Kerala politics for more than five decades.

A steering committee meeting of the party, which was convened online, decided to raise various farmer-related issues before the State government for its immediate consideration. Marking the official launch of a green initiative, Mr. Mani planted a sapling at the party head quarters in Kottayam.

The Joseph group, on the other hand, organised a separate function at a private hotel in Kottayam to celebrate the occasion. Inaugurating the event, party leader P.J. Joseph, MLA, accused Mr. Mani of being treacherous and said the Mani faction had been unable to ensure a berth in the Left Democratic Front (LDF) depsite repeated attempts.

Meanwhile, the Kerala Congress (Jacob) faction convened a meeting of its high power committee in Kottayam. Inaugurating the meeting, party leader Anoop Jacob, MLA, launched a scathing attack on Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the Life Mission scam. The meeting decided to organise dharnas in front of government offices and in all constituency headquarters on Wednesday demanding the resignation of the Chief Minister.

In a separate event, Kerala Congress (Democratic) leader K.C. Joseph inaugurated a meeting of the party. The meeting resolved to fight against the move to destabilise the LDF-led government.

Meanwhile, the Kerala Congress faction led by P.C. Thomas observed the formation day of the party as anti-corruption day.

105,2020/10/09,Collector orders closure of Popular Finance branches,"All accounts frozen, transfer of assets prohibited

Pathanamthitta Collector P.B. Noohu on Friday issued a directive to close down all branch offices of Popular Finance Limited and its affiliates in Pathanamthitta and attach all assets, including cash and gold, kept in these offices.

The order, which follows directives from the Kerala High Court and the government, invokes Section 4 of the Financial Institutions Act, 2013 to protect the interests of investors.

It also seeks to prohibit transfer of any asset and freeze all accounts maintained by Popular Finance or its partners in all financial institutions, including cooperative banks and chit funds.

Accordingly, the Collector directed the District Police Chief to close down and seal all buildings owned by the firm and produce the keys, besides providing security to these offices, if required.

Further, the District Registrar was directed to take all necessary steps to prohibit the transfer and alienation of immovable property owned by the fraud-hit financial institution.

Directives were also issued to the District Lead Bank Manager, Joint Registrar of District Cooperative Societies, and other financial institutions in the district to take necessary steps to freeze all accounts of Popular Finance and allied institutions.

The Pathanamthitta Regional Transport Officer was also directed to provide details of motor vehicles owned by the firm or its associates to prevent the transfer of listed vehicles. Similarly, the District Subdivisional Magistrate and tahsildars have been directed to provide details of immovable property owned by the financial institution.

To ensure compliance with the instructions, the Collector has also called for action taken reports from the officials concerned on a weekly basis.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/collector-orders-closure-of-popular-finance-branches/article32815503.ece
106,2020/10/09,Houses inundated in flash floods in Thrissur,"Heavy rain in the night takes people by surprise

Heavy rain that lashed the district on Thursday night wreaked havoc in the outskirts of Thrissur. Many houses were inundated at Mattathur, Vellikulangara, Kodassery and Kodaly.

People panicked as the sudden rain in the night flooded irrigation canals, which were dry the previous day. The Mattathur irrigation canal overflowed at many places inundating around 150 houses at Mattathur and Vellikkulangara villages. Several acres of paddy fields with saplings were submerged.

Local people said water came through the canal like a flash flood. The service station road near Poovalithode, near Kodaly, went under water, flooding around 75 houses.

Electronic equipment and furniture in many houses were damaged in the unexpected flooding and kitchen utensils were washed away. Houses were submerged in Korachal Colony, Moonnumuri, Chettichal, and Chembuchira too.

According to the Mattathur panchayat president and village officers, water from the Kodassery hills reached Chelakkottu Canal, flooding Matthathur and Kodassery villages. However, the situation was under control now and there was no need to rehabilitate people, they said.

As it was cultivation time, the shutters of the canal were closed, which aggravated the situation, local people said. The water level dipped after the shutters were opened.

Around 20 acres of paddy ready for harvesting was destroyed in the Kodaly fields. Standing crops were damaged in Alukka Padam and Chembuchira too.

The Kappathode overflowed at Pariyaram, near Chalakudy, inundating standing crops such as tapioca, plantain, and vegetables. Encroachments on paddy fields and canals made the situation worse, said the farmers.

Meanwhile, a few families were shifted from Mechira and Mettippadam after mud and rock got washed into their houses in the flash floods. Around five houses were damaged at West Koratty and Mangalssery.

A huge tree got uprooted on the Wadakkanchery-Kunnamkulam road on Thursday night near the Good Shepherd ITI Institute disrupting traffic and power supply. The Fire and Rescue Services removed the tree and restored traffic.

Trees were uprooted at Chovvannur, Kanippayyur, and Kakkad areas too. Power supply was disrupted in many areas.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/houses-inundated-in-flash-floods-in-thrissur/article32815464.ece
107,2020/10/09,Magisterial probe gives clean chit to police,"Encounter death of a Maoist at a private resort at Lakkidi

A magisterial inquiry into the Maoist encounter at a private resort at Lakkidi in Wayanad district on March 6 last year gave clean chit to the police.

According to the report submitted to the District and Sessions Court here by former District Collector A.R. Ajayakumar revealed the death of C.P. Jaleel, 25, occurred in a gun fire between Maoists and the police at a private resort at Lakkidi.

The police had claimed that Thunderbolt commandos fired at him while he was extorting money from the resort staff. They claimed that the firing was in self-defence.

‘‘The circumstance of the incident, as inferred from the documents examined and the evidences adduced from the depositions of witness, reveal that the death occurred in gunfire by the Thunderbolt commandos,’’ Mr. Ajayakumar said in his 250 pages report.

Though the report had been submitted on November 5, 2019, C.P. Rasheed, Jaleel’s brother, got the copy of it on Tuesday. The report said the commandos were exercising their right to private defence while shooting at the victim and his companion. So no person can be said to be responsible for the death.

There is nothing available on record or on evidence to show any conspiracy or wilful omission, the report said .

However, Mr. Rasheed told The Hindu that the report was an arbitrary one to give clean chit to the police and Thunderbolt commandos, who had participated in the encounter. The report was prepared after considering the words of the police to protect the officials who had engaged in the operation.

Scientific evidences, including the ballistic report and forensic examination report, were not considered for preparing it. The evidences for preparing the two reports were wilfully delayed nearly seven months after the incident, Mr. Rasheed alleged.

Moreover the report was quite contrary to the recent ballistic and forensic findings, he said. Though two cartridges, which were not used by the commandos or the Maoists, were found from the site, it was yet to be examined.

Cracks were purposefully made on the cartridges to destroy evidences, he said. The magisterial report should be submitted to the Chief Magistrate Court here but, it was submitted in the District and Sessions Court. The video visuals recorded in the DVR of the system installed at the resort were not consider for preparing the report, he said.

Mr. Rasheed said he would adopt legal steps seeking a probe by a government agency into what it termed a fake encounter in the wake of the contradictory reports.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/magisterial-probe-gives-clean-chit-to-police/article32815432.ece
108,2020/10/09,SNDP stance on Sree Narayana Open University VC misplaced: CPI(M),"‘No one caste can claim a patent for the seer’s legacy’

CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on Friday said the contention of the SNDP Union leadership that only a member of a particular caste could assume the mantle of Vice-Chancellorship of the Sree Narayana Guru Open University was a misplaced thought.

No particular religion or caste could claim to have obtained the exclusive patent for the legacy of the social reformer. The guru’s teachings and bequest to society were enduring and universal.

Those who claim to practice the values propounded by the seer should not view matters through the narrow, restrictive and resentful prism of caste. They should not forget that the guru had battled for a casteless and secular society.

Mr Balakrishnan was reacting to the report that SNDP union general secretary Vellapally Natesan had slammed the government for not appointing a member from the ‘Sree Narayana community’ to the post of the Vice-Chancellor.

Mr Natesan had singled out Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel for choosing a non-resident Keralite from Malabar as the head of the university. Mr Natesan had accused the government of stabbing the ‘Sree Narayana devotees’ in the eye and sacrificing their welfare to appease some vested interests.

He said the government, at the instance of Mr Jaleel, had passed over several qualified candidates with Left-liberal leanings from the ‘Sree Narayana community’ for the Vice-Chancellor’s post.

Mr Natesan’s abrupt change of tack and his attempt cast Mr Jaleel as a growing liability for the ruling front in the election year appeared to have caught the LDF by surprise.

Mr Natesan had backed the government during the Sabarimala agitation. He had headed the State-sponsored Navodhana Samrakshana Samiti (Renaissance Protection Samiti), which was widely seen as a counter to a perceived right-wing drift in society. His grouse about the appointment has reportedly become a talking point in the LDF.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sndp-stance-on-sree-narayana-open-university-vc-misplaced-cpim/article32815371.ece
109,2020/10/09,NIA seeks extension of accused’s remand,"ED opposes bail plea of Swapna Suresh

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has sought to extend the detention of the accused in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case to ascertain “whether funds in the form of terror funds, were used in the crime,” by forces in the UAE and inimical to India.

The agency sought 90 more days to complete the investigation.

It submitted that the accused had hatched criminal conspiracy, recruited and used persons, collected funds and used encrypted communication platforms for committing the crime, which were intended to threaten the economic security of India.

Seeks more time

Time is required to cover all aspects of the crime which has transnational ramifications. The spread of COVID-19 pandemic had curtailed the travel and personal interactions of witnesses, it submitted.

The accused raised funds in India and abroad by smuggling gold in large quantities and multiple times, deliberately and intentionally through diplomatic cargo of UAE Consulate, for damaging the friendly relations with UAE.

The funds thus raised were repeatedly used for smuggling more gold into the country, and not for any pecuniary benefit. The arrested accused have to be detained to hold investigation abroad and securing of crucial evidence, especially from the UAE, it submitted.

Bail application

Meanwhile, Kausar Edappagath, Principal District and Sessions Judge, Ernakulam, posted the bail application of Swapna Suresh in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act case booked by the Enforcement Directorate against her for orders to October 13.

Opposing the bail application, Additional Solicitor General Suryaprakash V. Raju contended that the accused was not eligible for statutory bail as she had not raised the plea before the filing of the final complaint in the case.

However, Geo Paul, her counsel, submitted that he had moved a motion in the court to the effect well before filing of the final complaint. He also sought bail on the ground that the accused was a woman and had a young child.

The ED argued against granting the bail considering the gravity of the offence and her high influence.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nia-seeks-extension-of-accuseds-remand/article32815101.ece
110,2020/10/09,Probe on into alleged attack on Abdullakutty,"BJP leader’s car had met with an accident at Kottakkal on Thursday night

The police have begun an investigation into the BJP allegation that an attempt was made on the life of BJP national vice president A.P. Abdullakutty at Randathani near Kottakkal on Thursday night.

Mr. Abdullakutty was involved in a road accident at Randathani when it rained around 10.15 p.m. on Thursday. He was on his way from Kochi to Kannur. The police said that when his car hit another car in the front that had applied brakes, a lorry hit his car from behind. Mr. Abdullakutty’s car was dented badly in the front and the back.

The BJP claimed that the accident that took place in Malappuram district was a deliberate attempt on his life. But police and the local people said that it looked like a natural accident while climbing a slope during the rain. Similar accidents had taken place there before.

Mr. Abdullakutty was reportedly taunted by a few persons at Veliyankode near Ponnani earlier. The police said he had an argument with them. Mr. Abdullakutty said that he had been insulted by those people, and he suspected that the accident consequent to that quarrel was a planned one.

There was a distance of 40 kms from the place where he was taunted to the place where he met with the accident.The lorry involved in the accident belonged to a man from Oorakam. The lorry was returning from Alathur near Tirur via Puthanathani after transporting quarry waste from Vengara for road work.

The police registered two cases, one at Kadampuzha station for accident and the other at Ponnani station for insulting Mr. Abdullakutty. The police seized a surveillance camera recording available at the shop where the BJP leader had the quarrel. However, they could not review the video footage as the password was missing.

District Police Chief U. Abdul Kareem said that they would decode the surveillance camera footage and examine the reported incident.

Meanwhile, BJP leaders such as State president K. Surendran, Malappuram district president Ravi Thelath and Palakkad zone vice president K.K. Surendran demanded action against the guilty.

111,2020/10/09,Kerala safest place in COVID times: Shylaja,"The Minister was addressing CII’s 9th Edition of Kerala Health Tourism programme

Kerala is the safest place during the COVID-19 pandemic with only 0.36 per cent mortality rate and medical value tourism has immense potential in the State, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has said.

The State has number of advantages in attracting foreign tourists and the expertise in indigenous medicine can play a vital role in health tourism, she said.

She was addressing through video conference the month-long CII’s 9th Edition of Kerala Health Tourism programme- a conference and exhibition on healthcare, medical value travel, medical devices that began on Friday.

The Minister suggested developing more Ayurveda medicine production centres with modern standards and focus on import of Ayurvedic medicines.

“More quality and affordable treatments should be made available. The common people should also benefit from tourism,” she said.

In his address, Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta said although only 10 percent of foreign tourists travelling to the country visit Kerala, the longest stay by these tourists was in the State. The government will support and give incentives to the tourism industry that would bring revenue to the State and more employment generation in this sector, he said.

Thomas John Muthoot, chairman, CII Kerala, stressed on the importance and value of promoting medical value tourism in the State. The quality of health care offered by the doctors, nurses and support staff, make medical tourism in Kerala a preferred choice of patients seeking healthcare solutions.

M. I. Sahadulla, convener, CII healthcare panel, and CMD, KIMS HEALTH, said 13-15 per cent growth is expected in this sector and highlighted that 3-4 jobs are created with one medical value traveller.

Delegates from 42 countries from the field of health-oriented tourism attended.

A panel discussion on ‘Opportunity for medical value travel in God’s Own Country, Kerala – the sunrise destination’ was held. A virtual expo organised with key players from healthcare, medical devices and personal protective equipment will be on till November 7.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-safest-place-in-covid-times-shylaja/article32814904.ece
112,2020/10/09,CBI hands over case diary of Life Mission probe to court,"State govt. had challenged the FIR in the court

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probing the irregularities in the LIFE Mission project implementation on Friday handed over to the Kerala High Court the case diary relating to the probe.

The CBI on Thursday sought permission of Justice V.G. Arun to produce the case diary for perusal in connection with the case filed by the State government and Santhosh Eappen of Unitac challenging the FIR.

Meanwhile, Congress MLA Anil Akkara on whose complaint CBI registered a case said in an affidavit filed in the court that the Consulate General of UAE had no authority to float any tenders on behalf of UAE Red Crescent Authority for the construction of apartments and health centres with its financial aid for LIFE Mission. This was in response to the claim of the company that it had participated in a tender floated by the Consulate General of UAE.

Mr. Akkara further stated that the claim in the petition of Mr. Eappen that ₹3.80 crore received by the companies was paid to Khalid, an officer of the UAE consulate, was not true. It was a cooked up one to cover the illegal transactions made by the companies of the petitioner with the foreign contribution received by it.

The alleged transaction made by the companies of the petitioner to Isomo Trading Company was also violative of the provisions of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. The allegation in the petition that one of the phones purchased by the petitioner as demanded by Swapna Suresh was presented to Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala was a politically motivated one.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cbi-hands-over-case-diary-of-life-mission-probe-to-court/article32814889.ece
113,2020/10/09,New perennial woody herb species spotted in Kerala,"Rare plant found near Ananthapura lake temple in Kasaragod and hence named ‘Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis’

A team of researchers have reported a new species of perennial woody herb of the genus Lepidagathis from the northern laterite plateaus of Kasaragod district in the State.

Since this rare plant was spotted in the neighbourhood of the Ananthapura lake temple, it has been named ‘Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis’ after the famed temple dedicated to Ananthapadmanabha.

An article on the discovery authored by P. Biju of Government College, Kasaragod; V.S. Anil Kumar and S. Arya of University College, Thiruvananthapuram; E.J. Josekutty, Government Brennen College, Thalassery; and Jomy Augustine, St Thomas College, Pala; has been published in the latest edition of Phytotaxa, a journal on plant taxonomy.

The plant was spotted during field explorations in the region, V.S. Anil Kumar said. With its discovery, the number of species of the genus Lepidagathis (family Acanthaceae) found in India has risen to 34. “Plants of this species are locally called ‘Paramullu’. As far as we know, Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis is endemic to the region,” he said.

To date, eight species of the genus Lepidagathis and three varieties have been reported from Kerala, of which four are endemic to the Western Ghats.

Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis is closely related to Lepidagathis keralensis reported from Madayippura in Kannur district. Detailed studies have established the former as a hitherto undescribed species, he said.

An erect woody herb that grows to a height of 50-100 cm, Lepidagathis ananthapuramensis is characterised by a hairy and branched stem, thick and woody rootstock, hairy leaf veins, and flowers clustered on one side of the inflorescence.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/99d7yh/article32823600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20200721165635,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/new-perennial-woody-herb-species-spotted-in-kerala/article32814851.ece
114,2020/10/09,Unaided schools bound to provide free education: CBSE,"‘Managements could get the cost reimbursed from govt.’

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Thursday informed the Kerala High Court that private unaided schools are bound to provide free education to children belonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections as per the provisions in the Right to Education Act (RTE).

In a statement filed in the High Court, the CBSE submitted that school managements could get the cost reimbursed from the respective State governments. The statement was filed in response to a petition by Albert K.P. of Ernakulam for a directive to take appropriate steps to appoint officers to assess actual tuition fees for conducting online classes.

The petitioner contended that due to ongoing lockdown and economic slow down, most of the parents were in dire straits. Therefore, they found it difficult to pay the full fee demanded by the school authorities.

The State government submitted that it discouraged parents to choose unaided CBSE schools. In fact, a combined reading of the RTE Act and Kerala Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules showed that parents of a child could not choose schools, ignoring the statute requiring them to admit their wards in the neighbouring school.

A child could get admission in a neighbouring government school in the State as aided schools within the walking distance were established as provided in the rules. The government submitted that a total of 5,995 government schools are functioning in the State, while the aided sector had 8,210 schools. The number of unaided schools came to 1,823. So, the plea to disburse tuition fees to the schools was unsustainable.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/unaided-schools-bound-to-provide-free-education-cbse/article32814847.ece
115,2020/10/09,"NHAI to kick off ₹13,196 cr road infra works","Reach I of Kazhakuttam-Karode Bypass to be commissioned on October 13

Overcoming a host of hurdles, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will commission the four-lane 26.78 km Kazhakuttam-Mukkola Bypass of National Highway (NH) 66 in the capital and kick off the six-laning of NH 66 from Thalapady on the Kerala-Karnataka border on October 13.

Through videoconference, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will dedicate the 26.79-km Reach I of the Kazhakuttom Bypass to the nation in the presence of Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan and Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran, Ministers, and legislators.

Eight works of the NHAI, estimated to cost ₹13,196 crore including six-laning of the NH 66 in Kasaragod, Kannur and Kozhikode districts with a Right of Way (RoW) of 45 metre and reconstruction of Cheruthoni bridge along the NH 185 in Idukki district that was damaged in the 2018 floods, will also be launched at the function.

In the reconstruction of the Cheruthoni bridge, the NHAI will raise the height of the bridge to ensure safe travel between Adimali and Kumily.

The works in Kasaragod, Kannur and Kozhikode involves the first 39-km corridor from Thalapady to Chengala in Kasaragod district, Chengala-Neeleswaram, Perol-Taliparamba,Taliparamba-Muzhappilangad, reconstruction of the Paloli and Murad bridges into six-lane,Vadakara-Azhiyur-Vengalam, and Kozhikode bypass that will link Malappuram and Kozhikode districts.

The road corridor being six-laned is part of the 526-km NH 66 corridor from Thalapady to Kazhakuttam in the capital. At present, the State can boast of a four-lane NH corridor only on the 32-km stretch from Chalakudy in Thrissur to Edappally in Ernakulam.

The much-delayed six-laning of the NH 66 was being taken up following a series of initiatives taken by the LDF government and the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Gadkari, Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran said.

The hurdles over fixing the alignment, acquiring the land, and fixing the compensation were overcome through the talks, the Minister said. The State was paying 25% cost of the land being acquired by the NHAI and the funds were being made available by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB).

For getting speedy clearance, the entire NH 66 corridor in the State was split further into small packages to take advantage of the Centre’s decision to allow the MoRTH to approve projects of up to ₹2,000 crore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nhai-to-kick-off-13196-cr-road-infra-works/article32814700.ece
116,2020/10/09,One night’s rain makes city canals overflow,"Water from Ulloor and Pattom canals breaches banks at several points.

One night’s rain on Thursday was enough for the water level in the Ulloor and Pattom canals to rise to the brim and breach the banks at several points by the next morning. Water seeped into the adjacent roads and into some of the houses that line the canal.

Although the Major Irrigation Department had removed all the obstructions in the canals as part of the city Corporation’s project ahead of the monsoons this year, the canal still does not have the capacity to hold all the water during heavy rains. The absence of even a low side wall in many places makes matters worse.

Decrease in depth

According to Pattom ward councillor Remya Ramesh, the issue cannot be solved until the depth of the canal is increased by removing all the silt that has accumulated over the years.

“As usual, water entered our home near Murinjapalam last night as the rain intensified. The removal of obstructions that get collected near the bridges or at the narrow regions of the canal alone cannot solve this problem. With silt and waste getting collected on the floor, the depth of the canal has reduced considerably over time. Also, in some places, residents carry out plantain cultivation in areas where sand has collected and formed small land portions by the side of the canal. This also constricts the flow,” she says.

Mayor K. Sreekumar says that the Corporation’s projects for the improvement of the canals in the city are progressing.

“Water flowed smoothly through the main Amayizhanjan canal without overflowing in any places owing to all the work that the Corporation carried out recently. The work on the Ulloor-Pattom canal will be taken up soon too. Overflowing happens also because of the high-intensity rains that we are getting these days. Even in the Ulloor canal, the water receded as soon as the rains seized,” says Mr. Sreekumar.

A major project for the construction of side walls along the Ulloor canal and for desilting, at a cost of ₹9 crore, has been in the works for some time. Another similar project for the area from Kannammoola to Akkulam at a cost of ₹25 crore is also about to take off.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wdmjkl/article32814656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200909133009,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/one-nights-rain-makes-city-canals-overflow/article32814657.ece
117,2020/10/09,"Govt stalls action against elephant owners, orders probe","Decision based on a plea that claimed the owners were falsely accused of illegally trading captive elephants

The wildlife crime cases booked against two elephant owners are taking a curious turn with the State government putting on hold all proceedings against them after considering a petition from the Elephant Owners Association.

In his order, the Principal Secretary (Forest) has asked the Chief Wildlife Warden to stop all the proceedings against the elephant owners considering a representation submitted to the Forest Minister and also called for an urgent report on the complaint that Forest officials were personally defaming the elephant owners.

Incidentally, The Hindu had on Thursday reported that seven cases were booked against M.V. Prasanth of Thiruvananthapuram, V. Shaji of Kaveri Puthenkulam, Kollam, and few others, and 15 elephants were taken into custody. It was the YouTube video of Mr. Shaji in which he claimed to have traded over 200 elephants brought from other States that triggered the case. The elephant owners were booked for illegally transporting, trading and maintaining captive elephants in violation of the Wildlife Protection Act and Captive Elephant Management Rules, Kerala.

In his representation to Forest Minister, G. Krishnaprasad, president of the association, complained that the officials were unnecessarily targeting Mr. Shaji. He also alleged that the Forest officials raised a ruckus at the house of Mr. Shaji after falsely alleging that his elephants did not possess ownership certificates.

In the case of Mr. Prasanth, the association charged that he was being falsely implicated regarding the death of an elephant in 2018. The Forest officials had conducted the post mortem of the animal and taken its tusks into custody, it was submitted.

Incidentally, the Forest Department launched the probe against Mr. Prasanth on a complaint from Aana Ulsava Samrakshana Sahaya Sangham, Thrissur. In its complaint, the organisation pointed out that an elephant was illegally transported to the State in violation of the rules and instructions of the Kerala High Court.

Responding to the government order, A.A. Aneesh, State secretary of the Sangham, said the organisation would challenge the order in a court of law. Though the organisation had filed several complaints regarding the illegal practices involving captive elephants, the Forest officials never responded to it, he alleged.

At the same time, senior forest officials indicated that the legal proceedings in the cases booked against elephant owners in the courts would continue. First Information Reports were filed at Judicial First Class Magistrate Court 1, Nedumangad and Judicial First Class Magistrate Court 2 (Forest Offences), Punalur, they pointed out.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-stalls-action-against-elephant-owners-orders-probe/article32814591.ece
118,2020/10/09,Vellappally slams govt. over open varsity VC post,"‘Key positions inaccessible to backward and Scheduled communities’

Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan on Friday slammed the LDF government for not appointing a community member as the Vice Chancellor of newly inaugurated Sree Narayana Guru Open University in Kollam.

Alleging that the government has been persistently making key positions inaccessible to backward and Scheduled communities, Mr. Natesan said that the decision was a devastating blow to the community.

“We wanted a person who has studied Sree Narayana philosophy to head the university named after one of the greatest social reformers world has ever seen, but the government simply ignored our demand. It has left the community disappointed and the incident has dented the image of the LDF government,” he said.

First VC

The government had appointed P.M Mubarak Pasha as the first Vice Chancellor of Sree Narayana Guru Open University. Dr. Pasha had served as the Director of the College Development Council and Director of School of Distance Education, at the University of Calicut and also as the Principal of Farook College, Kozhikode.

At present he works as the Head of Governance and Strategic Planning at Oman-based National University of Science and Technology.

Accusing that the government had succumbed to the pressure of minorities and organised religious outfits, the Yogam general secretary said: “There is widespread resentment against the decision and it has also irked some members of the LDF Ministry. The community was offered Pro Vice Vhancellor post with limited powers. It seems they don’t want any Ezhava community member to take key positions.”

Flays Jaleel

He added that Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel had hurt the secular values of the State by appointing an NRI and a resident of Malabar as the first Vice Chancellor disregarding several qualified persons from the community.

“Also, the community organisations were not given any representation during the inauguration of the Guru’s statue in Thiruvananthapuram recently,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vellappally-slams-govt-over-open-varsity-vc-post/article32814289.ece
119,2020/10/09,Youtuber assault case: Anticipatory bail pleas rejected,"A district court here on Friday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of dubbing artiste Bhagyalakshmi and two other women activists indicted for the physical attack on ""abusive"" YouTuber Vijayan. P. Nair.

N Seshadrinathan, Additional Sessions Judge 2 who heard their petition, said the court could not encourage vigilantism. The judiciary was constitutionally bound to uphold the rule of law. The court could not allow self-appointed groups to dispense justice without legal authority.

The police had earlier booked the women, including activists Diya Sana and Sreelakshmi Arackal, on the charge of barging into the room of Nair and assaulting him for ""uploading"" a slanderous video purportedly about Bhagyalakshmi on his widely watched and highly controversial blog.

Public prosecutor, Vembayam Hakkim, who opposed the bail plea, termed the attack on Nair as an unlawful act of vendetta and personal payback.

The women had recorded the assault on camera, disseminated the footage widely on social media and also shared it with television channels. Releasing the accused on bail could provoke copycat acts of vigilantism in society, he argued.

The police had booked the women on the charges of criminal trespass, assault, verbal abuse and theft. (The accused had allegedly appropriated the laptop and mobile phone used by Nair and later surrendered the devices to the police.)

The high profile incident, amplified by social media and television news channels, had triggered a protracted and, in some measure, polarising debate on gender equations in Kerala.

It had also raised the question of whether the activists had staged a demonstrative political act against misogyny or attempted to justify physical assault, rather ill-advisedly, as a righteous and definitive form of retribution against abusive persons.

Several left leaders had expressed solidarity with the women activists. Kerala State Women's Commission chairperson M. C. Josephine had pointed out that assaults on the dignity and person of women were on the increase and many abusers often exploited their social media reach to defame their victims. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said that protests should always be within the bounds of law and vigilantism did not augur well for society.

The women activists are likely to move the High Court for anticipatory bail.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/youtuber-assault-case-anticipatory-bail-pleas-rejected/article32813768.ece
120,2020/10/09,Bars in State to stay closed for now,"Government shelves proposal to allow in-person service in bars, beer-and-wine parlours

The State government on Thursday walked back on a proposal to allow bars and beer-and- wine parlours to open for in-person service.

A high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan reportedly concluded that allowing indoor dining in bars immediately could accelerate the spread of the virus.

There are an estimated 700-odd bars and 385 beer-and-wine parlours in the State. Most operate in air-conditioned indoor spaces with little scope for ventilation. They are designed to create a private atmosphere, and few have room to seat customers in a spaced-out matter. Moreover, it would be challenging for the administration to enforce the pandemic prevention social behaviour code in such private environs.

Financial troubles

The bar and hotel industry, which was reeling from a steep financial decline, had requested the government to allow them to open their doors for business.

It pointed out that Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Punjab had allowed indoor service in bars. The industry also flagged the job loss caused by the pandemic and said many establishments were on the verge of closure.

It pointed out that bars had remitted the full licence fee for the 2020-21 fiscal. The industry has sought a tax reprieve from the government. It had demanded the lifting of the rule that bars could only purchase the amount of liquor they sold through the BevQ application. The government has not made any commitment officially.

However, it reportedly felt the short-term relief for the hotel industry could cause broader losses in terms of public health and finance. It would review the request of bar hoteliers after there is a tangible fall in the COVID-19 caseload.

The sale of legal liquor is also a significant source of State revenue. In 2018-19 fiscal, Bevco raked in ₹14,504.67 crore from the sale of branded liquor, beer, and wine, a raise of ₹1,567.8 crore compared to the previous financial year.

Sale of legal liquor had declined by a substantial percentage since March. A State official said bars and beer parlours could continue to sell alcohol as takeaways via the BevQ application until further notice.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bars-in-state-to-stay-closed-for-now/article32809710.ece
121,2020/10/09,Villagers threaten to launch stir against quarrying in Vengapally,"Loud explosions, movement of heavy transport vehicles damaging houses, roads.

Protest is brewing against the working of granite quarries in Vengapally grama panchayat in Wayanad district.

As many as four granite quarries were functioning in various parts of the panchayat and most of the quarries were functioning by flouting the norms set by the Mining and Geology Department, P. Kunjahammed, chairman of an action committee of villagers, said.

A quarry unit in ward 9 was functioning in a human habitation and the explosions from the quarry were posing a severe threat to normal life, he said.

Around 100 families live in the area and the working of the quarry unit had upset their lives. Many houses and wells in the area were damaged by the vibrations caused by the loud explosions, he said.

The indiscriminate quarrying had adversely affected the natural water sources such as springs and streams in the area, K. Damodaran Kuruppu, convenor of the organisation, said.

The movement of heavy vehicles to transport large granite boulders had damaged the roads too, he said.

Though the quarry owners were directed to alert the villagers before explosions by sounding sirens, they were yet to obey it, he said.

Now, the quarry owners were competing to exploit maximum resources within the given period by using heavy machinery such as excavators, rock-breakers, and compressors, he said.

Though many complaints were submitted to officials concerned, they were yet to adopt any measures to address the issues, he said.

They warned the authorities that if the grama panchayat did not cancel the licence given to the quarries, the people would launch an indefinite agitation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udnofp/article32808234.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvwyquarrying2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/villagers-threaten-to-launch-stir-against-quarrying-in-vengapally/article32808235.ece

As many as 1.04 lakh Kudumbashree neighbourhood group (NHG) members have submitted applications to the Kudumbashree community development societies (CDSs) for joining the Kerala State Financial Enterprise (KSFE)’s Vidyashree scheme.

Vidyashree is a microcredit scheme being implemented in association with the Kudumbashree to enable member families to avail themselves of laptops for the online education of their children, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

How it works

The loan amount is ₹15,000 which will have to be repaid in 30 instalments of ₹500 a month. Those who join the scheme for laptop will be given the gadget once the third instalment is paid. The KSFE will then release the cost of the laptop to an agency empanelled by it. Those who join the scheme for the purpose of savings will be able to withdraw their money from the 13th month of onset of the scheme.

Concessional rates

The agencies will be empanelled by the department to provide laptops at concessional rates as per the specifications stipulated by the General Education Department. Their cost will be less than ₹15,000. The interest will be paid by the government and the KSFE.

The 1.04 lakh applicants belong to 30,788 NHGs. The maximum number of applications is from Malappuram – 29,368. Kollam and Pathanamthitta follow with 15,516 and 14,979, respectively. Of the applicants, 97,509 are interested in laptop procurement. A total of 47,538 applications have been forwarded from the Kudumbashree to the KSFE.

The enrolment will continue for a month, and the number of applications is expected to go up.

124,2020/10/09,Operation Stonewall unearths widespread malpractices,"VACB inspections of quarries and tipper lorries

Inspections by the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Thursday at quarries and tipper lorries unearthed widespread malpractices in connection with the transportation of quarry products such as hard rock and crushed stone.

Christened ‘Operation Stonewall’, the inspections were carried out by 67 squads. Vigilance officials found that a large number of tipper lorries transporting quarry products were operating without the passes issued by the Department of Mining and Geology. Many of the vehicles that did possess the passes were found to be carrying excess loads.

Of the 306 vehicles inspected till Thursday evening, 133 were found to be operating without the mandatory passes. As many as 157 lorries were found to be carrying loads in excess of the permissible limit, Vigilance director Sudesh Kumar said.

Inspections carried out in the quarries revealed irregularities in 27 units. In many quarries, the inspections were continuing late into Thursday evening, the VACB director said.

Without permits

Rules require vehicles transporting quarry products from quarries and crusher units to be registered with the Kerala Online Mining Permit Awarding Service (KOMPAS) portal of the department and obtain the passes. But vigilance officials found that most quarries were allowing vehicles that do not possess the passes also to transport rocks and minerals. They also found that planks were being fitted to the sides of the trucks to illegally increase cargo space.

The raids were conducted on the basis of information received by the VACB director that the government was losing crores of rupees by way of royalty owing to the malpractices and that officials of the Mining and Geology Department and the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) were remaining silent on the issue.

Vehicles carrying excess loads were handed over to the MVD. The MVD has collected approximately ₹11 lakh as fine from vehicles carrying excess load. The vehicles that lacked passes were seized and handed over to the Department of Mining and Geology.

The raids were led by H. Venkatesh, IG (VACB). The inspections would continue in the coming days, Mr. Sudesh Kumar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ws0qw5/article32807856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201008-WA0125,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/operation-stonewall-unearths-widespread-malpractices/article32807857.ece

Mr. Peter was under treatment for COVID-19 at the Government Medical College Hospital here. He was admitted to the hospital on October 3, but had developed pneumonia and had been on life support.

A native of Veli in the district, Mr. Peter was known for his untiring efforts aimed at upliftment of the fisher community. Over the past several decades, he was an active participant in numerous struggles on issues impacting the community at the State and national level and environmental issues in general.

A former State president of the Kerala Swatantra Matsya Thozhilali Federation (KSMTF), Mr. Peter was currently serving as editor of Alakal, the mouthpiece of the KSMTF. This was his second term as general secretary of the NFF.

He strived to create awareness among the fishing community as well as the general public on matters pertaining to fisheries, including the annual monsoon season trawling ban and the policies governing the sector.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Peter and the NFF were actively involved in training fishermen communities in the maritime States to use online tools to empower themselves in the emerging scenario.

Recently, he was also involved in the struggle to highlight the apprehension of the fisher community in Kerala with regard to the new shipping corridor that passes close to the Kerala coast.

126,2020/10/09,"Actor Sana Khan quits movies, says she wants to ‘serve humanity’","The ‘Bigg Boss’ star has featured in films like Salman Khan’s ‘Jai Ho’ and STR’s Tamil movie ‘Silambattam’

TV-film actor Sana Khan on Friday said she was leaving acting to spend her life in the service of humanity and following the orders of her “creator.”

The 33-year-old actor posted statements in Hindi, English and Urdu announcing her decision to leave the industry.

“Today I am talking to you standing at a crucial juncture of my life. For years, I have been living the Showbiz (film industry) life, and during this time I have been blessed with all kinds of fame, honour and wealth from my fans for which I am grateful to them,” Khan wrote.

She further said she has been pondering about her purpose in life and what happens to a person after death.

The actor said she decided to leave the “showbiz lifestyle forever“.

“All brothers and sisters are requested to pray for me to Allah to accept my repentance and grant me the true ability to live in accordance with my determination of spending my life following the commandments of my Creator and in the service of humanity, and grant me perseverance in to.

“Finally, all brothers and sisters are requested to not consult me with regards to any showbiz work henceforth,” Khan said.

As an actor, Khan has featured in many Hindi and regional language films. She made her debut in Bollywood with “Yehi Hai High Society” in 2005 and went on to star in movies like “Halla Bol”, “Jai Ho”, “Wajah Tum Ho” and “Toilet: Ek Prem Katha.” She also acted in Tamil in movies like STR’s “Silambattam.”

Khan also participated in reality shows such as “Bigg Boss” (season six) and “Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi 6”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/po5fp0/article32814084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sana,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-sana-khan-quits-movies-says-she-wants-to-serve-humanity/article32814085.ece
127,2020/10/09,"Ritu Arya on real life heroes, British comedy and her songs for 2020","The British-Indian actor of Netflix’s ‘The Umbrella Academy’ and ‘Red Notice’ says Bollywood influenced her to become the poster girl for diversity and inclusivity

She is no stranger to the ardent TV viewer (we’ll get to that later). But there has been an incredible rise in ‘Ritu Arya origin’ Google searches since she emerged as The Umbrella Academy Season 2 standout back in August. “It’s been crazy. I’m just overwhelmed with how many women have reached out and said how inspired and proud and empowered they feel, to see a South Asian woman play a role like that,” begins Arya.

A wild card on the Netflix show about a dysfunctional family of adopted children who possess superpowers, her Lila Pitts sure shook things up: right from her introductory scene in a psychiatric ward, where she is seen sticking cigarettes up her nose, to overpowering every one of the superhero siblings in the final episode and vanishing with her time-travelling briefcase. In the interviews that followed, the British-Indian actor has said a lot about Lila, her feisty, rather “unhinged” character, and not enough about life before and after Lila.

So Arya takes some time off the sets in Atlanta, where her big-budget action-comedy, Red Notice, is being filmed, to get on a call with The Hindu Weekend. And flesh out what we already know: she grew up in London, speaks Hindi and Punjabi, graduated in Astrophysics, went to drama school, and is part of an alt-pop band with a recent single titled ‘L.O.V.E’.

Weird is good

“I think growing up I thought there seemed to be quite an inequality between men and women, especially in my community,” says Arya, choosing her words carefully. “I have two brothers and I wanted to keep pushing the boundaries of my expression and freedom. Which often meant that my parents thought I was a bit weird.” They were supportive, though, about her interest in Astrophysics, playing drums as a teen, acting, everything.

Getting into character For her Lila Pitts prep, Arya had reportedly put up porn in her trailer. She’d read how Angelina Jolie had done that for her 1999 film, Girl, Interrupted. “For Lila, I tried not to think too much about fictional characters as I feel it would be about copying someone else’s creation as opposed to making it your own. I’m careful with what I’m watching while I’m creating a character. I did read Fight Club. And I watched Girl, Interrupted and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” she says.

In retrospect, she notes, she was very strong-minded and would have gone straight to acting, if that was what she wanted. “I think it all started from watching Bollywood films: Shah Rukh Khan, who is still my idol, and Kajol, from Darr and Baazigar to DDLJ… all those films I grew up loving and thought, maybe I should be that, because I don’t see these people on TV that I’m watching in the UK.”

Fans (and there are many; her Instagram followers this year have reached 4,58,000) tracking Arya will find her in several sci-fi shorts and TV appearances from 2013 onwards. There’s Humans and the BBC soap, Doctors, Sherlock, Doctor Who, Feel Good and 2019’s festive rom-com, Last Christmas. Lady Parts, a 2018 sitcom about an all-female Muslim punk band, checks her favourite boxes: comedy and diversity. There are many more like it on this actor’s list, for good reason. Arya, whose Lila Pitts has a twisted sense of humour and possibly some of the best lines in TUA season 2 — “You are an open book written for very dumb children” she tells her love interest, Diego Hargreeves — plays an INTERPOL agent, chasing the world’s most wanted art thief, in Red Notice.

In the video for L.O.V.E, which the three KIN band members filmed individually during lockdown, Arya holds up a sign saying KINfest. Perhaps it references the many music festivals we are missing this year?Arya, also a songwriter, says the single is not about romantic love, but love for life. This track and the KINspire Me mixtapes on Spotify have drawn many Netflix regulars to her music. Here she shares her playlist that defines 2020: | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Looking racism in the eye

Arya likes to keep her personal life private — and that includes her age (27 according to the Internet, 32 going by a people.com report). But when I ask her if she ever had to struggle with gender and cultural stereotypes, she is remarkably candid. She admits that in a world of systemic racism, she has been affected both directly and indirectly. “From a young age, I would see the women in the kitchen serving the men who would drink and party. I was bullied at my predominantly white school, called all sorts of names. Only last year someone spat on me on the bus, telling me to ‘go back home’… I could go on and on but to be honest, I use this to empower myself to create change,” she says, adding, “It drives me to push boundaries for women and people of colour, to gain further equality by taking up space and having a voice. I try not to complain, rather lead by example. And always, always leading from love and compassion.”

128,2020/10/09,‘The Lie’ and ‘Black Box’ review: A mixed start for Amazon’s horror anthology,"The first two films from the streamer’s ‘Welcome to the Blumhouse’ are not straight horror as much as psychological thrillers

It is October and time for all the spooky stuff from Hollywood. On cue, Amazon Prime Video has dropped the first two films from its horror anthology, Welcome to the Blumhouse, The Lie and Black Box. The movies are not straight horror as much as psychological thrillers. While the former is anaemic and annoying, the latter is gloriously pulpy.

Written and directed by Veena Sud, The Lie is based on Sebastian Ko’s 2015 German film, We Monsters. Kayla, a troubled teenager, confesses to her divorced parents, Rebecca and Jay, that she impulsively killed her best friend, Britney. Rebecca, a successful corporate lawyer, and Jay, a musician, go down a rabbit hole of lies, deceit, deception, and do increasingly terrible things to protect their daughter. Peter Wunstorf’s cinematography brings out the icy cool of the bleak winter landscape as well as the sleek frostiness of Rebecca’s house.

The movie lurches along with the protagonists making inexplicable mistakes. If the concept is to show that regular people make blunders as covering up a murder is not their stock-in-trade, the mistakes should have been better thought out. And people with normal intelligence might make one mistake under stress, but they don’t pile them up—that just speaks of lazy writing. Also trying to shift the blame on the Pakistani neighbour was in very bad taste.

The Lie/ Black Box Director: Veena Sud/ Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour Jr.

Cast of The Lie: Mireille Enos, Peter Sarsgaard, Joey King

Cast of Black Box: Mamoudou Athie, Phylicia Rashad, Amanda Christine, Tosin Morohunfola, Troy James

Storyline of The Lie: When a teenager confesses a horrific crime to her parents, they do all they can to protect her

Story line of Black Box: A man loses his memory after an accident and tries a revolutionary experiment to get it back—only he cannot seem to recognise the man he was…

Run time: Around 100 minutes

Cast-wise, a pre-The Kissing Booth Joey King pouts annoyingly as Kayla while Peter Sarsgaard sails through as hipster dad, Jay. Mireille Enos puts in her all as the exceedingly wound-up Rebecca. At 97 minutes, The Lie just about manages to squeak past its expiry date.

Memory, identity and the tricks of the mind are quite the mainstay of science fiction and psychological thrillers. When Nolan, who loses his memory in the accident that killed his wife decides to go for Dr Brooks’ revolutionary treatment, all is not well. Nolan seems to remember things that go contrary to his gentle nature.

While the movie has some silly scenes, (that editor remembering Nolan’s dead wife’s writing just before telling him he is fired was hideously unbelievable), overall Black Box is good fun. When Dr Brooks puts the weird wire cap on Nolan’s head, you just wait for him to yell out “Cohaagen!” while a triple-breasted shady lady walks across the frame. (Total Recall, anyone?)

And then there is all that Inception echoes (hello, our protagonist is called Nolan) with analogue watches and safe rooms. Halfway through, there is an almighty twist that throws everything into a blender to create a jolly engaging film. Black Box is greatly helped by invested performances. Mamoudou Athie as tormented Nolan, Phylicia Rashad as the brilliant Dr Brooks and Amanda Christine as caring and cute Ava stand out.

The two films have whetted one’s appetite for the other two films in the anthology, Evil Eye, produced by Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Nocturne, which are dropping on October 13.

The Lie and Black Box are currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/wgd9nx/article32812759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/collage,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-lie-and-black-box-review-a-mixed-start-for-amazons-horror-anthology/article32812760.ece
129,2020/10/09,‘Long Way Up’ review: All about bromance and championing new-age technology,"Ewan McGregor and his longtime travel companion Charley Boorman take to the road once more in the third instalment of their docu-series — but this time, they are batting for the environment

Swing a leg over the saddle. With the back hunched slightly and arms resting on the handlebar, the push of a button brings a motorcycle to life. A gentle flick of the wrist sets off a chain of actions, all leading towards causing two wheels to spin.

With the wheels in motion, the surroundings gradually blur, leaving only a trail of road ahead for the eyes to follow. Roll the throttle and the bike gains speed, translating to a heightening of the senses each time. Riding then becomes a visceral experience.

The man and machine cease to be different objects. They fuse together and work in tandem. The machine, capable of acting on every command it receives, and the man, in absolute control over his actions.

During the process, there occurs a cleansing of senses, for they are devoted to just the job at hand. It is for a reason, Ewan McGregor, like many others, describe riding as a ‘meditating’ exercise.

However, Apple TV Plus’ Long Way Up, is not just about riding. Because, documenting Ewan McGregor and his longtime travel companion Charley Boorman as they journey through South America — covering 13,000 miles spread across 13 countries and 100 days — before arriving at Los Angeles, is only half the picture.

Armed with a flurry of cameras on their bikes and helmets, McGregor and Boorman capture everything on their way as they traverse a plethora of terrains from snow and glaciers to arid plains and misty mountains.

But, covering this distance on electric motorcycles to send across a message of sustainability is what sets the show apart from its predecessors Long Way Down and Long Way Round.

McGregor, a staunch believer of sustainable electricity, claims to have not used more power than he makes at his home or trailer. He is in the process of even getting his 1954 Volkswagen Beetle converted into electric. Along with Boorman, McGregor intends to turn this ride into a “frontier movement”; to show the world it is indeed possible to cover such long distances on electric bikes.

And this emphasis on sustainable power echoes throughout the journey. Their decision to go electric has strong ramifications that have to be weighed in. As a result, the whole of the first episode is devoted towards something grossly overlooked otherwise during travel: planning.

Soon, McGregor and Boorman, who have to cross areas as remote as the Atacama Desert and salt flats of Bolivia, realise they will have form their plan based on the location of charging stations along the route. This means they may have to jeopardise the most exciting aspect of a bike ride — the ability to do things on the spur of the moment.

Long Way Up Directors: David Alexanian and Russ Malkin

No. of episodes: 10

Starring: Ewan McGregor, Charley Boorman

Storyline: Two friends start out on a bike trip from the southern tip of South America to journey through 13 countries covering 13,000 miles to reach Los Angeles in North America in a span of 100 days

Yet, they persist with the plan and decide to set off from Ushuaia in Argentina on two electric bikes by Harley Davidson. Unsurprisingly, their first setback comes in the form of a delayed start as they refuse to chug along an over-sized charger on their motorcycles.

As the journey progresses, the charging woes only get compounded and they find themselves racing against time to catch a ferry; struggling to reach a hotel before nightfall lest they wade into the sub-zero temperatures of Argentinian nights; turning back mid-way because they fail to find charging points in isolated locations.

Though a tad repetitive, the predicaments are integral to the journey as the joy lies in watching McGregor and Boorman wriggle out of them. For Long Way Up is about these two discovering on the go about the working of sustainable power — both from their own experiences as well as through the people they meet on the road. It is also about how the natives, despite their geographical limitations, have already embraced renewables.

Watching McGregor and Boorman, two middle-aged men championing new-age technology, struggle to figure out the working of a satellite phone when they get stranded or fiddle with a camera before it can start recording, is another source of amusement.

With a 12V battery failing and the cameraman’s petrol bike running out of fuel, conventional technology take a hit too. But a small yet novel thing like a translator app, that merely requires people to speak into the phone, helps the duo make sense of Spanish works without fail.

Ultimately, Long Way Up is about all things modern, and two dear friends reveling in their bromance.

132,2020/10/09,This is Coenesque: on the Coen brothers and their influence on cinema,"On the Coen brothers and their influence on cinema and filmmakers like Dominik Moll and Kim Yong-hoon

As the fourth season of Fargo, starring comedian Chris Rock in a new avatar, bows this week, I couldn’t help but think back on the influence the film in general and the Coen brothers in particular had on some of the recent films I had watched.

I wondered idly why, unlike Tarantinoesque, the term Coenesque doesn’t exist. A cursory Google disabused me of that notion in microseconds. “Reminiscent of the films of Joel and Ethan Coen, known for their dark humour, genre-bending, mannered dialogue, and vivid sense of time and place,” is how that emporium of knowledge, Wiktionary, describes it.

Now we have that out of the way, let us proceed to filmmaker Dominik Moll, who first came to global attention in 2000 with Harry, He’s Here To Help, that was variously described as Hitchcockesque or Chabrolesque, after the French master of suspense. Working again with frequent writing collaborator Gilles Marchand, Moll created Only The Animals (2019), that is now available to digitally buy or rent in all the major global outlets. Apart from a beginning that looks parachuted in from another film, the movie can be described as Coenesque. There are vast snowy expanses, a la Fargo, and there is that now-popular-from-Nordic-noir trope of a missing woman outside a small village. The film is also divided into chapters with each one told from the point of view of a different character. Just when you think that all this looks depressingly familiar, Moll and Marchand take off the gloves and you’re in the middle of a thrillingly original ride. That beginning suddenly makes sense as later on in the film it expands to a stunning segment that is far removed from the bleak Coenesque landscape. And please watch it till the end of the end. There is a terrific twist in store. The film was nominated at France’s Cesars, Antalya and Venice and won a brace of awards at Tokyo.

A still from Beasts Clutching At Straws

Also Coenesque, if you will, is Korean filmmaker Kim Yong-hoon’s début feature, Beasts Clutching At Straws, that premièred at Rotterdam and won the special jury award. Based on a novel by Japanese writer Keisuke Kone, Yong-hoon adapted it to a Korean milieu. Having worked with leading Korean studio CJ E&M, he had access to and signed top stars Jeon Do-yeon, Jung Woo-sung and Youn Yuh-jeong. The focal point of the film is a bag full of cash and the lengths that a disparate range of characters with different needs go to obtain it. The trope is old, but the treatment is new. And this being modern Korean cinema, it revels in gore. Again, wait till the end of the end for a twist.

Meanwhile, after three decades of working together as a team, Joel Coen is making Macbeth on his own, without any involvement from Ethan Coen. Apparently Ethan just didn’t want to do it. Let’s hope that it is a temporary separation. Meanwhile, Macbeth, with a cast of Denzel Washington, Frances McDormand and Brendan Gleeson is a prospect in 2021 that we should not wash our hands off.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/c36er4/article32812028.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6c1b67d2-cd7f-4e34-8b38-cca0c99a4647-Fargo4011117r,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/on-the-coen-brothers-and-their-influence-on-cinema/article32812030.ece
133,2020/10/09,"Pixar’s ‘Soul’ bypasses theaters, will premiere on Disney+ for Christmas","The film, about a middle school teacher with dreams of becoming a jazz musician, was originally to premiere at Cannes, with a theatrical release scheduled for Nov. 20

The Pixar film “Soul” will skip theaters and instead premiere on Disney+ on Christmas, the Walt Disney Co. announced Thursday, sending one of the fall’s last big movies straight to streaming.

The move, widely expected after the recent exodus of most major upcoming releases, marks one of the final dominos to fall in Hollywood’s disastrous autumn. Following the exit of the James Bond film “No Time to Die” from November, the next big movie on the calendar is Warner Bros.’ “Wonder Woman 1984,” currently set for Dec. 25.

The successive delays of the film industry’s would-be blockbusters has only made the dire circumstances of movie theaters more acute. Earlier this week, Cinemark said it would again shutter the U.S. and U.K. locations of its Regal cinemas, the country’s second-largest theater chain.

On Thursday, the National Association of Theatre Owners, the trade group of exhibitors, said its #SaveYourCinema campaign has flooded Congress with more than 300,000 letters. Filmmakers including Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins have joined the campaign lobbying Congress to bring financial relief to theater owners. Without aid, the organization said, 69% of small and mid-sized movie theater companies will close or go bankrupt.

“The stark reality is that many movie theaters will not be able to open again if they don’t receive government help,” says Esther Baruh, director of government relations for the association. “This is as urgent as it gets.”

“Soul” will be available for Disney+ to subscribers at no further charge. Disney last month steered “Mulan” to its streaming service of 60 million-plus subscribers but charged $30 for early access.

Disney has been hit hard by the pandemic. It recently announced that it would lay off 28,000 workers, most of them at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, and Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. On Wednesday, the activist investor Daniel Loeb, founder of hedge fund Third Point, urged the company to more than double its budget for streaming content in a letter to Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek.

Expectation had been high for “Soul,” directed by Pete Docter, Pixar’s chief creative officer and the filmmaker behind “Up” and “Inside Out.” The film, about a middle school teacher (Jamie Foxx) with dreams of becoming a jazz musician, was originally to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. Its theatrical release had been scheduled for Nov. 20.

“The world can be an exhausting and frustrating place but it’s also full of unexpected joys, even in seemingly mundane things,” said Docter in a statement. “’Soul’ investigates what’s really important in our lives, a question we’re all asking these days. I hope it will bring some humor and fun to people at a time when everyone can surely use that.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/lajyfb/article32811711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/soul,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pixars-soul-bypasses-theaters-will-premiere-on-disney-for-christmas/article32811712.ece

Hindi movies Gulabo Sitabo and Shakuntala Devi emerged as the two most-watched movies since the launch of Prime Video in India. They were also the most watched Hindi movies on Prime Video globally, it was revealed.

Gaurav Gandhi, Director and Country General Manager, Amazon Prime Video India, said the learning from the previous slate helped them built on their playbook on marketing these films deep and wide.

“Our movies that were released in India were watched in over 4,000 thousand cities and towns, which is super deep, if you look at it from the context of how theatres do. And internationally as well, the fact that in a short period, they have been watched in over 180 countries, these are interesting facts.”

“In the case of many of our regional films — Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam — 50 per cent of the viewing came from outside the home states, which is quite unique for these films. What streaming can do for these films is to be able to give them a true national release and get customers from around the country to access the cinema,” Gandhi said.

138,2020/10/09,"Vishnu Purushan on his upcoming films, ‘Karnan Napoleon Bhagat Singh’ and ‘Pyali’","The Malayalam actor says he has done well for himself in the industry

Vishnu Purushan is upbeat about his upcoming Malayalam film Karnan Napoleon Bhagat Singh. Because Kunjoonu, the character he essays, brings in a vital twist to the plot.

“There is a lot of interest about the film as the title itself has generated curiosity. These are the names of four members of a club,” says Vishnu.

The thriller, with a strain of humour, directed by debutant Sarat G Mohan, is set for release. One of the songs from the film, ‘Sahyaana theerangalil…’ was released on YouTube recently.

Slated for release in April this year, the film was put on hold owing to the COVID 19 outbreak. “While we are looking for an OTT release, we are also hoping for a theatre release,” Vishnu says.

In five years, Vishnu has done 12 Malayalam films, 10 of which were released. “For someone who has a lot of love for cinema, I think I have done well for myself,” says the 25-year-old from Kakkanad, who always dreamt of acting.

Selected through an audition, Vishnu made his debut in Anil Radhakrishna Menon’s Lord Livingstone 7000 Kandi, as a tribal boy. But his role had to be edited out. Vishnu soon got a role in Sameer Thahir’s 2016-flick Kali starring Dulquer Salman. “It was a small, yet good role as a helper in villain Vinayakan’s tea shop,” he says.

He, however, was noticed in Guppy, as Christy, the close friend of the protagonist Michael played by Chetan Jayalal.

Vishnu also won acclaim for his role as Roopesh in the 2019-Tovino Thomas starrer Edakkad Battalion 06. “It was a prominent role for me, and perhaps the first time I got to play my age. I am usually always cast as someone much younger. The character was challenging as it had a negative shade,” says Vishnu, who is also looking forward to the release of Pyali, directed by Babita and Rinn and produced by NF Varghese Pictures, and Prateesh Uthaman’s short film Iruttu.

“Pyali is a children’s film and the role that I landed gave me immense opportunity to perform. I play a 24-year-old broker from Fort Kochi.” The film is in post production and is looking at a theatre release.

Iruttu a short film (horror-thriller) directed by Pratheesh Uthaman, is also set for release in December.

While he keeps working on himself as an actor, Vishnu says he sees himself directing films. “I want to be in films for as long as I can. Direction is my ultimate dream,” he says. Though he completed his Master’s in Malayalam from Bharat Mata College, Vishnu has not been able to write his exams because of attendance shortage. “For now, cinema occupies my mind. Many of us in the industry have to keep ourselves motivated in these COVID-19 times,” he signs off.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/l2gaju/article32810485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpvishnu2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-vishnu-purushan-talks-about-his-upcoming-films-karnan-napoleon-bhagat-singh-and-pyali/article32810489.ece
139,2020/10/09,HC asks Centre why Tamil was not included in the first instance,"Hearing a PIL plea, the court asks Centre to reply on Oct. 28

The Centre on Friday submitted before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that it had issued a corrigendum for the admission notice to Pandit Deenadayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology.

Postgraduation in Tamil and other classical languages had been included as minimum qualification to PG Diploma course in Archaeology, the Centre said.

Taking cognisance of the submission, a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi asked the Centre why it was not done so in the first instance itself. Though it was claimed that the omission was done inadvertently, it appeared to be deliberate, the court observed.

The court took serious note of the omission and put forth a series of questions to the Centre. It sought to know who was responsible for the omission and if any action was taken against the official concerned. The judges directed the Centre to submit its response on October 28.

The court also directed the Centre to furnish the details on languages that were enjoying ‘Classical Status’. The court hoped that caution would be exercised in such matters in future. The court was hearing the public interest litigation petition filed by S. Ramesh Kumar from Karaikudi, who challenged the Centre’s notification.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-asks-centre-why-tamil-was-not-included-in-the-first-instance-madurai/article32816007.ece

141,2020/10/09,"Pon. Radhakrishnan is frustrated, says Minister Kadambur Raju","‘Mr. Radhakrishnan was neither a national-level leader in the party nor the president of BJP’s State unit’

State Information Minister Kadambur C. Raju on Friday said former Union Minister Pon. Radhakrishnan was speaking against the BJP’s electoral alliance with the AIADMK out of extreme frustration.

According to him, the BJP and the people of Kanniyakumari (a constituency represented by Mr. Radhakrishnan in the past) have sidelined the former Union Minister. Mr Raju was responding to a question about Mr. Radhakrishnan’s recent remarks that the BJP would align with either the AIADMK or the DMK or even form a front under its leadership for the next Assembly polls in 2021.

Speaking to reporters at Kazhugumalai on Friday, Mr. Raju said Mr. Radhakrishnan was neither a national-level leader in the party nor the president of BJP’s State unit, which was being held by L. Murugan, who had clarified that the electoral alliance with the AIADMK was intact.

The Minister claimed as the Tamil Nadu government, led by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, was fulfilling all poll promises given by late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa during the 2016 election campaign and performing exceedingly well even to win accolades from the Prime Minister for his anti-COVID-19 operations, Mr. Murugan has also lauded the administration.

“Either the BJP high command or Mr. Murugan, in the capacity of the BJP’s State president, can say something on the electoral alliance. As they have backed the Tamil Nadu government, we need not give any importance to the views of Mr. Radhakrishnan, who is speaking out of frustration as both the BJP and the people of Kanniyakumari have sidelined him,” said Mr. Raju.

He also informed that the Chief Minister would visit Thoothukudi on October 13 for reviewing anti-COVID-19 operations and also the ongoing development works.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pon-radhakrishnan-is-frustrated-says-minister-kadambur-raju/article32814683.ece
142,2020/10/09,Emphasis on robust ecosystem of research and innovation at VIT convocation,"‘With advances in technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality, an increasing number of hybrid jobs could be foreseen’

As India aspires to grow and sustain a large and vibrant economy and uplift its society, one of the key elements to its successful realisation was to have a robust ecosystem of research and innovation, said K. Kasturirangan, former chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation and former chairman of National Educational Policy Committee.

Delivering the convocation address virtually at Vellore Institute of Technology’s (VIT) 35th annual convocation on Friday, he said that students should aspire for deepening and broadening their knowledge, learn to experience the power of collective teamwork and be guided by higher values which they believe in.

With advances in technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality, an increasing number of hybrid jobs where a person’s vocational skills would complement the capabilities of high-tech equipment could be foreseen, he said.

Higher education system was therefore necessary to prepare students for such jobs, he said, adding that vocational education would become an integral part of the larger vision of liberal education.

Noting that students from more than 50 countries were studying in VIT, G. Viswanathan, chancellor, said the Kasturirangan Education Policy Committee spoke about internationalisation as India needs to attract more students from foreign countries to its higher education institutions.

He said that many students went abroad for medical education due to scarcity of seats and hoped the Prime Minister would increase the availability of medical seats in the country. Among others, VIT vice presidents Sankar Viswanathan and Sekar Viswanathan were present.

143,2020/10/09,How the Nilgiris is battling COVID-19,"The containment strategy is working in the Nilgiris, says the District Collector

On October 7, 106 people tested positive, taking the total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Nilgiris to 4,940. While the easing of restrictions has led to a rising number of cases, the limited healthcare facilities in the mountainous district have so far been able to cope, says District Collector J. Innocent Divya. While raising awareness and dealing with economic difficulties remain pressing challenges, the lockdown has had unintended benefits for the ecology of the Nilgiris. Edited excerpts from an interview with Ananth Krishnan:

What is the present COVID-19 situation in the Nilgiris?

From the beginning, when COVID-19 started, we began our response early. We are at a very, very fragile location, at a trijunction, with Coimbatore, Karnataka and Kerala bordering us. We had to start early on. Before even the government had put in some restrictions, we ensured that tourist places were closed. So when Kerala was reporting a large number of cases, we had a manageable situation, and for the last few months, we kept it under control. But the recent easing of restrictions has affected us and [also] the fact that cases are increasing in Kerala, Karnataka and Coimbatore. So our numbers also keep increasing. We have no other alternative because our people are entirely dependent on these places for trade or commerce. It is a Catch-22 situation.

Our strategy is that we are trying to maintain strict perimeter control of these containment areas; ensuring SOPs are followed without any deviation for which we have special squads; ensuring face-mask wearing; and restricting entry by e-passes, which is helping us keep numbers in check. Of course, this does not apply to local residents, who do travel outside a lot, so cases are increasing. But right now, this containment strategy is working fine, and I am sure we will be able to reduce the numbers in the coming days.

What are the special challenges because of the geography of the Nilgiris?

One is our location at this trijunction, the other is access to medical facilities. As we don’t have so many private players, we are entirely dependent on the government machinery for healthcare. So that is one stress on the administration as well as on the health infrastructure, because the numbers are increasing. We are doing a delicate balancing act between those who require medical care, immediate medical support, and those who require less support in COVID-19 care centres. As far as COVID-19 care centres are concerned, we are very comfortable. We have a large number of facilities. But our medical infrastructure, I would say is, is where we are facing a stress. If the numbers start rising, that is when we will have to press the panic button, but right now we are okay. The Coimbatore infrastructure is helping us. In some cases, the ESI Hospital there is taking our patients who have 70% of their lungs infected, where they require immediate support. The other problem here is with a higher elevation, the oxygen saturation also keeps dipping. So for those patients who have a unstable saturation levels, we prefer to send them to Coimbatore.

Raising awareness among the public on mask-wearing has been a big challenge, because people start complaining they are not able to breathe, also because there are lower oxygen levels in the mountains. I think the period of awareness is over and the period of enforcement has begun. I don’t think anybody isn’t aware of the fact that if you don’t wear a mask in public, you are likely to get infected. We have also instituted fines, and it will have to sink into the minds of each and every one of the people so they have to have this feeling that when I go out on the road and I don’t have a mask, I will be fined or I will be severely penalised. The problem with fining is, the moment they see a government vehicle, then they will wear the masks properly. For people who complain about mask wearing, I have offered to arrange a free trip to the COVID-19 ward so they can see how people are fighting for breath. Then they will realise that a mask is nothing.

Given that tourism is a big source of revenue in Ooty and Coonoor especially, how bad has the economic impact been?

In the last five months, we have had absolutely no income from the tourism sector. From last month, we have started issuing e-passes for the tourists and opening up public parks like the Botanical Garden. We have been increasing the number of tourists passes, first we started with 50 and now we are processing 200 requests per day. So this way, we are trying to rejuvenate that sector, but also balancing with the medical infrastructure because any tourist who turns positive here will also have to be treated here.

For the tea sector, I would say we are very lucky because we restarted early on, when the northeast States were shut down. We just had four days of lockdown. The Chief Minister was kind enough to give us those orders that tea comes under the agriculture sector and as essential services. These few months have been a really watershed moment for the tea industry in the Nilgiris district to such an extent that the small growers have been benefited, so it has been a boon for the tea industry.

What has the pandemic meant for the longer term environmental challenges facing the Nilgiris, from preserving the shola forests to the animal population?

I think this is nature’s way of giving time because there was so much tourism, and other activities, in the hill district. Yes, we now have a focused strategy and approach towards COVID-19 but there is no lack of attention on the environment sector. For instance, even now, for tree-felling permissions, we are strictly ensuring 50% of the number of trees are replenished by native shola species. The district has a tiger, leopard and elephant population. The numbers are going up. If you go on the Mudumalai road now, it is common to see gaur with their calves, a situation I have never seen in the past three years that I have been here. It is not only a lack of tourism, but intervention to ensure their spaces that has created a positive impact on the population of these endemic species.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1zdi0h/article32814210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JINNOCENTDIVYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/how-the-nilgiris-is-battling-covid-19/article32814145.ece

The Directorate of Government Examinations has announced that the distribution of original mark certificates (marksheets) for students of Class 12 (Plus Two) who took up the exams in March 2020 will begin from October 14.

For students who have cleared all the subjects in the class 11 and 12 board exams alone, two separate original mark certificates for each class will be issued. The mark certificates will be out of 600 marks each, as per the new system.

145,2020/10/09,Tamil included for admission to diploma in archaeology,"In a corrigendum for its admission notice released on October 8, the Joint Director General of the Pt. Deenadayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology, has said that the qualification norms have been altered, including Tamil this time

After political parties in Tamil Nadu made an issue if it, the Pt. Deenadayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology has included a master’s degree in Tamil as a qualification for their postgraduate diploma course in Archaeology.

In a corrigendum for its admission notice released on October 8, the Joint Director General of the institute has said that the qualification norms have been altered, including Tamil this time.

As per the corrigendum, anyone with a master’s degree in all the classical languages notified by the government of India, that is -- Tamil, Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam,Odia and Pali, Prakrit, Arabic or Persian -- would qualify.

Madurai MP, Su. Venkatesan, who was the first to rake up the issue, has welcomed the move. “Injustice that attempted to render Tamil students unqualified and deny them entry into the Archaeological Survey of India at its very doorstep, has been thwarted,” he said. He recalled that several parties and organizations had condemned the ASI notice that did not include master’s degree in Tamil as a qualification for the two-year PG diploma course.

Subsequently, Chief Minister, Edappadi K. Palaniswami wrote to the Prime Minister on this issue, appealing him to include a PG degree in Tamil also in the list of qualified courses.

Among the qualifications listed for the diploma course were a master’s degree in Ancient or Medieval Indian History/Archaeology,/Anthropology, Indian Classical languages such as Sanskirt, Pali, Prakriti, Arabic or Persion or in Geology with knowledge of the Pleistocene age from a recognized university.

“It was Tamil Nadu that had raised its voice over the injustice against classical languages other than Sanskrit,” Mr. Venkatesan, a Communist Party of India (Marixst) MP said. He said that the ASI has announced its relaxation and now similarly, the Centre should dissolve the expert committee constituted by the Union Ministry of Culture to conduct a study on the origins and evolution of Indian culture. The announcement on the committee too drew flak, and the Chief Minister drew the attention of the Prime Minister over the composition of the committee that did not have any representative from the southern States.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-included-for-admission-to-diploma-in-archaeology/article32812887.ece
146,2020/10/09,Polytechnic colleges in Tamil Nadu lose out due to delay in admission process,"Government Polytechnic Colleges plan to call for a second round of counselling

Admission in polytechnic colleges has fallen abysmally this year in Tamil Nadu. In government polytechnic colleges, the admission is almost a fourth of the total intake. Self-financing and aided institutions have done only marginally better, teachers say.

Government Polytechnic Colleges are now planning to call for a second round of counselling in a bid to fill seats.

College principals cite two reasons for poor admission – centralised, online process and the delay in starting the counselling.

The principal of a college, which had an intake of around 400 students, said it received only a little over 100 applications. There are around 430 institutions, including 47 government colleges.

Fear of infection due to COVID-19 had forced the government to go for online application issuing and counselling. The polytechnic colleges were caught unprepared for online process. It was not as structured as the Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions. No effort was made to educate the parents or students about the process.

As a result many students did not upload the required documents, sometimes even their birth dates and certificates were not included, a teacher said. In the conventional counselling method the candidate would have been advised to return with the documents the next day.

“Students of class 10 are not tech savvy. It did not help that many parents also opted to send their students to government higher secondary schools instead of polytechnic colleges,” said a college principal.

Some government college principals said centralising the application process had caused the problem. “The application printing began two days after the release the exam results. With all students passing class 10 the parents also decided to send their children back to school. Usually poor performing students would apply for polytechnic courses. Even those who may have decided to drop out after class 10 decided to complete class 12 in government schools where they do not have to pay fees,” said the official.

College officials blame the Directorate of Technical Education’s inadequate handling of the admission process, which, they say, added to the uncertainty.

Fear of poor job prospects for engineering graduates also played a crucial part. “Courier organisations or food supplier chains do not want to hire candidates with engineering degrees. For these jobs a degree in Arts would suffice,” he added. With the government increasing the intake in government colleges more students were willing to pursue an Arts degree instead, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2zg5pj/article31965445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01-STUDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/polytechnic-colleges-in-tamil-nadu-lose-out-due-to-delay-in-admission-process/article32812076.ece

A police constable attached to the Armed Reserve (AR) was accused of asking about caste details to an individual for a mask violation case, in Perumanallur in Tiruppur district.

P. Sivakumar, a functionary of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi from Avinashi, said that he was driving a two-wheeler with his wife riding pillion in Perumanallur near Avinashi at around 1.30 p.m. on Thursday. “We just finished having lunch at a restaurant and I was not wearing a mask while driving, but my wife was wearing her mask,” he recalled on Friday. The two-wheeler was stopped by the AR constable Kasiraja, who asked for his particulars such as name and address for not wearing a mask.

Mr. Sivakumar alleged that the constable then proceeded to ask his caste, which he refused to disclose. He began recording a video of Mr. Kasiraja on his smartphone while having an argument, and circulated it on social media platforms on Thursday evening.

Baskar called the AR constable Mr. Kasiraja and two police constables attached to the Perumanallur police station, Nataraj and Veluchamy for an inquiry on Friday following the viral video.

Mr. Nataraj was at the spot along with the AR constable during the Thursday incident, while Mr. Veluchamy assigned the duty to them. Both these police constables were shifted to the AR on Friday, the officer said. Further disciplinary action will be initiated after the inquiry is completed, the officer said.

The Villupuram West Police on Thursday night arrested a 29-year-old woman on charges of murdering her three-month-old female baby by giving her milk laced with pesticide.

151,2020/10/09,Bars may take time to reopen,"Despite clearance from the government to reopen bars from October 1, many owners are taking their own time to reopen the bars.

A source in the Excise Department said many of the bars are taking time to reopen due to various reasons including time needed to clean up the premises after remaining closed for several months.

“Only a few liquor sale outlets-cum-bars have opened. Others want to wait for some more time before reopening,” the source said.

According to a bar owner, the traders are apprehensive about returns if they open the outlets with all restrictions in place. “Business is down in liquor shops due to the hike in excise duty imposed when IMFL outlets were allowed to function from May-end. Obviously, the price of liquor will be more in bars and the traders are not sure of getting customers,” the owner said. Some of the bars need more time to clean up their premises and procure new stock, he added.

154,2020/10/09,Hearing on DVAC inquiry into Secretariat complex construction to begin on November 19,"The Madras High Court on Thursday decided to commence on November 19 the final hearing on writ appeals filed against the quashing of a government order issued in September 2018 for a Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) inquiry into alleged irregularities in construction of a new Legislative Assembly-cum-Secretariat complex during the DMK regime.

First Division Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy fixed the date at the request of Advocate General Vijay Narayan and special senior counsel for State government AL. Somayaji who urged the court to take up the appeals, pending for last two years, for final hearing at an early date so that the cases could be disposed of.

Advocate R. Neelakandan, representing DMK president M.K. Stalin and the party’s general secretary Durai Murugan who were the Deputy Chief Minister and Public Works Department Minister respectively between 2008 and 2010 when the new Assembly complex was constructed, said he required time since senior counsel P. Wilson had to argue the case.

Immediately after the AIADMK came to power in 2011, the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa utilised the newly constructed building for establishment of a government super specialty hospital and also constituted a commission headed by former High Court judge R. Regupathi to probe into the irregularities in the construction of the Assembly complex.

The inquiry was conducted against former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, Mr. Stalin and Durai Murugan. However, in August 2018, Justice S.M. Subramaniam directed the State government to suspend the Commission of Inquiry and instead institute criminal prosecution against the suspects if it was satisfied of a prima facie case having been made out.

Accordingly, the Government decided not to revive the Commission of Inquiry and issued a G.O. on September 24, 2018 ordering a DVAC inquiry into the alleged irregularities. In December 2018, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana quashed the G.O. and hence the present appeals. Mr. Stalin and Mr. Durai Murugan too had filed separate appeals challenging Justice Subramaniam’s order.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hearing-on-dvac-inquiry-into-secretariat-complex-construction-to-begin-on-november-19/article32808301.ece

156,2020/10/09,Election petition against P. Chidambaram nearing disposal,"An election petition, pending in the Madras High Court for the last 11 years, challenging the victory of former Union Minister P. Chidambaram from the Sivaganga parliamentary constituency in May 2009, is nearing disposal. Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana on Thursday commenced hearing final arguments on the petition.

Advocates Rajendrakumar and G. Saravanakumar argued on behalf of petitioner R.S. Rajakannappan, who contested the 2009 election as an AIADMK candidate but recently joined the DMK.

After hearing them, the judge posted the case to Monday for hearing senior counsel G. Masilamani and R. Thiagarajan for Mr. Chidambaram.

The petitioner had lost to the former Union Minister by a margin of 3,354 votes. Then, he had accused the returned candidate of manipulating the vote counting process.

In his election petition, he alleged that the Returning Officer had illegally added the votes secured by him in the Alangudi Assembly segment into the kitty of Mr. Chidambaram. If such illegality had not occurred, the petitioner was confident of having won the seat by a margin of 7,034 votes. He also claimed that AIADMK cadres had agitated against the illegal decision right at the counting centre but they were beaten up by the police. The election petition was also filed on the ground of bribing of voters.

However, Mr. Chidambaram stoutly denied all allegations levelled against him and termed them to be a figment of imagination of the petitioner. He also stood his ground during elaborate cross examination by the counsel for the petitioner.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/election-petition-against-p-chidambaram-nearing-disposal/article32808285.ece

Expressing shock over the death of Lok Janshakti Party leader, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said, “My heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.”

DMK president M.K. Stalin said, “Heartfelt condolences to Chirag Paswan and his family on the demise of Thiru Ram Vilas Paswan, Founder of @LJP4India and Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution. Indian politics has lost a dynamic leader today.”

MDMK founder Vaiko said that Mr. Paswan cared about Sri Lankan Tamils. “He sought justice for them in Parliament and said that a separate Tamil Eelam is the solution. He also came and participated in the commemorative event in Marina beach organised by May 17 Movement. He lived his life for the oppressed,” he said.

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri said, “Mr. Paswan fought for the rights of Dalits and his untimely death has come at a time when his party is getting ready to contest the Bihar Assembly election alone. It is a big loss. I offer my condolences to his son and party members.”

PMK founder S. Ramadoss said Mr. Paswan was one of his closest friends among politicians active in national politics. “He has participated in several events organised by the Pattali Makkal Katchi in Tamil Nadu and New Delhi, including an event in 1992 for Tamil Rights Conference.”

“Deeply saddened to hear about the demise of Lok Janshakti Party President and Hon'ble Union Minister #Ram Vilas Paswan. A veteran leader, he will be remembered for his work to emancipate Dalits and the downtrodden. My heartfelt condolences to his bereaved family,” tweeted VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan.

Puthiya Tamilagam founder Krishnasamy said he was saddened to know about the death of his friend, Mr. Paswan, who has been Union Minister and the voice of the original inhabitants of India in Parliament. “He has been an important part of Indian politics for over 50 years.

158,2020/10/09,CM writes to PM on archaeology admission,"Of the 48,000 inscriptions, 28,000 are in Tamil language, he says

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to direct the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to amend its guidelines to include the postgraduate degree in Tamil language as one of the minimum qualifications for admission to PG diploma in archaeology in Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology.

In his letter, a copy of which was released to the media, Mr. Palaniswami referred to an advertisement for admission to the PG diploma course in archaeology for 2020-2022 at the institute and pointed out: “There are about 48,000 inscriptions in all the languages that have been published so far by various agencies in India, including the Archaeological Survey of India, of which more than 28,000 inscriptions (which is over half) are in Tamil language alone.”

While it was a laudable initiative to create a suitable talent pool in a consistent manner that will unravel the country’s glorious past in a professional way, some of the guidelines served as “entry barriers for the aspirants across the country especially for people from Tamil Nadu”, he contended.

The minimum qualification criteria prescribed was a Master’s degree in, among other relevant subjects, Indian classical languages such as Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, Arabic or Persian, he said. “Unfortunately, among the listed languages, only Sanskrit has been declared as a classical language in 2005. Furthermore, Tamil, which was the first language in India officially recognised as a classical language in 2004, has been completely ignored,” he underlined.

Keeping in view the above facts, the admission process could be made more inclusive, Mr. Palaniswami advocated and sought the Prime Minister’s early intervention in this regard.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cm-writes-to-pm-on-archaeology-admission/article32808188.ece
159,2020/10/09,"Fee for students at TNAU-affiliatedcolleges fixed at ₹50,000 per annum","Government accepts recommendations made by retired HC judge K. Chandru

The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday fixed ₹50,000 per annum as the overall fee for students (both for those admitted through counselling and through management quota) in colleges affiliated to the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), accepting the recommendations made by retired High Court judge K. Chandru.

This is also the first time that students admitted through counselling (government quota) and management quota have to pay the same fee. “The Supreme Court has said there should not be any difference between students admitted through counselling and those admitted through management quota,” Justice K. Chandru told The Hindu.

The committee, after taking into account the overall circumstances, also observed that any kind of fee under different heads such as special fee, library fee, laboratory fee, audio-visual education fee, games fee, computer fee, National Cadet Corps/National Service Scheme (NCC/NSS) fee, sports fee, guest lectures fee, cultural event fee and placement and competitive fee that was being collected, “is prohibited”.

The overall fee of ₹50,000 per annum for two semesters would be allowed to be paid either completely for the year or in two instalments — one payment for each semester, the State government said in a G.O. issued on Thursday.

The private colleges affiliated to the TNAU shall be allowed to collect a one-time fee of ₹5,000 towards caution deposit apart from the fee fixed per annum, which should be refunded when the student leaves the institution.

“It is made clear that other than the fee and the caution deposit, no other fee of any kind shall be collected,” the G.O., issued by Agriculture Secretary Gagandeep Singh Bedi, stated.

In line with the retired judge’s recommendations, the State government has decided to consult the TNAU Registrar on other allied matters, including hostel and mess fee. It would also examine the committee’s recommendation in regard to payment of the fee for 2020-21 academic year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fee-for-students-at-tnau-affiliatedcolleges-fixed-at-50000-per-annum/article32808174.ece
160,2020/10/09,HC seeks report on steps takento identify homeless destitutes,"Petitioner says concept of temporary shelters for homeless is absent in the State

The Madras High Court on Thursday called for a report from the State government on steps taken to identify hundreds of homeless destitutes, who live on roadsides and street corners, and provide them food and shelter, especially during the ensuing monsoon period.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha also directed the Greater Chennai Corporation to file a similar affidavit by November 5 since public interest litigation petitioner M. Muruganantham told the court that not less than 20,000 people were homeless and destitutes in the city limits alone.

The judges wanted to know the methodology adopted by the government as well as the civic bodies for identifying the homeless people, the availability of temporary shelters to house them during rainy and winter season and the amount of funds that had been allocated for the same.

The interim order was passed on the PIL petition that had been pending in the court since 2018. The litigant had claimed that the concept of temporary shelters for the homeless was completely absent in the State, forcing those people to brave cold and rains.

It was also brought to the notice of the Bench that the Supreme Court had taken up a similar case in 2016 and constituted a committee headed by retired Delhi High Court judge Kailash Gambhir to verify whether the urban homeless had been provided with shelters.

The committee had also been ordered to inquire into the slow progress in establishing such shelters under the National Urban Livelihoods Missions and the possibility of non-utilisation, diversion or misappropriation of funds allotted to the State governments, the petitioner said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vwx0xh/article32808160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUSCOVID19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-seeks-report-on-steps-takento-identify-homeless-destitutes/article32808161.ece
161,2020/10/09,Hold Centre accountable for non-payment of GST compensation: Stalin,"Thanks CM for declining borrowing options

DMK president M.K. Stalin has written to Chief Ministers of 10 States - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Kerala, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Delhi, Jharkhand and West Bengal urging them to hold the Centre accountable for the non-payment of GST compensation to the States.

In the letter, Mr. Stalin thanked the Chief Ministers on behalf of the people of Tamil Nadu for declining to accept both borrowing options proposed by the Union government at the GST Council meeting held on October 5. Appreciating the Chief Ministers for upholding federalism, Mr. Stalin said the Centre had a moral and legal obligation to pay compensation to the States and its proposal that the States borrow to meet their revenue shortfall was a travesty of the rights of the States and justice

“Further, the CAG report for the fiscal year 2018-19 shows the Union government had illegitimately transferred ₹47,272 crore from the GST compensation fund to the Consolidated Fund of India during 2017-18 and 2018-19. The possibility of such illegitimate transfers for the past fiscal year [2019-20] remains,” he said.

‘Wrongful actions’

Mr. Stalin said that according to the CAG report, the Centre admitted to such wrongful actions and promised to correct them by depositing the money back into the GST compensation fund from the Consolidated Fund.

“In light of these facts, I urge you to ensure that the Union government will stick to its commitment to the CAG, reimburse this amount immediately and initiate compensation payments to the States from this deposit. The additional funds required to honour the Union’s Legal Obligations for the year can be borrowed from the market or the RBI and credited directly into the compensation fund, with the Union government serving as a guarantor for their repayment,” he said.

He also accused the Tamil Nadu government of betraying the people on the issue.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fygctr/article32808107.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09STALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hold-centre-accountable-for-non-payment-of-gst-compensation-stalin/article32808108.ece

163,2020/10/09,Upbeat AIADMK launches a poster campaign,"Cadre pit Stalin against Palaniswami

A day after the AIADMK announced Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its electoral face for the 2021 Assembly polls, party functionaries were upbeat and put up posters pitting Mr. Palaniswami against DMK president M.K. Stalin, in various places, though the election is months away.

In fact, the AIADMK’s IT wing launched its social media campaign for Mr. Palaniswami on Wednesday itself, extolling his political “achievements”.

One such poster asked “Seyal nayagana, arikai nayagana” alluding to Mr. Palaniswami as a “performer” and Mr. Stalin as one who “issues only statements”.

“Earlier, there was no necessity for the AIADMK or the DMK to name a Chief Ministerial candidate. But now, there is such a necessity, and with the official announcement coming from our party coordinator, what else do we need? It is natural for us to work for the victory of our party,” said AIADMK spokesperson R.M. Babu Murugavel on the publicity work.

But isn’t it too early for a poster war? “Seven months will just fly by. A winning party will always work and not wait for an election, to wake up at the eleventh hour. Moreover, our government has done so much for the people and we have content for posters. If the DMK president speaks at two public meetings, we will have content for the campaign for two years,” said Mr. Murugavel, who is also the joint secretary of the party’s legal wing.

According to him, the party is poll-ready. “Only today, our district secretaries obtained approval from District Collectors for our booth-level agents. We are all ready,” he said.

The DMK, however, appears to be waiting. DMK spokesperson J. Constantine Ravindran said his party was not bothered by the AIADMK naming its CM candidate. “How does it matter who is the captain of the ill-fated Titanic, which is set to sink?” he asked cryptically. He felt the posters were only meant to project Mr. Palaniswami as the AIADMK candidate to the general public.

Mr. Ravindran recalled that when AIADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran was the Chief Minister, a member of his Cabinet had said that only MGR was “number one” and others were “zeroes”. The Ministers behaved similarly when Jayalalithaa was the Chief Minister. “Now, these zeroes have decided to become number one. That is how we see the developments. We are least bothered as to what happens in the AIADMK,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gahm7j/article32808039.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9THPALANISWAMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/upbeat-aiadmk-launches-a-poster-campaign/article32808040.ece

The Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Chennai Central railway station and Tiruchi junction are among dozens of major railway stations across the country that are yet to comply with the green norms stipulated under various statutory rules of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

A joint inspection by CPCB and Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) officials at the Central and Tiruchi railway stations in the Southern Railway, recently, revealed that both stations had not got the necessary approvals under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, the Air (Prevention and Control of Air Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

With the National Green Tribunal directing the authorities concerned to ensure that the green norms are complied with, in a stipulated timeframe, the Ministry of Railways has written to general managers of all zonal railways to take immediate steps to comply with the CPCB guidelines, as regards environment management, particularly waste water and solid waste management.

The officials were told to obtain statutory approvals to meet safe environment standards from the competent authority.

The Central railway station, with a footfall of 1,57,074 a day and 54 originating/passing-through trains, had not obtained the consent of pollution control authorities, under the Water Act and the Air Act, for a solid waste processing facility, and plastic waste, e-waste and battery-waste disposal.

Inspecting officials recommended that a waste-to-energy plant be installed, and till then, suggested the provision of any treatment facility to manage wet waste (organic waste) and stop handing it over to the Chennai Corporation. Noise level checks were carried out at four locations, for half-an-hour, and the findings were found to be higher.

In Tiruchi too, the report said consent from pollution control authorities was not obtained under relevant provisions. The junction, with a footfall of 49,744 people a day, has 139 trains passing through the station and 33 trains originating from there. Among the recommendations for Tiruchi were installation of a waste-to-energy plant, provision of adequate rainwater harvesting structures to recharge groundwater in the area and installation of electromagnetic flow meters at various sources of generation of waste water and at the inlet/outlet of the water recycling plant.

Southern Railway spokesperson said the process of getting necessary approvals was under way.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/central-tiruchi-among-stations-yet-to-comply-with-green-norms/article32808006.ece
165,2020/10/09,"After 40 days, 99-year-old awaits her return home","‘It helped that she came to the hospital at the right time’

“I have been on room air for three days. Can I go home?” Jeyalakshmi asks her doctors at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). After spending 40 days in the hospital, including a number of days in the intensive care unit, the 99-year-old, who is on the road to recovery from COVID-19, is eagerly waiting to return home.

“It was surprising that she knew so much about the discharge criteria for COVID-19 patients — managing on room air for three days. A crucial factor that paved the way for her recovery was that she came to the hospital at the right time. She had mild symptoms and was admitted to the hospital on August 29. But three days later, the infection started to progress. But she was already under medical supervision, and, so, was taken care of,” said E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH.

Admitted with complaints of fever, nausea and abdominal pain, the nonagenarian’s first chest X-ray showed no findings, though she had tested positive for COVID-19. However, she went on to develop respiratory distress. “Her condition started to worsen. All inflammatory markers were elevated, and we started the required line of management. She required oxygen support, but was not maintaining saturation on a non-rebreathing mask (NRM) and high-flow nasal cannula. In high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), we can provide up to 70 litres of oxygen, but she was unable to withstand it. We then moved to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (C-PAP) therapy and she was on the C-PAP machine for five days,” he said.

A repeat X-ray showed bilateral extensive lung involvement. She was treated with remdesivir, steroids and vitamin supplements.

She started showing signs of stablisation, after which she was sequentially weaned to HFNO and NRM. “Now, we are providing intermittent oxygen supply, especially at night. She is stable, maintaining SPO2 95-96 on room air,” Dr. Theranirajan added.

On Thursday, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, who was on a visit to RGGGH, met Ms. Jeyalakshmi. She will be discharged in a few days, doctors said. Officials said that so far, 21 persons aged over 90 had been discharged from RGGGH, after treatment for COVID-19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/v5v9mr/article32807974.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201008-WA0023,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/after-40-days-99-year-old-awaits-her-return-home/article32807975.ece
166,2020/10/09,"Have you stopped insisting on e-pass, HC asks govt.","There is no clarity on the issue so far, say judges

The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to clarify by Friday as to whether the requirement of people having to obtain e-passes for both intra-State and inter-State travel to contain the spread of COVID-19 had been given up or not.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed State government pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan to obtain instructions from the authorities concerned and inform the court since there was no clarity on the issue so far.

The direction was issued during the hearing of a writ petition filed last month challenging the State government’s August 31 lockdown extension order, which stated that the insistence on obtaining e-passes for travel would continue for one more month in Tamil Nadu.

The petitioner, K.R. Ezhil Nadhi, contended that such insistence on e-passes amounted to curtailing the free movement of citizens. It was also argued that the State government had no authority to do so since the Union Home Ministry had permitted travel without e-passes.

Lockdown extension

When the case was listed again on Thursday, petitioner’s counsel told the court that the State government had issued yet another order on September 30, extending the limited lockdown by one more month. However, this order had no mention of e-passes.

Therefore, nothing much would survive for adjudication in the writ petition, if the State government informs the court that it had stopped insisting upon e-passes for travel, he said.

The State government pleader urged the court to grant him some time to obtain instructions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/x9yib5/article32807952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9THHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/have-you-stopped-insisting-on-e-pass-hc-asks-govt/article32807953.ece
167,2020/10/09,Two Tangedco workers convicted for bribery,"Duo asked for a bribe to transfer supply

The Special Court Judge K. Mohan found S. Kubendiran, Junior Engineer (JE), and P. Vijayakumar, Foreman, Grade I of Kallakurichi taluk, guilty and convicted them. The Judge ordered Mr. Kubendiran to undergo four years imprisonment and pay a fine of ₹5,000. The Judge also ordered Mr. Vijayakumar to undergo three years imprisonment and pay a fine of ₹5,000.

According to the prosecution, the complainant, Dhanabal from Kuduraichandal near Kallakurichi, approached the office of the JE on January 23, 2014, demanding transfer of his farm power connection. The duo demanded a bribe of ₹3,500 from him Mr. Dhanabal for the transfer of the connection.

168,2020/10/09,₹16 crore recovered from accounts of ineligible beneficiaries under scheme,"PM-KISAN Nidhi scheme aims to give ₹6,000 a year in three instalments to farmers who own up to two hectares of land

The Department of Agriculture has recovered ₹16 crore credited into the bank accounts of over 50,000 ineligible beneficiaries under the PM-KISAN Nidhi scheme in Villupuram district so far.

A senior official said that out of the 1,60,000 ineligible beneficiaries, as many as 1,10,000 were from Villupuram district, while 50,000 were from other districts.

The scheme, conceived in 2018, aims to give ₹6,000 a year in three instalments to farmers who own up to two hectares of cultivable land.

Official sources said that while the first phase of registration of beneficiaries went off smoothly, the discrepancies came to light only in the subsequent phases after March. The Department has terminated the services of 11 contractual staff for conniving with middlemen and private computer service centres for enrolment of ineligible beneficiaries, the official added.

Probe widened

Sources from the Crime-Branch CID said that the ongoing probe was now widened and the role of officials at the block-level in enumerating ineligible beneficiaries without exercising due diligence was being looked into in detail.

“The probe also revealed that around 25 persons in each block were responsible for the enrolment of ineligible beneficiaries. More arrests are likely as the CB-CID team is investigating the role of officials and contractual staff in all the 12 blocks in the district,” an officer said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/16-crore-recovered-from-accounts-of-ineligible-beneficiaries-under-scheme/article32807731.ece
169,2020/10/09,Sugar cane growers demand settlement of dues,"Association also seeks amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code

The Federation of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry State Private Sugarmill Cane Growers’ Associations has urged the Union Government to take steps to ensure payment of dues totalling ₹65 crore owed by four private sugar mills — two in Cuddalore district and one each in Thanjavur and Nagapattinam districts to farmers.

In a memorandum addressed to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, K.S. Venkatesan, secretary of the association, said that the delay in settling dues had left hundreds of farmers in Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Thanjavur districts in distress.

He said that Ambika Sugar Mills at Chittoor and Thiru Arooran Sugar Mills at Thirumandakudi and Kottur were yet to settle dues to cane growers who had supplied sugar cane to the mills over the last four years.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has already initiated insolvency proceedings against the four mills based on petitions filed by banks. This has confirmed the fear of farmers that they will no longer get the pending dues, he said.

The Association also demanded that an amendment be made in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to change the status of cane growers from operational creditors to priority creditors.

The Tamil Nadu Government has already sent a proposal in favour of the amendment to the Centre.

The Union Government has the responsibility to protect the welfare of farmers. Hence, it should immediately intervene and ensure settlement of pending dues to farmers, Mr. Venkatesan added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/t4lee5/article32807676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TH-LT-SUGARCANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sugar-cane-growers-demand-settlement-of-dues/article32807677.ece
170,2020/10/09,Police to visit villages for inquiry in four districts,"A head constable will undertake initial investigations

The north zone police have asked all police stations to hold petition inquiry in the respective village or house of the complainant. The move is aimed at reviving traditional policing and to prevent overcrowding at police stations.

There are about 90 police stations in Vellore, Tirupathur, Ranipet and Tiruvannamalai districts. “Earlier, once a complaint is received, the petitioner and the counter-petitioner used to be summoned to the station for inquiry. Now, we will send a head constable to the village of the complainant first for preliminary investigation and then the inspector or sub-inspector will carry out questioning and solve the issue at the earliest,” said N. Kamini, DIG, Vellore Range.

She said this would not only help solve cases fast, it would also reduce crowding at police stations and help policemen build a rapport with villagers. “Apart from attending to complaints, they can check on history sheeters in the locality, conduct awareness programmes, build a rapport with villagers and earn their trust. This is how it was done earlier,” she added.

The initiative was being implemented as per the instructions given by Rajesh Das, ADGP, and P. Nagarajan, IG, North Zone. “This will be done in all women police stations too,” added Ms. Kamini.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/police-to-visit-villages-for-inquiry-in-four-districts/article32807634.ece
171,2020/10/09,Polytechnic colleges in Tamil Nadu lose out due to delay in admission process,"Only one fourth of the seats filled up, says principal

The number of students joining polytechnic colleges has been abysmally low this year. In government polytechnic colleges, the admission is almost a fourth of the total intake. Self-financing and aided institutions have done only marginally better, teachers say.

College principals cite two reasons for poor admission – centralised, online process and the delay in starting the counselling.

The principal of a college, which had an intake of around 400 students, said it received only a little over 100 applications. There are around 430 institutions, including 47 government colleges.

Fear of infection due to COVID-19 had forced the government to issue applications and conduct counselling online. The polytechnic colleges were unprepared for the online process. It was not as structured as the Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions. No effort was made to educate the parents or students about the process either.

As a result, many students did not upload the required documents, sometimes even their birth dates and certificates were not included, a teacher said. In the conventional counselling method the candidate would have been advised to return with the documents the next day.

“Students of class 10 are not tech savvy. More over, many parents also opted to send their students to government higher secondary schools instead of polytechnic colleges,” said a college principal.

Some government college principals said centralising the application process had caused the problem. “The application printing began two days after the release of the exam results. With all students passing class 10, the parents also decided to send their children back to school. Usually poor performing students would apply for polytechnic courses. Even those who may have decided to drop out after class 10 decided to complete class 12 in government schools where they do not have to pay fees,” said the official.

College officials blame the Directorate of Technical Education’s inadequate handling of the admission process, which, they say, added to the uncertainty.

Fear of poor job prospects for engineering graduates also played a crucial part. “Courier organisations or food supplier chains do not want to hire candidates with engineering degrees. For these jobs, a degree in arts would suffice,” he added. With the government increasing the intake in government colleges more students were willing to pursue an arts degree instead, he added.

Government Polytechnic Colleges are now planning to call for a second round of counselling in a bid to fill seats.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/polytechnic-colleges-in-tamil-nadu-lose-out-due-to-delay-in-admission-process/article32807590.ece
172,2020/10/09,HC permits govt. to go ahead with auctioning of lands for mining black granite,"The Madras High Court on Thursday permitted the State government to go ahead and confirm in favour of the highest bidders the recent auctioning of various government lands in Dharmapuri district for mining black granite.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha also permitted the government to ask the highest bidders to submit mining plans, get them approved and then obtain environment clearance too in accordance with existing rules.

The permission was granted at the request of Advocate General Vijay Narayan who said the State government would end up losing hundreds of crores of rupees in foreign exchange and also employment opportunities for many if the auctions were stalled.

The A-G urged the court to modify an interim order passed by another Division Bench on September 30 restraining the government from confirming the auction. He said only if the auctions were confirmed the consequent process of environment clearance could be taken up.

The interim order was passed on a couple of public interest litigation petitions which insisted that environmental clearance must be obtained even before deciding to auction the lands. They also relied upon central government guidelines to substantiate their case.

However, Mr. Narayan told the court that the guidelines cited by the petitioners were related to ease of doing business and had nothing to do with environment. He said the onus of obtaining environmental clearance was upon the successful bidders now as per existing rules.

The Centre wanted a change in such a procedure and go for a pre-embedded clearance where lands could be leased out to the miners after obtaining all statutory clearances. This guideline of the Centre had absolutely nothing to do with environment, he said.

Pointing out that one of the two PIL petitioners, who had challenged the tender notifications, was former Member of Parliament R. Thamaraiselvan, the A-G said: “It is a bit unfair on the part of the former MP to make it an environment issue.”

After hearing him at length, the Bench led by Justice Sathyanarayanan modified the interim order passed by the previous bench and permitted the government to go ahead with all other process except for executing the lease deeds and handing over the lands to the lessors.

They also said that the PILs would be taken up for final hearing on November 3. The senior judge in the Bench said sustainable development should be the mantra in the country where both development as well as environment protection must happen together.

We have several mouths to feed,” the judge told the counsel for the petitioners.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-permits-govt-to-go-ahead-with-auctioning-of-lands-for-mining-black-granite/article32807554.ece

174,2020/10/09,Tension as officials attempt ‘forceful’ vacation of village,"Subsequently, vllagers given time till Dasara, as requested

Tension prevailed for some time at Errvalli in Kondapaka mandal on Friday when officials and police reached the village with heavy force, directing the villagers to vacate.

The village will get submerged by Mallannasagar along with some other villages.

According to sources, a large number of police and revenue staff reached the village in the morning and asked the villagers to vacate, stating that they would be provided accommodation at Mutrajpally near Gajwel town. However, the villages refused to vacate, saying some villagers were yet to get compensation and package. There was a heated argument between villagers and officials.

The officials promised to address the pending issues. They visited every house and collected details of pending compensation and package. They said the issue would be presented to the Collector and addressed immediately.

Some villagers told the officials that they would vacate only after Dasara as they wanted to celebrate the last festival in the village and play Bathukamma.

The officials promised to give them time till the festival was over.

“We have postponed our decision to get the village vacated as per their request. The double bedroom units are ready for house-warming,” K.

175,2020/10/09,Bathukamma saris’ distribution begins,"Introduction of 187 varieties makes the programme special this time

The State government launched its annual distribution of saris to poor women for Bathukamma festival, beginning on October 17, with fanfare on Friday.

Just as last year, one crore saris will be distributed but what makes the programme different this time was introduction of an additional 187 varieties. Ministers, MLAs and other leaders formally inaugurated the programme taken up at a cost of ₹318 crore.

The cost went up this year from ₹295 crore last year as the government introduced gold and silver colours in the zari of the saris. Only gold colour was added to zari last year.

According to Mr. V. Ashok Rao, Assistant Director of Handlooms and Textiles at Sircilla where the entire production of saris in huge bundles began six months ago, women of below-the-poverty-line families will get saris in 287 varieties as against 100 last year. The saris were produced in 20 colours.

About 15,000 workers were employed day and night on 25,000 powerlooms in the town.

They were assured of an income of ₹16,000 to ₹25,000 per month.

The government had launched the programme in 2017 but it was only from the following year that the bundles of 15 to 16 saris each were produced in toto in Sircilla. Since only four months were available for production in the first year, 50% of saris were outsourced from manufacturing facilities in Surat.

The programme was taken up by government with the twin objectives of gifting saris to poor women and providing employment to powerloom workers at hundreds of `sanchas', as sheds in Sircilla housing the looms are called.

Mr. Ashok Rao said seven crore metres of cloth was produced locally from which 90 lakh saris of 6.3-metre length and 10 lakh saris of 9-metre length were made. Each sari will have a blouse piece of 80 centimetres.

The 9-metre saris were meant for women adopting Maharashtrian culture in border areas of the State.

The programme was handled by Telangana State Handlooms Cooperative Society right from placing orders, selecting varieties and designs, procurement from looms and supply to districts.

The cost of 6.3-metre sari worked out to ₹300 while it was ₹330 for 9-metre saris.

The society began dispatch of cloth from Sircilla to processing units in Hyderabad in July.

The cloth underwent heating in water, cutting and packing at Hyderabad.

After the formal launch on Friday, distribution committees comprising panchayat secretaries, fair price shop dealers and representatives of women groups will either take up door delivery or distribute with COVID-19 precautions at gram panchayat buildings.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bathukamma-saris-distribution-begins/article32816457.ece
176,2020/10/09,Nizamabad MLC election peaceful,"All eyes on Kavitha

The much anticipated Legislative Council election from the local bodies constituency of erstwhile Nizamabad district passed off peacefully on Friday with 823 out of the 824-member electoral college, comprising MPTC and ZPTC members and municipal councillors and corporators, exercising their franchise.

Officials said 821 elected representatives cast their votes while two others used postal ballot facility due to COVID. Only one vote was not cast and it apparently was of a councillor from Bodhan municipality who passed away recently.

Polling booths were set up in Nizamabad and Kamareddy. While Kamareddy saw 100% voting with all the 341 voters casting their votes and in Nizamabad out of the 483 voters 480 turned up.

About 20 voters affected with COVID were given permission to cast votes in the last hour and they came wearing PPE kits to the polling station. Counting will be taken up on October 12 and the result will be declared on the same day itself if everything goes smoothly.

The election assumed significance with Chief Minister’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha in the race as TRS candidate. She emerged as a favourite going by the fortunes of the ruling party and the Opposition on the basis of their support base. Subhash Reddy is the Congress candidate while Potankar Laxminaranayana is contesting on BJP’s ticket.

Prominent leaders who voted in these elections include the Assembly Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy; Housing Minister Vemula Prashant Reddy; MLAs Ganesh Bighala, Bajireddy Govardhan, A. Jeevan Reddy and BJP MP of Nizamabad Arvind Dharmapuri.

Camp politics was in full swing for the elections as all the voters were shifted to various resorts by political parties fearing defections in the last moment. Most of them were brought back to Nizamabad on Thursday night while some others landed on Friday morning.

The elections were to be held in April this year after the vacancy was created due to the disqualificationn of the sitting MLC R. Bhoopathi Reddy. He joined the Congress just before the elections after getting elected on TRS ticket, and was subsequently declared disqualified. The polling was scheduled to be held on April 7 but was postponed due to the lockdown announced by the Central government to tackle the COVID19 pandemic.

If Ms. Kavita wins, going by the trends, it will be a comeback for her into Nizamabad politics after her defeat in the last Parliament elections to BJP’s Arvind Dharmapuri.

So far, the mortgage was to be made from the ground to second floors of the building.

According to a clause of the building rules, the builder is required to hand over 10% of the total built-up area, in the ground or first or second floors to the sanctioning authority, for issue of building permissions.

The property will be released only after the authorities ensure that there are no deviations from the sanctioned plan, before issuance of occupancy certificate.

There have been representations to the government from developers, saying that some times the owners who hand over the properties for development are unwilling to hand over their share for mortgage.

Owners usually opt for lower floors of the structure as their share owing to saleability factors, and this poses problem for the builders.

A 20-year-old man, S. Raju, was booked under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Section 376, for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor girl.

The incident came to light on Friday, after the aggrieved parents of the eight-year-old girl approached the police and the District Collector for action.

It was learnt that the family from Kuda Kuda limits had approached a local doctor on Wednesday after the assault.

According to information, the girl’s father, a masonry worker, was away, and her mother was engaged in a chore in the neighbour’s house when the incident took place on Wednesday evening.

The petition to the police said the father, who had returned from work, discovered the scene from the window as the door was locked from inside. The man escaped after an alarm was raised.

Town police said the suspect was taken into custody within 24 hours and relevant cases were booked, and an investigation was opened.

181,2020/10/09,‘CMs of erstwhile AP ignorant of Bathukamma’,"Schemes of KCR government are people-centric, says Minister

Chief ministers in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh did not know the importance of Bathukamma festival and the then leaders from the Telangana region also did not care, Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy remarked on Friday.

Similarly, the welfare schemes that are central to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government were not visible prior during the terms of the previous governments up to 2014 — “that difference itself is good governance,” he said.

Speaking at an event to launch the distribution of Bathukamma sarees to eligible beneficiaries in the town, Mr. Reddy drew a comparison with the pre-Telangana times, and said the State has been continuing its march of progress with the re-election of the TRS in 2018.

185,2020/10/09,Farmers in Khammam district take to drones to spray pesticides,"Spraying in one acre field is done in less than 15 minutes against hours of toiling involved in manual method

Remote-controlled drones are gradually gaining traction with some tech-savvy farmers in several villages, mainly in mandals bordering Andhra Pradesh, putting them to good use in these times of COVID-19 pandemic-induced farm labour shortage.

A couple of farmers in Siripuram and Astnagurthy villages in Wyra mandal and a few villages in Chintakani mandal have already started using drones for spraying pesticides on crops.

A progressive farmer of Venkatagiri village in Thallada mandal set a relatively new trend in the district by using a drone to spray the natural neem oil as part of organic pest control methods.

The availability of locally built drones, exclusively designed for spraying of pesticides, in the market in big towns of the neighbouring State is prompting some tech-savvy farmers to buy them for their own use and for letting the devices to other interested farmers on hire basis.

Labour shortage

This trend is gradually catching up even as the problem of labour shortage continuous to persist and more farmers evincing keen interest in drones to harness its potential for pesticide spraying operations. However, most of them are unaware of the regulations governing the aerial spraying of pesticides.

Sources in the Agriculture Department said aerial spraying of pesticide needs approval from the Central government agencies concerned.

Sources added that there is no provision for use of drones for spraying pesticide in the Insecticides Act, 1968.

“We have started using a drone for pesticide spraying recently and found it very useful in terms of saving time, cost of chemical and above all overcoming the shortage of farm labour,"" said M Venkateshwara Rao, a progressive farmer of Siripuram (Kanakagiri) village in Wyra mandal.

The drone equipped with micro sprayers, without any cameras, is proving to be immensely useful in spraying pesticide on our paddy crops with precision, Mr Rao, who is an agricultural graduate, said. It is completing the spraying operation in one acre field in less than 15 minutes as against hours of toiling involved in manual spraying method, he noted, adding that they have hired a trained person for operation of the drone.

When contacted by The Hindu, Joint Director of Agriculture, Khammam, Vijaya Nirmala said the department has not yet received any specific guidelines pertaining to the use of drones for pesticide spraying.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tghe2x/article32808066.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09FARMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/farmers-in-khammam-district-take-to-drones-to-spray-pesticides/article32808067.ece

192,2020/10/09,Reporting of events a journalist has bona fide reason to believe to be true can never be an offence: J&K HC,"The court quashed the FIR registered against Times of India reporter Mohammad Saleem Pandit in 2018 for publishing news regarding stone pelting on tourists.

The J&K High Court has quashed a First Information Report (FIR) against a journalist in Srinagar and questioned whether “fearless and frank reporting” should attract Section 505 of the Ranbir Panel Code (RPC).

“The complaint does not disclose the particulars of any such person who has been induced to commit an offence against the State because [of] the publication of the news report in the question. The contents of the FIR, which is based upon the complaint filed by some association of travel agents, are absolutely vague and devoid of any particulars in this regard,” Justice Sanjay Dhar observed on Thursday .

The court quashed the FIR registered against Times of India reporter Mohammad Saleem Pandit in 2018 for publishing news regarding stone pelting on tourists at several spots across the Kashmir valley.

“Merely because a report allegedly threatens to disrupt the tourist season does not bring its publication within the four corners of the offence as defined under Section 505(1)(b) of the RPC or the IPC (Indian Penal Code),” Justice Dhar held.

He observed that the question that arises is whether a fearless and frank reporting of events or incidents in a newspaper would merely be for the reason that the persons engaged in a particular business feel that their business would get adversely impacted by such news reports, attract Section 505 of the RPC.

“The answer to this question has to be in the negative because reporting of events which a journalist has a bona fide reason to believe to be true can never be an offence. Taking a contrary view would be violative of the right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India,” the Judge observed.

He held that fair and frank reporting of events by electronic and print media cannot be curbed merely because it may have an adverse impact on business of some class of persons.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ucc4r9/article32815903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JampKHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/reporting-of-events-a-journalist-has-bona-fide-reason-to-believe-to-be-true-can-never-be-an-offence-jk-hc/article32815904.ece

When asked that 1,692 cases of burning of paddy straw were reported in the state between September 21 and October 7 this year, indicating an increase by nearly five times over previous year, Mr. Garg said, it is not a fair comparison to make, it is still early stage of the season.

Moreover, this time harvesting was also done at an early stage. Also, during the harvesting season last year, there were rains and there was no fire. So, therefore, exact situation will be known by last week of October. Only then we will be in a position to say whether stubble burning cases have gone up or come down this year, he said.

Mr. Garg also said more harvest has been done till October 7 as against corresponding period of last year and if one uses this comparison as a yardstick then farm fire incidents are less .

The official said as per data till October 7, 1692 incidents were reported by satellite imagery, but during field visits by PPCB officials no stubble burning was observed in 763 cases.

A satellite gives data, but sometimes there are other kinds of fire which is not stubble burning, he said.

Majority of the stubble burning cases that have been reported so far in the state were from Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Patiala and Gurdaspur districts.

Notably, 8,000 nodal officers have been appointed in paddy growing villages of Punjab this year to check stubble-burning.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had recently appealed to farmers not to burn crop residue, as it could aggravate COVID-19 conditions apart from leading to pollution.

Seeking the support and cooperation of farmers in preventing stubble burning amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the chief minister had said that experts have warned it could have serious implications for people already suffering from lung and other diseases.

To effectively curb stubble burning during the paddy harvesting season, the PPCB had recently ordered that combine harvester machines without functional Super Straw Management System (SMS) will be impounded.

SMS is a piece of machinery attached with the combine harvester machine, which cuts the standing paddy straw into small pieces and spreads it uniformly in the field. The farmers then are not required to burn paddy straw before sowing the next crop.

Vardhan also directed them to carry out a comprehensive awareness campaign at the district, block, and village level, so as to make the people aware about ill effects of stubble burning on the environment.

197,2020/10/09,Commercial vehicles start operating with 100% occupancy in Assam,"Transport association ends indefinite strike after negotiation with government.

Assam on Friday became the first State in the northeast to allow all types of passenger vehicles to operate with 100% occupancy, almost eight months after the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic-induced restrictions kicked in.

This followed a negotiation with the State government to end an indefinite strike the All Assam Motor Transport Association (AAMTA) had called from October 5.

“We had on Thursday met the Transport Minister and Departmental officials with our demand to either increase fares if made to carry 50% passengers because of the pandemic, or let us operate with 100% passengers. The government agreed that the lives of thousands of people associated with passenger services were at stake and operating vehicles at old rates with half the passengers was not viable,” AAMTA secretary Pradip Das said.

“We received a notification at 5.30 p.m. on Thursday, allowing us to carry passengers to the maximum capacity. Some night bus services resumed operation thereafter and all other categories of vehicles from today [Friday] morning,” he added.

The AAMTA also conveyed to the government that it was not the duty of vehicle operators to make passengers wear masks.

“We can provide hand sanitisers but it is up to the passenger to take precautions, and the police and Transport authorities can always penalise them for not following safety protocols,” Mr. Das said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/commercial-vehicles-start-operating-with-100-occupancy-in-assam/article32814081.ece
198,2020/10/09,"Fodder scam | Lalu Prasad gets bail in Chaibasa treasury case, to remain in jail","Case pertains to fraudulent withdrawal of ₹33.67 crore when he was Chief Minister of Bihar

Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad was on Friday granted bail by the Jharkhand High Court in in connection with a fodder scam case.

However, Mr. Prasad will remain in jail as he is convicted in some other cases related to the ₹950-crore fodder scam.

Hearing case RC 68 (A) / 1996, the High Court granted bail to him as he has served half of the jail term in the case of the fraudulent withdrawal of ₹33.67 crore from the Chaibasa treasury in Jharkhand in 1992-93 when he was the Chief Minister of undivided Bihar.

The court asked Mr. Prasad to submit two personal bonds of ₹50,000 each and deposit ₹2 lakh for securing bail.

Bail rejected last month

On September 11 last, the court rejected bail to him in the same case as he had not served half of the jail term by the date.

Mr. Prasad was awarded a five-year jail term in the case.

“We appealed to the court to grant Mr. Prasad bail today as he already has served half of the jail term in the case and the court granted him bail”, Mr. Prasad’s counsel Prabhat Kumar told mediapersons in Ranchi. “We’ll also appeal to the court in another case related to the Dumka treasury in November 2020 and seek bail for Mr Prasad”, he added.

The Dumka case pertains to the fraudulent withdrawal of ₹ 3.5 crore from the district treasury between 1991-1996.

In the Chaibasa case, on January 24, 2018, a special CBI court in Ranchi convicted Mr. Prasad and other accused.

However, in July 2019, the Jharkhand High Court granted bail to Mr. Prasad in a fodder scam case related to the fraudulent withdrawal of money from the Deoghar treasury of Jharkhand as he had served half of his three-and-a-half year prison term in the case. Mr. Prasad has been awarded varying sentences in various fodder scam cases.

The RJD chief has been undergoing treatment at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for multiple diseases. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he is housed at Kelly Bungalow on the hospital premises.

After being convicted in the fodder scam cases, Mr. Prasad has been at the Birsa Munda central jail of Jharkhand since December 2017.

199,2020/10/09,Woman attempts suicide at Police Commissioner’s office in Gurugram,"She had earlier attempted suicide on two occasions, say police

A 28-year-old woman on Thursday tried to commit suicide at the Police Commissioner’s office here over a matrimonial dispute.

She was booked under Section 190 (Threat of injury to induce person to refrain from applying for protection to public servant) and arrested.

Assistant Commissioner of Police, Headquarters, Usha Kundu, said the woman had earlier attempted suicide on two occasions and got rape cases registered against her husband and a doctor in different police stations in Gurugram.

The woman got a rape case registered against her husband at Sector 51 Women Police Station on October 3. Her complaint came two days after her husband approached New Colony Police Station saying that the woman had married him without being legally divorced from her previous husband. He also accused her of “mentally” and “physically” harassing her and alleged that she had been demanding ₹10 lakh from him. Both the matters are under investigation.

Meanwhile, the woman reached the Police Commissioner’s office and tried to commit suicide, but was overpowered, said Gurugram Police spokesperson Subhash Boken.

The woman had come in contact with her present husband online during lockdown while searching for the job of a patient care-taker and the two got married at a temple on September 2. “The woman shifted to Gurugram to stay with her husband after the marriage, but the two were seen fighting at public places in two different police station areas. On one occasion, the traffic police personnel found them squabbling on the road. However, they told the police that they were a couple and were let off,” said Mr. Boken.

In February, the woman had attempted suicide and got a rape case registered against a doctor at DLF Phase-III police station. “The doctor was arrested and later released on bail,” said Ms. Kundu. In August, she again attempted suicide and got a case registered against her husband at Kotla Mubarakpur Police Station in Delhi. However, the matter was settled after the man agreed to marry her.

Her divorce case with her previous husband is pending in Allahabad Hight Court since 2017, said Mr. Boken.

Ms. Kundu said that the woman would be counselled given the fact that she has tried to commit suicide on at least three occasions.

200,2020/10/09,2 Maharashtra cops injured in attack by murder convict,"The criminal Navnath Gangurde was hiding in a forest near Thane after jumping parole.

Two policemen, including a junior officer, were injured in an attack on Friday morning by a murder convict who was hiding in a forest after jumping parole here in Maharashtra, an official said.

The injured personnel were members of the Crime Branch Unit-I of the Thane police and had gone to nab the murder convict, Navnath Gangurde (34), who attacked them with a chopper (a sharp-edged weapon), senior inspector Nitin Thackeray said.

Gangurde was undergoing a life sentence and released on parole recently. However, he jumped parole and went missing, said Thackeray, who is attached to the Crime Branch.

Police got information that Gangurde was hiding in a jungle in the CP Talao area of Thane district, he said.

A police team reached the spot around 5 this morning and found the convict hiding on a machan (a raised platform on a tree), the senior inspector said.

As the team members approached Gangurde to nab him, he attacked them with the chopper, injuring sub-inspector Datta Sarak and constable Anand Billare, he said.

The convict tried to escape, but was overpowered and taken into custody, Thackeray said.

The injured policemen were admitted to a local hospital for treatment, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2-maharashtra-cops-injured-in-attack-by-murder-convict/article32810597.ece
201,2020/10/09,Fishing cat to be the ambassador of Chilika Lake,"This will be an important step towards the conservation of the vulnerable species

The fishing cat will be the ambassador of Chilika Lake, the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia and India’s oldest Ramsar Site, which is being dubbed as an important step towards conservation of the vulnerable species.

The Chilika Development Authority (CDA) designated the fishing cat as ambassador at a meeting held to conclude the ongoing wildlife week.

The fishing cat is the only wild cat species in India that is a wetland specialist, and it’s found all around Chilika. Fishing cats are mostly found in marshlands fringing the north and north-eastern sections of the lake, according to a recently concluded study conducted by the Fishing Cat Project (TFCP) and the Indian wing of Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance (FCCA) in collaboration with the CDA.

“Future plans of this collaborative venture between CDA and TFCP includes regularising protocols to estimate fishing cat populations in Chilika, and to create a fishing cat conservation network by involving local stakeholders, college students, researchers, non-government and government organisations,” said Susanta Nanda, the CDA’s Chief Executive Officer.

According to Mr. Nanda, the fishing cat is a Schedule I species and deserves conservation measures of the highest order in India, as with the tiger and elephant.

“Unfortunately, marshland and mangrove ecosystems, which are fishing cat habitat, are on decline. The CDA will be according highest priority in conserving the habitat and its population in future,” he said.

Chilika has one of the country’s largest extensive marsh-ecosystems, spanning around 100 sq. km.

“Projecting the fishing cat as the face of the marshlands will raise the profile of the fishing cat and marshland ecosystems globally and nationally, which are otherwise neglected ecosystems. Locally, it will nurture their value among multiple stakeholders in Chilika,” said Tiasa Adhya, co-founder of the Fishing Cat Project.

Chilika’s marshes receive the maximum freshwater flow from the tributaries of Mahanadi and seasonal rivulets. Analysis of long-term data collected by the CDA shows that this area also has high fish abundance. This is significant given that fish are the lifeline of Chilika, sustaining 2 lakh fishermen families and globally threatened piscivorous mammals like fishing cats, smooth-coated otters and Eurasian otters.

“Management interventions are required to prolong the life of this marshland so that it can continue to provide for the globally endangered fishing cat, the hundreds of precious birdlife that arrive every winter here, and to the indigenous fishing community,” says Partha Dey, co-founder of TFCP.

The CDA plans to manage the marshes with a socio-ecological approach involving local stakeholders and ecologists. Estimation of fishing cat population will be done through camera traps in the near future.

The CDA has also decided to have a rescue and rehabilitation centre for birds, Irrawaddy dolphins, fishing cat and otters with the help of the Wildlife Trust of India inside the Chilika lagoon. This centre will cater to a long-standing need for rescue and rehabilitation of migratory birds and other flagship species of the lagoon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/3cjmj0/article26192818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MPNALABANA4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fishing-cat-to-be-the-ambassador-of-chilika-lake/article32809444.ece
202,2020/10/09,"In a first, MHA empowers Jammu and Kashmir government to impose property tax","The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has empowered the J&K administration to impose property taxes through the municipal corporations, municipal councils and municipal committees in the Union Territory, evoking criticism from the regional parties.

In an order, Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla issued several amendments in the Jammu and Kashmir Municipal Act, 2000 and Jammu and Kashmir Municipal Corporation Act, 2000 carried through the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization (Adaptation of State Laws) Order, 2020.

The former State of J&K had provisions to impose property tax in the laws enacted by the then Legislature.

The MHA has substituted Sections 72 to 80 and now Section 72 states in the previous Acts of 2000: “Unless exempted under this Act or any other law for the time being in force, Property Tax shall be levied on all lands and buildings or vacant lands or both situated within the municipal area... The property tax shall be levied at such percentage not exceeding 15% of the taxable annual value of land and building or vacant land or both as the Government may, by notification, from time to time specify.”

According to the order, every owner or occupier, who is liable to pay property tax, shall every year submit to the Executive Officer or any officer authorized by him in this behalf a return in the prescribed form within the stipulated period and in the prescribed manner.""

It said the property tax assessed and levied shall be subject to revision once in three years by enhancing the tax by such percentage not exceeding 10% of the tax as may be prescribed, commencing from the financial year from which the property tax is determined.

Reacting to the decision, Peoples Democratic Party leader Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra tweeted, “These new provisions not only erode the followed convention but will have serious negative repercussions in the future. Wisely, it will create more chances of corruption now.

203,2020/10/09,14-year jail for 5 in Odisha for siphoning off farm scheme benefits,"Mayurbhanj court also slaps a penalty of ₹27 lakh each on them

A local court in Odisha’s Mayurbhanj district on Thursday sentenced five persons to 14 years of imprisonment and slapped a penalty of ₹27 lakh each for siphoning off agricultural scheme benefits meant for farmers.

The case pertained to the Jalanidhi scheme under which farmers were encouraged to create captive irrigation sources through establishment of shallow tube wells, medium tube wells, bore-wells, dug wells and river lift irrigation projects. Farmers were entitled to subsidy assistance under the scheme.

As per the procedure, the Agriculture Extension Officer (AEO) submits proposal for eligible farmers and accordingly, banks sanctions loans.

In 2012-13, one agricultural implement supplier Bangali Charan Jena, along with his son Susant Kumar Jena, and agent Satyanand Patra allegedly hatched a conspiracy by taking Girija Sankar Mishra, manager of the Bank of India branch at Jharpokharia, and Satarupa Mohanty, another bank officer, into confidence.

They came up with a fake list of 131 beneficiaries of the Jalanidhi scheme and loans of ₹1 lakh were sanctioned in their names. As per the scheme, the loan amount should have been transferred to farmers. Instead, the amount of ₹1.31 crore was paid to the supplier.

When farmers lodged a complaint with the succeeding bank manager that the loan amount was never transferred to their accounts, the AEO was questioned. The AEO said he had no knowledge about the list. Subsequently, a case was registered with the Economic Offences Wing under the Odisha police Crime Branch.

The EOW probed the case and concluded that five persons were involved in the corruption.

After convicting the five, Chief Judicial Magistrate of Mayurabhanj Bikash Chandra Dey sentenced them to 14 years of imprisonment and slapped a penalty of ₹27 lakh each. Additional Public Prosecutor (in-charge) Santosh Kumar Prusty said all the accused were convicted under Sections 167, 467, 468, 471, 472, 420, 406, 409, and 120B of the IPC.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/14-year-jail-for-5-in-odisha-for-siphoning-off-farm-scheme-benefits/article32808410.ece
204,2020/10/09,Imphal court puts off hearing on bail plea in gangrape case,"A local court in Imphal on Thursday postponed hearing of a bail petition in the case of gangrape and murder of a girl. Though there was no official statement, it is believed that protest by women activists at the gate of the court complex was behind the decision. The women, displaying placards, demanded justice to the girl victim and denial of bail to the accused. It was feared that, as had happened in the past, the women may storm into the court complex and beat up the accused.

The court was to hear the bail petition of three persons accused of gang-raping and murdering the 14-year-old girl. Three more accomplices are yet to be arrested.

The girl’s mother died long ago and her father cannot speak. It was alleged that one youth lured her out on September 2 on the promise of eloping with her. She was then gangraped and left for dead. Morning strollers who found the unconscious girl rushed her to hospital where she was declared dead.

205,2020/10/09,Foreigners can’t be kept in jails that serve as detention centres: Gauhati HC,"It deprives them of basic human rights and human dignity, says court

The Gauhati High Court has said people declared as foreigners cannot be kept in jails that serve as detention centres, depriving them of basic human rights and human dignity.

The court has also issued a notice to the Assam government to submit a report on the steps taken to set up detention centres outside jail premises and “hire any private premises” if “suitable government accommodations are not available for the purpose.”

Cluster of petitions

Hearing a cluster of petitions filed on behalf of people lodged in Assam’s six detention centres and their kin, the High Court referred to a Supreme Court case involving 37 “Pakistani prisoners” while issuing the order on October 7. These prisoners “not required under Indian laws” were kept in jail despite completing their sentence by 2009 because the Pakistan High Commission did not confirm their nationality.

The High Court ruled that jails being used as detention centres were in conflict with the model manual for such centres. It referred to the apex court’s observation that detainees should be kept in an “appropriate place with restricted movements” pending their deportation or repatriation and provided basic facilities of electricity, water, hygiene, etc.

“Further, the requirement is that such detention centres/ holding centres/ camps should be set up outside the jail premises. The State government is also to ensure ... appropriate security at these places,” the court’s order read.

Taking note of the absence of designated detention centres, the Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua said: “... If appropriate suitable accommodation is not available and the acquisition of land and construction is pending for the purpose of setting up the detention centres, the State government may hire suitable building for setting up the detention centres.”

The Army’s retired junior commissioned officer, Mohammed Sanaullah, who spent a few days in the Goalpara detention centre in 2019 after he was declared a foreigner, said the government “might as well keep people like us” at home and “under surveillance” to save money on hiring private property.

Six jails

People declared foreigners or “illegal migrants” in Assam are kept across detention centres within six jails where they share space with others serving time for various crimes. These jails are in in Dibrugarh, Goalpara, Kokrajhar, Jorhat, Silchar and Tezpur.

A designated detention centre to house 3,000 people is being built in Goalpara district.

One of the petitions is on behalf of several ailing women who have been declared foreign nationals, while another is on the behalf of a convicted foreign national who has completed his sentence period.

A third petition was filed on behalf of a woman and a man who have not been declared as non-citizens by any of Assam’s 100 Foreigners’ Tribunals or convicted under any law.

The cases are being represented by human rights activist and lawyer Santanu Borthakur and the relatives of the jailed Dipika Sarkar and Nurut Zaman Dewan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/g4e2ny/article30795724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12ASSAMjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/foreigners-cant-be-kept-in-jails-that-serve-as-detention-centres-gauhati-hc/article32808414.ece
206,2020/10/09,Cong. alleges double standards in Madhya Pradesh by-polls rules enforcement,"A Congress delegation on Thursday, in a virtual meeting with the Election Commission, complained that officials in Madhya Pradesh were following a different yardstick in enforcing the model code of conduct (MCC) and COVID-19 guidelines for political parties ahead of the by-polls to 28 Assembly seats in the State on November 3.

The delegation, in a memorandum submitted to the poll body, complained that though COVID-19 guidelines allow only 100 people in any political gathering, the State government followed them selectively, depending on the political parties involved.

While officials filed a case against former chief minister and Congress leader Kamal Nath, they ignored violations by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress alleged.

The party also complained against Madhya Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Brajendra Singh Yadav allegedly distributing cash and other items among voters, attaching relevant photographs.

The Congress alleged that the State government had reduced mandi tax from 1.7% to 0.5% after the MCC came into force in order to influence traders, and hosted a public lunch programme after the inauguration of a rural project.

207,2020/10/09,Rajasthan High Court asks State about Central food aid during COVID-19 pandemic,"PIL raises issue of FCI not providing sufficient quantity of foodgrains to destitute, underprivileged people

The Rajasthan High Court has asked if the State government had made any additional demand for release of food aid from the Centre during the COVID-19 pandemic, while enquiring about the present status of beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and the process for revision of their lists.

The court’s query came during the hearing on a public interest litigation petition raising the issue of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) not providing sufficient quantity of foodgrains to the destitute and underprivileged people during the pandemic. Two law students, who filed the PIL plea, said the number of beneficiaries had increased exponentially after the data collection in 2013.

Affidavit sought

A Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty directed the State government, through the Chief Secretary, to be impleaded as a respondent in the case in view of its role in the matter. Additional Advocate General Rajesh Maharshi was asked to file an affidavit indicating the status of NFSA beneficiaries and the manner in which the State was proceeding to revise their lists.

Petitioners Himakshi Alaria and Harsh Kumar pointed out that the migrant labourers, daily wage earners, people excluded from the purview of social security pensions and those not covered in the NFSA were important contributors to the change of demography in the State. None of them was getting any food assistance from the FCI, according to the writ petition.

While the food stocks being disbursed by the FCI in Rajasthan amounted to 2.23 metric tonnes for a total of 4.46 crore beneficiaries, calculated on the basis of the 2011 Census and data collection in 2013, the State government has collected the data depicting the number of NFSA beneficiaries to be 5 crore. “This clearly establishes a shortage for 54 lakh beneficiaries,” the petition stated.

The Bench had in June this year asked the National Disaster Management Authority and the FCI to extend the maximum benefit to the poor and needy people without waiting for further directions from the court. Ms. Alaria said an analysis of reports had suggested that about 10 persons had died of starvation in the State.

The matter will come up for hearing again in the court on November 2. The petitioners have sought directions to the government authorities to provide an extra 30,000 metric tonnes of foodgrains to the State and get an explanation from them about fluctuations in the data of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana and differences in the quantity of foodgrains shown and delivered.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ezq0w4/article32808400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HCKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthan-high-court-asks-state-about-central-food-aid-during-covid-19-pandemic/article32808401.ece

Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal accused Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday of deliberately delaying a legislation to negate the Centre’s agriculture sector laws.

“We were the first to make this demand more than ten days back. We had asked the Chief Minister to call a special session and bring in a legislation making the entire State a single market yard. The farm organisation were making this demand too, but the Chief Minister was delaying it on one pretext or the other,” said Mr. Badal

He said the Chief Minister should listen and understand the pain and anguish of the farmers and farm labourers. The State government should immediately scrap the provisions of the ‘anti farmer’ 2017 APMC Act, which was amended by the ruling Congress after assuming power.

AAP demands meeting

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), meanwhile, has written to the Chief Minister, asking for a meeting of all the stakeholders, including representatives of farmers’ organisations and agronomists, and all political parties to discuss the issue threadbare.

The party’s State president and MP, Bhagwant Mann, said the special Assembly session must be at least for seven days for a detailed discussion.

212,2020/10/09,Minister inaugurates govt. arts college for women in Coimbatore,"Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani on Friday inaugurated a government arts college for women, a first for the district, by launching the admission process at a Corporation school in Puliakulam in the city.

He said the State Government had fulfilled a long-pending demand by granting permission to establish an arts and science college for women in the district. The college that would offer Tamil, English, commerce, maths and computer science with a total intake of 250 to 300 students would go a long way in fulfilling the higher education needs of girls, rural students and those from the economically weaker section.

The college offered the courses at ₹ 2,000 a semester, as against the private colleges that charged in multiples, thereby making higher education affordable. This, Mr. Velumani said, was in keeping with the Government’s promise of making higher education accessible. And, to underscore his point he said the Government had opened arts and science colleges in Thondamuthur, Pollachi, Mettupalayam and Palladam.

The Government had also converted the Bharathiar University constituent college in Valparai to a government arts and science college. To improve infrastructure in Pollachi and Thondamuthur colleges, the Government had sanctioned ₹ 8 crore for construction of additional classroom. For the Mettupalayam college, a new building was recently built.

The steps the Government had taken to provide well-equipped laboratories, laptops to students and others had only drawn more students towards to government colleges as could be seen from the increasing number of applications, he added.

215,2020/10/09,Pinktober celebrations held to create awareness on breast cancer,"The ‘Pinktober’ celebrations to create awareness on breast cancer was held at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital here on Friday. N. Yuvaraj, Director, National Health Mission, K. Senthil Raj, Director, NHM in Tamil Nadu, and other senior officials took part in the event.

Dr. Yuvaraj said, “the information must reach everybody. Women basically neglect their health. Most of the breast cancer cases are reported at later stage and it is better if detection is done at earlier stage.” He added that it would be a great achievement of the campaign if every woman was made to visit a public healthcare facility and undergo screening. He said that it was a highly avoidable cancer.

Dr. Yuvaraj said Salem was doing well in containing COVID-19 and the Centre had provided various schemes like insurance for healthcare workers and legal protection.

Dr. Senthil Raj said 14% of cancer detected among women was breast cancer. He advised officials to take the awareness campaign to entire district and Salem should become breast-cancer free. On COVID-19 containment and treatment measures, Dr. Senthil Raj said the Hospital was doing RT-PCR tests on a par with Madras Medical College and importance must be given for non-COVID-19 treatment as well.

Collector S.A. Raman appreciated the efforts of Hospital authorities in COVID-19 treatment. R. Balajinathan, Dean of the Hospital, said a 450ft banner had been erected outside the Hospital with awareness messages on breast cancer as part of the campaign .

Dr. Venkateshan, Head, Department of Oncology, said early detection was important in treating and curing breast cancer. He added that since 2018, 858 breast cancer cases were reported at the Hospital and chemotherapy had been provided to 2,100 patients, radiotherapy to 250 patients and over 2 lakh tablets had been distributed.

Palayam Range will have a school for the first time -- a Government Tribal Residential School (GRTS) or a school run by the Forest Department at Vilankombai.

There are 38 families in Vilankombai and 18 in Kembanur, both located behind the Gunderipallam Reservoir coming under Kongarpalayam Panchayat in T.N. Palayam Panchayat Union.

A special training centre under the National Child Labour Project (NCLP), with 26 children from classes 1 to 8, is being run at Vilankombai for seven years. To study further, they have to trek 10 km through dense forest to reach Kongarpalayam. But, they drop out owing to the presence of a large number of wild animals on this non-motorable route.

School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan recently announced that a school would come up at Vilankombai. It would initially be primary school. The Forest Department had demarcated for the school project 50 cents of forest land at the entrance of the settlement for the school.

A resolution needs to be passed in the Gram Sabha meeting for starting the school, which is getting delayed, said a senior official with the School Education Department. He said a request had been placed before the district administration for passing a special resolution so that the works could begin.

An official with the District Adi Dravida and Tribal Welfare Department said 26 children from Vilankombai and 24 from Kembanur would be admitted to the school. Since children from Kembanur could not travel six km through the forest every day, accommodation would be provided to them.

220,2020/10/09,Motorists want underpass at K.K. Nagar in Erode widened,"With vehicle flow on Chennimalai Road is expected to increase after the completion of Erode Outer Ring Road project, motorists want the railway underpass at K.K. Nagar widened to make it easy for heavy vehicles to pass through.

After the Corporation limits were extended on Chennimalai Road, many residential localities have come up on the stretch, making it one of the busiest roads in the city. The narrow underpass at K.K. Nagar allows passage of just one bus at a time while lorries and other heavy vehicles cannot use the underpass. Since many residential areas, schools and colleges have come up on the road, movement of vehicles is very high during the day. Seepage from Lower Bhavani Project canal and rain cause water logging in the underpass, thus preventing the movement of vehicles.

“It is a busy stretch and two-wheelers, cars and other four-wheelers have to wait when a bus passes through the underpass,” said T. Muthukumaran of Rangampalayam. He said once the ring road project was completed, there would be an increase in the vehicles using the stretch.

Members of Erode South District Bharatiya Janata Party have been urging the district administration to construct another underpass for the heavy vehicles. “Devotees from other States visit Arulmigu Subramanya Swamy temple in Chennimalai regularly. But their buses cannot pass through the underpass,” they said.

During peak hours, vehicles have to wait on both sides to allow vehicles from one side to pass through. “It is a long-pending demand of the public to widen the underpass,” said T. Jayaseelan of Vellode. He wanted widening works completed during the lockdown period.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fk5hoe/article32816529.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER10UNDERPASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/motorists-want-underpass-at-kk-nagar-in-erode-widened/article32816530.ece

According to an official source, migrant workers are returning to the district from their home States and movement of workers is free now. There have been a couple of cases where the workers were not quarantined on their return and there was a spread of the disease. Further, both, at the Central and State-levels, the governments are giving importance to Coimbatore because of the presence of a large number of industries. There are officials who are regularly monitoring the situation here.

Coimbatore Collector held a meeting with officials concerned and industry association heads recently to improve awareness.

""Earlier, we used to visit industries to ensure the standard operating procedures are followed. There were a few violations. Now, we go as a team with the local revenue officials and if there are lapses, we will take action,"" said an official in the Department of Industrial Safety and Health.

The Collector has asked all the stakeholders to improve awareness among workers. Further, the industries need to quarantine workers who are returning from their home town. If the workers are tested immediately on their return, the results may be negative. Those who are affected may experience symptoms only after a few days. Hence, the workers should be quarantined for at least a week and those who show symptoms should be tested, the official said.

Officials from the District Industries Centre engage with at least 10 MSMEs every week. “The spread is almost negligible among MSMEs. The units are also taking the required precautions. Even the micro units, where the space available is less, have sanitisers, soaps, etc. for the workers,"" said General Manager of DIC A. Karthigaivasan.

Almost 40 % of the migrant workers have returned to the industries here. They return by flight or buses.

B. Chandran of Moolakadu village near Devarshola in Gudalur belongs to the Kattunayakan community, a tribal group that rely on minor forest produce from the surrounding forests to sustain their livelihoods. Mr. Chandran was a daily wager and found work in the surrounding farms to earn his living.

“During a recent visit to the village by the Special Branch police, we learned that Mr. Chandran had to have his leg amputated and the family has to rely on the Public Distribution System for essentials,” said B. Babu, Special sub-inspector from the Special Branch police (Devarshola).

“We informed district Superintendent of Police V.Sasi Mohan about the family and on his instructions, personnel from the Special Branch visited the family on Wednesday and handed over vegetables and essential supplies that will last them a few weeks,” said Mr. Babu.

Financial assistance was also handed over to Mr. Chandran. “We have also got in touch with Non-Governmental Organisations and social workers to ensure that the family is regularly checked on and assisted when necessary,” said Mr. Babu.

231,2020/10/09,"River Noyyal, its tributary polluted with heavy metals, says study","‘Level of lead significantly high in water samples lifted from both rivers’

River Noyyal, the lifeline of Coimbatore district, and its tributary, the Chinnar, are polluted with heavy metals, says a recent study.

Samples of water, sediment and specimens of a freshwater crab species collected from the river had high presence of heavy metals such as copper, cadmium, lead and zinc, the study says.

Though similar samples from the Chinnar river showed the presence of these heavy metals, the levels were, however, not as high as those found in the samples from the Noyyal.

Samples of water and sediments from Noyyal were collected at Marudurai village in Tiruppur district and from Chinnar at Sadivayal village in Coimbatore district. Crabs were lifted with the help of farmers from two other locations. The study titled “Assessment of Heavy Metals Pollution in Noyyal and Chinnar Rivers, Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India with Reference to Crabs (Gecarcinucidae)-A Baseline Study”, and authored by V. Gayathri, T. Muralisankar, R. Rajaram, M. Muniasamy and P. Santhanam, was recently published in the Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology.

According to the researchers, the study on the pollution in the Noyyal is essential because it is a tributary of River Cauvery, the main source of water for drinking, agricultural and farming in many districts of the State.

Noyyal, which originates from the Vellingiri Hills in Coimbatore district, flows through four districts - Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode and Karur. The study found that the total hardness, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, residual (free) chlorine, dissolved oxygen, and alkalinity were significantly higher in Noyyal water when compared with the samples from the Chinnar. Further, pH, total hardness, chloride, nitrates, and alkalinity levels in the Noyyal water exceeded the permissible limits of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS 2012) for drinking water.

Zinc, cadmium and lead levels were found to have exceeded in the water samples of both rivers compared to the permissible limits of BIS and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA 2002), said the study. The level of lead was significantly high in the water samples of both rivers.

Presence of lead found in Chinnar water beyond the permissible limits of BSI and USEPA suggests that the river water was polluted by the metal, might be due to the dumping of domestic waste and agricultural activities in the river basin. The analysis of sediment samples from both rivers found a significant increase in the level of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc in Noyyal sediments compared to sediments from its tributary. Zinc content was high in the sediments of both the rivers, the study showed. It was found that the level of bio-accumulation of the heavy metals and biochemical constituents were higher in specimens of Spiralothelphusa hydrodroma crab species collected from the Noyyal than Barytelphusa cunicularis crab species collected from Chinnar.

According to the researchers, the two freshwater crabs were chosen for analysis as crustaceans-like crabs and shrimps are highly sensitive to heavy metal pollution. They tend to accumulate more heavy metals than fishes because they live in the benthic zone where the metals are stored in sediments, the study said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/y2fiy6/article32807598.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB09-NOYYAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/river-noyyal-its-tributary-polluted-with-heavy-metals-says-study/article32807599.ece

Inspector of Kunnathur Police Station Masutha Begam said on Thursday that a V.P. Alagesan submitted a complaint on September 15 against his relatives pertaining to a dispute related to ownership of 19.5 acre. The family members moved court in 1996 in Perundurai Sub-Court in the erstwhile Coimbatore district and the case was transferred to Avinashi Civil Court after the formation of Tiruppur district, she said.

235,2020/10/09,‘No major increase in occupancy of TNSTC buses’,"Over a month after the resumption of bus services by the Coimbatore Division of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), there has not been any major increase in occupancy in the district amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

A senior TNSTC official said on Thursday that only around 500 town and mofussil buses were operated of the 1,012 buses in the district. While the district used to see between 6.5 lakh and 8.5 lakh passengers travelling a day, the number has come down to around two lakh passengers a day, he said.

“Despite operating 50% of the total fleet of buses, the earnings are not even 50% of the collections prior to the lockdown,” the official said. The TNSTC saw around ₹ 40 lakh of earnings a day for the 500 buses, while the earnings used to be around ₹ 1.5 crore a day when the total fleet of buses were operated in the district.

Private bus operators also resumed their operations. The reason for the low occupancy in TNSTC buses could be the hesitation among the public to use public transport as Coimbatore district witnessed fresh COVID-19 cases at a steady pace, the official opined. With the situation less likely to improve before the upcoming festival season, the number of special buses for Ayudha Puja and Deepavali might be reduced by the TNSTC Coimbatore Division, according to him.

The official noted that no relaxations had been made in the COVID-19 precautionary measures inside the TNSTC buses such as allowing passengers only if they wore masks, provision of hand sanitisers to passengers, wearing of masks and gloves by the drivers and conductors and regular disinfection of the buses.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/e5kwm/article32807571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB09TNSTCBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/no-major-increase-in-occupancy-of-tnstc-buses/article32807572.ece
236,2020/10/09,Collector urges industries to follow precautions,"Collector K. Rajamani has urged industries to quarantine migrant workers who are returning to work and to test those who show symptoms of COVID-19.

At a meeting held on Wednesday with representatives of industrial associations, the Collector said that nearly 47,000 workers, who returned home during May-June, had come back. When the workers returned, they should be quarantined for a week to 10 days. Only those, who did not have symptoms, should be permitted to enter the factories. Even if a unit wanted to test all the workers, it should be done after four or five days of the return and not immediately.

In a press release, the Collector pointed out that the industries had started working with 100 % workforce. All units should use thermal scanners to check temperature, use pulse oximeters, and maintain registers. If any worker had fever or cold, he or she should be tested immediately. The units should also have hand sanitisers at the entrance. Vehicle parking area should not be crowded and there should be separate entrance for workers and to move goods. The masks and gloves used at industries should be disposed off safely. The common bathrooms and drinking water facilities should be cleaned regularly.

While the number of cases reported in industries was low in the district, all precautions should be taken.

The Collector told The Hindu officials from the Revenue, Health, Labour, and Industrial Safety departments and local bodies would visit the factories regularly to ensure that all the protocols were followed. Officials from the Industrial Safety Department visited 600 units and a few had some violations. Both, the Central and State governments, were monitoring the situation in Coimbatore district because of the presence of large number of industries. The industries had so far followed the norms.

237,2020/10/09,Indian Premier League 2020 | Delhi Capitals ends Rajasthan Royals’ Sharjah love affair to go top,"Despite being restricted to 184, Shreyas’ men showcase their bowling strength to prevent Smith’s team from making it three in three on the six-friendly ground

On a night when the Delhi Capitals fielders caught just about everything that came their way, with considerable style on a few occasions, Rajasthan Royals failed to put an end to its miserable run. Not even a return to its happy hunting ground — the Sharjah Cricket Stadium — helped, as RR lost by 46 runs on Friday.

The target of 185 proved too much for RR, as it slid to its fourth defeat in a row; only Kings XI Punjab is placed below it, with the tournament nearing the halfway mark. DC meanwhile replaced Mumbai Indians at the top of the IPL table after posting its fifth win in six games.

The night had begun promisingly for RR, with Smith winning the toss and his bowlers not allowing the rival batsmen to settle down.

On a small ground, which has already witnessed the biggest chase in IPL history (by RR, in fact), things weren't looking good for Shreyas Iyer’s men. But Marcus Stoinis (39, 30b, 4x6) and Shimron Hetmyer (45, 24b, 1x4, 5x6) ensured their bowlers would have something to defend. Once again, Jofra Archer was the pick of RR’s bowlers, taking three for 24 off four overs.

When Shreyas brought R. Ashwin into the attack in the third over of RR’s innings, the prospects of an interesting battle within a battle emerged. The India off-spinner won that battle against Jos Buttler, this time in a more conventional manner than last season’s run-out at the bowler’s end.

The Englishman’s plan to hit the bowler over mid-wicket didn’t quite come off, Shikhar Dhawan taking a terrific diving catch at square-leg.

Diving catch

Then, another excellent piece of catching saw the back of Steve Smith. The RR captain’s flick off Anrich Nortje, DC’s lesser-celebrated South African seamer, was picked up by Hetmyer diving forward.

There was more to come before long from the West Indian though, as he waited patiently for Sanju Samson’s miscued hit, towards long-on off Stoinis, to land safely in his hands. The wait for the Kerala dasher to return to form continues, however.

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal (34, 36b, 1x4, 2x6) and Rahul Tewatia (38, 29b, 3x4, 2x6) down the order tried hard, but it was not enough against a top side in top form.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jaz02t/article32817063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RABADAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-rajasthan-royals-vs-delhi-capitals-in-sharjah/article32814780.ece
238,2020/10/09,"Indian Premier League 2020 | Leaders without title play pivotal role in direction that team travels, says Eoin Morgan","Asked about his batting role in KKR line-up, Morgan said that it’s “flexible”, depending on conditions and opposition.

England’s World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan believes that “leaders without title” play an equally important part as the designated one if a team intends to travel in the right direction in its pursuit of greatness.

Morgan is one of the key figures in the Kolkata Knight Riders set-up under Dinesh Karthik’s captaincy and he feels it has worked out well in the first three weeks of Indian Premier League.

So as a distinguished international captain, does he volunteer giving inputs to his skipper or wait for Karthik to approach him as a sounding board?

“I think it has worked really well so far. I think DK and Brendon McCullum lead extremely well within the team,” Morgan told PTI in an exclusive interview.

“Within aspect of the rest of the players, we have a number of senior leaders that take on roles that don’t have a title.

“And within the team, that plays a pivotal part because when other seniors players, apart from captain and coach and vice-captain, lead or take on directions or decisions, it gives absolute clarity for the rest of the team.”

KKR is currently placed fourth on the points table with six points for their three wins.

“Embodying that moving forward is so powerful that it creates intangible things that great teams talk about. Feeling the moment, the sacrifices that you make, it’s all worthwhile. So far we have made it work,” Morgan put forth his view point eloquently.

For an Irishman who has established himself as a respected captain while leading one of the most ethnically diverse cricket teams to global glory, Morgan enjoys that multi-cultural fabric which an IPL dressing room brings with players from different background, different languages, converging to create lasting memories.

“I feel sport is always transient but the language you speak when you are playing that sport tends to stay with you.

“It’s fascinating to watch guys talk about cricket in different languages in the change room and people who don’t know that language tend to understand and get the gist of what they are trying to achieve.”

Like many others, the 34-year-old Morgan also agreed that evolution of franchise cricket has brought players from different walks of life closer in a dressing room environment which promotes friendship.

“...Evolution of franchise cricket has made coming into a change room that has different culture with potentially a different language or two or three different languages a lot more easier to gel.”

He loves the fact that the English cricket fraternity, which looked at IPL as an “after-thought” seven-eight years ago, has come to accept that it now has players who are the most sought-after in this format.

“I think compared to previous seasons, certainly (I) not having played in IPL for a number of seasons, difference between an England player coming in now and an England player coming seven-eight years ago is even more.

“Because now some of our players who play in that England shirt are sought after players. Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer, these guys have genuine chances of becoming MVPs every year.

“That’s the level of confidence that now an English player brings as opposed to before, when it was almost an after-thought because of the conflict within somewhere and English players being deterred to come in many ways.

“It’s a completely different aspect, one that we love coming to town,” ‘Captain’ Morgan said, setting the record straight.

With 2240 runs in 94 T20 Internationals, Morgan has been one of the fine end-game players in shorter formats, a skill that he consciously developed to fit into flexible batting orders.

“I think, over the years, that is something that I have always aspired to do and throughout your career, probably through young age from mid 20s, particularly in international cricket where it is very difficult, standard is always high and there is always a counter to everything that you are trying to do.

“The more you play, the less bad or common mistakes you are going to make. Experience is worth its weight in gold and I have made most of my experience in probably the last two and half to three years,” he said.

Asked about his batting role in KKR line-up, Morgan said that it’s “flexible”, depending on conditions and opposition.

“I think middle-order is quite flexible at the moment, depending on what team we play and type of attack we come up against.

“Different batters are suited to different bowlers and DK and coach are very good at reading what’s the right way to move forward in that regard. We have lot of options which are flexible.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/g1mxdv/article32813175.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MORGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-leaders-without-title-play-pivotal-role-in-direction-that-team-travels-says-eoin-morgan/article32813176.ece
239,2020/10/09,Indian Premier League 2020 | Focus on batting struggles as Chennai takes on Bangalore,"It remains to be seen if the Super Kings opt to jettison Kedar Jadhav given the team’s propensity to give players a long rope.

Chennai Super Kings will take on Royal Challengers Bangalore in an intriguing mid-table Indian Premier League clash in Dubai on Saturday with both teams battling inconsistency.

CSK all-rounder Kedar Jadhav’s selection will be under the scanner after his failure in the defeat to Kolkata Knight Riders.

The Super Kings sank to a 10-run loss on Wednesday, choking inexplicably with Jadhav’s approach to batting attracting criticism from all quarters.

It remains to be seen if the Super Kings opt to jettison the 35-year-old given the team’s propensity to give players a long rope.

Full schedule of Indian Premier League 2020

Despite Shane Watson finding his range in a 10-wicket win over Kings XI Punjab and Faf du Plessis’s consistency at the top, the middle-order continues to remain a concern for CSK with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni himself not being at his best.

If they do decide to bench Jadhav after his prolonged struggle, they have the option of recalling Ruturaj Gaikwad or picking N Jagadeesan, who has been warming the bench since the 2018 season.

While worries remain on the batting front, the CSK bowling has got better and they did well to restrict KKR in the previous game with influential all-rounder Dwayne Bravo returning to his wicket-taking ways.

Karn Sharma, who came in for Piyush Chawla did well to pick up a couple of wickets while not going for too many runs and the skipper will expect him to do the same against a formidable RCB batting unit.

Yet, Dhoni would prefer the pacers — Deepak Chahar, Sam Curran and Shardul Thakur — to provide early breakthroughs and stem the run flow.

However, the CSK bowling will be up against a strong RCB batting line-up led by captain Virat Kohli, who returned to form with a fine knock against Rajasthan Royals.

Though the Kohli-led team faltered in the subsequent match against Delhi Capitals, they will look for an improved performance against CSK.

Kohli aside, young Devdutt Padikkal has looked in good touch, while AB de Villiers has been a key player for RCB over the years. If the big-hitting Aaron Finch can provide a rapid start at the top, it would serve RCB better.

It is the bowling which would worry Kohli. Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal has, as always, been the leading bowler while Washington Sundar has been frugal upfront.

However, the pacers have not lived up to their reputation, with the likes of Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj and Navdeep Saini leaking runs.

Experienced Sri Lankan Isuru Udana’s inclusion has given a semblance of control towards the end of the innings.

How CSK’s batting does against an up-and-down RCB bowling attack and how its batters fare against the Super Kings bowlers could decide the fate of the game.

240,2020/10/09,Indian Premier League 2020 | Punjab have task cut out against Kolkata,"Kings XI Punjab are placed at the bottom of the table, while Kolkata Knight Riders are fourth.

Kings XI Punjab will have to play out of their skins to get their stuttering campaign back on track when they face fancied Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

Smarting from a 69-run drubbing at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad, it will not be an easy task for a struggling KXIP side to stand up to the challenge thrown by an all-round KKR team, which is a fine blend of youth and experience.

Following five losses and a solitary win, Kings XI Punjab are currently placed at the bottom of the table with two points, whereas the Knight Riders are fourth with six points from three wins.

Notwithstanding a couple of reverses, KKR are gradually emerging as a strong contender for a third IPL title, with many of their players striking form as the tournament approaches the half-way stage.

Full schedule of Indian Premier League 2020

Shubman Gill has already created an impression as an opener and now KKR have found another option at the top in Rahul Tripathi, who will enter the game with some confidence after his swashbuckling innings of 81 against Chennai Super Kings two days ago.

After a string of poor scores that led to him being replaced by Tripathi at the top, Sunil Narine seems to be rediscovering his old touch with both bat and ball, and evidence of that was his outing against CSK.

The experienced Eoin Morgan is a huge presence in the middle-order which also has Nitish Rana, always on the lookout to impress the team management with his performances with the bat.

And then there is Andre Russell, who has not set the tournament ablaze in the manner in which he is expected to.

The biggest cause of concern for KKR is the form of their captain Dinesh Karthik, who is yet to contribute anything substantial with the bat.

And though he came in to bat at number seven in the last game with not many overs remaining, Karthik has also failed to perform while batting at the number three position at the start of the tournament.

However, his captaincy has been excellent in the game against CSK, especially the bowling changes the out-of-favour India player effected during CSK’s chase.

In pace bowling, they have the young duo of Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi, besides the seasoned world number one Pat Cummins.

While in spin, Narine has Varun Chakravarthy for company, and the player from Tamil Nadu will be high on confidence after bowling out Mahendra Singh Dhoni in their last match.

Kings XI Punjab will again rely on their trusted opening pair of captain KL Rahul and Mayank Agarwal.

If Chris Gayle recovers from his food poisoning, he will make his first appearance in the ongoing IPL and that will be a huge boost for KXIP.

The mis-firing Glenn Maxwell is likely to make way for Gayle.

Nicholas Pooran’s exploits with the bat is a positive for KXIP and he will again look to play his shots freely.

Death bowling is a major concern for KXIP and they would need to get it right against a strong KKR batting line-up.

241,2020/10/09,BCCI apex council to discuss home series against England,"England is scheduled to tour India next year between January and March for five Tests, three ODIs and three T20 Internationals.

India’s home series against England will be up for discussion alongside the scheduling of the upcoming tour of Australia and the domestic season when the BCCI’s apex council holds an online meeting on October 17.

Board president Sourav Ganguly had said that the BCCI will do all it can to ensure that the home series against England remains in the country and domestic tournaments kick off at some point despite the fluid COVID-19 situation.

India’s COVID-19 case load is nearing 70 lakh and the death toll has surged beyond 1 lakh.

England is scheduled to tour India next year between January and March for five Tests, three ODIs and three T20 Internationals.

In view of the rising COVID cases in India, the UAE, which is currently hosting the IPL, had emerged as an alternative for the home series against England.

However, in the event India is able to host the England team, Mumbai could be the best option to create a bubble with three international venues - Wankhede Stadium, Cricket Club of India and DY Patil Stadium.

The state-of-the-art infrastructure at the new Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad is also an alternative the Board would like to explore.

As far as the domestic circuit is concerned, the BCCI had initially planned to start it with the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy from November 19, but there remains doubts due to the situation arising out of the pandemic.

Quite a few factors would have to be taken into consideration before going ahead with plans to start what could be a curtailed domestic season.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/amx6s8/article32565039.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10SOURAV,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bcci-apex-council-to-discuss-home-series-against-england/article32810457.ece
242,2020/10/09,IPL 2020 | Mayank’s early run out was a disaster: K.L. Rahul,"Bottom-placed KXIP were all out for 132 in 16.5 overs to slump to a 69-run loss, their fifth defeat and fourth on the trot in the ongoing league.

Kings XI Punjab captain K.L. Rahul rued the early run-out of Mayank Agarwal, saying it was a disaster for his side in its pursuit of a stiff 202-run target against Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match here.

Bottom-placed KXIP were all out for 132 in 16.5 overs to slump to a 69-run loss, their fifth defeat and fourth on the trot in the ongoing league.

KXIP made a disastrous start to their run chase as they lost two wickets inside five overs on Thursday.

In-form Agarwal (9) was run out following a horrible mix-up with Rahul (11) in the second over itself, while Prabhsimran Singh looked promising till he was dismissed for 11.

“When we lose wickets in the powerplay, it’s going to be tough, especially when we’re playing only six batters. Getting Mayank run-out wasn’t the ideal start, it was a disaster,” a disappointed Rahul said at the post-match presentation.

“It was also one of those days when everything we hit in the air went to the fielders.”

KXIP made amends for their woeful death overs bowling this season by conceding just 41 runs in the last five overs while taking six wickets, with leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (3/29) triggering a batting collapse for SRH.

Rahul was full of praise for his bowlers, saying: “The last five games we struggled with our death bowling, but that was a positive today. The boys showed courage and pulled things back, you expect them to score 230-plus after that start.”

The KXIP skipper also lauded Nicholas Pooran (77 off 37 balls) for his lone effort with the bat and young Bishnoi’s bowling display.

“Pooran is just so good to watch and he’s batting really well. Did the same thing every time he got a chance last year as well. One more thing for us to stay positive about, we know that Nicky will come good.

“Bishnoi has shown a lot of heart, he’s not been afraid whether it’s the powerplay or at the back end. He’s enjoyed those occasions. All our players are professionals and they understand their problems, as a captain you just put an arm around the shoulder.

“Everybody in this squad is talented. Sometimes it doesn’t come off and you’ve got to be patient with them,” he said.

Winning captain David Warner, who made 52 off 40 balls and shared a 160-run opening stand with Jonny Bairstow (97), admitted that he was a little nervous when Pooran was going all guns blazing.

“Enjoyed it, but was a little nervous when Nicholas was hitting them out with four overs to get in. I played with him in Bangladesh and when he’s hitting it clean, you always think hard,” he said.

He praised Rashid Khan for his impressive bowling, returning figures of 3/12.

“Rashid obviously gets shown a lot of respect, he’s a world-class bowler and it’s nice to have him. Obviously it’s disappointing and sad for Bhuvi but having him (Rashid) out gives others opportunities and we did okay,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/1rvloe/article32810131.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDIPL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-mayanks-early-run-out-was-a-disaster-kl-rahul/article32810132.ece
243,2020/10/09,Coronavirus | No posters outside houses of isolated patients will help reduce COVID-19 stigma: Experts,"Official sources had said on Thursday that there will be no sticking of posters outside the houses of COVID-19 patients under home-isolation in the national capital.

The Delhi government’s decision to do away with the practice of pasting cautionary posters outside the homes of people infected with coronavirus (COVID-19) and isolated inside, will help reduce the stigma attached to the disease, experts said on Friday. However, they also said this has some “disadvantages too”.

Official sources had said on Thursday that there will be no sticking of posters outside the houses of COVID-19 patients under home-isolation in the national capital. They had said the move is aimed at “minimising the stigma” resulting from affixing of such posters at the front portion of the houses of such patients.

Active COVID-19 cases fall below 9 lakh for first time after a month: Health Ministry

Dr. Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals in New Delhi, termed it a very “positive move.”

“I think this will help in reducing the stigma people have attached to COVID-19. There is so much stigma that one patient today came to my clinic from all the way from Bihar for a check-up. He feared he had the infection, but his family never got him tested and he just isolated himself back in Bihar,” he said.

Mr. Chatterjee, however, cautioned that this opportunity given to people who are home isolated, “should not be misused”.

“The infected people should stay at home and not roam around and show greater responsibility towards the community, by observing all the norms,” he said.

Mr. Chatterjee also underlined the stigma faced by doctors and other healthcare workers who got infected by COVID-19, saying, this new move will come as a relief to them too. Ajit Jain, the nodal officer for COVID-19 management at the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said the decision has both its pros and cons.

“There is stigma attached to COVID-19. When a poster is pasted outside someone’s house, the neighbours start avoiding the family. Even after they recover, people keep away from them,” he said.

It’s because of this fear that people don’t get themselves tested for the infection, Mr. Jain said. The advantage is that people will come out for testing in large numbers because even if they test positive, there will be no poster outside their homes. They won’t have to face peering eyes of others, he said.

“The disadvantage is that without the poster, no one would know who among their neighbours is COVID-29 positive. When people see the poster declaring home quarantine nearby, they start taking precautions accordingly,” he added.

The national capital recorded 37 COVID-19 deaths on Thursday, taking the toll to 5,653 while 2,726 fresh cases took the tally to over three lakh, authorities said. The number of people in home isolation increased to 12,890 on Thursday compared to 12,691 the previous day. The number of containment zones in Delhi rose to 2,734 on Thursday from 2,702 on Wednesday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/y29atv/article32814348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09IN-RAPID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/no-posters-outside-houses-of-isolated-patients-will-help-reduce-covid-19-stigma-experts/article32814301.ece
244,2020/10/09,‘Reply on plea on closure of pending challans of vehicle’,"Delhi High Court seeks response from Centre and State government

The Delhi High Court on Thursday sought response of the Centre and city government on a petition challenging the rules which require closure of all pending challans involving a vehicle, for availing service, like fitness certificate, connected with it.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan also issued notice to the police and sought their stand on the plea by a taxi owner whose application for renewal of fitness certificate of his vehicle was not considered as there were several pending challans connected with the four-wheeler.

Dharmendra Kumar, in his plea, has sought quashing of the provisions under the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) issued in 2018, which mandate closure of all pending challans to be eligible to avail services like no-objection or fitness certificates.

He also contended that the SOP provisions “infer that no work will be done even if a challan is under contest, throwing the principle of presumption of innocence out of the window”.

“The respondents [Ministry, Delhi government and police], thus, are violating the constitutional rights of the petitioner by denying him the right to contest challans and instead, forcing him to compound them by paying the amounts demanded without demur,” the petition said.

It has also contended that challans alleged to be pending against the petitioner’s vehicle are offences for which the driver, and not the four-wheeler, are responsible.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/reply-on-plea-on-closure-of-pending-challans-of-vehicle/article32807934.ece
245,2020/10/09,COVID-19 cases cross 3 lakh mark in the Capital,"No more posters outside houses of people under home quarantine, say officials

With 2,726 new COVID-19 cases being reported in the Capital in the past 24 hours, the total cases crossed the 3 lakh mark on Thursday, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government.

According to the bulletin, 37 more deaths have been reported, taking the total number of deaths to 5,653. Of the total 3,00,833 cases, 2,72,948, people have recovered till now and there are 22,232 active cases.

Both active cases and people under home isolation, which have been decreasing for almost a week, increased slightly on Thursday.

The government has also decided to end the system of putting up posters outside houses of people under home quarantine with their names and other details and has directed district officials to remove all such posters, according to officials. “District officials have been directed not to put up posters anymore and also remove the ones which are currently there,” a Delhi government official said.

Out of the total 15,833 beds available for COVID-19 treatment in the city, 66.7% were vacant, as per government data.

But 58.38% of the ICU beds with ventilators have been occupied and 56.9% of the ICU beds without ventilators are full.

The positivity rate (percentage of people testing positive for every 100 tests done) was 5.1% -- which is lower than September. The overall positivity rate till now is 8.6%.

The number of containment zones in the city on Thursday was 2,734.

The official said, “Due to stigma connected with the disease and posters outside their houses, people are not coming forward to get tested for the virus, even when they have symptoms. They go to hospitals only when they become severe and it leads to complications. By not putting up posters, we are trying to encourage more people to get tested for the virus and bring them into the government’s monitoring system.”

246,2020/10/09,‘Rules framed to tackle fake news on social media’,"Unlawful content on such platforms can be removed, Central govt. tells HC

The Central government has informed the Delhi High Court that it was aware of the dangers of fake news on social media platforms, and accordingly necessary guidelines have been framed under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules.

Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules provides a set of elaborate practices to be followed by the intermediaries — social media platforms — to redress complaints of users.

The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, in an affidavit filed before the court, stated that any unlawful content on social media platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, can be removed either by an order of the court, or a government notification or by the company’s grievance officers.

The grievance officer under the IT (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules is bound to redress any complaint relating to unlawful content within one month.

‘No clear mechanism’

The Ministry’s submission came in response to a petition filed by former RSS ideologue K.N. Govindacharya seeking removal of fake news and hate speech being circulated on social media and online platforms.

Mr. Govindacharya, in his petition filed through advocate Virag Gupta, has alleged that social media platforms “have become a haven for hate speech” and in the absence of details of designated officers, there is “no clear mechanism to enforce justice”.

“Social media platform cannot become a tool for rioting, even as they claim freedom of speech and expression,” the petition contended. It has further alleged that such platforms “have been misusing the idea of free speech and have not been complying with Indian laws”.

“Despite many steps taken by the police, growing trend of hate speech on social media, has increased burden of courts. In absence of any action, hate speech continues to grow on social media,” the plea said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rules-framed-to-tackle-fake-news-on-social-media/article32807919.ece
247,2020/10/09,Baba ka Dhaba and the magic of social media,"Viral video brings back luck to elderly couple running food stall in Delhi

Kanta Prasad pulled down his mask every few minutes to reveal a nearly toothless smile, his eyes taking in with gratitude the crowds thronging his tiny food stall, Baba ka Dhaba, that was forlorn and empty till just a day ago, much as it had been through the last six months.

On Thursday though, everything changed for the 80-year-old and his family that was on the brink of penury. Social media spun its magic with a video of Prasad tearfully recounting the desperation of the months since the lockdown being shared widely across platforms — and customers made a beeline to eat his food as did camera crews, bloggers and journalists.

Baba ka Dhaba, a little blue box at Malviya Nagar in south Delhi, was the cynosure of many eyes across the country, including celebrities from showbiz who posted appeals asking people to go there and get themselves a meal.

A day after the heartbreaking video, #Babakadhaba was trending on Twitter and the food joint was flooded with more customers than it had seen in 30 years of being in business.

“Like everyday, my parents started cooking at 6 a.m. When they reached the shop at 8.30 a.m., they found people already lined up outside. For the first few hours, we sold only parathas and then prepared more items,” said Azad Hind, Prasad’s 37-year-old son.

By 12 noon, all items on the menu, comprising chapati, rice, mixed vegetable, and paneer, all ranging between ₹10- ₹50, were sold out — much to their surprise and stupefaction.

Before COVID-19 took its toll on businesses countrywide, Prasad would make enough to save ₹4,000- ₹5000 almost every month. His stall, which he has been running with his wife since the early 1990s, hit its nadir during the lockdown and in the weeks that followed. The elderly couple barely made enough to make ends meet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/b3214w/article32807916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09DHABA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/baba-ka-dhaba-and-the-magic-of-social-media/article32807917.ece
248,2020/10/09,"Submit relevant judgments in support of plea, HC tells Karat","She is seeking FIR against BJP leaders for their ‘hate speeches’

The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked CPI (M) leader Brinda Karat, who is seeking registration of FIR against Union Minister Anurag Thakur and MP Pravesh Verma for their alleged hate speeches in relation to anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh here, to submit relevant judgments in support of her plea.

Justice Yogesh Khanna has posted the case for further hearing on November 2.

Requisite sanction

Ms. Karat has challenged an August 26 order of a trial court here rejecting her plea for registration of FIR against the BJP leaders on the ground that the requisite sanction from the competent authority, the Central government, was not obtained.

Ms Karat’s counsel Siddarth Aggarwal claimed that a cognisable offence is made out against the BJP leaders and an FIR should be lodged against them for their alleged hate speeches.

Advocate Mr. Aggarwal submitted that his client’s complaint was kept pending before the trial court for nine months and later, the trial court rejected the plea without even going into the merits of the case.

Mr. Aggarwal argued that the magistrate has refused to exercise the jurisdiction, which the law vests on him.

The trial court in its order had stated that prior sanction of competent authority — Central government — is required as per Section 196 the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) at the stage of ordering of registration of FIR as both Mr. Thakur and Mr. Verma are MPs.

Ms. Karat’s plea contended that when the State and the police have pointedly excused the speeches of the accused and other persons, the only recourse available to her was judicial.

The judicial recourse has been barred by the trial court without considering that the very State that is supportive of the accused persons would function as the sanctioning authority, the plea argued.

Ms. Karat had sought registration of FIR against the leaders under Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the IPC. Ms. Karat had stated that Mr. Thakur raised provocative chants during a rally. The complaint stated that Mr. Verma gave false, provocative and communal statements against the Shaheen Bagh protesters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/submit-relevant-judgments-in-support-of-plea-hc-tells-karat/article32807913.ece

250,2020/10/09,"Infection spreading from offices to families, notes NCDC report","‘Contact tracing in Delhi limited since the beginning, needs to be rationalised’

Contact tracing of COVID-19 positive cases in Delhi has been “very limited since the beginning” and it needs to be “more rationalised”, said a report prepared by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and submitted to the Delhi government.

The report titled Revised Strategy for control of COVID-19 version 3.0, which is yet to be made public, also noted that with the resumption of economic activities, workplaces are becoming “hotspots” and infection is spreading from workplaces to families. “Identification of workplace clusters for saturation testing after risk assessment should be undertaken on priority by all districts,” the report said.

On patients being ‘brought dead’ to hospitals, the report said that to “some extent” this could be attributed to “gaps” in the system and “delay” in accessing healthcare.

Critical care

“Mortality analysis of three Central government hospitals revealed that patients brought dead comprise 15% in RML, 6.5% in SJH and 44.6% in Lady Hardinge. Although dramatic course of illness is inevitable, but to some extent it could be attributed to system gaps in proper triaging/selection of patients to put under home isolation and delay in accessing critical care,” said the report, seen by The Hindu.

It has also pointed out multiple shortcomings in the fight against the virus.

‘7-10 contacts only’

“Contact tracing activities in Delhi have been very limited since the beginning. The number of contacts traced per positive cases on an average remained only 7-10 per contact,” the report stated.

It also said that the fatality rate in Delhi (1.9%) is higher than the national average (1.5%), and mortality rate of under 15 and people between 16-44 years of age is a “concern”. The report was prepared in consultation with an expert group headed by V.K Paul, member of NITI Aayog. Last month, L-G Anil Baijal had asked for a revised plan to fight the virus.

The report said that scaling up of daily COVID-19 testing in the city has “not been specific”. “Increase in number of tests should be reflected in increased case finding. Merely increasing number of tests to reduce positivity rate would not be appropriate,” the report said, adding that majority of testing has been done in camps at railway stations and bus stands and hence the majority of people tested are “asymptomatic”.

The report said that positivity rate of Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) is 4.3%, while that of RT-PCR is 20.2%. This again underlines that RT-PCR is more accurate, but the Delhi government has been heavily dependent on RAT. The High Court has also asked the government to increase RT-PCR testing.

The report said that criteria for scaling up of testing should be based on positivity of each district and preferably ward level, and should not be “target driven”.

“Testing should not be target driven rather it should be guided by surveillance in containment zones, number of positive cases and their symptomatic contacts identified and number of symptomatic persons identified at screening sites,” the report read.

It also said that 2,324 healthcare workers have been infected by the virus and recommended that the healthcare workers should be monitored on a weekly basis though rapid antigen tests, RT PCR tests, pooled RT-PCR tests and sero-surveillance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1m1618/article32807898.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08DELPRIYACOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/infection-spreading-from-offices-to-families-notes-ncdc-report/article32807899.ece

252,2020/10/09,Three members of ‘Lifafa gang’ arrested for robbing people,"Accused lured victims by offering them ride at low fare

Three members of ‘Lifafa gang’ were arrested for allegedly robbing people after giving them lift at a very low fare, the police said on Thursday.

The accused have been identified as Bablu (36), a resident of New Ashok Nagar; Laxman (40), a resident of Paharganj and Sunil Kumar (32), a resident of Dallupura, they said.

They used fake number plates during the commission of crime on Ring Road and national highways in Delhi. The accused used to target commuters waiting for conveyance to reach their destinations. They assured them to drop at their destination at low fare, the police said.

During the journey, they used to take passengers in confidence and on the pretext of police checking, they managed to obtain their valuables in a lifafa [envelop] and later either exchange the envelop or if the passenger resisted, they would rob them of their belongings, a senior police officer said.

Thereafter, they used to drop them on the way.

On Wednesday, the police got a tip-off that a member of ‘Lifafa gang’ would visit Dhaula Kuan to commit robbery around 11 a.m..

“Around 11.40 a.m., the police spotted a car going towards Gurugram. After spotting policemen, the accused opened the front and rear gates of their car and tried to flee the spot, but were nabbed,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (South-West) Devender Arya said.

One car, two loaded countrymade pistols, one silver chain and three live cartridges were recovered from their possession, the police said, adding that 19 yellow envelopes and two fake number plates were also recovered from the car.

During interrogation, Bablu confessed to his involvement in several cases of robbery and cheating in various parts of Delhi. He also said that he used to keep a fake ID card with him to pose himself as a policeman to dupe passengers, the DCP said.

254,2020/10/09,Same-sex couple moves court over marriage,"A same-sex couple has moved the Delhi High Court seeking to declare that the Special Marriage Act ought to apply to all couples regardless of their gender identity and sexual orientation.

The petitioners, both women, said they have been a couple for eight years, live together and share the highs, the lows, the joys and sorrows of life.

They sought a direction to the Sub-Divional Magistrate, Kalkaji, here to register their marriage under the Special Marriage Act.

Justice Navin Chawla, before whom both the petitions came up for hearing on Thursday, directed the registry to list them before the Bench of the Chief Justice of the High Court which is already hearing a petition to recognise same sex marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) and Special Marriage Act (SMA).

The two women, in their petition, stated that the lack of a legal structure around their relationship became increasingly stark when they tried to bring each other on as nominees in insurance and financial plans, just as a married couples does.

“The petitioners’ relationship is not recognised when they need to apply for address verification of their passport or apply for a joint bank account or co-own assets,” their plea stated.

The couple said they are unable to do simple things that a married couple takes for granted. They said that for the longest time, one of them did not have any proof of residence, even though the other owns the flat they live in. This became particularly difficult when they had to apply for a passport to travel abroad.

Additionally, the couple cannot take medical decisions for each other if the other partner is unable to consent to a medical procedure or take end-of-life decisions, their plea contended.

“The petitioners wish to have the protection of the bundle of rights that a marriage provides, so that they are not trying to get authorities to acknowledge their relationship for every entitlement or right that married couples would get automatically,” their plea said.

They have sought for legal recognition of their status as a married couple, and to be able to secure the rights, privileges, and benefits for each other appurtenant to the legal recognition of marriage in India.

They claimed that their plea for registration of marriage was rejected by the Indian consulate at New York on the ground that they were of the same sex.

They argued that the right to marry a person of one’s choice has been expressly recognised as being a facet of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

The Foreign Marriage Act fails to recognise same-sex marriages, and hence it violates multiple facets of Article 21 of the Constitution.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/kbrnmi/article31396929.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TVMLGBT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/same-sex-couple-moves-court-over-marriage/article32807866.ece

A man who would pose as a crime branch official, offer to drop people in his car, rob money from them and even withdraw cash using their ATM cards by threatening them at a gunpoint has been arrested in Trilokpuri, Delhi police said on Thursday.

Mukesh, the accused, would at times carry wireless sets to appear convincing as a CBI or crime branch official before his targets. He would then befriend the target, usually at a bus stop, by pretending to travel in the same direction as the person’s destination.

An associate of Mukesh would then arrive in a car and offer them a lift. When the target would get into the vehicle, another man already seated in the vehicle would play messages on the wireless set to mislead the victim into believing that he is a CBI or crime branch official.

Then, at an isolated place, they would rob the person at gunpoint. They would also withdraw money from their victims’ bank accounts using their ATM cards, a police officer said. They would drop the victim at a “safe place” and escape in the vehicle, the officer said.

Police said the matter came to light after several such incidents were reported to them. On June 30, a man complained to police that he was robbed by the gang of ₹1,70,000 when he was going to Burari in North Delhi.

“On Wednesday, we got a tip about Mukesh, the leader of the gang. He was evading arrest in several cases of robbery, kidnapping, theft and cheating and was at his house in Trilokpuri. Our team laid a trap and arrested him,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Bhisham Singh said.

During interrogation, Mukesh disclosed that he and his two accomoplices, both residents of Trilokpuri, were robbing people by posing as police officials, Mr. Singh said.

Mukesh was wanted in eight cases of robbery, kidnapping and cheating in South and Trans Yamuna area in Delhi, according to police. Police are now trying to nab his associates.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/man-arrested-for-robbing-people-after-offering-them-lift/article32807781.ece
257,2020/10/09,"Air quality poor, likely to improve in coming days","‘War room’ launched to monitor pollution

The air quality of the city continued to be in the “poor” category on Thursday, after dropping into the category for the first time in over three months a day before, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

“AQI is forecast to be in the higher end of moderate to poor category for Friday. However, AQI is forecast to improve thereafter to the moderate category. A gradual increase in stubble burning fires is observed around Punjab, Haryana, and neighbouring border regions on Wednesday,” said SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), a government-run monitoring agency in a statement.

As per SAFAR, the fire count in the region was 399 on Wednesday. The boundary- layer wind direction and speed are favourable for transport of pollutants towards Delhi, but a shift in the wind direction is forecast and it is likely to extend the moderate air quality condition for a few more days.

Environment Minister Gopal Rai launched a ‘war room’ at the Delhi secretariat on Thursday to monitor efforts to contain pollution, fumes and dust levels in hotspots.

He said that the ‘war room’ will be equipped with “high-end technology” to monitor real-time pollution data, hotspot conditions, and NASA-ISRO images of stubble burning.

Real-time data

“The war room is fully equipped with technology to monitor real-time pollution data. Three large LCD screens are present across the room. Real-time pollution data, which includes air quality and data of PM 2.5 and PM 10, Sulfur Oxide, Nitrogen Oxide, Ozone and wind speed, will be displayed in one of the screens. Through another screen, we will monitor the situation of 13 hotspots. Through a third screen, we will monitor NASA and ISRO pictures on stubble burning at the neighbouring States,” said Mr. Rai, who added that a 10-member expert team will operate from the war room.

In a related development, AAP attacked the CPCB for allegedly not taking action against coal-based thermal power plants in Punjab and Haryana, despite Supreme Court orders.

AAP Chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said that the CPCB is not a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) but a Central Political Controlled Board. “AAP wants to know why the CPCB is silent over the rampant violation of pollution norms by the thermal power plants in Haryana, Punjab and U.P. Despite the Supreme Court order and Central government’s direction, the 13 coal-based thermal power plants have not yet adopted anti-pollution technology,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kkbwzs/article32807764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE-Air-Qualitycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/air-quality-poor-likely-to-improve-in-coming-days/article32807765.ece

The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Thursday conducted an online session, ‘Youth Sabha’, pertaining to the preparation of the Master Plan for Delhi (MPD)-2041.

Issues ranging from improved public transportation, cleanliness, affordable housing to need for proper sanitsation facilities for workers from the unorganised sectors were discussed at the meeting where approximately 100 people participated.

Participants also highlighted issues pertaining to the lack of facilities available for transgenders and urged authorities to include such aspects in the new master plan.

Several participants also emphasised on the need to improve walkability and introduce cycle tracks for better mobility and take off pressure from other modes of public transport.

The suggestions put forth were a part of the third ‘Youth Sabha on Work – Live – Travel’, held by the urban body as a part of a series of consultations undertaken by it.

Discussions around the need for co-working spaces also took place with participants suggesting how old structures and unused spaces could be given out by authorities to students and workers to hold meetings and so on.

A resident of Madanpur Khadar highlighted issues pertaining to safety, lack of toilets and irregular access to drinking water. The need for an improved last-mile connectivity was also put forth.

Issues faced by women waste pickers were also discussed where it was raised that several of them were unable to board buses and had to walk for long stretches.

Suggestions invited

DDA Vice-Chairman Anurag Jain said, “The real stakeholders of MPD-2041 are today’s youth and they are one of the most important stakeholders. These discussions will continue and I urge people to put forth their suggestions and engage with us actively.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dda-conducts-youth-sabha-on-mpd-2041/article32807763.ece
259,2020/10/09,"EPCA directs Delhi, other States to implement GRAP","Diesel generators to be banned to fight pollution from Oct. 15

A Supreme Court-appointed pollution monitoring body has directed Delhi and neighbouring States to implement air pollution control measures under “very poor” and “severe” category air quality of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) from October 15, including a ban on the use of diesel generators, except for emergency activities.

The Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) on Thursday wrote to Chief Secretaries of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan on the issue.

“The use of diesel generator sets will be banned (other than essential/emergency services) in Delhi and in vicinity towns — Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida in U.P. and Faridabad and Gurugram in Haryana. In 2019, the States of U.P. and Haryana had informed EPCA that they will put in the required measures by winter 2020 so that electricity from the grid can be supplied without disruptions in these areas, which would then obviate the need for diesel generators,” the letter said.

Additional steps

The letter said that a CPCB-led task force and the EPCA will continue to review the situation. If the weather pollution turns adverse, then “additional steps”, including a ban on construction activity and enhanced parking fees among others will have to be implemented, as mentioned under a different category of the GRAP.

“However, in this winter with all the combined efforts of the Union and State governments, we should try and avert the need to use these additional emergency measures for pollution control. We recognise that the economy is already under stress post-lockdown and therefore, our combined effort is to ensure that there is no further disruption,” it said.

EPCA Chairman Bhure Lal said in the letter that there is “enough evidence” that pollution will make COVID-19 “more dangerous” and therefore, there must be zero-tolerance for air pollution during this period, as it will come at “huge human health cost”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/epca-directs-delhi-other-states-to-implement-grap/article32807746.ece
260,2020/10/09,Riots victim pleads case for higher compensation,"Assembly panel takes up five cases of inadequate payouts due to faulty MLCs

A 22-year-old man who lost his right hand during the communal riots that broke out in February was presented before the Delhi Assembly Minorities Welfare Committee as his case was initially put under the “minor injuries” section while his is a case of permanent disability.

The compensation due to the victim identified as Akram Khan, resident of Chand Bagh, is ₹5 lakh, but he was only paid ₹20,000 while at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital where he was being treated in February. Mr. Akram claimed that a bomb was thrown in his direction on February 24 and the severe injuries he sustained led to his hand being amputated.

Committee chairman Amanatullah Khan said that Mr. Akram’s case was presented before the panel. “His first medico-legal certificate (MLC) stated that he had suffered minor injuries. Later, it was changed to major injuries but he has suffered a permanent disability due to which he is entitled to ₹5 lakh,” he said. Government representatives present during the Wednesday meeting said that the matter will be looked into, Mr. Khan said.

“Three-four operations took place at GTB Hospital but my treatment there was cut short because it was made a COVID-19 facility. Three months after the incident and treatment at GTB, I shifted to St. Stephen’s Hospital where another operation took place. One more operation is left but doctors are yet to finalise the date. Money is a concern because I have lost my job and now I am fully dependent on my family,” said Mr. Akram, who has his elder brother by his side for physical assistance to perform basic tasks.

Four other cases

During the meeting, four more similar cases were flagged where the MLCs wrongly stated that the victims had suffered minor injuries while the injuries were actually grave, resulting in inadequate compensation.

The committee also sought response on six contentious videos that had surfaced during the riots, including one of a woman, Ragini Tiwari, who allegedly made provocative statements during a Facebook Live session on February 23. The government representative is said to have assured that the action taken report will be submitted in the next committee meeting.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/l17u9f/article32807738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL09-RIOTS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/riots-victim-pleads-case-for-higher-compensation/article32807739.ece

Mr. Yadav said that the criminals fired 22 rounds of bullets and police shot 28 rounds. “Our team received an information that criminals of a gang wanted in many cases would be coming to Rohini from Haryana to eliminate rival criminal. Acting on a tip off, a trap was laid on Khera Gaon,” he said. He added that at around 3.30 a.m., the gang members were spotted in a car. They were signalled to stop but they tried to escape. They sped on the vehicles but the police team managed to block their way, he said.

Later, they whipped out firearms and started firing on the police party. They fired three bullet rounds. However, none of policemen were injured since they were wearing bullet-proof jackets. In retaliation, the police team fired back, Mr. Yadav said.

Victim's sister , brother and other relatives met Mr. Shabbir Ali at his residence on Friday.

263,2020/10/09,"No LRS, no TRS: TPCC chief","Promises free regularisation once the party is returned to power

TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy has asked people not to apply for Land Regularisation Scheme (LRS) and the Congress would do it free of cost once it is returned to power.

“It is the most inhuman scheme to fleece people and we are calling upon people not to apply for TRS,” he said while speaking to reporters on Zoom App. “Congress would go to people with the slogan No LRS and No TRS,” he said.

Retired District Registration Officer Vishnuvardhan Raju termed the LRS scheme a burden on the people for no fault of theirs. He said 80% of the plots in Telangana were under gram panchayat layouts and this scheme will burden all of them to the tune of lakhs of rupees.

Giving an example, he said people from just one village on the outskirts of the city would have to pay ₹80 crore under LRS and imagine the burden on all the villages included.

Anyone who owns 200 yards plot would have to pay ₹50,000 and the amount increases sharply as the plot size increases.

He said it was strange that 14% additional fee was imposed where land was not left vacant for civic purposes. “Will the government provide that land now,” he asked.

‘KTR misled’

Stating that there was no humane angle in the LRS but only an intention to fill up the coffers at the cost of people, MLC T. Jeevan Reddy said the very intention of the government was to make money at a time when people had lost employment and were under tremendous financial stress due to COVID.

He accused Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao of cheating people and not keeping his word on the statement made in the Assembly. He said KTR promised on the floor of the House that charges would be levied based on the value at the time of the plot registration. But the subsequent GO issued did not mention anything about it.

People who bought the plots years ago for small sums would have to pay the penalty based on the present rates, which was illegal and unethical, he argued.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/no-lrs-no-trs-tpcc-chief/article32816454.ece

Two days after 21-year-old Kapa Varshini was involved in a freak go-karting accident, and later succumbed to her injuries, Meerpet police on Friday arrested the proprietors of the Hasten Go-Karting in Balapur, and one of their employees.

The accused have been identified as Gurram Lohith Reddy (29), and Modini Kiran Kumar. Both are residents of B N Reddy Nagar in Vanasthalipuram. The duo are partners at Hasten Go-Karting. The third accused has been identified as Kongara Srikanth (23).

The victim was rushed to a private hospital where she died.

According to police the accused did not have requisite permissions to run the establishment. They allegedly also did not have security measures in place. Police further stated that that the establishment did not follow COVID-related guidelines as laid down by the Centre and the State.

265,2020/10/09,Intensive spell of rain creates mayhem in Hyderabad,"Waterlogged roads led to severe traffic jams in many places

An intensive spell of rain lasting for over an hour on Friday has rendered Hyderabad a virtual Venice, throwing life out of gear for several hours, and giving commuters the taste of a living hell.

Roads became streams, and rain water entered homes in several low lying areas and slums. Several localities in the city recorded what could be more than a day’s rainfall otherwise, within an hour between 6.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m.

As per the data received from the automatic weather stations across the city, Asif Nagar received the highest rainfall at 15 centimetres, followed by Shaikpet at 13 centimetres.

Khairatabad, Red Hills, Vijaynagar Colony, and Banjara Hills were next in line with over 10 centimetres of rain, while Shaikpet, Srinagar colony, Tolichowki, Mehdipatnam, Gudimalkapur, Abids, Secunderabad, Patigadda, and Ziaguda all recorded very heavy rain.

In fact, for several localities such as Asifnagar, Khairatabad, Banjara Hills, Shaikpet, Mehdipatnam and Tolichowki, Friday’s was the highest rainfall recorded during the whole season.

Other areas receiving heavy rain included Sardarmahal, Begum Bazaar, Padmarao Nagar, Golkonda, Malakpet, L.B.Nagar, Kawadiguda, Nampally, Musheerabad, Asmangadh, Monda Market, Attapur, Amberpet and others.

Streets were virtual streams in low lying areas, and rain water entered homes in slums such as Anjaiah Basthi in Adikmet, Bapuji Nagar in Musheerabad and Shankar Nagar in Amberpet, and Osman Gunj near Jambagh.

Heavy water stagnation on main roads was reported from areas such as Karwan, Kala Pathhar, Musarambagh, Malakpet, Dilsukhnagar, Banjara Hills, Mehdipatnam, Attapur, Mallepally, Basheerbagh, Koti, Khairatabad, Somajiguda, Punjagutta and Hayatnagar which hampered the traffic flow severely for a long time.

People travelling from outside got stuck in the city, unable to reach the railway stations or bus terminals due to the heavy traffic jams on all roads.

Drainage network failed at several locations, leading to sewage water overflow on roads. At locations such as Chintal Basthi, overflowing storm water drains posed threat to commuters with waist deep water, forcing them to return.

Up to 8 p.m., GHMC has received a total of 271 rain-related complaints, 168 of them about drainage overflow, and 68, about water logging. Eight were complaints about tree fall or fallen branches obstructing traffic.

Department of Meteorology has predicted thunderstorm accompanied with lightning very likely at isolated places over Telangana, with occasional heavy to very heavy rains for the next three days.

Officials have attributed the rain to the low pressure area in North Andaman sea and Middle Eastern Bay of Bengal, coupled with an upper air trough. The phenomenon could transform into a cyclonic depression in mid Bay of Bengal and travel towards North and North-Western direction to hit the Northern coast of Andhra Pradesh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/q3067j/article32816104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-RAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/intensive-spell-of-rain-creates-mayhem-in-hyderabad/article32816105.ece

268,2020/10/09,HC objects to lawyer’s similar PIL pleas,"Telangana High Court on Thursday took a serious note of an action of a lawyer, who had appeared as counsel in a PIL petition over illegal constructions in Nirmal town, and personally filed another PIL petition on the same matter.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, taking strong exception to the lawyer appearing as counsel in a PIL petition and filing another PIL plea on the same matter, said: Stop joking with the court. The bench headed by the CJ said it would not hesitate to impose exemplary costs of one lakh rupees in the matter.

It remarked that the PIL petition system and the process of court was being misused. When PIL petition 235/2020 came up for hearing on Thursday before the bench, it was noticed that there was another PIL petition with similar content.

Lawyer Divya appeared in the fresh PIL plea filed by another advocate Ch. Naresh Reddy. The petitioner sought a direction seeking to declare inaction of Nirmal district Collector and Municipal Commissioner over illegal constructions and works in Nirmal town as illegal and arbitrary. The petitioner stated that illegal structures were coming up on lands meant for public parks and play grounds in and around Nirmal town.

Interestingly, earlier the bench had heard another PIL plea with nearly similar content. In that petition, Mr. Naresh Reddy, a lawyer of the HC, appeared as counsel. Noting this, the bench asked Ms. Divya as to how a fresh PIL petition can be filed when already another PIL plea with same content was filed and being heard by it.

269,2020/10/09,Oorali beats the pandemic blues,"For five months, Thrissur band Oorali performed online every day, playing songs and reading stories and poems

When Thrissur-based band, Oorali restarts performing after a month’s break, in mid-October, it will begin with a chant apt for the uncertainty engendered by COVID-19.

“The song invokes our ancestors; the spirits who have guided us safely to this point in evolution,” says Saji K, founder, composer and lead guitarist. “We still hold the energy to move ahead,” he adds, stressing on the fact that these times need bonding, a reaching out to each other.

Saji, a corporate trainer-turned-musician together with actor, director and singer Martin John C created the Oorali experience: a mix of music, theatre, poetry, art and song. The band that defines its folk-reggae music as contemporary and conversational has brought together actors, writers and visual artists. It is known for the political themes in its songs.

“From the day the lockdown came into force in March, we went online daily on Instagram and Facebook, creating a community that depends on us spiritually,” says Saji.

The daily two-hour show at 9.30 pm began with 30 viewers and soon ballooned to more than a 1,000 viewers from across the world. “On the 89th day, we were being watched by 2,000 fans. We engage in social commentary, so it becomes a live conversation,” says Saji. In these restricted times, Saji’s wife Diana doubles up as the band’s PR manager and also lends her voice in some songs. “Performing daily for two hours was a self-imposed tall order,” she says, “but we wanted to keep our fans’ spirits up to tide over this crisis. It came with its set of challenges. We needed more material and took time to learn songs from films, drama and folk traditions of various languages. Apart from songs, we read out stories and poems.”

As the viewers were global, the band sang songs in different languages apart from those they were already singing in: Spanish, Tamil, English, Malayalam and Bengali.

Paid performances for other Facebook pages and Instagram communities opened up a new sustainable avenue. “We have done 20 shows for other social media sites and people are sponsoring us; a different crowd sourcing platform has emerged where the dignity of artistes is upheld,” says Saji. Interestingly, apart from playing at music and literature festivals, and weddings, they were recently requested to perform at a funeral.

The band was founded in 2010 when Saji began producing background score for Martin’s ‘bus theatre’ experiment. Martin had returned after spending 10 years in Latin America, working in theatre.

The two began to take their new musical language to people in a re-engineered bus, Oorali Express. The staging of their social, political and topical concerns was termed bus natakam or theatre bus. Gradually, they added other members: singer, percussionist and visual artist Sudheesh KU and vocalist and bassist Arjun EV. Shaji Surendranath from the School of Drama, Thrissur began writing lyrics for their songs.

“Oorali is a character from the Padeni folk art of South Kerala that talks about topical social issues. This is where the band gets its name from,” says Diana, explaining that their musical language has never been mainstream and “was always about a different soundscape”. The motivational chant in the upcoming performance, for instance, points out Saji, uses “a lot of ethnic sounds” — wooden sounds, pipes and sounds of the jungle, with drums and guitar as constant.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/h93ome/article32811890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpband3jpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/oorali-beats-the-pandemic-blues/article32811891.ece

273,2020/10/09,"Waste-to-energy projects reek of corruption, says Congress","‘Conditions of agreement changed to suit the interests of contracting firms’

The State government’s decision to entrust private stakeholders with the task of establishing and operating waste-to-energy (WTE) plants in eight districts and its move to name the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) as the nodal agency and change the terms and conditions of the contract reek of corruption, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) secretary and former Mayor Tony Chammany has said.

Going ahead with the decision will result in civic agencies having to spend more than double the funds being spent now, on garbage treatment. This is because the firm that is chosen will presently have to be given over ₹3,500 per tonne of waste it collects. This is more than double the rate prevailing now. It will result in the firm getting ₹4,500 crore from the Kochi cluster (Kochi Corporation and neighbouring municipalities) alone as tipping fee, he said.

Moreover, the terms and conditions of the agreement were changed to suit the interests of private firms. The Centre’s solid waste management rules say that garbage treatment is the responsibility of local bodies. The decision to have KSIDC, an agency entrusted with promoting industrial development, as the nodal agency is a violation of the condition. A New Delhi-based consultant without proven expertise in the field was appointed sans transparent tender process.

A 10-member advisory committee had earlier fixed the norm that the tender would be awarded to the firm which produced energy at the cheapest rate. This condition was later changed to “the firm which transported garbage at the lowest rate.” It will result in firms not adhering to their responsibility of treating garbage and generating electricity from it, Mr. Chammany said.

He alleged that a senior government official who had recently retired from service was masterminding the entire episode, which would result in private firms unduly benefiting from the agreement, at a huge cost to the local bodies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/waste-to-energy-projects-reek-of-corruption-says-congress/article32808282.ece
274,2020/10/09,Coronavirus | 391 new patients in Ernakulam,"10,094 samples sent for testing on Thursday

Ernakulam district heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday, as fresh COVID-19 cases, at 391, saw a dip from previous days.

But Thursday also saw 526 patients being admitted to hospitals and first-line treatment centres (FLTCs). Sample collection was augmented, with a total of 10,094 samples dispatched from the district on Thursday for testing.

Of the 391 new cases, all, except six people, contracted the infection locally. There were eight health workers among the newly infected. Thrikkakara recorded 51 new cases, while Vengola had 36 cases. Fort Kochi, which had over 100 cases on Wednesday, registered just six new cases on Thursday, while Mattancherry had less than five new cases.

Meanwhile, 707 patients recovered. With 1,943 more brought under disease surveillance, the total number of people under observation has risen to 29,057 — 27,246 at home, 145 at COVID Care Centres, and 1,666 at paid quarantine facilities.

275,2020/10/09,Container lorries may be regulated on NH Bypass,"They can instead use the two ro-ro vessels

The movement of container lorries through the congested Kundannur-Edappally NH Bypass may be regulated from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., foreseeing the additional influx of vehicles when the six-lane flyovers are opened at Vyttila and Kundannur in a month.

The ongoing reconstruction of the Palarivattom flyover and the impending barricading of more areas at the junction could create traffic hold-ups at the junction. Taking container lorries off the NH Bypass will considerably decongest junctions on the NH Bypass, especially Palarivattom and Edappally, said sources in the city traffic police.

The curbs on movement of container lorries can be introduced if the District Collector prohibits their movement through the stretch from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Apart from decongesting the NH Bypass, it will also lessen illegal and haphazard parking of lorries on Container Road, they added.

The Collector heads both the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) and the District Road Safety Authority.

Ro-ro ready for operation

The alternative method to transport containers the cost-effective and environment-friendly way is to resume their transit in lorries on the waterway route from Willingdon Island to Bolghatty Island. While lorries have to travel over 40 km through congested roads, the waterway is less than 3 km long.

In order to facilitate the plan, the Cochin Shipyard had recently built a pair of roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) vessels for the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI). The Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) is expected to operate the vessels. The turnaround time per trip for ro-ro vessels is one hour, while it is more than double through the road route.

A private firm withdrew a ro-ro vessel it had operated on the stretch in 2017, mainly because of differences of opinion with the Cochin Port Trust over caution deposit. Moreover, the vessel needed a draft of 2.5 metres, while the waterway fell short of that in many places, official sources said.

MoU awaiting clearance from govt.

A draft of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between IWAI and KSINC is awaiting clearance from the Ministry of Shipping. The tariff per lorry and other aspects too have to be finalised. KSINC will host a webinar in a week, to take container lorry operators and other stakeholders into confidence. It is estimated that around 800 container-laden lorries are using the route every day. The two ro-ro vessels can operate in a feasible manner if they carry at least 300 of these lorries, although they have much higher capacity. Each vessel can carry up to 15 lorries and need a draft of only 2 metres, they added.

KSINC has readied crew and other infrastructure for the vessels, it is learnt.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/container-lorries-may-be-regulated-on-nh-bypass/article32808278.ece
276,2020/10/09,Commuters struggle with poorly maintained roads in Kochi,"Corporation officials attribute the shoddy state of roads to ongoing strike by contractors

Motorists are being caught off guard by potholes dotting arterial and side roads in Kochi and suburban towns, since the agencies that own these roads have not completed patch work, although rains took a week’s break.

While the worst maintained roads are in West Kochi, the situation in the city is in no way better. Faced with public fury over the deplorable condition of the Kundannur-Maradu-Pettah Road on NH 85, the PWD (NH Wing) has begun repair work and resurfacing in the busy corridor. “Vulnerable portions are being surfaced using concrete paver blocks, while the rest of the road will be resurfaced with bituminous macadam bituminous concrete [BMBC],” said a senior PWD official.

Dust generation

The inordinate delay in resurfacing the stretch has resulted in shops, other establishments, and vehicles getting thickly coated with dust, since hundreds of container and tanker lorries jostle for space with smaller vehicles along the corridor every day, said Shamier Abdulla, social activist. The recently launched anti-corruption people’s movement, V4 Kochi, too had expressed shock at the dismal condition of city roads, despite a steep fall in the number of vehicles.

Over the past two years, motorists have been demanding that the PWD (NH Wing) repair the pothole-ridden service roads of the Kundannur flyover. The agency attended to a few gaping potholes within a day of outrage in social media about the shoddy state of the service roads and the NH stretch on the northern side of the flyover.

Damaged bridges

The PWD (Bridges Wing) is under fire for the deplorable condition of the Harbour Bridge that links Thopumpady with Willingdon Island. Gaping potholes dot the bridge’s central portion and either end. The iconic structure, built during the British era, had been renovated over five years ago, at substantial cost. The PWD has also not repaired the severely potholed road linking Mattancherry BOT bridge with the Cochin Port.

Similarly, the Bridges Wing is facing flak for concrete giving away at several places on Venduruthy bridge, posing danger to motorists. The most vulnerable are two-wheeler riders who are caught off guard by potholes atop the bridge which was commissioned a decade ago.

Sources in the PWD (Roads Wing) said Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) was engaged in upgrading many arterial roads it owned. “They [CSML] have assured that potholes on Park Avenue Road and Banerjee Road will be repaired within a week. We will shortly repair potholes on MG Road and Civil Line Road. The stretch from the international stadium up to Kacheripady is being resurfaced,” they added.

Meanwhile, patch work is over at Panampilly Nagar, while resurfacing will be done during dry weather. The Vennala-Arakkakadavu Road and Vennala-Alinchuvadu Road are being repaired. Many projects could have been completed but for labour shortage following COVID-19 curbs, they said.

Officials of the Kochi Corporation cited the ongoing strike by a section of contractors who are seeking clearing of long-pending dues, as a reason for the shoddy condition of many side roads.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pavsrm/article32808260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-KI-HARBOUR-BRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/commuters-struggle-with-poorly-maintained-roads-in-kochi/article32808261.ece
277,2020/10/09,Corporation under fire for ‘failure to protect assets’,"Lawyers failed to turn up in court, alleges Opposition

The civic administration of Kochi has come under fire for failure to protect its assets.

Pointing to the attachment of the new office complex of the Kochi Corporation and the nearly 1.50-acre holding in which the building is coming up, in a civil dispute, LDF councillors alleged that the civic body had lost several of its valuable assets owing to the lackadaisical attitude of the administrators.

A civil court in Ernakulam had issued the attachment order on an execution petition filed by the Palace Administration Board of the Kochi Palace from which the Kochi Corporation had acquired the holding in 1989.

The Kerala High Court had issued an order in 2011, directing the civic body to pay a compensation of ₹1.85 lakh per acre, as the original compensation fixed for the land was adjudged as inadequate. However, the corporation failed to pay the compensation and present its case in the court, according to the lawyer of the board.

The case has been posted for October 14.

It was the inept handling of the case and related affairs that culminated in the attachment order, said LDF leaders K.J. Antony and V.P. Chandran, in a joint statement.

The LDF councillors alleged that the lawyers of the corporation did not turn up in court while the case was being considered. The civic body also failed to send responsible officials to attend the mediation process. The failure of the corporation to effectively handle such cases has culminated in a huge liability, they said.

The corporation is liable to pay a huge amount as compensation for land acquisition for Brahmapuram, Sahodaran Ayyappan Road, Atlantis overbridge, and the Thammanam-Pullepady road. Besides the compensation component, the civic body also has to pay an interest of around 15% in most cases. The delay in clearing the payment is adding to the financial liability of the corporation, they said.

The LDF leaders said the civic body had failed to initiate steps to protect its 16-cent holding on MG Road despite the corporation council directing it to act, they added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/corporation-under-fire-for-failure-to-protect-assets/article32808229.ece
278,2020/10/09,Conversion of lands around Mangalavanam banned,"Centre issues notification declaring 1-km-wide Eco Sensitive Zone around sanctuary

The forest, horticulture and agricultural areas, parks and open spaces earmarked for recreational purposes falling in the 1-km-wide Eco Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of Mangalavanam cannot be used as or converted into areas for commercial, residential, or industrial activities, with the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change imposing these restrictions through a notification, which was published recently.

The Ministry notified an area varying from zero to 1 km around the boundary of the sanctuary as the ESZ, which would cover the holdings of Southern Railway, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, and the Greater Cochin Development Authority. The holdings of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Cochin Port Trust, the sub-station of the Kerala State Electricity Board, Pandit Karuppan memorial, and Asmara, LMCC Convent, and other private lands too come under the ESZ of the sanctuary, which is located within the city, according to the notification.

However, the conversion of agricultural and other lands has been permitted to meet the residential needs of the local residents. The conversion shall be allowed for widening and strengthening the existing roads and construction of new roads, construction and renovation of infrastructure and civic amenities, non-polluting small-scale and cottage industries including village industries, the notification said.

Convenience stores and local amenities supporting eco-tourism, including home-stays can also be set up in the area, it said.

The notification empowers the State government to prepare a Zonal Master Plan (ZMP) within two years. The ZMP should provide for the restoration of denuded areas, conservation of existing water bodies, management of catchment areas, watershed and groundwater management. Soil and moisture conservation, needs of the local community and such other aspects of the ecology and environment that need attention should feature in the ZMP, it was suggested.

The Ministry suggested that all existing places of worship, villages and urban settlements, forests, agricultural areas, fertile land, green areas such as parks, horticultural areas, orchards, and waterbodies with supporting maps and giving details of the existing and proposed land use features be demarcated in the plan. The ZMP should be prepared in consultation with local people and the State government, the notification said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/nrv1xw/article32808219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mangalavanam-15,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/conversion-of-lands-around-mangalavanam-banned/article32808220.ece
279,2020/10/09,"Track drains, pipelines dumping waste into Periyar, says SLMC","It has reported instances of discharge of pollutants into the river

The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management has reported several instances of illegal discharge of effluents and pollutants into the Periyar.

SLMC Chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai had visited a few of these sources to ascertain the extent of pollution, as he was not satisfied with the response of the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) on the violations.

A drainage with little idea about its origin was found at the rear side of a bonemeal unit at Edayar. It was filled with septic waste, sewage, and other effluents and was suspected to be leading to the upstream of the river. A pipe was seen near the irrigation canal connecting the river and Chakkarachal paddy field. Its mouth was found opening into the river. Reddish and orange coloured thick water was seen flowing into the river through the pipe, said the SLMC report which was filed before the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

“Here it is relevant to note that at the other end of the paddy field, no source of water was seen flowing through this pipe. The intelligent deduction that can be made here is that underground pipes are laid starting from some industrial units, which ultimately discharge industrial waste illegally to the river through this pipeline. However, correlation is required through further investigation,” it added.

The SLMC chief found a drainage near another bonemeal unit. Local residents informed him that septic and sewage effluents were often pumped into the drain, and they ultimately reached the river. An illegal drainage was also found for alleged dumping of waste from a steel recycling unit. The committee received complaints from local residents about a lorry that was found dumping untreated effluents into the river. A pump set and hose were seen near the waterbody. The vehicle was seized by the police from the premises of a fish and chicken meal manufacturing unit.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/track-drains-pipelines-dumping-waste-into-periyar-says-slmc/article32808204.ece

281,2020/10/09,PCB to go after Periyar polluters,"Board to inspect industrial units located on the banks of the river

The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) is planning to inspect and collect data from industrial units and other establishments on the banks of the Periyar found contributing to its pollution.

The initiative is part of follow-up measures being taken after the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the government and the board to come up with a plan to save the river from pollution. The tribunal had recommended fixing environmental compensation on erring units and establishments responsible for the pollution of the Periyar in an order issued on August 19.

A meeting of senior board officials held in Thiruvananthapuram decided to draw up a schedule for inspecting the industrial units. The board will also inspect establishments located on the banks of the river functioning in violation of the Environment Protection Act and the Water Act. The inspection is expected to reveal the lack of effluent and sewage treatment plants in most of these units, resulting in rampant pollution of the State’s longest river.

The Southern Bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta had pointed out that the board’s report on the Periyar submitted on August 17 was only general in nature without specific comments on the report prepared by the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management appointed by the tribunal.

“There is no reference to the report submitted by the SLMC, and what is the proposed action that they are going to take on the basis of the suggestions given by the SLMC to prevent pollution from being caused to the Periyar,” it asked.

The counsel for the board had assured the tribunal that it would come up with a detailed report on the action taken against each erring unit along the stretch of the Periyar. However, senior board officials expressed doubts on whether the inspection report could be submitted before the next hearing of the tribunal scheduled for November 5, as the process of data collection and industry visit was time-consuming.

The board had informed the tribunal that a few units on the river bank had violated the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 and the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/qqdw2n/article32808171.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-KI-PERIYAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pcb-to-go-after-periyar-polluters/article32808164.ece

284,2020/10/09,"Traders, farmers hit hard by erratic lockdowns","Illogically designating areas as containment zones adding to the woes, they say

Erratic Sunday lockdowns and illogically imposed containment zones in and around the city in the wake of the COVID-19 spread have irked not only traders but also farmers in Kozhikode district.

The closure of the Agricultural Urban Wholesale Market at Vengeri due to the rising COVID-19 cases has put the farmers of Kozhikode and Malappuram districts into hardship.

“Those who reached the markets on Mondays and Thursdays to auction vegetables are now unable to sell their produce. We are awaiting an order for reopening the markets now,” Narayanan Kalpakassery, chairman of Sangha Maithri, an apex body of farmers’ forums, and convener of the auction committee, said, adding that farmers had been facing a harrowing time due to the recurrent lockdowns from April. More than a dozen traders and headload workers at the Vengeri market had tested positive last week. A major factor leading to the present situation was allowing traders from the Palayam market to merchandise after it was closed due to COVID-19 spread, according to many.

The district administration has been drawing flak for unscientifically closing and reopening markets and the commercial streets in the city. “The objectives of the administration in shifting the goalposts are ambiguous. One day it closed down SM Street and its adjoining areas and allowed other commercial streets to function.

Similar is the case with the Palayam and Central markets. Daily wage earners have no means of livelihood,” Velayudhan, a worker, said.

Adding to the woes is the illogical method of converting the divisions in the corporation limits into containment zones. If a person tests positive in a division, the administration brackets the entire area as a containment zone.

“It seems, the administration has no idea about the geographical area of a division. The name of a division does not necessarily depend on the electoral or revenue areas. That means, a geographical area of a division will be spread across a major junction without any link to its revenue name,” Abdul Gafoor, a businessman, said.

The district administration has been urged to identify micro containment zones so as to avoid converting the entire division into a containment zone. “Hundreds of small businesses are on the verge of closure, not to mention the job losses in the unorganised sector,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/m1cjjs/article32808193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvkzauction,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/traders-farmers-hit-hard-by-erratic-lockdowns/article32808194.ece
285,2020/10/09,No Grey Area: Indian menswear with a twist,"Arnav Malhotra, founder of Chennai-based menswear label, No Grey Area, on why he is extending the reach of traditional garments like bandis and bandhgalas

Arnav Malhotra grew up around the fashion business. His parents, Tina and Atul Malhotra, were into exports, and for the last 20 years, have run the multi-designer boutique Evoluzione, with stores in Chennai, Bengaluru and Delhi. The business graduate from the University of Exeter, who recently launched No Grey Area (NGA), a menswear label, says, “I never wanted to be part of the fashion industry, and even if I was involved in the family business, I thought it would be around software or design, not clothing.”

However, over the past two years, he was increasingly involved in sourcing, working directly with designers. In May 2019, he curated The Sartorial Modernist, an edit for Evoluzione featuring 10 menswear designers who question and reinvent silhouettes, and renew and revive Indian crafts and fabrics. This included Akshat Bansal’s Bloni, Suket Dhir, Unit by Rajat Suriand Khanijo. He was also heavily involved in the relaunch of the Delhi and Chennai stores last year, introducing menswear labels as part of their new business strategy.

Meeting fashion in the Big Apple

The stage seemed set for him to be a major part of management, when instead, younger sister Ahaanaa stepped into that role, and NGA was launched. Arnav’s stint in New York in 2016 (working as a creative and business analyst) introduced him to style that is more individualistic than designer or brand-based. “That’s where I fell in love with fashion,” he says, adding, “NGA has been in the pipeline for a couple of years now, ever since I returned to Chennai in 2018.” The first collection of 2020 — or Episode 01 of Season 01 — is called Phantasm, and features everything from T-shirts to dhoti pants and bandhgalas to bomber jackets. Working out of Chennai, he heads a team of designers, giving them “creative direction”.

“Across the board, Indian menswear is under-represented. Internationally, people would immediately know what a sari is, but that’s not the case with a bandhgala or a bandi. With NGA, we are looking to add utility to clothing and modernising silhouettes in a way that makes Indian clothing accessible,” he says. The basic palette features white, black, navy and olive green as the base with maximalist prints of lions, flying fish and elephants. Look for the space camo pattern for a futuristic theme.

Arnav Malhotra in a No Grey Area T-shirt

While the casual T-shirts (with prints of dragons and phases of the moon, reminiscent of Rohit Bal) are made of cotton, the line also has reversible silk bandi bomber jackets featuring quirky designs on one side and a solid colour on the other. The resort shirts are made of bemberg fabric — a sustainable textile created from cotton seed linters. “We source fabric, zippers and buttons from all over the world,” he adds.

Rethinking luxury

Who is the target audience, with the line’s affordable starting price of ₹4,500? While he is aiming for the younger age bracket, he says this has been a sore point with potential customers. “You say it is great pricing, but in the aftermath of the pandemic, people are more concerned with the price tag. They want to know why a simple T-shirt costs ‘so much’. It comes down to quality and construction,” Arnav explains. In his previous experience of curating new brands for a young audience, he found that they would pick clothing that is comfortable, utilitarian and in tune with their personal style over a well-known brand. This gives him hope for NGA.

His own style is eclectic, featuring floral suits and streetwear. Some of his current favourite brands are NoughtOne and Space Biskit for athleisure. For formal wear, he picks the classic designers: Rohit Bal, Rohit Gandhi + Rahul Khanna, Rajesh Pratap Singh. I ask if we can expect another curation at Evoluzione soon, and Arnav laughs. “NGA is keeping me busy and is now my full-time work, so I do not know if that will be possible any time soon. You’ll have to ask Ahaanaa,” he concludes.

287,2020/10/09,Downpour leads to water stagnation,"Pedestrians and two-wheeler riders face hardship

Madurai

The heavy downpour on Friday evening resulted in water stagnation at major junctions and roads, leaving pedestrians and two-wheeler riders in a fix.

Water stagnation was reported in Goripalayam, Tallakulam, near Periyar Bus stand, KK Nagar and Munichalai.

The Secretary of Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association Ashraf Tayub said that water-logging was reported in core streets around Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, where road works were undertaken by Madurai Corporation.

“People had to wade through ankle deep water on East Aavani Moola Street following the rains,” he said.

Mr. Tayub added that a woman reportedly fell inside a large pit, which was dug up on Jadamuni Kovil Street, after rainwater filled the pit on Friday evening.

“Since the northeast monsoon will commence within a short period, it is important that officials place caution boards near the pits that have been dug up to ensure the safety of the residents,” he added.

The streets of Chockalingapuram were flooded following the rains on Friday evening, said S. Sridhar Nedunchezhian, a resident. “The rainwater entered the shops and it took nearly three hours for the water to recede,” he said.

Mr. Nedunchezhian said that the problem has been present for many years now. “The main issue is that a water channel in the area now lies lower than the level of Bypass Road. So whenever it rains, the water tends to enter the low-lying Chockalingapuram. Though we have complained regarding the issue several times, no action has been taken regarding this,” he added.

An official of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation said that rainwater was stagnant near Periyar Bus stand on Friday evening.

City Engineer S. Arasu said that the Corporation officials pumped out stagnant water from streets around Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple after the heavy downpour. “All pits that have been dug up for road projects in the core streets around the temple will be closed by October 15 and the work will resume only after the completion of Deepavali festival,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ukpjxz/article32816064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA10HEAVYDOWNPOUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/downpour-leads-to-water-stagnation/article32816204.ece
288,2020/10/09,T.N. in forefront in adopting emerging technologies: Minister,"Madurai

Tamil Nadu has been leading in the country in areas of e-governance, in attracting investments at global level and creating employment opportunities, said R.B. Udhayakumar, Minister for Revenue and Disaster Management, and Information Technology, here on Friday.

He was delivering the chief guest address during the inaugural function of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s virtual conference titled ‘Technology Enabled Growth and Opportunities-2020’. Madurai Collector T.G. Vinay and Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan were also present along with the Minister.

Mr. Udhayakumar said that the Commissionerate of e-Governance was created in 2006 to lead all e-governance initiatives of the State. The Centre of Excellence in Emerging Technologies (CEET) in TNeGA was created in January 2019 to bridge the knowledge gap between development and application of emerging technologies in government departments.

He said that Tamil Nadu is the first state in the country to sign a memorandum of understanding with a premier institution like the IIT Madras to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology in areas of health, education and agriculture.

“Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan is not only the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but also the vision of the Chief Minister. To achieve this, we need to pursue policies that are efficient, competitive, resilient and self sustaining,” said the Minister.

Later, the Minister delivered the keynote address during the Responsible AI for Social Empowerment (RAiSE) 2020 virtual summit, organised by the Union government.

The Tamil Nadu is among the few states in the country to have an integrated IT infrastructure. The State government is investing in emerging technologies like AI for implementing social, economic and welfare schemes of the State in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

TNeGA has developed an AI-based Face Recognition System for registering the attendance of students and office staff in a few government schools in Chennai. A ‘pest and disease identification system’ has been developed to help farmers using the Uzhavan application.

He added that the State government’s policy for safe and ethical AI has been formulated to provide a roadmap to the state’s adoption of AI policies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/m3jdun/article32816127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MINISTERRBUDHAYAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tn-in-forefront-in-adopting-emerging-technologies-minister/article32816128.ece

291,2020/10/09,Rise in admission to Corporation schools,"Good quality of education is provided, says Educational Officer

Madurai

A total of 6,307 students have been newly admitted to Madurai Corporation schools till date for this academic year. There has been an increase in the number of new students being admitted to Corporation schools when compared to last year, say officials.

There are a total of 15 higher secondary schools, nine high schools and 40 middle and elementary schools in the city within the purview of Madurai Corporation. The data provided by Madurai Corporation shows that 1,832 boys and 4,475 girls were admitted to Corporation schools this year.

Corporation Educational Officer P. Vijaya attributed the rise in the number of admissions in Corporation schools to the good quality of education provided at these schools. “It is important to note that the new number of admissions for Class 11 have increased in many Corporation schools,” she said.

One of the main reasons for the rise in the admission rate is that many students, who were earlier studying at private matriculation schools, had moved to Corporation schools in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Headmistress of N.S.S.B. Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School P. Meenakshi.

“The pandemic had financially affected many families and parents were unable to pay the high school fee charged by private schools. This year many students opted to study in English medium sections,” she says.

The quality of education provided at Corporation schools is on par with that of private schools, adds Ms.Meenakshi.

Apart from the academics, the Corporation schools have many programmes that focuses on the holistic development of students, said R. Murugeswari, Headmistress of Kasturibai Gandhi Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School.

The HCL Foundation, along with a few non-governmental organisations, is conducting programmes for students in several Corporation schools. Ms. Murugeswari says that the 'Happy Schooling' programme, which focuses on the mental well-being of students, has helped to reduce instances of bullying among students and have reduced their stress levels too.

“The student parliament that is functioning at schools help to improve the leadership skills of the students,” she adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/vuctay/article32814959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA10CORPNSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/rise-in-admission-to-corporation-schools/article32814960.ece
292,2020/10/09,Civic body collects ₹2.49 lakh fine from COVID-19 protocol violators,"Special teams were deployed to check business establishments as number of positive cases did not show a decline

The Corporation, which has deployed a special team each in all the four zones to conduct surprise checks in the business establishments across the city to look for COVID-19 protocol violations, has so far collected fine to the tune of ₹2.49 lakh in the past 25 days.

As the number of fresh COVID-19 cases getting admitted in the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital and other designated hospitals in the district, especially from the Corporation area, refuses to subside, the urban local body announced that those who fail to wear masks and maintain physical distancing when they come to public places would be fined, as per the recently enacted ordinance.

Though the operation against the violators started in August itself, four special teams were deployed to identify the violators after the ordinance was promulgated. This enabled the official machinery to slap on-the-spot fine on the violators.

“After the intensive operation started in September 12, we’ve so far collected ₹2,49,400 from individuals and shops who violate COVID-19 protocol such as not maintaining physical distancing and not wearing masks,” said G. Kannan, Corporation Commissioner.

Of this, ₹1.20 lakh was collected from business establishments that failed to enforce physical distancing among customers on their premises and ₹64,000 was collected for similar offence from individuals. Another ₹65,400 was collected from the business establishments that entertained their customers without masks.

Mr. Kannan said the special teams are conducting random checks at business establishments including meat stalls, eateries, restaurants, hotels, tea shops, grocery shops, supermarkets, fruits and vegetable shops, marriage halls, places of worship, bus terminuses, textile showrooms and other places.

“If business establishments are found to be violating the COVID-19 protocol repeatedly, the special team will seal the erring shops immediately. Hence, we appeal to the owners and employees of all business establishments within the Corporation limits to strictly follow the norms prescribed by the government to check the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the individuals should also strictly follow the norms,” Mr. Kannan said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/g9i4tp/article32814629.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA10FINETVL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/civic-body-collects-249-lakh-fine-from-covid-19-protocol-violators/article32814630.ece

300,2020/10/09,Khara lauds RBI’s discretionary tack,"SBI chief refers to ‘policy innovations’

The RBI’s decision to retain an accommodative stance even as it kept policy rates unchanged on Friday was broadly welcomed by lenders and economists.

“The policy statement by RBI is a perfect exposition of doing “whatever it takes” to revive growth,” said Dinesh Kumar Khara, Chairman of the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India. “With growth projections at -9.5% and inflation set to be higher at least for now, and the possibility of renewed infections in many countries, the monetary policy committee has rightly chosen to keep the policy stance accommodative and relying more on discretion based policy responses rather than being strictly rule-based.

“Accordingly, the decision to go down the Open Market Operations (OMO) route for State Development Loans borrowings, increasing the limit for risk weights for the retail portfolio up to ₹7.5 crore and linking housing loan risk weights to loan-to-value ratio are policy innovations that will...nudge the term structure of rates lower. The policy has also targeted specific sectors that have high forward and backward linkages notably the retail and real estate sector,” Mr. Khara added.

A. K. Das, MD & CEO, Bank of India said, “The measures are a potent force to support bond market, catalyse rate transmission and improve liquidity so as to be conducive to the revival prospects.” Retail and MSME segments would also benefit as a result of measures including the “enhancement of regulatory retail cap,” Mr. Das added.

The RBI’s policy was as aggressively accommodative as possible, opined Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank.

‘Simply not compatible’

“The decision to remain accommodative for an extended period and to look through “transient humps” in inflation reveals an appreciation for the basic principles of economics — that a GDP contraction of 9.5% is simply not compatible with demand side inflation pressures,” he said.

“If inflation has persisted over the RBI’s target limit, it has been driven by persistent supply side problems. Persistence itself cannot transform a supply-driven problem to a demand-side concern amenable to monetary policy driven containment. Given the stance, there is a significant probability of a rate cut in February, if not in December itself, as inflation, as we expect, moderates,” he said.

“The ₹1 lakh crore on-tap TLTRO window should enhance funding availability for companies as economic activity picks up in the second half,” said Krishnan Sitaraman, Senior Director, Crisil Ratings. “The last TLTRO scheme had enabled BBB and A rated entities to access funding through bonds, which was otherwise challenging for them.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nr3nav/article32816415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBUSBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/khara-lauds-rbis-discretionary-tack/article32816416.ece
301,2020/10/09,RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das tries tough love with bond market,"‘Market participants need to take a broader time perspective, bid with sensitivity to signals from RBI’

With large borrowings to be facilitated for the Centre and the States in the second half of 2020-21, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday sought market participants’ cooperation and termed ‘the orderly evolution’ of the yield curve a public good for which they shared responsibility with the central bank.

Mr. Das reiterated an assurance that the additional borrowings required to meet the exigencies of the pandemic, would be completed in a ‘non-disruptive manner without compromising on price and financial stability’. Conceding that the expanded debt supply had imposed pressures on the market, he said the RBI was ready to assuage such pressures and dispel any liquidity concerns in financial markets.

“Market participants, on their part, need to take a broader time perspective and display bidding behaviour that reflects a sensitivity to the signals from the RBI in the conduct of monetary policy and debt management. We look forward to cooperative solutions for the borrowing programme for the second half of the year,” Mr. Das said, in a direct message to bond markets.

“Over the last few weeks, there has been some disconnect between the rationale underlying the RBI’s debt management and monetary operations on the one hand, and expectations in the market, on the other,” he said, likely alluding to some recent auctions of government debt that failed to elicit enthusiasm from investors.

“It is said that it takes at least two views to make a market, but these views can be competitive without being combative,” Mr. Das remarked. The RBI, he said, had decided to double the size of its liquidity-enhancing open market operations (OMOs) to ₹20,000 crore based on market feedback, adding that he expected participants to ‘respond positively’ to the move.

Three immediate measures were announced to ease liquidity — allowing banks to hold more SLR holdings till maturity for securities purchased in the second half of 2020-21, targeted long-term repo operations for up to ₹1 lakh crore with tenors of up to three years, and open market operations in State Development Loans as a ‘special case’. Mr Das said these steps ought to allay market concerns about ‘illiquidity and absorptive capacity for the total government borrowing in the current year.’

Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA Ratings, said it remained to be seen if the RBI’s commitment to facilitate government borrowing, and its explicit signals aimed at softening yields, would prove adequate “to ensure that the bond market shrugs off concerns regarding the fiscal health of the Central and State governments, as well as the large supply of State bonds that is expected in Q4 of 2020-21.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/mygrwb/article32816385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBUDAS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/das-tries-tough-love-with-bond-market/article32816386.ece
302,2020/10/09,Retail inflation expected to stay close to targeted level by last quarter of FY21: RBI Governor,"The RBI has kept the retail inflation target of 4 % with a bias of plus/minus 2 %.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday said retail inflation is expected to remain close to the targeted level by the last quarter of the current fiscal year. However, it is likely to stay above the tolerance level at 6.8 % for the quarter that ended in September 2020.

Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the key policy repo rate unchanged at 4 %, Mr. Das said while announcing the outcome the central bank’s bi-monthly policy review meeting.

It also decided to continue with the accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary — at least during the current financial year and into the next year — to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.

The RBI has kept the retail inflation target of 4 % with a bias of plus/minus 2 %.

Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is projected at 6.8 % in Q2 of 2020-21. Subsequently, large favourable base effects are expected to pull it down to 5.4 % in Q3, and 4.5 % confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4 of 2020-21 are 3.2-5.9 % and 2.4-6.6 %, respectively, RBI said in the policy statement.

“For 2021-22, assuming a normalisation of supply chains with the availability of effective vaccines against COVID-19, a normal monsoon, and no major exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will move in a range of 4.1-4.4 %,” it added.

Mr. Das, in his statement, said that some of this optimism is being reflected in people’s expectations. In the September 2020 round of the RBI’s survey, households expect inflation to decline modestly over the next three months, indicative of hope that supply chains are mending.

“Our projections indicate that inflation would ease closer to the target by Q4 of 2020-21,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tmf0ys/article32623682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17BUSHAKTIKANTADAS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/retail-inflation-expected-to-stay-close-to-targeted-level-by-last-quarter-of-fy21-rbi-governor/article32812334.ece
303,2020/10/09,RBI to rationalise risk weightage on housing loans to push demand,"With revision in the risk weightage, the requirement of capital provision for banks will come down encouraging banks to push housing loan products with attractive features.

In order to promote the housing sector, the Reserve Bank of India on Friday decided to rationalise risk weightage on housing loans, making the product attractive for both borrower and lenders.

With revision in the risk weightage, the requirement of capital provision for banks will come down. This will encourage banks to push housing loan products with attractive features.

“Recognising the criticality of the real estate sector in the economic recovery, given its role in employment generation and the interlinkages with other industries, it has been decided, as a countercyclical measure, to rationalise the risk weights by linking them only with Loan to Value (LTV) ratios for all new housing loans sanctioned up to March 31, 2022,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said.

Such loans shall attract a risk weight of 35% where LTV is less than or equal to 80%, and a risk weight of 50% where LTV is more than 80% but less than or equal to 90%, he said.

This measure is expected to give a fillip to bank lending to the real estate sector, the statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies said.

According to a Bank of India senior official, the RBI’s move will give a major boost to the housing sector particularly the retail housing.

“Banks will definitely be benefited with lower provisioning by lending to this segment which will ultimately encourage banks to make this product more price attractive,” the official said.

Commenting on the decision, Housing.com Group CEO Dhruv Agarwala said rationalising risk weightage on home loans and linking it to LTV ratio will effectively result in higher credit flow to the real estate sector, which is positive news for the sector.

Also, the hike in credit limit for retail exposure by a single lending entity from ₹5 crore to ₹7.5 crore is a welcome move that will immensely help both retail as well as small businesses, he said.

As per the present RBI instructions, the exposures included in the regulatory retail portfolio of banks are assigned a risk weight of 75%.

For this purpose, the qualifying exposures need to meet certain specified criteria, including low value of individual exposures. In terms of the value of exposures, it has been prescribed that the maximum aggregated retail exposure to one counterparty should not exceed the absolute threshold limit of ₹5 crore, the statement said.

“In order to reduce the cost of credit for this segment consisting of individuals and small businesses (with turnover of up to ₹50 crore), and in harmonisation with the Basel guidelines, it has been decided to increase this threshold to ₹7.5 crore in respect of all fresh as well as incremental qualifying exposures,” it said.

This measure is expected to increase the much needed credit flow to the small business segment, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jp9s51/article31179785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/homeloan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-to-rationalise-risk-weightage-on-housing-loans-to-push-demand/article32812031.ece
304,2020/10/09,"RTGS to be available 24x7 from December, says RBI Governor","The NEFT system was made available on a 24x7x365 basis since December 2019.

In a business friendly move, the Reserve Bank of India on Friday said that Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), used for large value transactions, will be made available round-the-clock from December.

In December 2019, the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system was made available on a 24x7x365 basis.

Currently, RTGS is available for customers from 7.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. on all working days of a week, except second and fourth Saturdays of every month.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that to support the ongoing efforts aimed at global integration of Indian financial markets, facilitate India’s efforts to develop international financial centres and to provide wider payment flexibility to domestic corporate and institutions, it has been decided to make RTGS available round-the-clock on all days.

“With this, India will be one of the very few countries globally with a 24x7x365 large value real time payment system,” he said after the the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

The round-the-clock RTGS facility will be made effective from December 2020.

From July 2019, RBI stopped levying charges on transactions through NEFT and RTGS, with an aim to promote digital transactions in the country.

RTGS is meant for large-value instantaneous fund transfers while NEFT is used for fund transfers of up to ₹2 lakh.

The central bank has also decided to grant perpetual validity for Certificate of Authorisation (CoA) issued to Payment System Operators (PSOs) to reduce licensing uncertainties.

Currently, the RBI issues “on-tap” authorisation under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to non-banks issuing Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs), operating White Label ATMs (WLAs) or the Trade Receivables Discounting Systems (TReDS), or participating as Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units (BBPOUs).

Authorisation, including renewal of authorisation, of such PSOs has been largely for specified periods of up to five years.

While such limited period licences were necessitated in the initial period of evolution of the payment system, it can lead to business uncertainty for the PSOs and involves avoidable use of regulatory resources in the process of renewal, the Governor said.

“To reduce licensing uncertainties and enable PSOs to focus on their business and optimise utilisation of scarce regulatory resources, it has been decided to grant authorisation for all PSOs (both new applicants as well as existing PSOs) on a perpetual basis, subject to certain conditions,” Mr. Das said.

He also pointed out that RBI’s oversight framework has gradually developed into a more mature and comprehensive system, which clearly lays out its oversight expectations and the methodologies adopted for oversight of PSOs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/bsl9ak/article32183498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAKTIKANTADAS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rtgs-to-be-available-24x7-from-december-says-rbi-governor/article32811705.ece
305,2020/10/09,GDP likely to contract 9.5% in current fiscal: RBI,"Indian economy is entering into a decisive phase in the fight against coronavirus, says Shaktikanta Das

The Reserve Bank of India on Friday said the economy is likely to contract by 9.5 per cent in the current fiscal.

GDP contracted 23.9% in the first quarter of the fiscal, as per the estimates of the Central Statistics Office (CSO).

In a statement after the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said Indian economy is entering into a decisive phase in the fight against coronavirus.

Mr. Das also said contraction in economic growth witnessed in the April-June quarter of the fiscal is “behind us” and silver linings are visible, and highlighted the uptick in manufacturing sector, and energy consumption, among others.

According to him, inflation too is likely to ease to the target level in the fourth quarter of 2020-21.

The retail inflation (CPI), which the RBI factors in its monetary policy, has remained above 6 per cent in the recent months. The government has tasked RBI to keep the inflation at 4 per cent, wit a margin of 2% on either side.

The governor said GDP is likely to contract by 9.5% in the fiscal ending March 2021.

Mr. Das also said growth is likely to pick up in the second half of the fiscal and enter into the positive zone in the January-March quarter.

306,2020/10/09,RBI forecasts end to contraction by Q4,"The central bank announces a series of measures to enhance liquidity support to financial markets.

The Indian central bank on Friday reiterated its resolve to revive growth impulses in the economy and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic’s worst impacts, by extending its accommodative policy stance for the rest of this year as well as 2021-22, even as it held key policy rates unchanged in the face of high inflation.

Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said growth may “break out of contraction” mode by the January-March 2021 quarter as ‘silver linings’ are visible from September’s economic indicators as well as the COVID-19 case load curve. However, real GDP (gross domestic product) for the full year is expected to decline by 9.5%, “with risks tilted to the downside”.

While headline inflation has persisted above the tolerance band, Mr. Das said the central bank expects consumer prices to remain elevated in the September print, but ease gradually towards the 6% target over Q3 and Q4. This is the first time the RBI has shared its growth and inflation projections this year.

Terming the coming months as a “decisive phase” for the Indian economy in the fight against the pandemic, the Governor said: “By all indications, the deep contractions of Q1, 2020-21 (when GDP shrank 23.9%) are behind us… Barring the incidence of a second wave, India stands poised to shrug off the deathly grip of the virus and renew its tryst with its pre-COVID growth trajectory… The focus must now shift from containment to revival.”

The newly appointed Monetary Policy Committee members, Ashima Goyal, Jayanth R. Varma and Shashanka Bhide, unanimously voted in sync with the three RBI members to leave the policy repo rate unchanged at 4% and maintain a dovish stance for “as long as necessary — at least during the current financial year and into the next year”.

Although RBI expects private investment and exports to be subdued in view of anaemic demand conditions, Mr. Das said the farm sector could well lead growth revival through a rural demand spurt.

“Manufacturing firms expect capacity utilisation to recover in Q3... If, however, the current momentum of upturn gains ground, a faster and stronger rebound is eminently feasible,” the Governor said.

Wading into the debate about the possible alphabet shape for India’s recovery, Mr. Das dug into cricketing terminology to espouse his own expectation of a three-speed recovery. Apart from agriculture, sectors such as fast-moving consumer goods, automobiles, pharma and power would “open their accounts” first, he reckoned.

“The second category of sectors to ‘strike form’ would comprise sectors where activity is normalising gradually. The third category of sectors would include the ones which face the ‘slog overs’, but they can rescue the innings. These are sectors that are most severely affected by social distancing and are contact-intensive,” Mr Das said.

Apart from slashing a layer of red tape to expedite exports, the central bank also announced a rationalisation of risk weightages assigned by banks for all new home loans sanctioned up to March 31, 2022. This would give a fillip to the job-intensive real estate sector that has been flailing in the pandemic, the RBI said.

307,2020/10/09,Number of campus offers this year will mirror last year’s: TCS,"‘Clients want more automation based on early successes’

Customers are seeking more automation given the success of efforts over the past few years, even as the pandemic-led pause spurred them to cut wasteful expenditure, said N. Ganapathy Subramaniam, COO and ED, Tata Consultancy Services. In an interview, he said the pandemic had not impacted TCS’s campus hiring plans. Excerpts:

How have client priorities changed in these past months?

In wave one of the pandemic, client priorities were: their IT infrastructure and application landscape should never go down; to improve their employee experience so that there is no dilution of effort when working from anywhere remote and so that they are able to service their customers just as well; and, to improve their customers’ experience.

In wave two, they realised the automation they had earlier deployed — be it artificial intelligence or robotic process automation — has helped. Now, they want to extend automation to other areas. A key factor driving this is the need to lessen their staff’s work burden.

The fourth priority is cloud. Cloud has been proven beyond doubt that it is secure and scalable.This is important as organisations are embarking on a massive digital transformation on native cloud architecture, which will support not just one cloud; it could be hybrid cloud, with the ability to switch from one cloud to another seamlessly.

Life sciences/ healthcare is the only vertical that has grown both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. The telecom / media segment has seen the biggest hit... In geographies, Continental Europe has also shown growth, considering it is no more an insignificant contributor to your revenue... Could you throw some light on these counts?

Continental Europe has grown significantly for us in the last three years because of the investments we have made there, specifically in the way that we have structured our business, the opening of several offices, development centres, innovation labs; the investment towards market expansion has helped. Our own journey on agile was also fruitful there because European clients have adopted the agile way of working very quickly. The U.K. is struggling a bit due to Brexit and the uncertainty related to the pandemic, but in terms of business sentiment, people still believe that they should conserve cash. In life sciences and healthcare, we have done a terrific job in the last three years. Three years ago is when we started to focus there. Within healthcare, different segments have been affected differently by the pandemic. Scheduled surgeries have been postponed due to COVID-19; other surgeries that can be deferred are getting deferred. So, medical device manufacturers are seeing muted prospects. But in the pharma segment, clinical trials, investments in new discoveries… they are all seeing significant growth.

Broadcast media and entertainment have not been doing too well. Sporting events have taken a back seat. Telecom and information services are doing okay.

Are deal closures taking time?

For huge transformation deals, if the client wants to change existing systems completely to a new architecture, that is big-time investment; so in such instances, they would take their time. But we are looking at the pulse; if the customer is willing to take a long-term bet and invest quickly, and if investment dollars is not a constraint, then we structure it as a large deal.

There are others who really want to conserve cash, because they’re a bit uncertain about their market. In such situations, we break up the deal into incremental innovations and see how we can structure it as a series of smaller deals.

We are seeing enough new deal sign-ons. In the latest quarter, we had $8.5 billion worth of new deals. If take away the single $2 billion deal, it’s still $6.5 billion, which is a broad-based collection of a lot of smaller, midsized deals across segments. It is true that execution is preferred to advice, but if you can stitch together both and say you can get this piece done in six weeks, or let’s say, in six months, then that’s valued a lot more.

Do clients now feel they over the peak; are they looking at a return to normalcy?

No, I think people are not even talking about returning to normal. All they’re asking is how to continue to stay relevant to their customer base, to ensure their business can still take what is happening around them, whether they should tweak their products, pricing and access to channels, and how to make themselves visible so that there is no question of ‘out of sight, out of mind’ with their customers.

On automation, you had talked about cannibalising your own revenues about 3 years ago. Have results start kicking in or is it still work in progress?

It is still work in progress. Our machine-first philosophy and disrupting ourselves to do what is right for the customers has been our mantra. What has gone out from my pocket comes back many times over. But it’s a journey. Wherever we have done automation of some sort, be it deep learning, machine learning or artificial intelligence, our clients have found that in these challenging times, those areas have proved to be the most resilient. So, they have come back and asked for automation to be expanded to other areas . For example, if 90% of payment transactions are going through without exception they want the same thing on the security side, or the audit process, employee payroll processing. They want to see if employee interventions can be reduced to an absolute minimum and fully exception-based. Some of the stickiness that we are seeing is also due to that.

Are clients now weeding out waste in their businesses?

Almost everyone has taken this opportunity to step back and see what is actually working or not working for them. When they discover pieces of a business that are not adding value, they have the opportunity to shut it down or sell it off.

Does it mean prospects for a significant amount of offshoring, from which India would benefit?

The whole idea of onsite, offshore… that’s old thinking; nobody’s bothered about it any more. So many of our customers have operations running out of India. Does that make for offshore? If I call them strategic development outfits, then we are an extended part of their enterprise.

Second, it’s no longer about onsite-offshore, but about integrating talent across the globe in a seamless manner. Previously, we used to be very preconceived about it - I’m going to do this project out of my facility in Phoenix, ship some of the work to Budapest or Mexico, and some more work to Chennai. Now, because of our secured border-less workspaces, talent has become completely fungible. It doesn’t matter where they are working from.

Then comes the question whether this is going sustain for a longer period. In the technology industry, in the 80s and 90s, a technology arrived and stayed for at least 7-10 years. First the Y2K, then the Internet, then Java; 2005 onwards, innovation gathered pace. The technology obsolescence cycle began to contract. From 10 years, or seven years, it’s now about probably 3-4 years. Cloud and agility are making it even more rapid.

With tech obsolescence quickening, reskilling is not a one-off task...

Absolutely. Gone are the days of classroom training. It’s important that the learning doesn’t stop. It’s lifelong and is pretty much linked to your performance.

That’s where [as learning providers] you will have to gamify the learning process, because your digital learning platform as well as the content that you want to push onto that platform are both important. We have a huge team that curates the content that finds its way to the platform. In the last six months, the number of learning days or hours you put in per person has actually increased 30-40%.

Have TCS’ campus visits for recruitment been delayed this year?

This quarter is where normally we are in the planning cycle for demand for the next year. It’s reasonable to expect that we will make offers similar to last year — i.e., we made about 40,000 offers. Some of the universities have still not completed their exams. So, we are onboarding these students under condition that they will have to finish the exam whenever it is offered.

At your scale, what kind of acquisitions make sense?

It makes a lot of sense; the timing is right. We are open to banking, financial services, life sciences and healthcare; horizontally, things like variability of pricing engines is an area that interests us. We are looking at possibilities – should we partner with them, or should we really buy the model

Given your Q2 numbers, are there any levers you have for cost control?

We have done well in the [latest] quarter... if you exclude the provision that we made for the legal claim matter in the U.S… our EBIT margins have come to 26.2% which is more than a 250 plus basis points improvement quarter on quarter.

Is TCS still sticking to the vision articulated at the start of the lockdown, on having a chunk of your workforce work from home by 2025?

We call it the 25 by 25 vision. We believe there is no need for everybody to come to office and spend more than 25% of their time, maximum. The rest of the time, you should be able to operate remotely. It is clear that we need only 25% of the workforce in offices in order to make 100% productive. Today, we have only 3-4% in office, but all of us are productive. With our machine-first philosophy and automation, we should be able to achieve about 25% improvement in productivity and efficiency in the way we deliver our services. That’s a stated goal and vision and we are well on our way to be operating in that manner.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/bns2ag/article32816447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBUTCS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/number-of-campus-offers-this-year-will-mirror-last-years-tcs/article32816448.ece
308,2020/10/09,‘Home loans to get cheaper’,"‘Rationalisation of risk weights to free up funds for lenders’

The decision of the Reserve Bank of India to rationalise risk weightage on housing loans would play a significant role in boosting demand for the housing sector, said developers and lenders.

Such loans shall attract a risk weight of 35% where the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is less than or equal to 80%, and a risk weight of 50% where LTV is more than 80% but less than or equal to 90%, the RBI said in its policy statement.

Kamal Khetan, CMD, Sunteck Realty, said tweaks to risk weight norms would “help lenders on the capital adequacy front and enable them to provide more loans.”

“RBI... should also announce steps that are crucial for the sector’s survival and then introduce measures that will aid the sector’s revival,” Satish Magar, President, Credai National.

He said the extension of the moratorium and making all accounts that were SMA 1 or SMA 2 as on March 1, 2020 eligible for restructuring were among Credai’s demands to mitigate COVID-related stress on businesses and which the Centre should consider to help provide support to the distressed sector.

He said the move to extend the co-lending scheme to NBFCs and housing finance companies (HFCs) may infuse additional liquidity; however, strict due diligence norms and eligibility criteria will not benefit the realty sector.

Hardayal Prasad, MD & CEO, PNB Housing Finance, said, “The extension of the co-lending model will help expand leverage capacities of HFCs and unlock value for us.

310,2020/10/09,"Google Pixel 4a launched at introductory price of ₹29,999","It will be available in India from October 16

NEW DELHI

Google on Friday announced its Pixel 4a smartphone will be available in India from October 16 at a special launch price of ₹29,999. The company also announced a special launch price of ₹6,999 for its Nest Audio smart speaker.

Both devices will be available on Flipkart as part of the e-commerce platform’s ‘Big Billion Day’ Sale. While the Pixel 4a, whose MRP is ₹31,999, will continue to be available on Flipkart, Nest Audio (with an MRP of ₹7,999) will also be available soon at retail outlets such as Reliance Retail and Tata Cliq.

The U.S.-headquartered firm recently announced the global launch of Pixel 4a, along with two new 5G-enabled devices — Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5. However, the two 5G devices will not be introduced in India.

The Pixel 4a is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G mobile platform and has Google’s Titan M security module for on-device security. It comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and is powered by a 3140 mAh battery that the company claims will last all day.

Users of Pixel 4a, which comes in just one colour — ‘Just Black’ — and has a 5.8-inch OLED display, will get extra storage with three-month free trials of YouTube Premium and Google One.

For its new Nest Audio smart speaker, Google said it is 75% louder and has 50% stronger bass than the original Google Home. The smart speaker uses a 19mm tweeter for consistent high-frequency coverage and clear vocals, and a 75mm mid-woofer that really brings the bass.

“Google completed more than 500 hours of tuning to ensure balanced lows, mids and highs, so nothing is lacking or overbearing.

311,2020/10/09,Future’s asset sale to RIL breaches pact: Amazon,"U.S. firm sends legal notice to retailer

Future Retail shares fell 9% on Thursday after Amazon.com sent a legal notice to Future Group, alleging the retailer’s $3.38 billion asset sale to Reliance Industries breached an agreement with the e-commerce giant.

Amazon had last year bought a 49% stake in Future Coupons, which owns a 7.3% stake in Future Retail. In August, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance decided to buy the retail and some other businesses of Future Group.

Amazon’s investment came with contractual rights that include a right of first refusal and a non-compete-like pact, according to media reports. An Amazon spokesperson said it had launched legal proceedings.

“Amazon will try to explore all options to stop or delay the Reliance-Future deal but Reliance has all the muscle power and it won’t be an easy battle for Amazon to win at the court,” said Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at Forrester Research.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/l22jvu/article32806952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09BURELIANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/futures-asset-sale-to-ril-breaches-pact-amazon/article32806953.ece

The rupee strengthened by 8 paise to close at 73.16 (provisional) against the U.S. Dollar on Friday after the Reserve Bank of India decided to keep benchmark interest rate unchanged.

Reserve Bank of India on Friday kept repo rate unchanged at 4 % but maintained an accommodative stance, implying more rate cuts in the future if the need arises to support the economy hit by the COVID-19 crisis.

At the interbank forex market, the rupee opened at 73.21 against the American currency, then gained ground and finally settled at 73.16 against the U.S. Dollar, up 8 paise from its previous close of 73.24.

During the session, the local unit witnessed an intra-day high of 73.02 and a low of 73.26 against the greenback.

In light of the RBI monetary policy and also the usual Friday Gsec auction, trading hours were extended for both forex as well as bond markets.

“The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept policy rates unchanged and kept the stance as accommodative as was expected. The communication, however, was extremely dovish. The MPC overlooked current elevated inflation prints, viewing them as transient,” said Abhishek Goenka, Founder and CEO, IFA Global.

Mr. Goenka further said “the rupee had appreciated and forwards had got received but nationalised banks stepped in at lower levels to support USD-INR“.

This is the third consecutive session of gain for the rupee.

Meanwhile, the Dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.28 % to 93.34.

Equity benchmark index Sensex rallied 327 points on Friday, extending gains for the seventh straight session on the back of financial stocks after the RBI left benchmark rate unchanged but decided to maintain an accommodative stance.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das’ comments on expectation of GDP turning positive in the January-March quarter of the current financial year also fuelled the market rally, traders said.

The 30-share BSE index ended 326.82 points or 0.81 % higher at 40,509.49 while the broader NSE Nifty rose by 79.60 points or 0.67 % to 11,914.20.

ICICI Bank was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rising around 3 %, followed by Axis Bank, HDFC twins, SBI, L&T, ONGC and Infosys.

On the other hand, Sun Pharma, Asian Paints, Nestle India, UltraTech Cement and HUL declined.

Rate-sensitive banking and financial stocks ended on a positive note, with BSE bankex and finance rising up to 2.64 %, while realty and auto indices closed in the red.

While announcing the MPC decisions, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the benchmark repurchase (repo) rate has been left unchanged at 4 %.

Consequently, the reverse repo rate will also continue to earn 3.35 % for banks for their deposits kept with RBI.

Mr. Das said the Indian economy is entering into a decisive phase in the fight against coronavirus.

He also stated that the contraction in economic growth witnessed in the April-June quarter of the fiscal is “behind us”, adding that the GDP was likely to turn positive at 0.5 % in the January-March quarter of the current financial year.

The policy review outcome was as per expectations, but it was the good commentary on GDP outlook and the liquidity measures announced that cheered the D-Street, said Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO of Samco Group.

The central bank has given forecast of 9.5 % contraction in GDP this fiscal but the silver lining lies in the expectations of GDP growth possibly turning positive by January-March quarter (Q4),” said Gaurav Dua, SVP, Head - Capital Market Strategy & Investments, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Overall, the monetary policy is reassuring for the equity investors, he said, adding that it could provide the much required support to the banking stocks that have been lagging in the recent equity market rally.

Meanwhile, bourses in Shanghai ended on a positive note while Hong Kong and Tokyo ended in the red.

Stock exchanges in Europe were largely trading higher in early deals.

On Thursday, the rupee closed at 73.24 against the U.S. dollar.

Maintaining status quo for the second time in a row, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday decided to keep benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4% but retained an accommodative stance, implying more rate cuts in the future if the need arises to support the economy hit by the COVID-19 crisis.

On the prices front, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said inflation is likely to ease to projected target by the fourth quarter of this fiscal.

On the growth front, Mr. Das said gross domestic product (GDP) growth may break out of contraction and enter the positive zone by the fourth quarter of the current fiscal.

316,2020/10/09,Funerals under the barrel of a gun,"Drawing parallels between the events in U.P. last December and last week

“There were loud and persistent knocks on the door. They asked us to hurry while we were bathing my son for his funeral and preparing for namaaz. It was not dawn yet, but the police said we had no time,” said Nafeesa Parveen. Her son, 28-year-old Mohammed Mohsin, had succumbed to bullet injuries the day before in a brutal police crackdown in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, on those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), following Friday prayers.

It was December 20, 2019, and anti-CAA protests were erupting across the country, nine days after Parliament passed the law. Horrifying accounts of police heavy-handedness were trickling in from U.P. By the time I went to Meerut, a number of Muslim youth had been killed in police action. Hundreds of young Muslim men were forced to go underground as the police brought out FIRs against nearly 2,000 unknown persons, which allowed them to nab anyone they suspected of participating in the Friday protests.

I also met the families of Zahir Ahmed and Mohammed Asif. They too narrated stories of rushed funerals under the barrel of a gun and before the crack of dawn.

“The police arrived late at night and said we had to bury Asif immediately. The family burial ground was a few kilometres away, but they said there was no time to go that far. They said we should take him to the nearest graveyard, which was barely a few 100 metres away. When we arrived at the cemetery, we saw police personnel with spades. A grave had already been dug,” said Asif’s mother-in-law, Shameem.

At the time of the funeral of the three men less than 24 hours after the protest, the post-mortem reports were not available to the families. The police had also named the three dead men in an FIR, and the families had little expectation of a fair investigation by the police against their own.

The parallels between what unfolded in U.P. last December and last week are hard to miss. The family of a 19-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly raped and murdered by four Thakur men in Hathras was also denied permission to conduct rituals and prepare their daughter for her farewell. The police prepared the cremation site, installed a generator and flood lights, and brought logs and fuel. They consigned the young woman to flames in the dead of night without her family’s consent.

Many Kashmiris on social media too have tried to remind the country that this is also their lived reality, but rarely discussed.

As in Meerut, in Hathras too the state has been criticised for its failure to ensure a proper investigation of the ghastly incident and gather forensic evidence in time. A whisper campaign aimed at maligning the victim and her family, including by a BJP leader, and loose remarks that seek to absolve the four accused men indicate that justice will be an uphill battle in an environment where caste hierarchies are deeply entrenched.

Sometimes present-day events allow journalists to see past stories in a new light and identify patterns. From the vantage point of Hathras, it is evident that caste, class, religion and ethnicity can dictate whether dignity in death is an equal right.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xq1ju/article32734732.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hathrasdeathjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/funerals-under-the-barrel-of-a-gun/article32806076.ece
317,2020/10/09,Should Indian startups take on global Internet giants?,"India should compete only when it makes sense, on a level playing field

Online payments company Paytm recently announced that it was building a ‘Mini App Store’ which would ‘empower Indian developers’. This move came days after Paytm was removed from Google’s Play Store over apparent violation of its policies. Though it was reinstated later, Paytm and several other Indian Internet startups allege that Google is using its market dominance to arbitrarily enforce policies and target competitors. The Play Store is the key app store for Google’s Android operating system, which runs over 90% of smartphones in India. Google also announced that it will start enforcing a 30% commission on all payments made for digital services in apps from its Play Store. Though the implementation of this plan has since been postponed to next year, it has caused much heartburn in the Indian startup environment. There is discontent brewing against tech giants in their home country as well, with a similar tussle going on between Apple and some game developers in the U.S., and the government readying an anti-trust lawsuit against Google. In a conversation moderated by P.J. George, Thillai Rajan and Jayadevan P.K. discuss whether the Indian startup ecosystem is ready to take on the giants on whom they are dependent for crucial infrastructure. Edited excerpts:

The Internet startups in India are in the initial stages of banding together to take on the likes of Google and Facebook. Has the Indian startup environment matured enough for such a fight?

Thillai Rajan: Yes, definitely the Indian startup has matured enough. The growth of mobile phones, particularly smartphones, has been significant in the last decade. And as the market has grown, naturally the service providers and the app developers have also grown. So we have an ecosystem that’s very active with a large number of consumers and service providers. What is missing has been the infrastructure piece. But in some ways, we have also been able to develop expertise in infrastructure; for example, on payment gateways. Since demonetisation and other changes, payment gateways have become substantially stronger. Today, I think the Indian startup environment is mature. But one thing we need to be cognisant of is that, if we’re really looking at competing effectively with the likes of Google and Facebook, then we need to be well prepared. We need to build like-for-like capabilities, the way Google has done over the years.

Jayadevan P.K.: India’s startup ecosystem is still in its first innings. The U.S. has been playing this match over and over again. Even markets like China have evolved and raced past India. Just to give you one data point, in the fourth quarter of 2019, you had $34.2 billion of venture capital going into the U.S. market. India had only $6 billion and that’s supposed to be a record-breaking quarter. In the first quarter of 2020, we had only $2 billion. From a product point of view, we don’t have the infrastructure that is required to build and scale nimble startups, at least not yet. For example, a lot of startups are launched on Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud, or on Microsoft Azure. India doesn’t have large infrastructure players that can help set up stuff. Everybody in the Indian startup ecosystem knows that we’re not there yet.

So, do we want to take on these giants? I would argue that we should not compete, but cooperate. It is best for a country like India to have an approach where we compete when it makes sense, on a level playing field; and cooperate and take help from whatever quarters it comes from. Do we need an Indian app store? There is obviously always a case for more competition in the market but an app store is a very tricky challenge to take on. It is the expression of a bunch of things that have come before it, which is your hardware. India has zero strength in hardware. We have practically no real manufacturing or chipmaking. That said, we have companies like Indus OS which have built app stores, and have about 100 million users. That’s a sizeable population, but it’s still not deep enough to be like a Google or Amazon which coexist in an ecosystem like India. So, my view is we don’t need to take a confrontational approach.

Google has a near 100% dominance in the app marketplace in India. What are the implications of the company having such a hold on the Indian market? Is it monopoly, or is it ‘the bigger, the better’?

Jayadevan P.K.: Why does Google work? There is an element of trust that Google’s invested in building up. Its products are user-friendly. It has also spent a lot of time expanding the market by localising its products. So, from that point of view, Google has been investing in the Indian market. Now, from an Indian entrepreneur’s point of view, the concern is legitimate. Are we paying too much to access our own users by giving a 30% cut to Google when you are selling a service or a product through an app on the Google App Store? These companies also have to advertise via Google to reach their customer base. In effect, a large chunk of all the money that these companies make goes to Google and Facebook. The challenge is that India as a market itself is poor, in the sense that it doesn’t have enough spending capacity. For digital services to take off and be profitable and viable, one of the thumb rules that several companies talk about is that the GDP per capita should be above $4,000. For example, in markets like Indonesia, where the GDP per capita recently touched $4,000, companies have also been growing profitably and faster. India is still at about $2,000 to $2,500. So, here your potential to monetise this user is very low. If you end up spending a ton of money on distribution and on your commissions to Google and others, you end up with practically nothing. That’s the challenge that entrepreneurs have been flagging. Google has been reasonable, I think. After the PayTM fiasco, Google has come back and said that it will revisit the 30% commission policy some time next year.

Data | What is the state of startups in India

Thillai Rajan: One of the raison d’etre for businesses is to create shareholder value. The mechanisms by which shareholder value is created keep changing as the company moves across its life cycle. Startup companies create value by being innovative. Bigger companies like Google and Facebook create shareholder value by building barriers that startups cannot afford to create. They have much larger tools in their arsenal to be able to create barriers. One of the tools they use is to buy all competition to ensure that they stay in the market and create shareholder value.

Now, the question is, when does the consumer benefit? Is it going to be in the short term or in the long term? In the short term, the consumers will benefit because as the bigger companies assimilate these innovations, these innovations become stronger and the bigger companies can use their infrastructure to make them available to a larger number of people. But what happens in the long term? As the stickiness of the services increases, and the consumers find it very difficult to break away, there’s something called a creeping expropriation of consumer surplus. Gradually, the billings start rising and consumers end up paying more because there is not enough competition in the market. To overcome these circumstances, the Competition Commission of India and others ensure that the monopoly position is not being abused by companies. For example, they can ensure that the companies don’t overcharge or they can ensure that the companies are split into different smaller entities. It is going to be a very dynamic interaction between the size of the companies and the regulatory framework in countries to ensure that the competition as well as the consumers benefit.

The Department of Justice in the U.S. is gearing up for anti-trust action against Google. What is the best play for the Indian government in such a scenario? Is it stricter regulation or is it better to leave it to the markets and hope an Indian giant develops to take on the Silicon Valley giants?

Jayadevan P.K.: Companies like Google or Amazon also do not operate like a foreign entity. They have set up base in India and have a stake in the market; which means they also work with policymakers. I would like to think that it’s good to have these foreign competitors who are willing to abide by local laws. We also cannot have too much of reactive policymaking against them as it doesn’t signal well for attracting foreign investors. Also, it is a slippery slope to be nationalistic about products that are built for the Internet, which is global. If we create a very strict policy environment which encourages only local Indian innovation and tries to stave off foreign competition, I suspect we are going to end up with subpar products, and large industrialists capturing policy.

It’s a very tricky balancing act, where you have on the one side investments that these larger companies are making and on the other side, you have to think of Indian companies. Now, the truth is that a lot of these Indian companies are also funded by Chinese or U.S. investors. So, it’s not as easy as saying ‘I’m an Indian company and I want regulations for India.’

Thillai Rajan: We cannot just hope for it to happen. There has to be a conscious strategy. In the technology sector so far, in the Indian context or even in Silicon Valley, the role of the government has been very little. We could probably take the example of what the government in China does. Specific technologies and companies that developed these technologies are chosen; and then there is unwavering support from the government. The government does it in multiple ways, such as giving domestic startups favourable access to the market, giving them an opportunity to grow and to stabilise their offerings. There is a conscious strategy to develop a giant that can compete with the global leaders. Today, we are looking at these kinds of long-drawn-out strategies in other areas; for example, in winning gold in the Olympic Games. People are trying to put a programme in place so that we just don’t hope that an athlete or a sportsperson will win a gold, but we are able to work towards that in a very planned manner, so that the results are there in a time frame that we have chosen. I think that is a good way to go up against Google.

Also read | Why are Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple facing antitrust issues?

However, you cannot compete with what Google is today. Because, it may take us, let’s say, five years to be where Google is now; and in five years, Google would have moved away from what it is today. So to be able to compete with Google, we will have to be where Google is going to be five years from now. That requires significant time to plan and execute our strategies. Then it is not a question of this or that — but doing both. If there are any antitrust actions globally, join those right now or provide overt support to ensure that dominant positions are not misused. At the same time, create a programme to ensure that we are able to create an Indian giant.

318,2020/10/09,Winning back trust in vaccines,"The FDA and pharma companies are taking steps to address concerns about COVID-19 vaccines

While U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that a COVID-19 vaccine would be available by mid-October, days before the November 3 presidential election, the guidance for ‘Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19’, released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has dashed that possibility. The FDA has made it clear that “data from Phase 3 studies should include a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen to help provide adequate information to assess a vaccine’s benefit-risk profile.” However, the guidance for industry contains non-binding recommendations.

Shutting the door

With at least two months of follow-up data likely to become available at the earliest only by November or December, the guidance essentially shuts the door on vaccine manufacturers making their vaccines available for public use through the emergency use authorisation route before election day. Dr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and CEO of Pfizer, had on earlier occasions said that the company may have vaccine data ready to submit to the FDA in October.

Also read | COVID-19 vaccines must have at least 50% efficacy, says Drug Controller

The FDA guidance comes after the White House had blocked its release due to concerns that the guidelines would delay the arrival of the first dose until after election day. Even as Mr. Trump called the FDA guidance release as “just another political hit job”, Dr. Peter Marks from FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research told CNN that “being open and clear about the circumstances” under which emergency use authorisation will be issued for COVID-19 vaccines is “critical to building public confidence and ensuring the use of COVID-19 vaccines once available”. He added that the FDA hopes that the guidance on COVID-19 vaccines “helps the public understand our science-based decision-making process that assures vaccine quality, safety and efficacy for any vaccine that is authorised or approved”.

The unprecedented speed at which COVID-19 vaccines have progressed to Phase 3 trials and the haste shown by the Trump administration to get a vaccine out before election day have eroded public trust in COVID-19 vaccines that are undergoing trials. A Gallup COVID-19 tracking survey carried out in the U.S. between July 20 and August 2 found that 35% of Americans did not want to be vaccinated even if an approved vaccine was available at no cost. Similarly, CNN polls found the percentage of people willing to be vaccinated dropping from 66% in May to 51% in October. People unwilling to be vaccinated include those who are otherwise inclined towards vaccines.

Building trust

The FDA’s initiative to build public trust in COVID-19 vaccines is one of the many steps taken by stakeholders to address the concerns about new vaccines developed and tested at speeds unknown before. In September, nine vaccine manufacturers came together to sign a joint pledge to assure the public that they would develop and test COVID-19 vaccines in accordance with “high ethical standards and sound scientific principles” and always keep the “safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals the top priority”. They clarified that they would not seek premature approval from regulatory authorities.

In an unprecedented move, three pharma companies — Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca — published the Phase 3 trial protocols to inform the public and scientists about the evidence companies will use to determine if vaccines are effective.

Finally, in an open letter to colleagues, Pfizer’s Dr. Bourla said he “can’t predict exactly when, or even if our vaccine will be approved by the FDA”, and that the “world will be safer if we stop talking about the vaccines’ delivery in political terms.” He wrote: “Let’s continue to work together to build trust in science. Imagine the compounded tragedy if we have a safe and effective vaccine that many people didn’t trust. That is a risk none of us should accept.”

That the FDA is not buckling under pressure from the Trump administration for quick clearance may go some way in winning back the trust that people are losing in COVID-19 vaccines.

319,2020/10/09,Scissoring the DNA: On Chemistry Nobel,"The huge potential of the gene-editing tool decided the chemistry Nobel

That scientists who pioneered the revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology, the biggest game-changer in biology in recent years, will win the Nobel Prize was never in doubt; it was only a question of when and who would get recognised for the work done to develop the tool. The Prize awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna, just eight years after they developed the tool, has finally ended the speculation of who would win it. But most importantly, this year’s Prize for chemistry has created history by honouring an all-woman team. It all started when Dr. Charpentier discovered an RNA molecule that is part of bacteria’s ancient immune system — CRISPR-Cas — wherein clustered repeated sequences produced by bacteria can remember and destroy viruses by cleaving their DNA. Teaming with Dr. Doudna, she recreated the bacteria’s genetic scissors in a test tube and simplified the tool to make it easier to programme the system to precisely cut specific sites of interest in any DNA, including humans. While the tool is most often used to make a cut in the DNA, newer approaches are being attempted to add or make minor changes to the DNA. All these approaches may at some time in the future make it easy to “rewrite the code of life”.

The gene-editing technology has opened up a vast window of opportunity. In the last six years, the tool has enabled scientists to edit human DNA in a dish and early-stage clinical trials are being attempted to use the tool to treat a few diseases, including inherited disorders/diseases and some types of cancer. Though in 2016 China began the first human clinical trial to treat an aggressive form of lung cancer by introducing cells that contain genes edited using CRISPR-Cas9, the use of the tool has so far been limited to curing genetic diseases in animal models. Last year, a Chinese researcher used the tool to modify a particular gene in the embryo to make babies immune to HIV infection, which led to international furore. Though no guidelines have been drawn up so far, there is a general consensus in the scientific and ethics communities that the gene-editing technique should not be used clinically on embryos. Unlike in the case of humans, the tool is being extensively used in agriculture. It is being tried out in agriculture primarily to increase plant yield, quality, disease resistance, herbicide resistance and domestication of wild species. The huge potential to edit genes using this tool has been used to create a large number of crop varieties with improved agronomic performance; it has also brought in sweeping changes to breeding technologies. The gene-editing tool has indeed taken “life sciences into a new epoch”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/scissoring-the-dna-the-hindu-editorial-on-2020-nobel-prize-for-chemistry/article32806854.ece
320,2020/10/09,Avoidable uncertainty: On RBI monetary policy statement,"Appointment processes for critical financial policy roles need an overhaul

The Reserve Bank of India will release its third bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2020-21 on October 9, instead of October 1 as originally envisaged. This will be at the culmination of a three-day review of the pulls and pressures in the economy by the monetary policy committee (MPC). The review began on Wednesday instead of September 29, after the RBI had to reschedule it on the eve of the meeting following the government’s failure to appoint its three nominees to the six-member committee. This is the first such instance of the RBI deferring its bi-monthly review in recent years. That the terms of the government’s first set of MPC nominees would expire at the end of August was known from the time it was constituted four years ago. Also, the MPC’s meeting schedule is released by the central bank in April. Even if the hunt for new members was disrupted by the pandemic, the government had ample time to expedite these appointments after August 6, when the last policy review took place. The new members — academic Ashima Goyal with interests in the interplay of fiscal and monetary policies, noted agriculture economist Shashanka Bhide, and former SEBI member and financial markets scholar Jayanth R. Varma — are unexceptionably good picks who would lend a holistic world view to the MPC’s deliberations. However, for their first meeting, they would have had effectively just 24 hours to prepare.

In normal times, one could put this avoidable delay down to bureaucratic lethargy, but these are not normal times. A lot has transpired since the last policy review; official data revealed a 23.9% contraction in the economy in Q1, jobs and incomes remain under pressure, and inflation continues to reign above the 6% upper limit of the price stability mandate agreed to in 2016 by the RBI and the Centre, which entailed the setting up of the MPC. The government has for now stuck to its ₹12-lakh crore borrowing plan, which includes space for ‘unforeseen’ spending. Also, States need to borrow more in the coming months including to meet GST compensation shortfalls. An almost casual approach towards continuity in such an important policy review body, at a time when markets are keen to know India’s fiscal and monetary stance and the RBI’s inflation and growth projections for the year, is unacceptable and sends a clumsy signal to global investors. Some lateral thinking may be needed to conjure up fresh stimulus measures for the stuttering economy, but policy mandarins should not lose sight of routine decisions. With the last two RBI Deputy Governors’ vacancies being filled after protracted gaps of about six months each, appointment processes, especially for critical financial policy roles, are clearly in need of an urgent overhaul. And the government could surely burnish its standing among investors if it mandated explanations and strictures for missed timelines as part of such a revamp.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/avoidable-uncertainty-the-hindu-editorial-on-rbi-monetary-policy-statement/article32806856.ece
321,2020/10/09,Mantri Developers gets SWAMIH fund to complete ‘Mantri Serenity’,"It is the maiden beneficiary of special window to ensure completion of stalled projects in the affordable housing/mid-income category

Bengaluru-based Mantri Developers, on Friday, announced its plan to revive its residential project ‘Mantri Serenity’ in the city, having been chosen as the maiden beneficiary of the ₹25,000-crore SWAMIH Investment Fund, which is a special window formed by the Union government to ensure completion of stalled brownfield projects in the affordable housing/mid-income category.

However, the company did not disclose the size of the funding it received.

The fund pertains to the construction and completion of a project called Mantri Serenity catering to 3,000 homebuyers, on Kanakapura Main Road. It was started in 2012 but had stalled.

Homebuyers had recently registered a criminal complaint against the promoters and were also pursuing litigation at the Real Estate Regulatory Authority – Karnataka.

The funding comes less than a month after Bengaluru South MP Tejaswi Surya intervened on behalf of homebuyers and wrote to the Ministry of Home Affairs urging steps to suspend passports of the promoters of Mantri Developers.

The MHA had referred the MP's letter to the Passport Seva Programme of the Ministry of External Affairs for “urgent appropriate action”.

On Friday, Mr. Surya said that in the interest of 3,000 families, he had requested Finance Minister Nirmal Sitharaman to sanction SWAMIH funds for completion of the project.

‘Last-mile funding’

Irfan A. Kazi, Chief Investment Officer, SWAMHI Fund, SBICAP Ventures, said, “Our mandate is to provide the last mile of funding required to complete affordable housing projects to ensure delivery of homes to buyers. We do not disclose the size of individual funding.”

With this, Mantri Developers hopes to turn the tide in the real estate market, which has been affected by a financial slowdown.

Sushil Mantri, Chairman & Managing Director, Mantri Developers, said, “With this financial closure of last-mile funding, we will be able to speed up the remaining construction and reach an early completion of the project so that we can deliver homes to our customers in the next 12-24 months, in phases.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mantri-developers-gets-swamih-fund-to-complete-mantri-serenity/article32816324.ece
322,2020/10/09,Civic body comes out with a report card for waste segregation,"The information is available on the BBMP’s SWM portal and will be updated regularly

H.S.R. Layout, H.B.R. Layout, Hongasandra, Kadu Malleswara and Nagapura are the top five wards that have been segregating waste at source while K.R. Market, Sampangiramanagar, Sunkenahalli, Bharatinagar and Nagawara fared the worst.

In a first, the Solid Waste Management Cell of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has ranked wards, divisions and zones on their effectiveness in segregating waste. While the data released is for the month of August, BBMP’s Special Commissioner (SWM) D. Randeep said the civic body will be undertaking this exercise every month. It will be an exercise of self-reflection for citizens who can see how they fare when compared to other areas, he said.

The information is available on the BBMP’s SWM portal and will be updated regularly.

Mr. Randeep said that no ward had reached 70% segregation of waste at source. This, he said, was one of the main reasons for more waste being sent to the landfill than the processing plants.

For the assessment, the BBMP took into account the quantum of segregated wet waste collected and transported to processing plants, frequency of secondary transportation vehicles transporting wet waste to the plants, quantum of mixed waste going to the landfill and frequency of secondary transportation to the landfills.

Each parameter has been given specific weightage. Another set of rankings have been arrived at by accounting for fines levied by the junior health inspectors in the various wards for SWM violations.

According to data made available on how zones fared, Bommanahalli zone secured the first place, followed by Dasarahalli, Yelahanka, Rajarajeshwarinagar, West, South, East and Mahadevapura zones. With regard to division-wise ranking, Bommanahalli secured the first place, followed by Mahalakshmi Layout, Bengaluru South, Kengeri and Byatarayanapura. The last five ranks were secured by Jayanagar, Mahadevapura, Chamarajpete, Shivajinagar and Chikpete divisions.

He added that the performance ranking of many wards will change in September, as new garbage tenders are being implemented. “In wards where the new garbage tenders are in place, there is already mandatory collection and transportation of segregated waste,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/7biho5/article32816149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGSWMP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/civic-body-comes-out-with-a-report-card-for-waste-segregation/article32816150.ece
323,2020/10/09,BMTC set for trial run of e-bus,"The vehicle is being provided by a Hyderabad-based company

After a gap of over six years, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is conducting another round of trials of electric buses. This time, a Hyderabad-based company named ‘Olectra’ has provided an e-bus for the trial run. The Corporation is waiting for clearance from the Transport Department before starting the trial. “We may operate the bus for one month,” said an official.

As part of the trial, the Corporation plans to run buses to Electronics City, Kadugodi, Kempegowda International Airport, among other places. In the coming days, the BMTC will also be receiving e-buses from Ashok Leyland and JBM.

In 2014, the BMTC ran trials with an e-bus manufactured by a China-based company. The bus was operated for four months on Bengaluru’s roads to assess various parameters, including the passenger experience. The Corporation wanted to procure the bus, but the high cost quoted by the company – about ₹2.5 crore – proved to be a deterrent.

For the last six years, the BMTC has been attempting to include electric buses in its fleet, but has not been successful, missing deadlines one after another.

An official said, “There has been a lot of progress in the technology over the years. We have to make sure that the e-buses meet our specifications, such as energy consumption, carrying capacity and how it performs on busy roads.”

The AC electric bus provided by the Hyderabad-based company for the trial run is 12 metres long, has seating for 37 passengers and can run up to 180 km on a single charge.

“During the trial, passengers will not be allowed to board the bus. We will use sandbags to assess how the bus runs with different load factors. We will also use heavy traffic roads, routes having flyovers and grade separators,” the official said.

The BMTC hopes to lease and operate 300 e-buses under the Centre’s FAME 2 scheme. It had recently cancelled the tender process as it was not financially viable, and sought an extension in the deadline from the Centre to float tenders.

Sources said the government has given the extension and fresh tenders will be floated in the coming days. According to the BMTC official, the tender evaluation is under process to lease another 90 e-buses under the Smart City project. These nine-metre buses will be operated as metro feeder services.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/7ssdom/article32816088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGBUSP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bmtc-set-for-trial-run-of-e-bus/article32816089.ece
324,2020/10/09,"Ranga Shankara to present Kannada play online, will remain closed this month","Ranga Shankara is rebooting its ‘Staged@RS’ programme from October 10 onwards to present plays exclusively recorded for online streaming. Staged@RS was launched in May with some recorded plays for children that were staged under AHA! - Theatre for Children.

The second phase of the programme kicks off with the Kannada play, Sankramana, directed by Surendranath S., featuring Sihikahi Chandru, Kalpana Naganath and B.V. Shrunga. Sankramana is the Kannada version of the Hindi play Sankraman, written by renowned playwright Kamtanath. The play, in three monologues, portrays the generation gap in a middle class family in Karnataka strained by tortured relations. It has already been staged over 50 times.

“This is the first time we staged the play exclusively for an online audience with multiple cameras,” says Surendranath, who is also Ranga Shankara’s artistic director. His experience working in television and cinema came in handy. “It was different, nevertheless. As theatre artistes, you are accustomed to certain things. For instance, you pause for a bit, waiting for the audience to react. And now, there is no audience.”

Though the government has permitted theatres to reopen with 50% seating capacity from October 15, Arundhati Nag, Ranga Shankara’s founder, is concerned about safety. “We are not going to open this month. Even with half occupancy, I am not sure if it’s safe for people to be inside an enclosed space yet.”

“Until we open, we are planning to reach our audiences through the Staged@RS programme.” Sharanya Ramprakash’s Akshayambara and Abhishek Majumdar’s Desdemona Rupakami are among the next plays in the line-up.

Sankramana will be available to stream from October 10 to 18.

325,2020/10/09,BBMP seeks UDD approval to maintain 12 high density corridors,"The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has written to the Urban Development Department seeking permission to maintain and develop 12 high density corridors in the city.

Earlier this year, it had been decided to hand over these corridors, measuring a total of 191 km, to the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Ltd. for development and maintenance. The civic body would have been required to pay maintenance and development charges amounting to ₹1,120.48 core over five years.

In the letter, civic chief N. Manjunath Prasad has maintained that the BBMP’s Road Infrastructure department was already maintaining 474 km of arterial and sub-arterial roads in the city, which includes these 12 high density corridors.

The BBMP, in association with DULT (Directorate of Urban Land Transport), was also creating bus priority lanes and pop-up cycle lanes. That apart, in the case of road widening, the BBMP can issue TDR, which KRDCL could not, he pointed out.

In the light of these reasons, the commissioner has argued that the 12 major roads be handed back to the civic body for maintenance and development. He suggested that an ESCROW account could be opened for their maintenance and development.

With regard to DPRs being prepared by KRDCL for road development, Mr. Prasad has suggested that they be re-examined by DULT. He has also sought release of grants already earmarked under the ‘Capital Support to Speical Infrastructure Project of Bengaluru’ for the development of these 12 high density corridors.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-seeks-udd-approval-to-maintain-12-high-density-corridors/article32807837.ece
326,2020/10/09,"Patients who undergo heart surgeries return to normal life, a week after treatment at Chennai hospital","The private hospital’s investment in a Hybrid Cath Lab made it possible to perform surgery and stenting at the same time, said the surgeon

Sanjay, 54, V. Ramesh, 44, and M. Narmada, 70, all of whom have recovered from a heart attack, are now leading normal lives. All of them had blocks in multiple arteries requiring bypass surgeries. But they were offered an advanced technique, which reduced their hospital stay to just three to four days. In fact, Mr. Sanjay has returned to work already.

All three patients had been admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for just a day, and to the regular ward for another day. On the third day, they were discharged and put on a cardio-rehabilitation programme.

This was made possible thanks to the hybrid cath lab facility that Kauvery Hospital has invested in, said R. Anantharaman, senior consultant interventional cardiologist.

Mr. Ramesh had a history of heart attack and blocks in the right and left coronary arteries. His heart function was only 30%. Conventionally such patients would have to undergo a coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, which requires surgeons to open the chest cavity. The patient would have to undergo two procedures. Not only would this mean longer hospital stay but also the risk of infection during the ongoing pandemic.

The surgeon decided to perform a hybrid revascularisation procedure wherein a 3-4 cm incision was made on the left side of the chest and the main bypass grafting for the left coronary artery was done. After checking its functioning through angiography, the surgeon then inserted a stent through angioplasty in the right coronary artery.

“Undertaking a complex procedure and enabling the patient to walk back home within a span of two to three days is a huge step in treatment and provides a lot of hope for patients with such conditions. We were able to perform this with the aid of the Hybrid Cath Lab that can facilitate the procedure to be performed in a single stage -- both surgery and stenting at the same time,” he said.

The procedure could be offered to patients who would not be able to withstand an open bypass surgery, he added.

The hospital’s executive director Aravindan Selvaraj urged people not to postpone treatment for fear of infection. There were enough advancements in medicine that could provide not only relief, but also help them lead normal lives, he said.

Mr. Ramesh said his health insurance firm covered the procedure.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/patients-who-undergo-heart-surgeries-return-to-normal-life-a-week-after-treatment-at-chennai-hospital/article32813845.ece
327,2020/10/09,"Containment zones go up in Chennai, following surge in COVID-19 positive cases","There are now 70 streets declared as containment zones by the Chennai Corporation

As COVID-19 positive cases are increasing in the city, the Chennai Corporation is simultaneously increasing the number of containment zones. The number now stands at 70.

The civic body, which had discontinued barricading of streets last month, resumed the containment zone strategy in places where the number of positive cases is higher than three on a particular street.

Containment zones, which stood at only 10 in the first week of October, increased to 42 and have now touched 70. Ambattur zone that has 50% of the containment zones still tops with 29 streets. Tondiarpet in north Chennai which had no containment zones when the practice was resumed, at present has 11 streets barricaded as part of COVID-19 prevention measures. The number of positive cases in Tondiarpet zone has been increasing over the past week with more than 500 cases. All other zones have less than five containment zones.

A senior official of the civic body said the zonal officials who have been given the freedom to block streets, are putting up containment zones based on the feedback from local officials to prevent the spread of the virus.

A senior official of the civic body stressed that residents had the wrong notion that the COVID-19 pandemic was over when the Corporation stopped barricading streets, and members of the public discontinued the wearing of masks and following of safety norms.

The Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) plans to construct an overhead tank to provide round-the-clock water supply in east Velachery. An amount of ₹10 crore has been allotted, and Adyar zone officials are engaged in getting a vacant plot of land from the Greater Chennai Corporation, along with drawing up an estimate for executing the project.

329,2020/10/09,An effort to help persons with disabilities get back to work,"A disability rights organisation in Chennai has tied up with Loyal Textile Mills, to sell masks

If you see a person with a disability selling masks near you then you, then perhaps you could buy one. It would help their family rebuild their lives.

In the past week, around 25 such persons have been gainfully employed across the city and in the suburbs, thanks to the efforts of P. Simmachandran, president, Tamil Nadu Differently Abled Federation Charitable Trust, as well as of Loyal Textile Mills.

It all started through a social media post by D. Devadas, Chief Technology and Business Development Officer of the company. The post was read by Bengaluru-based Lakshmi Ravishankar, of Inclusion Beyond Abilities Trust. While the company was hoping to give jobs to those who had lost their livelihood during the COVID-19 pandemic, she suggested that the company choose persons with disabilities to sell their masks.

“We have made masks that are functionally equal to global standards,” said Mr. Devadas, adding the company had started developing the mask after a Central government-organised meeting in Delhi in January. “We have been doing a B-to-B with companies instead of giving it to retailers. Ms. Lakshmi contacted me after seeing my post on Facebook. She suggested that we contact Mr. Simmachandran and support people with disabilities,” he said.

Mr. Simmachandran arranged for 23 persons, who owned either a tricycle or two-wheelers, who could travel as well as sell the masks.

In an event organised on October 2, which is also the death anniversary of the Mills’ former chairman and managing director, Manickam Ramaswami, the project was launched in the presence of Information minister T.K. Raju, in Chennai.

The company has provided persons with disabilities the initial capital, and a few hundred masks to sell. In the last four days these persons have fanned out in various parts of the city and have also managed to garner large contracts for the company.

It is not all rosy for the disabled sellers, however. They often face harassment from either Corporation officials or the police.

“A young disabled woman who was selling the masks at the Aynavaram bus stand was threatened by the police and chased away,” said Mr. Simmachandran.

He recalled that a disabled woman who was running a tiffin centre from a push cart near Rajaji Bhavan lost her livelihood as the Corporation officials seized her vehicle a month ago. He fears the mask sellers could suffer a similar fate.

There are some practical difficulties as the sellers have to travel to one of the several show rooms of the company to procure the masks when they get bulk orders. “The company has said it would take over the distribution but they are wary of losing the commission they earn,” Mr. Simmachandran added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/duo49x/article32811428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09OCTTH--Disabledjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/an-effort-to-help-persons-with-disabilities-get-back-to-work/article32811429.ece

332,2020/10/09,Chennai Metro’s weekday traffic sees an increase,"The number of passengers has gone up to nearly 25,000

A month after resuming services, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has pulled in office-goers on Anna Salai. There is a two-fold increase in the number of passengers travelling on weekdays.

From 12,000 a day, the number has increased to nearly 25,000. Yet, this constitutes just 20% of the pre-COVID-19 traffic when 1.15 lakh passengers used the services every day.

The airport, High Court and Meenambakkam stations receive the maximum number of passengers. Nearly 2,000 passengers use the airport station, and the High Court and Meenambakkam stations handle nearly 1,800 and 1,600 passengers respectively.

Earlier, the stretch from Chennai Central to St. Thomas Mount would have more passengers than the Washermanpet-airport section. But the Washermanpet-airport stretch carries a majority of passengers now, sources said.

According to CMRL officials, since most of the government employees have returned to offices, they travel through the stations on Anna Salai. Hence, the stretch from Washermanpet to the airport through Anna Salai now carries more traffic.

“Take for instance, AG-DMS, LIC, Government Estate or Madras High Court, there is a gradual increase in the number of people using these stations. As air traffic has improved, we are seeing a mild increase in the number of users at the airport station. But since the airport’s parking fee is very high, many coming from suburbs like Tambaram or Pallavaram head to the Meenambakkam station, leave the two-wheelers there and travel,” an official said.

With no IT travellers, the stretch between Chennai Central and St. Thomas Mount suffers from poor patronage, officials said.

Data show that a maximum of nearly 6,300 passengers travel between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. and another 6,300 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. These two hours in the morning and in the evening account for nearly 25% each of the total ridership.

“Since we don’t have many taking early morning or late night trains or buses, there are only 200-220 commuters from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. and from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., only 100-150 passengers travel.

333,2020/10/09,"Bank executive held for identity theft, novel fraud","He used fake credentials to siphon money with a credit card

An engineering graduate, employed in the credit card division of a leading private bank in Chennai, has been arrested by the Ambattur cyber crime cell for committing financial fraud.

The 28-year-old accused, Karthikeyan, working as a customer executive at the bank’s branch in Vadapalani, had meticulously planned and transferred ₹10.36 lakh from a man’s credit card to a bank account opened in the name of another person.

Explaining the modus operandi, Deepa Sathyan, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ambattur, said Karthikeyan used a mobile he found on the road to open a current account in the name of one Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Medavakkam, in a small bank in Valasaravakkam, showing Mr. Kumar as a proprietor of a firm and also obtained a merchant point of sale (POS) machine. “Citing the lockdown, he convinced Mr. Kumar to complete the KYC verification via video call without raising suspicion,” she said.

Later, he contacted Iruthayaraj, a nursing assistant in Mangadu and a credit card customer at his workplace, and misled him into applying for a credit card.

Karthikeyan then obtained the relevant details to use the credit card and used the POS machine, obtained in Mr. Kumar’s name, to charge ₹10.36 lakh.

When Mr. Iruthayaraj received the credit card bill for the transaction, he approached the bank and learnt that he had been cheated. He then lodged a complaint with the police.

The police traced the transaction to Mr. Kumar. When he denied any wrongdoing, the police traced the phone number registered with the bank and found that it belonged to a woman, who had lost her phone eight months ago. They later found that the accused had used the same number to contact Mr. Iruthayaraj.

“Yes, we are back home. But there is no cause for celebration. We are saddened by his death. He did not resurface after getting into the water to anchor the boat against cyclonic winds. He has two school-going children, and their education and future must be taken care of by the government,” said K. Raghu, the boat driver.

The fishermen, who arrived from Delhi after COVID-19 tests, said they thought they could return by sea, which was why they wanted to ensure the safety of the craft. “But despite our best efforts, it sank. The boat-owner, too, has lost over ₹70 lakh... The government should consider some kind of relief for him too,” he added.

Recalling the ordeal, the men said they had turned off the engines after casting the net, as was their practice. But when they tried starting it the next morning, it did not work. The battery ran down while they tried to repair the craft after which communication devices, too, stopped working. “The rations lasted till the 28th day after which we caught some fish now and then and ate them boiled. Then, on some days, it was just plain water,” said V. Parthiban, another fisherman.

C.K. Rajkumar, the founder of Sujatha Biotech and the man behind several brands including Velvette Shampoo and Nivaran 90, died in a private hospital in Chennai on Wednesday. He was 67. He is survived by his wife, son and two daughters.

A qualified doctor, he was widely known for his sachet concept, which gave an affordable option to middle income families. He was called the ‘sachet pioneer’. “Our father (Mr. Chinnikrishnan) was doing this shampoo business and was into packaging goods. But it was Rajkumar who made the sachet popular in the market,” said, C.K. Kumaravel, CEO and co-founder of Naturals Salon and Spa and brother of Rajkumar. He is also the brother of C.K.

“In the early 1980s, Velvette had a marketing tie-up with Voltas. In the late 1980s, Rajkumar took a bold decision and met Adi Godrej of the Godrej Group. That was the defining moment of the sachet revolution,” Mr. Kumaravel said. Mr. Godrej immediately took up marketing and distribution of Velvette shampoo and the regional brand went national.

After Velvette, Rajkumar moved on to Nivaran 90, a cough syrup sold in sachets, and Memory Plus, a memory enhancing herbal pill. Then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao launched Memory Plus, and chess player Vishwanathan Anand was roped in as its brand ambassador.

337,2020/10/09,Keeping vigil even during unusual times,"With corruption likely in pandemic management, the CAG’s audit can ensure checks and balances in the health sector

The latest India-specific data on COVID-19 infections is alarming. With the nation spending substantial resources to manage the pandemic, what is the role of the supreme audit institution of India, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India?

In this context, the move, in August, where the Karnataka State Legislature’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) directed the CAG to conduct a special audit into the purchase of COVID-19 equipment within 15 days, and where the PAC chairman H.K. Patil ‘chaired a meeting of the panel and instructed the CAG to constitute a special team of its employees to get the audit of all purchases of COVID-19 equipment’ highlights the role and significance of the national audit office in these unusual times. The panel also asked the CAG to ‘conduct an audit of expenditure incurred by the State government under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The government had used the SDRF amount for purchase of equipment in various districts’.

Opportunity for graft

The political allegation that funds (to the tune of ₹2,000 crore) were siphoned off to purchase inferior quality of personal protective equipment kits, sanitisers, ventilators, masks and other equipment at prices higher than those prevailing in the market is a serious one. The opportunity to indulge in corruption exists in disaster management. Emergency procurement to save lives and reduce sufferings are a chance to obfuscate rules and procedures, and can happen in all three tiers of governance — the Union, the States and Union Territories, urban local bodies, rural local bodies and government agencies engaged in procurement at all levels. Mr. Patil has also petitioned the Karnataka State Human Rights Commission alleging the violation of rights of people during treatment.

If all the major purchases by government entities at all levels are audited by the CAG, there can be substantial improvement in disaster management. It will usher in better transparency, integrity, honesty, effective service delivery and compliance with rules and procedures and governance.

A constitutional mandate

The CAG has the inescapable constitutional and statutory mandate and responsibility to ensure public accountability, transparency, effective service delivery and good governance. The management of a pandemic is not an exception to this; though in the expediency of saving lives and alleviating suffering, there can be reasonable exceptions to compliance with established rules and standard operating procedures in procurement. People’s health is a priority audit theme and so is big-ticket public expenditure.

The CAG has issued an order creating a new vertical — health, welfare and rural development on June 1, restructuring the office of the Director General of Audit, Central Expenditure. It is necessary that the CAG undertakes performance audits of COVID-19 related procurements, the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Employee State Insurance (ESI) hospitals. Audit objectives may include the procurement of equipment and drugs for CGHS wellness centres and polyclinics, laboratories and hospitals. For example, based on available reports, the CGHS provides health-care facilities to about 34.19 lakh beneficiaries, including government employees, pensioners and MPs, incurring an expense of ₹5,113 crore, almost half of its total expenditure on drugs from 2014-15 to 2018-19. A beneficiary survey will become part of the audit process to bring out efficacy of service delivery and the availability and quality of drugs. Auditing ESI hospitals and dispensaries is expected to provide the assured health-care services including infection control and hygiene.

The government entities must have established and effective controls over expenses to purchase equipment. Since the lockdown, there has been substantial government expenditure. Audit recommendations can contribute improvements in various aspects of disaster preparedness, management and mitigation.

As in the rules, all governments and government agencies must have established effective controls over disaster preparedness and management and related expenses (with proper documentation). As the CAG’s performance audits are driven by economy, efficiency and effectiveness, the audit will focus on expense tracking and achievement of outputs and outcome, in qualitative and quantitative terms. The entire process of procurement of COVID-19-related equipment and drugs, proper documentation, and compliance with rules and regulations can be streamlined with data analysis, valuable inputs and practical recommendations.

Benefits of an inspection

There are usually red flags in disaster management, emergency procurement and related expenditures. Though COVID-19 is an unparalleled disaster, it may also provide an opportunity for scamsters to siphon off public money where normal and prudential financial regulations cannot be fully enforced and questions of inconsistencies are likely to be overlooked.

The statutory responsibility of CAG as an independent, objective, and non-partisan constitutional authority includes appraising disaster preparedness, ensuring that management, mitigation operations, procedures are complied with, and proper internal controls are in place; ensuring that there are proper records, documentation, authentic, accurate, reliable and complete information and data; providing assurance to people’s representatives, tax payers and the public at large that government resources, including funds and assets are being used prudentially as per the law and regulations and safeguarded; providing assurance that risks are assessed, identified and minimised with established disaster management process and procedures; and, finally, offering assurance that resources are being used economically efficiently and effectively for achieving the planned objectives and that benefits have gone to the targeted beneficiaries.

The internal audit must also ensure compliance with applicable rules and procedures even in disaster-related disbursements and procurement processes and provide valuable inputs to the external audit conducted by the CAG. Generally accepted government auditing standards require that an audit is planned and performed with sufficient, appropriate evidence to the audit findings and conclusions based on the audit objectives and scope. All public entities management must be accountable and ensure that resources are managed properly and used in compliance with laws and regulations; programmes are achieving their objectives; and services are being provided efficiently, effectively, and economically.

338,2020/10/09,"Hathras, a new phase in the caste atrocity narrative","The caste-rape itself has been brushed aside; instead, the responses to it are being labelled as instigating a caste war

The gang rape that took place recently in Bul Garhi, a tiny village near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, marks a new phase in the eventful history of rape-as-caste-atrocity in the 21st century. The idea of the caste atrocity is itself a product of the last quarter of the 20th century. The new republic took some time to realise that nothing is changed by granting passive legal rights to people who are actively treated as unequal. This is especially true when the responsibility for the enforcement of these new rights rests mainly upon those who believe that the old inequalities are part of their legitimate caste-inheritance.

Criminalising the ‘legitimate’

A provisional answer to this dilemma emerges through the notion of the caste atrocity, and a new law — the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (https://bit.ly/2SCkW1Q) . The Act highlights the truth that an extraordinary law is needed to criminalise practices that were considered ordinary and legitimate not so long ago. The term “atrocity”, like its predecessor “untouchability”, is not defined in the law, which only refers to a list (under Section 3 of the Act) of practices — ranging from extremes such as being forced to eat excreta, to varied forms of routinised humiliation and discrimination, including economic boycott, social exclusion, sexual violence and political disenfranchisement.

Hathras gang rape | A long caste feud, a horrific crime, and a sudden cremation

The difficult process of redefining (some) traditional practices as modern crimes is where we must begin in order to understand the place of rape within the larger spectrum of the caste atrocity. In rural society, the sexual “availability” of lower caste women to upper caste men is included in the intangible forms of caste capital that go with tangible forms such as land or wealth. Tensions arise when intangible caste entitlements begin to meet resistance rather than resignation. Upper caste outrage at being robbed of an inheritance is forced to adopt an oblique dog-whistle kind of language that must, paradoxically, deny the relevance of caste and highlight the agency of the lower caste woman, albeit in biased ways. In response, lower caste rage against accumulated humiliations is compelled to insist on the perennial presence of caste and its unique pathology above all other co-morbidities. These reactions are neither equal nor symmetrical.

Patterns of denial

Contemporary thinking on caste-rape was jump-started by the infamous 1995 judgment of the Rajasthan High Court in the Bhanwari Devi gang rape case, which held that upper caste men could never rape a lower caste woman because they would not touch her. By explicitly invoking caste to deny rape, the judgment provided an instructive and stark contrast to the persistent denial of caste in rape cases involving Dalit women, especially after the Prevention of Atrocities Act came into force.

The classic instance of caste denial was the Khairlanji case of 2006. Anand Teltumbde’s (The Persistence of Caste: The Khairlanji Murders & India’s Hidden Apartheid) careful reconstruction establishes the undeniable centrality of caste in the ongoing enmity between Surekha Bhotmange, a Mahar woman, and her Kunbi opponents. Surekha’s assertiveness and the upward mobility of her family had narrowed the social distance between the two castes to a level that was unbearable for the dominant Kunbis. Following the horrific sexual assault and murders of Surekha, her daughter and two sons, the Nagpur High Court judgment insisted that it was a revenge killing that had nothing to do with caste.

Hathras gang rape | Upper caste group holds meet in support of accused

The ‘Nirbhaya’ impact

The next phase in the evolution of caste denial arrives with Delhi’s ‘Nirbhaya’ fatal gang rape in December 2012. Between 2012 and 2013, neighbouring Haryana witnessed a relentless succession of rapes, gang rapes, sexual assaults and murders of Dalit women and girls, significant enough to be reflected in National Crime Records Bureau data. Public and media responses to the Haryana rapes were muted in the face of all the attention to the Delhi gang rape, but they were not silenced, as they had been initially in Khairlanji. Haryana did see local mobilisations by Dalit activist groups and support from some Delhi-based Dalit and women’s organisations. Several cases were successfully filed despite opposition from the all-powerful Jat community, to which most of the accused belonged. A common tactic of the accused was to try and turn every rape case into one of consensual sex, and every murder into suicide. This was accompanied by the denial of caste regardless of the identity of victim or perpetrator. When out of court settlements or compromises failed, caste details were invariably removed from the records, and the Prevention of Atrocities Act was not allowed to be applied.

The recent Bul Garhi case seems to be breaking with earlier patterns. In an eerie coincidence, its as yet unnamed victim died on September 29, exactly 14 years after Surekha Bhotmange and her children were killed on September 29, 2006. In continuity with the past, we have a Dalit (Balmiki) young woman allegedly raped, battered, maimed, and left to die by dominant caste (Thakur) men, and the familiar initial attempts at cover-up and denial. But everything else is a contrast.

The State’s response

Instead of acting as passive facilitators for the accused as they have usually done, the police here take on the role of an active accomplice. In what later proves to be a decisive moment, they forcibly cremate the body and do not allow the family to conduct the last rites. This shockingly heartless act triggers a wave of revulsion, and conversely, a surge of support for the dead victim and her family. But the truly stunning performance is that of the State Chief Minister who stands caste denial on its head by claiming that protests against the incident are acts of sedition, part of a foreign-funded conspiracy to foment caste riots, motivated by jealousy of his State’s development record. Cases are lodged against every political party that organised a protest, but public meetings in support of the accused are allowed. Just as the Haryana cases were in the shadow of Nirbhaya, the Bul Garhi case is part of the larger context defined by the post 2019 Modi-Shah 2.0 regime. So it is surprising, but not unbelievable, that the tactics being used against the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests are being deployed here as well.

Editorial | Grapes of wrath

Some hope

This is a new trajectory. The caste-rape itself is brushed aside without comment, and it is the responses to it that are accused of instigating a caste war. There are, however, some unprecedented positives. An anonymous dead woman has invited mass identification with a Dalit cause for the first time since Rohith Vemula. Moreover, Dalit women’s voices have a prominent place in the protests. And finally, the Bul Garhi caste-rape-murder has triggered the first mass demonstrations since the anti-CAA movement. This is going to be a long and interesting century.

339,2020/10/09,"Letters to the Editor — October 9, 2020","Quad dynamics

On the Australia-India-Japan-United States Quadrilateral, or the Quad, the goal must be long-term architecture for the region (Editorial, “Four for one”, October 8). India ought to discount for now the idea of establishing a wing akin to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization till deeper bonds take root among the four, and perhaps to add in time a couple more. The entity should better stay an economic platform — a fair riposte to China’s Belt Road Initiative — as each of the four members would need to stay heavily engaged with China on trade.

The Quad is an opportunity to cultivate countries in the South East Asian arena, to collaborate on initiatives that they may not be able to accomplish on their own. And that could be the first phase of engagement. As the Quad acquires political overtones, it could manifest itself as a security umbrella for the region.

Science that matters

Gene editing is deserving of the Nobel Prize. Reading genomes has now progressed extremely rapidly, taking just hours. What was once just a sci-fi writer’s dream is now a reality. Though welcome as a potential new tool in the fight against diseases, it does come with ethical concerns. Many countries have no legislation on genetic modification in reproduction. It is for our leaders, scientists, ethicists and legal experts to plan how India should be a part of this revolution.

The applications of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology in different areas including biotechnology, medicine and basic research are unlimited. However, a carefully balanced approach needs to be taken by the international scientific community to look into the prospects, limitations and ethical issues when it comes to tinkering with the genomes of different organisms.

Politics and corruption

Those who have even elementary knowledge of political corruption in this country are unlikely to be excited over the report, “Bungalow, estate owned by Sasikala, kin attached” (Page 1, October 8), even if estimated to be valued at ₹2,000 crore. Though Ms. V.K. Sasikala is undergoing a jail term in a disproportionate assets case, one should remember that the case ended without any effective warning for ‘future corruption’. Public perception is that many politicians and a few others continue to accumulate assets that are disproportionate to their known sources of income. A truthful auditing at an impartial level of everyone’s assets must be a regular feature. In the case of politicians, it should be conducted at least for the last 50 years — a Utopian suggestion.

Dismal IPL match

In the Chennai Super Kings-Kolkata Knight Riders IPL match in Abu Dhabi (‘Sport’ page, “Super Kings lose the plot, Knight Riders hold their nerve”, October 8), there is no doubt that CSK lost from a winning position. At the crease, Kedar Jadhav was all at sea. He played 12 balls, that is, two overs, and scored just seven runs. As a four-down batsman, in his place, Mahendra Singh Dhoni should have asked Dwayne Bravo to come in.

Dhoni exited from the crease when his presence mattered the most. It was only these players who scored runs: Faf du Plessis, Shane Watson and Ambati Rayudu. Ravindra Jadeja’s innings was like a flash in the pan — too little, too late. Dhoni needs to ensure that CSK pulls up its socks.

K. Pradeep,

One fails to understand how a batsman like Kedar Jadhav is a part of the team despite his lacklustre performances. On the other hand, the highest wicket-taker of the last IPL, Imran Tahir, is unable to find a place in the team. There is no point in CSK coach Stephen Fleming fuming in the pavilion; he needs to share the blame with MSD for the mess so far.

“We are very modern,” Satnam aka Sunny Sethi’s (Vikrant Massey) father (Rajiv Gupta) insists. He adds to good effect, “We have an automatic car and mobile phone with 4G.” This, when matchmaker Shobha Juneja (Ayesha Raza Mishra) calls him outdated for not thinking about whether the bride-to-be might have her own career dreams, as opposed to partnering in the family’s restaurant business that’s yet to take shape.

A few such witty segments perk up the unlikely romance between Sunny, and his school-time crush Ginny (Yami Gautam) who he always thought was too good for him. One never knows. All it takes is a mother who can sense that her daughter isn’t moving on from a now-yes now-no confused relationship with her ex and hopes that an unassuming Sunny can win her heart.

Ginny Weds Sunny Cast: Vikrant Massey, Yami Gautam

Direction: Puneet Khanna

Streaming on: Netflix

It’s matchmaking season on Netflix, where this Hindi film streams. Unlike matchmaker Seema from the web series who goes through catalogues to choose prospective brides and grooms, Shobha (her agency is called ‘Rishte hi Rishte’) has a track record of arranging 100% successful marriages. She takes Sunny under her wings, with the consent of his parents, and sets him up to trail Ginny.

Can love be arranged? The parents and Sunny hope so. The Delhi and NCR romance nods to many things synonymous with Punjabi families — from the popularity of Baadshah and Mika Sigh numbers to lines such as ‘we Punjabis are left with emotions and paneer’ (Navjot Gulati and Sumit Arora share the writing credits).

However, apart from a chuckle here and there, the fun fizzles out after a point. The film has a slim storyline and once Ginny’s ex, Suhail Nayyar as Nishant, halts the budding romance between Sunny and Ginny in its tracks, the rest of the film is extremely predictable. And boring. There’s nothing much the charming leads can do. Vikrant and Yami are convincing in their given characters but these aren’t their best performances.

Shobha Juneja gets some good moments in the film and shines through.

Most wedding rom-coms may not aim to create a lasting impression but try to entertain you while it lasts. But Ginny Weds Sunny felt long and tiresome even with its 125-minute duration.

A few years ago, our family had the worst emotional crisis — dealing the loss of a dear one. I lost my aunt — my mother’s sister — who was battling cancer for at least 10 years. Somewhere we knew she was going to fade away, but were trying to manufacture hope. I remember the time when the doctor pulled us out of the tyranny of that empty room, to say she was slipping away and to come to terms with reality. We were prepared, but never fully prepared to face the music, to face grief.

Death.

It is a harbinger of hope and despair; The End as well as a beginning, for some; an absolution from the sentence and a punctuation to the succeeding paragraph — a full stop, if you will.

Of course, I cried that day, more so when I realised I had no recent recollection of my aunt; she was physically away and was on a vacation to the US, before she went to a place far from reach. My immediate, instinctive response was to go through the WhatsApp messages and the audio notes she sent me, and boy oh boy, did that break me!

What does our personal loss have to do with Dick Johnson Is Dead? That is what the documentary does to you; it forces you to look deep inwards, and reflect. There could be nothing worse, nothing more cruel, than deleting the contact of a loved one, more so if you are plagued by life’s greatest blessing and a sin: memory.

In the documentary, filmmaker Kristen Johnson takes up a subject that is the worst fear of every child: coping with the feeling of losing your parents, more so their memories. Halfway through the film there is a portion which has stock footage of Kristen’s mother, who died of Alzemiers and who tries to recollect who Kristen was and where she is, at the moment. “I have been a documentary filmmaker for 30 years and this is the only footage I have of mom,” says Kristen, with a crack in her voice.

One suspects it was this footage that, perhaps, drove Kristen to make a documentary on her father, for, through the film, she not alone preserves the memories of them but accepts death, as theory and as form. She captures every bit, every last detail of her father Richard Johnson — there are shots of him taking a nap; savouring his favourite chocolate fudge, of his gestural movements; his hands and feet, of his mere existence inside and outside of the camera — who is a psychiatrist and is in the last quarter of life. He has dementia and the condition worsens when his memory begins to give up on him, forcing the intervention of Kristen and he moves in with her.

Dick Johnson Is Dead Cast: Richard Dick Johnson and Kirsten Johnson

Director: Kirsten “Dick” Johnson

Storyline: Documentary filmmaker Kristen Johnson stages and films the death of her father (Richard Johnson) — in a playfully whimsical fashion that is fantastically affecting yet cruel at once — giving him a painful death each time, only to resurrect and preserve his memory, when he is actually gone one day, someday.

Runtime: 89 minutes

She paints a tender, heart-rending portrait of her father through Dick Johnson Is Dead, which is hilarious, moving and contemplative about life and death. The humour is acidic but humane at the same time — this would not have been possible without a sport that is Richard Johnson. His face radiates calm and serene, always carrying a charming smile making the documentary all the more effective and affecting. Though equally enthusiastic and overwhelmed by the process of filming his own death as Kristen, there are moments when Johnson is off and sad, perhaps, contemplating the inevitability and yet living with the weight of the present reality.

Kristen and Johnson are Adventists. According to Seventh-Day Adventism, the dead have to wait to be resurrected to heaven — “She kills me multiple times. I am the resurrected dad,” says Johnson to a stunt performer, who has come to suggest a mode of death, for the shoot. She coaches her dad to die; writes his death sentence, killing him softly but painfully. For instance, he takes a stroll when a box drops on his head and dies at the spot, one time. In another instance, he takes a fall from the stairs, while Kristen asks him to adjust his hand a little for the camera.

Every time Johnson dies, Kristen *cuts* the camera, which means she is also cutting the link between what is real and fantasy. The manner in which she kills her father might seem cruel, but you could sense how hard, how troubled she must have been to lose her father.

She only reveals bits of Johnson in the film, and we only see fragments until we form the complete picture of the person he was/is and will be. We come to know of the cardiac arrest he had in 1987 and how he lived for “30 more years”, and how he always felt ashamed of his underdeveloped toes.

What Kristen has achieved through her film is to give her father a fitting farewell, or at least a sense of it, when he is still alive and walking. Which is why the film’s tear-jerking moments come from the artificial scenes — the one where they select a coffin box for him, the one in Heaven, where he is performing a ballet with his wife, or where we see Christ healing his toes with water. In one scene, we literally see Johnson’s spirit lifting.

Perhaps Kristen got it right; death is indeed a celebration of life.

There is something about Dick Johnson Is Dead that made me tear up more than I would, normally. “The deepest fear is of being left behind,” says one of the characters. Though we know that everything is “staged” and “cooked”, it is difficult to look at it as a piece of performance, especially when the grief sticks out and suffocates us. Early on, when Johnson lies in a coffin — even if momentarily and for the camera — his close friend turns his face away from him. “Everybody has to prepare; everybody dies. I know this is a movie and weird stuff, I cannot watch it,” he says.

In the film’s final portion, when everyone comes to bid a parting goodbye, it is Johnson’s friend who delivers the final speech and has an emotional breakdown. “Oh no, he thinks it is all real,” says Johnson, peeping from the outside.

Johnson comes back (LoL) to greet the attendees of his own funeral — something all of us, at some point, have dreamed/thought about. The camera slowly pans to a person weeping and choking on his tears at the corner, unable to accept the feeling of being left alone. It is not Johnson’s daughter, but his friend. Now, who will tell him?

When Prabhjot Singh Anand bit into the limited edition ‘Paan Jeer’ Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate, he felt a twinge of pride. The off-beat combination of flavours was chosen by him, as part of a contest for the brand. “It tasted just as I thought it would,” he says over phone from Mohali.

Prabhjot’s was a winning entry in the first edition of the Go Madbury for Cadbury campaign, which invited people from across the country to send in suggestions for desi flavours.

The campaign was launched in 2019 by Cadbury and over 73 ingredients were listed, from which participants could choose and submit their entries. Anil Viswanathan, senior director – marketing (chocolates), Mondelez India says, “Of course, we had to have the back-end ready with the wacky possibilities that could emerge.”

And a few outlandish combinations did come in – chai and elaichi, kulfi and paan, popcorn and coffee, kulfi and badaam. The most common, however, were classics such as salted caramel, berries, coffee and hazelnut. In contrast, entries from the UK — where the campaign was called Cadbury Inventor Competition — had flavours like Crunchy Honeycomb, which includes chunks of actual honeycomb among other ingredients.

Back in India, businessman Prabhjot says he dug into his childhood memories for inspiration — memories of eating meetha paan during visits to his grandmother’s house and the local anjeer (fig) ice cream that his father used to bring home. Apoorva Ranjan, a content writer based in Bengaluru went for a different combination — her favourite mint and chocolate. Hers was the other winning entry.

“I make mint and chocolate chip ice cream at home, so the idea came from there. But I wanted the mint flavour to be there like an aftertaste. Like when you are eating a piece of chocolate and get a tantalising hint of something that makes the entire experience interesting. When prepared well, mint and chocolate are a classic combination,” she says. Hint O’ Mint, as the chocolate is christened, is already bringing in appreciation, she says.

The digital campaign received over eight lakh entries from India alone, where the final shortlisted candidates were as varied as chai latte, mishti doi and motichur among others.

It was a task, sifting through a sea of creative entries. The R&D team, along with chef and chocolatier Varun Inamdar, shortlisted 100 entries, narrowing it down based on the marketability, creativity and feasibility of the flavours. The winning entries were chosen based on people’s votes too.

‘Paan Jeer’ may be a little bit of an evolved taste, and mint has not been one of the most popular flavours in India. But the response to the flavours has been overwhelming, says Anil. The limited edition bars will be available in the market through October and November. The 36-gram chocolate bars have been priced at ₹45. They can be bought online too, in select locations.

The second edition, Madbury (2.0) plans to go hyperlocal, to include flavours specific to the regions of India. “Bhujiya, for instance. Or how about Mysore pak, desiccated coconut and banana?” asks Anil, adding, “The pandemic has had an impact on business – gifting has come down drastically. But it also presents an opportunity. Snacking has increased and it is time for people to get creative about their snacks.”

The Madubury 2.0 campaign, which was launched in September 2020, will be open till October 30.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/5geotp/article32810347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPRANDOMCHOCOLATEIMAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/cadbury-launches-two-new-limited-edition-bars-after-its-go-madbury-for-cadbury-campagin/article32810350.ece
343,2020/10/09,Maratha leaders bicker on eve of shutdown to demand quota,"Sambhajiraje says MVA govt. must fight to vacate Supreme Court’s stay order

While Maratha outfits have called for a shutdown on Saturday in protest over the Supreme Court’s stay on the implementation of the quota law, prominent community leaders appear to be bickering among themselves.

On Friday, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rajya Sabha MP from Kolhapur, Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje, launched a thinly-veiled attack on other Maratha community leaders like Shiv Sangram president Vinayak Mete and Praveen Gaikwad for merely giving sound-bytes on television instead of actually leading the Maratha activists on the streets.

Considered an influential Maratha community leader, Mr. Gaikwad had attempted to secure a nomination for the Pune Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 general election with the covert backing of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar – an effort which eventually came a cropper.

Mr. Sambhajiraje, who was leading an agitation in Tuljapur in Osmanabad district in Marathwada region, said, “Certain leaders only express their indignation over the apex court’s stay [on the Maratha quota] on television… if they have any courage, they must come forward and agitate along with the people on the streets.”

The MP said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government must put its best foot forward in fighting to vacate the Supreme Court’s stay order on the implementation of the Maratha quota law in the State. “It will not take much time for these agitations presently comprising only thousands to transform into protests with lakhs of seething and disgruntled Maratha community people,” warned Mr. Sambhajiraje.

Meanwhile, the Pune-based Sambhaji Brigade hit out at Mr. Gaikwad as well, while chastising Maratha leaders from the BJP as well as the ruling MVA for using the agitation as a means to gain political mileage.

“Mr. Gaikwad, who is a broker of Sharad Pawar’s NCP, had earlier demanded that the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) exams be held as scheduled on October 11 without any concern for the safety or security of Maratha community students in the time of the pandemic. However, the government has fortunately announced the postponement of the exams, nullifying Mr. Gaikwad’s demands,” said Manoj Akhare of the Sambhaji Brigade.

Brigade leader Santosh Shinde said in reality, certain Maratha leaders from both the ruling party as well as the opposition BJP were using the quota movement for their selfish political ends.

“These leaders are not really interested in fighting for the rights of the communities… they have been propped up by the ruling and opposing political factions to drive a wedge in this agitation. The furore over the MPSC issue was a deliberate diversionary tactic,” said Mr. Shinde.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bu585d/article32816776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BMMARATHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maratha-leaders-bicker-on-eve-of-shutdown-to-demand-quota/article32816778.ece
344,2020/10/09,No objection to increasing frequency of locals: State to HC,"Services may be used by general public provided they wear masks and follow physical distancing norms: govt.

The Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court on Friday that it does not have any objection to increasing the frequency of local trains and even the general public can use the services provided they wear masks and follow physical distancing norms.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a bunch of public interest litigations seeking a direction to the State government to include lawyers among staff rendering essential services so that they can use local trains to attend physical court hearings. At present, only people working in essential services are permitted to use the trains, which are running in limited numbers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said, “The State has no objection now. But people are not wearing masks and do not maintain social distancing. It is almost like people would rather wear an oxygen mask in the ICU bed of a hospital than a face mask covering their nose and mouth.” He added, “The [novel] coronavirus has not booked a return ticket. It is here to stay. Hence, people need to be careful.”

Mr. Kumbhakoni gave the example of late singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, who was infected with COVID-19 “because of a mistake of sharing a mike with another person”.

The Bench had earlier this week suggested the State government to request the Railways to increase the frequency of trains on the Central, Harbour and Western lines. Mr. Kumbhakoni told the court that the government had written to the Railways. The proposal was forwarded to the Railways Board, which has approved it.

The Bench said, “It is the State government’s duty to enforce safety norms and social distancing rules. In the month of March, the novel coronavirus was unknown to us. But now more than six months have passed and we know more about the virus.”

The Chief Justice said media reports indicate a second wave is expected in December and January. “We need to be prepared for the future,” he said.

Chief Justice Datta said, “Survival is of utmost importance. Something needs to be done to ensure that everyone does not end up at the railway station at the same time. For this, the involvement of ministers is required. It cannot be done by just officers. We need to take a holistic approach.”

The Bench has posted the matter for further hearing on October 19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-objection-to-increasing-frequency-of-locals-state-to-hc/article32816759.ece
345,2020/10/09,COVID-19 | Maharashtra expands tele-ICU service to beat virus in districts,"Facility will help patients in remote parts

The Maharashtra government on Friday said it is rolling out the tele-ICU service in a number of districts as it has given effective results to combat COVID-19.

On Friday, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope inaugurated the tele-ICU service for Jalgaon and Akola districts. “We have already started this service in Bhiwandi, Aurangabad, Jalna and Solapur. We are now adding two more districts. The method has been proving effective in curing COVID-19 patients. We aim to bring down the fatality rate to 1% using this,” said Mr. Tope.

A tele-ICU enables off-site clinicians to interact with bedside staff to consult on patient care.

Last month, participating in a video-conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had mentioned about the implementation of tele-ICU method in the State and had said that the government intends to expand the scheme, especially in remote parts which lack medical experts and can help the patients from distant places using latest communication technology.

“State-of-the-art technology must be used to lower the death rate and to save lives. We are concerned about the death rate of corona patients in the State. We aim to bring it down to 1% or even less,” said Mr. Tope.

The Health Minister said that lack of availability of experts in medical field can be compensated using the tele-ICU method. “We have started these services in six districts as of now. But we want to expand the scope of this scheme in all remote areas and primary discussions for the same are complete,” he said. Presently, the scheme is being provided under the Corporate Social Responsibility initiative of Mediscape India Foundation.",,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/dzqr96/article32694383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVIDMAHARASHTRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-maharashtra-expands-tele-icu-service-to-beat-virus-in-districts/article32816737.ece
346,2020/10/09,"Out on bail, contractor arrested for extortion","Pistol and two live cartridges seized

The Panvel City police have arrested a civil contractor, who recently secured bail citing the risk of contracting COVID-19, for threatening to kill a building material supplier if he did not hand over his construction contracts.

Police inspector Shatrughn Mali said Rajesh Kaikadi alias Raja (40) threatened the complainant on several occasions, but on October 4, he pointed a gun at him. “The same day a complaint was filed. We suspect that the accused has threatened many others in a similar way,” Mr. Mali said.

On October 7, a team of 12 personnel reached Mr. Kaikadi’s house in Karanjade at 2 a.m., but he refused to open the door. The police then broke open the door and found him waiting to attack them with a rod.

The police said the accused tried to inflict injuries on his body by banging his head against a window pane when he realised he would get caught. The team finally nabbed him at 5 a.m. A country-made pistol worth ₹25,000 and two live cartridges were recovered.

The accused has been previously arrested in 12 cases, with charges including murder, attempted murder, rape and attacking government employees.

He has also been booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, and was in jail in connection with the murder of Sada Sable, a local leader in Panvel.

The police have appealed to citizens, including developers and building material suppliers, to file a report if they have received extortion calls from the accused.

He has been charged under Sections 385, 506 (2), and 504 of the Indian Penal Code; Sections 3 and 25 of the Arms Act; and Sections 37(1) and 135 of the Maharashtra Police Act.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/out-on-bail-contractor-arrested-for-extortion/article32816724.ece
347,2020/10/09,Four arrested with gutkha worth ₹35 lakh in Mahape,"3 trucks carrying contraband seized

The Anti Narcotics Cell and the Central unit of the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch arrested four people with gutkha worth ₹35.53 lakh in Mahape MIDC area on Friday. The accused have been identified as Priyavrat Abhaykumar Das (29), Munna Shrijanardhan Yadav (28), Jitendra Karthikchandra Das (26), and Akheya Budhadev Khonda (22).

Acting on a tip-off, the police intercepted three trucks carrying the contraband. “The main accused, who had sent the consignment, is yet to be arrested because he has tested positive for COVID-19 and has been admitted to hospital. He was managing the operations from the hospital. We are investigating the source of the contraband and who was supposed to receive such a large quantity of gutkha,” senior police inspector Nivrutti Kolhatkar from the Central unit said.

The police have received information that a man based in Gujarat had supplied the gutkha to the accused. The accused have been charged under relevant sections of the Food Safety and Standards Act and the Indian Penal Code. They have been remanded in police custody till October 12.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/four-arrested-with-gutkha-worth-35-lakh-in-mahape/article32816710.ece

349,2020/10/09,Relationships of convenience,"Friends with benefits take on a whole new meaning as we become chummy with technology

Remember when friends with benefits was a thing? Well, with most of us confined to the odd few square meters, it has changed what the world perceives as beneficial. Straight off the bat I can surmise and tell you this — there are no benefits to be had from leather shoes and skinny jeans… or bras, for that matter.

So what has delivered the most calming and satiating of sensations during these last few months? Humans are infallibly failing in their nature (a paradox, I know), meaning that no matter how well you know someone, chances are you’ll get to know them too well and that is familiarity nobody should have to afford. Dogs are a shade better, but since lockdown happened during the shedding season, they slipped down a few ranks, sadly.

What then has been my karma-positive interactions during these days of deathly dullness, when the only thing more scarce than available work has been the desire to commit to it? I’ll tell you: technology. Electro-thingamajigs — that’s where I’ve ended up parking my faith these last few months. Without them, life would be lifeless.

Headphones: The trick with buying a toy as an adult is that you have to make it sound like a sensible, family-oriented decision rather than a personal whimsical impulse. I think the only reason most grown ups have children is to be able to write off a lot of purchases by misdirecting the attribution. Fair trade, I say. My Jabra 45E headset has helped me seamlessly stay connected, but more pertinently, it has helped me disconnect from the quotidian ennui called family. Nobody talks to you when you have a large headset sat across your head; you don’t even have to switch it on. Just look busy and you can potter about all day as if in the throes of some unending webinar all while enjoying your favourite Dylan compilation, oops, I meant playlist.

Modem: Stomach is passé; the way to anyone’s heart nowadays is through fibre optics routed via WiFi. This inconspicuous device, Netgear Nighthawk as it goes by, lies in one corner of our homes, a footprint no wider than an Idaho potato, and yet is dearer to us than the first draft of our democratic Constitution. The internet has mixed up being lonely and alone so well that today most of us pride ourselves on our personality flaws. When was the last time anyone was chided for being online too long? Hotel, home or hospital, a wide spectrum WiFi is more pertinent than intravenous medicine or running water. You’d sooner slash a man’s jugular than his main fibre connection. In fact, go for the latter and you’ll leave no trace of the crime at all.

Vacuum cleaner: There is no joy in tidying up; even if you fashion yourself after ol’ Freddie and crank out “I want to break free”. Two-and-a-half minutes later you’ll be left wondering what was the point anyway. Well, think of a Dyson V11 then not as a cleaning device but as a philosophy guru. It will bring a sense of purpose to walking around the house trying to suck up dirt. It feels cool, like a new remote control car feels cool. It hums just like Back to the Future told us the future would hum. We all love gadgets more than appliances and this here, it is a gadget-lover magnet. And it leaves the house spotlessly clean, which might also give those darned shed-buckets of dogs a case to win back some favour with me.

350,2020/10/09,Lessons from a pandemic,"Our biggest learning from COVID-19 is that we ought to regain the connect between nature and our built environment, says Anupama Mohanram

Our need for space, natural light, ventilation and access to greenery has never been felt this strongly. Especially for those living in cramped and dense urban settings, forced to stay indoors for the last six months.

Humans are very much a part of nature and access to sunlight and fresh air is not only rejuvenating, both mentally and physically, but also promotes healing.

During the 1918 influenza pandemic, it was found that severely ill flu patients, who were nursed outdoors, recovered better than those who were treated indoors. A combination of natural light and greenery resulted in faster recoveries.

Considering this, it is imperative that our built environment provides us with opportunities to remain close to nature for our own health and wellbeing.

However, we have been destroying that very nature to create our cities and live in enclosed, man-made spaces. Biophilia, according to biologist E.O.Wilson, is ‘an innate and genetically determined affinity of human beings with the natural world’. This connection is essential not only for our health and wellbeing but also for our planet’s sustenance.

The big question, though, is whether this realisation will continue to stay within us even after this crisis is over. Only if it does will the future of urban design result in eco-friendly buildings that exist in harmony with our surroundings.

However, looking at the past, it would not be wrong to assume that it won’t be long before people go back to their fast-paced, frenzied design and construction practices. These systems, unfortunately, do not focus on users but on total built up area and cost.

If we were to ensure our building practices stay healthy, here’s what needs to be done:

Our building codes and regulations should focus on user health and wellbeing and not only on FSI / FAR, setbacks and building heights. Codes will have to mandate minimum requirements for natural light, ventilation and access to green spaces.

Natural and healthy building materials should be promoted. These, along with clean energy, rain water harvesting, waste water management and solid waste management will ensure our cities will last longer. In other words, all new buildings should comply with green building standards.

The building plan approval process should also mandate the owner to tend to his/her surrounding neighbourhood. Streetwise zoning codes should be initiated and enforced prior to awarding plan approvals, wherein each of us are also held responsible for our surrounding environment. For example, regulations should insist plot owners plant trees along their plot.

The study of environmentally-sensitive design practices should be brought in, and, in a much more vigorous manner in architecture colleges. Students need to understand the importance of designing built spaces in harmony with nature.

Most importantly we, as building professionals should continue to educate the public on the importance and need for eco-sensitive building design and construction, their benefits to human welfare and the planet’s health. This ongoing education should be mandatory, lest we forget today’s crisis and remember our lessons when the next crisis hits us.

351,2020/10/09,Hand-knotted carpets and DIY spinning kits,"It is all decor this weekend as flagship stores in Delhi and Jaipur take their handcrafted creations and high-profile collabs online. We review Nila House, Obeetee and Sarita Handa’s new e-commerce platforms

shopnilajaipur.com

Nila House may have gone online a year ago (nilajaipur.com), with a white and indigo colour scheme that echoed the physical space in Jaipur, but, as Alexis Barrell, creative director at the not-for-profit organisation, says, it took the pandemic to “pivot towards a more focussed digital communication platform”. Their new website, launched over a week ago, centres on e-commerce and engagement.

Shop for Nila’s range of homeware — Kerala tea towels to kantha cushions — and fashion. On the site now is Nila Studio’s collab with UK-based designer Anna Valentine. Think sculptural culottes, coats and tees in indigo. The lack of quick view and wishlist options, though, is inconvenient. And be warned, you might encounter a few 404 error messages too (which the team promises to iron out soon).

What we love, however, are the DIY kits. Want to learn handspinning? Buy a spindle, 10 gms of kala cotton and a booklet for ₹620, and sign up for a virtual workshop with artisans from Govindgarh in Madhya Pradesh. Want to be more adventurous? Set up an indigo vat in your kitchen — choose a kit with indigo powder, lime powder, pH paper and other ingredients for ₹1,190. “We are working on creating more educational kits, for everything from leheriya and bandini to dabu,” says Barrell. “We are also making natural watercolour bases that people can purchase along with handmade sketchbooks.”

Up next: Look out for comprehensive, step-by-step video workshops that will “introduce people to crafts like miniature painting, with a master miniaturist who works with natural pigments”. Nila will also soon retail frame looms and yarns.

Obeetee carpets

obeetee.com

The pandemic has been a great leveller, with brands, big and small, heading online for visibility. The 100-year-old Delhi-based brand, Obeetee, is no different, as hand-knotted, hand-tufted carpets reach the masses via a new e-commerce store. Shop by design — traditional, contemporary, abstract or geometric — and by collection on the site that features an animated home page and large, expressive fonts. That being said, customers would greatly benefit from a quick view option or, at the very least, the choice to view each product in a different tab. While you can add to the wishlist, you need to create an account to do so.

Collaborative collections with Indian designers Tarun Tahiliani, Abraham & Thakore and Raghavendra Rathore — that “create an indigenous design language for carpets otherwise dominated by Persian and Chinese motifs”— is one of the brand’s USPs, says a spokesperson. The overall range starts from ₹6,300 (for 5x3 ft polyester dhurries) going all the way up to ₹16.42 lakh for a 18x12 ft wool and cotton hand-knotted piece that took three artisans 422 days to make. Silk carpets go from ₹52,000 to ₹10.8 lakh. There is a monthly edit: October’s is inspired by the red oxide floors of traditional homes and the Pantone shade Island Hazelnut.

Perhaps the most impressive option is customisation. Compared to others who offer similar services — such as Hands Carpets, Jaipur Rugs and The Weaver — it gives more choice to the customer. Pick the pattern, specify dimensions and see how it looks in different pre-set templates (living, dining or bedroom). When it comes to colourways, choose from an extended palette, Obeetee’s signature colours or, if you want it ASAP, from a Quickship set that has over two dozen options.

Up next: Zanzibar, a jute handknotted collection inspired by the elaborately carved doors of the African nation, and a sustainable line of flat weaves using natural dyes.

Sarita Handa home decor

saritahanda.com

With their shop-in-shop and independent stores in Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai being closed during the lockdown, this eight-year-old home linen brand launched their online store last month. This comes as a relief to patrons who earlier had to trawl through various websites to find the exact Sarita Handa product they wanted.

The brand’s signature floral and nature-inspired designs on decorative cushions, bedspreads and fabrics now also include lifestyle products such as handbags, pouches and robe sets. The quick-view option helps when you’re checking out multiple options; perhaps a grid view with two or three products per row would be useful to navigate faster on the mobile site. The current collection, called The Mix — for its use of ikat, suzani and Palampore fabrics along with rug patterns and pick-stitch embroidery — is being promoted prominently. Framed botanical wall art is also available, and the sale section has everything at half price.

The lifestyle products are online-only. Unisex robe sets come with matching quilted slippers in cotton jacquards and matelassé; the totes are embroidered and can be machine-washed; and the pouches are upcycled from the brand’s fabric waste.

The Bharatiya Janata Party has sought action against Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy for his alleged remarks that the Centre was trying to merge the Union Territory with Tamil Nadu.

In a memorandum to Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi on Thursday night, nominated legislator and President of BJP in Puducherry, V. Saminathan accused the Chief Minister of spreading false information.

354,2020/10/09,Opposition playing politics over decision to reopen schools: CM,"Parties staging protests in a bid to tarnish image of government, says Narayanasamy

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Thursday flayed the Opposition parties over their criticism of the Puducherry government’s decision to permit high school students to visit their institutions on a voluntary basis to clear doubts.

“We have made it very clear that students could visit the schools only with the consent of parents. The government has to prepare the students for final examinations in March. And we have made it clear that if any student gets infected [with COVID-19], we will reconsider the decision,” he said in an audio message.

Several States have resumed educational activities for even smaller classes. Even States with much higher numbers of COVID-19 cases have allowed students to visit schools, he said.

“Staging of protests in front of schools by a section of political parties is only an attempt to tarnish the image of my government. They are trying to play politics on the issue,” he added.

Upping the ante against the government on reopening of schools, the AIADMK on Thursday submitted a memorandum to the Lt. Governor on the issue. Party leader A. Anbalagan, in the memorandum, said the government went ahead with the decision despite objections from several political parties.

Besides the AIADMK, the principal Opposition party AINRC was also against the decision to start academic activities in high schools.

Meanwhile, schools in Puducherry and Karaikal regions reopened on Thursday to permit students of Standards IX to XII to visit their institutions on a voluntary basis for taking guidance from teachers, to get doubts clarified, for counselling and other related works in areas outside the containment zones.

The sessions began for students of Standards X and XII while activities for students of Standards IX and XI will commence on October 12. The schools will function only during forenoon, and work for six days instead of five days.

356,2020/10/09,Caseload nosedives to 467 in capital,"A day ago, the district reported the highest single-day spike of 1,182 cases

The capital district’s daily caseload of COVID-19 fell by more than half on Thursday when 467 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The case graph fell from 1,182 which was the highest single-day spike to be reported in the district.

Notably, the testing also fell with 6,514 people subjected to tests during the last 24 hours. As many as 7,520 people had been tested the previous day. However, health authorities were yet to conclude whether the slump in cases could be attributed to the fall in testing alone.

While the district authorities have stated that 349 people acquired the infection through local transmission, they were yet to trace the source of infection in 98 other cases. Fifteen health workers have also been diagnosed with the disease.

Nine more deaths

The death toll rose to 281 with nine more deaths that were reported in the district recently being attributed to the disease. The deceased include natives of Pachalloor (60-year-old), Vallamvettikonam (45), Plavilakkonam (58), Mariyapuram (61), Vizhinjam (36), Santhivila (58), Nalandanada (68) and Palayam (60). The health authorities were yet to identify the native place of a 72-year-old man whose death has been included in the district’s death toll.

Among those who tested positive, there were 135 persons aged above 60 years and 47 children aged below 15 years. The district placed 3,337 people under quarantine on the day. With this, the total number of people being monitored as part of the COVID-19 containment efforts has gone up to 31,100.

Bringing much relief, 1,520 people recovered from the illness on the day, thereby bringing the number of active cases in the district down to 11,800.

Police officers infected

Four officers attached to the Museum police station tested positive on Thursday. With this, the number of police personnel who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the station within a few days as gone up to 24. While the remaining staff of around 35 personnel will be subjected to tests on Friday, the City police is likely to disinfect the premises and deploy officers from other stations until those infected recover from their illnesses.

The headquarters of the Attingal municipality has been closed for three days after a clerk in its revenue section tested positive. While the municipal authorities initially planned to confine restrictions to the wing alone, it was later decided to shut the office entirely. It will resume functioning on October 12.

274 booked

Meanwhile, the Thiruvananthapuram City police continued its crackdown on violation of the COVID-19 protocol. As many as 274 people were booked for flouting guidelines. While 213 people were charged for not wearing masks, 10 violated physical distancing norms. Fourteen drivers were booked for operating services without complying with the rules. The police registered cases against seven commercial outlets. In all, a fine of ₹46,000 was collected from the violators.

District Collector Navjot Khosa issued guidelines for activities under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme. While no such works will be permitted within containment zones, physical distancing norms must be strictly enforced in other places where the activities are permitted. Besides, not more than five people will be permitted to work in a single batch.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/caseload-nosedives-to-467-in-capital/article32807933.ece
357,2020/10/09,"Ganja, hashish oil worth ₹4 cr. seized","Four-member gang trying to transport contraband from A.P. arrested

Four persons were arrested by the Excise officials on charge of possessing ganja and hashish oil worth ₹4 crore near Attingal on Thursday.

The State Excise Enforcement Squad (SEES) led by Circle Inspector T. Anikumar nabbed Riyas and Jaseem of Nagaroor, Faizal of Pavaratty in Thrissur, and Niyaz of Konni in Pathanamthitta. The gang was purportedly caught during an attempt to smuggle 100 kg of ganja and 3 kg of hashish oil in a pickup. A car that apparently escorted the pickup was also seized by the law enforcers at Velamkolli along the Alamcode-Nagaroor road.

In Coimbatore

The four-member gang is suspected to have bought the contraband from Andhra Pradesh.

After transporting the consignment to Coimbatore, they allegedly shifted the drugs to the pickup and remodelled the vehicle so that it would resemble those transporting live chicken. The contraband was intended to be sold among youth in Thiruvananthapuram and elsewhere, official sources said.

Efforts spearheaded by the SEES had foiled several attempts to smuggle narcotic substances through the district of late.

Excise officials had confiscated 500 kg of ganja near Attingal a month ago. The team busted a bid to sneak in 203 kg of the contraband on September 22.

Around 10 people were also arrested during the operations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ebbca2/article32807924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201008-WA0070,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ganja-hashish-oil-worth-4-cr-seized/article32807925.ece
358,2020/10/09,Fabrication units see no benefit from interest subvention scheme,"Ancillaries of BHEL in Tiruchi and nearby districts do not find any benefit from the latest notification by Reserve Bank of India extending validity of the Interest Subvention Scheme for MSMEs till March 31, 2021.

Interest relief of two % is extended to working capital or term loans to the extent of ₹ 1 crore under the subvention scheme, to eligible MSMEs. But the major impediment for the fabrication units in availing the scheme is the stipulation that loan accounts on the date of filing claim should not have been declared as NPA. The scheme clearly states that no interest subvention shall be admissible for any period during which the account remains NPA.

The scheme holds no relevance to the fabrication units that are mostly BHEL’s ancillaries since a majority of the industries are gradually turning into NPAs and the properties are being auctioned by banks.

“The present plight of the struggling ancillary units is that the promoters are not able to obtain stay order from the courts in time for the notices sent by banks under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act,” Rajappa Rajkumar, president of BHEL Small Industries Association, said.

For instance, the banks give only 15 days for the industries that have defaulted on payment to settle the dues. But, the scope for legal recourse does not exist since the cases are not taken up for hearing within the deadline period.

Unfortunately for the MSMEs in Tiruchi region, neither the Central Government nor the State have shown any inclination to sustain their survival.

Desirable outcomes can be expected if representatives of small and medium industries’ associations find a place in the expert committees constituted by the State Government with the specific mandate of bailing out the struggling units. ‘For some reason, it is not happening in Tamil Nadu,’ Mr. Rajappa Rajkumar said.

Sanction of additional loans means precious little for the fabrication industries in the absence of adequate orders. The units that had taken additional loans find themselves in a piquant situation since it has only meant expansion of liability with a lengthier repayment period, with no scope for settling the loans. ‘It is tantamount to slow and agonising death,’ Mr. Rajappa Rajkumar explained.

Unless the BHEL, which has the capability to undertake projects for defence and railways, becomes pro-active in securing orders, there will be no turnaround for the MSMEs in the region, he emphasised.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/subvention/article32815932.ece

361,2020/10/09,More occupancy in Chennai trains,"Passenger occupancy on special trains originating from the Tiruchi Railway Division and passing through Tiruchi Junction has been mixed ever since rail services resumed from September 7.

Three intra-State special express trains presently originate from the Tiruchi Railway Division: the Tiruchi - Chennai express special train via mainline section covering Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai and Chidambaram; Tiruchi - Nagercoil Intercity special via Madurai and Mayiladuthurai - Coimbatore Jan Shatabdhi express special (barring Tuesdays).

The resumption of intra-State rail services on select routes enabled movement of travellers to Chennai and other districts from their respective destinations by the special trains. Occupancy in the day-time Tiruchi - Chennai Egmore special (Train No. 06796) being operated via mainline section was around 77 % in September. This was due to the fact that this was the lone service at present to be run on the mainline section up to Chennai Egmore with stoppages at stations including Thanjavur Junction, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai, Chidambaram and Cuddalore. The occupancy in the Chennai Egmore - Tiruchi special (Train No 06795) via mainline section was a little over 70 %.

As for the evening Mayiladuthurai - Coimbatore Jan Shatabdhi express (Train No. 02083), the occupancy was around 67 % during September, while it was about 57 % on the Coimbatore - Mayiladuthurai Jan Shatabdhi express (02084) last month.

The occupancy in the Tiruchi - Nagercoil Intercity express seemed to be moderate as compared to the other two trains originating from the Tiruchi Division. The sources said occupancy on board the early morning Tiruchi - Nagercoil Intercity special (Train 02627) via Dindigul, Madurai and Tirunelveli was about 43 % in September. It was nearly 46 % in the case of Nagercoil - Tiruchi Junction Intercity special.

The occupancy on the Karaikudi - Chennai Egmore via Tiruchi Junction superfast special via Srirangam, Ariyalur and Vriddhachalam (Train No. 02606) and Chennai Egmore - Karaikudi via Tiruchi special (Train No. 02605) were around 55 % and nearly 52 % respectively in September.

As compared to other trains, the occupancy on the Madurai-Chennai Egmore and Chennai Egmore- Madurai specials being operated via Tiruchi in both directions was much higher. The occupancy in September with respect to the Chennai - Madurai superfast special (02635) was around 80 %, while it was about 79 % in the case of Madurai - Chennai Egmore superfast special. All special trains were being operated only with reserved coaches, said a railway official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/trains/article32815621.ece

363,2020/10/09,Water released from Authupalayam Dam,"Photo in NICA

KARUR: Water was released for irrigation for the second consecutive year from the Aathupalayam dam, located at Karvazhi village near K. Paramathi in Karur district, on Friday. The reservoir has an ayacut of 19,500 acres.

Transport Minister M. R. Vijayabaskar opened the sluices and showered flowers on the water flowing from the reservoir along with Collector T. Anbalagan, Public Works Department, Rural Development and Revenue officials and farmers.

The dam, which was inaugurated in 1992, was constructed to harness surplus flood waters in the Noyyal river and the water draining from the Lower Bhavani Project (LBP). However, down the years, the Aathupalayam dam became a repository of polluted water and sludge carried by the Noyyal river from the dyeing and bleaching factories from Tiruppur and Coimbatore districts.

Following a court order, the dam was not opened for 18 years. Last year, water was released from Authupalayam Dam after a court case was withdrawn. The water was released after analyses of samples found that the Total Dissolved Solids level was well within the permitted level.

Water has been released from the dam this year too following good storage. As on Friday, the dam had a storage of about 224.34 million cubic feet (mcft) as against its full capacity of 235.52 mcft.

Farmers in Anjur, Thukkachi, Karvazhi, Thennilai, Munnur, Athipalayam, Kuppam, Punnam, Manmangalam, Vettamangalam, Punjai Pugalur, Punjai Thottakurichi, Athur, Punjai Kadambakurichi, Kuppuchipalayam, Minnampalli, Kathaparai and Panjamadevi would benefit from the water release.

Mr.Vijayabhaskar said that some of the canals carrying water from the dam have been desilted. Renovation works were also taken up on the Authupalayam Main Channel at a cost of ₹1.49 crore.

DRDA Project Director S.Kavitha, Assistant Executive Engineer, Noyyal River Basin, Subramanian and other officials were present.

364,2020/10/09,‘Revamp bad roads leading to fish market’,"Vendors attached to the Puthur Fish Market will sell their wares from the newly constructed Kasivilangi market, set up by the Tiruchi Corporation from Saturday onwards. The market, built at a cost of ₹ 3.32 crore, has 24 retail shops and nine wholesale shops.

All vendors, who had been selling at allotted shops at Puthur, have got shops at the Kasivilangi market, on Kuzhumani Road. After vendors shift, the market in Puthur will be demolished and construction of a commercial complex will soon begin. Some vendors began sales from the new market on Wednesday when it was inaugurated.

Meanwhile, a section of residents, led by CPI Urban District Secretary Suresh on Friday petitioned the Assistant Commissioner, K. Abishekapuram Zone, Tiruchi Corporation seeking relaying the road leading to the market as it was in a bad state. The road, which would be frequented by trucks transporting goods to and from the market would worsen, they said.

“The road from the Nachiyar temple to the market is about a 1.5 km stretch. The road there is filled with potholes and is uneven,” Mr. Suresh said. The civic body could expand its size to benefit residents and vendors, he said. Trucks from the southern districts and Andhra Pradesh ferry fish to the market. “If the road is not repaired soon, the residents will suffer,” he said.

Officials at the assistant commissioner’s office said that the matter would be taken to the attention of the Corporation Commissioner soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/cni9vj/article32818897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY10FISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/roads/article32814855.ece
365,2020/10/09,Delay in acquiring land for service lanes criticised,"There have been loss of several lives in the absence of service roads, say residents

People turned up for a demonstration, led by Tiruverumbur MLA Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi , at Ariyamangalam on Friday in response to a call by Federation for Retrieval of Tiruchi Palpannai-Thuvakkudi Service Road, to register their protest against the delay in acquiring the land for laying service roads along the city stretch of Tiruchi-Thanjavur Highway.

Functionaries of the joint action committee of Federation of Ellakkudi Township Welfare Associations and other welfare associations questioned the delay on the part of the office of the Special DRO/Land Acquisition, National Highways, Tiruchi, in taking appropriate steps, citing the directive issued by the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court during October, 2019, after hearing a writ petition filed by the Federation, that land must be acquired within six months.

The High Court had directed that land must be acquired to a width of 60 metres for overbridges, 50 metres at locations identified as bus stops, and 45 metres at other places along the 14.5 km stretch from Palpannai to Thuvakkudi. The Project Director of NHAI-Thanjavur had even issued the Revised Land Plan Schedule during April this year.

The functionaries flayed the ‘token act’ by the office of DRO Land Acquisition for issuing advertisements in local newspapers for acquiring a mere 68 cents of land for the project, though there have been loss of several lives due to accidents in the absence of the service roads.

‘This constitutes just one per cent of the land required to be acquired for the project,’ S. Sakthivel and S. Subramaniyan, organisers of the federation, said, demanding issue of an advertisement in keeping with the Court ruling within 15 days. The land must be acquired on a rapid pace and compensation must be awarded to the owners within two months, they emphasised, calling for initiation of coordination work by the NHAI with other departments for smooth implementation of the project.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/mqt1ll/article32818883.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY10RALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/road/article32814783.ece

Appearing for the State, Advocate-General S. Sriram said he did not have any objection if the court wanted the CBI to ferret out the facts, while insisting that the government was not responsible for the references made to the judiciary through social media.

He was responding to the observation by the Judges that if the case was not handled properly, they would be forced to rope in the CBI to expose those who made the derogatory remarks and the circumstances under which they stooped so low as to touch on the personal lives of some judges.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/hc-favours-cbi-probe-into-comments-on-judiciary/article32808041.ece

373,2020/10/09,10 held for bid to encash CMRF funds using fake cheques,"Accused attempted to draw ₹117 crore in Delhi, West Bengal and Karnataka

The State CID police reportedly picked up six persons of Karnataka and three from West Bengal in the multi-crore Chief Minister Relief Fund (CMRF) fraud attempt unearthed in Andhra Pradesh and neighbouring States, a few days ago.

On September 20, the Thullur police registered a case on the scam, which was later transferred to Crime Investigation Department (CID). The government directed the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials too to investigate the case as accused tried to draw the amount from the CMRF, in the Secretariat.

Investigation officers reportedly rounded up Udaya Shetty, a resident of Kantavara, Brijesh Rai of Mangaluru, Yogish Acharya of Moodbidri, Gangadhara Rao and two others of Karnataka. Three others were also picked up in the case from West Bengal, and hunt is on for the remaining accused in the scam.

More arrests

The Kadapa police arrested Bhaskar Reddy, who withdrew ₹9.95 lakh, from SBI Proddatur branch, using three cheques issued in the name of three different persons under CMRF.

“The CID, ACB and the Kadapa district police visited Karnataka, West Bengal and Delhi and arrested a few members of the gang. More arrests are likely to be made in the CMRF fraud,” a senior police official told The Hindu.

Miscreants deposited a cheque dated September 9, 2020, for ₹52.65 crore, in favour of Advaitha VK Hollow Blocks and Interlock, in Moodbiri SBI Branch, Mangaluru. Two other persons deposited a cheque dated September 7, in favour of Sharma Forcing for ₹39.85 crore and another cheque dated September 14 for ₹24.65 crore to Mallabpur People Rural Development Society. The two cheques were deposited in different banks in West Bengal.

During verification, the bank staff alerted the State Bank of India (SBI) personnel of Thullur and Vijayawada, who asked to stop payment, and later confirmed that all the three cheques were fake.

The bank authorities confirmed that the miscreants prepared fake cheques, forged the signatures of the officials, used seals of different departments and tried to encash about ₹117 crore. Following a complaint lodged by P. Murali Krishna Rao, Assistant Secretary to Government (Revenue department), the police registered a case and took up investigation.

Joint probe

As per the records of the Secretariat officials, the three cheques were issued to Kolli Rataiah for ₹16,000, Konatham Hymavathi for ₹45,000 and Pathuri Hymavathi for ₹45,000 from November 2019 to June this year. Police visited the houses of the original beneficiaries and recorded their statements, as part of investigation.

It’s a joint probe. Teams of the AP CID, visited the bank branches in Mangaluru, Delhi and West Bengal, observed the CCTV footages available in the banks, account details and other particulars, submitted by the accused in the banks.

374,2020/10/09,Tourism Department chalks outplan to rope in stakeholders,"Process of ‘trade registration’ under way in Chittoor district

After a six-month lull due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Andhra Pradesh Tourism has chalked out an action plan to involve the hoteliers, tour operators and other stakeholders to go in for ‘trade registration’ with the department in a move to provide quality services to tourists.

The Tourism sector, which witnessed the zero-presence of tourists at all its projects in Chittoor district, except the Tirumala temple, is now limping back to normal.

Tourism Manager (Chittoor) D.V. Chandramouli Reddy has told The Hindu that in the wake of COVID-19, tourists are bound to think of their safe travel, boarding and lodging. “It’s exactly here we want to play the crucial role. As Chittoor holds ample tourism potential with its vibrant presence of temples, scenic waterfalls and hill station Horseley Hills, we want to provide the right guidance to tourists in these aspects. Our action plan is that hoteliers, tour operators, lodges and service apartments are roped in to get registered with us. This trade registration on our official website www.aptourism.gov.in has already commenced. The tariffs are just negligible, that too for longer periods, based on the specified categories,” says Mr Chandramouli Reddy.

The trade registration will allow stakeholders to furnish their details, facilities they are offering with permitted tariffs, besides allowing them to post their links. “This will be welcome to tourists to have prior information about their travel, boarding and lodging, with emphasis on adhering to COVID-19 rules,” says the official.

Apart from Tirupati, the tourism wing has plans to involve stakeholders in all prominent destinations such as Srikalahasti, Kanipakkam, Madanapalle and Kuppam. “As we are expecting the arrival of tourists from January, we would be taking stock of the situation at premier destinations such as Talakona and Horseley Hills and improve the facilities. Now, as per out statistics, the present footfall of tourists stands at 20,000 per day. We are expecting the return of full potential by March next,” he says.

Chandragiri opens

Meanwhile, the famous Chandragiri Fort, 10 km from Tirupati, has opened to the public from October 1. However, the ticket issuance is made digital through QR Code payment. The visitors are made to compulsorily go through the COVID-19 rules such as sanitisation, face masks and physical distancing at the tourist spot, according to Mr. Chandramouli Reddy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/ylu1dx/article32807997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJCHTOURISM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/tourism-department-chalks-outplan-to-rope-in-stakeholders/article32807998.ece
375,2020/10/09,Swarna Palace fire: victims’ kin question police ‘inaction’,"10 persons died in the hotel-turned-COVID care centre run by Ramesh Hospitals

Family members of those who died of asphyxia in a fire accident that took place in a hotel-turned-COVID care centre in the city have expressed concern over what they called the “inaction of the police and slow pace of investigation into the case.”

Ramesh Cardiac and Super Speciality Hospitals Pvt. Limited had taken lease of Hotel Swarna Palace for running a COVID care centre. Both the managements had reportedly entered into a MoU for the purpose.

On August 9, at around 4.45 a.m., fire occurred in the first floor of the building, which later spread to the other floors.

Ten patients admitted to the COVID care centre died of asphyxia as thick smoke engulfed the rooms in which they were undergoing treatment. Twenty-one other persons suffered injuries.

The Governorpet police registered a case. The government and the district Collector ordered an inquiry into the tragedy separately. The police arrested three staff members of the Ramesh Hospitals.

However, the hospital authorities said the management was in no way responsible for the accident as the hotel management should look after the safety and security of the patients.

The Revenue, the Police and the Fire personnel who visited the hospital said the accident took place due to non-availability of fire alarm, fire-fighting gadgets and emergency equipment in the building.

Ramesh Hospitals management obtained stay from the court, which was vacated in the higher court later.

“We have seized some important documents. A few suspects are not cooperating in the investigation. But we have recorded the statements of some persons,” a police officer said.

The family members of a few victims, however, blamed the government for the “poor action against the accused.” They alleged that the accused were freely moving outside due to some loopholes in the system.

Poser to police

“How can the police take up investigation without questioning the prime accused in the case and how can the accused escape from the police for more than a month,” a family member questioned.

A senior police officer said investigation into the case was nearing completion.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/ujyjzh/article32807810.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJSWARNAPALACE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/swarna-palace-fire-victims-kin-question-police-inaction/article32807811.ece

377,2020/10/09,"Crops in over 6,000 hectares damaged","4,977 farmers in Anantapur district bear the brunt of excess rainfall

Excess rainfall in Anantapur district during the four months of the south west monsoon led to inundation of 11 types of agriculture crops in 6,016.82 hectares spread over 43 mandals. The crop damage has affected 4,977 farmers.

According to Joint Director of Agriculture Ramakrishna, a ground-level survey conducted by the Department of Agriculture in the last one week showed that groundnut crop in 3927.15 hectares spread over 144 villages in 40 mandals was badly damaged and the department will recommend for compensation based on the percentage of loss.

While agreeing that the total yield would come down in groundnut, Mr. Ramakrishna said that excess rain in September did the maximum damage leading to the germination of pods. With regard to the groundnut crop, 3,139 farmers were affected and their crop details were enumerated. All of these farmers had crop insurance too, which was a saving grace.

The second most affected crop was cotton in 30 villages of 12 mandals belonging to 1,393 farmers, who had sown in 1719.35 hectares. The majority of the crop damage was in Peddavadaguru, Gooty, and Pamidi mandals. Paddy in 21 villages of 11 mandals belonging to 277 farmers sown in 222.33 hectares was damaged.

The other crops like maize, ragi, jowar, castor, redgram, bajra, greengram and millet (korra) were damaged in small areas.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/crops-in-over-6000-hectares-damaged/article32807631.ece
378,2020/10/09,‘Chitravathi’ to impound water to its full capacity,"Settlement of payment to the project-affected paves way for the process

The Chitravathi Balancing Reservoir (CBR), a multi-purpose project, is set to impound water to its full capacity of 10 tmcft for the first time, this season. All this is now possible because the State government has released ₹240.52 crore as a one-time settlement to all project-affected and the online payment began on Wednesday. The project has originally been designed as the tail-end reservoir for Tungabhadra High Level Canal (HLC) with 4 tmcft allocation but never got more than 2 tmcft any year.

While the compensation for the lands and houses was being given from 2006 onwards in phases, the last time any payment was made was in 2009, when the installation of all the gates was completed after the installation process began in 2005. For the past week, the district administration has been working overtime to finalise the list of 1729 project-affected persons and served them Form-C notices, said District Collector Gandham Chandrudu.

While ₹49.2 crore was transferred on Wednesday (confirmed by the beneficiaries), ₹75 crore on Thursday another ₹20 crore on Friday would be paid. “The villagers are getting prepared to vacate their houses within the next week to 10 days so that impounding of water could be taken up immediately,” said Mr. Chandrudu. Currently, the CBR (named after the first MLA of Pulivendula Penchikala Basireddy, the PBR) has 6.5 tmcft and about 2,800 cusecs of floodwater was being let out as impounding would inundate four villages in Anantapur district.

When Government Order was issued recently releasing the amount for the final settlement for the loss of houses and structures due to inundation in Marrimakulapalli, Chinnachagalarevu, Raghavapalli, and Peddachagalarevu villages, several issues cropped up regarding the quantum of compensation, and all those were amicably settled and ₹10 lakh was being given every loser. “There were some attempts at manipulating the Aadhaar data to become eligible for compensation as a major, but the alert district administration foiled them. Ssome people (22 of them), who were given Indiramma houses in the past, but no construction was taken up, also will get the full quantum of ₹10 lakh,” the Collector explained.

Major fillip

The project would be a major fillip to the six drinking water projects in Anantapur district some in Kadapa district in addition to irrigating 1.05 lakh-acre ayacut, project Executive Engineer Urandur Rajasekhar told The Hindu. Out of this only 5,000 acres is in Yellanur mandal of Anantapur district, while the rest is in Pulivendula in Kadapa district. Three fishermen societies having 500 members from both districts operate in this reservoir and export tonnes of quality fish. Dharmavaram, Puttaparthi, Pulivendula, Dharmavaram Rural, Kadiri Town and Rural drinking water projects get water from this.

“Once the floodwater flow from Chitravathi ceases, a five-stage 1,500-cusecs lift scheme from Gandikota Reservoir will fill the CBR bringing in Penna and Krishna water to this project,” Mr. Rajasekhar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/u34my6/article32807621.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09ONGRESERVOIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/chitravathi-to-impound-water-to-its-full-capacity/article32807622.ece

Six persons, including two women and a minor girl, suffered injuries when a gas cylinder exploded in a house at Sabbavaram area in Visakhapatnam district on Friday. The condition of a 45-year-old woman is said to be critical.

381,2020/10/09,Allipuram market vendors oppose collection of daily cess,"They seek payment of ₹10,000 a month for the losses incurred in the wake of coronavirus pandemic

The roadside vendors owing allegiance to the Allipuram Mahatma Gandhi Market Chiru Vyaparasthula Sangam affiliated to the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) staged a demonstration at the Mahatma Gandhi statue near the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) administrative building on Thursday, demanding cancellation of the collection of daily cess from them.

Sangam district president S.K. Rehaman and CPI leader Kasireddy Satyanarayana said that hundreds of petty vendors and their family members have been doing business at the market for the past 80 years.

They said the GVMC had collected money in the form of demand drafts from the vendors for establishment of permanent shops for them.

It was agreed upon at that time that no taxes would be paid by the vendors for the rest of their lives, they pointed out.

In violation of that agreement, a proposal was made by the municipal corporation to collect taxes from the vendors, said the Sangam leaders.

382,2020/10/09,FDNA opposes move to privatise MR College,"Representatives write letter to Minister seeking intervention of the govt.

The Forum for Development of North Andhra (FDNA) has appealed to the Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Botcha Satyanarayana not to allow the proposed privatisation of the Maharaja College (MR College) in Vizianagaram.

In a letter to the Minister, who is an alumnus of the institution, on Thursday, FDNA general secretary A. Aja Sarma and organising secretary M.S. Vasa expressed concern over the media reports that the MANSAS Trust was planning to privatise the college.

Set up as a school in 1857, the institution was upgraded into a high school in 1868 and subsequently into a college in 1879. New buildings were constructed for the college with the UGC funds recently, they said.

Referring to the decision reportedly taken by the MANSAS Trust to privatise the MR College, they said the State government cannot just wash its hands of the issue on the plea that it is up to the Trust to take a decision. “The government had initiated action against the Prema Samajam Trust in Visakhapatnam recently for the alleged irregularities by the trust,” pointed out Mr. Aja Sarma.

‘Not individual property’

There are 12 educational institutions under the purview of the MANSAS Trust. “The assets of the trust are not the personal property of an individual. The trust was established to protect land. Had it not been established, the government would have acquired the land long ago. The protection of land is, therefore, the responsibility of the trust. If the trust tries to dispose of the land, the government should intervene,” argued the FDNA representatives.

They noted that legendary writers such as Gidugu Rammurthy and Gurajada Appa Rao, former Chief Justice of AP High Court P. Satyanarayana Raju and former Judges of AP High Court K. Punnaiah and G. Ramanujulu Naidu are all the alumni of MR College.

“You (the Minister) are also an alumnus of this college. It is wrong to privatise the institution. The trust chairperson is believed to have said that the decision to privatise the college was taken by the previous government. A mistake is a mistake, irrespective of who does it,” said Mr. Aja Sarma.

The FDNA leaders sought the intervention of the Minister and wanted that the facts pertaining to the issue be made public. They felt that, if necessary, the government should take over the college and run it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/fdna-opposes-move-to-privatise-mr-college/article32807767.ece

The beneficiaries include 49,695 students in Araku mandal, 43,717 in Paderu mandal and 37,750 in Bheemili mandal, apart from 29,665 students in four Assembly constituencies in the city.

Pendurthy MLA Adeep Raju, along with District Eduction Officer (DEO) B. Lingeswara Reddy, the officials of Sarva Sikhha Abhiyan (SSA) took part in the launch at a government school at Saripalle. Political representatives of the YSRCP launched the programme in their respective constituencies and distributed the kits.

Students,along with their parents, received the kits. The schools have allotted slots for about 25 to 50 students in two sessions based on the strength .

K. Vani, a parent who collected the kit at GVMC school at Madhura Nagar said the quality of uniforms, shoes, books are good. “These kits shall help us a lot as we are financially affected by the pandemic. We always had the feeling that our children miss the environment of corporate schools. Now, I am sure, the government school students will not feel it again,” she said.

It is a short story collection that is quietly enthralling,deeply moving and strangely bewildering, all at the same time. The stories abandon even the slightest pretence of a plot or narrative, and are fresh and untouched in their beauty and appeal. Deceptively simple in their crafting and devoid of all embellishments, they focus on the minutiae of life, making even the most commonplace of events arresting.

Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke

(Translated by Stephen Mitchell)

It is a book I find myself going back to whenever I feel stuck. Replete with the invaluable wisdom on life and writing that Rilke bequeathed on a young military cadet and budding poet Franz Xaver Kappus through a series of stirringly profound letters, this jewel of a volume has practical advice that is no less than poetry. The letters touch upon things such as why must one write and what books do to our inner lives, how does one savour solitude, the value of living with uncertainty, and the nature of advice itself.

An intimate portrait of loneliness, painted with a lot of empathy and humanity.

This is a Poem that Heals Fish by Jean-Pierre Simeón

(Illustrated by Olivier Tallec, translated from the French by Claudia Zoe Bedrick)

Picture books is what I turn to for a sense of comfort and security. There is something about reading and re-reading these wonderful stories that carry the most profound philosophies, distilled in the most unselfconscious language. These last few months I kept returning to this beautiful picture book about a little boy who worries that his pet fish may die of boredom and his mother suggests that he give the fish a poem. The boy has no idea what a poem is and so begins a story of what all a poem can be. The text is poetic and playful and the illustrations are tender, warm and vibrantly expressive.

The Lonely City: Adventures in the Art of Being Alone by Olivia Laing

Easily one of the best works I have read recently. Part memoir, part art history, part criticism, part biography...a neat description of this book is difficult to pull off. What it does though, with great subtlety and sensitivity, is to invite a deep meditation on loneliness. Laing deftly examines the connection between loneliness and creativity through the works of four great artists — Edward Hopper, Andy Warhol, David Wojnarowicz and Henry Darger, drawing parallels between them and their characters, while also reflecting on her own experiences of loneliness.

388,2020/10/09,World Mental Health Day: Influencers share how content creation impacts their mental health,"Being online 24/7 is exhausting. Digital creators are increasingly using their reach to talk about mental health issues and the jadedness that comes with being an influencer

Just a few weeks ago, when Ankush Bahuguna hit 4,00,000 followers, he expected it to be a happy day. After all, he had worked hard to achieve this milestone. Instead, he spent the day being anxious. He later posted on his Instagram handle saying, “I’ve not been in a great mental space since the last few weeks. It feels like I’m in a never ending race. The faster you run to the finish line, the further it gets. Lately, it is bothering me that I am unable to celebrate small wins like these.”

The Delhi-based influencer, popular for his short funny videos and for creating characters like DIY Babita and Pankaj, says, “If your daily mood starts depending on the number of likes and views on your posts, that is when you realise something is not right. When I decided to become an influencer I had 10,000 followers and my aim was to reach 1,00,000. But now that I have three times that, I am not happy. My day depends on how many people are talking about my post. The constant need for validation is not healthy.”

As the business of influencing is getting more serious with bigger platforms like Netflix and Amazon turning to them for content, several influencers are talking about mental health issues due to the growing scrutiny and criticism that come along with the popularity. Over the past few years, several big names from the industry, including Lilly Singh and PewDiePie, have announced a hiatus from social media citing burnout issues due to their content creating schedules.

“It is just an app, but my life and my career depend on it. It is a heartbreaking thing to say aloud but that is the reality,” says Dolly Singh. The content creator — who has a following of one million people on Instagram — says she does go offline when things get overwhelming, then adds, “but I can barely stay away from the app for 24 to 48 hours because, after all, it is my livelihood and there is a fear of losing followers and declining engagement.” One of the most difficult things about being an influencer for Dolly is the constant need for validation every single day. “I have to post something daily and my success relies on the number of comments and likes for that particular post. That kind of puts you in a vulnerable state,” she says.

Nevertheless, she has a passion for her work, which she says helped her sail through the pandemic. The new circumstances to which the world was adjusting meant newer topics to talk about on her Instagram. “I was busy making content about being locked up and the trends that were happening over social media,” she says. But the same lockdown that gave her fodder for her work, eventually eroded her mental health too. “By the end of July I started feeling like I needed a break,” she says.

A universal challenge all influencers now deal with is online harassment and trolling. Ankush says, “I recently started putting up makeup videos and how it is important to normalise men wearing foundation or flaunting a winged eyeliner. Though I was appreciated for that, many people commented saying I was spoiling the generation and I should look for better things to do. Usually, I ignore such comments but on days when you are already feeling low, hate comments hit harder no matter how thick your skin is. Constructive criticism is welcome, trolling is not.”

A bit more real

Realising the responsibility on their part as content creators, Dolly and Ankush have been avoiding the façade of perfectly-curated Instagram feeds. “I do not want my followers to think that my life is all fun and games. If they want to like me they have to like the real me,” says Ankush. Dolly believes in using her reach to normalise mental health issues. “I was bullied as a child and I had mental health issues even then but I was unaware that it is normal. If only I was informed, I wouldn’t have spent my childhood feeling weird about myself,” she adds.

A psychologist’s notes Psychologist Deepa Mohan, who heads the psychology department at GITAM University in Visakhapatnam, says, “It is okay to feel bad and de-motivated. We are in troubled times, so allow yourself the liberty to slow down and deal with things at your own pace.” Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram can be used to inform yourself about your surroundings but when used excessively, can hamper mental health. “There is nothing wrong in going back and checking the number of likes or comments on your picture, it is human nature to be drawn towards appreciation; but the problem begins when you get obsessed with it and start questioning your self-worth based on those likes. A healthier life offline, that includes making time for your hobbies or spending time with your loved ones can help in betterment of mental health,” she adds.

Michael Ajay, a 25-year-old fitness blogger with over 50,000 followers on Instagram, talks about how he battled depression, after he had an accident three years ago and was bed ridden. “Body training helped me recover and also shed 25 kilograms that I had put on. When the lockdown started, my work as a freelance physical trainer got affected and I started having dark thoughts. I was scared that the depression would relapse. My sleep cycle was disturbed and I lacked motivation to do anything,” he says.

He got over this slump the only way he knew how: by working out. “I made a routine and tried my best to follow it. I also started posting my workout videos on Instagram and a lot of people appreciated that. It helped me get through the day,” says Michael.

However, despite the external motivation his blogging provided, he decided to stay away from social media for a few days as it affected his mental health. “I kept seeing happier pictures of me posted in the past. Also, so many people were posting about the fun things they were doing during the lockdown, and I kept questioning why I was having a bad time while everyone else was okay.” He adds, “It took me a while to make myself understand that my pace of dealing with things is different and it is alright to have issues. I started using Instagram only to share my content and not consume it, and that eventually helped.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/ns7t17/article32811800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/internetharrassment-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/how-content-creation-is-impacting-influencers/article32811801.ece
