1,2020/10/14,Indian women face daunting task: Deepika,"‘Just one tournament left to qualify for Tokyo Games and two spots to earn’

Commonwealth Games gold medallist and former World No. 1 Deepika Kumari feels Indian women archers face a daunting task of securing the full quota for next year’s Olympics owing to the cancellation of planned tournaments in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Indians have just one tournament left to qualify for Tokyo and two spots to earn.

Talking on Indian paddler Mudit Dani’s online chat show In The Sportlight, Deepika said that the country’s female archers had worked hard and were confident of securing the quota ahead of the COVID-19 lockdown.

“We were completely blanked as qualifiers were in a month’s time when the lockdown happened, our practice was going really well but then suddenly we had no idea what to do,” she said.

“Right now, we only have one quota spot in the women’s category and only one qualifier is left to secure the two other quota places. Normally we always secure a full quota by this period, but it is different this time around.”

After failing to secure the team quota at the World Championships in June last year, the Indian women’s archery team will have its last shot to secure the full Olympics quota in Paris, as a separate tournament is planned ahead of the World Cup in June next year.

Deepika, who’s currently the country’s only woman archer to have secured a spot at the Tokyo Games, also recalled that despite being a two-time Olympian, she has never been part of an Olympics opening ceremony.

“In archery our ranking begins on the same day as the opening ceremony. So we feel sad that I have never been to any opening ceremony and have only watched it on TV,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/k1jzjf/article32856105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15DEEPIKA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/indian-women-face-daunting-task-deepika/article32856106.ece
2,2020/10/14,Koepka returns from two-month injury absence,"‘It’s just all about trying to make sure everything’s good’

Brooks Koepka, injury troubles “squared away” is back — again — and hoping some good golf will see him end a disrupted 2020 on a high note.

“I’ve got my body squared away, feels a lot better,” Koepka said on Tuesday as he prepared to make his first start in almost two months at the US PGA Tour CJ Cup at Shadow Creek.

Koepka, who started the year ranked No. 1 in the world but was bumped out of the top-10 this week, has been sidelined since withdrawing from the Northern Trust, in August.

The two-time US Open champion missed the Coronavirus-postponed championship as he continued to recover from a hip injury that he says was related to earlier knee trouble.

It was at the CJ Cup in South Korea last year that Koepka slipped on some wet concrete and aggravated a prior left knee injury.

He was sidelined for three months, and played just two months before the pandemic brought the world to a halt.

In 13 starts worldwide this year, the four-time Major winner has two top-10 finishes, including a tie for second at the WGC event in Memphis.

He was in contention at the PGA Championship in San Francisco, but fired a final-round 74. After missing the cut at the Wyndham Championship, he called a halt to focus on treating and rehabbing his hip.

“I really had no idea how bad I felt through the whole year,” Koepka said.

Koepka said he received another round of platelet-rich plasma treatment on his knee about three weeks ago. He also had a painkilling injection in his hip, but was told that rest would be the real key. ”It’s just all about trying to make sure everything’s good. I’m just doing rehab every day and just trying to get better.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/p20s1k/article32856038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15KOEPKA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/koepka-returns-from-two-month-injury-absence/article32856039.ece
3,2020/10/14,DeChambeau wants to be fresh for Masters,"Decides to take a break before teeing off at Augusta on Nov. 12

Bryson DeChambeau has taken some unusual routes in his career, from his single-length clubs to bulking up in an effort to swing as hard as he can.

Add to the list his decision to take a month off without competition leading to the Masters.

The Shriners Hospitals for Children Open last week, where DeChambeau was tied for eighth, is his only tournament between winning the U.S. Open on Sept. 20 and playing the first round of the Masters on Nov. 12.

So much for trying to use tournaments to peak for the Majors.

DeChambeau figures he has gone down this road before. He mentioned the three months golf was shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

When he returned at Colonial, he was bigger and stronger and his club speed was faster. He missed a playoff by one shot. He followed with a pair of top 10s. And then he won the Rocket Mortgage Classic.

“As I look back at quarantine... I felt like I came back really well not playing any golf, not doing anything,” DeChambeau said.

“I feel like my game is good enough right now to do that. I don’t feel like there is going to be a problem coming back. We’ll see how it works out for me. I have no idea, but I feel comfortable. And that’s all that matters for me right now. In his world, not doing anything is not playing tournaments. There is always work.”

DeChambeau left Winged Foot with the U.S. Open trophy and headed straight to Denver to start working out. Upon leaving Las Vegas, he plans to be in Dallas practicing every day, working out every day and doing a lot of speed training.

“Every other day I’ll do a speed training session trying to get my swing speed, at least with a 48-inch driver, up to 200 (mph) on average,” he said.

The 48-inch driver, used primarily in long driving competitions, is what he hopes to bring to Augusta National, where he expects to play all the long holes (except No. 10) differently than they’ve ever been played.

Scouting trip

DeChambeau said he would take one scouting trip to Augusta National ahead of the first Masters ever held in November. He mentioned he would go with a good friend — presumably not Brooks Koepka — and have some fun and see what I can do.

“I’ve still got some equipment stuff coming in the next two months. That’s mainly why I’m taking it off,” he said, declining to elaborate.

“I feel like the advantages that I usually have could be much improved upon with the equipment, and we don’t have it yet. But we’re diligently working on it behind the scenes.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/tyjl7a/article32855988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15DECHAMBEU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/dechambeau-wants-to-be-fresh-for-masters/article32855989.ece
4,2020/10/14,A wearable that can track facial expressions while wearing masks,"The technology, C-Face, uses two tiny cameras and deep learning algorithm to continuously observe facial contours and reconstruct expressions.

Researchers at Cornell University have developed an ear-mounted wearable sensing technology that can track facial expressions, even when someone is wearing a face mask.

The technology, C-Face, uses two tiny cameras and deep learning algorithm to continuously observe facial contours and reconstruct expressions. The researchers have used this technology in prototype devices like earphones and headphones.

Also read | Facial recognition algorithms are unable to recognise faces

“Earlier, wearable technology was aiming to recognise facial expressions, most solutions needed to attach sensors on the face,” said Cheng Zhang, Director of Cornell’s SciFi Lab in a Cornell release. “And even with so much instrumentation, they could only recognise a limited set of discrete facial expressions.”

“Because it works by detecting muscle movement, C-Face can capture expressions even when users are wearing masks,” Zhang explained.

The prototype devices are embedded with the RGB cameras, which are located below each ear to capture the facial muscle movements. Then using computer vision and a deep learning model the captured images are reconstructed.

During the process, the model simplifies the images of cheeks into 42 facial feature points, depicting the shapes and positions of the mouth, eyes and eyebrows as they are most affected by changes in expression, the Cornell release noted.

According to the researchers, the technology could be used as a communication tool in virtual reality (VR), to translate expressions into emojis, or for silent speech commands.

Last week, Jack Dorsey's payments company Square invested $50 million in Bitcoin. It purchased 4,709 bitcoins at an average price of $10,617 per Bitcoin, it said in an official statement.

Square’s investment represents one percent of its total assets as of at the end of second quarter of 2020.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer virtual currency that uses blockchain technology to facilitate instant payments. Founded in 2008, the cryptocurrency is open-source with a public design, allowing everyone to participate.

It is the world's largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation and trading volume, according to cryptoassets tracking website CoinMarketCap.

Square’s Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja expects Bitcoin to have ""the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future.""

""For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey,"" she added.

This isn't the first time Square showed interest in cryptocurrency. The San Francisco-based company launched Cash App, a Bitcoin trading app in 2018 that enables buying and selling of the cryptoasset. In 2019, the company formed Square Crypto, an independent team focused on contributing to Bitcoin open-source work.

Facebook is rolling out a new logo, chat themes, selfie stickers and vanish mode for its Messenger.

The California-based company said the new look reflects a shift to the future of messaging. The new update is part of Facebook’s measures to integrate Messenger with Instagram’s direct messages.

“Today, Messenger gets a new look to mark our continued evolution from a simple way to message your Facebook friends, to a place to hang out with your favorite people, on your favorite apps and devices,” Stan Chudnovsky, VP of Messenger said in a blog post.

Facebook Messenger has moved away from its traditional solid blue colour logo to a new blue-to-pink gradient logo which is similar to the colour scheme of Instagram’s logo.

Apart from the new logo, users can choose new chat themes like love and tie-dye, and custom reactions. They can also customise selfie stickers with their own pictures.

In addition to this, Facebook’s will be rolling out a vanish mode feature where messages will disappear once a user leaves the chat or after the message is viewed.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Scientists at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Institute for Astronomy (IfA) produced the world’s largest 3D astronomical imaging catalog of stars, galaxies and quasars using Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The team of astronomers used world’s largest deep multi-coloured optical survey, produced by the Pan-STARRS observatory at Haleakalā, Maui, to develop the map.

They fed the algorithm spectroscopic measurements to accurately determine definite object classifications and distances between celestial objects.

The study found that the AI or Machine Learning (ML) approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.1% for galaxies, 97.8% for stars and 96.6% for quasars. And galaxy distance estimates were accurate to almost 3%.

Utilizing a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm, the team leveraged the spectroscopic training set of almost 4 million light sources to teach the neural network to predict source types and galaxy distances, while correcting for light extinction by dust in the Milky Way.

The team said their catalog is double the size of the previous largest map of the universe, created by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which covers only a third of the sky.

“The new, more accurate, and larger photometric redshift catalog will be the starting point for many future discoveries,” István Szapudi, IfA astronomer and co-author on the study said.

“As Pan-STARRS collects more and more data, we will use machine learning to extract even more information about near-Earth objects, our Solar System, our Galaxy and our Universe,” Ken Chambers, Pan-STARRS Director and IfA Associate Astronomer said.

The resulting 3D catalog is approximately 300 GB in size, and science users can query the catalog through the MAST CasJobs SQL interface, or download the entire collection as a computer-readable table.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/h3omym/article32851735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/largest-3d-map-picturejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ai-helps-make-worlds-largest-3d-map-of-the-universe/article32851688.ece
8,2020/10/14,India joins UK in drive against encrypted social media messages,"The UK and India are joined by the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan in a joint international statement addressed to all tech companies to ensure they do not blind themselves to illegal activity on their platforms, including child abuse images.

India is among seven countries to back a UK-led campaign against end-to-end encryption of messages by social media giants such as Facebook, which they say hinder law enforcement by blocking all access to them.

The UK and India are joined by the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan in a joint international statement addressed to all tech companies to ensure they do not blind themselves to illegal activity on their platforms, including child abuse images.

It marks an expansion of the so-called “Five Eyes” group of nations, a global alliance on intelligence issues, to include India and Japan.

We owe it to all of our citizens, especially our children, to ensure their safety by continuing to unmask sexual predators and terrorists operating online, said UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, in reference to the statement issued on Sunday.

It is essential that tech companies do not turn a blind eye to this problem and hamper their, as well as law enforcement’s, ability to tackle these sickening criminal acts. Our countries urge all tech companies to work with us to find a solution that puts the public’s safety first, she said.

While directed at all tech firms, the statement does make a reference to the fact that the populations of the seven signatory countries represent a fifth of Facebook’s users across the world and claimed that end-to-end encryption policies such as those employed by the social media giant erode the public’s safety online.

The seven signatories of the international statement have made it clear that when end-to-end encryption is applied with no access to content, it severely undermines the ability of companies to take action against illegal activity on their own platforms, it notes.

It also prevents law enforcement investigating and prosecuting the most serious crimes being committed on these services such as online child sexual abuse, grooming and terrorist content, it said.

The statement calls on tech companies to ensure there is no reduction in user safety when designing their encrypted services; to enable law enforcement access to content where it is necessary and proportionate; and work with governments to facilitate this.

The UK and its international partners are clear that they support strong encryption, but not where it is applied in a way that precludes all legal access to content, therefore putting the public at significant risk of harm, the statement notes.

In response, Facebook said it had long argued that end-to-end encryption is necessary to protect people’s most private information.

“In all of these countries, people prefer end-to-end encrypted messaging on various apps because it keeps their messages safe from hackers, criminals, and foreign interference,” a Facebook spokesperson said.

Facebook has led the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect, and respond to abuse while maintaining high security and we will continue to do so, the spokesperson said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/7e6zt8/article32851267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/encryption-tooljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/india-joins-uk-in-drive-against-encrypted-social-media-messages/article32851224.ece

Researchers at New York University (NYU) have identified how cultural stereotypes found their way into artificial intelligence (AI) models in the early years of their development.

The team’s findings help understand the factors that influence a search engine’s result page and other AI-powered tools, including translation systems, personal assistants, and resume screening software.

In recent years, advances in applied language understanding technology have primarily been driven by the use of language representation models that are trained by exposing them to huge amounts of internet text.

These models not only learn about the language during the training process, they also learn from it by picking up ideas on how the world works from what people write about. This makes for systems that perform well on typical AI benchmarks, but it also causes problems, NYU said in a study titled ‘Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing’.

Models acquire social biases that are reflected in the data. This can be dangerous when the models are used for decision making, especially when they’re asked to make a decision about some piece of text that describes people of colour, or any other social group that faces widespread stereotyping.

In order to mitigate the occurrences of social biases in AI-powered models, a team of writers were asked to note down sentences that express a stereotypical view of a specified social group, as well as incongruous 'anti-stereotypical' sentences that expressed the same view about a different social group.

Using sentence pairs, they then created a metric to measure bias in three widely used language representation models, and deployed that metric to show that each of the three masked language models (MLMs) readily recognized stereotyped sentences as more typical than the anti-stereotyped sentences, demonstrating their knowledge and use of the stereotypes.

The state-of-the-art model among the three, the one that does best on typical applied benchmarks, also demonstrated the most extensive use of stereotypes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/ky1jxx/article32850907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/facial-bias-reutersjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/how-bias-crept-into-ai-technologies/article32850911.ece

12,2020/10/14,Robert Destro appointed U.S. special envoy to Tibet,"The position has been lying vacant since January 20, 2017

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the concurrent designation of Assistant Secretary Robert A. Destro of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to serve as the country’s Coordinator for Tibetan Issues.

The appointment of Mr. Destro to the position — established by the U.S.’s Tibetan Policy Act (2002) — was announced by Mr. Pompeo at a press briefing in Washington on Wednesday.

The position has been vacant since January 20, 2017 and lawmakers as well as the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) had urged the Trump administration to fill the position. The coordinator is, by law, assigned to promote “substantive dialogue” between the government of China and the Dalai Lama, coordinate U.S. policy and projects on Tibet and help promote policies that protect the distinct identity of Tibet and safeguard human rights in the region.

“The United States remains concerned with the PRC’s [People’s Republic of China] repression of the Tibetan community, including the lack of meaningful autonomy, the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas, and severe restrictions on Tibetans’ religious freedom and cultural traditions within China,” a statement from Mr. Pompeo said.

“Special Coordinator Destro will engage Tibetan leaders and international partners and experts to address these issues. He also will carry forward the Department’s engagement with and support for Tibet’s global diaspora and their many courageous advocates for the protection of human rights, including the freedom of religion or belief,” he said.

Consistent with his obligations under the TPA, Mr. Destro will “lead U.S. efforts to promote dialogue between the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Dalai Lama or his representatives; protect the unique religious, cultural, and linguistic identity of Tibetans; and press for their human rights to be respected”, Mr. Pompeo said.

“He also will support U.S. efforts to address the humanitarian needs of Tibetan refugees and to promote sustainable economic development and environmental conservation in Tibetan communities on the plateau,” the statement said.

13,2020/10/14,"On reforms anniversary, Xi outlines innovation push","President warns of ‘unprecedented’ global challenges.

China on Wednesday marked the 40th anniversary of the establishment of its first special economic zone (SEZ) in Shenzhen, outlining plans to boost its innovation capabilities and global technological influence, even as it grapples with a bruising trade and technology war with the U.S.

President Xi Jinping, who travelled to Shenzhen and Guangdong province to mark the anniversary — a key step on China’s economic reforms and opening up process — in a close to hour-long speech warned of “unprecedented” global challenges and a “turbulent” world facing China, but did not mention relations with the U.S. specifically.

Mr. Xi’s visit to Guangdong province for the anniversary had been billed as a key political event in China for 2020, coinciding with the Communist Party’s plans to mark the year as when it would eliminate extreme poverty and build what it calls a “moderately prosperous society”. This will be followed by another major anniversary next year, when the Communist Party of China turns 100.

The planned events had been overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which did not, however, derail Mr. Xi’s visit, with China now broadly tackling the spread of the outbreak at home for now.

New engines

“We need to unswervingly implement an innovation-driven development strategy to foster new engines and new trends, so as to build a technological and industrial innovation high-ground with global influence,” Mr. Xi said in a speech to a hall packed with mask-wearing dignitaries, describing Shenzhen’s SEZ and the reforms that propelled China’s economy to become the world’s second-largest as “a miracle in the world development history”.

Since the setting up of the SEZ in 1980, Shenzhen’s GDP had grown 20% annually, he said, to $400 billion. The GDP of Shenzhen, which is a key tech hub for China and home to some of its corporate giants such as Huawei and Tencent, surpassed Hong Kong’s in 2018.

Mr. Xi also outlined plans to take forward the integration of Guangdong province with Hong Kong and Macau as part of the Greater Bay Area plan, which looks to leverage Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre.

The push towards integration with the mainland has been backed by Hong Kong’s business houses but also viewed warily by some in the Special Administrative Region, who are concerned both by the city's waning influence and the dilution of the “one country, two systems” model.

Mr. Xi did not mention the unrest in Hong Kong and last year’s mass protests, but called for “efforts to synergise economic rules and mechanisms in the three regions and urging wider exchanges and deeper integration among young people in those regions to strengthen their sense of belonging to the motherland.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qt456h/article32856647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THRDXI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/on-reforms-anniversary-xi-outlines-innovation-push/article32856648.ece
14,2020/10/14,"Donald Trump, Joe Biden to hold rival TV town halls","They will be simultaneously, but separately, talking to voters in TV studios — NBC for Mr. Trump and ABC for Mr. Biden.

President Donald Trump will feature in a televised town hall on Thursday on NBC News, the network said, setting up a direct scheduling clash with rival Joe Biden who had already planned his own version.

The two were originally meant to have been meeting for their second debate on Thursday evening. Instead, they will be simultaneously, but separately, talking to voters in TV studios — NBC for Mr. Trump and ABC for Mr. Biden.

Mr. Trump will be in Miami, the network said, while Mr. Biden, who had already booked his appearance last week, will be in Philadelphia. Their scheduled debate had also been designed as a town hall where the two candidates would have fielded questions from voters, but this was upended after Mr. Trump contracted the coronavirus.

Debate organisers said they wanted to switch the format to a virtual appearance, for safety reasons, and Mr. Trump refused, forcing cancellation of the event.

NBC News said on Wednesday it had received a statement from the clinical director at the National Institutes of Health and lead infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci that they had “a high degree of confidence” that Mr. Trump is now “not shedding infectious virus.” Mr. Trump and the NBC host will be socially distanced and the audience will wear masks.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned China that its “coercive diplomacy,” repressive measures in Hong Kong and detention of Uighur Muslims are counterproductive for itself and the rest of the world.

Mr. Trudeau took aim at Beijing’s record as he marked the 50th anniversary of Canada establishing diplomatic ties with China.

“We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China’s approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens alongside other citizens of other countries around the world is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,” he said on Tuesday.

He also noted Canada’s “concern for the protection of human rights and places like Hong Kong and... with the Uighurs.” Canada will work with “like-minded nations around the world, to impress upon China that its approach to internal affairs and global affairs is not on a particularly productive path for itself or for all of us”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/h5viz6/article32340841.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKHEALTH-CORONAVIRUSLEADERSFACTBOX,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/justin-trudeau-takes-aim-at-china-on-human-rights/article32856539.ece

17,2020/10/14,Azerbaijan targets Armenia as Karabakh fighting widens,"Missile launchers destroyed, Armenia warns it will retaliate.

Azerbaijan said on Wednesday it had destroyed missile launchers inside Armenia that were targetting its cities, as fierce fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh risked widening beyond the disputed region.

Hundreds have already lost their lives in two weeks of fighting, and continued clashes have rendered almost meaningless a humanitarian ceasefire agreed in Moscow last week. Armenia confirmed that military positions inside the country had been hit but denied its forces had been firing into Azerbaijan. It warned that it too could start targeting military sites inside its adversary’s territory.

Clashes over Nagorno-Karabakh — where Armenia-backed separatist fighters are battling Azerbaijani forces — have been largely confined to areas in and around the region since a fresh outbreak of fighting started last month. Direct confrontations between Armenia and Azerbaijan risk spiralling into an all-out, multi-front war with devastating consequences for both sides.

Moscow has so far refused to become drawn into the conflict — even though Armenia is part of a regional Russia-led security group — noting that the organisation’s treaty does not apply to Karabakh.

Azerbaijan’s Defence Ministry said in statements Wednesday that it had destroyed ballistic missile launchers deployed in Armenia in two separate attacks overnight. Launchers at the first site were aiming at the Azerbaijani cities of Ganja, Mingachevir and other populated areas, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ejix7l/article32856468.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THRDAZERBAIJAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/azerbaijan-targets-armenia-as-karabakh-fighting-widens/article32856469.ece
18,2020/10/14,"World Bank approves $12B to finance virus vaccines, care","The World Bank said its COVID-19 emergency response programmes are already reaching 111 countries.

The World Bank has approved $12 billion in financing to help developing countries buy and distribute coronavirus vaccines, tests, and treatments, aiming to support the vaccination of up to one billion people.

The $12 billion envelop is part of a wider World Bank Group package of up to $160 billion to help developing countries fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the bank said in a statement late Tuesday.

The World Bank said its COVID-19 emergency response programmes are already reaching 111 countries.

Citizens in developing countries also need access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, it said.

We are extending and expanding our fast-track approach to address the COVID emergency so that developing countries have fair and equal access to vaccines, said the bank’s president, David Malpass, said in the statement.

Access to safe and effective vaccines and strengthened delivery systems is key to alter the course of the pandemic and help countries experiencing catastrophic economic and fiscal impacts move toward a resilient recovery, he said.

The International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank is investing in vaccine manufacturers through a $4 billion Global Health Platform, the statement said.

Development and deployment of vaccines is crucial to helping stem outbreaks of the coronavirus that has killed more than 1 million people and sickened more than 38 million, while devastating economies and leaving many millions jobless.

The World Bank said it will draw on expertise and experience from its involvement in many large-scale immunization programs and other public health efforts.

19,2020/10/14,Pakistan re-elected to United Nations Human Rights Council,"With its re-election, Pakistan will continue as a member for another three-year term commencing on January 1, 2021.

Pakistan has been re-elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council despite opposition from activist groups over its abysmal human rights records.

Among the five candidates from the Asia-Pacific region vying for four seats in the UN’s premiere human rights body, Pakistan secured the highest number of votes, the Foreign Office said.

In a secret-ballot voting in the 193-member UN General Assembly on that race, Pakistan secured 169 votes, Uzbekistan received 164, Nepal 150, China 139 and Saudi Arabia lost the race with just 90 votes.

Under the Human Rights Council’s rules, seats are allocated to regions to ensure geographical representation. Except for the Asia-Pacific contest, the election of 15 members to the 47-member Human Rights Council was all but decided in advance because all the other regional groups had uncontested slates.

Last week, a coalition of human rights groups from Europe, the US and Canada called on UN member states to oppose the election of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, saying their human rights records make them unqualified.

Russia and Cuba, running unopposed, also won the seats.

Pakistan is currently serving on the HRC since January 1, 2018. With its re-election, Pakistan will continue as a member for another three-year term commencing on January 1, 2021.

Since the HRC’s establishment in 2006, this is the fifth time that Pakistan has been elected to the United Nations’ premier body on human rights.

The Foreign Office said that “international community once again reposed confidence in Pakistan, recognising its contribution to the national and global human rights agenda and strong credentials as a consensus builder in the council.”

“Pakistan remains firmly committed to upholding, promoting and safeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and will sustain its efforts towards ensuring that the HRC’s work is guided by the principles of universality, impartiality, dialogue and cooperation,” it said.

20,2020/10/14,Korean boy band BTS faces uproar in China over war comments,"The leader of the band, who goes by the name RM, thanked Korean War veterans for their sacrifices.

Chinese nationalists erupted in anger at South Korean boy band BTS after its leader thanked Korean War veterans for their sacrifices.

The singer, who goes by RM, made the remark in a recorded acceptance speech for an award from the Korea Society for promoting U.S.-Korean relations.

“We will always remember the history of pain that our two nations shared together and the sacrifices of countless men and women,” RM said in the speech, which included no mention of China.

“After 70 years, the world we are living in is much closer than before. Boundaries in many aspects are getting more blurred,” RM said. “As members of the global community, we should build a deeper understanding and solidarity to be happier together.”

Chinese internet users and state media took RM’s comments as a slap at China, whose soldiers fought alongside North Korean forces during their failed attempt to annex South Korea in the 1950-53 war.

They accused RM of ignoring the role played by China in the war, which Chinese Communist Party propaganda blames on the United States, instead of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung’s attack on South Korea.

“Before, I thought some BTS songs were pretty good. Now, they seem to be covered in excrement,” said a commenter on the microblog service Sina Weibo.

An account titled BTS Insults China had been viewed more than 4.5 million times, according to Sina Weibo.

Many Chinese netizens pointed out that the speech plays up to U.S. netizens, but the country played the role of aggressor in the war, said an article in the Global Times newspaper, controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.

The attacks reflect Beijing’s assertiveness abroad and enduring Chinese sensitivity about the Korean Peninsula.

Asked about the controversy, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said, “What I want to say is that it should be our common pursuit to take history as a mirror, face the future, cherish peace and promote friendship.”

State-controlled media

The ruling party uses the entirely state-controlled media to whip up anger against foreign companies, celebrities or governments that take steps Beijing dislikes.

Last year, Chinese state TV suspended broadcasts of National Basketball Association games after the general manager of the Houston Rockets expressed support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. Broadcasts resumed this week.

In 2017, Beijing destroyed South Korean retailer Lotte’s business in China after the company sold land to South Korea’s government to install an anti-missile system opposed by Chinese leaders.

Since the Korean War, Beijing has helped prop up isolated North Korea with gifts of oil and other aid to maintain a buffer between China and U.S.-allied South Korea.

Online Chinese fan groups demanded an apology from BTS and called for boycotts of an upcoming album and promotional events.

BTS-related products were missing this week from the online stores of Samsung Electronics and sports brand FILA on Chinese e-commerce websites including Alibaba Group’s TMall and JD.com.

Global brands have tried to distance themselves from politically touchy issues, especially Taiwan, the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing as part of its territory, and Hong Kong, the scene of pro-democracy protests.

In 2016, Hong Kong singer Denise Ho said cosmetics giant Lancome canceled a concert to distance itself from her pro-democracy activism.

The same year, Taiwan-born Korean pop singer Chou Tzu-yu apologized for shaking a Taiwanese flag on South Korean TV after criticism by China.

BTS has yet to respond, but South Korean fans reacted angrily.

“BTS fans are from all over the world, so China’s bullying will be known to all countries that took part in the Korean War,” said Johnny Kim, a South Korean engineer.

The row comes ahead of Thursday’s stock market debut of BTS’s management company, Big Hit Entertainment.

Hong Kong’s most prominent dissident, Joshua Wong, weighed in, criticizing Beijing for provoking groundless rage and division.

“There are still many Korean War veterans around the world, including those from the United States, so it’s not reasonable for China to pick a fight over this,” said Min-seong Lee, a student in Seoul.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9hc7xl/article32850783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOUTHKOREACHINABTSKOREANWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/korean-boy-band-bts-faces-uproar-in-china-over-war-comments/article32850784.ece

Tanzanian authorities say 500 volunteers have been trying to put out a fire on Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s tallest peak. The flames can be seen from miles away.

A Tanzania National Parks’statement said Tuesday that the volunteers have managed to limit the fire’s spread. Spokesman Pascal Shelutete said the area still burning is known as Kifunika Hill.

He said the cause of the fire has yet to be established. Allan Kijazi, head of Tanzania National Parks, said the fire has consumed 28 square kilometers of vegetation.

Officials assured tourists tourists of their safety. The mountain is popular with hikers and climbers.

22,2020/10/14,Cyprus cancels maligned ‘golden passport’ scheme,"The move comes after allegations of money laundering and other abuse of its provisions

Cyprus on Tuesday scrapped a lucrative programme granting citizenship to wealthy investors amid new allegations that a top state official and a veteran lawmaker were implicated in attempts to bypass strict vetting rules and issue a passport to a fictitious investor with a supposed criminal record.

Cyprus government spokesman Kyriakos Koushos said the Cabinet accepted a recommendation by the Minsters of the Interior and Finance to cancel altogether the golden passport program that has netted billions of euros over several years.

Mr. Koushos said the decision, which goes into effect Nov. 1, was based on the Cyprus Investment Program’s long-standing weaknesses, but also the abuse of its provisions.

He said the government would in due course look at different ways of attracting foreign investment.

The allegations surfaced in an hour-long undercover report by Al Jazeera’s investigative unit that used hidden cameras to show Parliamentary Speaker Demetris Syllouris and lawmaker Christakis Giovanis pledging full support to granting a passport to a fictitious Chinese investor, despite a money laundering conviction against him.

The report also showed lawyer Andreas Pittadjis, real estate agents and others outlining to a man posing as a representative for the Chinese investor different ways to skirt background checks, including a name change or granting citizenship through his wife.

Both Pittadjis and Giovanis strongly denied the allegations, saying they were fully aware that the approach was bogus and that they only played along to extract more information from the representative in order to file a report with Cypriot law enforcement authorities.

Giovanis on Tuesday resigned his seat in the Cypriot Parliament and quit his duties as a member of the communist-rooted AKEL party.

Cypriot Attorney-General George Savvides said that he instructed police to initiate an in-depth police investigation” to determine if any criminal acts had been committed.

European Commission spokesman Christian Wigand said the bloc’s executive body is looking into launching infringement proceedings against Cyprus.

We watched in disbelief how high-level officials were trading European citizenship for financial gains, Wigand told reporters in Brussels. European Commission President (Ursula) von der Leyen was clear when saying European values are not for sale. Wigand said the Commission had frequently raised concerns about such investor citizenship schemes and also directly with Cypriot authorities.

Outraged Cypriots took to social media to heap scorn on the officials, with many calling for Syllouris’ resignation.

Al Jazeera accused of smear campaign

In a statement on Tuesday, Syllouris said that he would step back from his duties as of next week until an investigation is completed. He apologised for the unfortunate picture and upheaval that the staged and fragmented report gave and which allowed his reputation and that of the institution of House Speaker to be sullied.

Cypriot officials had earlier accused Al Jazeera of an orchestrated smear campaign against the ethnically split island nation.

The program has attracted many foreigner investors because a Cyprus passport automatically grants its holder citizenship access to the entire 27-member European Union. Around 4,000 Cypriot passports have been issued to investors under the program, generating more than 7 billion euros ($8.25 billion).

The Cyprus government has conceded that mistakes were made and has beefed up eligibility criteria in recent years. The most recent changes that lawmakers approved in August include new anti-money-laundering vetting rules and making it easier to revoke the citizenship of investors involved in or convicted of a serious crime.

Despite the stricter rules, the program continued to be hounded by allegations of corruption, kickbacks and favoritism.

Cyprus’ Audit Office last month urged lawmakers to rethink legislation that empowered the government to grant citizenship to investors’ family members.

Cyprus Security and Exchange Commission recommended last month that authorities revoke citizenship from seven individuals who submitted forged documents in their application.

An independent committee has been set up to probe thousands of applications that were made since 2007. The investment program had gathered pace after 2013, when a financial crisis nearly brought Cyprus to bankruptcy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gythi4/article32850690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDCYPRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cyprus-cancels-maligned-golden-passport-scheme/article32850691.ece
23,2020/10/14,Pak military’s economic interests reason for ‘creeping coup’: PPP spokesperson,"Good relations with India would help advance democratic norms and civilian supremacy in Pakistan, says Farhatullah Babar

The “creeping coup” in Pakistan is a result of the powerful military trying to safeguard its economic interests which might not be protected in a federal and democratic system, the spokesperson of an opposition party has said while calling for changing the basis of the country’s relations with India.

Addressing the fifth annual conference of South Asians Against Terrorism and for Human Rights (SAATH), Pakistan People’s Party spokesman and former Senator Farhatullah Babar said Pakistan’s Parliament was unable to hold the military accountable.

“In their hearts, Pakistan’s generals do not accept the country’s Constitution. That is why they have built a national narrative that is against democratic values and puts the army above all institutions,” he said at the event from Pakistan through a video conference.

Mr. Babar called for changing the basis of Pakistan’s relations with India, which he said had been predicated on the resolution of the Kashmir issue as Pakistan wants it.

“If China and India can have trade relations despite their conflicts, why can’t Pakistan? He asked, hinting that good relations with India would help advance democratic norms and civilian supremacy in Pakistan.

He said the “creeping coup” in Pakistan was the result of the powerful military trying to safeguard its economic interests which might not be protected in a federal and democratic system.

Speaking at the virtual event from Islamabad, the former Senator said that the protests against the army that started in Pashtun tribal regions have now reached Punjab, the heartland of the Pakistan Army.

He said the young people are discovering that “the emperor has no clothes”, according to a statement issued by SAATH.

Mr. Babar lamented that Pakistan’s parliament was unable to hold the military accountable and was deprived of the most elementary information about the military’s spending and other matters.

“The hybrid regime is fighting a hybrid war against the people of Pakistan by curbs on media and freedom of expression,” he added.

In his remarks, Mr. Babbar expressed hope that the exiled members of SAATH, a grouping of prodemocracy Pakistanis co-founded by former Pakistan ambassador the U, Husain Haqqani and US-based columnist, Dr. Mohammad Taqi, could speak out about matters that can no longer be raised in Pakistan’s repressed media.

Mohsin Dawar, a member of the National Assembly from Waziristan and a leading figure in Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), said that the regime was trying to bring the Taliban back to power and to break the bond between the Pashtuns on both sides of the Durand Line.

Mr. Dawar also expressed concern over Pakistan’s survivability, asserting that the people of Pakistan seem fed up with the army’s dominance and intrusion in all spheres of life.

“If the political leaders fail, the people will definitely stand up against the dictatorship,” he observed.

Former parliamentarian Bushra Gohar said that young Pakistanis, lawyers, and women have started challenging the status quo in Pakistan and the “repressive” regime cannot prevail forever.

Ms. Gohar questioned “secret talks between Pakistan’s military leaders and US Special Envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad over the future of Afghanistan, which have serious implications for Pakistan’s Pashtuns.

She called for demilitarisation of the Pashtun region.

Resolutions passed by participants also condemned enforced disappearances and erosion of freedom of expression.

Most speakers also criticised Pakistan’s major political parties for compromising often with the military, instead of ensuring civilian supremacy under the Constitution.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4ykvss/article32850037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDPAKBABAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pak-militarys-economic-interests-reason-for-creeping-coup-ppp-spokesperson/article32850038.ece
24,2020/10/14,First lady Melania unseen as Donald Trump restarts campaign after COVID-19,"Melania Trump last provided a health update over a week ago after saying her symptoms were mild.

President Donald Trump and his wife received their positive COVID-19 tests on the same day. He’s already returned to campaigning, but there’s been no public sighting yet of the first lady.

Melania Trump last provided a health update over a week ago after saying her symptoms were mild, and the White House has not indicated when she will make her next public appearance.

What role she will play in the campaign’s final weeks remains an open question as Mr. Trump embarks on a schedule of daily rallies through the November 3 election.

“My family is grateful for all of the prayers & support! I am feeling good & will continue to rest at home,” the first lady tweeted on October 5, three days after the President announced they both had the disease caused by the coronavirus and that they would quarantine.

“Thank you to medical staff & caretakers everywhere, & my continued prayers for those who are ill or have a family member impacted by the virus,” she said.

No update

Ms. Trump was last seen on September 29 accompanying the President to Cleveland for his nationally televised debate with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Before that trip, she attended a September 26 gathering in the White House Rose Garden that is now believed to have been a super spreader event for the virus. The President introduced Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett to scores of guests who sat close together, many without face coverings. Several guests later tested positive for COVID-19.

The first lady’s office provided no update on Tuesday on her condition. The President’s campaign referred questions to the White House.

A possible upside for the White House in the positive test results is that they overshadowed the release of audio recordings by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former confidante and adviser to the first lady, in which Ms. Trump was heard complaining about having to decorate the mansion for Christmas.

She also was heard downplaying the conditions in which migrant children were housed in U.S. detention centers after the administration separated them from their families at the Mexico border.

Ms. Wolkoff detailed her falling out with Ms. Trump in a new book the White House has dismissed as full of mistruths and paranoia. Ms. Wolkoff also had confirmed she had Ms. Trump on tape.

David B. Cohen, political science professor at the University of Akron, said the tapes were damaging for the first lady’s image, especially since the President often bragged that he was singularly responsible for people saying Merry Christmas again.

By keeping her behind closed doors, it makes it sort of a non-story at this point, Mr. Cohen said.

Contrasting recoveries

Most coronavirus patients suffer mild to moderate symptoms and recover quickly, typically anywhere from two to six weeks, according to the World Health Organization, though older, sicker patients tend to take longer to get well.

The President’s quicker reemergence again highlights differences in how he, at age 74, and the first lady, who is 50, have approached the pandemic — from mask wearing to travel.

The White House has said their son, Barron, 14, tested negative for the virus.

President Trump was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for treatment on October 2, and was sent home three days later.

He remained out of public view until this past weekend, when he stepped onto a balcony to address a large crowd of supporters who had been invited to the White House lawn to watch him speak.

On Monday, a week after leaving the hospital, the President — who has declared himself immune to COVID-19, although the science makes it impossible to know that — resumed the rigors of campaigning at a Florida rally. His White House doctor said Mr. Trump tested negative for the virus on consecutive days and was no longer considered contagious.

Mr. Trump has an aggressive schedule with campaign rallies set for every day this week in Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and back to Florida.

Former Trump White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Ms. Trump may want to be a little bit more selective about how she reengages after recovery. The first lady is known to be intensely private and someone who operates on her own timetable.

She just may be taking a different approach to this as well, Mr. Spicer said.

Ms. Trump has been more consistent about encouraging use of face masks while her husband has vacillated between describing mask-wearing as patriotic and criticising Mr. Biden for routinely donning one. Mr. Trump was mask-free on Monday. Neither Mr. Trump nor the first lady wore masks at the Rose Garden event.

Mr. Trump also travelled extensively during the height of the pandemic, including to hot spot cities, while his wife waited until mid-September to visit New Hampshire on her first solo appearance outside the Washington area since the outbreak.

COVID-19 isn’t Ms. Trump’s first bout with illness at the White House.

She spent a week at Walter Reed military hospital in May 2018 after undergoing an embolisation procedure to treat what her office said was a benign kidney condition. Ms. Trump convalesced at the White House for nearly a month before she resumed a public schedule.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ek2ud8/article32849910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKTRUMPTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/first-lady-unseen-as-trump-restarts-campaign-after-covid-19/article32849911.ece

26,2020/10/14,"China and Russia win seats on U.N. rights council, Saudis lose","Russia and Cuba were running unopposed, but China and Saudi Arabia were in a five-way race in the only contested race for seats on the Human Rights Council.

China, Russia and Cuba won seats on the U.N.’s premiere human rights body on October 13 despite opposition from activist groups over their abysmal human rights records, but another target, Saudi Arabia, lost.

Russia and Cuba were running unopposed, but China and Saudi Arabia were in a five-way race in the only contested race for seats on the Human Rights Council.

In secret-ballot voting in the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on that race, Pakistan received 169 votes, Uzbekistan 164, Nepal 150, China 139 and Saudi Arabia just 90 votes.

Despite announced reform plans by Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch and others strongly opposed its candidacy saying the Middle East nation continues to target human rights defenders, dissidents and women’s rights activists and has demonstrated little accountability for past abuses, including the killing of Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two years ago.

Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now, the organisation founded by Khashoggi, said despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin on public relations to cover his grotesque abuses, the international community just isn’t buying it.

Unless Saudi Arabia undertakes dramatic reforms to release political prisoners, end its disastrous war in Yemen and allow its citizens meaningful political participation, it will remain a global pariah, Whitson said.

Under the Human Rights Council’s rules, seats are allocated to regions to ensure geographical representation.

Except for the Asia-Pacific contest, the election of 15 members to the 47-member Human Rights Council was all but decided in advance because all the other regional groups had uncontested slates.

Four countries won four Africa seats: Ivory Coast, Malawi, Gabon and Senegal. Russia and Ukraine won the two East European seats. In the Latin American and Caribbean group, Mexico, Cuba and Bolivia won the three open seats. And Britain and France won the two seats for the Western European and others group.

“Saudi Arabia’s failure to win a seat on the Human Rights Council is a welcome reminder of the need for more competition in U.N. elections,” Human Rights Watch’s U.N. director, Louis Charbonneau, said after the results were announced. “Had there been additional candidates, China, Cuba and Russia might have lost too,” he said.

But the addition of these undeserving countries won’t prevent the council from shining a light on abuses and speaking up for victims. In fact, by being on the council, these abusers will be directly in the spotlight.

Mr. Charbonneau earlier criticised U.N. member states, including Western nations, saying: They don’t want competition. ... Essentially these are backroom deals that are worked out among the regional groups.

Last week, a coalition of human rights groups from Europe, the United States and Canada called on U.N. member states to oppose the election of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, saying their human rights records make them unqualified.

Electing these dictatorships as U.N. judges on human rights is like making a gang of arsonists into the fire brigade, said Hillel Neuer, Executive Director of U.N. Watch.

The Geneva-based rights organisation published a 30-page joint report with the Human Rights Foundation and the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights evaluating candidates for council seats.

The report lists Bolivia, Ivory Coast, Nepal, Malawi, Mexico, Senegal and Ukraine — all winners — as having questionable credentials due to problematic human rights and U.N. voting records that need improvement. It gave qualified ratings only to the United Kingdom and France.

Human Rights Watch pointed to an unprecedented call by 50 U.N. experts on June 26 for decisive measures to protect fundamental freedoms in China, warning about its mass rights violations in Hong Kong and Tibet and against ethnic Uighurs in the Chinese province of Xinjiang as well as attacks on rights defenders, journalists, lawyers and government critics. Their call was echoed by over 400 civil society groups from more than 60 countries.

Of the four winners of seats in the Asia-Pacific group, China got the lowest vote.

The rights group said Russia’s military operations with the Syrian government have deliberately or indiscriminately killed civilians and destroyed hospitals and other protected civilian infrastructure in violation of international humanitarian law, and noted Russia’s veto of U.N. Security Council resolutions on Syria, including blocking Damascus’ referral to the International Criminal Court.

The Geneva-based Human Rights Council can spotlight abuses and has special monitors watching certain countries and issues. It also periodically reviews human rights in every U.N. member country.

Created in 2006 to replace a commission discredited because of some members’ poor rights records, the new council soon came to face similar criticism, including that rights abusers sought seats to protect themselves and their allies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lq2mh1/article32849338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-human-rights-council-afp,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-and-russia-win-seats-on-un-rights-council-saudis-lose/article32849339.ece
27,2020/10/14,U.S. presidential election | Biden to older voters: Punish Trump with ballot,"Joe Biden blasted Donald Trump’s efforts to upend the 2010 Affordable Care Act that boosted some Medicare coverage for seniors.

Joe Biden is urging older voters in Florida to punish President Donald Trump at the ballot box for his divisive and chaotic leadership and his careless and reckless response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr. Biden told a small group at a senior community centre in Broward County on October 13 that the only senior Donald Trump seems to care about is himself. The Democrat noted the disproportionate effect that the coronavirus has had on older Americans and said Mr. Trump is stuck in the sand traps at his golf club.

Mr. Trump won Florida narrowly four years ago and has almost no path to victory if he doesn’t win the state’s 29 electoral votes again. Democrats say shifts among older voters in a state heavy on retirees make it a prime pickup opportunity for Mr. Biden.

Mr. Biden blasted Mr. Trump’s efforts to upend the 2010 Affordable Care Act that boosted some Medicare coverage for seniors.

And he panned Mr. Trump’s proposals to suspend Social Security taxes and send $200 prescription cards to seniors. Mr. Biden noted that both moves would drain the trust funds that pay for the programmes’ current benefits.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2folbe/article32849241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-JOEBIDEN-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-election-biden-to-older-voters-punish-trump-with-ballot/article32849242.ece

29,2020/10/14,Facebook bans anti-vaccination ads but not antivax posts,"Facebook is addressing the anti-vaxxers of 2014 and 2015 and not the anti-vaxxers of 2020, said an expert skeptical of the move.

Facebook says it will ban ads on its platform that discourage vaccinations — with an exception carved out for advocacy ads about government vaccine policies.

The company already bans ads about vaccine “hoaxes”, such as the false idea that vaccinations cause autism. The latest policy expands the ban to ads that discourage vaccines for any reason.

But Facebook also said on Tuesday that ads that advocate for or against legislation or government policies around vaccines — including a COVID-19 vaccine — will still be allowed. These ads will still have to be approved by the company as political advertisements and include a paid for by label on who is funding them.

And unpaid posts by people or groups that discourage vaccinations will also still be allowed — the new policy only includes paid advertisements.

The social network said it will also run an information campaign encouraging people to get their flu shots this year.

Facebook has taken other steps to try to stop the spread of vaccine and coronavirus-related misinformation on its platform. Last year, it said it would begin hiding groups and pages that spread misinformation about vaccinations from the search function of its site.

Since the pandemic began, the company has tightened its rules around COVID-related misinformation. For instance, it promotes articles that debunk COVID-19 misinformation, of which there are thousands, on a new information center called Get The Facts. It also bans what it deems “dangerous” misinformation about the virus and has removed posts by President Donald Trump under this policy.

Some experts were skeptical about the move.

Facebook is addressing the anti-vaxxers of 2014 and 2015 and not the anti-vaxxers of 2020, said David A. Broniatowski, an associate professor at George Washington University’s school of engineering and applied science who has published several studies on vaccine misinformation.

Mr. Broniatowski published a study in 2019 that found that the majority of anti-vaccine misinformation being pushed in advertisements on Facebook were coming from two groups, including one led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and a California-based organization called Stop Mandatory Vaccination.

Facebook by banning anti-vaccine ads is probably not banning more than half of the ads, he said. “I understand where they are coming from that they want to promote civil engagement but at the same time, if their intention is to reduce the amount of anti-vaccine misinformation, they are not addressing the largest source of that misinformation.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/h9afpe/article32698883.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-FACEBOOK-CRITICS-OVERSIGHTBOARD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/facebook-bans-anti-vaccination-ads-but-not-antivax-posts/article32850050.ece
30,2020/10/14,Bihar Assembly elections | Tejashwi ready to contest from Nitish home turf Nalanda,"He aldo hits back at Union Minister Nitya Nand Rai’s ‘terrorist” comment

While leaving his residence to file nomination from the Raghopur Aassembly constituency in Vaishali district of Bihar on Wednesday, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and Opposition “mahagathbandhan” (grand alliance) chief minister face Tejashwi Yadav dared Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to contest poll against him from any constituency of his choice from his (Mr. Kumar’s) own home turf, Nalanda district.

Also read: Left to contest Bihar poll under Mahagathbandhan

Mr. Yadav said, “Let him [Nitish Kumar] select any one constituency of his choice from his home district Nalanda and I’ll contest against him. Bihar is heading for a change”.

Mr. Yadav also hit back at Union Minister Nitya Nand Rai for his comment that if “the RJD would come to power in Bihar, terrorists from Kashmir will take shelter in the State”. He said, “What does he [Mr. Rai] have to say on the terror of unemployment, poverty, starvation & migration?... What did their double-engine govt do in 15 years?... It’s their attempt to divert people’s attention from the main agenda”.

At a public gathering in Vaishali on Tuesday, Mr. Rai said, “terrorists whom we [the NDA government] are eliminating from Kashmir will escape and take shelter in Bihar, if the RJD is elected to power. We will not let this happen.”

Mr. Tejashwi Yadav, on the occasion, took blessings from his mother, former Chief Minister Rabri Devi; a photo-frame of his imprisoned father Lalu Prasad; and older brother Tej Pratap Yadav, by touching their feet.

Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Tej Pratap filed his nomination from the Hasanpur constituency and Mr. Tejashwi Yadav had addressed a crowded public meeting there.

Jobs for youth promise

Mr Tejashwi Yadav reiterated his promise that if his government would come to power, “the first thing he would do in the first Cabinet meeting of the government is to provide 10 lakh jobs to unemployed youths”.

Mr. Kumar responded, saying: “The voters should find out how many cabinet meetings used to take place during his parents [Mr.Prasad and Ms. Devi) regime for 15 years”, and Mr. Tejashwi Yadav retorted, saying: “lets debate on my 20 months in his [Mr. Nitish Kumar)’s Cabinet as Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Road Construction”.

31,2020/10/14,"Bihar Assembly elections | Yet again, parties across the spectrum field Bihar’s 'bahubalis'","To counter the possibility of disqualification, several wives of ‘dons’ and strongmen are in the fray as well

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may have been reiterating in his virtual and actual poll campaign meetings that rule of law has been established in the State in the last 15 years of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) regime, but come election time and Bihar appears as it was in 1990s — when bahubalis (strongmen) made headlines. In this Assembly poll, too, almost all the parties have fielded similarly fearsome “dons”, or their wives, to add extra numbers to their final winning tally.

In the first phase poll for 71 seats on October 28, out of 353 candidates, 164 have a tainted image, with serious criminal cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion, rape and kidnapping arrayed against them. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) tops the list, followed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and the Janata Dal-United (JD-U).

The RJD candidate from the Mokama Assembly constituency, Anant Singh, faces as many as 38 criminal cases of murder, extortion, kidnapping, and possession of illegal weapons. He is currently lodged in jail and had won the previous 2015 Assembly poll from Mokama as an Independent candidate. Earlier, he had represented the constituency in 2005 and 2010 on a JD(U) ticket. Not willing to take the risk of his disqualification on any grounds, his wife Neelam Devi too has filed her nomination from the same seat as an Independent candidate.

Similarly, the RJD surprised everyone by giving a ticket in the last hour to a dreaded criminal-turned-politician from Danapur, Ritlal Yadav, who faces 33 criminal cases of murder, extortion and money laundering. Ritlal Yadav is the main accused in the murder of former BJP leader Satyanarayan Sinha in 2003. Sinha’s widow Asha Singh has been winning the Danapur Assembly seat for the last three consecutive terms on a BJP ticket, and this time she will be facing Ritlal Yadav to continue her winning streak. Yadav was released from Patna’s Beur jail in August this year, after being granted bail by the Patna High Court in a money laundering case.

Earlier, the RJD had roped in Karisma Rai, a cousin of RJD party leader Tej Pratap Yadav’s estranged wife Aishwarya Rai, to contest the poll from the Danapur seat, and she had started meeting people from the area for quite some time, but was denied the ticket at the last moment. “Such is the clout of dreaded criminal Ritlal Yadav in the RJD,” quipped a local BJP leader in Danapur.

The Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) has fielded a former Maoist Sudhir Kumar Verma, who faces 37 criminal cases, from the Gurua Assembly constituency in Gaya district.

The RJD candidate from the Atri Assembly constituency, Ajay Yadav, and the JD(U) candidate from Belaganj, Abhay Kumar Singh, face 14 criminal cases each.

The LJP has given a ticket to Hulas Pandey from the Brahmpur seat. He is the younger brother of dreaded criminal-turned-politician Sunil Pandey, and also faces several criminal cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion.

However, many of the bahubalis (strongmen) facing serious criminal cases and unable to get party tickets to contest the polls have switched over to proxies by projecting their wives as candidates. “This is a dangerous trend in democracy but not a new phenomena for the Bihar elections,” said political analyst Ajay Kumar.

Vibha Devi, wife of former RJD MLA and rape accused Raj Ballabh Yadav, has been given a party ticket to contest polls from the Nawada seat, while Kiran Devi, wife of absconding sitting RJD MLA Arun Kumar Yadav, has been given the RJD ticket from Sandesh constituency.

Similarly, Veena Singh, wife of another bahubali turned politician Ramakishor Singh, is contesting the poll from the Mahnar seat in Vaishali district on an RJD ticket. It was Ramakishor Singh’s likely induction into the party that was vehemently opposed by the late Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, senior RJD leader and party MP for several terms from the Vaishali Lok Sabha seat, who died recently at a Delhi hospital. After his death, Ramkishor Singh managed to get an RJD ticket for his wife.

Both former MP Lovely Anand and her son Chetan Anand got RJD tickets for the Saharsa and Sheohar Assembly constituencies. Lovely Anand is the wife of imprisoned don-turned-neta Anand Mohan Singh, who is serving a life sentence in the Saharsha jail in connection with the murder case of a District Magistrate G. Krishnaiah in 1994 in Muzaffarpur town.

The ruling JD(U), too, has fielded wives of several bahubalis like Manoranjan Singh Dhumal, Awadhesh Mandal and Bindi Yadav from the Ekma, Rupauli and Atri Assembly constituencies, respectively.

The JD(U) has also given a ticket to Manju Verma from the Cheria-Bariyarpur seat — Ms. Verma had to resign from CM Nitish Kumar’s Cabinet as Social Welfare Minister after she, along with her husband Chandrashekhar Verma, was sent to jail in connection with the infamous Muzaffarpur shelter home abuse case.

The BJP has fielded Aruna Devi, wife of bahubali Akhilesh Singh, from the Nawada seat. Singh faces 27 criminals cases, including the Chakwai village massacre in Nawada district in which 10 people were killed in 2004.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/te9fh2/article32854383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANANTSINGHKB,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-yet-again-parties-across-the-spectrum-field-bihars-bahubalis/article32854387.ece

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address around 12 campaign rallies over four days between October 23- November 3 in Bihar.

Senior sources in Bihar BJP involved in firming up plans for these rallies told The Hindu that Mr. Modi would address at least 3-4 rallies a day at various locations.

“The venues have also been decided and include Patna, Gaya, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga et al,” said a source. The rallies will be a hybrid of real and virtual with some physical attendance and others to attend via smartphones, computers and tablets in possession of BJP workers.

33,2020/10/14,Bihar Assembly elections | Opposition merely reacting to NDA’s agendas: Kanhaiya Kumar,"The CPI leader said that unfortunately the agendas which were relevant to the State 15 years back continue to dominate the present polls

Taking a swipe at the ruling NDA in Bihar, CPI leader and former JNU students union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Wednesday said unfortunately the agendas which were relevant to the State 15 years back continue to dominate the present polls.

He lamented that in the ongoing polls in Bihar, the ruling coalition is setting the agendas and the opposition is only reacting to it instead of coming out with their own issues.

CPI is part of the RJD-led Grand Alliance in the Bihar elections. The left party is contesting on six seats in all three phases of the election as partner of the anti-NDA grouping.

Though Mr Kumar, who unsuccessfully contested 2019 General Election from his native Begusarai Lok Sabha seat, is not fighting the State elections, but he has been named among the star campaigners of his party for the polls.

Former JNUSU general secretary, Sandeep Saurav, has been fielded by CPI-ML, also a member of the grand alliance, from the Paliganj assembly seat in the outskirts of Patna.

Its yet not confirmed whether Kanhaiya Kumar as leader of the opposition grouping would seek vote for him at Paliganj.

Making a scathing attack on the Nitish Kumar government, the prominent youth leader said “even after ruling the State for 15 years he failed to solve the problems in the fields of education, health and other core sectors...Bihar still stands on the same position as it did 15 years ago in terms of development.”

The CPI leader’s jibe seems directed at puncturing the claims of Nitish Kumar of bringing an alround development in the State in last 15 years under him.

“The issues pertaining to basic needs of the people which were relevant in elections 15 years ago continue to dominate the political arena even in this election,” the former Jawaharlal Nehru University students union president told PTI-Bhasha in an interview.

“The ruling side is setting the agendas in the current State election and the opposition parties are merely reating to it. Opposition should set their own alternative agendas,” he said.

Coming down heavily on the NDA coalition at the Centre as well as in Bihar, the CPI leader said “through headline management they are diverting attention of the people from the basic issues guiding citizens daily lives.”

‘Utter confusion in ruling alliance’

Apparently refering to LJP which is contesting on its own in the Bihar polls with a promise to defeat the JD(U) and form the next government in the State with the BJP, he said “there is utter confusion in the ruling alliance as who is with whom and who is against whom.”

Asked if he accepts Tejashwi Yadav as the leader of the opposition grouping, he said “he is leader of the largest constituent of the coalition so it’s natural that he will be the leader and there is no question about it.”

34,2020/10/14,Bihar Assembly elections | Sharad Yadav’s daughter Subhashini joins Congress ahead of polls,"Ms. Yadav said that it is her moral responsibility to take forward her father’s legacy. She joined Congress at party headquarter 24 Akbar Road in presence of Bihar state unit chief Madan Mohan Jha

Janata Dal-United (JD-U) rebel Sharad Yadav’s daughter Subhashini Yadav joined the Congress party on Wednesday. Her father was expelled from the JD(U) for opposing Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s move to return to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).

Mr. Nitish Kumar resigned as Bihar Chief Minister in July 2017, less than two years after he had joined hands with his arch enemy Lalu Prasad Yadav to form the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ government in the 2015 Assembly polls. He returned as Chief Minister after he rejoined the NDA. Sharad Yadav, who opposed this move, spoke publicly against it on many platforms and was expelled for anti-party activities.

The Congress is likely to field Ms. Yadav from the Bihariganj Assembly segment in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections, which falls under Madhepura Lok Sabha seat. Her father, Sharad Yadav, has represented the Madhepura Lok Sabha seat four times in the past.

She joined the Congress at the party headquarters, 24 Akbar Road, in the presence of Bihar State unit chief Madan Mohan Jha.

Speaking to The Hindu minutes after joining the party, the 30-year-old Ms. Yadav said that this election was not about holding any personal grudges or avenging her father. “This election is only about development and bringing about a change in the State,” Ms. Yadav said.

Soon after being expelled from JD(U), her father had launched the Jan Loktantrik Party that didn’t take off. He also formed a platform, Sanjhi Virasat, to bring together all secular and like-minded parties, which saw multi-city events with all leading politicians. On the basis of the JD(U)’s plea, he was also disqualified from the Rajya Sabha. He is still fighting the case in court; his term as Rajya Sabha member ends in 2022.

Ms. Yadav thanked Congress treasurer Ahmed Patel and other senior leaders for inviting her to join the party. “My father is unwell, so he will not be able to physically campaign for me, but will be addressing virtual rallies. He has always stood with the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ so it was only obvious for me to join hands with them,” Ms. Yadav said.

She evaded questions on Nitish Kumar and the JD(U). “My father is one of the founding members of the JD(U). And his so-called expulsion from the party is still a sub judice matter, so I would not like to comment on it,” she said.

Along with her, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader and former MP Kali Pandey also joined the party. Mr. Pandey shifted loyalties from the LJP five days after the death of LJP patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan. He said that the LJP was not democratic and that party president Chirag Paswan did not meet State functionaries.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/2yg39s/article32281216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THMain2NTHGGS17LA9IT3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/sharad-yadavs-daughter-subhashini-joins-congress-ahead-of-bihar-polls/article32852934.ece

36,2020/10/14,Shaheen falcon displays amazing hunting skills at grassland near Chennai,"City birder Karthik Ramamurthy photographs a rare phenomenon during lockdown: the gutsy Shaheen falcon in action at Kanchipuram lake

Water birds at the Kanchipuram lake are heaving a sigh of relief. A fearsome predator, that stalked them over the past few months, has finally gone home. For now, things are back to normal at the grassland.

A Shaheen falcon, a sub-species of the fastest predator on earth, the Peregrine falcon, had visited the region from its home in the hills for the monsoon.

“I first spotted the bird, a juvenile female, towards the end of June,” says Chennai birder Karthik Ramamurthy. Karthik, who takes birding enthusiasts along with him on his expeditions, kept visiting the grassland the following months to see, photograph, and consequently, fall in love with the bird. “I witnessed 44 of her kills,” says Karthik, who cannot stop raving about the “bold and gutsy” beauty.

News of her arrival near Chennai was enough to draw several local birders to the location. Among them, was K Gnanaskandan. “What makes this sighting precious is that this bird is a monsoon visitor,” says Gnanaskandan. “And that it put up a prolonged show, displaying effortless hunting techniques. It is not a rare sighting, but the bird’s skills make it rather special.”

Karthik spent as much time as he could with the bird. “Sixty-six days to be precise,” he says. Tracking the raptor, he recalls, was tough. “Out of the 40 plus hunts I mentioned, except one black drongo, cattle egret, and Indian roller, the rest were all Indian pond herons,” he explains, adding how on some days, the entire grassland got emptied of pond herons.

“She hunted with ease and grace and did stoops and level flight chasing at lightning speed,” he adds. At one instance, Karthik remembers a pond heron taking cover underneath his car. But the Shaheen pursued the bird and in the end, won her meal.

Shaheen falcons are mountain birds, explains Karthik. “They breed in the Western and Eastern Ghats and visit Chennai and its surrounding regions between May and September. Sightings peak in July and August,” he points out.

When he spotted the bird towards the end of last month, Karthik knew it was the last time he was seeing her. “Another falcon coming from Europe was there and I was sure it will chase her away,” he says.

Now that she is back home, Karthik does feel sad that he cannot see the bird any more, having spent so many hours in her company. “I named her Jhansi Rani,” he says. “Perhaps I will see her next year.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/ncbd9e/article32853546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15mpFalcon-2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/shaheen-falcon-displays-amazing-hunting-skills-at-grassland-near-chennai/article32853548.ece
37,2020/10/14,Navratri tradition of ‘bommai golu’ goes online this year due to COVID-19,"The nine-day affair of Navratri prepares to don a new garb this year. Virtual challenges and ’bommai golu’-hopping via Zoom keep the the age-old South Indian tradition alive

R Bharathan, 50, from Chennai is excited about the new addition to his golu collection — a Bhadrachala Rama doll. Bought from Mylapore, the doll will be the showstopper of his seven-step golu arrangement this year. However, he is apprehensive about celebrations this year, given the ongoing pandemic.

“We need to be cautious. We will limit the number of invitees and keep hand sanitisers at the entrance of our home,” says Bharathan. On the other hand, Priya Raman from Bay Area, California, plans to welcome her visitors and visit others virtually, via Zoom calls.

Celebrated for nine nights and one day, the festival of Navratri is an ode to the many forms of goddess Shakti.

The South Indian Navratri tradition of displaying dolls (bommai golu) arranged on an odd number of steps, includes inviting guests home to sing together, share bowls of piping hot sundal and go golu hopping. This year is different.

Virtually dolled-up

In place of large get-togethers, virtual efforts to keep the tradition relevant are gaining pace.

Penmai, the Coimbatore-based online discussion forum for women is organising a virtual golu challenge this year. Ilavarasi Johnson, its founder, explains the rules, “At least three photos must be submitted, with different angles, along with captions before October 30, to the Penmai portal (www.penmai.com/community/). Short videos can also be submitted. A five-membered panel will judge the entries and winners will be awarded golu dolls.”

Sailaja Shivakumar, head of Sriram Samruddhi, an e-commerce platform selling eco-friendly dolls from Hyderabad is also inviting participants to make short videos of their arrangements (sriramsamruddhi@gmail.com). She insists on village-themed golus arranged using eco-friendly dolls, in which few of the dolls must be Sriram Samruddhi’s. She justifies, “This is to support our artisans who have been working hard despite the pandemic.”

For many, golu hopping is a show of solidarity between families. S Kamala, a 60-year-old homemaker from Chennai, explains the significance of giving thamboolam — an assortment of betel leaves and areca nuts presented with any fruit, sweet or other gifts — during golu visits.

Hunting for home made dolls? Vidya Madhavan sells quilling and polymer clay dolls on Etsy store in the range of ₹1000 to 15000 rupees. She makes real-life contemporary themed miniatures like street-vendors. You can find her @maayacrafts on Instagram.

Lakshmi Palanissamy sells quilling dolls through social media (lakshmiquillingworld) in the range ₹400 to ₹3000 rupees. Yoga dolls are the most sought-after.

Ranjini Venugopal under her Instagram handle, @deepashreearts sells wooden dolls that depict gods and other miscellaneous figurines that can be used as both golu dolls and gift articles. Her dolls range between ₹1000 and ₹3500.

“Till date, South Indian marriages are finalised with the exchange of thamboolam between the families of the bride and the groom. During Navratri, however, it is given to kith and kin who arrive to see the golu, to establish togetherness,” she says.

Gifts too have been updated for 2020. Kamala, for instance, plans to gift people handmade embroidered masks to create awareness.

In Bengaluru, Manjula Prasad is skipping the traditonal Gombe Habba. The 48-year-old teacher shares the legend behind the sister festival: “To help goddess Durga kill the demon Mahishasura, all the gods and other living and non-living beings share their energies and powers with her, and in turn become statues. To commemorate their sacrifice, Gombe Habba is celebrated and the statues are displayed and worshipped for nine days.”

This year, she will be sending sweets to family and friends all through the nine days, which she believes is the safest way to celebrate.

On the lookout

With international travel being restricted, Priya who usually stocks up on dolls during her visit to India, found herself surfing Etsy this year to add to her collection. She buys at least one to five dolls every year. E-commerce sales for dolls are seeing a rise in 2020, especially internationally.

Artisans who do not have access to e-commerce are facing some hurdles. J Muthukumar, of Coimbatore who makes miniature structures of temples using foam board, says, “I made a profit of ₹1.5 lakhs last year. This year I am expecting only ₹1 lakh.” He, along with his wife, is currently selling his temple structures in Poompuhar, Coimbatore in the range of ₹400 to ₹15,000. Self-employed quilling doll-maker Lakshmi Palanissamy from Chengalpattu also says that sales came in late this year, starting only from August. Yet she is hopeful: “With every version of unlock, I am getting more orders. I am expecting sales for around ₹20 to 30K”

On the upside, this lockdown has also given people the time and energy to make their own dolls. Ranjini Venugopal, from Pennsylvania, has begun to sell them as well. “Doll making for me is more of a hobby turned into a small business,” says Ranjini. She buys precut wooden pieces and assembles them to create the final product.

“They have to be primed and smoothed. After which I draw, paint and outline them. After gluing together the various parts, I give a final coat of gloss varnish for a finished product,” she says. “Each year is unique and has its own memories attached to it. These days, I like to involve my daughters in the setting up of the golu and enjoy their imagination.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/d7vono/article32852622.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Golu-1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/navratri-and-golu-goes-online-this-year/article32852628.ece

Powered by RuPay, the ‘Salary Card’ comes with a feature that allows consumers the flexibility of setting up a credit limit to suit shopping, medical, travel, entertainment and other needs.

A customer can activate the ‘Salary Card’ within seconds by accessing the EarlySalary mobile app,” the company said.

Akshay Mehrotra, CEO and co-founder, EarlySalary said “We aim to make credit access easier to India's digitally-savvy young generation, which drives the major consumption of products and Internet services, especially during the pandemic period.”

“The rise of zero-touch experience and the increasing credit demand, even from small towns and villages have inspired us to launch the Salary Card,” he added.

41,2020/10/14,Army chief to visit Nepal in November,"The visit will be keenly watched as it will take place months after Nepal revised its political map and claimed the strategically important region of Kalapani-Lipulekh-Limpiyadhura in the Pithoragarh district of India.

Chief of the Army Staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane will visit Nepal in November, the Nepal Army has announced.

The visit will be keenly watched as it will take place months after Nepal revised its political map and claimed the strategically important region of Kalapani-Lipulekh-Limpiyadhura in the Pithoragarh district of India.

“General Manoj Mukund Naravane, Chief of the Army Staff, Indian Army will visit Nepal in November this year. The visit was approved by the Government of Nepal on 3rd February 2020 but was postponed due to lockdown in both the countries,” a Nepal Army spokesperson said in a statement.

Nepal and Indian armies have maintained fraternal ties and a large number of Gurkha citizens of Nepal are employed in the Indian Army. During the visit, General Naravane is expected to hold talks with his counterpart General Purna Chandra Thapa. President Bidhya Devi Bhandari is scheduled to bestow the title of honorary chief of Nepal Army to General Naravane.

The region of Lipulekh is of strategic importance to India and the Indian military maintains a sizeable presence there. While General Thapa has maintained a studied silence about the Kalapani issue, General Naravane, however, stirred controversy by referring to “third party” presence that probably prompted Nepal to raise the Kalapani issue. The statement that General Naravane made in May hit the headlines and drew a strong response from the political class of Nepal. Subsequently, Nepal Army too began building security installations near the Indian border region in Kalapani.

This controversy was followed by Nepal’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali demanding changes in the 1947 U.K.-India-Nepal agreement to review the terms of Gurkha employment in the Indian armed forces. The visit of General Naravane is likely to coincide with the first anniversary of the publication of the revised political map of India. The new political map of India was published in November 2019 which showed the new Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The map also drew protest from Nepal as it showed Indian claims over the Kalapani region.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/itr82r/article31925548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARMYCHIEFKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/army-chief-to-visit-nepal-in-november/article32856663.ece
42,2020/10/14,Advocates slam Jagan Mohan Reddy’s letter to CJI,"The contents of letter and its release to media lacked propriety, says the advocates association

The Supreme Court Advocates-On-Record Association (SCAORA) has issued a statement condemning a letter written by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy against a sitting Supreme Court judge.

The SCAORA said the judge was the next in line to be the Chief Justice of India. Justice N.V. Ramana is the next in line as CJI as per seniority.

“SCAORA notes, with deep anguish, the contents of the letter dated 06.10.2020, written by a Chief Minister to Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India, concerning a sitting Judge of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India next in line to become the Chief Justice of India,” the letter said.

The contents of the letter, dated October 6, and its release to the media in a press conference lacked propriety and tended to “scandalise and breach the independence of the judiciary,” the SCAORA said in a resolution on Tuesday.

The Delhi High Court Bar Association has also condemned Mr. Reddy’s statements as an affront to independence of judiciary.

A writ petition was also filed in the Supreme Court by advocate G.S. Mani alleging that “false, vague and political allegations” surface when a Supreme Court judge is marked for appointment as CJI.

He said that however this was the first time a person holding a constitutional post, like Mr. Reddy, was “misusing his official post.”

Another petition filed by a lawyer, Sunil Kumar Singh, urged the apex court to issue an order to bar Mr. Reddy from making public statements against the judiciary and holding press conferences to malign the judicial institution.

The Constitution does not allow such deliberate attempt to publicly embarrass the judiciary. “What is at stake is the confidence that courts inspire in the public in a democracy,” this petition said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-assembly/wup3rj/article32825110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJJAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/advocates-slam-jagans-letter-to-cji/article32856625.ece
43,2020/10/14,Coronavirus | Crucial times ahead: Health Minister Harsh Vardhan,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the ‘Jan Andolan’ earlier this month to alert people on appropriate behaviour ahead of the festive season

The next two-and-a-half months were going to be crucial in India’s “fight against COVID-19 because of the winter season and the festival season,” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said at a meeting to review activities under a ‘Jan Andolan’.

The virtual meeting was to review the activities taken on “COVID-19 appropriate behaviour” and involved the Minister as well as heads of AIIMS and Central government hospitals, on Wednesday. COVID-19 appropriate behaviour includes wearing face-covers, masks, and observing physical distancing. “We have created significant infrastructure for our fight against COVID, which includes over 90 lakh beds, over 12,000 quarantine centres and more than 1,900 labs,” he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the ‘Jan Andolan’ earlier this month to alert people on appropriate behaviour ahead of the festive season.

“India was continuously recording new milestones in treatment of Covid. Our recovery rate is the highest in the world and the fatality is among the lowest in the world. The active cases are constantly declining. All the parameters have proven the success of the COVID-19 containment strategy followed by all States and Union territories. We have successfully ramped up our testing capacity which has crossed 9 Cr today. India also has now become self reliant in terms of masks and PPE kits which we earlier used to import.”

India’s total recovered cases stood at 6,301,927 on Wednesday.

In a sharp drop, Kerala on Wednesday recorded 6,244 COVID-19 cases, when 50,056 samples were tested.

The test positivity rate, which was 18.16% the previous day, plunged to 12.4% on Wednesday with no explanation.

Last week too, the State’s case graph had dived mid-week, only to go up the next day and the shift was attributed to a statistical aberration. With 20 more deaths from previous weeks being added to the official list, the State’s cumulative deaths stood at 1,066. Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram accounted for six deaths each, two deaths each were reported from Alappuzha, Ernakulam, and Kozhikode while Kollam and Kannur reported one death each.

Karnataka on Wednesday reported 9,265 new cases while 75 new deaths were also added to the toll. The day’s positivity rate stood at 8.14%, and Case Fatality Rate touched 0.81%. Bengaluru Urban reported 4,574 cases and 27 of the 75 deaths.

Over a 24-hour period, 1,13,771 tests were conducted including 39,111 rapid antigen tests.

Telangana recorded 1,446 COVID-19 cases on Tuesday.

On October 13, the number of tests stood at 40,056 and 1,446 tested positive. Eight more COVID-19 patients died. The new cases included 252 from Greater Hyderabad, 135 from Rangareddy, 131 from Medchal Malkajgiri, 74 from Karimnagar, and 58 from Nalgonda.

45,2020/10/14,India-Pakistan spar at Commonwealth meet,"Delhi hits back at Islamabad’s charge of “targeting” its religious minorities

India and Pakistan sparred at a Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Ministerial meeting on Wednesday, after Pakistan raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and accused India of “targeting” its religious minorities.

“For a state to hypocritically preach about religious minority groups elsewhere, while trampling upon the rights of its own indigenous minorities, was indeed most regrettable, and a blatant misuse of this august platform,” said Secretary (West) at the Ministry of External Affairs, Vikas Swarup, in response to what he called a “rant” by Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi at the Commonwealth meet, held via videoconference, although he didn’t name Pakistan directly.

In his speech, Mr. Qureshi had also not named India directly but accused “a state” in South Asia of “targeting religious minority groups”. “It has transgressed rights and freedoms of millions and fanned hyper-nationalism to engineer illegal demographic change in a disputed territory,” he said, in an apparent reference to the government’s move to reorganise Jammu and Kashmir and dilute Article 370 in August 2019.

Disputed territory

“The only dispute left in what it alleged today as a ‘disputed territory’ is its own illegal occupation of certain parts, which sooner or later, it would have to vacate,” Mr. Swarup replied, referring to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. He also accused Pakistan of “genocide” during the liberation of Bangladesh and of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations.

The Commonwealth meeting is one of a series of forums where Indian and Pakistani officials have exchanged words in recent months, including during the 8-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Foreign Ministers meeting and the 27-nation Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA), when Pakistan sought to bring bilateral disputes with India into multilateral talks. NSA Ajit Doval also walked out during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation when Pakistan Special Advisor to PM Imran Khan (SAPM) Moeed Yusuf displayed a new map of Pakistan that incorporates more Indian territory in it.

The latest exchange between the two countries comes two days after Mr. Yusuf claimed that India had sent a “message” to Pakistan earlier this year, exploring the possibility of a “conversation”, and set what he called Pakistan’s terms for any bilateral engagement.

“We have got a message for a desire for conversation,” Mr. Moeed Yusuf said in an interview to The Wire news portal but refused to provide further details, saying Pakistan wished to talk to India about Jammu and Kashmir and terrorism.

The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment on Mr. Yusuf’s claim but is expected to issue a full statement in response on Thursday.

No talks have been held between the countries since Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Lahore to meet former Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif in December 2015, and the government has maintained that Pakistan must end cross-border terrorism before talks can be held.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3ae772/article32856416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TH-VIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-pakistan-spar-at-commonwealth-meet/article32856417.ece

He told reporters later that he was not interrogated and was only made to sit and sign on the list of evidence collected from the village on Tuesday

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team probing the gangrape and murder of a Dalit girl in Boolgarhi, Hathras, summoned her two brothers and father to its camp office on Wednesday and questioned them for around seven hours.

The elder brother was taken to the temporary office, created in the office of Deputy Director, Agriculture, Hathras, on Tuesday as well. He told reporters later that he was not interrogated and was only made to sit and sign on the list of evidence collected from the village on Tuesday. He said the evidence included soil from the scene of the crime, ashes and pieces of bones that the family collected from the cremation spot, the slippers of the victim and the cane that the family collected from the site of the cremation.

It could help the investigation agency find out what material was used to cremate the victim.

Interestingly, the cane was still with the family. Brahm Singh, the investigating officer (IO) before the SIT took over the case, said they collected whatever they could find. “You should remember, I was not the first IO in the case,” he said, referring to Ram Shabd who was suspended after the preliminary report of the SIT.

Former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday said the BJP-led government at the Centre was repeating the blunders of the past Congress rulers and was “resorting to the same anti-Punjab and anti-farmer conspiracies” to provoke farmers and youth.

Also read: Farmer leaders walk out of meeting with Agriculture Secretary

“This can have serious consequences for peace in the sensitive border State and for the stability in the country since farmers struggle is a national issue,” said Mr. Badal, accusing the Centre of betraying farmers and their organisations on what he termed as the “so called meeting” in New Delhi on the farm laws.

Mr. Badal said the Prime Minister should have found time to meet farmers instead of sending a faceless bureaucrat to “preach to them”. “If the PM was too busy, the meeting could have been rescheduled. The farmers did the right thing by coming out and refusing to walk into the conspiracy,” he said.

“The Centre has messed up a great opportunity. The opportunity had been created by the farmers’ organisations through their large-hearted and constructive response to the Centre’s invite. But the Centre chose to play games and indulge in doublespeak.”

Mr. Badal demanded that all the farm laws must be scrapped and the farmers organisations be consulted on the way forward. “The farmers’ loss is the loss of the entire nation. The black laws are against not just farmers but also farm labourers, mandi labour, commission agents, small traders and shopkeepers,” he said.

Mr. Badal accused Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh of “acting totally at the behest of the BJP government in trying to sabotage the farmers’ movement. Capt. Amarinder recently sent his Ministers to farmers to mislead them into withdrawing their just struggle and end the road and rail roko,” alleged Mr. Badal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/796bjx/article32855062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUKHBIRSINGHBADALKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-led-central-government-repeating-blunders-of-congress-sukhbir-singh-badal/article32855065.ece
50,2020/10/14,Waning storm may strengthen after crossing Maharashtra coast,"Active monsoon conditions are still prevailing and they give energy to depressions, says IMD Director-General

The sub-cyclonic system or “deep depression” that inundated Telangana and Andhra Pradesh is likely to peter out in a day, but will regain in strength again once it crosses the Maharashtra coast on October 16, according to a weather update from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

October and November are cyclone months with several storms originating in the Bay of Bengal. Most that gain enough energy to become full-fledged cyclones eventually dissipate once they make landfall in a day or so into what are called ‘well-marked lows’. However, it’s rare for a storm that never became a cyclone to manage a crossing across India’s east and west coasts. Moisture from the sea imparts energy to tropical storms and can make them stronger.

“There was a similar situation in 2009,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, Director General, IMD, “But this happens because active monsoon conditions are still prevailing and they give energy to depressions.”

Though the monsoon has officially ended, monsoon-like conditions continue to prevail into October and a full withdrawal was unlikely at least until October 26, he added.

Only storms that whip up wind speeds greater than 62 kmph are classified as cyclones and the current disturbance is hovering over north Karnataka and Maharashtra with wind speeds of 30-40 kmph.

Cyclones Gaja (2018) and Vardah (2016) were both storms that originated in the Bay of Bengal and crossed over all the way into the Arabian sea.

Dr. Mohapatra said that while weather models did indicate the current depression would become a “deep depression” (a notch below a cyclone) and it would happen off the Maharashtra coast, but would not bring cyclonic winds in either Maharasthra or Gujarat, though there would be heavy rains in these States.

“Extremely heavy rains at isolated places would occur over Konkan and Goa, and heavy rains [will occur] in parts of Mahrashtra and south Gujarat beginning Wednesday evening. On the 16th, wind speeds are likely to increase from 40 kmph from Thursday morning and go up to 55 kmph by the evening of Thursday. The seas would be extremely rough and fisherfolk ought not to be venturing out, according to the IMD’s Wednesday bulletin.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ny0ksr/article32770630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ODISHARAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/waning-storm-may-strengthen-after-crossing-maharashtra-coast/article32854292.ece
51,2020/10/14,"Loan borrowers’ Deepavali in your hands, Supreme Court tells government","Court questions need to wait till November 15 to notify compound interest waiver scheme.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned the government’s need to wait a whole month, till November 15, to notify the implementation of a scheme for waiving the compound interest (interest on interest) accumulated during the moratorium against loans worth up to ₹2 crore.

Watch | What does the 3-month moratorium on EMIs mean?

The waiver scheme is meant to “hand-hold small and vulnerable borrowers” whose fortunes have dipped during the lockdown.

“Their Deepavali is in your hands,” the court told the government.

The waiver scheme has been proposed for eight different categories, including MSME, education, housing, consumer durables, credit card, auto, personal and consumption loans.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had termed the Centre’s resolve an “additional relief” for pandemic-induced financial distress among borrowers.

But the court sounded skeptical on Wednesday.

“Having taken the decision to waive their compound interest for the moratorium period, our only question to you is why do you require a month [till November 15] to bring this scheme into effect? Why do you delay issuing the circular?” Justice Ashok Bhushan asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and the RBI.

‘Consider common man’s plight’

Justice M.R. Shah, on the Bench, asked Mr. Mehta to consider the plight of the common man.

“In his mind, the government has already helped him [with the waiver of compound interest]... Now he wants concrete results. When you have already taken a decision, why do you need one month just to issue a circular,” Justice Shah asked.

Mr. Mehta replied that the scheme was itself proof of the government’s concern for the common man. “We have already considered the plight of the common man. That is why we have brought this scheme... We would not gain anything by delaying it. There are complexities involved. November 15 is the outer limit,” he explained.

To this, Justice Shah said the court welcomed the step taken by the government to “take care” of the common man.

Also read: No benefit from RBI’s loan moratorium scheme, says Supreme Court

“We welcome it, but you need to implement it soon”, Justice Shah said.

Mr. Mehta replied that certain “modalities” need to be worked out.

Justice Bhushan observed, “Modalities will take a month? If you had issued a circular to the banks, they would have taken steps... Till now you have not. You have only told the court.”

Mr. Mehta said the government had detailed the scheme on an affidavit in court. It would not go back on its word.

Senior advocate Harish Salve, for the Indian Banks Association, assured the Bench, also comprising Justice R. Subhash Reddy, that the scheme would be “worked out and done”.

He submitted, “It has to be done. Everything the government has said on affidavit has to be done. There is no question about it.” He said a month’s time may be necessary because there were a large number of borrowers under the ₹2 crore category.

Mr. Mehta said the calculation of interest would also vary.

Chidambaram’s plea

Senior advocate P. Chidambaram, appearing for the Shopping Centres Association of India, said the court seemed to want a clear “statement” from the government and the banks.

“Mr. Chidambaram, we don’t want any statement, we want a circular,” Justice Bhushan reacted.

Mr. Chidambaram then said a message had to be then sent from the court.

“Sorry, but a message has already been given by the government [about its intention to help the small borrowers],” Mr. Mehta interjected.

Senior advocate Rajeev Dutta, for petitioner Gajendra Sharma, sought “one line from the Bench to assure the common man”.

But the Bench refrained from passing any formal order. Instead, the court scheduled a hearing for November 2. The Bench said it would evaluate the steps taken by the government then.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cdbplw/article32329094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12BULOAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/loan-borrowers-diwali-is-in-your-hands-sc-tells-govt/article32854140.ece
52,2020/10/14,"As prices rise, Centre to release 1.4 lakh tonnes of pulses from buffer stock","At all-India level, average retail prices of urad have shot up almost 40% in comparison to last year

In a bid to cool down the recent hike in pulses prices, the Union government plans to release 40,000 tonnes of tur dal from its buffer stock into the retail market in small lots. Five States have expressed an interest in buying one lakh tonnes of the dal from the Central buffer stock at MSP (minimum support price) rates to sell at subsidised prices, according to the Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA).

Several major consuming centres of urad (black gram) and tur dal have seen a 20% spike in prices over the last two weeks alone. At an all-India level, the average retail prices of urad have shot up almost 40% in comparison to last year, while the average retail prices of tur dal have increased almost 24%, says an official statement.

Last month, the DoCA introduced a mechanism to use the buffer stock of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED), which procures pulses from farmers at MSP rates, to moderate retail prices by supplying pulses to the States and the Union Territories. The States are supplied pulses either in bulk or in retail packs for supply through the ration shops of the Public Distribution System, or through milk and vegetable outlets run by the government or cooperatives.

“Till date, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Bihar and Tamil Nadu have placed their requirements for tur for a total quantity of over approximately 1,00,000 metric tonnes. More States are expected to come forward in the near future,” said the statement.

For such retail intervention, offer prices are fixed on the basis of MSP itself, or the Dynamic Reserve Price, whichever is lower. Tur is being offered for ₹85 a kg, while urad dal from the 2018 season is being offered at ₹79 a kg and that from the 2019 season for ₹81 a kg. This move will also help clear NAFED’s existing stock to make way for procurement from this season’s harvest, due to arrive in markets soon.

“Apart from this retail intervention, the DoCA has also decided to release 40,000 metric tonnes of tur from the buffer stock in Open Market Sale [OMS] in small lots so that the releases may reach the retail market at a faster pace and help in cooling off rising prices,”the statement stated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nkc9s9/article32851508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16NDSRN01WPI-iGTQ2M4GM23jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/as-prices-rise-centre-to-release-14-lakh-tonnes-of-pulses-from-buffer-stock/article32853962.ece
53,2020/10/14,India provides $1 million for palestinian refugees,"UNRWA has thanked India for its ‘timely help’

India on Wednesday contributed USD one million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agencyto support Palestinian refugees who have been facing extreme challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a move hailed by the UN body as “timely help”.

The Government of India handed over the contribution cheque to the UN agency through its representative in Palestine, Sunil Kumar.

United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has thanked India for its “timely help”.

“India has been a solid and consistent supporter of Palestinian refugees for decades. This contribution is even more significant as it comes at a critical time,” Sami Mshasha, Director of Communications at UNRWA, told PTI.

Also read: India among 20 nations that pledged $100 million to agency for Palestine refugees

“India is facing a difficult situation at home due to the pandemic and it has still not forgotten the Palestinian refugees and stepped in to help stabilise basic services, including education, health care, relief and social services for Palestinian refugees. I would like to thank the Government of India for its continued funding to UNRWA and its backing of Palestine refugees across the Middle East, Mr. Mshasha told PTI.

Reiterating India’s continued support for UNRWA services, Mr. Kumar in a press release said, On behalf of the Government of India, I would like to express my appreciation for the remarkable efforts carried out by UNRWA. India shall continue supporting the Agency’s activities in providing vital services and necessary humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees .

During an Extraordinary Virtual Ministerial Pledging Conference for UNRWA held on June 23 2020, Minister of State for External Affairs, V. Muraleedharan, had announced that India will contribute $10 million to UNRWA over the next two years.

India increased its annual financial contribution to UNRWA from $1.25 million in 2016 to $5 million in 2018 and 2019. It had also contributed $2 million to the agency in May 2020 which brings the total contribution for this year to $three million so far.

“UNRWA has been facing a huge budgetary deficit and with an overwhelming majority of the 5.6 million refugees living under poverty line, the ongoing pandemic has broken the backbone of the basic infrastructure in the area they live. India’s contribution seen in that background is timely and much appreciated,” Mr. Mshasha said.

India has also sent medicines and other supplies to the Palestinian National Authority to help in dealing with the COVID-19 situation.

UNRWA is facing an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty.

It is a United Nations agency established by the General Assembly in 1949 and mandated to provide assistance and protection to some 5.6 million Palestine refugees registered with UNRWA across its five fields of operation.

Its mission is to help Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip achieve their full human development potential, pending a just and lasting solution to their plight.

UNRWA services encompass education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, protection, and microfinance among Palestinian refugees.

Under an India-Palestine development partnership, India is currently funding eight on-going developmental projects worth 59 million US dollars, including building a 215 Bed Super Specialty Hospital in Bethlehem, Information Technology Park, National Printing Press, Turathi-Women Empowerment Project, Diplomatic Training Institute and three schools in various governorates in Palestinian Territories.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fcccco/article32853960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PALESTINIAN-ISRAEL-UN-CONFLICT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-provides-1-million-for-palestinian-refugees/article32853961.ece

Senior Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee on Wednesday said the country’s economy is in “tatters”, and described IMF’s projections of Bangladesh surpassing India in terms of per capita GDP as “our colossal downfall” in pursuit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “5 trillion dream”.

Mr. Abhishek, who is an MP and also president of Trinamool youth congress, posted a news clip on his Twitter handle to take a dig at the Union government.

“Indian Economy in tatters, as even Bangladesh is set to overtake us in Per Capita GDP as per @IMFNews’s World Economic Outlook. Listen carefully, it’s not their resurgence, but our colossal downfall, in pursuit of @narendramodi Ji’s 5 Trillion dream!,” Mr. Abhishek, the nephew of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said.

The PM has set a goal of making India a $5-trillion economy by 2024.

The International Monetary Fund had said on Tuesday said the Indian economy, severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic, is projected to contract by a massive 10.3% this year.

India however, is likely to bounce back with an impressive 8.8% growth rate in 2021, thus regaining the position of the fastest-growing emerging economy, surpassing China’s projected growth rate of 8.25%, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook report.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bkg4fl/article32224357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ABHISHEKBANERJEE-TMC-SUSHANTAPATRONOBISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-economy-in-tatters-colossal-downfall-in-pursuit-of-pm-modis-5-trillion-dream-abhishek-banerjee/article32853833.ece
55,2020/10/14,Cabinet approves school education reform project,"The STARS programme is partly funded by the World Bank.

The Union Cabinet has approved a project partially funded by the World Bank to carry out a reform agenda in the governance of school education, and improve data and assessment systems at the national level, as well as teaching and learning outcomes in six States, especially for early childhood and vocational education.

The project includes an emergency response component to help the government respond to disaster situations which lead to school closures and loss of learning, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, according to an official statement issued after the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

The Strengthening Teaching-Learning and Results for States (STARS) project will have a total project cost of ₹5,718 crore, with the World Bank’s support amounting to about ₹3,700 crore ($500 million), said the statement.

Cabinet meeting updates | October 14, 2020

A major component of the project is the establishment of PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review, and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development) as a National Assessment Centre. Included in the National Education Policy 2020, this autonomous institution under the Union Education Ministry will set norms for student assessment and evaluation for all school boards across the country, most of which currently follow norms set by State governments. It will also guide standardised testing to monitor learning outcomes at the State and national levels, according to the NEP.

The other major initiative at the national level is to strengthen the Education Ministry’s data systems to capture information on the retention, transition and completion rates of students.

At the State level, the project seeks to improve education outcomes and school-to-work transition strategies for better labour market outcomes in Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Odisha.

A similar project to be funded by the Asian Development Bank will cover Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Assam and every State will partner with one other State to share best practices, said the statement.

Education governance reform will be a major focus, with the World Bank’s project document estimating that 83% of the project will be dedicated to the public administration of education. Other areas of focus are assessment systems, teacher development, early childhood, foundational literacy and numeracy, and vocational education, which are all highlighted in the NEP as well.

The World Bank’s latest status report for the project, released earlier this month, also includes plans to include private sector players in the government school system, in “the area of school education governance, management, monitoring, teacher training, school service delivery reform, and overall education service delivery.” This component has raised concerns among some education activists, who have also raised red flags about the emphasis on standardised testing and the use of information and communication technologies in teaching.",,https://www.thehindu.com/education/schools/h6pwk3/article32857272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TH-SCHOOLjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cabinet-approves-new-stars-project-to-strengthen-school-education-system/article32853759.ece
56,2020/10/14,Coronavirus | India to import 1 lakh metric tonne of medical oxygen to meet any shortage during winters,"‘The entire exercise of importing and then distributing the medical oxygen is estimated to cost ₹600-700 crore’

The Union Health Ministry has initiated the process of importing liquid oxygen as part of its preparedness to meet any unforeseen shortage during the winters when the country may witness an increase in COVID-19 cases leading to a rise in demand for oxygen.

HLL Lifecare Limited, a public sector undertaking, has floated a global tender on Wednesday on behalf of the Health Ministry for procuring one lakh metric tonne of liquid oxygen.

The oxygen is being procured for various central and state government hospitals. The entire exercise of importing and then distributing the medical oxygen is estimated to cost ₹600-700 crore, official sources said.

As on Tuesday, around 3.97% of the COVID-19 patients were on oxygen support, 2.46% were in ICU beds which are again with oxygen support and 0.40% on ventilator support.

In March, before the country went into a lockdown, the country had a manufacturing capacity of around 6,400 metric tonne of oxygen per day, of which around 1,000 metric tonne was being used for medical purposes daily while the rest was utilised by industries, sources said.

Also read: Govt permits high-quality containers to move liquid oxygen

“Industries have opened up following unlock procedures and as on September 30, the country’s daily capacity of oxygen production is around 7,000 metric tonne, of which around 3,094 metric tonne is being used for both COVID and non-COVID patients and is just enough to meet the demands,” a source said.

“So this one lakh metric tonne of liquid oxygen which is being planned to be procured from foreign countries would create a one month buffer in case demand rises further during the winter season,” the source explained.

The issue was discussed at a meeting held by the Cabinet Secretary on October 10, following which it was decided to import liquid oxygen.

Even though India is witnessing a declining trend in daily new COVID-19 cases, experts fear that the upcoming festive season and following winter months may see a spike in coronavirus infections.

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has urged people to observe COVID-19-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, maintaining respiratory etiquette and staying away from congregations, citing the possibility of increased novel coronavirus transmission during winters.

“These viruses are known to thrive better in the cold weather and low humidity conditions. In view of these, it would not be wrong to assume that the winter season may see increased rates of transmission of the novel coronavirus in the Indian context too, he said.

In September, when cases were increasing, the Health Ministry had repeatedly advised states to ensure adequate oxygen availability in all healthcare facilities and unrestricted intra as well as inter-state movement of oxygen.

States were also asked to ensure facility wise/hospital wise oxygen inventory management and advance planning for timely replenishment so that there are no stockouts.

A total of 39.43 lakh domestic passengers travelled by air in September this year, 66% lower than the corresponding period last year, the country’s aviation regulator DGCA said on Wednesday.

As many as 21.07 lakh and 28.32 lakh people travelled by air domestically this July and August, respectively, the regulator had said last month.

While IndiGo carried 22.66 lakh passengers in September, a 57.5% share of the total domestic market, SpiceJet flew 5.3 lakh passengers, which is 13.4% share of the total market, according to data shared by the DGCA.

Air India, AirAsia India, Vistara and GoAir carried 3.72 lakh, 2.35 lakh, 2.58 lakh and 2.64 lakh passengers respectively in September, the data showed.

The occupancy rate or load factor of six major Indian airlines was between 57 and 73% in September, it said on Wednesday.

“The passenger load factor in the month of September 2020 has shown some recovery due to increased demand after the opening of lockdown,” said the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

India resumed domestic passenger flights on May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Indian airlines are allowed to operate a maximum of 60% of their pre-COVID-19 domestic flights.

A total of 19.84 lakh passengers travelled domestically in June this year. Between May 25 and May 31, 2.81 lakh air passengers had travelled domestically, the DGCA noted.

The DGCA data mentioned that in September, AirAsia India had the best on-time performance of 98.4% at four metro airports -- Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai.

IndiGo and Vistara were at number two and three at these four airports in September with 98.2% and 95.5% on-time performance, respectively, the regulator said.

The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic.

58,2020/10/14,Punjab farmer leaders walk out of meeting with Agriculture Secretary,"Union Agriculture Minister should have met the delegation, says one of them

A delegation of farmer leaders from Punjab walked out of talks with Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal on Wednesday, tearing up copies of the controversial farm market reform laws in front of Krishi Bhavan, which houses the Agriculture Ministry. They raised slogans slamming the BJP government and calling for the repeal of the laws.

The farmer leaders were angry that they were not granted a meeting with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, or a Group of Ministers (GoM) empowered to negotiate their demand to repeal the laws passed by Parliament last month.

The 29 farm unions driving the widespread protests and rail blockades across the State now plan to meet in Chandigarh on Thursday to discuss their future course of action and how to intensify and broaden the agitation. This is their second rejection this month of the Centre’s efforts to initiate dialogue to end the protests roiling the State.

“We asked the Secretary why we had been called for a meeting in Delhi while the BJP Ministers are busy in Punjab spreading false propaganda about the new laws and telling people that the farmer unions are being misled by other political outfits,” said Krantikari Kisan Union state president Darshan Pal, a member of the delegation.

“The Secretary gave us a speech about how the government is pro-farmer. We asked why the double standards that Union Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Chaudhary is holding virtual meetings in Sangrur and Barnala districts today, but is not available to meet us. Mr. Tomar is also not available to meet. The Secretary is not the person who is empowered to discuss these laws,” he said.

After a one and a half hour meeting, the farmer leaders walked out of Krishi Bhavan, which houses the Agriculture Ministry, and proceeded to tear up the copies of the new laws and shout slogans before returning to Punjab. A meeting of 29 farm unions is planned in Chandigarh on Thursday to discuss future course of action and how to intensify and broaden the protests.

Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar downplayed the walkout when asked about it during a press interaction after a meeting of the Union Cabinet. “Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar have already held talks with many of the unions. If anyone else wants to meet, we are always open to meet everyone. Today, Mr. Tomar had a programme, so he went for that. But whenever free, he will certainly meet them. There is no problem about this,” he told journalists.

The dialogue has failed as the Central government is not serious on the issues of farmers, said Jagjit Singh Dallewal, State president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union-Ekta, who was also part of the delegation. He said the Union Agriculture Minister should have talked to the farmers instead of the Secretary, adding that if Union Ministers are serious about the talks, then they should have talked to the representatives of all the farmers’ groups in Chandigarh itself. Instead, a delegation of Union Ministers is engaged in efforts to mislead the farmers in Punjab, he said.

The delegation also submitted a memorandum to the Secretary detailing their objections to the laws and laying out their demands for a legal guarantee for state procurement at the Minimum Support Prices and the implementation of the Swaminathan Committee recommendations, apart from repeal of the three laws.

Senior Congress leader from Jammu and Kashmir Karan Singh has said that Farooq Abdullah’s recent articulation regarding Article 370 is “totally unacceptable.”

Dr. Singh, the son of the former ruler of J&K, said in a statement that his old friend Mr. Abdullah had made an astounding statement that Article 370 will be restored with China’s support.

“I can understand his rage and frustration at recent events including the fact that he was under house arrest for a year, an emotion that large sections in the Kashmir Valley share. However, his recent articulation is totally unacceptable. It will tend to once again provoke totally unrealistic expectations among the people of Kashmir,” he said.

He said he welcomed the release of Mehbooba Mufti after 14 months in detention and hoped that both leaders would strengthen the democratic process by “taking their agenda to the people once fresh elections take place.”

The Uttar Pradesh government has said it is “committed” to provide “complete security” to the family of the 19-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly raped and murdered in Hathras.

In an affidavit, the State government detailed the security arrangements made for the victim’s family members. It said there will be “no intrusion to the privacy of the victim’s family/witnesses and that they are free to move and meet the people they want”.

Also read: Ground Zero | A long caste feud, a horrific crime, and a sudden cremation

The affidavit came in response to a petition filed by Satyama Dubey, represented by advocates Sanjeev Malhotra and Pradeep Kumar Yadav, seeking a fair probe into the crime.

The State government’s conduct following the crime, including the hasty midnight cremation of the victim in the absence of her family members, caused public uproar.

The Supreme Court had emphasised on the protection of the family and assured them of a fair investigation. The CBI had taken over the probe on a request made by the State.

“The Uttar Pradesh government is committed to provide complete security to the family and witnesses to ensure free and fair investigation,” the affidavit said.

The affidavit said the State had deployed “adequate forces to ensure protection” to the family, which includes the parents, the two brothers, a sister and the grandmother.

61,2020/10/14,"2 militants killed, 2 security men go missing in J&K","SPO Altaf Hussain Bhat was reported missing along with 2 AK-47 rifles: police sources

Two militants were killed in south Kashmir and two security personnel have gone missing along with service rifles from two different locations in central Kashmir’s Budgam on Wednesday.

Police suspect that one of the two missing security personnel may have joined the militant ranks.

Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said, “The two militants were killed during a joint cordon and search operation, launched after a specific input in Shopian's Chakura area”.

He said the identification and affiliation of the killed terrorists was being ascertained. “Incriminating materials including arms and ammunition were recovered from the site of encounter”, the police said.

The last rites of the slain terrorists shall be performed after conducting the medico-legal formalities. “In case any family claims the killed terrorists to be their kith or kin, they can come forward for their identification and participate in the last rites at Handwara”, the police said.

2 security personnel missing

Police sources said Special Police Officer (SPO) Altaf Hussain Bhat was reported missing from his camp along with two AK-47 rifles in Budgam’s Chadoora area.

Preliminary reports suggest the SPO was a resident of Qazipora in Chadoora and was working with the police for the past five years.

“Two AK-47 rifles and three AK-47 magazines were also missing,” the sources said.

In the other incident, a Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) constable has been reported missing from Nagam area of Budgam. The constable, who is from Rajouri, left the camp two days ago.

“The missing of an SPO is of concern. We are trying to locate him and bring him back. We are investigating if the SSB man has gone on an unauthorised leave,” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar told The Hindu.

Army foils infiltration

The Army foiled an infiltration by militants along the Line of Control in Tanghdar Sector of north Kashmir’s Kupwara district.

“A suspicious activity was observed of 3-4 intruders by alert troops on Wednesday morning close to a forward post.

In view of the COVID-19 situation, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued advisories to various ministries and States stressing on aspects of human rights, including protection of rights to mental health of people, officials said on Tuesday.

The NHRC, in a statement, said “deeply concerned” about the rights of the vulnerable and marginalised sections of the society affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdowns, it had constituted a ‘Committee of Experts on Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Human Rights and Future Response’.

The committee included representatives from civil society organisations, independent domain experts and representatives from the concerned ministries and departments. It was tasked to assess the impact of the pandemic on realisation of the rights of the people, especially the marginalised and vulnerable sections of the population which have been “disproportionately impacted”, the statement said.

The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) has rejected a complaint against a Tanishq advertisement for “promoting communal intermingling”, saying there is no violation of any code.

The advertisement in question shows a Muslim woman with her Hindu daughter-in-law celebrating an event together.

The advertisement was withdrawn earlier in the day by the Tata group firm following a furore on social media, even as it received backing from many people.

“The complaint was not upheld, as the advertisement did not violate the ASCI codes of honesty, truthfulness and decency in advertising,” ASCI said in a late evening statement.

The statement from the industry’s self regulatory body came within hours of Tanishq withdrawing the advertisement.

“ASCI has no objection to the airing of this advertisement, should the advertiser choose to do so,” the statement said.

According to ASCI, after the receipt of the complaint, the Consumer Complaints Council, an independent multi-stakeholder panel, reviewed the same.

“This panel was unanimous that nothing in the advertisement was indecent or vulgar or repulsive, which is likely in the light of generally prevailing standards of decency and propriety, to cause grave and widespread offence,” it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/8xziq1/article11453297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tanishq,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/viewer-complains-against-tanishq-ad-for-promoting-communal-intermingling-asci-junks-it/article32850855.ece

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday took a dig at the government over IMF growth projections showing Bangladesh closing in on India in terms of per capita GDP this year and described it as a “solid achievement” of six years of BJP’s “hate-filled cultural nationalism”.

Mr. Gandhi also shared a graph citing its source as the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook report which showed Bangladesh closing in on India and almost catching up with it in terms of per capita GDP this year.

“Solid achievement of 6 years of BJP’s hate-filled cultural nationalism: Bangladesh set to overtake India,” Mr. Gandhi said in a sarcastic tweet accompanied by clapping emojis.

The IMF said on Tuesday that the Indian economy, severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic, is projected to contract by a massive 10.3% this year.

However, India is likely to bounce back with an impressive 8.8% growth rate in 2021, thus regaining the position of the fastest growing emerging economy, surpassing China’s projected growth rate of 8.2%, the IMF said in its latest ‘World Economic Outlook’ report.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cqkzq9/article32850842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAHULGANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/solid-achievement-of-bjps-hate-filled-cultural-nationalism-rahul-on-imf-projections/article32850843.ece
65,2020/10/14,Modified PW engine on GoAir’s Hyderabad-Ahmedabad flight on Sep 19 developed mid-air snag,"One of the modified Pratt and Whitney (PW) engines on GoAir’s Hyderabad-Ahmedabad flight on September 19 developed a technical snag mid-air and was shut down, an aviation industry source said on Tuesday.

The A320neo aircraft, with modified PW engines on both the wings, landed safely at its destination, he added.

The unmodified PW engine-powered A320 neo planes in the IndiGo and GoAir fleets have been facing glitches both mid-air and on-ground since their induction in 2016.

Aviation regulator DGCA had asked the two private carriers on September 15 to fly only those aircraft that have modified PW engines.

“One of the modified engines on GoAir Hyderbad-Ahmedabad G8710 on September 19 shut down mid-air after developing a technical snag. The flight landed safely in Ahmedabad. It is not clear what was the reason for this snag,” the source said.

Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said on September 15 that GoAir had 46 A320neo aircraft and the modified PW engines were installed on 30 of those.

Earlier in the year, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had asked both IndiGo and GoAir to replace the unmodified PW engines by May 30.

It had said the unmodified PW engines contained an “unsafe condition, which is prone to undesirable outcomes” and therefore, need to be dispensed with.

In June, the DGCA extended the deadline due to the coronavirus pandemic and asked the airlines to replace all unmodified PW engines on their planes by August-end.

When contacted, a GoAir spokesperson told PTI, “We would not be able to comment, pending investigation.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/j6hg84/article32368111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRLINES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modified-pw-engine-on-goairs-hyderabad-ahmedabad-flight-on-sep-19-developed-mid-air-snag/article32850679.ece
66,2020/10/14,"Centre mandates all ministries, public depts, CPSUs to use BSNL, MTNL services","The order comes as a relief for the loss making state-run telecom firms.

The central government has mandated all ministries, public departments and public sector units to use telecom services of State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL).

“The government of India has, inter-alia, approved the mandatory utilisation of capacities of BSNL and MTNL by all ministries/departments of government of India, CPSEs, central autonomous bodies,” a memorandum issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said.

The memorandum dated October 12, was issued to all secretaries and departments under the Centre following consultation with the finance ministry.

The Department of Expenditure’s note accompanying the memorandum mentioned that the decision to mandate the use of BSNL and MTNL telecom service was taken by the Cabinet.

“All ministries/departments are accordingly requested to issue necessary instructions including to CPSEs/Central Autonomous organisations under their control for mandatory utilisation of BSNL/MTNL network for internet/ broadband, landline and leased line requirements,” the DoT memorandum said.

The order comes as a relief for the loss making state-run telecom firms who have been losing their wireline subscriber base. BSNL recorded a loss of ₹15,500 crore and MTNL posted a loss of ₹3,694 crore in 2019-20.

BSNL’s wireline subscriber base has eroded from 2.9 crore in November 2008, to around 80 lakh in July this year. MTNL’s fixed line customers have come down from 35.4 lakh in November 2008, to 30.7 lakh in July this year.

State-run telecom firm BSNL has raised more than ₹8,500 crore through sovereign guarantee bonds to expand its network and manage operational expenses. MTNL is yet to raise ₹6,500 crore through sovereign bonds which was approved by the Cabinet in October 2019, as part of its revival package.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cp1v57/article30755709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07BSNL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-mandates-all-ministries-public-depts-cpsus-to-use-bsnl-mtnl-services/article32850372.ece
67,2020/10/14,"U.S. elections 2020 | Indian Americans still strongly identify with Democratic Party, says survey","U.S.-India relations rank low in voter priorities

Results from a new survey of Indian Americans provide strong evidence that contradicts an emerging narrative that these voters are shifting their support from the Democratic Party, which a majority of them have traditionally supported, to the Republican Party. The results also show that U.S.-India relations feature low in the list of issues that motivate voting choice among Indian Americans.

A significant 72%, of registered Indian American voters plan to vote for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the presidential elections while 22% plan to vote for incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump. Three per cent do not plan to vote and 3% plan to vote for a third party candidate, as per the 2020 Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS) published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP), Johns Hopkins SAIS and the University of Pennsylvania. The study surveyed (online) a nationally representative sample of 936 Indian Americans in September and the overall margin of error for the survey is +/- 3.2 % as per the publishers.

Also read: Trump campaign releases commercial for Indian-Americans featuring PM Modi

The narrative (as the report notes) of this shift from the Democratic Party to the GOP, is based on the bonhomie between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as criticisms of the Modi government by Democrat lawmakers (including Mr. Biden’s running mate Kamala Harris). In fact, a recent survey report by AAPI Data and Indiaspora showed that support for the Democrats had fallen a little since 2016. However, this IAAS survey suggests that Indian Americans still strongly identify with the Democratic Party.

“The data really challenge the emerging conventional wisdom that Indian Americans are abandoning the Democratic Party thanks, in part, to concerns over how a Biden-Harris administration might handle relations with India,” said Milan Vaishnav of the CEIP, who co-authored the survey with Sumitra Badrinathan (University of Pennsylvania ) and Devesh Kapur (Johns Hopkins SAIS).

Of the 4.16 million Indian Americans, some 1.9 million are eligible to vote. A survey of their political attitudes is important as the community is being courted by both Democrats and Republicans, in the hope that they can help win battleground states for their respective presidential candidates. These states could, like in 2016, play a decisive role in picking the next President.

Watch | Who is Kamala Harris?

A majority still skew Left, identify as Democrats

Consistent with historical patterns, 56% of Indian Americans generally identify as Democrats and 15% as Republicans. Twenty two per cent identity as independents. In terms of political ideology, the results show that Indian Americans “clearly skew Left.” This Leftward tilt is more visible among U.S. born Indian Americans relative to their foreign-born counterparts.

On a seven point scale that ranged from extremely conservative to extremely liberal, a total of 47% of respondents fell in the extremely liberal, liberal or slightly liberal categories while 23% fell in the slightly conservative, conservative and extremely conservative categories. Twenty nine per cent said they were moderate.

Also read: Is Trump-Modi bonhomie dividing Indian-Americans?

Economy, healthcare more important than India-U.S. relations

Respondents were asked to list the top three issues that influence their vote choice. The biggest issue was the economy (21% said it was their first choice), closely followed by healthcare (20%), then racism (12%) and taxes (9%).

Contrary to the narrative around Indian Americans being driven by India-U.S. relations , the bilateral relationship was second from the bottom with just 3% ranking it as their most important election issue.

“This is not very surprising since the top foreign policy priority of American voters overall appears to emphasise reorienting U.S. foreign policy to more explicitly serve the everyday concerns of Americans and for the United States to be ‘strong at home’,” the survey report says.

Nevertheless, priority issues are also subject to partisan variation. A larger proportion (36%) of likely Indian American voters who are Republicans rank the economy as their number one priority, relative to Democrats (16%). More Democrats (21%) than Republicans (12%) rank healthcare as their top issue.

The survey finds that Indian Americans tend not to identify with the Republican Party because it is perceived as unwelcoming of minorities and “overly influenced by Christian evangelicalism.” Those who identify with the party, primarily do so because they differ with Democrats in economic policy and healthcare policy.

Impact of Kamala Harris

Mr. Biden’s Vice-Presidential candidate choice of Ms. Harris, who has Jamaican and Indian roots, has had a significant “turnout effect” — with 45% of respondents saying the choice made it more likely they would vote in November while 10% said the choice made it less likely they would vote and 40% said it had no impact on their motivation to vote.

The survey data indicate that the mobilisation effect is working in favour of Democrats: 49% say Ms. Harris’s nomination made them more enthusiastic about Mr. Biden’s candidacy while 15% said it made them less enthusiastic about him.

The authors conclude that on balance, the Harris-effect may not impact large numbers of votes because of the underlying tilt towards the Democratic Party.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/w4jsim/article32426782.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bidenkamala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-elections-2020-indian-americans-still-strongly-identify-with-democratic-party-says-survey/article32850303.ece
68,2020/10/14,3 suspected cases of corona reinfection ‘described’ in India: ICMR,"The apex medical research body cites instances of two in Mumbai and one in Ahmedabad

Three cases of suspected coronavirus reinfection — two in Mumbai and one in Ahmedabad — have been “described” in India, the country’s apex medical research body said on Tuesday.

Director General Balram Bhargava said the Indian Council of Medical Research had decided upon a cutoff of 100 days for reinfection if it occurs as, according to some studies, antibodies were also assumed to have a life of four months.

“Reinfection was a problem which was first described via a case from Hong Kong. Subsequently a few cases were described in India — two in Mumbai and one in Ahmedabad,” Mr. Bhargava said at a press conference here.

“We have got some data from the WHO, which says that there are about two dozen reinfection cases in the world at the moment,” he said. “We are looking at the ICMR database and finding out those who have had reinfection and making telephonic contact to get some data out of them.”

The definition of reinfection, whether it is 90 days, 100 days or 110 days, is still not decided even by the World Health Organization, according to Mr. Bhargava.

However, the government is taking the cutoff of about 100 days if reinfection occurs because that is “what we have assumed as the life of antibodies”, the official said. “So it’s work in progress.”

Referring to reports of reinfection surfacing in various states, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had said on Sunday an analysis by the ICMR had revealed that many cases reported as COVID-19 reinfection had been “mis-classified” because the RT-PCR tests could detect dead virus shed for prolonged periods after recovery.

“Actual reinfection would mean a fully-recovered person getting infected by a freshly-introduced virus in his/her body, belonging to the same or different strain. ICMR is commissioning a study to understand the true burden of reinfected cases. Results will be shared in a couple of weeks,” he had said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z2tsz7/article31095169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bhargava-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3-suspected-cases-of-corona-reinfection-described-in-india-icmr/article32849850.ece

70,2020/10/14,Psychology capsule for army personnel serving in Kashmir,"The orientation is based upon four tenets, say officers

Amid increase in the number of local youth joining militancy in the Kashmir valley and focus on dissuading them, the Army’s 15 Corps Battle School (CBS) here has introduced a psychology module in its sensitisation programme for personnel coming to serve in the valley and along the Line of Control (LoC).

“The psychological capsule has been developed in conjunction with the Defence Institute of Psychological Research (DIPR) and is imparted selectively among those undergoing the 28-day orientation programme before induction in the Kashmir valley,” a senior officer at the CBS said. In the general sensitisation capsules too, there is an increasing focus on convincing local youth caught in encounters to surrender.

All soldiers deployed to the valley and the LoC under the 15 Corps area have to undergo a sensitisation programme. All personnel posted to the LoC undergo a 14-day capsule and those deployed in the valley a 28-day capsule.

There are four tenets on which the orientation is based upon — good faith and just conduct, minimum force, avoidance of collateral damage and impartiality and necessity of operations, the officer said. We try to create a cognitive memory here to prepare on various scenarios they might face, another officer at the CBS said. The CBS follows a case study based approach to orient personnel, he said.

A team from the DIPR visited the CBS in 2019 and interacted with the faculty and trainees following which they built the module. The CBS trains 3,000 to 3,200 troops every year in several courses. “Selected lot of 200 to 250 soldiers and officers from the trainees go through the capsule,” the first officer said.

He said the use of drones and youth recruitment among others are the new threats being faced in the valley. To counter youth recruitment, the Army is bringing in families to dissuade them and give up weapons. As per data from the Army, 219 locals joined militancy in 2018, 119 in 2019 and 135 till October 6.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/psychology-capsule-for-army-personnel-serving-in-kashmir/article32848885.ece

After the girl’s death, her family members alleged that she was raped by three men in a forest area on October 8, the officer said.

On the basis of a complaint from the victim’s family members, former village head’s son Kishan Upadhyay and two others -- Ashish and Satish -- were arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the SP said.

The family members alleged that the girl committed suicide as her complaint was not registered, a charge denied by the police, who said the victim’s kin had not given any application to lodge an FIR.

The SP said the post-mortem examination did not confirm rape and the samples would now be sent to a Forensic Sciences Laboratory (FSL).

The girl will be cremated on Wednesday in the village, where elaborate security arrangements have been made.

74,2020/10/14,"TV anchors conducting ‘media trials’, researcher tells SC","Analyst seeks to join case against Sudarshan TV

An application filed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday said an independent study conducted by author and researcher Kota Neelima showed that journalists Arnab Goswami and Navika Kumar are conducting “media trials”.

“Media Trials is another facet of hate speech. Media trials can take place for a variety of reasons, for instance, it can be in order to grab a higher share of Television Rating Points (TRPs) or it can be something more sinister whereby certain private television channels act as proxy propaganda machines for the Central government,” the application, filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes, said.

It has sought the court’s permission to file additional documents.

The application is part of a joint plea made by Ms. Neelima with Sangeeta Tyagi, the widow of Congress national spokesperson Rajeev Tyagi, to intervene in a pending case against Sudarshan TV’s ‘Bindas Bol’ programme, which accused Muslims of “infiltrating” the Civil Services with the help of terror-linked organisations abroad.

“The applicant No. 1 (Ms. Neelima) through ‘Rate the Debate’ (independent research platform) has evaluated the content of the news discussion, and debates undertaken by two renowned journalists i.e. Mr. Arnab Goswami and Ms. Navika Kumar, who have been engaging themselves in conducting ‘media trials’. This includes the detailed analysis of 32 week days’ news content, 55 hours of programming and 76 debate topics conducted by Mr. Arnab Goswami (The Republic) and 24 days of news content, 20 hours of programming and 32 debate topics conducted by Ms. Navika Kumar (Times Now),” the application said.

It said the study showed that “65% of the total debates conducted by Mr. Arnab Goswami from July 31 to September 15 and 69% of the total debates conducted by Ms. Navika Kumar from July 16 to October 6 were on a singular topic, i.e., Sushant Singh Rajput death case”.

It said the statistics, however, do not reveal the complete picture.

“Not only an overwhelming and inordinate amount of time is devoted to a single topic, the manner, tone, tenor and content of the ‘news coverage’ and ‘TV debate’ was highly toxic, polarised and filled with innuendos, salacious gossips, wild allegations and character assassinations,” the application said.

75,2020/10/14,JEE-Advanced candidates who missed exam will get second chance next year,"They will not have to re-qualify by writing JEE-Main 2021, says Joint Admission Board

All candidates who had successfully registered to appear in JEE-Advanced 2020 but were absent for the examination will be allowed to reappear in 2021, as a one-time measure due to COVID-19. They will not have to re-qualify by writing JEE-Main 2021 and will be allowed to directly appear in the JEE-Advanced examination, which is the entrance test for admission to the elite Indian Institutes of Technology.

The decision was taken in an emergency meeting of the IITs’ Joint Admission Board, held virtually on Tuesday, according to a statement issued by IIT Delhi, which was the organising institute for the entrance test this year.

In view of the pandemic, the JAB had considered a relaxation of its eligibility criteria and first decided to permit an extra attempt for those candidates who were unable to appear in JEE-Advanced because they had tested positive for COVID-19. The JAB then discussed various options for candidates who were prevented from appearing in the examination due to restrictions imposed because of the pandemic.

“Subsequently, to address the concerns of the affected candidates, while avoiding prejudice to other candidates, it has been decided to allow all the candidates, who had successfully registered to appear in JEE (Advanced) 2020 but were absent in the exam, to appear in JEE (Advanced) 2021, as a one-time measure,” said the statement.

Equal opportunity

It added that in order “to ensure equal opportunity to all,” these candidates will not have to re-write the JEE-Main which is the first stage qualifying examination, but will instead be allowed to directly appear in JEE-Advanced, on the basis of their successful qualification and registration this year.

No such second chance has been announced for students who could not appear for JEE-Main itself, which is conducted by the National Testing Agency, and not the IITs, although more than a quarter of registered students failed to turn up to write that examination.

76,2020/10/14,Shahjahanpur law student turns hostile,"The woman says she never accused Chinmayanand of sexual abuse, faces perjury charge

In a courtroom twist to the high-profile case on Tuesday, a law student who had accused former Union Minister Chinmayanand of sexually exploiting her disowned her statements to police and now faces a perjury charge.

Appearing before an MP-MLA court in Lucknow, the LLM student categorically denied that she had levelled any allegation against the former Union Minister as the prosecution had charged.

At this, the prosecution immediately moved an application under Section 340 of the CrPC, seeking action against her for perjury.

Judge P.K. Rai directed his office to register the application and asked the prosecution to furnish a copy of the application to the victim and the accused.

The court fixed October 15 for hearing on the application.

The Allahabad High Court in February this year granted bail to Chinmayanand, whose trust runs the Shahjahanpur law college where the woman studied. He was arrested in September last year.

The case was registered under Section 376-C of the IPC, an offence pertaining to the abuse of one’s position by a person in authority to “induce or seduce” a woman under his charge to have “sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape.”

Chinmayanand (72) also faced charges under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 354-D (stalking) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

According to government lawyer Abhay Tripathi, the victim had lodged an FIR in this regard with the Lodhi Colony police station of New Delhi on September 5, 2019.

Her father lodged another complaint in Shahjahanpur and both FIRs were merged.

An SIT had recorded her statement. Later, her statement under Section 164 of the CrPC was recorded in Shahjahanpur.

In both statements, she had supported the FIR version but now during the trial, she changed her statement and denied the facts mentioned in the complaint.

“Since she has turned hostile, I have moved an application under Section 340 of the CrPC,” Mr. Tripathi said.

Earlier, the investigation officer had cited 33 witnesses and 29 documentary evidence in the 13-page chargesheet.

The Allahabad High Court had on February 3, 2020 transferred the trial from Shahjahanpur to the Lucknow’s MP-MLA court.

The case first came to light after the woman went missing on August 24, a day after she posted a video on social media alleging that a “senior leader of the sant community” was harassing and threatening to kill her.

Her father filed a complaint with police, accusing Chinmayanand of sexually harassing her, a charge refuted by the former Union Minister’s lawyer who claimed it was a “conspiracy” to blackmail him.

An SIT was constituted by the Uttar Pradesh government on the orders of the Supreme Court in September to investigate the charges levelled by the woman.

The law student was also later charged with trying to extort money from Chinmayanand. The 23-year-old woman and her three friends were booked on Chinmayanand’s complaint that they had demanded ₹ 5 crore from him.

The former Union Minister alleged that they had threatened to make public video clips that showed him getting massages from the student. She was, however, granted bail in December.

The Supreme Court had last week set aside an Allahabad High Court order allowing Chinmayanand to get a copy of statement of the woman recorded before a magistrate in connection with the case against him, saying “utmost confidentiality is required to be maintained” in sexual exploitation cases.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yxkv5o/article31058824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWAMICHINMAYANAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shahjahanpur-law-student-turns-hostile/article32848721.ece
77,2020/10/14,"Odisha seizes a record 1,054 quintals of marijuana this year","Efforts are on to stop illegal cultivation in accessible and forested regions, says DGP

The Odisha police on Tuesday claimed massive success in tracking the movement of cannabis consignments by seizing more than 1,000 quintals of the illicit substance this year.

The Special Task Force, the Crime Branch of Police and the district police personnel have together seized 1,054 quintals of weed by September 30.

“The average annual seizure of ganja during the past 10 years has been 312 quintals. If we take the average of the past five years,it would go up to 414 quintals. However, our law enforcement agencies have managed to confiscate 1,054 quintals of cannabis — 2.5 times of average annual seizure of the last five years,” said DGP Abhay at a press conference in Cuttack.

In 2018, the State police had seized 523.89 quintals of marijuana and the seizure had gone up to 618.15 quintals next year.

Mr. Abhay said the Koraput district had led in ganja seizure by confiscating 413 quintals this year followed by 240 quintals by Malkanagiri and 126 quintals by Gajapati district. The SPs of these districts have been appreciated for their efforts.

“Apart from the seizure of ganja, we have intensified financial investigation with a focus on unravelling conspiracy and detecting the brain behind the cultivation and evacuation of cannabis,” he said.

The DGP said Odisha is a marijuana-producing State and efforts are on to stop illegal cultivation in accessible and forested regions. An action plan was finalised at a recent high-level meeting attended by the Excise Secretary and the Addl. DGP (Crime Branch).

At a virtual meeting of the DGPs of Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh on Monday, it was decided to designate a nodal officer by every State for better coordination in handling drug cases and sharing information.

Mr. Abhay, who was earlier Director General of Narcotics Control Bureau, said, “The system of mapping poppy cultivation through satellite imagery has already been stabilised. Since the NCB has been using the system for the past 10 years, accurate information is made available. A similar system has been developed for cannabis cultivation with the help of Indian Space Research Organisation. Within the next couple of years, we hope to have information of areas of its cultivation.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/odisha-seizes-a-record-1054-quintals-of-marijuana-this-year/article32848567.ece

Minister for Agriculture K. Kannababu said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has taken decision on three capitals after recommendations submitted from committees.

He also reiterated that the State government was not neglecting Amaravati at all and would develop it.

Speaking to the media here on Tuesday, he alleged that TDP leader N. Chandrababu Naidu had not shown even one per cent of love on Visakhapatnam, which he showers on Amaravati. Mr. Kannababu questioned that if Mr. Naidu really had love for Amaravati, why did he not conduct any summit or important meetings in Amaravati.

He also said that the CPI leaders are speaking what Mr. Naidu is instructing them to do.

He questioned why the CPI did not form an alliance with TDP for the elections.

Minister for Tourism M. Srinivasa Rao said that as part of decentralised development, all areas of the State, including Amaravati, will be developed.

It is Mr Naidu alone, who wants Amaravati as the only capital for the State, he said.

95,2020/10/14,Govt. revokes permit for granite mining at Kalyanapulova reservoir,"Tribal farmers have been opposing such activities in reserve forest area

The government has revoked the permit accorded to Stone Plus company for mining granite from the reserve forest and the catchment area of the Kalyanapulova reservoir in Visakhapatnam district.

The decision was taken in response to the demands of tribal people and farmers of Cheemalapadu village in Ravikamatam mandal, announced Joint Collector Venugopal Reddy late on Monday night. The tribal people and the farmers have been agitating since months, demanding the revocation of the mining permit, alleging that it was causing damage to the reserve forest and the catchment area of the reservoir.

Tribal people, farmers and the members of All India Agricultural Rural Labour Association (AIARLA) and Save Kalyanapulova Movement urged the government to revoke the licence issued to Sai Kapil company too, saying that the mining area adjoins the primary school at Z. Jogumpeta village, which also falls in the catchment area.

“Both the mining companies have been mining granites from the hills adjoining the reservoir catchment area that has been declared a reserve forest by the Forest Department,” said P.S. Ajay Kumar of the AIARLA.

‘Drop cases against tribals’

He demanded that the reservoir area be declared as a ‘no mining zones’ and cases registered by the Kotakotha police against the tribal people of Kalyanapulova, who took up the agitation, be dropped.

Officials blamed

“Criminal cases should be registered against the officers of the land survey and land records department who allegedly created fake revenue survey numbers in Somalamma Konda hill to mislead the administration,” said Mr. Ajay Kumar.

Foundation stone for Kalyanapulova reservoir was laid some 40 years ago and it has been catering to the irrigation needs of the farmers from 10 panchayatas in Ravikamatham mandal, covering over 5,000 acres.

Irrigation source

Mining permits have been issued in the reservoir catchment area since 2016, and farmers and tribal people have been sending petitions to the irrigation and mining departments, seeking cancellation of the leases from 2017.

Stone Plus company has been mining granite from the reserve forest areas of Somalamma Hill and dumping the waste along the hillsides.

In May this year, the Forest Department halted the mining activities and confiscated the machinery and the granite mined from the area.

The tribal people opposed when the mining company tried to move the confiscated material last month, without obtaining the required permits.

Criminal cases were registered against tribal people who objected to it. However, they continued the agitation. The authorities concerned took note of it and the mining leases were revoked after an inquiry, added Mr. Ajay Kumar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lo7914/article32848604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14ONG4KALYANALOVARESERVOIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-revokes-permit-for-granite-mining-at-kalyanapulova-reservoir/article32848605.ece
96,2020/10/14,Rain to help ease drought-like situation in Srikakulam district,"16 of the total 38 mandals record deficit precipitation up to 40%

The heavy downpour under the influence of depression, which lashed Vizianagaram and Srikakualm districts disrupted the normal life temporarily for sure, but it has brought the much needed relief to the region which recorded a rainfall deficit during the monsoon season.

The deficit rainfall in the last three months has created a drought like situation in 16 of the total 38 mandals in Srikakulam district. Despite the heavy rains, the district is still under the deficit rainfall category.

The district has received rainfall of 604 mm when compared to the normal of 705 mm, recording a nearly 22% deficit. Paddy, maize and other crops were badly damaged owing to the lack of rains during the crucial period.

However, the recent rainfall is expected to help paddy crop though maize crop was damaged a little.

Amadalavalasa, Burja, Gara, Narasannapeta, Laveru, G. Sigadam and other mandals recorded a rainfall deficit of 40 % even after the downpour in the last three days.

Heavy inflows

The Nagavali, Vamsadhara and other rivers whose streams were reduced considerably owing to the lack of rain between June and September received significant inflows on Tuesday. The Vamsadhara received 8,997 cusecs of water and the irrigation officials released the excess water from the barrage in anticipation of more inflows from the catchment areas of Odisha.

Srikakulam Collector J. Nivas asked the irrigation and revenue officials to monitor the situation cautiously as rain continues to lash the catchment areas in Odisha.

Roads damaged

Meanwhile, the heavy downpour caused flash floods in the Champavati river and Upputeru in Pusapatirega mandal of Vizianagaram district. Road communication to several villages including Konda, Tippalavalasa and others was snapped in the early hours of Tuesday. However, the situation improved with the receding of water from the paddy fields nearby.

The revenue officials visited the affected villages in boats. They informed Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal that the situation was under control and all the residents were safe.

99,2020/10/14,Bangladeshi ship runs aground at Visakhapatnam beach,"The 3,000-tonne vessel came to the city port to load fly ash cargo

A 3,000-tonne Bangladeshi cargo vessel, MV Maa, drifted from its anchorage point and ran aground near Tenneti Park in Visakhapatnam, in the wee hours of Tuesday.

The empty ship which came to Visakhapatnam Port to load fly ash cargo had been waiting near the anchorage point since September 19 for the berthing itinerary.

As per the initial findings by the authorities of Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) , the ship had one functioning anchor, which was not informed to the port officials. Every ship is built with at least two anchors on each side of the bow. Due to the heavy swell owing to the deep depression over the Bay of Bengal, the sea had been very rough for the last two days which made the ship lose its only anchor.

The wind speed also touched the 65 km per hour mark on Tuesday. As the wind was very strong, the 80-metre-long ship with about 15 crew members on board drifted towards the shore and ran aground near Tenneti Park on the northern edge of the port limits.

It is learnt that around 11.45 p.m., the master of the ship sought tug assistance from the VPT authorities as the vessel was drifting towards the shore. By by the time, the tug could reach the ship, it already ran aground.

Damage assessment

The VPT authorities said the Protection and Indemnity authorities had been informed and an initial damage assessment would be made. Based on the assessment, it will be decided whether or not the ship could be towed out.

A team from the Director General of Shipping will assess how the ship drifted.

Experts and former captains feel that the engine of the ship might have failed, as they say that the master of the ship would have manoeuvred the ship to safety, if the engine was alive.

The port authorities said all ships waiting in the anchorage were informed about the bad weather and advised either to sail out into the deep sea or come inside the port. But, the MV Maa vessel chose to stay put at the anchorage point.

The port authorities have informed the police, Coast Guard, shipping agents for the ship and other authorities concerned for necessary action.

No oil spill

Preliminary investigation suggest that no damage was done to the ballast tank of the vessel and it is still in stable position. But, it may take time to pull it out as the area is said to be dotted with huge rocks. It is learnt that the ship master is confident that the ship can be towed out by two or three tugs, if the tide is high.

After a coordinated rescue effort by the Coast Guard and the VPT, the officials confirmed that there was no oil spill and efforts were on to drain out 40 tonnes of diesel the ship is carrying.

“As of now, there is no danger of marine pollution. Once the oil is removed, efforts will be made to tow out the ship. We wanted to disembark the crew, but the ship master insisted that they would like to stay on board as the ship is in stable condition,” said Coast Guard DIG B. Ranjan.

A Chinese ship ran aground near the RK Beach in 2005. As the news spread, thousands of people rushed to the spot to see the ship and many were seen clicking pictures with cellphones and professional cameras.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ia3e7b/article32848514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14ONG4VESSEL2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bangladeshi-ship-runs-aground-at-visakhapatnam-beach/article32848515.ece
100,2020/10/14,Kisan Rail freight to be subsidised by 50%,"Railways converts train into a time-tabled service for the benefit of farmers

The Ministry of Food Processing Industries will bear 50% of the freight charges if farmers send their produce via Kisan Rail. A decision to this effect was taken by Secretary Pushpa Subramanyam on a representation given by Anantapur MP Talari Rangaiah.

At a press conference here on Tuesday, the MP also announced that the Railway Board had turned the Kisan Rail into a Weekly Time-Tabled train between Anantapur and Adarsh Nagar in Delhi. The major advantage of converting the train into a regular time-tabled train will be the booking of part consignments in a 23-tonne bogie.

Initially, the train will leave Anantapur on Saturday night so that by Monday afternoon, the fruits reach Delhi when the markets are open. The normal freight from Anantapur to Adarsh Nagar is ₹5,136 per tonne, which will be now charged at ₹2,568 per tonne. This scheme is being run as a pilot project for six months with a promise to extend it further if needed.

The Food Processing Industry has initially set aside ₹2.9 crore as subsidy for such transport of agriculture and horticulture goods through this train, and as and when the Railways sends the bills, it would be automatically transferred to their account from this fund. “If a further amount is needed, it will also be sanctioned by the Food Processing Industries Ministry,” Mr. Rangaiah added.

Collector Gandham Chandrudu, who was present on the occasion, said the next train is likely to be sent on October 17 from Anantapur railway station. A passenger bogie is also attached to the Kisan Train so that farmers or their representatives can buy a ticket for ₹800 and travel along with the produce to the mandi.

Anantapur Urban MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy, appreciating the role of the Horticulture Department and District Collector in making the Kisan Rail a success, said that the services of the Agriculture Marketing Department would also be utilised to make this facility reach more farmers.

Sources in the department said compilation of the data was imperative for clarity to emerge. A G.O. is expected to be released soon that will end all confusions, said an official.

New specifications

This academic calendar, being released after postponing it thrice in the past due to the uncertainly on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, has certain new specifications partly on account of lockdown and also as part of educational reforms in line with the new National Education Policy.

108,2020/10/14,Five hunters arrested with sophisticated weapons,"They had telescopic guns, pistol, archery set, and fishing kit

The Chitradurga forest officials have arrested five people, including a minor, who were set to hunt wild animals armed with sophisticated weapons in Gowdanahalli Reserve Forest in Hiriyur taluk.

The officers, working on a tip-off, took into custody Ikshu Dhanva, 50, of Shivamogga, Pratap, 42, Vinod, 38, Vasudeva Shetty, 42 of Bengaluru, and a minor, on October 11. Ikshu Dhanva is a son of the late Prafulla Chandra, noted progressive farmer of Shivamogga. The minor has been sent to juvenile custody. Others are in judicial custody. Two more people are absconding.

The officers were stunned when they got to know that the team had telescopic guns, a pistol, archery set, fishing kit, and knives among others. The weapons and three vehicles belonging to the arrested were also seized.

K. Chandrashekhar Nayak, Deputy Conservator of Forests of Chitradurga, told The Hindu: “It seems they were all prepared to go on a hunting expedition when our team reached the spot. They all had highly sophisticated imported weapons. We have registered a case under the Wildlife Protection Act.”

The officers suspect that the team must have visited the place in the past to hunt wild boars. It is said they had hired a farmhouse near the forest area to stay during their visit to the place. One among the absconding is a resident of Hiriyur taluk, who provided them with shelter.

“The arrested are right now in judicial custody. We will seek their custody so that we can collect further information from them. Our team did not find animal carcass from them. It seems they visited the place earlier for hunting expeditions,” the DCF said. The officer said the case about possession of arms would be handed over to the police.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5lz539/article32856613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGWEAPONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/five-hunters-arrested-with-sophisticated-weapons/article32856614.ece
109,2020/10/14,"Ahead of Dasara, Mysuru has most number of active cases","Analysis carried out by Jeevan Raksha does not include Bengaluru Urban

Ahead of the 10-day Dasara festival scheduled to start from October 17, Mysuru tops the district-wise chart on the number of active COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population in Karnataka.

Bengaluru, however, was not part of the analysis carried out by Jeevan Raksha, an initiative of Proxima, a management consulting firm, with the support of Public Health Foundation of India and Indian Medical Association.

As on October 10, exactly a week before Dasara festivities, the number of active cases per million population stood at 2,449 and the deaths per million population stood at 292. In comparison, the number of active cases and deaths per million across the State (excluding Bengaluru Urban) stood at 1,088 and 128, respectively.

In terms of active cases per million population, Mysuru was closely followed by Hassan with 2,408 and Bengaluru Rural with 2,306 cases. Dakshina Kannada and Dharwad came a close second and third in terms of deaths per million population with 287 and 280.

Though the State government has curtailed the Dasara celebrations by cancelling most of the events and imposing severe restrictions on the gathering even for the few programmes that are being held, Mysuru is considered to be one of the COVID-19 hotspots in the State with the district figuring in the third position in terms of positive cases per million population. With 13,836 positive cases per million population on October 10, Mysuru is next only to Udupi (16,328) and Ballari (13,946).

Also, the number of positive cases in Mysuru had increased from 25,086 on September 12 to 41,523 on October 10, which accounted for a moving growth rate of 66% against 50% in the rest of the State.

Similarly, the number of persons who had died due to COVID-19 in Mysuru had risen from 576 on September 12 to 875 on October 10, indicating a moving growth rate of 52% compared to 38% for the rest of the State.

Medical infrastructure

In view of the COVID-19 projections, convener of Jeevan Raksha Mysore Sanjeev pointed out to the demand for medical infrastructure that the rising number of cases will bring.

“When the number of positive cases go up, leading to more active cases, the mortality will also go up in the absence of medical infrastructure to meet critical cases,” he said. Along improving the medical infrastructure, Mr. Sanjeev said there should be effective containment management by deploying enough manpower to “trace, test and isolate.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vxrxd6/article32856592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGCOVIDMYS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ahead-of-dasara-mysuru-has-most-number-of-active-cases/article32856594.ece
110,2020/10/14,Residential dementia care centre on NIMHANS Sakalavara campus soon,"It will provide care to patients and train caregivers, mental health professionals

A first of its kind government-run residential dementia care centre will soon come up on the Sakalavara Community Mental Health Centre campus of NIMHANS.

While the centre will be constructed with financial assistance from REC Foundation, the CSR arm of Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd., New Delhi, C.R. Chandrasekhar, former Professor of Psychiatry at NIMHANS and founder of Samadhana Counselling Centre in Bengaluru, has contributed ₹1 crore towards the operational expenditure of the centre. The project was launched on Wednesday.

Dr. Chandrashekar said he has made the donation in memory of his wife the late D.S. Rajeshwari Chandrashekar. “More philanthropists apart from the State and Central governments should come forward and donate funds for running the centre. As this is the only government residential care centre for dementia, it will benefit those from the underprivileged section of society,” he said.

P.T. Sivakumar, Professor of Psychiatry and Consultant in Geriatric Psychiatry Unit in the Department of Psychiatry at NIMHANS, said there is a need for residential care in at least 33% of patients with dementia. “However, less than 1% are able to afford and access residential care as there are hardly 20 dedicated dementia care centres in the country. All of them are private facilities or those run by NGOs,” he said.

In the first phase, the centre will have 40 beds. This will later be upgraded to a 100-bed facility. The centre will not just provide care to patients but will also train caregivers and mental health professionals in dementia care. “Training of family and professional caregivers for dementia care is also important. There is a need to develop a complete range of care systems that are affordable and accessible for those with limited economic capacity on priority,” he said.

Once operational, the centre will also provide hands-on training to those doing various geriatric mental health care courses and fellowship programmes at NIMHANS.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7fvg4m/article32856579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGSAKALAVARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/residential-dementia-care-centre-on-nimhans-sakalavara-campus-soon/article32856580.ece

112,2020/10/14,Multiplexes set to welcome movie buffs with PPE kits,"Large multiplexes are leaving no stone unturned to tempt movie buffs back to the big screen. Some of the elaborate arrangements include distributing PPE kits and disposable 3D glasses.

While the choice of protective gear has raised eyebrows with many arguing that PPE kits should be reserved for doctors, nurses and those at the frontline fighting COVID-19, citizens themselves are unsure of whether they would like to watch a film masked and gowned.

Both the Union and State governments have permitted cinemas to resume operations from October 15 onwards, with 50% seating capacity.

Multiplexes, including INOX and PVR, are making PPE kits available at counters for customers, who will have to shell out extra for them. “Wearing of PPE kits is optional. We have also put in place amenities to ensure that the kits are safely disposed of once used,” said one multiplex owner.

Safety measures

Other measures put in place include sanitising of seats after every show and daily mandatory health screening for all employees who will be in protective gear. To avoid crowding, staggered and different entry and exits, extended interval time, QR code and mobile-based food ordering system, dedicated food ordering and pick-up counters, contactless payment system and encouraged online bookings have been put in place.

A senior representative from INOX said that they will resume screenings at Lido Mall and Brookfield Mall from Thursday. Other INOX screens will gradually resume within the next 10 days. PVR Cinemas will have “goodwill screenings” for company employees, health workers, police force and others on Thursday, and will open to the public from Friday.

Arun Kumar B.S., owner of Santosh Theatre and past president of Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI), said that positive experiences from cinema goers will be the game changer. Santosh theatre is all set to resume operations from Friday with the screening of the late Chiranjeevi Sarja starrer Shivarjuna. “All the precautionary measures, according to government guidelines, are in place. We are trying our best to provide a safe movie watching experience,” Mr. Kumar said.

Uday Garudachar, owner of Garuda Mall chain, said elaborate arrangements have been made to welcome customers. “With this, we are expecting business to pick up by Dasara and Deepavali, after which we will have Christmas and New Year. Let us hope that by that time, COVID-19 subsides,” he added.

Govt. issues SOP

The State Government on Wednesday issued an SOP for resuming screening of movies. It has asked cinema halls to maintain humidity range from 40-70% with temperature setting of all the air conditioning devices from 24-30 degrees Celsius. “Recirculation of air must be avoided to the extent possible and cross ventilation should be adequate,” the SOP read.

According to the SOP, only packaged food and beverages should be allowed inside the cinema hall. To avoid crowding at the ticket counters, the SOP has asked the ticket counters to be opened throughout the day though online transactions should be the most preferred mode.

Providing phone numbers while buying or booking tickets has been made mandatory.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/g3zj7f/article32856569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGINOX,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/multiplexes-set-to-welcome-movie-buffs-with-ppe-kits/article32856570.ece
113,2020/10/14,"Man kills toddler, born out of wedlock, to protect career","With a plan to contest GP polls, he thought revelation about his affair and child would spoil his image

A man allegedly murdered his two-year-and-eight-month-old baby born out of an extramarital affair to avoid tarnishing his political image in Chitradurga district. The police arrested the accused and exhumed the baby’s body at Guttidurga in Jagalur taluk on Tuesday.

Ningappa, 33, a resident of Guttidurga, was in a relationship with Shashikala. He had three children from his first marriage and a baby girl from his relationship with Shashikala. Neither her parents nor his family was aware of the affair and the baby.

As Shashikala’s parents put pressure on her to get married, she forced Ningappa to accept her as his wife in the presence of relatives so that everybody would know about their relationship. However, Ningappa was not ready for it. With a plan to contest in the gram panchayat elections, he thought any revelation about his affair and the child would spoil his political career.

Chitradurga SP G. Radhika told The Hindu that over the last few days, Ningappa convinced Shashikala to get separated, assuring her that he would hand over the baby to an orphanage. Though Shashikala was reluctant initially, she consented later. On September 7, the accused took the baby and asked Shashikala to return to her native place. A week later, she called him to enquire about the baby. He repeatedly misled her about the baby’s whereabouts. Eventually, he told her that he had killed the baby.

“Shashikala filed a complaint with the Women’s Police Station in Chitradurga on October 9. Later, the police took Ningappa into custody. He admitted to have strangulated and smothered the baby before burying her in his farm,” the officer said. The police exhumed the body and took samples for a DNA test. The SP said the accused wanted to get rid of the relationship ahead of the GP elections. Ningappa had been in a relationship with Shashikala even before his marriage. Both were from the same caste and wanted to get married. However, they faced opposition from elders in the families as both belonged to the same sub-sect within the case and it would mean they are brother and sister, as per the community’s understanding. The accused was worried that if his relationship was made known to people of his community, they would not stand by him in the election.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/man-kills-toddler-born-out-of-wedlock-to-protect-career/article32856543.ece
114,2020/10/14,Schools experiment with format for midterm exam,"Multiple-choice questions and testing analytical skills being given more weightage

Many private schools in the State, which have midterm examinations online, have tweaked the testing pattern this academic year. Some, for instance, have included multiple-choice questions, while others are changing the objective of the assessment.

Rather than testing students’ knowledge across the length and breadth of chapters, more emphasis will be on if students have understood core concepts.

Manju Balasubramaniam, principal of Delhi Public School, Bengaluru North, said the aim of the examination is to understand where children stand after months of online teaching and learning. “We want to use the examination as a diagnostic tool to figure out where students are going wrong, so that remedial classes can be held,” she said.

Dakshayani Kanna, principal of Harvest International School, Bengaluru, said they have introduced analytical questions that are open book. Students can refer to any notes to answer them. “More weightage, around 40 marks, has been given for multiple-choice questions and less emphasis on essay-type questions. We have allotted 20 marks for internal assessment and 20 for questions that require students to answer in the essay format,” she said. In the past, multiple-choice questions were allotted only 20 marks, while essay questions collected 60 marks.

DPS Bengaluru North is following an objective assessment for primary school students, while high school students have 60% objective and 40% summative questions.

No clarity yet

Initially, many schools considered doing away with the midterm assessment, but decided to go ahead with it as they were yet to get clarity on how their respective boards are planning to assess students for the 2020-2021 academic year.

For the most part, parents have approved the altered formats. Monica S., whose daughter is in class five, said: “Conducting assessments as rigorously as the previous year would be unfair on the students. We want the respective boards to declare the 2020-2021 academic year as a zero-examination year.”

However, some schools have stuck to traditional formats. B. Gayatri Devi, principal of Little Flower Public School, said they have regular assessments so that high school students are better prepared for the board examination.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/schools-experiment-with-format-for-midterm-exam/article32856502.ece
115,2020/10/14,SWM rules: KSPCB pulled up for not prosecuting officials,"The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday deplored the failure of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to prosecute public servants for not implementing the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, framed under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi said that the Board had not set criminal law into motion for failure of the officials to enforce rules governing the handling and disposing of municipal solid waste for the last 20 years. The Bench directed the Board’s member-secretary to file an affidavit explaining the reasons for the failure of the Board in prosecuting the officials of the local authorities for their failure.

The order was passed during the hearing of a batch of PIL petitions related to failure of municipal authorities and the government to dispose municipal solid waste as per the norms.

While terming the conduct of the KSPCB as shocking, the Bench said the Board appears to not be aware of the notification, issued several years ago by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change under Section 19 of the Environment Protection Act authorising designated officers to launch prosecution.

Neither the Board nor the State government are bothered about the implementation of the SWM Rules by the local authorities though many of them are illegally dumping waste in an unscientific manner and contrary to the manner prescribed in the SWM Rules, the Bench observed.

But for intervention of the court, city corporations like the BBMP would not have even bothered to take steps for implementation of the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, which has been replaced by SWM Rules, 2016.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/swm-rules-kspcb-pulled-up-for-not-prosecuting-officials/article32856497.ece

120,2020/10/14,"Ahead of Dasara, Mysuru sees more discharges than active cases","Number of discharges cross 35,000-mark; fatalities too are seeing a drop in last two days

For the first time after a long pause, Mysuru, the State’s second COVID-19 hotspot after Bengaluru, is seeing more discharges than active cases, bringing a brief succour to the people fighting the pandemic for many months.

After an alarming spike, driving the frontline healthcare workers into a combat mode to contain the spread, the number of discharges are surpassing the number of active cases. And, in even a bigger relief, the fatalities – second highest after Bengaluru - too have seen a drop in the last two days.

On Tuesday, the number of discharges crossed the 35,000-mark, thanks to remarkable improvement in patients’ recovery, increasing the discharge rate. As on Tuesday, 35,050 infected patients had been discharged in Mysuru.

The active cases were 416 but the discharges were 693 on Tuesday. On Monday, the active cases were 309 and the discharges were 728. Barring Sunday which saw more active cases – 541 active cases and 331 discharges, the active cases dropped again on Saturday with 569 patients discharged amidst 465 active cases.

The fatalities in Mysuru were a larger concern for the administration since the mortality rate was 3.9 per cent (for a brief period), which was higher than the global COVID-19 death rate. Minister for Medical Education and Health K. Sudhakar had said here recently that Mysuru was once a model for COVID-19 management in the State but is now registering a mortality rate at 1.9 per cent whereas the national mortality rate was at 1.6 per cent, State at 1.5 per cent besides the global death rate at 3.5 per cent.

In Mysuru, three deaths were reported on Tuesday and seven on Monday. Eleven and 13 deaths were reported on Sunday and Saturday respectively. The government’s primary aim is to bring down the death rate to less than one per cent. The total number of deaths in Mysuru was 896.

In terms of disease burden and fatality, Mysuru comes next after Bengaluru, according to M.K. Sudarshan, chairman, COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, Bengaluru. In his recent report, he had said that the COVID-19 fatality rate in Mysuru was 2.1 per cent and test positivity rate is 17 per cent (as on October 8).

Taking up the challenge of reigning in the pandemic, Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, who took charge recently, immediately ramped up the testing, achieving more than 100 per cent test target. Last Wednesday, 124 per cent testing was achieved in Mysuru, the highest since a long time. Special testing teams had been constituted and many officers had been posted here as well as in various places in the district for coordination and successful testing. Mysuru has now been divided into four zones for COVID-19 management and senior officers are monitoring the situation with the help of field teams.

As against the target, 45 per cent testing was done in September in Mysuru, asserting that Mysuru was in immediate need of carrying out more testing considering the positivity rate, and containing the spread of the infection in the community.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uf5jv6/article32855021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MYSMASK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ahead-of-dasara-mysuru-sees-more-discharges-than-active-cases/article32854359.ece

Ahead of the start of Dasara celebrations, the Mysuru district administration has issued orders banning entry of general public to Chamundi Hills as part of the precautionary measures against spread of COVID-19.

According to the orders issued by Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, Chamundi Hills and Chamundeshwari temple will remain out of bounds for the public from midnight of October 14 to midnight of October 18 and again from 5 a.m. on October 23 to midnight of November 1.

The ban orders had been issued in view of the possibility of a large number of devotees and general public visiting the temple during the period. Apart from banning entry of public and private vehicles, the order has also prohibited entry to Chamundi Hills from the steps leading to the hill-top.

However, invitees to the inaugural programme of Dasara atop Chamundi Hills scheduled to be held on October 17 will permitted. Also, the vehicles carrying officials and employees engaged in preparation for the inaugural programme are exempted from the ban orders.

The COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, which had visited Mysuru, had recommended that no more than 200 people should be allowed to gather for the Dasara inaugural programme on October 17. Cardiologist C.N. Manjunath, who is also the Director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bengaluru, will be opening this year’s Dasara celebrations.

Also exempted from the ban orders are vehicles carrying VIPs enjoying State and Central government protocol, officials deputed on government duty to Chamundi Hills, emergency services and residents of Chamundi Hills.

The orders have also banned preparation and distribution of prasada or holy offerings on the days on which entry and congregation of people has been banned on Chamundi Hills. However, permission has been granted for carrying out of the daily rituals in the temple by the priests and work by other employees.

The ban orders have been issued by the Deputy Commissioner under Rule 12 of the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases COVID-19 Regulations 2020 and provisions of Disaster Management Act 2005 to prevent spread of COVID-19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/chamundi-hills-to-be-out-of-bounds-for-general-public/article32854055.ece
122,2020/10/14,Swab tests cross 2 lakh-mark as testing ramped up in Mysuru,"Private hospitals sharing data on beds with Health Department for better handling of COVID-19 situation

Even as Mysuru is gearing up for the low-key Dasara fete amidst the COVID-19 fear, the testing ahead of the festivities has been stepped up and the number of swab tests in government-run labs, including the District Hospital and the MMCRI’s K.R. Hospital, has crossed the 2 lakh-mark. Until Tuesday, 2,03,101 samples had been tested in Mysuru’s COVID-19 labs.

Also, the number of tests in the private labs is inching closer to the 30,000-mark. Till Tuesday, 28,004 samples had been tested in the private labs across Mysuru.

The Mysuru district administration had sought two-weeks’ time to show results in reigning in the pandemic whose cases had been spiralling since the past few days, with cases ranging between 800-1,000 a day. On the government’s order, it identified the focus area - stepping up testing and isolating the contacts of the infected persons within the specified time as the majority of cases reported daily involve them – for stopping the infection from spreading to the larger community.

If the Mysuru COVID-19 figures of the last three days are analysed, the daily tests were on the rise in the government labs but they are within 4,000 per day. The number of tests done on Tuesday was 3,970 while it was 3,347 and 3,014 on Monday and Sunday respectively.

The testing in private labs seems picking up as 636 tests were done on Tuesday and 633 on Monday. The tests include RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs).

Meanwhile, the info shared on beds by the private hospitals following a meeting here recently has perhaps helped the district administration and the Department of Health and Family Welfare in tackling the pandemic situation, especially the fatality rate.

The details of beds, including occupied and vacant, in private hospitals are now being updated daily after the government and the district administration directed them to set aside 50 per cent of beds for treating COVID-19 patients.

The data was shared with the district health officer (DHO), and hospitals cannot say “no beds” to patients since the department can question them for denying the beds when they are available as per their assertion.

As on Tuesday, out of 875 beds in private hospitals for COVID-19, 685 beds had been occupied and 190 were vacant. All put together, the total number of beds available in Mysuru, including government and private facilities, was 3,231, and 1,691 beds had been occupied till Tuesday with 1,540 beds vacant.

Majority of asymptomatic patients are home isolated. Those facing problems in home isolation are opting to stay in Dedicated COVID-19 Health Care Centres and COVID-19 Care Centeres (CCCs).

The active cases in Mysuru stand at 6,843 and nearly 80 per cent of the cases are in home isolation (5,049 cases). As many as 681 patients are being treated in private hospitals and about 512 patients are in government-run COVID-19 Care Centres. As many as 179 patients are in private CCCs.

Plans are also afoot to set up new swab collection centres, including mobile labs, and testing labs for increasing the number of tests to an additional 3,000 to 4,000 a day.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/swab-tests-cross-2-lakh-mark-as-testing-ramped-up-in-mysuru/article32853668.ece
123,2020/10/14,Govt. to bear treatment expenses of teacher who has COVID-19,"CM responds to Facebook post of Moodbidri girl, asks district administration to help her mother

Responding to a post on Facebook by the daughter of Padmakshi N., a teacher in a government aided school who is undergoing treatment for COVID-19 in a private hospital here, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Wednesday directed the district administration to bear all treatment expenses of the teacher.

On Tuesday, Aishwarya Jain from Moodbidri, the daugther of Ms. Padmakshi, who is a faculty member in Jawaharlal Nehru Makki Aided High School, wrote about the critical condition of her mother, who was in the intensive care unit of Indiana Hospital since September 29 after testing positive. In the post, Ms. Jain said her father Shashikanth Y., the headmaster of DJ Higher Primary Aided School, who was also tested positive, was finding it hard to pay the hospital bills. He was also under stress due to the ongoing situation, she said.

Seeking financial help, Ms. Jain, who is a final year BE student in a private college in Moodbidri, held the Vidgyagama scheme of neighbourhood schooling, in which her parents were involved, responsible for the present situation. “Hope government will not let its teachers down in such need of the hour,” she said in her post.

In a joint statement on Wednesday, Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra and Deputy Director of Public Instruction Malleswamy said Mr. Yediyurappa has directed the district administration to arrange all necessary speciality services to Ms. Padmakshi. Accordingly, Mr. Rajendra spoke to the doctors of the private hospital and asked them not collect any charges from the family members of the teacher.

The two officials said Ms. Padmakshi tested negative for COVID-19 on October 13 and she has been shifted to the general ward where she was being given oxygen therapy. Mr. Shashikanth, who tested positive after his 11-year-old son Anai tested positive on October 2, has recovered along with his son, following home isolation, they said.

Happy over the response of the government, Ms. Jain told The Hindu that she and other family members are praying for the speedy recovery of her mother.

Primary and Secondary Education Minister Suresh Kumar, in a Facebook post, thanked Ms. Jain for bringing to the government’s notice the plight of her parents.

124,2020/10/14,Incessant rains wreak havoc in Kalaburagi,"Overflowing rivers have cut connectivity between villages and towns

Heavy rains that began late on Tuesday and continued till Wednesday morning threw normal life out of gear in Kalaburagi and other parts of Kalyana Karnataka region.

While the low-lying areas in towns and cities, including residential localities, remained inundated throughout the night, overflowing rivers, rivulets, tributaries and streams have cut the connectivity between villages and towns.

Kagina river in Kalaburagi district is in spate submerging many of its bridges including Malkhed, Kachur and Dandoti bridges. All the routes that connected Sedam town with Kalaburagi city have been closed. The submergence of Malkhed bridgein Sedam taluk has cut the key connectivity between Kalaburagi and Hyderabad. Many trucks transporting goods between Mumbai and Chennai and Kalaburagi and Hyderabad were found parked near toll plazas on either side of the bridge.

The premises of Uttaradi Math on the bank of Kagina river near Malkhed has been flooded. The rising water level in the river was posing a threat to villages such as Samakhed and Dandoti.

The release of excess water from the Chandrampalli dam flooded large tracts of fields with standing crops downstream. Officials said that at least 12 people were stranded in different places in Chicholi taluk and a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team has been dispatched to rescue them.

In Aland taluk, vast tracts of agricultural fields were flooded and standing crops destroyed. According to the sources, Mataki, Hebali, Jeerahalli, Shakapur and other villages in the taluk were the worst hit. The large tank in Mataki is overflowing. The bund of the tank that had breached in 1992 has again breached now, creating panic among the villagers.

In Kalaburagi city, major roads and many houses in the low-lying residential localities have been flooded. Venkatesh Nagar, Godutai Nayar, Panchasheel Colony, and Puja Colony are the worst-hit. In Chincholi town, houses at Harijanwada, Mominpur and other localities were flooded.

126,2020/10/14,Activists take to the street in Kalaburagi,"Condemning the Hathras gang-rape and demanding stringent punishment for the culprits, hundreds of activists belonging to the Karnataka Rajya Dalit Sangharsh Samiti took out a procession and staged a demonstration in Kalaburagi on Tuesday.

The activists, led by samiti State convenor D.G. Sagar, took out a protest rally on Jagat Road holding blue banners, waving flags and raising slogans against the culprits as well as the Uttar Pradesh government.

Later, they staged a demonstration outside the district administrative complex and submitted a memorandum, addressed to the President, to the office of the Deputy Commissioner.

“Uttar Pradesh has hitherto been known as a land of rowdies. With a series of rapes being reported, it is now becoming a land of rapists. Under the BJP government, lawlessness has become the order of the day. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath himself is protecting the rapists. We appeal to the President to intervene and ensure that the culprits in the recent rape cases get stringent punishment,” Mr. Sagar said, during the agitation.

Taking serious exceptions to the remarks of Mr. Adityanath over the incident, Mr. Sagar said that the Chief Minister’s words were encouraging to upper caste rapists. “Considering the fact that the culprits in the Hathras gang-rape belonged to the Thakur caste, Mr. Adityanath said that Thakur blood is hot and Thakurs tend to make mistakes. His words, indeed, justified the rape of a Dalit girl by upper caste men. His police are trying to protect the culprits. We appeal to the President to dissolve the Adityanath government for its failure to keep law and order,” he said.

In a memorandum, the agitating activists also demanded a compensation of ₹ 2 crore to the family members of rape victims. Their other demands included ensuring stringent punishment to the offenders and providing protection to the families of rape victims.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1mylme/article32848780.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGKALABURAGIRALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/activists-take-to-the-street-in-kalaburagi/article32848783.ece
127,2020/10/14,Street meetings held at various localities in Dharwad,"Members of All India Mahila Samskrutika Sanghatane seek justice for Hathras gang-rape and murder victim’s family

Members of All India Mahila Samskrutika Sanghatane (AIMSS) held street meetings at various localities in Dharwad on Tuesday condemning the Hathras incident and the Uttar Pradesh government’s apathy towards in providing justice to the victim’s family.

The Hathras rape and assault incident took place in September; it will be a month on October 14. And, as mark of a protest, the Dharwad district committee of AIMSS organised street meetings by the roadside at various localities.

The street meetings were held at the City Bus Terminal, the Old Bus Station, the Vivekananda Circle, among other places.

The protestors sang songs, raised slogans and highlighted the need for raising voice against such inhuman crimes and also the need for a united fight to get justice to the victim’s family.

District secretary of AIMSS Vijayalakshmi Devatkal said that recurrence of such inhuman crimes had made one to wonder whether society one lived in was civil. “The Uttar Pradesh government has indulged in character assassination of the victim in a bid to protect the accused who belong to the powerful community of the State. The way the incident had unravelled clearly indicated how the system looked at women and how women from the lower classes were being exploited,” she said.

District AIMSS vice-president Gangubai Kokare said that the incident also revealed the patriarchal mindset of society. She said that sex and violence in mainstream films, pornography, vulgar literature, drugs and liquor were the main cause for the increase in such crimes and they should be totally banned.

AIMSS joint secretary Devamma demanded speedy trial in the case in a fast track court outside Uttar Pradesh and stringent punishment to all those involved in the crime. She also sought action against the police officials who had denied a decent funeral for the victim.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mgw4ex/article32848772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14HBHUBBALLISTREETMEETINGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/street-meetings-held-at-various-localities-in-dharwad/article32848773.ece

129,2020/10/14,Candlelight march in protest against Hathras gang-rape,"As part of their “protest week”, students associated with All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) took out a candlelight march in Kalaburagi on Tuesday evening condemning the rape-and-murder of a 19-year-old woman at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh.

Earlier in the day, the agitating students actively participated in a campaign on Twitter between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., condemning the brutal crime and demanding justice for the victim.

“Uttar Pradesh under the BJP is increasingly becoming unsafe for women and weaker sections of society. The increasing sexual assaults on women and atrocities on Dalits speak volumes about the derailed law and order in that State. Uttar Pradesh Police are trying to protect the guilty. A case should be booked against the police who deliberately delayed registering an FIR, denied proper medical care to the victim and tried to destroy all evidence of the crime,” said H.S. Hanamantha, district president of AIDSO, after paying homage to the victim at SVP Circle here.

Sneha Kattimani, a student leader, demanded that the government put the case on fast track for quick hearing and disposal so that the culprits could be punished at the earliest. “It is very much clear that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had failed to ensure women safety in his State. To douse the protests that were erupting across the country in condemnation of the rape, the government is trying to brand the agitations as international conspiracy,” she said.

The students also opposed the recent amendment to farm legislation terming them “anti-people”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bobkq8/article32848754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGCANDLELIGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/candlelight-march-in-protest-against-hathras-gang-rape/article32848755.ece
130,2020/10/14,Parents demand extension of RTE quota till Class 10,"Many who are unable to pay the fees have been denied access to online classes

Many parents whose children were admitted under the RTE quota to private schools and have completed Class 8 in the 2019-20 academic year are left in the lurch as the State government has not extended the RTE quota till Class 10.

School managements are asking these parents to pay the fees if they want their children to be admitted to Class 9. As many parents are unable to pay the fees, their children have been denied access to online classes, they alleged. There are parents who have pulled out their children out of school and admitted them in either low budget private schools or government schools as they are unable to pay the fees. An autorickshaw driver whose daughter completed Class 8 in 2019-20 under the RTE quota in a private school said that the school was not allowing her to attend online classes for Class 9 as the government has not extended it to this year.

“I have not put her in another school as I am waiting for the State government to take a decision. She has not touched a notebook or textbook since March. She is keen on studying, but I cannot pay the ₹40,000 that the private school is asking me to pay,” he said.

The State government, however, has not taken any decision in this regard which has put parents in a dilemma. While the State government was initially mulling over the possibility of extending the quota beyond Class 8 for students from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities, the move was met with opposition from parents who were not from these communities and they demanded that it should be extended to all students.

Officials of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education said the State government is not keen on extending this move as it incurs a cost of around ₹560 crore on tuition reimbursements to private schools.

Across all classes, 5.06 lakh students are currently studying in private schools under the 25% reservation quota.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yb3ica/article32848742.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGRTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/parents-demand-extension-of-rte-quota-till-class-10/article32848743.ece
131,2020/10/14,Body found; investigation reveals it was murder,"When farmers found a body floating in the Krishna waters near Athani a few days ago, they informed the police. Police officers who retrieved the body were surprised to find gold biscuits valued at ₹ 77 lakh in a trouser pocket.

Routine investigation led them to Patagaon village in Maharashtra. A woman from the village came to Athani and identified the man as her husband Sagar Patil.

She said that her husband had left with another person from Athani to work in a gold jewellery shop in Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Nagar, earlier known as Mughalsarai, in Uttar Pradesh, a few months ago. She had not heard of him since then.

Athani Police identified the other person as Santosh Patil, who is related to Sagar Patil. He revealed that Sagar Patil had gone missing.

Meanwhile, Belagavi Police, who got in touch with Uttar Pradesh police, came to know that Sagar Patil and his friend Navanath Babar had hatched a conspiracy to steal gold from Santosh Patil’s shop.

Sagar Patil took some gold biscuits and money and fled to Athani from Uttar Pradesh. Navanath Babar, who met him at the border, killed him and took his bag containing the valuables. He threw the body in the Krishna, without realising that there were some gold biscuits left in a trouser pocket.

132,2020/10/14,Special trains to operate from State till Nov. 30,"Railways to operate 196 pairs from Oct. 20 to Nov. 30

The Railway Ministry on Tuesday announced introduction of 196 pairs of festival special trains, mostly comprising inter-State long distance services to be operational between October 20 and November 30, including about 28 pairs operating out of Karnataka.

These special trains were being introduced in view of the upcoming Dasara and Deepavali festivals.

In a message to the GMs of Zonal Railways, the Ministry told them to ensure the special services are operated at a minimum speed of 55 kmph so that they become super-fast services. The Ministry also asked the zones to operate the special services with more number of AC 3-Tier coaches that were in good condition. This was in line with the recent announcement of the Ministry that long-distance super-fast trains would come to have more AC coaches in the place of Second Sleeper coaches. Fares applicable for these special trains would be as those applicable to special trains.

While a majority of trains operate from cities like Bengaluru, Mysuru and Hubballi, other parts of Karantaka have not got their due, rue railway activists. Kalyana Karnataka did not get any festival specials, rued rail activist Sunil Kulkarni. Places such as Kalaburagi, Raichur, Yadgir, Bidar, Koppal and Ballari did not get trains. Similarly, Mangaluru region too did not get any festival specials. Though Central Railway had proposed to reintroduce Mumbai CSMT-Mangaluru Junction-Mumbai CSMT Special (earlier 12133/34), the same appears to have not been approved by the Ministry.

Some of the trains to be operated from South Western Railway include, Train No. 02251/52 Yeshwantpur-Korba-Yeshwantpur (weekly); 02253/54 Yeshwantpur-Bhagalpur-Yeshwantpur (weekly); 02539/40 Yeshwantpur-Lucknow-Yeshwantpur (weekly); 02607/08 and 02657/58 Chennai-Bengaluru-Chennai (daily) and 06231/32 Mayiladutarai-Bengaluru-Mayiladutarai (daily).",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/swdfco/article32848722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGTRAIN2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/special-trains-to-operate-from-state-till-nov-30/article32848724.ece

134,2020/10/14,"More than 29,000 children ‘disappeared’from RTE quota over last eight years","43,626 were admitted under it for class 1 in 2012

In the first year that the RTE Act was implemented in Karnataka in 2012, as many as 43,626 students were admitted under the 25% reservation quota for class one in private unaided schools. Eight years on, only 13,910 of them are availing themselves of this benefit.

As many as 29,716 among these children are no longer under the quota, according to records of the Department of Public Instruction. This is for a variety of reasons, including parents being unable to afford fee for “extracurricular activities” that schools allegedly demand.

While many are no longer under the quota, others were unable to access education in these private schools till class eight as they did not have upper primary classes. Other reasons cited include schools being shut down and parents relocating. According to department rules, reservation under the quota can be availed of only in the school where the child has been admitted. Surprisingly, the department has also found a few instances where students who were initially admitted under the RTE quota later migrating to non-RTE quota in the same school.

The State government reimburses the fees to private schools for every child from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities admitted under the RTE quota. The per-child expenditure is currently capped at ₹8,000 for pre-primary and ₹16,000 for primary classes.

B.N. Yogananda, general secretary, RTE Students’ and Parents’ Association, said a large number of parents pulled their children out as they could not afford to pay the “extra fees” demanded by school managements for books, uniforms, smart classes, and other extracurricular activities.

“Although the department on paper tells us that schools cannot collect any fees for the RTE students besides for books and uniform, the reality is far from it,” he said. Parents even alleged that the extra fees collected by school were in the range of ₹5,000 to ₹50,000 a year in some instances. Rishikesh B.S., associate professor, Azim Premji University, said very few private schools had implemented the reservation quota in spirit and had taken steps to bridge the socio-cultural gap between students admitted under the quota and the rest. “While many private school managements evaded admitting students under the quota by claiming minority status, many other schools pushed students out by charging extra fees,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/more-than-29000-children-disappearedfrom-rte-quota-over-last-eight-years/article32848713.ece

With over 1.17 lakh people recovering since October 1, Karnataka’s total recoveries breached the six lakh mark on Tuesday. With 10,421 patients getting discharged in the last 24 hours, the total recoveries touched 6,02,505.

Recoveries that crossed the one lakh mark on August 11 shot up considerably since then. A total of 3,47,879 people have beaten the infection from September 1 onwards and recoveries have outnumbered active cases by over five times. Over 58% of the total recoveries have happened since then. The State’s recovery rate rose after the State tweaked its discharge policy in August. While in the initial months, patients were being discharged only after two negative reports within 48 hours, the State changed its policy that allowed a patient’s discharge after 10 days if he/she does not have any symptoms for three consecutive days before discharge. The recovery rate that was just about 50.73% till August 6, now stands at 83%. The national average is 87% as of Tuesday. Recovery rate in at least 17 districts in the State is higher than the national average.

Stating that an increasing recovery rate is a positive sign, Giridhara R. Babu, member of State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said: “As recoveries increase, we will soon reach a stage where the growth rate of recoveries too will plateau till active cases come down.”

Stating that the recovery rate reflects whether the curve flattens and bends, he said the focus must continue to be on doing more and more tests using a syndromic approach.

Meanwhile, the State on Tuesday reported 8,191 new cases taking the total number to 7,26,106. With 87 new deaths, the toll rose to 10,123. This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths.

Active cases continued to remain over lakh with 1,13,459. Of these, 919 patients are being monitored in the ICUs.

As many as 1,06,241 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, including 43,023 rapid antigen tests.

The drilling was started on BGML lands to identify non-mineral areas and hand them over for development as an industrial park by the State government.

“Happy to convey that exploratory drilling at Betrayaswamy block of Kolar Gold Field commenced today. This will help in resolving the BGML issue which has been pending for the last 16 years,” tweeted Union Coals and Mines Minister Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday.

After a meeting with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on August 28, Mr. Joshi said the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd. would identify areas that have not been explored for natural minerals within six months. If after the survey the land parcel does not possess any minerals, it will be handed over to the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board to set up the industrial park.

The land is strategically located, at 90 km from Bengaluru airport, 260 km from Chennai port, and 314 km from Krishnapatnam port.

138,2020/10/14,How will COVID-19 norms be enforced during festival season: Karnataka HC,"The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the State government to explain how it plans to ensure COVID-19 safety norms such as social distancing and wearing of masks are followed strictly during the upcoming festival season at public places such as markets.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi issued the direction during the hearing of PIL petitions related to COVID-19 health management.

Earlier, it was pointed out to the Bench by the counsel for a petitioner that as already a large section of the public was not wearing masks in public places, a similar attitude during congregations during the festival season might result in a greater spread of COVID-19.

Bed availability

The Bench directed the government to submit its policy on reserving 50% beds in private hospitals for COVID-19 patients. This direction was issued after noting that the data submitted by the government indicated that there were only 44,848 beds reserved for COVID-19 patients in both public and private hospitals across the State.

As there was a confusion over whether the data on beds reserved for COVID-19 patients was complete, the Bench asked the government to look into the numbers again. It pointed out that the number of beds available was low given the steep rise in the number of COVID-19 patients last fortnight. The Bench also asked the government to state whether any exercise has been carried out recently on the requirement of beds as per the mandate for preparedness under the Disaster Management Act based on the projection of COVID-19 cases.

Meanwhile, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike informed the Bench that 62 of the 380 hospitals designated for COVID-19 had been inspected by special teams set up by the monitoring committee so far and that inspections would be carried out at the rate of two to four hospitals every day.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/n3jomo/article32823401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10KRAKARHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/how-will-covid-19-norms-be-enforced-during-festival-season-karnataka-hc/article32848478.ece

140,2020/10/14,JD(S) picks V. Krishnamurthy as R.R. Nagar bypoll candidate,"After long deliberations, the Janata Dal (S) on Tuesday announced V. Krishnamurthy as its nominee for the Rajarajeshwarinagar byelection. He, accompanied by former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, will file his nomination papers on Wednesday, a release from the party said.

While the JD(S) had announced Ammajamma, wife of the late MLA B. Sathyanarayana, as the candidate in Sira last week, the R.R. Nagar candidate announcement had been delayed.

Insiders said the party wanted to wait till the BJP formally announced its candidate. The JD(S) announcement came soon after the BJP finally announced Munirathna as its candidate in R.R. Nagar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jds-picks-v-krishnamurthy-as-rr-nagar-bypoll-candidate/article32848450.ece
141,2020/10/14,Munirathna and Rajesh Gowda are BJP candidates for bypolls,"Ending days of speculation, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced former MLA Munirathna, who joined the party last year after quitting the Congress, as its candidate in the byelection to Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly seat. Another new entrant to the party, Rajesh Gowda, a medical practitioner, has been given ticket to contest in Sira.

The R.R. Nagar seat had fallen vacant following the resignation of Mr. Munirathna, who had won in 2018 on Congress ticket. The Sira seat fell vacant following the death of JD(S) MLA B. Sathyanarayana.

There were several aspirants from the BJP’s own cadre for both seats. But consistent with its stand of giving tickets to those from other parties who quit their Assembly membership to help the saffron party capture power in the State, the BJP central election committee picked Mr. Munirathna.

Much uncertainty

There was uncertainty as the party’s State core committee had recommended the name of local leader Tulsi Muniraju Gowda along with that of Mr. Munirathna. However, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is said to have insisted on giving ticket to Mr. Munirathna on the grounds that he had crossed over to the BJP following an assurance of getting ticket to contest bypolls.

However, concerns are far from over for Mr. Munirathna as the State BJP leaders now have the onerous task of making the party workers and grassroots leaders, along with Mr. Gowda, fall in line in R.R. Nagar. The party had a running feud with Mr. Munirathna when he was a Congress leader and poll opponent for a long time.

In fact, the announcement of ticket for Mr. Munirathna came only after the Supreme Court rejected a plea by Mr. Gowda challenging the Karnataka High Court’s order rejecting his election petition against Mr. Munirathna.

‘Inevitable’

Defending the selection of candidates, a prominent BJP leader said this choice was “inevitable” as the party did not have strong candidates from its own cadre. He sought to remind those critical of the choice that the party was trying to make inroads in these two constituencies where its rivals have a strong voter base.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/munirathna-and-rajesh-gowda-are-bjp-candidates-for-bypolls/article32848438.ece
142,2020/10/14,GST compensation: State may move SC,"Borrowing from open market

Kerala may move the Supreme Court against the decision of the Union Finance Ministry to allow 20 States to borrow from the open market as per Option I of borrowing to meet the Goods and Service Tax (GST) compensation shortfall. The move comes in the wake of the Ministry’s decision on Tuesday to allow borrowing from the open market even as the GST Council failed to arrive at a decision on the vexed issue after three meetings.

Kerala was the first to oppose the Centre’s option to provide a special borrowing window to States in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India to provide ₹97,000 crore at a reasonable interest rate and meet the entire GST compensation gap of ₹1.35 lakh crore this year itself after consulting the central bank.

“The Union government is trying to divide the States permanently as those agreeing to the proposals for GST compensation and those opposed to them,” Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac told The Hindu.

“They have the majority and if they take a decision, it will be binding for the minority-opined States. Instead, they are pushing for consensus and forcing everyone to accept their opinion. They want to discriminate due to the unilateral decision taken by them and it is totally unacceptable.”

Meet tomorrow

The Chief Minister is holding a meeting on Friday with the Law Department and other officials and other States are also preparing to approach the Supreme Court. Dr. Isaac said the court cannot put it aside like the habeas corpus of Kashmir as nine States would approach it.

The majority of the nine States that are opposing the proposals are ruled by the Congress and Kerala by the Left Democratic Front. “We have no problem in going with Congress-ruled States jointly to the Supreme Court. We are preparing and we will ensure that all of us move on the same ground,” Dr. Isaac said.

Coming down heavily on Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Dr. Isaac said she was “destroying the GST Council”. Announcements were made not at the council meetings but at press conferences and this was unacceptable.

The Finance Minister said a GST Council decision was required for Option I because it involved postponement, deferment of the compensation payment made beyond five years. Without a council decision, the Centre cannot decide.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gst-compensation-state-may-move-sc/article32857011.ece
143,2020/10/14,Sivasankar seeks anticipatory bail,"‘Enforcement Directorate trying to falsely implicate me in gold smuggling case’

M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, on Wednesday approached the Kerala High Court seeking anticipatory bail in a case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case.

In his petition, he said he apprehended his illegal arrest on the basis of the chargesheet submitted by the ED before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Though the petitioner was questioned for more than 90 hours by different agencies, no incriminating materials could be gathered by them to implicate him in the alleged crime. The ED questioned him on three occasions for 30 hours, but the petitioner had not been arraigned as an accused in the ED’s final report.

Baseless charges

He alleged that the ED had levelled baseless allegations against him to indicate that he had some connection with the alleged smuggling activities. In fact, he had conceded the fact of his acquaintance with Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the case, while she was working as secretary to the UAE Consulate General.

The petitioner was holding a key post in the government then and he had occasions to contact the Consulate General in connection with his duties. In fact, the petitioner came to know that Swapna and her friends used to bring gold to India misusing the office of Consulate General only after a consignment was seized by the Customs, he said.

False impression

The specific case of the prosecution was that the smuggling activities started in November 2019. However, WhatsApp message exchanges between the petitioner and his chartered accountant that took place well before this date were needlessly annexed to create a false impression that the petitioner had some involvement in the crime committed by Swapna and others.

Besides, he was only aware of Swapna’s “acceptance of tip from the ruler of Sharjah”. It was on her request that the petitioner had introduced his chartered accountant to Swapna. He was not aware of any other money transaction of the accused, he said.

He feared that the investigating agency would be forced to arrest him to avoid criticism from media.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sivasankar-seeks-anticipatory-bail/article32856974.ece

Along with the increasing number of new patients, spike in Category C was another major challenge faced by the department. According to Health officials, emergency measures have been activated and the district is fully equipped to manage with its own resources.

“Around 10 private hospitals in the district have now started admitting COVID-19 patients and more COVID-19 Second-line Treatment Centres (SLTC) will opened soon. All SLTCs will be attached to taluk hospitals so that COVID-19 hospitals can focus more on Category C. Local bodies have expressed their willingness to start ward-level SLTCs,” says Deputy DMO R.Sandhya.

The Department has also arranged special provisions for expectant mothers and patients who require dialysis. Pregnant woman and those with gynaecological emergencies will be admitted at Ramarao Memorial Taluk Hospital, Nedungolam if they test positive.

Surge

“If there is a surge, the hospital is prepared to take more patients,” she says. In order to manage dialysis cases, the department has started extra shifts at the units in some government facilities.

“Now the non-COVID-19 patients can depend on these hospitals and even if the situation aggravates we will be able to manage,” she said

The Department has also instructed private hospitals to encourage Category A patients to remain in home care. If the patients in home care develop any complications, the COVID-19 corners in taluk hospitals will handle them.

“Patients can go to all empanelled private hospitals with a referral letter from the department to get free treatment. Doctors can refer them to hospitals with vacant beds as COVID-19 Jagratha portal will have all the updated details,” says Dr.Sandhya.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/551-new-cases-in-kollam/article32856834.ece

Cheruthoni dam

The dam safety wing of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) may recommend opening of the Cheruthoni dam if the rainfall continues at this level after October 15.

The water level in the Idukki reservoir on Wednesday was 2,392.02 ft, over one ft above the blue alert level. The dam safety wing on Tuesday issued the blue alert when the water level reached 2,391.18 ft.

The blue alert level for Wednesday as per the new rule curve level fixed by the Central Water Commission was 2,390.85 ft. The power generation at the Moolamattom powerhouse of the Idukki reservoir was raised to 7.04 million units on Tuesday as decided at a power position meeting.

A KSEB official (Transmission, System Operation) said the dam safety wing was monitoring the situation and water would be released from the reservoir if needed. Earlier it was decided to surrender power from the central pool and make use of the extra power generated at Moolamattom.

“Now we have got a better option to sell the extra power and it is being taken,” he said, adding that four of the six generators were being operated.

Meanwhile, the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam on Wednesday was 127.25 ft. Despite Tamil Nadu drawing water more than the normal level, the water level rose from the previous day following heavy rainfall. The maximum water level as per a Supreme Court order is 142 ft.

148,2020/10/14,"Swapna, Sandeep go into COFEPOSA detention","They will have relatively more freedom and relaxed time table

The two main accused in the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case commenced their one-year preventive detention period under the provisions of the COFEPOSA here on Wednesday.

They are Sandeep Nair and Swapna Suresh. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had arrested them on the charge of imperilling the economic security of the country under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in July from Bangalore by illegally importing gold in diplomatic cargo marked to the UAE consulate here.

The accused had spent much of their days since their arrest by the NIA in judicial remand or in the custody of Central law enforcement agencies, including the Customs (Preventive) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

The Customs had invoked the provisions of the COFEPOSA after the period of detention of the suspects ended recently. The NIA and the ED had opposed their bail in court. However, investigators felt the chance of the accused bail had improved given their long period in detention and repeated custodial questioning.

The NIA told the court that granting bail to the main accused would deter the progress of the probe. Moreover, the investigators felt that Sandeep Nair, who had given a voluntary confession about the crime under 164 Cr.PC to a magistrate, was vulnerable to threat and physical assault given the possibility that his deposition could bolster the NIA’s case against Swapna and others.

Jail wardens from Kochi escorted Nair to the Central prison here. They admitted Swapna, who was in a sub-jail for women in Ernakulam, to the preventive detention block of the Women’s Jail at Attakulangara. As COFEPOSA prisoners, the accused would have relatively more freedom and a relaxed time table compared to their term as remand prisoners.

The law enforcement had accused Swapna Suresh and P. Sarith of exploiting their stature as UAE consulate officials, to abet the smuggling of gold into the country in air frieght addressed to the foreign staff at the diplomatic mission.

The Customs suspect the accused had conducted 21 successful runs during the 2018-2020 period and illegally imported gold in bulk under cover of diplomatic trust and goodwill. So far, the agencies have arrested 21 persons in connection with the racket. They have sought the custody of two persons detained in Dubai.

The overlapping investigations by Central agencies into the racket had opened a Pandora’s box of allegations against the government. They resulted in the interrogation of at least one Minister and several top IAS officials, including the former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, M. Sivasankar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/zhqtd8/article32856987.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/swapna-sandeep-go-into-cofeposa-detention/article32855982.ece

Kerala’s COVID-19 case graph did another unusual turn when on Wednesday, it recorded a steep drop in daily case burden to 6,244 cases when 50,056 samples were tested in the past 24 hours.

For the second time in the week, the number of recoveries reported on the day exceeded the new cases, as 7,792 people were discharged from hospitals. The test positivity rate, which had reached 18.16% the previous day, inexplicably plunged to 12.4% on Wednesday.

Last week also, the State’s case graph had plunged low mid-week, only to go up again the next day and this had been attributed to a statistical aberration.

The cumulative COVID-19 case burden of the State now stands at 3,10,140. The total number of recoveries till date being 2,15,149, the number of active cases in the State is 93,837. Of these patients, 715 are critical and being treated in ICUs with another 166 put on ventilator support.

151,2020/10/14,Many hurdles for KC(M) to align with LDF,"Party’s performance in upcoming local body elections to be crucial

The decision by the Kerala Congress (M) [KC(M)] led by Jose K. Mani to align with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) has meant that an alliance is no longer as unthinkable as once it made out to be. But the move, it seems, has also left many a question unanswered.

For instance, it is still unclear that where Mr. Mani would be inducted into the LDF before the upcoming local body election.

According to sources, the performance of the KC(M) during the upcoming local body elections would have a great bearing on the regional party’s power to bargain within the LDF and hence, the first major challenge before Mr. Mani was to show his strength at the grassroots level, at least in Kottayam.

Workers’ confidence

Similarly, restoring the confidence of workers at the grassroots in him also appear to be a major challenge for the party as the pro-UDF workers in different local bodies across the region have already begun quitting the party to join the rival faction led by P.J. Joseph

Though there are reports that Mr. Mani, who quit the Rajya Sabha seat he had won as a UDF candidate, will get the same berth from the LDF, no formal announcement has been made in this regard.

With the KC(B) and the KC (Skaria Thomas) already in its fold, the Left coalition expects to make considerable advance in the Central Travancore region during the upcoming Assembly elections.

While the LDF counts on the association with the Mani group will help consolidate the Christian voter in its favour, the Mani group hopes to maintain its dominance in as many as 12 seats with the Left support.

Arithmetical majority

“Though no overarching trend is discernible, there may be an arithmetical majority when the KC(M) joins hands with the LDF. But whether the mandate of the Left parties and the Kerala Congress, which predominantly has a UDF voter base, can be allied without contradiction remains to be seen,” observed a senior Congress leader.

Of these, finding a way to get the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the CPI agree on the Pala and Kanjirappally seats respectively, will likely prove to be the biggest challenge.

Despite asserting that the party was yet to initiate discussions regarding the seats, Mr. Mani, however, has made it clear time and again that Pala always remained pivotal to its political project. The LDF too, it is learnt to have responded positively to this particular demand.

But at the same time, it is learnt to have not given any such assurances with regard to Kanjirappally, the sitting seat of N. Nayaraj MLA, a close associate of Mr. Mani.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/many-hurdles-for-kcm-to-align-with-ldf/article32855551.ece
152,2020/10/14,"Pro-Mani MP, MLAs must quit: Cong.","The defection of the Jose. K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) to the LDF appeared to have caused a profound sense of betrayal in the Congress leadership here.

The development has arguably left the UDF a diminished coalition. However, it also seemed to have infused a sense of determination to fight back.

UDF convener M.M. Hassan fired the first salvo by demanding the resignation of MP from Kottayam, Thomas Chazhikadan, who won the seat on the coalition’s ticket. The UDF also wanted two MLAs aligned with Mr. Mani’s faction to quit their posts.

Pala seat

The UDF was not opposed to accommodating Mani. C. Kappan, MLA, of the National Congress Party (NCP) whose Pala seat was at stake given Mr. Mani’s “claim” over the constituency.

KPCC president Mullapally Ramachandran said Mr. Mani had forsaken the legacy of KC(M) founder K. M. Mani by aligning with the LDF.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that Mr Mani had stabbed the UDF in the back. His misplaced machinations had cost the coalition the Pala seat in the elections that followed the death of K.M. Mani. He said Mr. Mani always had coveted membership in the LDF and worked for it secretly.

153,2020/10/14,Anganwadis in Kerala to admit 2-3 year olds,"Project to be piloted in Ithikkara in Kollam

The Women and Child Development Department has decided to pilot a project for admitting children in the 2-3 age group to anganwadis in the State.

The project will first be launched at Ithikkara in Kollam district. All anganwadis under the Ithikkara Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) will admit students in the 2-3 age group along with preschool children in the 3-6 age group.

Department officials said many parents inquired about letting two-to-three-year-old children stay in the anganwadis. This was especially the case if both parents were working and there was no one to take care of the children. While some anganwadi workers and supervisors did permit the children, others did not. Also, such children could not be registered in the anganwadis.

Children not admitted to anganwadis were left in day-care facilities, and were likely to continue there for the next few years. However, if children in the 2-3 age group could be admitted to anganwadis, they would stay on there.

Separate register

Department officials said a separate admission register would be maintained in anganwadis for children in the 2-3 age group.

At present those below the age of three were provided Amritham ‘nutrimix’ as take-home ration. However, when these children attended the anganwadis, more funds would be needed to provide them three meals similar to other anganwadi children. The Ithikkara panchayat had agreed to set aside more funds for this supplementary nutrition programme, they said.

After reopening

The project will be implemented after anganwadis reopen as part of the phased unlocking of public activity. Directions will be given to the Child Development Project Officer to make preliminary arrangements for rolling out the project then.

Depending on its success, the project will be extended to other districts this financial year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/anganwadis-in-kerala-to-admit-2-3-year-olds/article32855328.ece
154,2020/10/14,Guidelines formed for pooling resources in critical care,"Districts asked to seek voluntary involvement of critical care specialists in private sector

With the number of those requiring critical care for COVID-19 on the rise, the Health Department has formulated new guidelines for the efficient management of its pool of intensivists and critical care specialists, so that no COVID-19 patient requiring intensive care is denied services.

Accordingly, all districts have been asked to create its pool of available intensivists and those experienced in critical care management, irrespective of where they are working. This district pool will also include postgraduates in critical care medicine, anaesthesiology, and pulmonology.

All districts have also been asked by the government to engage with the private sector and to facilitate the voluntary involvement of critical care specialists in private hospitals.

All major hospitals managing critically ill COVID-19 patients should ensure round-the-clock services of at least one intensivist/critical care specialist.

The government has directed that in districts where the availability of such specialists are scarce, additional appointment of human resources or outsourcing of services of intensivists for a fixed fee per intervention may be done.

Tele-care services

The Health Department has proposed that hospitals devise an in-house tele-critical-care monitoring room with central monitors, closed circuit television screens, and alarm system. Acute care monitors should be connected to the tele-critical-care monitoring room so that every patient in ICU can be monitored continuously.

Hospitals should also form a crisis crash team that can physically reach patients during emergencies as soon as possible.

Districts should establish a system to assess the skill competence of its junior residents, medical officers, and nurses in basic ICU intervention skills at all hospitals. Training may be organised regularly with the help of critical care experts. Medical colleges can form teams to provide hand-holding support to the recently established ICUs in district and general hospitals.

Hub-and-Spoke model

Government Medical College, Thrissur, has proposed a tele-ICU care service model, which envisages a tele ICU command centre manned round the clock by intensivists, trained nurses, and critical care experts.

One such Command Centre would be able to provide tele-ICU services for one or two districts in a hub-and- spoke model. This means that doctors in one command centre will be able to treat patients in different hospitals.

Necessary infrastructure, including high-speed Internet facility, should be established by districts. District Medical Officers and institutional medical boards have been asked to submit proposals for establishing tele-ICU care services in districts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/guidelines-formed-for-pooling-resources-in-critical-care/article32855312.ece
155,2020/10/14,"Kerala gold smugglers linked to Dawood Ibrahim gang, says NIA","Agency says accused’s association with underworld don needs to be probed

The links of two accused in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case with the gang of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim needs to be probed, feels the National Investigation Agency (NIA).

The accused, Rameez and Sharafuddeen, had smuggled gold from Tanzania to the UAE and from there to India. The Dawood gang is active in both Tanzania and the UAE. Feroz, a person of south Indian origin and a member of the gang is based at Tanzania.

The photos of the visit of the accused to Tanzania were obtained from one of the gadgets seized. Hence, the connection needs to be probed, said the NIA while opposing the bail application of the accused.

Rameez was earlier booked for smuggling 13 rifles of 0.2 bore. The methodology adopted by the accused in the case and the fact that many of those, who invested money for the smuggling, did not collect profit from the illegal activities raise serious concerns about terror funding.

Reinvestment

The Financial Action Task Force had earlier alerted that the tendency to reinvest the profit from illegal activities back to the crime could be an indication of terror funding, it submitted.

As the agency tried to establish culpability of the accused, the court, while noting that the gold smuggling was a serious offence, asked whether it could obtain evidences to justify the slapping of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against the accused even after the completion of 90 days of registering the crime.

NIA counsel replied that the agency needed more time to investigate the crime, which had transnational connections. He also submitted that the agency was swimming against the tide and adverse conditions brought in by the pandemic.

Evidences

The agency, which said it could obtain the mirror images of 22 of the 99 gadgets seized from the accused, relied mostly on the pictures extracted from it. This included the pictures of currency notes and Islamic speaker Zakkir Naik found from the gadget of Swapna Suresh, pictures of gold biscuits being packed for smuggling and its unpacking and fake and forged documents, draft letters, airway bills, and copies of passports of some of the employees of the UAE consulate.

The court will pronounce its order on the bail applications on Thursday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/63f269/article32859236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dawood,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gold-smugglers-linked-to-d-company-nia/article32855252.ece
156,2020/10/14,CERC norms hold grave portent for State,"KSEB takes up concerns with CERC and Centre, plans to challenge directives in HC

The new regulations notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) for interstate power transmission charges payable by the States can have serious financial implications for Kerala, officials of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) have said.

Under the CERC (Sharing of Interstate Transmission System Charges and Losses) Regulations, 2020 — to be effective from November 1 — the charges payable by the State is likely to shoot up to around ₹1,500 crore per year. At present, it comes to approximately ₹550 crore.

Ultimately, this additional financial burden will reflect in the power tariffs since the burden will be passed on to consumers. It is estimated that the tariff can go up by 50 paise per unit, says an official.

In the meantime, the KSEB is planning to challenge the regulations in the High Court. “We have already informed the CERC and the Union Power Ministry of the State’s apprehensions regarding the proposed regulations,” KSEB Chairman and Managing Director N.S. Pillai said.

States such as Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and West Bengal also are likely to experience a hike in transmission charges, while it will significantly dip for several other States.

The reason is that the new regulations seek to change the manner in which the charges for underutilised interstate transmission lines are calculated. “Many interstate lines constructed in recent years by Power Grid Corporation Ltd (PGCIL) remain underutilised. The utilisation of many high-capacity transmission lines is below 30%. At present, the entire charges for these lines are borne by States through which these lines pass through, as they are the ones who use them,” says another official.

Originally constructed to enable export of power by large private sector power generation projects, the lines were later relinquished by the companies when they were unable to find buyers for their power or the projects themselves were not completed on time.

About 34,000 MW of transmission capacity has so far been relinquished by private generating companies out of the 83,000 MW allocated by the PGCIL, according to the officials.

“The CERC issued the new regulations after those States currently burdened by the underutilised lines lodged complaints. However, instead of taking steps to realise the relinquishment charges from the private power generation companies, the CERC is shifting the burden from existing user States to States such as Kerala,” they say.

The new regulations also contradict the tariff policy which require transmission charges to be calculated on the basis of usage. Under the new regulations, however, the charges are segregated into ‘usage’ and ‘balance’ components. The usage component comes to only 22% of total charges. The balance component of 78% is distributed among the States irrespective of whether they are using the lines or not, they say.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cerc-norms-hold-grave-portent-for-state/article32855205.ece
157,2020/10/14,Registration for IITs and NITs ends today,"First round of seat allocation to be published on Saturday

The first round of seat allocation for admission to IITs, NITs, IIITs, and other GFTIs will be published on the website of Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSSA) on Saturday.

The registration and online choice filling which began on October 6 will end at 5 p.m. on Thursday. Already the results of the second round of mock allotment of JoSAA, a counselling meant for candidates who have cleared the Joint Engineering Entrance (JEE), have been announced on their website josaa.nic.in.

Mock allotment is conducted before the actual seat allocation to help candidates to know their chances on the basis of their rank and preference at an institute. This will also help candidates to modify their selected choices of institutes and branch of study.

Sunil Jacob John, chairman, UG Admissions and centre in-charge of Central Seat Allocation Board Verification Centre at National Institute of Technology-Calicut (NIT-C) said that first round of online reporting, fee remittance, document upload and seat acceptance would be held from October 17 to October 19. There would be a total of six regular rounds of seat allocation and online reporting.

Three options

The candidates will have three options to choose – floating, freezing and sliding. The floating option is for those candidates who wish to accept the offered seat but also are looking for a seat in a better or higher preferred college or course.

The freezing option is for candidates who has accepted the allotted seat and do not wish to participate in further rounds. The sliding option enables candidates to accept the allotted seat but are willing to upgrade if admissions are open in a better course at the same institute.

A detailed schedule of all rounds is available on the JoSAA website. Candidates getting allotment in each round should report for online document verification and seat acceptance on the dates specified in the counselling schedule failing which the allotted seat will get forfeited and will be re-allotted to other eligible candidates in the subsequent rounds.

Admission schedule

Candidates who have accepted their seats in any of the six rounds should attend the allotted institute on the dates specified in schedule. For admission to the NIT-C, the schedule is from November 9 to 13.

Prof. John said that the Ministry of Education has not taken a final decision on the physical presence of the candidates at the admitting institute.

The NITC website has an admission link as well. The Help Centre at NITC ( phone: 0495-2286118, 2286110, email: ugadmission@nitc.ac.in) will function during office to assist the candidates in registration and choice filling.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/registration-for-iits-and-nits-ends-today/article32854928.ece
158,2020/10/14,Mani’s Left turn to churn State politics,"Harbinger of realignment ahead of local body elections

The decision of Jose K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) to work in league with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) “without setting any condition” appeared to be a harbinger of further political realignment ahead of the local body elections in Kerala.

Mr. Mani seemed to have set the potential political shifts in motion by publicly severing his party’s 39-year-old association with the United Democratic Front (UDF) on Wednesday.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has welcomed Mr. Mani’s decision and said the LDF would meet to discuss the future of the arrangement.

The CPI, which had expressed reservations about Mr. Mani’s admission to the LDF earlier, has not reacted to the development openly. The party seemed cautious and secretive about its intentions ahead of the LDF leadership conclave.

Political heft

The CPI(M) calculates that Mr. Mani’s “political heft” in central Travancore could tip the scales in its favour in the local body elections and later during the Assembly polls in 2021.

The party also felt Mr. Mani’s abandonment of the UDF had accelerated the political decline of the coalition in the crucial election year.

The growing hope of an LDF entry has reportedly helped Mr. Mani to prevent desertions from his group and close ranks against his KC(M) rival P.J. Joseph.

However, Mr. Mani’s move to relinquish the Rajya Sabha seat he had won on the UDF ticket could spell trouble for the LDF.

Pala seat

The settlement has triggered speculation that Mr. Mani would make a pitch for the Pala Assembly seat now held by the present MLA Mani. C. Kappan of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), a long-time LDF ally.

The UDF felt that a row over the Pala seat would sow seeds of disaffection in the ruling front and cause Mr. Kappan to defect to the Congress-led Opposition front.

UDF attempt

UDF convener M. M. Hassan attempted to make hay out of the perceived restlessness in Mr. Kappan’s camp by stating that the NCP leader had sought an accommodation with the alliance and parleys were in progress with Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala.

Mr. Chennithala refused to elaborate on Mr. Hassan’s claim. However, a Congress leader pointed out the NCP was an ally of the Congress since 1999.

The BJP has also sensed an opportunity in Mr. Mani’s defection. It felt that the UDF had now become an arrangement comprising the Congress and the IUML primarily.

Party president K. Surendran said Mr. Mani’s exit had weakened the UDF and left the field open for an electoral battle between the NDA and LDF in central Travancore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/eolyqw/article32854769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201014-WA0070,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/manis-left-turn-to-churn-state-politics/article32854770.ece

Kadakkal grama panchayat on Wednesday launched biofloc fish farming in connection with Subhiksha Keralam project of the State government.

“While the project offers a good income to the farmers, it will also help the panchayat to attain self-sufficiency in fish production,” said panchayat president R.S.Biju who inaugurated the project.

At present 13 families have been selected for biofloc farming that is considered a very sustainable and eco-friendly method.

The farmers will get a subsidy of ₹36,000 from the panchayat and ₹12,000 from the Fisheries Department. Biofloc farming system is used as a low-cost alternative for intensive fish production as the technology converts waste organic matter into fish feed.

The culture period of the farming is six months while the normal stocking capacity is 1,000 per tank. Expected production of each unit is 1,500 kg.

Panchayat members Shajahan, Shyamala Somarajan, Ashok R Nair, Binumol and Sujeesh Lal were also present on the occasion.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9c1264/article32856952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201014-WA0034,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/biofloc-fish-farming-launched/article32854744.ece

Mr. Joseph said he was humiliated by the Mani faction at an election rally at Pala. He said nobody from the UDF ousted the Jose K. Mani faction. “It itself went out of it. Those who are with the UDF loved K.M. Mani and Jose K. Mani did not heed the words of partners in the UDF.”

In a statement here on Wednesday, NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair urged the authorities concerned that the worship rights of pilgrims should not be treated as a source of income alone. The pilgrimage to Sabarimala was intended to help each pilgrim blend with Lord Ayyappa and hence the regulations should match the spirit of the pilgrimage.

“Each pilgrim should be given the opportunity to take a holy dip in the Pampa and carry out the `neyyabhishekam' after offering a darshan at Sabarimala. Any restrictions without taking these into account do not match the existing traditions and customs,'' the statement said.

The other demands raised by the community organisation included permission to lay `viri' at the sannidhanam in line with the COVID-19 protocol and relaxing the ban on assembly of five or more persons for the pilgrims in Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts.

It further pointed out that the instruction to wear face masks while taking up the trek from Pampa might cause severe health problems to the pilgrims.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ease-norms-for-sabarimala-pilgrims-nss/article32854641.ece
162,2020/10/14,"Kerala Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Act, 2010, to be amended","Step to achieve self-sufficiency in fish production, make aquaculture more scientific

The Kerala Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Act, 2010, will be amended so as to enable conservation of species, scientific breeding, and a sustainable livelihood for the fishing community. The proposed amendments also seek to introduce better control over ornamental fisheries, and fish species introduced into the State.

The Cabinet on Wednesday decided to recommend to Governor Arif Mohammed Khan to promulgate an Ordinance to facilitate the amendment.

The amendment seeks to regulate the fishing of species with low populations during their breeding seasons. A minimum legal size will be determined for the fish that can be caught, as was done in the case of 58 marine varieties to protect juvenile fish.

Aquaculture will be made more scientific so as to enable the State to achieve self-sufficiency in fish production. The amendments seek to scientifically organise aquaculture methods followed in the State.

An important aim is to check the introduction of foreign species and their marketing and breeding in the State. Breeding of species potentially harmful to local varieties will be checked.

Ornamental varieties

Further, the amendments seek to introduce better controls over the marketing and exhibition of ornamental fishes. No person without a valid licence will be allowed to sell ornamental varieties on an industrial scale or exhibit them for more than 30 days by selling tickets. However, this does not apply to the sale of fish from a production unit or displaying them at homes. Further, the display and sale of banned species will not be allowed.

Regional fisheries management councils and Aquaculture Development Agencies will be formed with fisher representatives as members. Constructions will not be allowed in any notified rivers, backwater stretches, or lakes that obstruct natural flow and fish breeding.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-inland-fisheries-and-aquaculture-act-2010-to-be-amended/article32854434.ece
163,2020/10/14,Slash school fee by 25% this year: child rights panel,"Plaints of denial of education owing to non-payment of fee

The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has asked schools in the State to allow a 25% reduction in the existing fee this year in the wake of COVID-19.

Besides public schools, the direction will be applicable to CBSE and ICSE schools too, a full bench of the commission comprising chairman K.V. Manoj Kumar and members K. Nazeer and C. Vijayakumar has said.

Online classes

The commission’s direction comes on a complaint by parents of students of ACE Public School, Manjeri. Though the school had allowed a relaxation of ₹500 in fee except for the months of June and July, students who did not pay fee were not allowed to take part in online classes, the complaint alleged.

With all sections of society facing difficulties caused by the pandemic, the school management’s argument that fee could not be reduced was not acceptable, the commission said. Parents should pay 25% reduced fee. The school should not deny students who remit the reduced fee the opportunity for education, and the CBSE Regional Director should ensure this, it said.

The commission said private schools had the right to levy fee on students but at least a 25% relaxation was necessary to ensure that education was not disrupted. Many institutions had announced a fee cut on their own. Many complaints of denial of education owing to non-payment of fee had arisen. Following the verdict of the High Court of Kerala that the government could take a policy decision on fixing the fee for CBSE schools, it should issue an order making the fee reduction applicable to them too.

Schools that had allowed a 25% reduction need not grant it again. A decision on doing away with the reduction could be taken once the situation caused by the pandemic changes for the better, the panel said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/slash-school-fee-by-25-this-year-child-rights-panel/article32854217.ece
164,2020/10/14,New discharge policy for COVID-19 patients,"Follow-up test of Category B patients reduced to 10 days

The Health Department has yet again revised the discharge policy for COVID-19 patients, making the discharge criteria uniform for asymptomatic Category A and Category B patients.

The State has, however, taken a conscious decision not to discharge patients without ensuring that they test negative for COVID-19, even when all scientific experts have tried to impress upon the government that this follow-up test is unnecessary and may be avoided as the system is already overburdened.

Available data indicate that persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset. Persons with more severe to critical illness or severe immuno-compromised state are not likely to remain infectious for longer than 20 days after symptom onset.

Category B re-test

If earlier, the first follow-up test for Category B patients before discharge used to be conducted on the 14th day from the onset of symptoms, the test will now be conducted four days earlier, on day 10, just as it is done in the case of asymptomatic or Category A patients.

In case symptoms are persisting even after day 10, the first follow-up test will be conducted for Category A and B patients one day after the resolution of symptoms. They can be discharged if the rapid antigen assay is negative, provided they have completed 10 days since the onset of symptoms; they have had no symptoms in the last three days and if they are clinically stable and not experiencing excessive fatigue or exertional desaturation.

However, if the first follow-up test done on day 10 of onset of symptoms continues to be positive, then the patient will be re-tested repeatedly every alternate day till the test is negative.

In the case of Category C patients, which include patients who have been critically ill or those patients who are immuno-compromised (HIV patients, transplant recipients or those with malignancy), the first follow-up test to determine discharge will continue to be done on the 14th day.

All category of patients after discharge are expected to avoid all non-essential travel and stay away from any social contact, such as public functions, marriages or workplaces for seven days after discharge. They should also take adequate rest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/new-discharge-policy-for-covid-19-patients/article32854208.ece
165,2020/10/14,Kappan welcomes KC(M) faction to LDF,"No discussions held with United Democratic Front over Pala Assembly seat

On a day when the Kerala Congress (M) [KC(M)] led by Jose K. Mani announced its decision to join the Left Democratic Front (LDF), Mani C. Kappan, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator from Pala, extended a wholehearted welcome to the regional party.

Addressing media persons here on Wednesday, Mr. Kappan sought to dismiss rumours about him holding any discussions with the United Democratic Front (UDF) in view of Mr. Mani's entry into the left coalition. The ongoing discussions over the Pala seat were hypothetical as Mr. Mani himself had clarified that the KC(M)'s decision was unconditional.

“The NCP’s position has been consistent with the LDF and my victory in Pala was the collective effort of the coalition workers,” Mr. Kappan said.

Following reports that Mr. Mani demanded the Pala seat during the informal consultations with the LDF, Mr. Kappan had earlier responded that there was no question of giving up the seat to any one and for anything, even for a Rajya Sabha seat. While his position vis-a-vis the Pala seat still remained, it appears to have been tempered on an intervention by the LDF.

Mr. Kappan, who had unsuccessfully contested in Pala against K.M. Mani for three times on a trot, rode on his popularity in the region and the raging factional fight within the KC(M) to emerge victorious during the byelection last year. The election had been necessitated by the death of Mani on April 9 the same year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kappan-welcomes-kcm-faction-to-ldf/article32854126.ece
166,2020/10/14,School reopening should bedecided at district level: IAP,"Students should come in shifts /alternate days, 50 % cut in syllabi mooted

The Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) has recommended that the decision on school reopening in the pandemic times should be taken by each district administration and not at the national or State level.

The proposal figures top among the latest guidelines on school education amidst the COVID-19 scenario drafted by a committee set up by the IAP. Schools can be be reopened only when the local epidemiological parameters are favourable. The district administration has to be equipped with adequate infrastructure and health care facilities and the stakeholders (teachers, students, parents, and support staff) are prepared for the ‘new normal,’ it said.

“The district administration has to ensure that the number of new cases of COVID-19 detected in the district concerned should be steadily decreasing for two weeks preceding the date of school reopening. The number of new cases in the district per lakh population per day should be less than 20 in the past two weeks,” said S. Sachidananda Kamath, former national president of IAP and member of the committee that drafted the guidelines.

The guidelines prescribed that schools should open in batches with older students joining first. The students should be divided and called in different batches, shifts /alternate days and in staggered times. Schools should be ready with the new norms of the infrastructure, training of the staff and health and hygiene facilities.

Suggesting that the academics this year should be made as stress free as possible, Dr. Kamath recommended that the educational boards concerned should undertake 50% trimming of the syllabi for all the subjects of all the classes. “The quantity and portion to be cut should be reviewed and re-addressed from time to time,” he said.

The guidelines said that remote learning (media-based and /or otherwise) should reach the last student to maintain uninterrupted education. The curriculum needs to be revised, with focus on revision and core contents. Informal learning of psychosocial empowerment and daily living skills should be encouraged rather than stressful formal learning, it said.

The committee pointed out that school reopening needs to be considered with utmost care as many studies had found that children remain asymptomatic but carry significant viral load and can potentially spread COVID-19 among the general population.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/school-reopening-should-bedecided-at-district-level-iap/article32854086.ece
167,2020/10/14,Four harbours in Kollam to be renovated,"₹54.56 crore project for harbours at Neendakara, Saktikulangara, Thangassery and Azheekkal

Four harbours in the district will be given a facelift with finance from the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) allocated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).

As part of the ₹54.56 crore project, harbours at Neendakara, Saktikulangara, Thangassery and Azheekkal will be renovated. NABARD has sanctioned ₹32.7 crore for Saktikulangara harbour, while ₹9.5 crore will be spent on reconstructing the buildings at Neendakara harbour. A sum of ₹7.4 crore has been set aside for constructing and extending docking facilities at Azheekkal and ₹4.8 crore will be spent on Thangassery harbour.

The wharf and auction hall at Neendakara will be modernised and geobags will be placed there in order to prevent sedimentation in the harbour.

A new toilet block, approach road, well, overhead water tank, shopping complex and CCTV surveillance will also come up in the harbour. Apart from dredging, Saktikulangara harbour will get a string of new facilities including finger jetty, net mending shed, kiosk, entrance gate and gate house. A compound wall around the harbour will be constructed while parking area and auction hall will be renovated.

An auction hall and 100-meter wharf will be built in Azheekkal harbour to expand landing facilities. The construction of the wharf will be done in such a way as to ensure the safety of fishers and hassle-free fishing. Thangassery harbour will have a modern auction hall, separate building for shops and net mending shed. The entire construction activities will be in accordance with the historical relevance and heritage value of Thangassery.

Ice plant and treatment plant are also included in the project and the harbours are expected to receive ISO certification with the completion of works.

“Maximising export possibilities and increasing market value of various products through branding are other objectives. The renovation works will help in strengthening the marketing network by bringing all the harbours in the district under a single cluster and providing extra cold storage facilities,” said Fisheries Minister J.Mercykutty Amma.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/e1hlsg/article32856931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tvko-Sakthikulagara-harbour,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/four-harbours-in-kollam-to-be-renovated/article32853974.ece
168,2020/10/14,Gold smuggling case: Sivasankar moves Kerala High Court for anticipatory bail,"Former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister says he apprehended his illegal arrest on the basis of an Enforcement Directorate chargesheet before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act

Former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister M. Sivasankar on Wednesday approached the Kerala High Court seeking anticipatory bail in a case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the gold smuggling case.

In his petition, he said that he apprehended his illegal arrest on the basis of an ED chargesheet in connection with the case before a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Though the petitioner was questioned for more than 90 hours by different agencies, no incriminating materials could be gathered by them to implicate him in the alleged crime as was evident from the fact that the petitioner had not been arraigned as an accused in the final report already filed.

He pointed out that the ED had levelled “baseless allegations” against him to indicate that he had some connection with the alleged smuggling activities. In fact, he had conceded the fact of his acquaintance with Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the smuggling case, while she was working as secretary to UAE Consulate General. The petitioner was holding a key post in the government and he had occasion to contact the Consulate General in connection with his duties. In fact, the petitioner came to know about the fact that Ms. Suresh and her friends were involved in the case and that they used to bring gold to India by misusing the office of Consulate General only after the consignment was seized by the customs.

The specific case of the prosecution is that the smuggling activities started in November 2019. However, Whatsapp messages between petitioner and his Chartered Accountant that had happened well before this date were “needlessly annexed to create a false impression” that the petitioner had some involvement in the activities committed by the prime accused in this crime. The inclusion of these details in the chargesheet was misleading. Details of these Whatsapp communications were unrelated to the alleged crime, and mentioning them without specifying dates were misleading, the IAS officer said

He feared that the investigating agency would be forced to arrest him to avoid criticism from the media.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/h9wrg6/article32817763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09-PTI-KL-GOLGI77RGD5I3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gold-smuggling-case-sivasankar-moves-kerala-high-court-for-anticipatory-bail/article32851938.ece
169,2020/10/14,KC(M) Mani faction to join LDF,"Ending weeks of uncertainty over the political position of the Kerala Congress (M) faction led by Jose K. Mani, the party here on Wednesday announced its decision to align with the Left Democratic Front (LDF).

Announcing the decision after an emergency parliamentary party meeting held here in the morning, Mr. Mani also declared that he would step down as the Rajya Sabha member. Barring a few months of association at the Kottayam District Panchayat in 2017, the party's decision to join the LDF marks a major shift in its political course after four decades.

Elaborating on the decision to join the LDF, Mr. Mani asserted that the switching of sides was unconditional. At the same time, the assembly seat of Pala would always remain ‘the most intimate in his heart’ as far as the party was concerned.

“What we have declared now is the party's decision and this has come as unconditional. The discussions with the LDF will kick off from now onwards and our association with the LDF is going to change the political landscape of Kerala forever,” Mr. Mani replied, to a query on the terms of his alignment with the left parties.

On the occasion, he also launched a scathing attack on the Congress and UDF (United Democratic Front) for its alleged betrayal of the party founder by K.M. Mani, also regarded as a founder of the UDF. “A few within the Congress unleashed a personal attack on me and extended support to P.J. Joseph for hijacking the KC(M). As a party founded on the principles laid down by K.M. Mani, we could not stand this for long and hence decided to leave the UDF,” Mr. Mani added.

Regarding the decision to step down as the Rajya Sabha member, Mr. Mani said the decision was in line with the principles of political morality. The move, however, has come as a surprise to many as the regional party had never responded to a demand by the UDF chairman and senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala asking Mr. Mani to step down as MP had he intended to switch sides.

Responding to Mr. Mani’s decision, P.J. Joseph, leader of the rival KC(M) faction, said Mr. Mani was joining hands with the group that had hunted down his father. He said, “Mr. Mani left the UDF on his own by raising false allegations and now he looks to join those who prevented his father from presenting the state budget. Worse still, he is joining them without any understanding over the Pala and Kanjirappally seats.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/6tpefe/article32556982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08kthun03--KeraG3Q7OBNN53jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kcm-mani-faction-to-join-ldf/article32851475.ece

171,2020/10/14,Vayalkilikal burn Pinarayi and Gadkari in effigy,"Protest against bypass through Keezhattoor

Vayalkilikal, a collective of villagers at Keezhattoor here, burnt Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Union Surface Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari in effigy in protest against the plans to construct a bypass through the village.

Vayalkilikal leader Suresh Keezhattoor said the protests against the construction of the Keezhatoor bypass would continue. He added that the CPI(M) was taking a stand that betrayed the farmers’ struggles.

The protest comes against the backdrop of Mr. Gadkari and Mr. Vijayan inaugurating national highway development work.

Mr. Keezhattoor said the construction of the bypass needed to be stopped and Tuesday’s protest was just the beginning of agitations.

He said the detailed project report for the modernisation of the national highway from Kasaragod to Vengalam (Kozhikode) was prepared as per a contract awarded to AECOM in February 2016. Though the project was for a four-lane road, the NHAI issued tenders for a six-lane road.

He said that nod for construction was given without assessing the environmental impact. Also, the project had not yet received the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) approvals. He also questioned the contract issued for construction of the section from Neeleswaram to Taliparamba (up to the Kuttikol river) to Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Ltd.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vayalkilikal-burn-pinarayi-and-gadkari-in-effigy/article32848644.ece

Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma has said that the government is planning to enhance production of indigenous fish varieties in inland waterbodies.

Speaking after inaugurating the peninsular carp hatchery at Thalapuzha in Wayanad district, the first such initiative in the country, on Tuesday, Ms. Mercykutty Amma said the project envisaged conservation and enrichment of indigenous carp variety of fish.

174,2020/10/14,Wayanad to intensify steps to contain COVID-19 spread among tribes people,"While the COVID-19 situation in the State continues to be critical, the Wayanad administration is gearing up to intensify steps to contain the spread of the disease among the tribal population in the district.

Close to 5,000 COVID-19 cases had been reported in the district so far, of which 156 were of tribespeople testing positive, District Collector Adeela Abdulla told The Hindu. “We have directed the local administrative bodies, Health and Scheduled Tribes Development Departments to adopt all possible steps to tackle the spread of the pandemic in tribal hamlets,” said Ms. Abdulla, adding that better coordination and strong field-level activities were needed.

The highest number of cases were reported among the 31-40 age group and then the 41-50 age group, according to District Medical Officer R. Renuka. Most of the cases were reported in tribal hamlets under the Meenangadi, Periya and Vengapally health centres, she said.

175,2020/10/14,The flip side of e-learning,"How teachers and parents can help children cope with the stress of online classes

The novel coronavirus has put students across different age groups in jeopardy. From disrupted sleep patterns to increased screen time to rising complaints about headaches, the shift to digital classrooms has raised concerns about its longevity. One significant result is the effect on a child’s sleep habits, which influences physical and emotional wellness. A restless human brain can lead to depletion in the pre-frontal cortex, which ordinarily keeps our amygdala, the emotional region of the brain.

Without the structure and face-to-face communication with the teachers, some students may find it hard to focus on their studies. At home, there may be interruptions from younger kids or household chores that must be finished. It tends to be hard to create a peaceful learning environment.

E-learning is also known to make students feel lonely, as they miss being with their peers. Loneliness can rapidly lead to higher suicides rates. Absence of social connections found in the traditional classrooms also makes it difficult for them to cope. Companionship of their peers gives them a lot of support.

Causes and effects

E-learning has forced students to reset the way they learn and adapt to new techniques overnight. They are more stressed while studying from home. This pressure and nervousness is a consequence of them not feeling in charge of the circumstances. A few analysts have noticed that increased use of technology can even change a child’s nature. A youngster who invests an excessive amount of energy in virtual technology is less inclined to develop compelling social skills to communicate in a room full of people.

Apart from slow mental development, lack of physical activities can also growth. A child’s sensory and motor growth are not adjusted to the inactive and intellectually tumultuous nature of technology. Parents must be cautious and aware when their child’s motor and sensory development fail to achieve the desired milestones.

In such a situation, both parents and teachers can help the child’s psychological well-being. Parents can implement a routine that involves specific times for resting, eating, and working out. Family dinners are a time for parents to put away their own gadgets and talk to their children. Ask them how they’re doing, watch for any change in behaviour, and build up conversations frequently with one another. During virtual sessions with students, teachers can urge them to do a quick exercise before focusing on their work.

More health education interventions are required in India to expand attention on this issue.

176,2020/10/14,Panel told to visit sensitive coastal areas in T.N.,"Study necessary before implementing coastal protection measures: EAC

The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Ministry of Environment has suggested that a sub-committee visit sensitive coastal areas of Tamil Nadu for examination before coastal protection measures envisaged under the Comprehensive Shoreline Protection Management Plan are implemented.

The EAC also said that the shoreline change maps prepared by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) and the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) be used as the basis for implementing any shore protection schemes in the State, as suggested by a team of experts from IIT-Madras in its report to the EAC.

“The detailed shore protection measures should be as per CRZ Notification 2011 and subsequent amendments thereon. Implications of Coastal Economic Zone (CEZ) development under Sagarmala needs to be taken care suitably while preparing detailed coastal protection measures,” the report had said.

The team had also suggested that the government of Tamil Nadu circulate the plan to neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and union territory of Puducherry as implementation of the plan might have implications there as well. The EAC in May 2019 had sought comments and suggestions from the neighbouring States and wanted the T.N. government to make them available.

The EAC was informed at a recent meeting that the Tamil Nadu government in July this year had requested the MoEF to approve the plan pending comments from the neighbouring States. The EAC said the Ministry may send a reminder to these neighbouring States to provide their views within three months, on or before December 2020 and posted the matter for further consideration after these comments are received.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/panel-told-to-visit-sensitive-coastal-areas-in-tn/article32857005.ece

179,2020/10/14,10-year-old elephant found dead near Manimuthar dam,"Deputy director of KMTR’s Ambasamudram division said that the organs of the animal were intact and the pathologist, who was part of the post-mortem team, alone could identify the type of infection that had apparently caused the death.

A 10-year-old female elephant, which was spotted roaming along the periphery of the forest near Manimuthar dam in the Western Ghats for the couple of days, was found dead in a private farm at South Paappaankulam on Wednesday.

When the farmers of Pottal and Therkku Paappaankulam near Manimuthar dam in the district spotted the elephant roaming close to their now empty ranches near the reservoir on the lap of the Western Ghats a couple of days ago, they alerted the Kalakkad – Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR) officials.

After assessing the animal’s condition from close quarters, the KMTR team placed food stuffed with medicines in the areas where the elephant was moving around.

Since the elephant could not walk fast and did not take food or water, the animal’s condition deteriorated further. It was found dead in the farm of agriculturist Sudalaikannu of Therkku Paappaankulam on Wednesday.

On getting information, the KMTR officials including deputy director of KMTR’s Ambasamudram division Kommu Omkaram arrived at the spot with forest veterinarian Manoharan to conduct on-the-spot post-mortem to ascertain the cause of the death.

Mr. Omkaram told The Hindu that a team of KMTR personnel had been deployed in Pottal and Therkku Paappaankulam area on getting information about the elephant sluggishly moving near the now empty paddy fields. Though the food stuffed with medicines was placed at several points, the animal did not take any food.

“There is no possibility of starvation death as food and water is abundantly available in this region. We, during the post-mortem, could see the elephant, having infection in the mouth, had consumed palm fruits, but could not digest it. The infection in the digestive system might have caused the death. Anyway, we can come to a conclusion only after getting the post-mortem report,” said Mr. Omkaram.

He added that the organs of the animal were intact and the pathologist, who was part of the post-mortem team, alone could identify the type of infection that had apparently caused the death.

The deputy director also ruled out the chances of the animal being poisoned for having invaded into the fields, saying that all the paddy fields in this region were empty now as harvest had been completed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/9h5v12/article32853072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14IN-ELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/10-year-old-elephant-found-dead-near-manimuthar-dam/article32853073.ece

The Hindu had last week reported that the Tamil Nadu government has approached the Centre for approving the extension of the services of the Chief Secretary yet again.

The 1985-batch IAS officer assumed charge as the Chief Secretary on June 30, 2019 and was set to retire in July this year initially. Following a request from the Tamil Nadu government, the Union Department of Personnel & Training had in June extended his services till October 31 this year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/6bks3o/article32852721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14OCTTH--SHANMUGAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-chief-secretary-gets-another-three-month-extension/article32852722.ece
183,2020/10/14,₹33.73 lakh seized from TNPCB official’s premises in Vellore,"A case has been registered and further investigations are on

184,2020/10/14,Madras High Court dismisses as withdrawn Rajinikanth’s plea against property tax demand for marriage hall,"Actor files memo after judge warns of imposing costs for moving court without giving time to officials to consider his plea for tax remission

The Madras High Court on Wednesday dismissed as withdrawn a writ petition filed by actor Rajinikanth, 70, against the demand of property tax to the tune of ₹6.5 lakh by the Greater Chennai Corporation for his Raghavendra Mandapam (marriage hall) located in Kodambakkam.

Justice Anita Sumanth accepted a memo filed by the actor’s counsel agreeing to withdraw the case.

The memo was filed after the judge warned of imposing costs on the petitioner for rushing to the court without giving sufficient time for the officials to consider his plea for tax remission.

‘Wastage of judicial time’

The judge told the counsel that she had been telling time and again to all litigants before the court not to waste judicial time by filing cases immediately after sending representations to officials concerned. She said litigants must send reminders as well to the officials, if required.

Justice Sumanth further said the actor should have pursued the matter with the Corporation on the basis of a representation made by him, seeking “vacancy remission” under Section 105 of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act of 1919, and convinced the officials about his eligibility.

In his affidavit, Mr. Rajinikanth had stated that he was the owner of Raghavendra Mandapam and he had been paying property tax regularly for the hall. The second half-yearly tax for 2019-20 was paid on February 14.

Thereafter, the pandemic broke out and there was a nationwide lockdown since March 24. The Centre extended the lockdown for quite some time and, thereafter, the State government continued it as far as Tamil Nadu was concerned.

Consequently, Raghavendra Mandapam was not let out to anyone since March 24 and it remained vacant. Advance payments received for bookings after March 24 had also been returned to the people concerned on the basis of the instructions issued by the State government, he stated.

Despite all these developments, the actor received a tax invoice from the Greater Chennai Corporation on September 10, asking him to pay ₹6,50,660 towards property tax for the marriage hall for the half-yearly period from April to September.

On September 23, the actor sent a “notice” to the Corporation, claiming that he was entitled to vacancy remission on property tax. He also cited Section 105 of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act of 1919 to support his claim.

The particular Section provides for remission of tax if a building has remained vacant for more than 30 days, he said, insisting that the benefit be accorded to him. Stating that his plea was not considered, he approached the court seeking a direction to dispose of his “notice”.

He also urged the court to restrain the Corporation from levying 2% penalty, with interest, for the non-payment of property tax before October 15.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nup4gt/article30738073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04FEBTH-RAJINI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/madras-hc-dismisses-as-withdrawn-rajinikanths-plea-against-property-tax-demand-for-marriage-hall/article32852300.ece
185,2020/10/14,"TN schools will not open now, CM will decide on reopening, says Minister","School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan said that a report on reopening of schools will be prepared by the Education, Revenue and Health Departments and submitted to the Chief Minister

﻿

Schools in Tamil Nadu will not be reopened now, and any decision about re-opening of schools will be taken by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan in Vellore on Tuesday.

The Minister was speaking at an event held in Vellore to distribute renewal and recognition extension certificates to 275 matriculation and government-aided schools in Vellore, Ranipet, Tirupathur and Tiruvannamalai districts.

The Minister said that before schools reopened in Andhra Pradesh, a few students had tested positive for COVID-19. Hence he said that a report on reopening of schools will be prepared by the Education, Revenue and Health Departments and submitted to the Chief Minister and he will take a decision on the same. “When schools reopen, safety measures will be ensured and they will be monitored,” he said.

Stating that nearly 174 of the 180 questions in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) were taken from the Tamil Nadu State Board textbooks, he emphasised the quality of the syllabus prepared by the State. “In Tamil Nadu, students have to just switch on their televisions and they can learn through Kalvi channels. They don’t need mobile phones for online learning. A total of 15.5 lakh students have joined State-run schools after this government took over. This is because our education methods have changed for the better,” he added.

The Minister also pointed out that over 1,000 students are undergoing free CA courses and over 500 auditors are teaching them. “We will be introducing smart classes in 7,600 schools and smart boards will be introduced. Atal Tinkering Labs will be started in 982 schools in the coming year,” he added.

The Minister added that the demand for the creation of Gudiyatham as an education district is being discussed with the Chief Minister.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bvqx1i/article32852104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14OCTTH--Sengottjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-schools-will-not-open-now-cm-will-decide-on-reopening-says-minister/article32852105.ece
186,2020/10/14,Supreme Court upholds 2011 Madras HC order on T.N. elephant corridor,"Judgment comes on 32 appeals filed by resorts/private land owners, including Bollywood actor Mithun Chakraborty

The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the Tamil Nadu government’s authority to notify an ‘elephant corridor’ and protect the migratory path of the animals through the Nilgiri biosphere reserve.

The reserve is the largest protected forest area in India, spanning across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala.

A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde said it is the State’s duty to protect a “keystone species” like elephants, which are immensely important to the environment.

The corridor is situated in the ecologically fragile Sigur plateau, which connects the Western and the Eastern Ghats and sustains elephant populations and their genetic diversity. It has the Nilgiri hills on its southwestern side and the Moyar river valley on its northeastern side. The elephants cross the plateau in search of food and water depending on the monsoon.

“Elephant corridors allow elephants to continue their nomadic mode of survival, despite shrinking forest cover, by facilitating travel between distinct forest habitats... these corridors play a crucial role in sustaining wildlife by reducing the impact of habitat isolation,” Justice S. Abdul Nazeer, who wrote the judgment, observed.

The Supreme Court judgment came on 32 appeals filed by resorts/private land owners, including Bollywood actor Mithun Chakraborty, against a Madras High Court decision of July 2011. The High Court had confirmed a State government order of August 2010, notifying the elephant corridor.

The court set up a three-member inquiry committee of former Madras HC judge, Justice K. Venkatraman; Ajay Desai, consultant to World Wide Fund for Nature-India; and Praveen Bhargava, trustee of Wildlife First. Appellants can approach the committee in four months with their complaints against the action taken by the Nilgiris Collector, which included sealing of their buildings, and allegations about the “arbitrary variance in acreage of the elephant corridor”.

The court had made its empathy for the pachyderms clear even during the hearing of the case.

“The elephant is a gentleman and man should give way for the elephant,” Chief Justice Bobde had said before reserving the case for judgment on January 22.

The court had taken serious note of a report filed by amicus curiae, advocate A.D.N. Rao, to seal or demolish 821 buildings, except tribal houses, within the areas marked as elephant corridor by the Tamil Nadu government. Mr. Rao had suggested a rehabilitation plan for 186 households belonging to Scheduled Caste, Backward Caste and Most Backward Caste people.

Chief Justice Bobde had refused to go into individual grievances raised by private land owners against the August 2010 notification under the Tamil Nadu Preservation of Private Forest Act of 1949.

When some of the resort owners had proferred their view that elephant and man do co-exist, Chief Justice Bobde had wryly replied that, “It is because the elephant is a gentleman… Why do you have to go inside the forest?”

In 2011, the High Court had held that the government was authorised by the Centre's ‘Project Elephant’ to earmark the corridor since there was no impediment in the Wildlife Protection Act.

It had held that the State government’s action to identify the corridor was in complete obligation to its duties under Article 51-A(g) of the Constitution, which said it was the duty of every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment, including wildlife.

The Supreme Court appreciated the efforts of advocate ‘Elephant’ Rajendran, whose petition under ‘In Defence of Environment and Animals’ sought protection for the free movement of elephants.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mwswmp/article32851717.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/supreme-court-upholds-2011-madras-high-court-order-on-tn-elephant-corridor/article32851718.ece
187,2020/10/14,﻿Die-hard CSK fan in Cuddalore district paints his house yellow,"Chennai Super Kings captain M.S. Dhoni’s picture is painted on the front, while the CSK logo has been painted on the side walls of the house, belonging to ardent fan R. Gopikrishnan

In an explicit display of his passion and love towards Chennai Super Kings and its captain M.S. Dhoni, a die-hard fan from Arangur near Thittakudi in Cuddalore district has painted his house yellow, with the logo of CSK.

R. Gopikrishnan, a Forex trader working in Dubai, has been a die-hard fan of Dhoni since 2008. Though he was staying close to the stadium in Dubai where the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches are being hosted, Mr. Gopikrishnan could not watch the matches at the stadium due to the pandemic and the ban on spectators.

“I realised that I will not be able to cheer Dhoni and the Home Team during the matches. I returned to my hometown, Thittakudi, dejected,” he told The Hindu. “I was renovating my house and that’s when I decided to paint my house in yellow with the logo of CSK. My parents, who are also cricket fans, agreed immediately,” Mr. Gopikrishnan said.

“A number of fans were criticising and making adverse remarks about Dhoni for his performance in the ongoing IPL. With a view to ensuring that all the negative comments were nullified and to spread positivity, I decided to paint the house,” he said.

Mr. Goprikrishnan contacted his friends and searched the district to find an artist who could paint the house. The ardent fan also downloaded photos of Dhoni and the CSK logo from the Internet and handed them over to Selvaraj, an artist from Thittakudi.

Mr. Gopikrishnan spent ₹1.5 lakh to paint the house in yellow. Dhoni’s photos were painted on the front, while the CSK logo has been painted on the side walls with the message ‘#Home of Dhoni Fan’ at the entrance. The work was completed in two days and has now grabbed the attention of local residents.

Chennai Super Kings took to Twitter to share pictures of the house. “Super Fan Gopi Krishnan and his family in Arangur, Tamil Nadu call their residence Home of Dhoni fan and rightly so. A super duper tribute that fills our hearts with #yellove”, the tweet said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/86t4m0/article32850764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14OCTTH--Dhoni,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/die-hard-csk-fan-in-cuddalore-district-paints-his-house-yellow/article32850765.ece
188,2020/10/14,"Is it possible to extend OBC medical, dental seat quota in Tamil Nadu this year, SC asks Centre","In July, the Madras High Court had ruled that the reservation increase will be implemented next year

The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked lawyers for the National Medical Commission (NMC) and the Centre to find out whether reservation benefits can be extended to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in medical and dental seats contributed to the All-India Quota (AIQ) by State government-run colleges in Tamil Nadu this year itself.

“Is it possible to get reservation applied this year? We want you to get instructions on whether there is a real difficulty in getting it done this year,” Justice L. Nageswara Rao, heading a three-judge Bench, asked advocate Gaurav Sharma for NMC and Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh for the Centre. The court then scheduled a hearing for October 15.

The development came even as the Madras High Court, in July, directed the Centre to form a committee and fix the percentage and other terms of OBC reservation from next year. The High Court had not wanted to disturb the admission process this year. The Tamil Nadu government and political parties across the spectrum, from ruling AIADMK, represented by advocate Balaji Srinivasan, to the Opposition DMK, represented by senior advocate P. Wilson, had appealed to the apex court.

Interim relief

As the hearing began, senior advocates V. Giri and M. Yogesh Kanna, for Tamil Nadu government, prayed for some interim relief. Mr. Giri conveyed a sense of immediacy, pointing out that the results for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) could be published any day now.

He submitted that the High Court had agreed on all points in favour of granting 69% reservation (50% reservation for OBCs, 18% for SCs and 1% for STs) as per the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and of appointments or posts in the Services under the State) Act of 1993. He said the 69% reservation would benefit the depressed classes in the State.

He referred to Lok Sabha documents submitted by Mr. Wilson in which the Health Ministry had conveyed its “pro-active stand” in favour of “State-specific” reservation in AIQ seats. Mr. Wilson submitted that the future of several hundreds of students were at stake. He said the high court-directed committee was formed on September 7. “Till today they are not able to take a decision,” he submitted.

Justice Rao suggested adjourning the case after the Dussehra holidays to give the committee enough time to decide. But Mr. Wilson intervened strongly, saying the matter may become infructuous because of NEET results.

“Without prejudice to the rights of the parties, the Centre can give at least 27% of reservations implemented in the Centre-run educational institutions to the State-surrendered AIQ seats as a temporary arrangement till the High Court-directed committee decides the issue,” Mr. Wilson said.

In his turn, Mr. Singh responded the committee had met on September 22. Tamil Nadu, which is a member, was asked to submit its proposal on the reservation benefits. The State representative is yet to revert. He highlighted that it would be difficult to implement “State-specific” reservations. “Multiple States will come requesting seats for their OBCs,” Mr. Singh contended. Moreover, he said the apex court had placed an embargo of 50% on overall reservation while Tamil Nadu's was at 69% as per the 1993 Act.

At this point, Mr. Srinivasan countered pointedly that the Centre could not make these contentions as it had not even appealed the High Court verdict in the first place.

Justice Rao acknowledged the objection raised by Mr. Srinivasan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/qkvk7e/article18314412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THHUMANCHAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/is-it-possible-to-extend-obc-medical-dental-seat-quota-in-tn-this-year-sc-asks-centre/article32848925.ece
189,2020/10/14,Raw drug repository coming up at National Institute of Siddha,"It will serve as a library and museum to store database

A Regional Raw Drug Repository (RRDR) for Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani medicines for the southern plateau region is being set up at the National Institute of Siddha, Chennai. A five-year project, the repository will serve as a one-stop library for raw drugs available in this part of the country.

Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH and Minister of State for Defence Shripad Yesso Naik inaugurated the RRDR through a virtual platform on Tuesday. The establishment of RRDRs was a component of the Union government’s National AYUSH Mission. The Ministry of AYUSH, through the National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB), has initiated the establishment of the National Raw Drug Repository and Regional Raw Drug Repositories.

As a part of this, the NMPB has identified the National Institute of Siddha (NIS) as the lead institute, with the Regional Research Institute of Unani Medicine (RRIUM), Chennai, and Siddha Central Research Institute (SCRI), Chennai, as the collaborating institutes. This RRDR would be involved in the collection, documentation and authentication of raw drugs gathered largely from the respective agro-climatic region, says a press release.

‘Library-cum-museum’

“This repository will serve as a library-cum-museum and house database of raw drugs of Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha in the southern region. Take ‘tulsi’ for instance. For a complete study of ‘tulsi’, we will travel and collect ‘tulsi’ from various areas, study the biochemical ingredients, structure and other details. This repository will provide A to Z details of a drug, comprising all scientific data, under one roof,” National Institute of Siddha Director R. Meenakumari said.

She added: “In the last three months, we have collected 30 to 40 raw drugs, and are going to collect samples of 500 more raw drugs for this repository. This will then be standardised, while DNA and fingerprinting will be done and monograph readied. The repository includes a virtual library. Researchers will be able to do multi-disciplinary studies with the database available at the repository.”

She will head the project as principal investigator, while Zaheer Ahmed, head of institute, RRIUM, and Satyarajeswaran, director in-charge, SCRI, RRDR (southern plateau), will be the co-investigators.

Though most of the raw drugs are commonly available, there is a lack of scientific documentation that makes research on these medicines difficult.

Easy availability of authentic scientific data of raw drugs will promote research on the medicines belonging to the AYUSH system, the release said. The RRDR will not only act as a collection centre of raw drugs available and used in the southern region but also as an accredited reference library for authentication of raw drugs and establishment of standard protocols and keys for authentication of raw drugs used in herbal industries.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/raw-drug-repository-coming-up-at-national-institute-of-siddha/article32848936.ece
190,2020/10/14,Judge should not have doubted functioning of vigilance wing: CJ,"‘Action taken against 39 officers, staff’

The first Division Bench of the Madras High Court led by its Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi has said that a single judge of the court should have not doubted the functioning of the vigilance wing in State judiciary without ascertaining any facts on that count.

The Bench, also comprising Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, said the vigilance wing of the High Court was very much alive to its responsibilities and it had initiated disciplinary action against as many as 39 judicial officers and court staff in the last one year.

While dismissing a writ petition filed by advocate B. Sathishkumar with false averments that the High Court’s Registrar (Vigilance) R. Poornima had not passed higher secondary examinations, the judges referred to observations made by the single judge at its Madurai Bench.

The single judge had said: “Undoubtedly, judiciary has to strengthen its vigilance wing and the prevailing vigilance system in the judiciary is insufficient to crush the corrupt practices. Frequent surprise visits and inspection in the judicial departments and premises are needed.

“It is pertinent to remind that many former Chief Justices of India had lamented that judiciary is not exempted from corrupt practices. Unfortunately, efficient measures are yet to be taken to deal with many kinds of corrupt practices in the judicial system.

‘Right spirit’

“If these observations are taken in a right spirit by the administrators, then alone we can see the development of our great nation. Thus, the administrator must have a heart and spirit to take the issues in a right manner.”

Disapproving of such observations, the first Division Bench said the High Court had been responding to every challenging situation on the administrative side to the best of its capacity and ability and it was evident from the statistics on action initiated so far.

“The public at large, therefore, need not be sounded on the capacity of the administrators to have a heart and a spirit to take effective steps to keep the stream of justice running pure. A general perception on any impulse may cause a doubt but it appears to be far from reality,” the Bench said.

Apart from imposing a cost of ₹5 lakh on the advocate who had filed the case against the Registrar (Vigilance), initiating criminal contempt proceedings against him and suspending him from practising law, the court decided to deal with the issue on its administrative side too.

The matter would be dealt with on the administrative side too “in order to keep the administration free from impediments that are likely to cause damage to the system on account of unnecessary publicity or veiled efforts made by either insiders or outsiders.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/x5vbw6/article32786982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7THHC-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/judge-should-not-have-doubted-functioning-of-vigilance-wing-cj/article32848935.ece

When times are dominated by talk of the pandemic, here is a story on a veteran scribe who turns a centenarian. Chennai resident G.N. Srinivasan will be celebrating his centenary year on Wednesday.

Having served as a reporter with The Hindu, his family members and friends have put together a souvenir containing news clippings of important events he had covered and a felicitation note from N. Ravi, Chairman of Kasturi and Sons Ltd.

Mr. Srinivasan, fondly called GNS among the reporting fraternity, joined The Hindu in 1953 and served the organisation for 30 years. During his stint, he covered the Assembly Council meetings, the Legislature, the Secretariat and political meetings attended by important leaders.

According to his daughter, Sandhya Ravi Mohan, GNS covered the proceedings of the Sarkaria Commission — a Commission appointed by the Central government in 1976 to inquire into the allegations of corruption against former Chief Minister and DMK leader M. Karunanidhi. His balanced coverage of the Sarkaria Commission was appreciated by all, she recalled.

Having completed his graduation in economics, GNS started his career in the Indian Express as a stenographer and later became a reporter. He joined The Hindu based on his reporting of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s visit to Chennai in 1953.

After his retirement from The Hindu, he served as a legal correspondent with the Press Trust of India for five years.

V. Jayanth, former Managing Editor of The Hindu, lauded GNS for helping groom youngsters in covering the Legislative Council meetings.

The test positivity rate touched a new low of 6.30% in over three months, while case fatality rate declined to 1.77%. The recovery rate was 83.94%.

Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi said there should be no let-up in the enforcement of safety norms in spite of the fall in the test positivity rate. The system of random sampling could be taken as part of survey of state of health and as a form of feedback on the ground situation, she said.

Ms. Bedi, who reviewed the situation with officials, had given instructions to get the LED screen of the Tourism Department at the beach repaired and use it for running awareness messages.

193,2020/10/14,Avoid crowded places for shopping: Health Secy.,"‘People must not forget about precautions just because cases are declining’

Until a vaccine against COVID-19 becomes available, it is essential that people follow safety precautions when they are outdoors and avoid crowded places for Deepavali shopping, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said here on Tuesday.

Addressing journalists while inspecting the COVID-19 speciality wing of the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), he said people must not forget precautions because COVID-19 cases were on the decline across the State. “By not following safety precautions, people are not only fooling themselves, but can affect others too.”

Though the government was constantly creating awareness of the precautions, there was a need for a behavioural change among the public. “By following all safety measures it can be ensured that there is a further decline in the cases...,” he said.

The Health Secretary, along with Collector T.G. Vinay and GRH Dean J. Sangumani, interacted with the patients at the COVID-19 wing.

Later, Dr. Radhakrishnan told The Hindu that the main objective of entering the COVID-19 ward with personal protective equipment (PPE) was to acknowledge the efforts of doctors and paramedical workers who had been working hard for the past seven months, treating COVID-19 patients. “Being in the frontline with the doctors for 40 minutes while wearing PPE will help to boost their morale,” he said.

The team interacted with patients with varying severity of infection, he said. “This will also provide psychosocial support to the patients. It is also to emphasise that there is no need to stigmatise COVID-19 patients,” he said.

The Health Secretary inspected the newly installed oxygen tank at the hospital with a capacity of 20 kl. He said oxygen capacity was increased at tertiary, taluk and non-taluk hospitals across the State.

The positive cases were declining in the State, even after 80,000-95,000 RT-PCR tests were done every day. While all districts had a positivity rate below 10%, it was below 5% in 18 districts, he said. “But the public must cooperate by following safety precautions to further bring down the positivity rate.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/14eea3/article32848928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14RADHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/avoid-crowded-places-for-shopping-health-secy/article32848929.ece
194,2020/10/14,Welfare board soon: Minister,"Work towards formation of the board was under way, he says

An announcement regarding the creation of a new welfare board for members of light music orchestra groups can be expected in a couple of weeks, said Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture Minister Ma Foi K. Pandiarajan.

Addressing a virtual conference organised by the Tamil Nadu Progressive Writers and Artistes Association (TNPWAA) to discuss the livelihood issues of performing artistes, Mr. Pandiarajan said that the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister had already announced the government’s intent to form the board and work towards its formation was under way.

“Before the COVID-19 pandemic began, we had around 38,000 members registered with the board. Now, it has increased to nearly 50,000. We are planning to increase it to one lakh by the end of this year,” he said.

Thoothukudi Lok Sabha MP and DMK women’s wing secretary M.K. Kanimozhi, who spoke at the conference, highlighted that the welfare board for folk artistes was formed when the DMK was in power. She spoke about the need to bring folk performances to urban audiences.

Aadhavan Dheetchanya, general secretary, TNPWAA, presented the conference’s report and demands, which included organising annual festivals in every district for folk art forms, providing medical assistance for the artistes, introducing folk art in schools and engaging folk artistes for the government’s outreach programmes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/welfare-board-soon-minister/article32848926.ece

196,2020/10/14,Dalit girl from Anitha’s village to pursue free medical education,"She will go to Davao Medical Education School Foundation in the Philippines, thanks to a private sponsor

Three years after S. Anitha of Kuzhumur in Ariyalur district ended her life, unable to get a MBBS seat through the National Eligibility- cum-Entrance Test (NEET), the dream of another girl hailing from the village of studying medicine has become a reality.

Daughter of daily wage earners Shankar and Dhanalakshmi, S. Soundarya will fly to the Philippines to pursue medical education, free of cost, at the Davao Medical Education School Foundation, thanks to a private sponsor. Besides the expenditure for her education, her boarding, food and transport expenses during the period of her study will be sponsored by Transworld Educare Private Limited.

Soundarya’s ambition to become a doctor came to be known to Anitha’s brother S.A Manirathnam, who is running a charitable trust in memory of his sister at the village. “The medical institute’s office at Mahabalipuram near Chennai, which wanted to help a poor girl pursue medicine in memory of Anitha, got in touch with me. That was when I told them about Soundarya’s ambition and her poor economic background,” said Mr. Manirathnam, managing trustee of Dr. Anitha Memorial Charitable Trust.

A representative from the institute in Chennai came to Kuzhumur a few days ago and interacted with Mr. Manirathnam and Ms. Soundarya to ascertain the girl’s wish.

Ms. Soundarya, who had completed Plus Two in a higher secondary school at Kuzhumur with 410 out of 600 marks, said she was sceptical about her chance of studying medicine owing to her economic background and she might be at a disadvantage because of the NEET. Soundarya’s family runs on the wages earned by her parents and her elder brother, who works in Chennai as a labourer after completing Plus Two. Her elder sister is pursuing electrical and electronics engineering at a private college near Tiruchi.

“I had almost decided to take up law or some other degree course when this opportunity came knocking at my door,” she said, thanking Mr. Manirathnam for the help and motivation. “I see an Anitha in Soundarya and want her dream of becoming a doctor is realised,” Mr. Manirathnam said.

A ‘Free Education Certificate’ from David K Pillai, founder and CEO, Transworld Educare Private Limited, was handed over to Ms. Soundarya a few days ago. Mr. Manirathnam said the trust that he runs has been extending financial support to a girl student from Jayamkondam in Ariyalur district, who is studying medicine, and to a few others.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dalit-girl-from-anithas-village-to-pursue-free-medical-education/article32848678.ece
197,2020/10/14,"Release Keeladi excavation reports without any delay, urges Ramadoss","Only one report has been released so far, says PMK leader

PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Tuesday said that the reports on archaeological excavations carried out in Keeladi in the State should be released without any delay.

In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said that while excavations have been completed in six phases, only one report has so far been released.

“The sixth phase of excavations happened in September last year. Forty-seven pits were dug up in four places and they have found child skeletons, skulls, pots and pot shells, totalling around 2,430 items,” he said.

Dr. Ramadoss said the fourth phase of excavations have proved that the Tamil civilisation is 2,600 years old. “The three excavations that happened before this and two phases of excavations that happened after this would prove it,” he said.

The report on the fifth phase of excavations which was completed in 2019 should have been released this year, he said.

“While the COVID-19 pandemic is being cited as the reason for the delay, the excavations done in three phases in 2015 and 2017 by the Central government are yet to be released. The report of the excavations done by Tamil Nadu’s archaeological department in 2018 has only been released,” he said.

Dr. Ramadoss said the Centre should ensure that reports on the first three excavations should be released without any delay and reports on the fifth and sixth phase of excavations should be released in the next few months.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/release-keeladi-excavation-reports-without-any-delay-urges-ramadoss/article32848657.ece
198,2020/10/14,HC refrains from suspending stay order in breach of privilege case,"Court allows Assembly Secretary and Privileges Committee to approach single judge for vacating stay

The first Division Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday refrained from suspending an order of interim stay passed by a single judge on September 24 restraining Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly’s Committee of Privileges from proceeding against DMK president M.K. Stalin and 17 other MLAs of his party in the gutkha sachets display issue.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, however, granted liberty to the Assembly Secretary as well as the Privileges Committee to move an application before the single judge to vacate the stay. The liberty was granted pursuant to writ appeals preferred by them against the single judge’s stay order.

The Bench made it clear that the present appeals against the stay order would not stand in the way of the single judge considering applications for vacating the stay.

Simultaneously, it also ordered notices, returnable by four weeks, to Mr. Stalin and other MLAs on the individual writ appeals filed by the Assembly Secretary and the Privileges Committee.

Advocate General Vijay Narayan, representing the Assembly Secretary, brought it to the notice of the Bench that show cause notices were issued to the DMK MLAs for breach of the privileges of the House in 2017.

In the same breath, the Bench had permitted the Committee of Privileges to issue fresh notices.

Without appreciating that fact, the single judge had stayed the fresh notices in September this year when they were challenged by the MLAs, the A-G said.

On his part, senior counsel A.L. Somayaji, representing the Privileges Committee, said the single judge should not have even entertained the writ petitions filed by the DMK MLAs challenging the fresh show cause notices since no pure question of law had been raised in them. He requested the Division Bench to order suspension of the single judge’s stay order.

However, wondering whether such a course would be appropriate without hearing the other side, the Chief Justice permitted the appellants to move the single judge once again with a plea to vacate the stay.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-refrains-from-suspending-stay-order-in-favour-of-dmk-mlas-in-breach-of-privilege-case/article32848620.ece

201,2020/10/14,‘Two and a Half Men’ star Conchata Ferrell dies at 77,"The actor was a a three-time Emmy nominee, who starred as the no-nonsense housekeeper Berta in the sitcom

Veteran stage and film actor Conchata Ferrell, best known for starring as the no-nonsense housekeeper Berta in the sitcom “Two and a Half Men”, has passed away. She was 77.

Ferrell, a three-time Emmy nominee, died Monday at Sherman Oaks Hospital of complications following a cardiac arrest, reported Entertainment Weekly.

Besides the two nominations for “Two and a Half Men”, in which she appeared in over 200 episodes, the actor also earned a nod for playing Susan Bloom on the legal drama “LA Law“.

Some of her other notable credits on the small screen include “ER”, “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”, and “Grace and Frankie“.

In films, Ferrell got her first starring role in 1979 drama “Heartland”, and followed it with titles like “Network”, “Mystic Pizza”, “Erin Brockovich”, and “Edward Scissorhands”.

She was a known name in theatre and gained success off-Broadway as an original member of the Circle Repertory Theatre.

“Berta, your housekeeping was a tad suspect, your ‘people’ keeping was perfect,” he said.

Lear called Ferrell “one of the dearest people and most amazing talents I have ever worked with“.

202,2020/10/14,Singer Seema Sreekumar turns director with ‘Oru Canadian Diary’,"A psychological thriller, the film follows the quest of a Malayali youngster as he tries to locate his partner

Settled in Canada since 2002, Seema says over a Zoom call that it was the panoramic Canadian landscape that ignited the filmmaker in her. Instead of shooting a music video or a documentary, she decided to go ahead with a film, Oru Canadian Diary, which unfolds in Canada but for a song and a few scenes shot at Kanhangad in Kasaragod district in Kerala. Incidentally, Kanhangad is where Seema’s family hails from.

Scripted by her and produced under the banner of Sreem Productions, the film stars newcomers Paul Paulose, Simran and Pooja Sebastian, all of whom she selected through auditions.

“It is a romantic thriller, a suspense-filled film about two youngsters from Kerala who migrate to Canada. Sara, the female protagonist, reaches Canada and keeps in touch with Surya. However, a few days later, the calls stop. Once Surya reaches Toronto, he begins his search to locate Sara,” narrates Seema, working as regional manager of Malayala Mayooram TV, a Malayalam channel in Toronto.

Lyrics by Sivakumar Vaarikkara and Sreethi have been composed by music director K A Latheef. Playback singers Unni Menon and Madhu Balakrishnan also feature in the film.

“The shooting in Canada featured Canadian actors as well but the work was completed without any hassles. It was only in Kerala that we faced a few issues but it was all solved peacefully,” she says with a smile.

With dialogues in Malayalam and English, Oru Canadian Diary is an addition to the number of films that explore the lives of the Malayali diaspora.

Actor-director Renji Panicker released the first look teaser of the film on his Facebook page on October 14.

Seema hopes to release the film on an OTT platform and is raring to do more films.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5glyba/article32853208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmseema1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/singer-seema-sreekumar-turns-director-with-oru-canadian-diary/article32853209.ece
203,2020/10/14,"'Halal Love Story' is about life, love, faith and friendship, says Indrajith","The gifted actor plays Shereef, the lead in the film directed by 'Sudani from Nigeria' director Zakariya Mohammed

Versatile actor Indrajith returns to the screen as Shereef in Zakariya Mohammed’s Halal Love Story after movie-goers last saw him as the taciturn and brusque Dr Baburaj with a heart of gold in Aashiq Abu’s blockbuster Virus.

Premièring on Amazon Prime on October 15, Halal Love Story has Indrajith playing a middle-class guy with cinema in his dreams. The actor sounds gung-ho as he talks on the phone from Kochi about his character and some of the exciting projects that he was working in before the pandemic struck.

Indrajith and Grace Antony on the set of Halal Love Story, which releases on Amazon on October 15 | Photo Credit: special arrangement

Indrajith says he was unable to interact much with the media in 2019 as he was neck-deep in work in different locations. In addition to Halal Love Story, in which he plays a character that is new in his repertoire, he acted in Srinath Rajendran’s Kurup with Dulquer Salmaan, with Nivin Pauly in Rajeev Ravi’s Thuramukham, and Jeetu Joseph’s Ram and so on.

“Shooting was going on for some films while some others were in the post-production stage when the lockdown came. All work had to be put on hold. The shooting of Ram, for instance, has been completed in India and the next schedule is in London. We are not sure when we will able to travel for work,” says Indrajith.

However, putting aside speculations about the future, Indrajith would rather talk about Shereef. “Halal Love Story is a film of our times. Rooted in the soil, it is about a group of youngsters who try to make a film that is keeping in with their religious beliefs. That is when they realise the challenges they have to overcome. There is a lot of humour but it is organic and woven into the landscape of the story,” says the actor.

Shereef, hailing from a conservative family, plunges into the efforts to make a film that stays within the boundaries prescribed by his faith. However, conflicts arise in plenty as a group of professionals try to make a film with an amateur group of film lovers and actors who want to ensure that the film is ‘Halal’, that what is permissible in their faith. “It is about life, love, faith and friendship,” he says.

The team decides that since their budget is limited, they would go in for a tele-film and approach Joju George, enacting an aspiring director who is not orthodox in his views.

“There are personal and professional conflicts as they try to resolve issues that crop up during the filmmaking. The professionals want their work to be done well and have no patience for the sentiments of members of the cultural organisation that is keen on making a film to reach out to the people. The solutions to overcome or work around those issues often lead to unexpected outcomes. For instance, Shereef is more of an enthusiastic actor than a good one but they are forced to cast him because of certain compulsions,” says Indrajith, unwilling to divulge more about the story.

He adds that the dialect is quite different from what he has done so far in his career. “Fortunately, many of the crew members, including Zakariya and Muhsin Parari, the scenarist, belong to Malappuram and all I had to do was listen to them carefully,” explains Indrajith.

Talented Grace Antony acts as Indrajith’s pair, Suhara. Amid the planned chaos of a mise-en-scene in Halal Love Story, Shereef, Suhara and Taufeeq (Sharaf U Dheen) along with the other characters gain a new understanding of life and themselves.

“Shereef is a layered character. He loves acting and is an enthusiastic actor in street plays and the like put up by the cultural organisation be belongs to. So he jumps at the opportunity to act in the film that is being shot at his place. Through the discussions about the film and its shooting, we get close to the characters and their moral dilemmas,” adds Indrajith.

Like others in the industry, he is also impatiently waiting for the day when the film industry starts rolling in earnest without any hurdles.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vq9791/article32852187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmIndrajith2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/halal-love-story-is-about-life-love-faith-and-friendship-says-actor-indrajith/article32852189.ece
204,2020/10/14,Why filmmaker Karthik Subbaraj is more excited about anthologies,"Karthik Subbaraj and actor Bobby Simha discuss their upcoming anthology 'Putham Pudhu Kaalai', which brings together five of Tamil cinema’s finest directors

Of all incidents that could spark an idea for a film, it was a theft that did the trick for filmmaker Karthik Subbaraj. The victim in the incident was actor Bobby Simha, whose office was targeted by thieves.

While there is no clear picture on the nature of losses incurred by the actor, Karthik, however, wrote a story based on the incident, which eventually developed into a short film set to stream on Amazon Prime from October 16 as part of an anthology titled Putham Pudhu Kaalai.

The film brings together filmmakers Karthik Subbaraj, Rajiv Menon, Suhasini Maniratnam, Gautham Menon and Sudha Kongara: a first-of-its-kind initiative as regards Tamil cinema.

Anthology love

“I’m always interested in anthologies,” says Karthik, who has previously been a part of two other anthologies: Bench Talkies and Aviyal.

Karthik Subbaraj | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Connecting over Zoom alongside Bobby, Karthik notes that a short film allows space for a filmmaker to experiment with ideas not possible in a feature film format. “Amazon [Prime] approached us with the idea of making these shorts but the rider was that the stories should have a common thread of hope or a new beginning. All five shorts gives hope to the characters as well as the audience towards the end,” he says.

Bobby chips in: “Watching an anthology is a unique experience. Instead of watching one story unfold, the audience gets to watch five different short stories, in different genres.”

Karthik’s short is titled Miracle. “We are all still hoping that COVID-19 miraculously goes away one morning and someone will say ‘We are back to normal’. This film is a story about similar characters... of people who yearn for that miracle,” Karthik says.

Usual suspects Also starring actors Muthukumar, Sharath Ravi and Ezhil, Miracle’s cinematography is by Shreyaas Krishna. The latter handled the camera for Jagame Thandhiram, which counts Bobby Simha among its cast. Karthik shot for Miracle with a limited crew following relaxation of shooting restrictions.

Prior to the pandemic outbreak, Karthik Subbaraj was one of the first among mainstream stakeholders of Tamil cinema to expand his portfolio into indie films, launching a separate arm under his banner, Stone Bench Productions, to help fund quality small budget films.

Even with corporate behemoths like Amazon venturing into the same space, Karthik sees no threat to his investment but rather looks at it as an encouraging sign. “With OTT platforms, there is a lot of interest in producing anthologies. I know more such projects have already been commissioned. I think it is a good thing,” says Karthik, adding, “When we brought Bench Talkies and Aviyal to the theatres, we only acquired previously completed short films and presented them as an anthology, unlike Putham Pudhu Kaalai.”

Unique situation

Though their association stretches back well over a decade, Bobby remarks that he approaches every project with Karthik Subbaraj as his first film.

“The fear and discipline is still there. I am his close friend but he is eagle-eyed and smells out any lag in performances,” he laughs. “Working on a film with Karthik is definitely a learning experience, especially with Miracle, it felt like we rolled back the years,” Bobby adds.

Questions still remain over a potential OTT release for Jagame Thandhiram, Karthik Subbaraj’s upcoming film starring Dhanush. But the filmmaker prefers to play coy.

“If theatres open by October-end, then it is very good news for the cinema industry,” he says. On the film’s release prospects, he adds: “It is the producer’s choice. Stone Bench produced Penguin, which we gave to Amazon though it was made for a theatrical release. We are in a stage where we have to survive with what we have.”

A documentary about singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes, titled “In Wonder”, is slated to be released on Netflix on November 23.

It will start streaming days ahead of the release of his fourth studio album “Wonder” on December 4, reported Variety.

The feature-length documentary, helmed by veteran music video director Grant Singer, is an intimate look at Mendes’ life and journey.

“In Wonder” will likely feature footage of Mendes from his 2019 self-titled world tour that took him across the North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. It was a special event selection at the Toronto International Film Festival.

“Been working on this documentary for so long & am so excited to finally share it with you all (sic)” Mendes wrote sharing the poster on the film on Instagram Tuesday.

206,2020/10/14,‘The West Wing’ reunion: A mission to get Americans to the polls,"Aaron Sorkin’s show ended its seven-year run in 2006 after winning more than 20 Emmy Awards

Fourteen years after television political drama “The West Wing” shut down its White House set, the show is back with its idealized version of a U.S. president and a mission to get Americans to the polls on Nov. 3 to choose a real one.

Martin Sheen, who played the liberal-leaning U.S. President Jed Bartlet on the show, reunites with fictional White House staffers portrayed by Bradley Whitford, Allison Janney, Rob Lowe, Dule Hill, Janel Maloney and Richard Schiff for a one-off special to promote voting.

“A West Wing Special to Benefit When We All Vote,” to be broadcast on HBO Max on Thursday, is a staged theatrical performance of an episode from 2002, called “Hartsfield’s Landing,” in which the cerebral Bartlet plays chess with his aides while awaiting the results of a state primary election and dealing with a brewing crisis over Taiwan.

“West Wing” creator Aaron Sorkin said it was chosen “because the episode ended with a feeling that we wanted the audience to have. A feeling about voting.”

While Sorkin wrote no updates to the script, the likes of former President Bill Clinton, former first lady Michelle Obama and “Hamilton” musical creator Lin-Manuel Miranda will appear during commercial breaks “giving information about voting, knocking down some untruths about voting, and doing it in their own style,” Sorkin said.

Sorkin said he was a firm believer in the influential power of movies and television in shaping ideas, but said “The West Wing” would be no different if he was writing it in today’s political environment.

“What the show was always about was a workplace drama set in a very interesting workplace,” Sorkin said.

“In our popular culture, our elected leaders are portrayed either as Machiavellian or as dolts. So I thought, what if there is a show where these people are every bit as confident and dedicated as doctors and nurses on a hospital show or the lawyers on a legal drama.”

“The West Wing” ended its seven-year run in 2006 after winning more than 20 Emmy Awards. The special was shot as a play in an empty theater in Los Angeles under coronavirus guidelines.

“This Is Us” star Sterling K. Brown takes the role of chief of staff Leo McGarry following the death in 2005 of actor John Spencer.

Actor Anya Taylor-Joy, best known for starring in M Night Shyamalan’s psychological thriller “The Split” and its follow-up “Glass”, has been tapped to headline “Furiosa”, a spin-off of George Miller’s multiple Oscar winning hit “Mad Max: Fury Road“.

In the new feature, Taylor-Joy will play the title role of the renegade, originally played by Charlize Theron in 2015’s “Fury Road”, which was set in a post-Apocalyptic era where resources like water and oil are extremely scarce and precious.

According to Deadline, the stand-alone film will reveal the origins of Furiosa, long before she teamed up with Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) in “Fury Road”.

“Extraction” star Chris Hemsworth and “Watchmen” star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II will also star in the upcoming project.

Miller will direct, co-write and produce with his longtime Oscar-nominated producing partner Doug Mitchell. Miller’s own Australian-based Kennedy Miller Mitchell banner will produce.

208,2020/10/14,Heavy loss in Nalgonda,"A total of 1,12, 425 acres affected

Just when farmers from undivided Nalgonda were ready to reap a bumper crop, thanks to adequate rainfall and irrigation in the Kharif season, Tuesday’s torrential rain and flood came as a curse.

Preliminary damage assessment by respective Agriculture departments state that a total of 1,12, 425 acres was affected.

In Nalgonda alone, the damage was reported in 49,744 acres. Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri was second with 43,794 acres and Suryapet at 18,887 acres. Paddy and cotton were predominantly cultivated following the State’s regulated farming system, except for red gram in 211 acres in Suryapet.

Crops were damaged, according to officials, mainly due to water-logging, inundation of standing crops and sand casting. Over 11,263 farmers were affected in Nalgonda alone.

But, situation in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri, which recorded extremely heavy rainfall (more than 20.45 cm) such as in Valigonda, Choutuppal and Ramannapet, the ‘categories of damage’ are concerning.

Harvested paddy heaps were damaged in 100 acres in Bhongir and 19 acres in Ramannapet. The preliminary report confirms that 43,675 acres in 14 mandals have crops in submerged condition. Collectors of the three districts along with MLAs and officials conducted the procurement preparedness meet here in Nalgonda only on Monday.

It was stated that paddy, in about 10 lakh acres, in undivided Nalgonda would exceed last season’s record procurement by witnessing nearly 15 lakh metric tonnes now.

Farmers across the districts were visibly depressed when leaders visited the villages. A few farmers, believing that the weather condition had normalised from the clear skies, went about their work by draining the soaked paddy and spreading it to dry.

53,000 ryots hit

In Khammam, the heavy rainfall over the last three days left large tracts of agricultural fields waterlogged, damaging cotton and paddy crops spread over 75,364 acres in 345 villages. More than 53,358 farmers were affected, said preliminary estimates.

Paddy and cotton crops were damaged on a little over 38,111 acres and 37,227 acres respectively, sources said.

Affected mandals were Sattupalli, Vemsoor, Madhira and Bonakal mandals.

In Bhadradri-Kothagudem, crops including paddy, cotton, groundnut and chilli were damaged in an estimated 8313 acres in the tribal dominated district.

A little over 4000 farmers suffered crop losses owing to the rain devastation, official sources said.

209,2020/10/14,Rain leaves trail of destruction in Telangana,"Standing crops damaged to huge extent; roads too bear brunt

Although the depression over Telangana has moved west-north-westwards and was lying over north interior Karnataka and adjoining areas of Maharashtra and Telangana providing some breather to the State, the heavy downpour during the 24-hour period till 8.30 am on Wednesday had its effect by throwing normal life out of gear across the State.

Several areas in the southern parts of the city continue to remain in darkness even on Wednesday night after the power supply was stopped to them as a measure of precaution mostly due to inundation of residential areas and power installations from Tuesday evening, although it has been restored in many other areas.

According to the authorities of Southern Power Distribution Company of Telangana Ltd (TSSPDCL), they have restored power supply from all the 15 sub-stations in the city that were affected due to heavy rain on Tuesday but power supply in the areas served by 15 feeders and some distribution transformers were yet to be restored. Besides, 63 out of 312 electrical poles that were damaged due to tree fall, washing away and other reasons were also yet to be attended.

Officials of the Southern Discom explained that power supply under a total of 686 feeders was affected but it was restored under 671 of them already as there has been respite from rain and heavy wind since Wednesday morning. Power supply to residential colonies and apartments which were inundated but yet to be cleared of rainwater completely was also yet to be restored.

Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Transco and Genco D. Prabhakar Rao appraised Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao that power utilities were on high alert across the State following heavy rains and flash floods and the restoration work was completed wherever rainwater has receded or has been cleared.

Power utilities have suffered huge damage/loss at several places in the State and the staff were attending to the work despite the adverse weather conditions, Mr. Rao explained to the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister instructed the CMD to keep people informed about the situation of breakdown in supply and restoration work on regular basis.

The power generation and transmission utilities were on high alert through the night on Tuesday as the demand slipped to little over 2,700 MW from the regular of about 6,000 MW even during rains. It was the lowest ever demand recorded since formation of the State, the authorities said adding that the thermal stations were completely backed down to maintain the grid frequency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hyderabad-plunges-into-darkness/article32855722.ece

As the date of polling is fast approaching in Dubbaka, the political parties are focusing on youth in the constituency. There are about 1.97 lakh voters out of whom about 87,000 are youths. They are going to play a key role in the election campaign as well as on the day of polling in bringing voters to the polling booths.

“Youth are the strength of the party. We will welcome them and give them right position in the party,” said Mr. Harish Rao while inviting some youths into the party recently.

“Youth should come into the (Congress) party and must be in the forefront in fighting against the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and its anti-people policies. We welcome T Karunakar Reddy into the party,” said Malkagiri Lok Sabha member A. Revanth Reddy while meeting Karunakar Reddy at his residence in Mirdoddi on Monday.

213,2020/10/14,"Calcutta HC quashes proceedings against Babul Supriyo, but calls his remarks against Mahua Moitra defamatory","The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday quashed criminal proceedings against Union Minister Babul Surpriyo on the basis of charge sheet filed by Kolkata Police in an FIR lodged by Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra on grounds that “charge-sheet does not disclose commission of any offence under Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code.” However, the court, observed that utterance by the Minister was “defamatory statement within the meaning of Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code” and added that Ms Moitra was “at liberty to take any action, according to law, if available to her against the petitioner before the appropriate forum and in such case”.

The case pertains to developments in January 2017, during a debate on a news channel when Mr. Supriyo, the BJP MP from Asansol, said, “Mohua, are you on mohua?” alluding to the liquor drunk in tribal areas. Ms Moitra, who was then a Trinamool Congress MLA, later filed a complaint against Mr. Supriyo.

Justice Bibek Chaudhuri rejected the arguments by Mr. Supriyo’s counsel that the statement was an “accidental slip of words”, not intended to defame the opposite party. “It is expected from a representative of the people that he must be courteous in his behaviour, dignified in his manners and cautious on his words spoken by him,” the order said.

In the 32-page order Justice Chaudhuri said that by making “such defamatory statement to a woman, the petitioner prima facie, not only humiliated dignity and honour of a woman, but also violated his constitutional oath. If doubt is raised in the mind of people from the utterances made by the petitioner that the at the relevant point of time she was drunken and intoxicated…” adding that the “utterance made by the petitioner was defamatory statement within the meaning of Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code”.

Justice Chaudhuri also added that constitutional mandate under Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles of State policy that “dignity of woman must be protected and freedom of speech and expression enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) is subject to reasonable restrictions and one of such restrictions is penal provision against defamation.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/calcutta-hc-quashes-proceedings-against-babul-supriyo-but-calls-his-remarks-against-mahua-moitra-defamatory/article32856947.ece

216,2020/10/14,"In Nagaland, car gifted by father used as free ambulance","After Hongnao Konyak’s free service, Mon town now has three ambulances, with one dedicated for COVID-19 patients

Former Nagaland school teacher Hamshen Konyak had a piece of advice for his son after handing over the keys of a brand new SUV bought from his retirement benefits three years ago: “Put this gift to good use.”

The son, 39-year-old Hongnao Konyak, did better. He turned the SUV into an ambulance to ferry the sick and their attendants for more than three months during the COVID-19 lockdown phases.

His 100-day service ended in August after Mon, the headquarters of Mon district about 330 km from State capital Kohima, received the first of its three ambulances from the government and a Gurugram-based NGO.

Mr. Konyak, a social worker and a member of the district unit of the Naga People’s Front, was not just a “self-styled driver” of a “makeshift ambulance” when the district had none.

He often became the attendant of an unaccompanied patient and an interpreter for villagers who spoke different dialects of the Konyak tribal language that non-Konyak doctors and medical staff did not understand. He also organised blood donors, bringing them to the District Hospital Mon (DHM) and dropping them back home.

One such beneficiary was the brother of Methna Konyak, a haemophilia (a genetic disorder that affects blood-clotting) patient who needed five units of blood of A+ group.

“It would have been difficult to get blood for my brother without Hongnao’s help. A person who uses his own vehicle, burns fuel and helps the sick get treatment in time during difficult times is a rarity,” the patient’s brother said.

“Hongnao was a massive help during the lockdown when patients could come from faraway villages because of the lockdown,” said DHM’s Medical Superintendent Khrielasanuo.

“I could not let my car be parked idly when in-patients of the district hospital, designated a COVID-19 hospital, had to be relocated. I met district authorities with the proposal of providing round-the-clock ambulance service with my car,” Mr. Konyak told The Hindu from Mon.

He ferried patients to and from various towns and villages in the district as well as hospitals in adjoining Assam. “I must have transported some 150 people, including pregnant woman for delivery. The DHM asked me to keep a record but I did not do this for the records, neither for getting anything in return,” he said.

Only once did he receive some help — a gift of 50 litres of diesel from a fuel outlet owner in Mon town for enabling his “service to mankind”.

After his 100-day service, he stayed a month at the Mon Covid Control Room voluntarily monitoring quarantine, recovery, and other health centres.

Mon’s District Magistrate Thavaseelan K. said the district administration did not waste time in permitting Mr. Konyak to ferry non-COVID-19 patients but by adhering to all safety protocols.

“We are grateful to people like him and organisations such as Konyak Union for helping the administration during the toughest phases of the pandemic,” he said.

A week ago, the State government announced that DHM — one of Nagaland’s cleanest hospitals — would be upgraded to a medical college.

The Nagaland government has called all civil society groups for a consultative meet in Kohima on Thursday to discuss the ongoing peace talks and the political issue.

The National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isaak-Muivah) and the seven Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) that are in talks with the government of India for signing the final peace deal have not been invited to the meeting.

An official said this meeting will only focus on the civil society groups which includes church bodies, prominent persons, Naga HoHo and others.

Assam Minister and North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convenor Himanta Biswa Sarma told reporters on October 13 in Guwahati, “On October 15, Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio has called a meeting with all the social organisations.... Now people of Nagaland know the position of the government of India. A series of meetings have been conducted and now we know each other’s position. Things will be much better now. We are not negotiating the agreement. We are there only to see that the boat is sailing. I don’t think there will be any issue in the northeastern States as the government of India is taking all the States into confidence.”

The Naga talks hit a rough weather after the NSCN(IM) leadership refused to hold any dialogue with Naga interlocutor R.N. Ravi who is also Nagaland’s Governor. A team of Intelligence Bureau officials have been deputed to hold forth the discussions with the NSCN(IM). Mr. Ravi and the NSCN(IM) had signed a framework agreement on August 3, 2015 in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The NSCN(IM) has been demanding a separate constitution and flag for the Nagas and the assimilation of all Naga-inhabited areas in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur.

The scheme is aimed at providing livelihood to women in rural areas.

Sushant Singh Rajput’s sister Shweta Singh Kirti’s social media accounts, including Twitter and Instagram pages, have been deactivated, four months after the actor’s death. Shweta was at the forefront of #JusticeForSSR campaign since the demise of Rajput on June 14.

It is, however, uncertain whether Shweta herself deactivated her accounts as she did not announce quitting social media before her profiles disappeared. The deactivation has left many Rajput fans puzzled, who took to Twitter sharing screenshots of the same.

Rajput’s death ignited discussions on the nepotistic nature of the industry and its gate-keeping attitude, but took an entirely different angle after the actor’s family filed an FIR against his girlfriend, actor Rhea Chakraborty.

The family of the late actor, known for films such as Kai Po Che!, MS Dhoni: The Untold Story and Chhichhore, accused Chakraborty of abetting Rajput’s death, laundering his money and isolating him from his family.

The case, which was initially investigated by the Mumbai police, was later handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation while the Enforcement Directorate and the Narcotics Control Bureau also got involved.

It advised the Sarbananda Sonowal government to focus on providing quality learning instead.

A few days ago, Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the government would close down all the madrasas as “religious teachings cannot be carried out with government funds in a secular country”.

Earlier this month, the government set in motion a process of transferring 148 contractual teachers from some madrasas to schools under general secondary education.

“We will not allow the madrasas to be victims of divisive, religious politics. The government should focus on development of such institutions and reverse the decision to close down the madrasas or face a stir,” said association president Rajab Ali.

The association asked the government to restore the Directorate of Madrasa Education that was merged with the Directorate of Secondary Education three years ago.

The association said there were 1,002 madrasas in the State, out of which 801 were run by the government. These institutions have a total of some 15,000 teachers.

Dr. Sarma had said that all State-run madrasas will be converted into regular schools or in certain cases, teachers will be transferred to State-run schools and the madrasas shut down. He also said that a notification in this regard would be issued in November.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wont-allow-govt-madrasas-to-be-closed-teachers-body/article32853355.ece

National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah and vice-president Omar Abdullah on Wednesday met Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti, released after 14 months on Tuesday, at her residence and extended an invitation to hold a meeting of all the signatories of the Gupkar Declaration, a pact to fight for the restoration of J&K’s special status.

The Abdullahs, once considered arch rivals of the Muftis, arrived at the official residence of Ms. Mufti at Gupkar on Wednesday afternoon. Party sources said the leaders discussed the situation in Kashmir and “agreed on the need to put up a joint front”.

Abdullah Junior, who described the meeting as a courtesy call, said: “It was only after the Supreme Court’s intervention that Ms. Mufti was released. Our visit today has nothing political about it. We met to find out how she was doing.”

Ms. Mufti thanked the Abdullahs. “It gave me courage listening to him [Dr. Abdullah]. I am sure together we all can change things for the better, she said.

In an indicator of cementing relations between the two major regional players, Mr. Abdullah said Ms. Mufti has accepted an invitation to attend the meeting of the Gupkar Declaration at his residence around 4 p.m. on Thursday.

“All the signatories of the Declaration will be meeting. The future course of action will be decided jointly,” Mr. Abdullah said.

The Declaration was signed by six political parties, including Congress, on August 4, 2019, just a day before the abrogation of J&K’s special status. It called for a joint fight to “safeguard J&K’s special status, Article 370 and 35A”.

Peoples Conference chief Sajad Lone, a signatory of the Declaration, also met Ms. Mufti on Wednesday evening.

Mehbooba toughens stand

In an audio uploaded online, Ms. Mufti, toughening her stand, said the struggle will continue to get back what “the Delhi Darbar has snatched away by unconstitutional and undemocratic means” and sought resolution of the Kashmir issue.

“Everything the Delhi Darbar snatched away by unconstitutional and undemocratic means has to be got back. People also need to keep struggling for the solution of Jammu and Kashmir, which has led to sacrificing thousands of lives,” Ms. Mufti said.

Ms. Mufti, 61, said the abrogation of Article-370 “had been hurting her heart and soul during every moment of her detention”.

Terming August 5, 2019 a “black day”, Ms. Mufti said: “No one among us will forget the humiliation of the day Article 370 was abrogated. No one among us can ever forget the robbery and the insult.”

She said the “path ahead won’t be easy but I believe that our courage and determination will be our companion in walking this path”. She also demanded “immediate release of everyone from J&K who are languishing in various jails of the country”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fin4pg/article32853587.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gupkarjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gupkar-declaration-farooq-abdullah-convenes-meeting-on-october-15/article32853298.ece
223,2020/10/14,COVID-19: Maharashtra directs authorities to hold quasi-judicial proceedings online,"Govt. decision follows PIL by RTI activists led by former Chief Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi and others

After a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking the resumption of quasi-judicial administrative hearings and proceedings through video-conferencing was filed in the Bombay High Court recently by a group of Right to Information (RTI) activists led by former Chief Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government has issued instructions to authorities to permit the conduct of such proceedings online.

A notification issued late on Tuesday by the General Administration Department (GAD) said: “The government has instructed all Additional Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries/Secretaries and Heads of the Departments/Public Authorities to use video-conferencing for conducting virtual hearings in respect of proceedings under the diverse statutes applicable to such public authorities as well as for conducting hearing of first appeals under the Right to Information Act. This will facilitate the dispensation of justice speedily without compromising the health and safety of parties in the current times.’’

Against the backdrop of the raging pandemic in Maharashtra, a group of noted RTI activists led by Mr. Gandhi, Vijay Kumbhar, founder of city-based RTI Katta — a forum for discussions on access to information under the RTI Act — and Vivek Velankar, founder, “Sajag Nagrik Manch”, had requested the State government to conduct the first hearings of RTI appeals through video conferencing.

As it did not elicit any response, the PIL was filed through Advocate Sunil Ahya in August. All petitioners are part of Mr. Kumbhar’s RTI Katta.

The PIL urged the State to direct authorities to provide “all information under the provisions of the RTI Act in a softcopy through a digital electronic medium such as e-mail, WhatsApp unless otherwise specifically requested by an applicant to provide it in any other form and to provide such digital electronic information under a digital signature certification of having provided that information under the RTI Act.”

Mr. Gandhi said the challenges occasioned by the outbreak of COVID-19 have to be addressed while preserving the constitutional commitment to ensuring the delivery of, and access to justice, to those who seek it.

“Given that modern technology has enabled courts to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the administration of justice, we had urged the State to direct public authorities to resume conducting quasi-judicial administrative proceedings and hear first RTI appeals online. After we did not receive any response, we went ahead with the PIL. The Bombay High Court had asked the State government to file an affidavit stating what procedure it would take in this regard so that we, the petitioners, would not have any scope to lodge a complaint. However, before filing its affidavit, the State government asked all the authorities to hold hearings through video conferencing,” said Mr. Kumbhar, welcoming the State’s decision.

He said this decision will have a far-reaching impact on Maharashtra’s administrative functioning.

“This will not only speed up work but also save time, labour and money of both the administration and the citizens. Similarly, online operations will also help increase transparency,” Mr. Kumbhar observed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/v7xlb9/article32853269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAILESHGANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-maharashtra-directs-authorities-to-hold-quasi-judicial-proceedings-online/article32853270.ece
224,2020/10/14,Delete ineligible names: NRC official tells Assam district heads,"Order seeks removal of ‘declared foreigners’, ‘doubtful voters’ from citizens’ list.

Assam’s district heads have been asked to submit the list of ineligible people whose names have been included in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) published in August 2019. They have also been told to write speaking orders for deletion of such names from the list of citizens.

In a letter to every Deputy Commissioner and district registrar of citizen registration on October 13, State NRC Coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma said some names of ineligible people belonging to the “categories of DF/DV/PFT along with their descendants have found entry to the NRC”.

The DF, DV and PFT stand for “declared foreigner”, “doubtful voter” and “pending in Foreigners’ Tribunal”.

Mr. Sarma pointed out that the local registrars of citizen registration had prepared and published the supplementary list of names after disposal of claims and objections while the “Registrar General of India is yet to publish the final NRC as per Clause 7 of the Schedule of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003”.

He cited other clauses of the same Rules necessitating verification of names of such persons and recording of the reasons for their inclusion or exclusion.

“As such, you are requested to write speaking orders for deletion of such names... after specifically ascertaining the identity of the person. The verification would mandatorily require the correct identity of the person so that no ambiguity arises in future,” the letter said.

A speaking order mentions the reasons for leaving out people’s names from the final NRC. Based on such an order, the NRC authority issues a rejection slip to an ineligible person.

“You are, therefore, requested to submit the list of such persons who are not eligible for having their names in the NRC along with speaking order justifying reasons for each case for necessary action for deletion of such names,” Mr. Sarma wrote.

He also said a software application for submission of reviewed results of such persons along with a mechanism of the freshly written scanned speaking orders will be rolled out shortly.

More than 19 lakh people of 3.3 crore applicants were excluded from the final NRC. Those left out would have to appeal to the Foreigners’ Tribunals within 120 days of receiving the rejection slip from the NRC authority.

The police in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, on Wednesday said they have arrested a man for allegedly throwing acid of the faces of three minor sisters when they were sleeping at their house in their village in Gonda district.

A Tanishq jewellery outlet in Gujarat’s Gandhidham in Kutch district recently put up a note on its door, apologising to the Hindu community in the district over the brand’s controversial TV ad that has since been withdrawn but was shared widely on social media platforms, making it among the top trending topics on internet.

The handwritten note in Gujarati put up at the showroom also condemned the TV commercial, which sought to promote the brand’s new jewellery range Ekatvam.

“We apologise to the Hindu community of Kutch on the shameful advertisement of Tanishq aired in the media,” the handwritten note read.

It was pasted at the entrance of the outlet on October 12 and has since been removed.

Photos of the apology note have gone viral on social media.

The showroom manager and local police rubbished media reports that the showroom was attacked by some people angry with the Tanishq advertisement.

“No such attack has occurred. It’s fake news,” said Kutch range IG J.R. Mothalia. On request from the Tanishq outlet manager, the police have provided security. Patrolling in the area has been stepped up after a few threat calls to the showroom, Kutch Police said.

The TV commercial withdrawn by the Tanishq, a Tata group company, featured a Muslim family preparing for an upcoming baby shower for their Hindu daughter-in-law.

228,2020/10/14,"As Durga Puja nears, Kolkata gears up to ‘eat in’","Amid COVID-19 restrictions, concepts of ‘cloud kitchen’ and ‘home chef’ have gained popularity

Food delivery is set to be one of the biggest — if not the biggest — business this Durga Puja in Kolkata, where the concepts of ‘cloud kitchen’ and ‘home chef’ have gained overnight popularity due to the restrictions forced by COVID-19.

A cloud kitchen is one where food is prepared not to be served on the premises but for takeaway; in the period following the lockdown most restaurants, including popular ones, have been functioning as one. Home chefs are those who deliver home-cooked food, and their number in Kolkata has spiralled over the past few months, their popularity spreading word of mouth, as many people still haven’t mustered the courage to eat out.

They are all bracing to meet the pressure during Durga Puja, which, in Kolkata, is more about food than religious rituals. “This year Durga Puja will be about ‘eating in’ instead of ‘eating out.’ People will stay home or meet at a friend’s place and order food,” said brand strategist Luna Chatterjee.

“With the growing popularity of apps like Nanighar, it is quite clear that people will prefer to have food delivered instead of queuing up at restaurants. Peerless Hotel is arranging to home-deliver even their signature Bhuribhoj platter (an extensive spread meant to grow a potbelly),” Ms. Chatterjee said.

With ‘eating in’ becoming the new normal, and with online payments becoming easier than ever, more and more people who take pride in their cooking are turning into home chefs. “I have a knack for cooking, and it was my [hotelier] daughter who nudged me into this business. She said I was wasting my talent,” said Srabani Mukherjee, a retired hotelier herself, who recently launched Soul Kitchen and has just released her Puja menu.

Baking tea cakes

On Sunday, food blogger Ranjini Guha, whose day job is to teach history at a college, also formally launched herself as a home chef: she will be baking tea cakes on order. “The primary idea was to help a couple of young women earn something extra because they are finding it hard to run families due to the lockdown. Also, parents are facing a constant demand for snacks from kids who are now home and find online classes tedious,” Ms. Guha said.

Ishani Priyadarshini, who runs the popular restaurant SurFire: The Coastal Cafe, is also making arrangements to home-deliver Kerala’s Thalassery mutton and chicken biryani, which are among her signature dishes, besides some of the popular Bengali fare. “I would ask people to stay away from crowds. This is not the time to queue up outside restaurants,” she said.

Essential services

Every Durga Puja, one views people providing essential services — such as policemen and doctors — with pity and admiration: who remain on duty so that others can enjoy the festival. This year, they will be joined by delivery boys and those numerous homemakers who will be cooking at a time when kitchens in Bengali homes are closed. Delivery of good food — not just food — is, after all, an essential service in Kolkata.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/poulit/article32845625.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/as-durga-puja-nears-kolkata-gears-up-to-eat-in/article32845626.ece
229,2020/10/14,Hathras gang rape case | Allahabad High Court pulls up Uttar Pradesh government,"Lucknow Bench unsatisfied with official response.

The Allahabad High Court has said it is not satisfied with the explanation of the Uttar Pradesh government on why it had taken action against the district police chief of Hathras but not the District Magistrate (DM) over the alleged rape of a Dalit woman and the hurried cremation of the victim, though it was admittedly a “collective decision”.

The action of the State authorities, though in the name of the law and order situation, was prima facie an infringement upon the human rights of the victim and her family, stated the court.

The Lucknow Bench also pulled up Additional Director General (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar and asked if it was proper for anyone not directly connected with the investigation to comment, even when the probe was pending. Mr. Kumar, who had controversially said that the FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory) report did not find semen in the victim’s body and hence ruled out rape, agreed that this should not happen.

Earlier, when the court asked Awanish Awasthi, Additional Chief Secretary-Home, why only the Superintendent of Police had been suspended but the DM was allowed to continue in his job, Mr. Awasthi said the first report of the SIT (Special Investigation Team) had indicted the Superintendent of Police. However, on being asked as whether the SIT had absolved the DM and if the role of the DM was the subject matter of the SIT probe, he stated it was not. “He could not give any satisfactory reply in this regard as to why the two officers had been treated differently,” said the court.

Mr. Awasthi then told court that the government would look into the question of allowing the present DM to continue in his post from the point of view of the investigation.

Family members of the victim and top State officials had on Monday appeared before the court and narrated their versions after the court had on October 1 taken up the matter of the alleged forced and hurried burial of the girl suo motu.

The High Court said that the investigation in the Hathras case — whether by the SIT or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) — should be kept in full confidentiality and no report or post of it should be leaked in public. The court also directed the State to ensure the safety and security of the family of the deceased victim.

The Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court, in an order dated October 12, also stated that no officer who was “not directly connected with the investigation should make any statement in public regarding commission of the offence alleged or otherwise based on evidence collected”.

This could lead to “unnecessary speculation and confusion amongst the masses, who may not be aware of niceties of law, thereby fuelling emotions on both sides,” observed Justices Pankaj Mithal and Rajan Roy.

The court on Monday also said that “without in any manner intending to interfere with the right of freedom of expression, we request the media as also the political parties to air their views in a manner which does not disturb social harmony and/or infringe upon rights of the victim’s family and that of the accused”.

No one should indulge in character assassination of the victim just as the accused should not be pronounced guilty before a fair trial, the judges noted.

The court noted that the facts and circumstances of the case ex facie reveal that the decision to cremate the victim in the night without handing over the body to the family members or seeking their consent was taken jointly by the administration at the local level and was implemented on the orders of the District Magistrate.

Editorial | Grapes of wrath: On Yogi Adityanath regime handling Hathras case

“The victim was at least entitled to decent cremation in accordance with her religious customs and rituals, which essentially are to be performed by her family,” said the court.

Sensitivities of the people which the Constitution recognises as fundamental rights, such as a right to decent burial or cremation as per traditions and customs followed by the family, have to be respected, the court noted.

If considerations of maintenance of law and order are pitted against such valuable rights, the situation needs to be handled deftly and responsibly with a proper appreciation of both the aspects as such valuable rights cannot be trampled or trifled casually or whimsically, especially when those likely to be deprived are of the downtrodden class, uneducated and poor, the court said.

The victim’s father, mother, elder brother, younger brother and elder brother’s wife narrated their versions on the matter to the Bench. The father of the deceased told court that neither he nor any member of the immediate family participated in the cremation on the intervening night of September 29 and 30, and that the administration cremated the body in the night itself despite their insistence to have the cremation in the morning.

The victim’s father pleaded that he wanted justice for his daughter but had no grudge against the officials, except that they refused to hand over the body of his daughter to the family and they were not allowed to cremate her in accordance with Hindu rituals.

Comment | Hathras, a new phase in the caste atrocity narrative

The mother of the deceased lamented that she had wanted to see her daughter’s face but she was not allowed, and against her wishes, the body was cremated in the night. She broke down while narrating the entire episode.

The brothers of the victim submitted that the authorities acted in an high-handed manner. The sister-in-law of the deceased was “very sour” and stated that the officers “be-fooled the family”, and some even misbehaved with the relatives who were present and tried to stop the ambulance from proceeding to the cremation ground.

District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar submitted before court that looking into the sensitivity of the Babri Masjid demolition verdict due on September 30 and the law and order situation, and “intervention of political parties” in the Hathras case, in consultation with Commissioner of Police-Aligarh; Additional Director General-Agra; Inspector General-Aligarh; Superintendent of Police-Aligarh, and himself, “a collective decision” was taken to cremate the body in the night itself.

If the cremation had been delayed and undertaken in the morning, a crowd of 10,000 people would have collected, and a caste and political issue made, the DM said.

“The entire decision was taken in a bona fide manner to maintain the law and order situation, and that the father of the deceased was convinced for cremation in the night. It was on his consent only that the body was cremated,” the DM said.

Hathras gang rape case | Police, media and the spectacle of grief in Boolgarhi

The DM further submitted that the cremation was done with full honour and it was incorrect to suggest that the body was burnt by sprinkling kerosene.

The court said, quoting the DM: “A proper pyre was laid. In the cremation, kerosene was not used and probably, the cans which may be appearing in some of the videos were those carrying Ganges water (Ganga jal).”

The DM categorically stated that “no one from above or Lucknow” had instructed him to take such a decision or had directed the carrying out of the cremation at night. But in the same vein, he had stated that he was not aware if some instructions had been given by the State in this regard to senior officers who were involved in the collective decision, said the court.

The District Magistrate, however, could not satisfy the court about the observance of last rites while cremating the victim’s body as per the traditions and customs of the family, the court said.

Mr. Kumar, ADG (Law and Order), Lucknow, endorsed the statement of the DM- Hathras and stated that, in view of the security inputs from all sources, a bona fide decision was taken at the local level by the administration to cremate the body in the night, and that there was no extraneous reason such as destroying evidence, etc., in carrying out the cremation at night.

The court also asked him if he was aware of the amendments in law relating to the definition of rape, and that the mere absence of semen during forensic examination, though a factor for consideration, would not by itself be conclusive as to whether rape had been committed or not, if there was other admissible evidence.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mbovd2/article32848379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hathras-policejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hathras-gang-rape-case-allahabad-high-court-pulls-up-uttar-pradesh-government/article32848297.ece

A Division Bench of Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya, while hearing a number of writ petitions filed by parents and guardians, said there will no increase in fees during financial year 2020-21 and non-essential charges for use of facilities not availed will not be permissible.

The court also observed that for the financial year 2020-21, a maximum of five per cent excess of revenue over expenditure will be permissible. While accepting the autonomy and freedom that private unaided schools generally enjoy, the Bench observed that “it is completely unacceptable that schools have not incurred less expenditure than usual since the lockdown came to be in force from or about the end of March this year”.

The court also added that every school will entertain applications from parents or guardians for further reduction or waiver or exemption or delayed or instalment payments, as the case may be. “Such applications have to be filed before the respective schools by November 15, 2020 and every application should be dealt with on an individual basis and a decision communicated to the applicant by December 31, 2020,” the order read.

If the parents or guardians are aggrieved by the decision of the school, an application may be filed, upon deposit of ₹1,000/ to a committee constituted by the court. Laying down procedures for the functioning of the committee the Court said that the “Committee must endeavour to dispose of every application within 45 days of the receipt thereof and the decision of the committee will be binding”.

A section of parents and guardians have been demanding reduction in school fees in the State. There have been protests outside several private schools. A group of parents approached the Calcutta High Court earlier this year and later parents or guardians of students of about 145 schools, mostly in and around the city, joined the petition demanding waiver or reduction of school fees as the schools were physically closed.

The Indian Institute of Cartoonists (IIC), Bengaluru, is celebrating Laxman by uploading a selection of his cartoons every day on its social media handles.

“As a student of Maharaja’s College in Mysuru, Laxman contributed to Koravanji, a Kannada monthly satirical magazine, brought out by writer and humorist Dr Ra Shivaram,” says VG Narendra, cartoonist and the brain behind IIC. “We are displaying these original cartoons.”

Apart from this, there will also be samples of Laxman’s work for RK Narayan’s novels —Malgudi Days, Swamy and Friends, Tenali Raman and The Man-Eater of Malgudi. “Laxman drew sketches for Wagle Ki Duniya, the show based on his Common Man, as well as for the book, Life in Kolkata, and one on Madhya Pradesh. He has also drawn for four books on management, and our online display will have some examples from all of these.”

Laxman’s unique take on political and social events was unmatched, says Narendra. “Ritu Gairola Khanduri, assistant professor of Cultural Anthropology at the University of Texas, who has studied Laxman, has rightly called him the cartoonist exemplary from India. GS Krishnan, who researched the cartoons, has called the period of Laxman, The Golden era of Indian cartooning.”

Narendra used to visit Laxman in Pune. “He appreciated my initiative of establishing the IIC. Laxman’s daughter-in-law, Usha, has been part of several of our exhibitions.”

Casual wandering thoughts

Five years ago when the IIC displayed 97 doodles from Laxman’s scrapbook, the response was unprecedented. The event was part of a tribute to Laxman’s 95th birth anniversary. Narendra had discovered the book of doodles when he had met Laxman’s nephew, RS Krishnaswamy. “Krishnaswamy casually mentioned Laxman’s doodles lying about at home. I snapped them up. The scrapbook had nearly a 100 doodles that we restored for posterity.”

Laxman was known to doodle on scraps of paper. “My father gave my uncle a scrapbook in 1975 thinking this would be the best way to gather all his drawings in a single book,” recalls Krishnaswamy. “My uncle was curious about how people discussed political and day-to-day matters. Doodu uncle’s doodles were the result of 20 years of casual, wandering thoughts from 1975 to 1995 in the by-lanes of Mysuru.”

“The doodle, The Odds Are Against Us, came about on a road trip,” Krishnaswamy recalls. “When I drove Doodu uncle from Mysore to Bengaluru, a herd of aadu (goats) on the road made me honk insistently. The result was the doodle.”

The selection of works can be viewed until October 24 at:

234,2020/10/14,Liquid oxygen tank installed at Tiruppur GH,"A liquid oxygen tank with a capacity of 3.5 kilolitres (kL) was recently installed at Tiruppur Government Medical College Hospital to ensure better oxygen supply for patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the hospital’s Dean Valli Sathyamoorthy, the tank supplied by the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) became functional from October 5.

“We initially asked for a 10 kL capacity tank, but the tank with 3.5 kL capacity was immediately available,” she said, noting the efforts of District Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan to ensure the early installation of the liquid medical oxygen tank at the hospital.

The liquid oxygen from the tank is converted into gaseous oxygen, which is then supplied to patients requiring oxygen support.

The requirement of oxygen supply for patients at Tiruppur Government Medical College Hospital had increased nearly 10 times between February and October due to the admission of COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) patients, Dr. Valli said. At the intensive care unit (ICU), 26 beds comprising 11 beds for COVID-19 patients and 15 beds for SARI patients are available and the new tank ensures better oxygen supply for the patients at the ICU, she noted.

235,2020/10/14,COVID-19: efforts on to control the spread,"Even as businesses in the district are gearing up for the festive season and workers are returning to factories, efforts are on to ensure that the spread of COVID-19 is contained.

“There are a lot of messages that are passed on through social media, resulting in lack of clarity among businesses and the public regarding testing, quarantine, etc. The Central Government issues broad guidelines whenever there are relaxation of lockdown restrictions and the State government modifies these according to the prevailing situation in the State. The local officials need to explain the procedures and systems so that there is no confusion among the public,” says a trader here.

District Collector K. Rajamani told The Hindu that the government and the district administration are working towards bringing the total number of positive cases a day in the district to less than 100, the testing-positive ratio to below5 % and the death rate to less than 1%. Currently, 5,500 to 6,000 samples are tested a day.

The district administration held talks with industry associations and has advised the trade and industry to quarantine workers returning from other States for 14 days before allowing them inside the factories. If any worker is showing symptoms, he or she should be tested.

Tests are done at private laboratories apart from government facilities. A few private hospitals also test patients who come to their campus. Those who have insurance can claim for the testing too. The officials have held talks with the testing laboratories to ensure there are no issues. The district administration has not asked any hospital or laboratory to stop testing, he said.

“We are repeatedly telling hospitals to admit COVID positive people so that the patients are not put to any difficulty,” he added. Regarding complaints about higher charges collected by some hospitals, he said that it is being monitored.

Three or four hotels have also opened their doors to hospitals to quarantine and test patients with moderate or mild symptoms. The family members of those who test positive can quarantine at home and observe if there are symptoms or can get tested.

The Collector pointed out the co-ordinated efforts are on to control the spread of the disease in the district. He urged the public not to believe false messages and interpretations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/covid-19-efforts-on-to-control-the-spread/article32857025.ece

A senior official from the district administration said that around 3,000 swab samples were being collected and tested every day in Tiruppur. The samples are collected at all government hospitals and primary health centres in the district. No private laboratories are conducting COVID-19 tests in Tiruppur district.

In a memorandum to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the association president A.C. Easwaran said the hosiery units started regular production recently after nearly six months disruption due to the spread of COVID-19. Though the government has extended supportive measures to help the industry revive, the Commercial Tax Department issued notices to several units recently regarding CST that was implemented nearly 15 years ago.

Mr. Easwaran explained that since 2004-2005, hosiery manufacturers who were into inter-State sales were paying 1% CST. Since 2007, after Value Added Tax (VAT) was introduced, when there were reports that C-form was not available, many units paid just the 1% tax. Though notices were not issued in the last 10 years, the Department has sent notices to the units now. Not all the units have the documents of 10 or 15 years to prove that they have paid the CST.

The association said the units should be permitted to pay just the 1 % tax for the period when C-form was required and the notices issued to those who had already paid the tax should be withdrawn.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/sihma-seeks-withdrawal-of-notices-issued-to-hosiery-manufacturers/article32854391.ece

252,2020/10/14,Indian Premier League 2020 | Kohli suggests DRS for wides and no-balls,"Virat Kohli would like the Decision Review System (DRS) to cover wides and waist-high no-balls.

In an Instalive session with K.L. Rahul on Wednesday, the India skipper said: “As a captain, I would like to have that. It can be big in a high-profile tournament like the IPL, and T20 in general, because it is so fast-paced and you can miss things. If you lose by a run and you cannot review that wide [or no-ball], it could make a massive difference.”

Cover everything

Rahul concurred, saying that the two reviews allowed should cover everything and not just dismissals.

He pointed to the erroneous short-run call in KXIP’s game against DC which the former lost in a Super Over.

255,2020/10/14,Tushar Deshpande — the new kid on the block,"Mumbai speedster debuts for Capitals against Royals

He has played a key role in Mumbai winning its first Vijay Hazare Trophy title in more than a decade. He has represented India-A as well. But it took his IPL debut for Tushar Deshpande to start trending on social media.

The Mumbai speedster who still lives in Kalyan, an eastern suburb more than 60 km far from his alma mater Shivaji Park Gymkhana in Dadar, was handed an IPL debut by Delhi Capitals versus Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday. It must have meant a hell a lot for the 25-year-old who earned an IPL contract for the first time in 2020.

Interestingly, Deshpande was a ball-boy at the Wankhede Stadium during the IPL’s maiden edition in 2008. “I remember our full under-13 team was at the IPL and I was overawed to see the likes of Dhawal Kulkarni, Abhishek Nayar, Pinal Shah, Dwayne Bravo, Shaun Pollock and, obviously, Sachin Tendulkar in action,” Deshpande had told Sportstar before leaving for the UAE.

“I remember there used to be a fridge full of Gatorade cans just outside the boundary rope. For a 13-year-old, more than watching and learning from the greats, the main aim used to be to open that fridge, get a can or bottle and sip it while enjoying the match. That’s the first IPL memory.”

Deshpande, who joined Mumbai’s T20 squad for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy three days after his mother’s demise last year, has been training with Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer since childhood at the Shivaji Park Gymkhana. In fact, the duo would often place an egg-sandwich bet in the nets.

Mutual respect

“I remember when we were together in the (Shivaji Park) academy, we didn’t really get along. Even now we are not the thickest of friends but we have immense mutual respect for each other. In the academy, we would have a mini-competition in the nets and the bet used to be whosoever loses will treat the other with egg sandwich and Bournvita in the gymkhana,” Deshpande said.

“Most of the times, I used to win because I knew how to bowl to him. When you are young, you don’t plan too much, all you think of is how I’ll dismiss a batsman off every ball. Sometimes he also used to win because he too is mentally very strong but majority I would win.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/oa19fh/article32856291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15TUSHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/deshpande-the-new-kid-on-the-block/article32856293.ece
256,2020/10/14,IPL 2020 | Spirited Delhi Capitals bowlers stifle Rajasthan Royals in the chase,"Defend target of 162 with skill and composure after 85-run stand between Dhawan and Shreyas keeps side in the game

On a night when some quality, express pace lit up the Dubai International Stadium, Delhi Capitals emerged victorious against Rajasthan Royals. That perhaps wasn’t surprising, as DC boasts the fastest, deadliest pair of pacers in the IPL.

The South Africans, Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje, received good support from debutant seamer Tushar Deshpande and spinners R. Ashwin and Axar Patel too, as DC won by 13 runs, defending an unimposing total of 161 for seven. The win also put Shreyas Iyer's men back on top of the table.

Shreyas (53, 43b, 3x4, 2x6), who had to leave the field after hurting his shoulder, had earlier put on 85 for the third wicket with Shikhar Dhawan (57, 33b, 6x4, 2x6).

They had to repair the DC innings, which had been reduced to 10 for two by Jofra Archer, who removed Prithvi Shaw with the first ball.

Later on, Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes gave a brisk start to RR's chase, both unleashing some spectacular shots. They added 37 inside the third over, which witnessed some great cricket.

Nortje was welcomed into the attack by Buttler with a glorious six over long-on. The batsman then ramped him to fine-leg twice for four. But the bowler had his revenge off the last ball, as Buttler was bowled through the gate by a delivery that clocked 155kmph.

A little later, Ashwin ensured Steve Smith would not get his form back in this match, inducing a leading edge from the Royals captain and completing the return catch. Then Deshpande had a dream start to his IPL career as he removed Stokes (41, 35b, 6x4) to end the threatening third-wicket partnership with Sanju Samson. The Kerala batsman would soon follow Stokes to the dugout, bowled by an arm ball from Axar, and when Riyan Parag was needlessly run out, Royals slumped to 110 for five. Robin Uthappa (32, 27b, 3x4, 1x6) had an excellent chance to become the hero by taking his side over the line, but a rapid Nortje yorker ended those hopes.

257,2020/10/14,South African cricket in danger of ban as government intervenes,"The statement from sports minister Nathi Mthethwa said he had informed the International Cricket Council of the intended action.

South Africa is in danger of being banned from international cricket after its government said on Wednesday that it intended to intervene in the affairs of the sport’s national body following revelations of serious misconduct by senior officials.

The statement from sports minister Nathi Mthethwa said he had informed the International Cricket Council of the intended action. The ICC’s constitution forbids government interference and the punishment is normally a ban from international games for the country’s teams until the national cricket body is operating independently again.

The tension between the South African government and Cricket South Africa (CSA) relates to a long-running investigation into the affairs of the cricket body, which resulted in the firing of CEO Thabang Moroe for serious misconduct in August.

But Cricket South Africa refused to make the report by independent investigators public and also resisted an attempt by the government-aligned South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee to conduct its own investigation into CSA.

CSA ultimately relented and publicly released a summary of the forensic investigation’s findings this month, more than two months after it received the report.

CSA was also forced to hand over the full report, nearly 500 pages long, to a committee of South African lawmakers last week after they demanded to see it. The parts of the report that have been publicly released revealed serious misconduct and possible acts of corruption and implicated Moroe and former chief operating officer Naasei Appiah in the wrongdoing.

But lawmakers who saw all the documents questioned on Tuesday why other executives and board members at the body were not investigated and if CSA was trying to hide wrongdoing by others.

They called it a one-sided report.” CSA is currently operating with an acting president and an acting CEO and the board has been severely criticised for failing to act to stop the misconduct during Moroe’s tenure.

On Wednesday, Mthethwa said a series of meetings with CSA to try and assist CSA to stabilise its governance matters had come to nothing and accused the Cricket body of being uncooperative.

“I have now reached a point where I see no value in any further engagement with CSA,” Mthethwa said. The sports minister gave cricket officials until October 27 to argue why he shouldn’t intervene.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/geofup/article32853971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Capture,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/south-african-cricket-in-danger-of-ban-as-government-intervenes/article32853972.ece
258,2020/10/14,"Misbah steps down as Pakistan chief selector, to remain head coach","Misbah insisted that he had not quit as chief selector because of pressure from the board

Former captain Misbah-ul-Haq on Wednesday said he will be stepping down as Pakistan’s chief selector next month to focus on his role as head coach of the national cricket team.

Misbah told a media briefing in Lahore that he has informed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that he would be stepping down as chief selector on November 30. He took up the dual role of chief selector and head coach in September last year.

“I will select the squad for the coming series against Zimbabwe but after that I just want to focus on my work as head coach,” he said.

Misbah insisted that he had not quit as chief selector because of pressure from the board.

“No, it is purely my own personal decision and I took it because I think it is not easy doing two high profile jobs at one time. I want to give my best as head coach of the national team.

“Whoever is appointed as chief selector, I will fully cooperate with him and work to take the Pakistan team into the top three of every format,” Misbah said.

The former captain also made it clear that his decision had nothing to do with his meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan last month when he and senior players, Azhar Ali and Muhammad Hafeez, raised the issue of departmental teams being closed down in domestic cricket.

The PCB made it clear it was not happy with Misbah and the two other players going directly to meet the PM to discuss what was a policy decision of the board.

“If that meeting was the reason for my stepping down as chief selector then I think I would have also lost my head coach position,” Misbah said.

PCB Chairman Ehsan Mani and CEO Wasim Khan recently met with Misbah and Azhar and gave them a dressing down and cautioned them not to make the mistake of directly seeking meetings with the PM who is also the patron in chief of the board.

Misbah said with time he understood that it would be possible to give his best only to one role.

“When I accepted both positions I thought I could manage it but with time I think it is better for me to focus on one job.”

Misbah was appointed head coach and chief selector after the PCB released Mickey Arthur and his support staff following Pakistan’s failure to make the World Cup semi-finals.

PCB chief executive Wasim Khan said the Board respects Misbah’s decision.

“When he took on the national head coach role, we also required him to take on the chief selector’s role due to circumstances at that point in time,” he said.

“Pakistan has three global events, including two Asia Cups and the ICC T20 World Cup 2021, as well as 10 Future Tour Programme commitments over the next 24 years.

“As head coach of the national side, he has reassessed his priorities and believes he has a better chance of producing the desired results by focusing solely on the coaching side. We are very happy to support his thinking on this,” he added.

Khan said a new chief selector would be appointed soon and would be “in post to begin work from December 1“.

“With a new chief selector, we will revisit the selection criteria to ensure that there is complete alignment between the Selection Committee, the High Performance Centre and the national men’s cricket team.

“With so much red and white-ball cricket ahead, we will need to select squads that have a strong balance between youth and experience,” he said.

Pakistan’s tentative FTP commitments till September 2022:

Oct/Nov 2020 — Home series against Zimbabwe (three ODIs and three T20Is)

Nov/Dec 2020 — Away series against New Zealand (two Tests and three T20Is)

259,2020/10/14,NZ’s oldest surviving Test cricketer John Reid dies at 92,"“He was, and will remain, a household name in this country.”

New Zealand’s oldest surviving Test cricketer and former captain John Reid has died here at the age of 92, the country’s cricket board said on Wednesday.

Reid, regarded as one of the world’s best all-rounders during his heyday in the fifties and early sixties, captained New Zealand in 34 Tests including, most notably, the country’s first three victories.

“He was, and will remain, a household name in this country, having helped pave the way for everything that has come in his wake,” New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White said in a statement offering his tributes.

The NZC release, however, did not specify the cause of Reid’s death.

“Our thoughts and respect are with his family at this time: wife Norli; children Alison, Richard and Ann, and all his grand-children,” White said.

Born in Auckland, and educated in Wellington, Reid played 246 first-class games and scored 16128 runs at 41.35, including 39 centuries, while taking 466 wickets at 22.60.

A hard-hitting right batsman and a seam bowler, he played 58 Tests after making his debut as a 19-year-old in 1949, scoring 3428 runs at 33.28, while taking 85 wickets at 33.35.

Of his six Test centuries, the highest was 142 against South Africa in Johannesburg, in the Boxing Day Test of 1961.

He retired in 1965 and later became a New Zealand selector, manager, and an ICC match referee.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/naq5j2/article32852432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JOHNREID1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nzs-oldest-surviving-test-cricketer-john-reid-dies-at-92/article32852433.ece
260,2020/10/14,Gayle set for IPL 2020 debut as KXIP face RCB in must-win game,"KXIP can take confidence from the fact their only win in the tournament has come against RCB.

Kings XI Punjab will be hoping that Chris Gayle fires on his much-awaited return and they, for once, put up a complete performance in their must-win game against a high-flying Royal Challengers Bangalore here on Thursday.

The inability to produce an all-round show and close out games they should have won has led to KXIP losing six out of their seven matches.

But KXIP can take confidence from the fact their only win in the tournament has come against RCB, who look a much more potent squad since their last meeting on September 24.

Though the Sharjah wicket has been slowing gradually, the smaller ground dimensions are ideal for someone like Gayle to go on a six-hitting spree.

However, it certainly won’t be easy for the 41-year-old to get going from ball one, having not played earlier in the competition.

He would have played the last two games but could not due to food poisoning. Having recovered fully, it will be interesting to see who he replaces in the side.

Benching a yet to fire Glenn Maxwell is one option or the team can bring Gayle at the expense of an overseas bowler and replace him with the available Indian talent.

KXIP are languishing at the bottom of the table despite having the top-two leading run-getters of the tournament in skipper K.L. Rahul (387 at strike rate of 134.84) and his opening partner Mayank Agarwal (337 at 48.14).

Barring Mohammad Shami and Ravi Bishnoi, none of the bowlers have inspired confidence, especially in the death overs.

Not being able to find the right balance despite trying out many options has also contributed to KXIP’s rapid slide.

They run into a RCB squad which has grown in confidence by leaps and bounds since their last meeting.

For the first time in many years, they seem to have fixed their bowling woes.

Their spin pairing of Washington Sundar and Yuzvendra Chahal has proved very effective and the pace department has strengthened with the return of Chris Morris from injury.

RCB’s last game against KKR was also on this ground, so they come into the game more aware of the gradually changing conditions than KXIP, who played here last on September 27 when the surface was much better to bat on.

With Aaron Finch back among the runs against KKR, RCB’s top-four (including Devdutt Padikkal, Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers) can be a nightmare for any team.

Squads:

RCB: Virat Kohli (c), AB de Villiers, Parthiv Patel (wk), Aaron Finch, Josh Philippe, Chris Morris, Moeen Ali, Mohammed Siraj, Shahbaz Ahmed, Devdutt Padikkal, Yuzvendra Chahal, Navdeep Saini, Dale Steyn, Pawan Negi, Isuru Udana, Shivam Dube, Umesh Yadav, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Washington Sundar, Pavan Deshpande, Adam Zampa.

261,2020/10/14,Made changes as trend of our losses was becoming too familiar: CSK coach Fleming,"“We have put the onus on the batting group rather than hiding and shuffling it.”

Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming is glad that changes made to the team broke an increasingly familiar “trend of losses” in the IPL and said the side will look to find new ways to achieve match-day perfection in the upcoming games.

The most prominent change in Tuesday’s 20-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad was Sam Curran’s elevation to the opener’s slot and Fleming said the move provided momentum to the CSK innings. Curran scored 31 off 21 balls in the 20-run triumph, only their third in eight matches this season.

“We had Sam padded up for every innings. We thought rather than getting clogged up and probably too much batting resources, we would take one out and be certain about Sam and put him on the front,” Fleming said at the post-match press conference.

“We have put the onus on the batting group rather than hiding and shuffling it. It was great and Sam provided a little bit of momentum in the front. We wanted to do something different because the trend of our losses was becoming too familiar,” Fleming said after CSK’s 20-run win.

Asked about their next match against Delhi Capitals in Sharjah on Saturday, he said, “We cannot be a perfect side. We have to find ways to introduce new players who can make a difference on the day.”

The CSK coach said there were “some apprehension” about batting first and putting up 167 for 6 on the board against SRH.

“It was nice to bat first. It was the first time we batted first and won. We were used to chasing. We were also a little bit apprehensive but it was in line with most scores, currently the tracks are getting slower and turning,” said Fleming.

He admitted that CSK were facing some challenges around the balance of the squad but said they were trying to work through.

“We have got the luxury of too many batsmen and too many bowlers. The plan was to have an extra spinner as the pitches were getting slower and it was quite positive to have a leg-spinner (Piyush Chawla).”

On CSK using seven bowlers in the match, he said, “Our bowling attack is fluid. MS (Dhoni) was comfortable with an extra bowler — an extra leg spinner — which was a positive option as we felt the pitch might slow down.

“As it turned out, he (Chawla) only bowled one over but it was a good over. It was positive rather than carrying an extra batter,” said the former New Zealand captain.

Talking about the reasons behind sending Watson at number three, Fleming said, “Shane has got a lot of experience. Against swing bowlers, he is very well-equipped to take on the attack in the second half of power-play or later.

“(Opener) Faf (du Plessis) is very good at going over the top early, while Shane has more of a power game, suited to the next phase of the innings.”

For Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kane Williamson top-scored with 57 runs but they fell short. Head coach Trevor Bayliss insisted that Williamson was doing a good job at number four and he was being slotted there to guide the young Indian players in the middle order.

“Look, there is an argument for playing Williamson higher up the order, obviously he is a high-quality player, currently he is doing the job for us at number four and hopefully bat with some of the young guys in the lower middle-order.

“His experience can help out the younger players. He is a very good player, if he bats at number three, he can play bigger knocks but playing at number four is his role right now,” Bayliss said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jeaw6/article32851003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FLEMING,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/made-changes-as-trend-of-our-losses-was-becoming-too-familiar-csk-coach-fleming/article32851004.ece

Relieved and ecstatic in equal measure, Chennai Super Kings skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni lauded his team’s “close to perfect” show in the triumph over Sunrisers Hyderabad that infused fresh life into its faltering IPL campaign.

CSK pulled off a 20-run victory on Tuesday while defending 167 against Sunrisers with almost every player making a contribution. It was only their third win in eight games.

“Ultimately what really matters is you getting two points. What T20s have shown is that there are a few games that don’t go your way and then there are some that go your way even when you haven’t earned it. Today I felt we did a very good job even in batting,” said Dhoni after the match.

Before Tuesday’s game, Dhoni had likened his side to a sinking ship with too many holes to plug, listing batting as the main worry.

“There was some purpose with the bat and the batsmen assessed the situation very well. With a total like 160, it all depends on the start you get in the first six overs,” Dhoni said.

“The fast bowlers did the job, the spinners came into play and it was one game that was as close to being perfect,” he added.

One of the tactical changes was sending big-hitting all-rounder Sam Curran to open the innings and Dhoni said it made sense.

“Sam Curran is a complete cricketer for us. You need a seaming all-rounder, he plays the spinners well and he can give us those 15-45 runs...We used an extra spinner because an Indian batter hasn’t done well for us.

“That’s why Curran went up and it wasn’t fair on (Narayan) Jagadeesan as well to bat at seven or eight.”

Dhoni quickly finished the quota of pacer Deepak Chahar, who bowled in tandem with Curran.

“There are some two paced balls, some swing and some don’t swing, some get extra bounce. What was needed was good execution of the plans and that was done by the fast bowlers.

“A good left-armer is always good to have in the side. You keep wondering whether the ball would come in or leave the batsman.

“As the tournament progresses we’ll get more comfortable with the death bowling, which is why we kept Sam away from the death and (Shardul) Thakur and Bravo took over. We’ll get better.”

Losing skipper David Warner said the wicket was on the slower side and they needed an extra batter.

“We tried to take it deep. You got one big boundary, so it’s not easy. We have to go back to the drawing board and work on few areas. I thought 160 was the right total to go after, but anything above that was always going to be difficult,” said the Australian.

“We need to monitor the wickets in the upcoming games and select the team accordingly. I think with our team and the depth that we have, we’re always going to be one short either way,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/k2ummd/article32850519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDCSK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-it-was-a-close-to-perfect-game-for-us-says-dhoni-after-win-over-srh/article32850520.ece
263,2020/10/14,50 teams of CPCB to keep a check on polluting activities in Delhi-NCR: Government,"The Ministry of Environment said the teams will visit Delhi and NCR towns - Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut in Uttar Pradesh; Gurugram, Faridabad, Ballabgarh, Jhajjar, Panipat, Sonepat in Haryana; and Bhiwadi, Alwar, Bharatpur in Rajasthan

In order to step up efforts for ensuring better air quality in the upcoming winter season, strict vigil will be maintained against polluting activities in Delhi and neighbouring towns, the Ministry of Environment said on Wednesday.

Fifty teams of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) will be deployed to make extensive field visits from October 15 this year till February 28 next year, it said.

In a statement, the Ministry of Environment said the teams will visit Delhi and NCR towns - Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut in Uttar Pradesh; Gurugram, Faridabad, Ballabgarh, Jhajjar, Panipat, Sonepat in Haryana; and Bhiwadi, Alwar, Bharatpur in Rajasthan.

These teams will specifically focus on hotspot areas where the problem is aggravated, it said.

“Strict vigil will be maintained against polluting activities in the upcoming winter season. On-spot reporting of major air polluting sources such as major construction activities without proper control measures, dumping of garbage and construction waste alongside the roads and on open plots, unpaved roads, open burning of garbage/industrial waste, etc. will be done using SAMEER App.

“Feedback on polluting activities will be shared with concerned agencies through an automated system, for quick action. Details will also be shared with State Governments. This will help in taking timely actions and monitoring at appropriate levels by the concerned agencies,” it said.

The ministry said that a central control room at the CPCB headquarters has been made functional for keeping track of pollution levels on hour-to-hour basis and overall coordination with State agencies.

In addition, district-wise nodal officers have been appointed for better management and coordination with teams, the ministry said.

“Air quality in winter season is a major environmental concern in Delhi and NCR region. Various efforts are being taken since past five years for air quality management in the region. Although gradual year-on-year improvement in air quality has been observed, a lot needs to be done,” it said.

The national capital’s air quality hit an eight-month low and was recorded just a notch above the very poor category on Tuesday.

The city’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 306 on Tuesday morning. The pollution levels dipped slightly due to an improvement in the ventilation index.

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.

The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, SAFAR, said, The development of strong surface-level inversion and sudden local, calm surface wind conditions led to a low ventilation coefficient and accumulation of pollutants near the surface.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4lav12/article32210345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THDELHIANDPOLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/50-teams-of-cpcb-to-keep-a-check-on-polluting-activities-in-delhi-ncr-government/article32853932.ece
264,2020/10/14,"Akbar’s defamation case against Ramani: Trial vitiated if found that ACMM has no jurisdiction, says Delhi Court","A Delhi court Wednesday said if it is found that the magisterial court trying the criminal defamation case filed by former union minister M.J. Akbar against journalist Priya Ramani for two years did not have the jurisdiction, the entire trial, and not just the final argument, gets vitiated .

The observation came from the court which will pass an order on October 22 on whether to transfer a criminal defamation complaint from the court of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) to another judge.

An ACMM trying the case had on Tuesday sent the matter to Principal District and Sessions Judge seeking transfer of the matter to another court on the ground that his court was designated to hear cases filed against lawmakers.

Principal District and Sessions Judge Sujata Kohli, who reserved the order, noted that the notification does not bar the Magistrate concerned from hearing matters other than those against MPs and MLAs.

However, the object behind the notification is that the cases against the lawmakers be decided expeditiously, the judge said.

She, however, pointed out that in case it is found that the magisterial court trying the matter did not have the jurisdiction, the entire trial, and not just the final argument, gets vitiated .

None of the counsel raised this point earlier. If we go behind the issue that the court has no jurisdiction, not just the final argument but the entire proceeding gets vitiated, the judge said.

During the arguments, senior advocate Geeta Luthra, appearing for Mr. Akbar, said that almost entire trial was over and only a few dates were remaining.

Great prejudiced would be caused if the matter the further delayed, the counsel said.

The counsel appearing for Ms. Ramani, however, said that the accused had no objection to any order passed by the court.

While starting the argument Luthra told the court that a “joint request” was being made that the matter be sent back to the same trial court that has been hearing the case for over two years now.

We are making a joint request that the matter be sent back to Judge Pahuja... Two years back, the case was marked to his court. Both of us argued in detail. There is no point in re-arguing the final argument, Luthra said.

Ms. Ramani’s counsel, Bhavook Chauhan, however, said that though it was supposed to be a joint statement, he had gone through the notification regarding the trial court’s jurisdiction and would leave it to the wisdom of the District Judge to decide.

ACMM Vishal Pahuja, who had started the final arguments in the case on February 7 this year, sent the matter to district and sessions judge, saying the case in hand was not filed against MP or MLA and needs to be transferred to the “Competent Court of Jurisdiction“.

Pahuja said his court (court of ACMM) was designated to try the cases filed against the lawmakers by a circular passed on February 23, 2018 and since this case was not filed against MP/MLA , he was marking the matter to Principal District and Sessions Judge to consider re-assigning the case to another Metropolitan Magistrate.

Mr. Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ms. Ramani in March 2018.

In the wake of #MeToo movement, Ms. Ramani in 2018 accused Mr. Akbar of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago when he was a journalist.

Mr. Akbar resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.

Ms. Ramani had earlier told the court that she was targeted selectively through a criminal defamation complaint by Mr. Akbar, to halt the avalanche of allegations of sexual misconduct that came out against him in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2008.

Mr. Akbar had said that Ms. Ramani defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation.

He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.

Mr. Akbar had earlier told the court that the allegations made in an article in the ‘Vogue’ and the subsequent tweets were defamatory on the face of it as the complainant had deposed them to be false and imaginary and that an immediate damage was caused to him due to the false allegations by Ms. Ramani.

Ms. Ramani had earlier told the court that her disclosure of alleged sexual harassment by Mr. Akbar has come at a great personal cost and she had nothing to gain from it.

She had said her move would empower women to speak up and make them understand their rights at workplace.

Several women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by M.J. Akbar him while they were working as journalists under him.

He has termed the allegations false, fabricated and deeply distressing and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/80zogz/article32605753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DL-COURT-LD-AKBGG77OTVDF3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/akbars-defamation-case-against-ramanitrial-vitiated-if-found-that-acmm-has-no-jurisdictioncourt/article32853761.ece
265,2020/10/14,"Delhi govt to frame policy for regulating coaching institutes; lay down norms for fee, facilities","“Private coaching centres are running a parallel education system.”

The Delhi government is in the process of formulating a policy for regulation of private coaching centres functioning in the capital and frame guidelines with respect to basic facilities, fee and safety measures, according to officials.

Noting that private coaching centres are running a parallel education system and are still out of the ambit of any regulation and running without any statutory compliances leading to serious hazards to students, the government has asked institutes with enrolment of more than 20 students to register themselves with the Directorate of Education (DoE).

The government also proposes to collect the data of such institutes and details of their infrastructure, land area, basic facilities, fee structure, safety standards etc.

“Private coaching institutes and centres, imparting pre-admission coaching to students for admission into medical and engineering or any other professional courses or pre-examination coaching for securing government or private job through written or oral examination conducted by any agency of the government or a private establishment, or coaching and tuition of any subject taught at secondary or senior secondary school examination level, are growing rapidly in Delhi,” said Yogesh Pal Singh, Delhi’s Assistant Director of Education.

“The students from all over India come in the city for preparation of such examination and seek admission in private coaching centres. These institutions are running a parallel education system and are still out of the ambit of any regulation and running without any statutory compliances leading to serious hazards to students,” he added.

Mr. Singh pointed out that a tragic fire incident at a coaching centre in Gujarat’s Surat, which claimed lives of 22 students, has drawn the attention of the government to formulate guidelines for such private coaching institutions and centres with respect to basic facilities, fee and safety measures etc.

“It has also come to the notice of the government about some events of cheating and fraud on the part of some private coaching centres which remain unattended due to lack of regulation in this field. The government is very much concerned to safeguard the interest of such students already enrolled or desirous to enroll into such coaching institutes in Delhi.”

“Therefore, it is felt that there is an urgent need to regulate the functioning of education provided by such coaching institute and centres within jurisdiction of Delhi,” Mr. Singh said.

The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had in February this year categorised the coaching centres (for more than 20 students) as educational building in building bye-laws.

“For the purpose of framing policy for regulation of such private coaching centres, the Directorate of Education, proposes to collect the data of these and details of their infrastructure, land area, basic facilities, fee structure, safety standards etc. available with them.”

“Therefore, general public, societies, trusts, agencies, organisations, individuals running private coaching institutes or centres in Delhi having the enrolment of more than 20 students are hereby directed to register themselves with the Directorate of Education and furnish the requisite information in prescribed proforma till October 15,” Mr. Singh added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-govt-to-frame-policy-for-regulating-coaching-institutes-lay-down-norms-for-fee-facilities/article32852806.ece

The hospital had been a COVID-19 treatment facility and was converted into a non-COVID-19 facility on Tuesday.

“We have not been paid for the last four months and we have been protesting against it from October 5. Today, healthcare workers from other NDMC hospitals also joined the protest at the Hindu Rao Hospital's gate,” said Dr. Sagardeep Bawa, vice president of the Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of the Hindu Rao Hospital.

267,2020/10/14,"Pleas by two same sex couples for getting married, recognition of marriage: HC seeks Centre’s stand","Two separate pleas sought the declaration that the Special Marriage Act and Foreign Marriage Act ought to apply to all couples regardless of their gender identity and sexual orientation.

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to respond to two separate petitions by same-sex couples seeking to declare that the Special Marriage Act (SMA) and Foreign Marriage Act (FMA) ought to apply to all couples regardless of their gender identity and sexual orientation.

A Bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Asha Menon remarked that they had no doubts as to the maintainability of the petitions but wanted answers as to whether the definition of marriage under the customary law also needed to be challenged going forward. The Bench said both the statutes — SMA and FMA — did not provide for what was marriage.

“Marriage is not defined...When something goes against what an authority in India has been seeing for his/her entire life, they won’t accept it...Our doubt is that you (petitioners) would encounter this difficulty later during the proceeding,” the Bench remarked.

It additionally said that marriage till now had not been statutory. “Marriage under Indian law is customary. Because there was no inter-faith, we came up with a special statute,” the Bench said adding that once the concept of marriage was understood as including ‘same-sex’ it would be followed in other statutes as well.

Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for the petitioners, argued that multiple judgments of the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court had said that sexual orientation could not be grounds for discrimination.

She stated that the petitioners were challenging the constitutionality of the reading of the statutes. Ms. Guruswamy argued that SMA prohibited “who cannot enter into a marriage”, including age restrictions.

The High Court had posted the case for further hearing on January 8 next year.

One of the petitions filed by two women said they had been a couple for eight years, lived together and shared the highs, the lows and the joys and sorrows of life. They sought a direction to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate Kalkaji here to register their marriage under the SMA.

The other plea has been moved by two men, who got married in the United States, but their marriage registration was denied under the FMA as it excluded same-sex marriages.

Nomination problems

The two women in their petition stated that the lack of a legal structure around their relationship became increasingly stark when they tried to bring each other on as nominees in insurance and financial plans, just as a married couples did.

“The petitioners’ relationship is not recognised when they need to apply for address verification of their passport, or apply for a joint bank account, or co-own assets,” their plea stated.

They were unable to do simple things that a married couple took for granted. They said that for the longest time, one of them did not have any proof of residence, even though the other owned the flat they lived in. This became particularly difficult when they had to apply for a passport to travel abroad.

Additionally, the couple could not take medical decisions for each other if the other partner was unable to consent to a medical procedure or take end-of-life decisions, their plea contended.

“The petitioners wish to have the protection of the bundle of rights that a marriage provides, so that they are not trying to get authorities to acknowledge their relationship for every entitlement or right that married couples would get automatically,” their plea said.

Legal recognition

The two men in their petition sought for the legal recognition of their status as a married couple, and to be able to secure the rights, privileges, and benefits for each other appurtenant to the legal recognition of marriage in India.

They claimed that their plea for registration of marriage was rejected by the Indian consulate at New York on the ground that they were of the same sex.

They argued that the right to marry a person of one’s choice had been expressly recognised as being a facet of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

The FMA failed to recognise same-sex marriages, and hence it violated multiple facets of Article 21 of the Constitution.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sk3w1a/article32851052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRIDEMARCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pleas-by-two-same-sex-couples-for-getting-married-recognition-of-marriage-hc-seeks-centres-stand/article32851053.ece
268,2020/10/14,High Court grants bail to man in Delhi riots case,"‘No video to back prosecution’s claims’

The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a man who was arrested for allegedly rioting during the north-east Delhi communal violence in February this year, after noting there is no CCTV footage, video clip or photo to corroborate the prosecution’s claim.

Justice Suresh Kumar Kait ordered that Mohd. Rehman be released on bail, if not required in any other case, on his furnishing a personal bond of ₹25,000 with one surety of like amount.

Mr. Rehman was arrested in connection with an FIR lodged at Dayalpur police station on March 4 under charges of rioting.

The special public prosecutor opposed the bail plea on the grounds that during investigation, primary witness had identified Mr. Rehman along with other co-accused. The prosecutor stated that Mr. Rehman is involved in four other riot cases.

The HC, however, remarked: “It is not in dispute that in the present case there is no CCTV footage, video clip or photo to corroborate the prosecution’s claim.”

Justice Kait also questioned why two Delhi police constables, who recorded statements as eyewitnesses in the case and identified Mr. Rehman, “did not make any daily diary entry as the alleged incident occurred on February 25, whereas the present FIR was registered on March 4.” The court further noted that the constables did not make a PCR call on the day of the incident.

It additionally observed that the other witnesses who claimed to know Mr. Rehman also did not make any complaint to the police on the day of the alleged incident. “In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the petitioner deserves bail as he is in judicial custody since April 20. Charge sheet has already been filed. Charges are yet to be framed.

269,2020/10/14,Delhi court seeks transfer of case against Priya Ramani,"Matter not filed against MP/MLA, hence cannot be tried by this court: Judge Vishal Pahuja

A Delhi court, which was hearing former Union Minister M.J. Akbar’s defamation case against journalist Priya Ramani for her tweets accusing him of sexual harassment for about two years, on Tuesday said it cannot hear the case any more because of a recent verdict of the Supreme Court.

“As the present matter is not filed against Member of Parliament (MP)/Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA), hence cannot be tried by this court and needs to be transferred to the competent court of jurisdiction,” Judge Vishal Pahuja said.

On September 16, the apex court had asked the Chief Justices of all High Courts to list before an appropriate Bench all pending criminal cases involving sitting and former lawmakers where stay was granted.

Case record

In terms of this order, certain cases that did not pertain to sitting and former lawmakers but were already being heard by Judge Pahuja were transferred to other courts. On Tuesday, when Mr. Akbar’s case came up for hearing, Judge Pahuja said, “Let this matter be put up before the court of Principal District and Sessions Judge (Rouse Avenue District Courts) for October 14... for further appropriate orders.”

Speaking to The Hindu, senior advocate Rebecca John said since this case was instituted by Mr. Akbar, the court has referred it to the Principal District and Sessions Judge. If the case is transferred to another court, it will commence at the stage of final argument where it left off. “The record of the case goes with the case,” said Ms. John.

At the height of the ‘MeToo movement’ in 2018, Ms. Ramani had accused Mr. Akbar of sexual harassment during his previous role as newspaper editor. Following Ms. Ramani’s accusation, about a dozen former colleagues of Mr. Akbar also came out with different allegations against him.

The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Tuesday informed the Delhi High Court that its method of allocation of seats for disabled did not achieve the mandate of 5% reservation provided under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act.

Reacting to the submission, a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said: “You cannot juggle your allocation of seats in such a way that you achieve only 4 or 4.5% reservation for PWD instead of 5% or more. Can you have an administrative allocation which results in not achieving the 5% reservation in admission? If you are not realising the purpose behind the statute, then we have a problem.”

The HC said if JNU allocates seats for disabled persons in courses or centres, where such students do not apply or there are few applications, then the varsity will not realise the 5% reservation provided under the Act.

JNU’s counsel Monika Arora said the issue will be placed before its executive council, which will consider coming up with a better method of allocating seats to ensure 5% quota is met.

The court has posted the case for hearing on November 6, when JNU will indicate how it will ensure that the reservation criteria are met.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/seat-allocation-method-didnt-achieve-5-quota/article32848403.ece

Last week, 20 COVID-19 patients were shifted from the civic hospital to two Delhi government hospitals after healthcare workers of Hindu Rao called for a strike over non-payment of salaries. The order said the hospital was converted into a non-COVID 19 hospital due to “low average bed occupancy” and a request by the civic body commissioner.

An 18-year-old youth has been arrested in connection with the killing of a Delhi University student in north-west Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar, the police said on Tuesday.

The accused, Shubham Bhardwaj from Jahangirpuri, was involved with his friends in the killing, said the police, who have already arrested two people and apprehended three others in connection with the case.

Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday alleged that the Delhi Police, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Centre, is harassing an eyewitness in the murder of Rahul Rajput.

“In The Hindu’s article, a reporter had said that in a video call, the eyewitness said at 8 p.m., three police officers came to meet her in plain clothes and a woman officer took her SIM card and damaged it,” said AAP chief Spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj at a press meet. The AAP leader added that the police is harassing the eyewitness because she has claimed that despite repeated requests, the officers remained silent at the time of the incident.

“On one hand, the BJP says that Hindus are in danger and on the other hand, in front of the Delhi Police, a Hindu boy was beaten to death. Why didn’t the police stop them?” he asked.

“The most shameful thing here is that an official eyewitness, who is giving a statement against her own brothers, and who is under police protection in Nari Niketan, had her SIM card changed by a woman officer and the police say they know nothing about it,” the AAP leader said.

According to the FIR, Haileymandi municipal committee chairman Suresh Kumar, secretary Sushil Kumar and engineer Hemanth Kumar allegedly colluded with a construction firm and others to withdraw government money against the payment for the construction of a 500-metre road from Mata Mandir to the house of one Laxmi Narain in ward no.2.

Fraud entries

The road was not constructed and the accused persons prepared fraud entries in the measurement book, causing loss to the government.

The FIR said that Gurugram Additional Deputy Commissioner, in his letter to the Deputy Commissioner, on December 27 last year confirmed the crime.

Ramesh said he gave a complaint to Haileymandi Police post in-charge seeking registration of FIR on March 9 with reference to the probe by the ADC, but the police officer concerned did not register the case.

“It is mandatory for the police to register an FIR for a cognisable offence or inform the complainant in case the complaint is rejected. But the police officer concerned neither registered the case nor informed me,” said Ramesh",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/municipal-panel-members-booked-for-embezzling-9-lakh-from-govt/article32848380.ece
276,2020/10/14,Woman held for duping businessmen of over ₹2 crore,"Accused induced them to deliver goods against post-dated cheques

A 25-year-old woman was arrested for allegedly duping various businessmen of over ₹2 crore in the Capital, police said on Tuesday.

Police said one Ashok Kumar, along with 10 other victims, alleged that directors of VPG Stores Pvt Ltd, Abhishek Tyagi and the woman, induced them to deliver goods against post-dated cheques.

After receiving the goods, the company stopped the payments. The amount involved in the case is around ₹2.60 crore, police said.

During investigation, it was found that the directors of the company actively induced the victims to supply goods such as rice, dry fruits, edible oils etc. to the company after issuing post-dated cheques, a senior police officer said.

“They initially cleared some cheques to win the confidence of the victims, but after getting goods worth crores, they issued instructions to the bank to stop the payment and sold the products at lesser price to various other businessmen,” Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW) O.P. Mishra said.

Thereafter, the accused intentionally removed themselves from the directorship of the company and appointed the peon and office boy of the company as directors, he said. It was also found that the main accused Abhishek Tyagi was involved in more than a dozen cases.

Police were trailing the woman from her hometown in Uttarakhand to Delhi.

277,2020/10/14,Kejriwal kick-starts use of bio-decomposer solution,"CM asks govts. to work together to tackle stubble burning issue

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday visited Hiranki village in Narela to kick-start the process of spraying a newly developed bio-decomposer solution on 700-800 hectares of paddy fields in Delhi to curb the practise of stubble burning.

Mr. Kejriwal said that the solution has been developed under the guidance of the Pusa Institute and arrangement for spraying is being done free of cost. He added that all governments have to work in tandem to address the issue of stubble burning in northern India.

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai was also present at the launch of the process. “To end issue of stubble burning, the process of production of this liquid solution was started in Delhi around 10 days ago. The Delhi government has created the solution, which will be sprayed on the fields and convert stubble into manure,” Mr. Rai said.

“The solution will be sprayed on 700-800 hectares of land in Delhi in the next few days. The stubble will convert into manure and the land will be ready for sowing in the next 20-25 days,” he added.

Land productivity

Mr. Kejriwal said said that stubble burning destroys useful bacteria in farms and that the spray solution would increase the productivity of the land and decrease use of fertilisers.

He added that pollution was under control in Delhi for the past 10 months but now he was concerned for residents of the city, Punjab and Haryana due to smoke from stubble burning.

“In a village where the farmers are forced to burn their stubble, we cannot imagine the pollution that it can cause. The farmers of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and the residents of Delhi are in trouble and no government is taking concrete steps to address the issue. I hope that the government will take measures to address stubble burning so that the country can be pollution-free,” he said.

“We do not have to blame each other, Every government has to work with one another to resolve the issue. If the Delhi government can do it, so can other State governments. We have to work together with sincerity to address the issue,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-kick-starts-use-of-bio-decomposer-solution/article32848368.ece
278,2020/10/14,DMRC to conduct survey to find solution to overcrowding,"Study to assess whether commuters can reschedule travel

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Tuesday said that an online survey will be conducted to study the possibility of commuters planning their travel in flexible timings to avoid overcrowding.

DMRC officials said that the aim behind the survey was to assess whether commuters can schedule their travel in off peak hours to avoid the rush.

Cover basic aspects

“The questions of the survey are designed to cover basic aspects of metro travel such as the timings of travel, line utilisation, flexibility of planning the travel in non-peak hours and whether the commuters have an option of working from home. The inputs provided by commuters will help Delhi Metro to understand the commuters’ requirements better and to improve the services,” the DMRC said.

The link to the online survey will be available on the Delhi Metro’s social media platforms till October 27, it added.

“With new guidelines and social distancing in place, the occupancy on the metro has been limited. However, it has been observed that certain sections of the network have witnessed 100% occupancy during the peak hours. In view of this, the commuters are requested to break the peak by staggering the travel timings,” the public transporter said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dpnpsh/article32848351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL13-METRO2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dmrc-to-conduct-survey-to-find-solution-to-overcrowding/article32848352.ece
279,2020/10/14,"NGT issues notice to Centre, pollution body on groundwater extraction plea","Panel also raps CGWA for repeatedly issuing notifications liberalising extraction

The National Green Tribunal has issued notice to the Centre and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) following a plea seeking quashing of a notification on groundwater. The plea said that the notification did not take into account sustainable development.

A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “We are of the view that there are arguable points which are raised in the appeal which will require reconsideration.”

The Ministry of Jal Shakti and the CPCB were directed to respond within six weeks.

Taking note of the appeal, the green panel also observed that the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) had repeatedly issued notifications liberalising groundwater extraction.

Adverse effects

“Extraction for commercial purposes was adversely affecting not only the river flow but also the availability of water for drinking purposes. No effective mechanism had been set up. The CGWA was repeatedly issuing notification liberalising the groundwater extraction in the water scarcity areas in spite of need for stringent action, contrary to the very purpose for which the CGWA was set up,” the Bench observed.

In the plea, environmentalist Devi Das Khatri had contended that without any carrying capacity studies, the existing policy allows concessions to micro and small enterprises drawing groundwater.

“There is no uniform policy for monitoring groundwater recharge mechanism and to check the depleting groundwater levels in the country. Extraction thereof, has to be duly regulated,” the plea had said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ngt-issues-notice-to-centre-pollution-body-on-groundwater-extraction-plea/article32848350.ece

Three men have been arrested for allegedly beating and stabbing a 20-year-old youth to teach him a lesson for allegedly annoying their friend’s girlfriend, the police said on Tuesday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (South-East) R.P. Meena said that the injured has been identified as Rahul, resident of Taimoor Nagar. He is undergoing treatment but is said to be out of danger.

The police said the three accused identified as Ankush (19), Shahid (20) and Nikhil (19) have been arrested in connection while efforts are being made to nab prime accused Alex Thomas who stabbed Rahul and fled from the spot on October 9 at Kilokari Road.

According to the police, an information was received around 6.30 p.m. regarding a quarrel.

He also followed them to save his brother but they attacked Rahul and stabbed him, the police said.

During investigation, the accused allegedly told the police that they are friends of Alex Thomas and a few days ago, Alex told Ankush and his accomplices that Rahul was troubling his girlfriend. Therefore, they decided to teach Rahul a lesson. Around 15 days ago, when Rahul came to Kilokari — Ankush, Alex, Nikhil and Shahid had beaten him but he managed to escape, the police said.

281,2020/10/14,"Delhi, Gurugram air quality dips","Capital’s air quality likely to be in ‘poor’ to ‘ very poor’ category for next two days

The air quality of Delhi and Gurugram deteriorated on Tuesday and nearly touched the ‘very poor’ category.

According to government-run monitoring agency SAFAR, the air quality of Delhi is likely to be in the ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ category for the next two days.

North body fined

Meanwhile, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has imposed a fine of ₹20 lakh on the North Delhi Municipal Corporation for flouting dust control norms at Bhalswa landfill.

Environment Minister Gopal Rai conducted an inspection of the landfill and found “large scale violations” of the guidelines issued by the Delhi government.

“The incompetence of certain departments in tackling the problem of pollution in Delhi is visible. We have directed the DPCC to take adequate and strict action in the matter,” the Minister said.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Tuesday was 300 — on the verge of ‘very poor’ category, up from 261 (poor) on Monday, as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

The AQI in Gurugram was 288 (poor) on Tuesday, slightly up from 259 (poor) on Monday. The AQI in Noida was 286, up from 274 on Monday.

The AQI for the three cities are the average values of the past 24 hours, which is released by the CPCB at 4 pm every day, and treated as the official figure.

In Delhi, 19 out of the 34 monitoring stations were showing ‘very poor’ air quality at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, according to the CPCB. The stations with ‘very poor’ air included ITO, IGI, Wazirpur, Mundka and others.

Delhi’s air quality was expected to improve on Tuesday, but a drop in speed of local surface winds is one of the reasons for the air quality worsening.

“Though boundary layer wind direction has changed from north-westerly to easterly as predicted, the impact of disturbed wind circulation due to deep depression over west-central Bay of Bengal could not be realised in Delhi as it was expected, SAFAR said in a statement.

“In Delhi, temperature and wind speed decreased on Monday night. Also, mixing depth [the height of the atmosphere from the ground in which pollutants can be dispersed] also reduced. Due to this, the pollutants could not disperse and they accumulated,” said a SAFAR official, explaining the increase in air pollution.

“There was a rise in stubble burning fires observed on Monday around Punjab, Haryana, and neighbouring border regions with 675 fires. But the transport wind direction is unfavourable and hence, only marginal stubble contribution in PM2.5 is expected,” SAFAR said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ddvrra/article32848323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/City-choked-againcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-gurugram-air-quality-dips/article32848324.ece
282,2020/10/14,Sisodia accuses Centre of doing nothing to stop crop burning,"Minister also questions EPCA’s role

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday attacked the Central government over air pollution due to stubble burning and accused it of doing nothing throughout the year to control it.

“The Centre has completely failed to save north India from pollution. While the Delhi government works continuously to stop pollution throughout the year, the Centre sits idle,” Mr. Sisodia said, adding that increased pollution caused by stubble burning and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic make for a “dangerous combination”.

“North India is suffering from the adverse consequences of Centre’s inaction. Why does the Centre not take any steps to save the lives of the residents of north India?” he said.

Punjab villages

Mr. Sisodia said that pollution from stubble burning is not only a problem for Delhiites but also a matter of great concern for people living in Punjab villages the stubble is set on fire.

“I request the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority to look into why the Centre and other State governments do not do any work to control pollution around the year. Has the EPCA also failed to make these governments take action to control pollution? Now it seems like that,” he said.

Mr. Sisodia added that the Centre will have to take responsibility for preventing pollution throughout north India.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sisodia-accuses-centre-of-doing-nothing-to-stop-crop-burning/article32848316.ece

Chandrashekar Rao has said that the State government is ready to appoint one Horticulture Extension Officer in each mandal and assured that a huge market on 300 acres would be created at Kongarakalan to promote horticulture crops in a big way.

“Prepare proposals immediately on the number of employees needed for this. There should be special divisions in the Horticulture department headed by senior officials to bring about quality in the crops, study the changes in the cultivation patterns, to keep tabs on marketing,” he said at a review meeting.

He said Telangana was blessed with a wide variety of soil, good rainfall and professional skilled farmers and these advantages should be utilised to optimal level by bringing in revolutionary changes in the cultivation of vegetables, fruits, flowers and other horticulture crops.

KCR said there was an average rainfall of 900-1500 mm per year. All these were ideal for horticulture cultivation but despite all these advantages, the State was importing vegetables, fruits, flowers, spices, and oilseeds from other States.

“The Horticulture department should equip itself to make the State number one in cultivating the crops. Visit states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Haryana and countries like the Netherlands where horticulture crops are being cultivated very successfully,” he advised the officials, asking them to send officers to Indian Institute of Horticulture Research in Bangalore for training.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/horticulture-officials-for-all-mandals/article32856582.ece
284,2020/10/14,"Flood makes Singur surplus, likely to fill Nizamsagar too","With huge flood continuing reach Jurala-Srisailam-Nagarjunasagar-Pulichintala projects in the Krishna basin, heavy downpour in Zaheerabad area of Sangareddy district and in the neighbouring areas of Karnataka on Tuesday made the Singur project surplus and is likely to surplus Nizamsagar too over the next couple of days.

Singur and Nizamsagar have been the only projects in the Godavari basin in Telangana that remained not filled to full reservoir level this rainy season although every other project both in the Krishna and Godavari Basin became surplus several times this season. However, very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall recorded in the immediate catchment areas of the Manjira river in Telangana and Karnataka have changed the fortune of the two reservoirs overnight.

The inflows into Singur dam went beyond 90,000 cusecs and the outflows were over 60,000 cusecs on Wednesday morning as the project authorities operated the spillway gates for the first time in three years to discharge the excess flood towards Nizamsagar. As there was respite in rainfall on Wednesday, the inflows receded to about 29,000 cusecs by the evening although the engineers kept the outflows in the same measure.

Against its capacity of 29.92 tmc ft, the storage in Singur on Wednesday evening was 28.2 tmc ft and that of Nizamsagar was 11.1 tmc ft against its capacity of 17.8 tmc ft with the inflows remaining high at nearly 42,000 cusecs. Flood to Lower Manair was also very high at over 96,200 cusecs and the outflows were nearly 1.08 lakh cusecs. Inflows into Sriramsagar, Mid Manair, Kaddam and Yellampally also kept them in surplus position with continued discharge of flood.

In the Krishna basin, the inflows into Jurala were 2.65 lakh cusecs and were expected to increase further with increase in flood discharge at Narayanpur to about 1.9 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. With the supplementation from Bhima-Kagna, the flood is expected cross 3.5 lakh cusecs. The discharge from Jurala at 9 pm on Wednesday was 2.5 lakh cusecs from the spillway (37 gates) and another 21,000 cusecs after power generation.

At Srisailam, inflows were over 3.67 lakh cusecs with supplementation from Tungabhadra and Handri and the discharge was 3.76 lakh cusecs from spillway and another 27,000 cusecs from power house. At Nagarjunasagar, flood from the spillway was 2.67 lakh cusecs and another 29,000 cusecs from power house against inflows of 3.03 lakh cusecs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/flood-makes-singur-surplus-likely-to-fill-nizamsagar-too/article32856523.ece
285,2020/10/14,Power cuts make WFH tough for IT workforce,"Night shift operations severely hit

Their sense of relief at working from home (WFH) as heavy rain pounded many places in the city on Tuesday turned out to be short-lived for many in the IT workforce since little work was possible amid the accompanying power cuts.

Night shift operations were impacted, Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) president Bharani Kumar Aroll said, estimating 10% of those WFH were not able to work.

The impact of the rain on the work in IT companies during the day was not much, but things changed by the evening, he said, referring to the findings of a sample data collected by HYSEA from IT companies of varying sizes.

Power outage was not the only issue as water logging also came in the way. Many of the IT employees, however, ensured WFH by shifting to another location where power supply was available. “This morning, we worked with government on getting the power up and running [and] getting update that power was restored from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.,” he said on Wednesday.

The power cuts also saw some WFH taking to social media to highlight their plight. A resident of Madhuranagar in Yousufguda, tweeted to TSSPDCL, saying: “Hello, There is an outage even after the rain has stopped. We don't have power since last night 7 PM. Please come and fix it. Its really difficult since I am working from home I need power to work.”

Another person asked how to work from home? No light for five hrs. There is lot of pressure from company to complete work, he said in his tweet to the power utility about the power outage in Bagh-e-jahara.

For those with access to stable power connection, WFH proved to be a boon. “One big consolation is that because of Work from home, the horrors of being stuck in and around Hitech city for hours has been avoided this monsoon,” another tweet said.

In the IT hub of Hyderabad, primarily Gachibowli and neighbouring areas there was not much impact of the rain, except the power cuts. There was not much of water logging on the arterial roads, especially the stretch of Old Mumbai Highway. The compound wall of Indian Immunologicals campus was damaged at least in two places.

In the nearby Kondapur, the rain compounded the misery of road users already grappling with bad roads. Serilingampally MLA Gandhi Arekapudi also tweeted pictures of his visit to many rain affected areas, including the Serilingampally division, to monitor the flood relief measures.

The government had declared October 14 and 15 as holiday for all government offices, private institutions, including banks and financial Institutions under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, due to unprecedented incessant rains, except for the staff and offices engaged in relief and emergency services.

Sources in the banking industry, however, said it was only after 1 p.m. the order was passed on to the branches following which the facilities closed and the employees left for the day early. In State Bank of India facilities in the city, around 30-40% of the staffers were unable to attend due to rain, an official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/power-cuts-make-wfh-tough-for-it-workforce/article32856385.ece

A towel wrapped around his neck was found,” Dabeerpura Inspector Satyanarayana said. The former tahsildar was rushed to a hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.

Chanchalguda prison superintendent Srinivasulu did not respond to repeated calls on his mobile phone for further details. Nagaraju’s body was handed over to his family after performing autopsy at Osmania General Hospital morgue. Nagaraju was arrested along with two civilians and Rampur village revenue assistant Bongu Sairaj on August 14. While they came out on bail, the suspended ‘revenue officer’ was confined to prison as the ACB sleuths slapped a second case against him.

Five private persons and computer operator of Keesara Tahsil office were also arrested in the second case. This case was registered against him following a report filed by Vigilance and Enforcement (V&E) department. He was accused of illegally mutating 96.28 acres of land belonging to some persons to one Dharma Reddy and three of his family members.

In the first case, ACB sleuths took him into custody for further questioning. In the second case also, they secured his custody for three days from the court. On Monday, he was taken to ACB office for questioning and sent back to prison.

At least eight persons, including a 2-month-old infant, were killed late on Tuesday night after a portion of a large boundary wall collapsed in old city here following incessant rains that lashed the city from evening.

The tragic incident took place in Mohammadia Hills in Mohammad Nagar, under Chandrayangutta police station area. Neighbours said there were nearly eight metal-sheet roofed houses abutting the massive compound wall which was built with heavy boulders.

Part of the wall came down crashing and the boulders fell on three of the houses breaking the roofs. Hit by the boulders, eight persons died while some others were injured, the police said.

Residents of the locality said the wall was on higher ground and due to the rains which lashed the city, the debris smashed into homes below. Local police rushed to the spot and took up rescue operations with the help of municipal workers.

Hyderabad parliamentarian Asaduddin Owaisi rushed to spot. Taking to Twitter, he said that nine had lost their lives.

Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy said on Tuesday that if need arises, the MHA was ready to rush paramilitary forces, including CISF and CRPF, to assist the local authorities in relief activities.

In a statement issued late on Tuesday night, he said that IMD has issued warning to Hyderabad and nearby areas of heavy rains for the next two days. It has been raining relentlessly for the past few days in Telangana State and low lying areas have been flooded due to heavy rains.

“I request all citizens in low lying and flooded areas to stay alert and ensure no one goes out unless absolutely necessary in these rains,” he said.

291,2020/10/14,‘Chalo Assembly’ is a success: Bandi Sanjay,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has condemned the house arrest of their leaders and alleged police high-handedness at several places while preventing them from participating in the ‘Chalo Assembly’ call given on Tuesday.

The call was given alleging that the government was busy pleasing Muslims for votes, failure to construct two bedroom houses and also ‘fleecing’ people through the Land Regularisation Scheme (LRS).

In a statement here, Mr Bandi Sanjay, president of Telangana BJP, said despite the police arresting their leaders and the cadre across the State, the Chalo Assembly call was successful. He said the suppressive policies of the government were exposed yet again and it reflected the insecurity of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.

Tall promises during the elections and forgetting them conveniently later had become a habit with the TRS government, he said, adding that two lakh double bedroom houses were promised. But so far not more than 1,000 houses had been given to beneficiaries.

He said the Central government had sanctioned 2.70 lakh houses to Telangana under the Pradhanmantri Awas Yojana but the State government could not utilise the opportunity.

294,2020/10/14,Bill on quota for women in GHMC passed,"Amendments made to the 1955 Act to facilitate 50 % seats in Municipal Corporation

Fifty per cent of the 150 divisions of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation will be reserved for women henceforth.

Reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, Backward Classes and women would forthwith be fixed for two consecutive terms rather than changing the allocation for every election on rotation basis.

The schedule and date of the election will be decided by the State Election Commission in concurrence with the State government.

Amendments have been made to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955, to facilitate the changes.

The amendments include mandatory allocation of 10% of budget for green initiatives and fixing responsibility on ward/division members and nodal officers to survival rate of 85 per cent of the total plantations.

The Legislative Assembly on Tuesday passed the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (amendment) Act, 2020. Piloting the Bill in the House, Municipal Administration Minister K. T. Rama Rao said the decision to fix reservations for two terms had been made to ensure continuity and focused approach towards development.

The amendment was made with retrospective effect from 2016 and hence, the same reservation pattern would continue for the forthcoming elections to GHMC.

Subsequent polls

“Reservations will be decided afresh from the subsequent election to the GHMC,” he said.

He recalled that the Telangnaa Rashtra Samithi government had implemented 50% quota for women through an executive order in the past GHMC elections and this was being followed by the legislation now. “In fact, the TRS fielded 79 women in the past elections and ensured their victory,” he said.

In addition to the amendments, the government was committed to putting in place participatory democracy in the functioning of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and hence, it was decided to constitute four ward/division level committees comprising women, youth, senior citizens and eminent citizens.

These committees would be apolitical and would meet every three months to discuss the developments in their areas.

The advices/suggestions given by these committees with 25 members each would be discussed at the Council meetings and would be appropriately adopted. “This will be a people’s army of 15,000 covering various aspects of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) development. These committees are aimed at ensuring participatory development,” he said.

The committees were envisaged to put a check on illegal constructions, encroachments and consumption of plastics besides furthering green initiatives.

“They will not, however, intrude on the functioning of the corporators,” he averred.

Replying to a query by CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka on the 33% quota for BCs, he said the government would take steps to ensure that the 33% quota would not be disturbed. Asked about the Building Regularisation Scheme, he said the government had received 1.13 lakh applications so far, but the process was stopped after the High Court imposed a stay.

“We are trying our best to vacate the stay at the earliest,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/luof0n/article31025748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10ASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bill-on-quota-for-women-in-ghmc-passed/article32848241.ece
295,2020/10/14,NephroPlus acquires 51% stake in Philippines firm RCDC,"Dialysis service provider NephroPlus has acquired a 51% stake in Royal Care Dialysis Centers Inc (RCDC), a firm in the Philippines, for an undisclosed sum.

Announcing the deal and plans to acquire an additional 25% stake in the firm in the next few years, NephroPlus founder and CEO Vikram Vuppala said the company was in discussion with several dialysis centers in Philippines to fuel expansion plans. RCDC has six dialysis clinics located in Metro Manila and other nearby provinces and currently treats over 400 patients.

“With this entry into Philippines, we reiterate our commitment to build a dominant multinational network across Asia, Middle East and CIS geographies,” he said, adding the market for the services in the Philippines is estimated to be $400 million. Through this deal, NephroPlus will be responsible for the network’s existing operations and will lend all its India-based protocols, technologies and operational expertise to RCDC with an aim to improve dialysis care in the Philippines. As part of company's overseas expansion strategy, NephroPlus aims to expand the services in other provinces and grow this network to 50 dialysis centers in next five years to be the dominant dialysis network in the Philippines by 2025, a release said.

NephroPlus, which operates 225 across many States in India, plans to invest $15-20 million in 4-5 years in the Philippines, he said.

Royal Care Dialysis Network founder Sunil Chellani said NephroPlus bring in over a decade long experience of operating dialysis centres and introduced many first time SOPs and innovations in the Indian dialysis ecosystem. “With this partnership, we are confident that we will grow to become the dominant dialysis network in Philippines in 4 – 5 years,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nephroplus-acquires-51-stake-in-philippines-firm-rcdc/article32848195.ece
296,2020/10/14,Land conversion to be online,"Amendments to ensure transparency, says Minister

Continuing its spree of reforms in the Revenue administration, the State government has decided to make the entire process relating to conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes online.

Accordingly, applicants should forthwith file applications for conversion online and the conversion process would be carried out seamlessly through the Dharani, the integrated land records management system portal. On completion of conversion, the land would instantly be entered electronically into Dharani non-agricultural portal.

The Legislative Assembly passed the Telangana Agricultural Land (Conversion for non-agricultural purposes) (Amendment) Act, 2020 on Tuesday.

Legislative Affairs Minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy, who piloted the Bill on behalf of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao in the House, said the amendments were aimed at increasing transparency in revenue administration.

The changes would ensure hassle-free revenue administration public interest and result in evolving good practices to end corruption.

The Bills were contemplated in view of the problems encountered in the conversion process which left discretionary powers with officials.

Discrepancies

The Revenue Divisional Officer who was competent authority received the applications and discrepancies were noticed in the collection of conversion charges. There was huge pendency of applications as well as dues to the tune of ₹826 crore payable on account of conversions pending to the government. The existing laws mandated effective coordination between the Revenue, Panchayat Raj and Municipal Administration departments and this was resulting in delays in effecting conversions.

There was no mechanism to check these aspects in the past and hence, it was decided to simply the provisions in the Act and make it more transparent.

The government had therefore decided to ensure time-slot based conversions by hosting the entire process online. Accordingly, the conversion process would be completed the same day along with mutation and the document of ownership would be handed over to the parties concerned. The government had already posted data pertaining to 95% of the lands, 1.48 crore acres on Dharani portal.

Congress member Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, however, expressed doubts over the veracity of the records entered into Dharani portal, claiming that allowing wrong entries would result in chaos in the coming days.

The State government should therefore complete the survey and settlement of the entire land across the State before making the processes online, the Congress leader said.

“Entry of wrong information will lead to issuance of wrong certificates more than once. This needs to be avoided,” he said.

Mr. Prashanth Reddy, however, said since the survey and settlement process would take more than a year, the government had decided to ensure the data was hosted online in the land administration processes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/land-conversion-to-be-online/article32848193.ece

The approval given by Union Finance Minister to register a case against B. Srinivasa Gandhi, superintendent in GST Hyderabad office, was legal, the CBI said in Telangana High Court on Tuesday.

In a counter affidavit to Mr. Gandhi’s writ petition questioning the Union Minister’s approval for CBI investigation against him, the CBI authorities said the approval was justified. They said Mr. Gandhi claimed that he was a Group-B officer and Central Tax Commissioner was his disciplinary authority. Only the latter can approve a case of corruption against him under service rules, Mr. Gandhi stated in his petition.

It was a settled principle of law that an authority higher to the disciplinary authority can exercise the latter’s power. In Mr. Gandhi’s case, the Union Minister is a higher authority to Central Tax Commissioner and has the power to approve the investigation, the CBI officials said in the counter affidavit.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/oav8sv/article32726441.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY30HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/permission-for-prosecution-was-legal-cbi/article32848176.ece
298,2020/10/14,‘Agriculture card’ from next year,"It will have dos and dont’s on cultivation of crops

The State Government is planning to introduce “agriculture card” with “dos and don’ts” for farmers from the next agricultural year.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has asked the officials of the Agriculture department to prepare the agriculture card with advisory to the farming community as to which crops they could cultivate keeping the market conditions in mind and which crops they could not raise from the next agricultural year.

At a review meeting held with senior officials of the department, including District Agriculture Officers (DAOs) here on Tuesday, he said the time had come wherein the employees of the Agriculture Department were expected to act as companions of farmers to make the livelihood-cum-economic activity profitable.

Minister for Agriculture Singireddy Niranjan Reddy, Rythu Bandhu Samithi (RBS) chairman Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, MPs G. Ranjith Reddy and B. Lingaiah Yadav, legislators Seri Subhash Reddy, A. Jeevan Reddy, Guvvala Balaraju, Balka Suman, K. Bhupal Reddy, B. Shankar Naik, Ch. Lingaiah, Chief Advisor Rajeev Sharma, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, and Agriculture Secretary B. Janarthan Reddy attended the meeting.

The Chief Minister made it clear at the meeting that farmers could raise maize crop at their own risk and if they were ready to sell the product only up to ₹900 per quintal as the prevailing marketing conditions would leave no scope for the crop to get better price. Stating that the farmers were getting accustomed to regulated farming with the experience of just one season, he said it was the responsibility of the officials to guide them from time to time to get better yields and better marketing practices.

He asked the agricultural officials at field level to educate farmers about the facts surrounding maize cultivation so that they could voluntarily decide on not cultivating the crop in Yasangi season too. He asked the officials not to take their job as 10-am-to-5-pm work but a continuous process and instructed them to complete Rythu Vedikas by Dasara.

Further, the Chief Minister instructed the officials to fill the vacancies in the department, stating that it was the most dynamic and happening department in the State machinery now.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/agriculture-card-from-next-year/article32848171.ece

301,2020/10/14,Help pours in for transwoman after ill-treatment,"Minister offers support through We Care Project

Close on the heels of a vendor allegedly stopping a transwomen from selling biriyani packets on the roadside at Irumpanam, Thripunithura, on Monday, help is pouring in from all quarters, including the Social Welfare Department, for the community. Actor Jayasurya too has come forward, offering to set up a biriyani shop for members of the community.

Sajana Shaji, a transwoman, was reportedly assaulted and verbally abused by the vendor. A native of Kottayam, Sajana graduated from Maharaja’s College and has been living in Kochi for the past 13 years. After initially eking out a living by begging in trains, she turned to selling food on the wayside. A video of Sajana breaking down after the alleged assault had gone viral.

Minister for Health and Social Welfare K.K. Shylaja spoke to Sajana over phone and promised all help from the Social Welfare Department through its We Care Project. She said members of the community too enjoyed the same rights as those of others. The State government has issued identity cards to them, besides formulating a TG Policy aimed at their upliftment. Attacks on them can never be tolerated, the Minister said. Thripunithura MLA M. Swaraj was among those who offered help to Sajana.

Arrested

Meanwhile, the Thripunithura police arrested Girish, 48, of Eroor under the provisions of the Transgender Persons Protection of Rights Act. He was also charged with assault and use of abusive words against the complainant, the police said. Thripunithura Sub Inspector Ramu Balachandra Bose denied the allegation that the police did not promptly act on the vendor’s complaint. “We made the mandatory preliminary enquiry and arrested the person who has been charged under relevant provisions of the Transgender Persons Protection of Rights Act. This is perhaps the first time in Kerala that the Act is being invoked to charge a criminal case. We have assured all protection to TG vendors. The police here are severely short-staffed, as seven personnel have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while 15 are in quarantine,” he said.

At the same time, allegation is rife that transwoman vendors were singled out for action by the health wing of the Thripunithura Municipality. The Congress sought action against the police for what it alleged as tardy response. “The assault is a blot on our culture,” said Raju P. Nair, DCC secretary. Party workers also helped transwoman sell biriyani packets on Tuesday. A biriyani fest will be held shortly, where 2,000 packets of biriyani prepared by transwoman will be sold, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/h32ocz/article32848707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sajana-shaji,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/help-pours-in-for-transwoman-after-ill-treatment/article32848708.ece
302,2020/10/14,City to commemorate 175th year of Elementary School,"The institution heralded modern system of education in Cochin State

The city is all set to celebrate the proud history of the English Elementary School founded in 1845.

The institution, which heralded the modern system of education in the erstwhile Cochin State, had started functioning in a single thatched room on what is today the campus of Maharaja’s College, Ernakulam, in 1845.

The erstwhile Maharaja of the Cochin State and then Dewan Sankara Warrier had taken the initiative to open the school. It was converted into a high school in 1868. The school was upgraded to a college in 1875 before it became Maharaja’s College in 1925. The school was handed over to the government post-Independence, and it attained popularity as SRV High School.

Organisers of the 175th year celebrations of the school said both SRV High School and Maharaja’s College continued to remain active in the socio-political sphere of the State. Many illustrious personalities have come out of the campus to take up major roles in various arenas.

The celebrations will be jointly organised by the representatives of SRV School, Maharaja’s College and the Ernakulam Public Library. An organising committee comprising illustrious teachers like M.K. Sanoo and M. Leelavathi has been formed.

303,2020/10/14,PVS COVID-19 hospital in need of critical care,"Facility relying on donations to meet daily expenses

PVS Hospital that was resuscitated by the district administration and repurposed into a treatment centre for critically ill COVID-19 patients, is now relying mostly on donations to meet daily expenses and replace a defunct CT scan facility.

While the facility has the capacity to accommodate 120 patients, only 56 beds have been made functional in the six months since it was taken over by the administration in March. A total of 49 patients, mostly category C patients identified on the basis of severity of symptoms or those patients who might quickly progress to category C, are admitted at the centre.

Defunct facility

Though the hospital treats critically ill patients, a functional CT scan system is not available, said Dr. Junaid Rahman, former president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Kochi chapter, and a member of the district programme management and supporting unit set up to coordinate work related to hospitals, ambulances and treatment centres for COVID-19 care. While some supplies and basic medicines are procured through Kerala Medical Services Corporation Limited, others like antivirals have been adding to the hospital’s mounting daily expenses, he said. A functional CT scan facility could cost over ₹50 lakh, he added.

Daily expenses are largely met through donations from corporate entities, said Dr. N.K. Kuttappan, District Medical Officer. A request has been placed for finances under the State Disaster Response Fund, but it has not been sanctioned yet, he said. Once more beds are put to use, expenses will rise, he said.

“Daily expenses now stand at over ₹8 lakh with about 50 patients. The amount is cobbled together from various sponsors. Others have contributed with ventilators and equipment like fans,” Dr. Rahman said. “A consistent funding source would have been ideal for this facility. The administration has only taken the hospital over temporarily while the property is still caught in litigation,” he added.

Support sought

“We need support from the general public to procure additional equipment like monitors, ventilators, infusion pumps and defibrilators to equip the centre with more ICU facilities. With the surge in cases in Ernakulam, the number of hospital beds for category C patients will have to be augmented,” said an official.

“We are working on funding. The hospital has been running for over a month now and about 110 patients have been treated so far at a facility that had been lying defunct. The few initial hiccups can be tided over. The government is paying staff salaries, besides some funds that came in earlier for the repairs,” he said. At the hospital, health workers have been appointed from the government service and from a pool of staff under the National Health Mission.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/z2r743/article32848460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14-KI-PVS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pvs-covid-19-hospital-in-need-of-critical-care/article32848461.ece

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the Champakkara Bridge on the Vyttila-Pettah road on Thursday.

It was built by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC) for Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL). The bridge was reconstructed as four lane, in place of a two-lane bridge that existed earlier.

The pair of two-lane bridges, one of which was opened to traffic a year ago, was constructed across the National Waterway 3, across the Champakkara Canal, says a KMRL release.

305,2020/10/14,Mamata Banerjee inaugurates virtual Durga Pujas,"PIL in High Court seeks deferment of Durga Puja in the wake of COVID-19

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday inaugurated several Durga Pujas in five districts of north Bengal virtually from the State Secretariat. Other than the virtual inauguration, she inaugurated two big budget Durga Pujas in the city by visiting the venue.

In the next few days, Ms. Banerjee will inaugurate Durga Pujas in different parts of the city. Clubs have been asked to send applications to the Chief Minister’s Office to book a slot for virtual inauguration.

During the inauguration, Ms Banerjee urged people to maintain the COVID-19 protocol and directed the police to release the funds for organising Durga Puja to different clubs. The government has decided to pay ₹50,000 to about 37,000 clubs in the State that organise Durga Puja.

While the COVID-19 pandemic in the State is showing no signs of easing, the political parties are using this as an opportunity to connect to people. The BJP’s State unit is organising a Durga Puja at Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre in Salt Lake. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to virtually inaugurate the Durga Puja on October 22.

Petition hearing on Friday

Meanwhile, a public interest litigation petition was filed in the Calcutta High Court seeking a deferment of the Durga Puja in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. The petition refers to how festivals in States such as Kerala and Maharashtra had resulted in spike in cases. The matter will come up for hearing on Friday.

In another development centred on Durga Puja, authorities of the Kolkata Metro indicated that they are not contemplating running overnight trains during the Puja.

309,2020/10/14,Public urged to join ‘Prathishedha Jwala’,"Statewide protest condemning violence against women, minorities

A collective of women’s organisations and individuals working for human rights in the State has called upon the public to be part of a protest titled ‘Laksham Prathishedha Jwala’ on November 1, the day of Kerala Piravi, across the State. The protest is being organised as a response to sexual crimes against women, and violence against Dalits, tribespeople, sexual minorities and other minority communities across the country. The event is being organised against the backdrop of the alleged rape and murder of a Dalit woman at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh recently.

M. Sulfath, one of the organisers of the event, pointed out that the mother of the two girls who were raped and murdered in Valayar last year was still seeking justice on the streets. “Girls who are attacked even at schools are further subjected to administrative violence when they seek justice. Even when attacks against Dalits and adivasis are on the rise, the police help culprits escape,” she said in a press release.

The ‘Prathishedha Jwala’ will be organised in adherence to COVID protocol from 6 p.m. onwards. Individuals and groups can organise the protest by lighting lamps on the streets, workplaces or at homes. Dalit, adivasi and queer organisations will join the protest in different parts of the State.

The protests will be led by noted activists including K. Ajitha, Sheethal Shyam, Ammini Wayanad, Gomathi.G, Ramseena Umaiba, Jyothi Narayanan, P.

310,2020/10/14,KIIFB nod for slaughterhouse project,"Tender proceedings for the proposed state-of-the-art slaughterhouse of the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation may begin in a month’s time as the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) has finally given nod to the project. The KIIFB had earlier returned the proposal for the project seeking further clarification in the detailed project report (DPR) and a soil test report. Corporation Secretary Binu Francis said that most of the hurdles before the much awaited project had been cleared and that it could be implemented soon.

The ₹9.5-crore slaughterhouse project at Kothi was included in the Kozhikode Corporation’s project Plan for the year 2019-20 and was also part of the corporation’s Mission 360, a set of projects that the present council is expected to complete within its tenure.

The Kozhikode District Committee of the All Kerala Meat Merchants’ Association had earlier protested against the delay in implementing the project.

The association had been demanding the slaughterhouse for over a decade as the city lacked proper and hygienic slaughter facilities. Even though corporation councillors were supportive, the project hit a roadblock when people at Kothi, known for their love for football, launched a protest against the corporation’s takeover of their football ground for the slaughterhouse project. However, the corporation offered to provide another playground and settled the issue.

Mr. Francis said that the project now needed only a few approvals including building permit and fire permit besides an MoU with Impact Kerala.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kiifb-nod-for-slaughterhouse-project/article32854233.ece

The Kozhikode district administration is planning to throw open all its tourism destinations by the first week of November, and in the first phase, Sarovaram Bio Park in the city will be opened to the public within a week.

District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) Secretary C.P. Beena said strict regulations would be put in place at the park to make it safe for the public in the backdrop of the pandemic. “Ticketing will be made online as far as possible. We will set up a QR code for payment at the counters at Sarovaram,” Ms. Beena said.

In keeping with the COVID-19 protocol, sanitisers and masks will be made mandatory. “The park will run in two shifts, one from 9 a.m. to noon and another from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. The break in between will be used to sanitise the park,” she added.

Only 100 people will be allowed inside the park at a time, while a person cannot stay inside for more than one hour. Also, groups of more than five persons will not be entertained, as Section 144 is in place in the district.

The district administration had a plan to open the Sargaalaya Arts and Crafts Village along with Sarovaram, but it could not be done, as a COVID-19 treatment centre is functioning at Sargaalaya. “It will take time to make the place suitable to entertain tourists,” Ms. Beena said.

314,2020/10/14,‘We are yet to trace accused’,"Madurai District Police are yet to trace the accused in two murder cases reported in rural district limits in the last few days, SP Sujit Kumar said here on Wednesday.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Sujit Kumar said police had vital clues in the double murder of Kunnathur panchayat president R. Krishnarajan and pump operator A. Munisamy on Monday.

A case of rioting had been booked against 20 persons who ransacked the house of former panchayat president Tirupathi and secretary Palpandi alias Veeranan suspecting them to be behind the double murder. Meanwhile, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes has sought a report on the case.

On the murder at Soolapuram, the SP said though locals alleged it to be the handiwork of people belonging to another caste, investigation was still going on.

On Anaikaraipatti villagers’ demand for action against police officials for ‘custodial death’ of a youth last month, he said re-post-mortem had been done and the report would be sent to the High Court.

On revocation of the suspension of two Sub-Inspectors accused in the case, the SP said punishment would be based on the outcome of the investigation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/we-are-yet-to-trace-accused/article32856447.ece
315,2020/10/14,Villagers hold protest against murder,"Scores of villagers on Wednesday refused to allow the police to take the body of S. Chelladurai, 43, who was hacked to death at Soolapuram near Usilampatti the previous night, to hospital for postmortem.

The victim’s wife, Malarkodi, said they were waylaid while returning home after offering worship at Chellandiamman temple in their village. An armed gang attacked her husband and murdered him near Santhanamariamman temple at Ulaipatti around 8 p.m.

As soon as news of the murder spread, scores of villagers gathered at the spot and staged a protest demanding arrest of the accused who belonged to a rival group.

According to police, after a stone-pelting incident reported at the temple festival last year, Usilampatti Revenue Divisional Officer V. Rajkumar called for a peace meeting in which caste Hindus and SC members participated.

While the SC members demanded that they be allowed inside the temple during the festival to offer worship, the caste Hindus objected.

The RDO denied permission to hold the festival. Only the ritual of madhu kudam was allowed as villagers feared that stopping the ritual might bring bad omen to the village.

Tuesday’s murder took place in this backdrop. Malarkodi accused over 10 persons, including N. Thangappan of the SC community, for the murder, police said.

After police officials pacified the villagers, the body was taken to government hospital in Usilampatti in the afternoon. However, the villagers said they would not allow postmortem till a family member of the deceased was given a government job and they were paid compensation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/villagers-hold-protest-against-murder/article32856173.ece

The Tamil Nadu Startup and Innovation Policy 2018-2023 promises to establish, support infrastructure and strengthen existing mechanism in thrust areas such as internet of things (IOT) and artificial intelligence (AI), according to Revenue, Disaster Management & IT Minister R.B. Udayakumar.

Inaugurating the ITCA Academy of TN Global Technology Forum 2020 through video-conference at the Collectorate here on Wednesday, he said the State was a leader in the country in e-governance, IT and BPM exports, presence of globally recognised software as a service (SAAS) companies, attracting investments and creating jobs. Even during a pandemic, the State government signed MoUs worth more than ₹20,000 crore and launched block chain policy, ethical AI and cyber security policy to ensure safety of digital mode.

Mr. Udayakumar said the commissionerate of e-governance had taken a few initiatives in the State including Arasu e-seva centre, Makkal number and Amma e-grammam.

Lauding the Centre of Excellence in Emerging Technologies (CEET), the Minister said detecting internal bleedings under CEET from CT scan, identification of pest, diseases and nutrient deficiency of crop using AI, computer vision based attendance system, State family database, creating a chatbot for facilitating delivery of government services to the citizens were some of the projects undertaken.

The CEET was created only in January 2019 and, within a short period, the government had been able to penetrate into key areas. The objective was to bridge the knowledge gap between development and application of emerging technologies in various government departments.

The Minister also said the State government was the first to sign an MoU and collaborate with a premier research institute like the IIT Madras for harnessing the power of AI and block chain technology in areas of health, education and agriculture.

In a brief interaction with media persons, Mr. Udayakumar said the north-east monsoon was set to begin on October 20. All 38 districts in the State had been instructed to take measures, and Collector-level preparedness meetings had been held.

“The official machinery is geared to tackle emergencies that may arise out of the monsoon,” he responded to a specific query.

He said there was an additional 24% rainfall from the south-west monsoon, which had greatly benefitted agriculture operations in many districts across the State. The water bodies that were desilted would be able to conserve water for irrigation and drinking purposes.

The government had formed zonal-level groups to handle the situation. The weather forecast suggested that there would be moderate rainfall in southern parts of the State and heavy to very heavy rain in some northern parts of Tamil Nadu. All hill stations were also being closely watched, Mr. Udayakumar added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/5t2szg/article32856035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15-UDAYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tamil-nadu-startup-policy-promises-to-establish-iot-ai-minister/article32856036.ece

THENI

Appealing to officers and executives from industrial organisations to continue to be guarded while handling people in the covid-19 pandemic times, Collector M Pallavi Baldev said on Wednesday that the standard operating procedure (SOP) should be adhered to strictly in all public places.

Interacting with senior officers and representatives from the trade and industry body, she said that workers engaged in industries, including agro-based ones and in construction activities, should be thoroughly screened/scanned prior to permitting them inside the campuses.

By adhering to the SOP, the virus can be distanced. Moreover, people could swiftly revive and reconstruct the economy, if they were healthy, Ms. Baldev said and recalled the crucial times experienced by the officials, doctors and frontline workers some three months back.

Thanks to the efforts, the district has been facing a declining trend, but she underlined that the administration wouldn't relax, but be more vigilant for the next 100 days.

Ramanathapuram

Echoing similar views, Ramanathapuram Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that over the last two months, they had tested 94,724 people out of which 5,797 had tested positive. So far, the district had discharged 5,489 till date and only 186 were active cases of covid-19.

The Collector, while speaking to reporters after inaugurating the Cooptex sale for the ensuing Deepavali, said that the sustained efforts by the teams facilitated in bringing down the positive cases.

The feedback collected from patients in the isolation wards in hospitals helped to rectify and improve in the functioning of the administration. The containment plans too worked well as the fever cases or other ailments were identified much earlier, Mr. Rao said and added that the northeast monsoon may be another testing time for the officials.

318,2020/10/14,HC seeks State’s response on quota for govt. school students,"Bill provides for 7.5 % horizontal reservation for them in medical admission

MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday sought the State government’s response on the decision taken with regard to implementation of 7.5 % horizontal reservation for government school students who cleared National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) in medical admission.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that a decision had to be taken with respect to implementation of the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Indian Medicine and Homeopathy on Preferential Basis to Students of Government Schools Bill, 2020.

The court said the Bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly unanimously on September 15 and sent to the Governor for his assent on the very same day. However, it had been pending for one month without any decision being taken on it. A decision had to be taken at the earliest, the judges said.

The judges pointed out that as per the data available only three, five and six students from government schools got admission in medical colleges in 2017-2018, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 respectively. NEET results were to be published on October 16.

If no decision was taken with regard to reservation for government school students, definitely less number of students would get admission and the interests of the students of government schools would be affected, the judges said, and directed the State to respond on October 16.

The court was hearing a batch of public interest litigation petitions which sought a direction to the State to implement horizontal reservation for government school students as recommended by the commission headed by retired High Court Judge P. Kalaiyarasan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-seeks-states-response-on-quota-for-govt-school-students-madurai/article32855996.ece

The District Consumer Redressal Forum has ordered the Tamil Nadu Generation Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) to pay ₹ 22,277 for failing to repay the excess amount collected from a consumer after fitting faulty meter in his house.

When the TANGEDCO fixed new meter in the house of R. Abubucker Siddique, 32, of Kodeeswaran Nagar in Tirunelveli Town, the new meter showed 1,000 units even when it was installed in March, 2019. As the first reading from the new meter was taken in May, 2019, the TANGEDCO staff marked the reading as 1,358 even as the consumption was only 358 units.

When Mr. Abubucker pointed out this error to the TANGEDCO’s Assistant Engineer, Pettai, he reportedly admitted to the error after cross-checking the consumer’s version with the computer readings in his office. Though the official assured to fix the technical issue, it was not resolved forcing the consumer to approach the Executive Engineer (Tirunelveli Urban) and then the Superintending Engineer in search of a remedy.

Meanwhile, the consumer was asked to pay ₹ 3,496 before October 17, 2019 and he had to pay the amount in a bid to save the power connection to his house.

Though Mr. Abubucker had to run from pillar to post for five months, no official from TANGEDCO was prepared to help him out, forcing him to approach the district consumer redressal forum. Even after the legal notice was served, the Superintending Engineer, Executive Engineer and the Assistant Engineer, Pettai, replied that they would confirm first that if the meter was really faulty and adjust the amount in the subsequent months.

Though the faulty meter was replaced by another meter, the issue remained unresolved. When the case came up before the forum, none from TANGEDCO turned up forcing the forum to decide the case based on the evidence submitted by the aggrieved petitioner.

Accordingly, the forum directed the three officials to pay the compensation of ₹ 15,000, ₹ 2,277 towards the excess charge collected from the consumer and ₹ 5,000 as cost.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/forum-orders-tangedco-to-pay-compensation-to-consumer/article32855974.ece

322,2020/10/14,Farmers oppose setting up of solar power plant,"Aruppukottai

Scores of farmers and villagers around Nandhikundu staged a road blockade on Virudhunagar-Kalkurichi highway near Mallankinaru protesting against an entrepreneur “attempting” to block supply channels and common pathway to farmlands on Wednesday.

The protest was led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) district secretary V. Murugan. The farmers along with their tractors blocked the road.

“An individual from Dindigul has bought around 40 acres of land in the western side of Nandhikundu. He has proposed to set up a solar power plant which our farmers have been protesting for more than a month,” he said.

Stating that around 200 acres of farmland was behind the proposed power plant site, the villagers said that on fencing the land, their pathway to the farms and a temple would be blocked.

Besides, the waterway draining rainwater from Azhagiyanallur to Nandikundu tank and ooranis in Melathulukkankulam and Keezhathulukkanlukam would be blocked.

Aruppukottai Town Inspector of Police Balamurugan and Kariyapatti Tahsildar R. Dhanakumar held talks with the protesters.

“The entrepreneur has just submitted his application for setting up the power plant. We have advised him not to take up any construction till he gets his plan approved by the Nandhikundu panchayat,” the Tahsildar said.

All the six cement pipelines that were laid to construct a small culvert over a supply channel were removed.

Mr. Murugan said that a dispute over the land transaction within the 40 acres was pending in court.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/l12m49/article32855291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15VNR-FARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/farmers-oppose-setting-up-of-solar-power-plant/article32855292.ece

324,2020/10/14,Farmers hopeful of good pisanam paddy season,"TIRUNELVELI

Farmers of the district are hopeful of having good harvest in the ‘pisanam’ paddy season this year as the northeast monsoon is likely to start in October-end or the first week of November even as all prime dams of Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts have decent storage level.

Though the northeast monsoon would start in mid-October, there is no sign of the monsoon starting before the end of this month after a low pressure in the Bay of Bengal disturbed the ‘weather system’ usually forms before the onset of the monsoon.

Unexpectedly, unseasonal rain drenches the areas close to the Western Ghats for the past two days even as other parts of Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts are desperately waiting for good showers. Consequently, the dams in both the districts have started receiving good influx of water.

As the catchment areas of Papanasam dam experienced decent rainfall of 64 mm on Wednesday, the reservoir had an influx of 4,893 cusecs to jack up the dam’s water level from yesterday’s 89.15 feet to today’s 94.30 feet against the maximum capacity of 143 feet. The relatively small Servalar dam’s water level rose from 102 feet to 113 feet against its maximum capacity of 153 feet.

However, water level in Manimuthar dam did not witness any significant rise on Wednesday as the catchment area had the precipitation of only 17 mm. This largest dam of the district is expected to experience significant rise in water level on Thursday since it was getting 1,230 cusecs on Wednesday.

After the 52 mm rainfall in its catchment areas, the Adavinainar dam at Maekkarai in Tenkasi district reached 132.10 feet against its maximum capacity of 132.22 feet on Wednesday even as it was getting 179 cusecs of water. Moreover, water level in other dams in Tenkasi district such as Gadana, Ramanadhi and Karuppanadhi are just a few feet away from the maximum capacity even as all the 3 dams are getting decent influx of water heralding that these reservoirs would reach the maximum storage level within a day or two.

All waterfalls in Courtallam – Main Falls, Old Courtallam, Tiger Falls and Five Falls – were flowing menacingly since Tuesday afternoon following rain along the Western Ghats. Since the tourists are not allowed to take bath in the waterfalls ever since COVID-19-induced lockdown was clamped, Courtallam is wearing a deserted look now.

However, the salubrious weather laced with breeze and drizzle enthralls the residence living close to the Western Ghats. The unexpected rain also brings decent influx of water into the system tanks situated along the Chittar watercourse, promising the farmers of good pisanam paddy season.

Since all the dams in both Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts have decent storage level even before the onset of northeast monsoon, the farmers are hopeful of enjoying good ‘pisanam’ season this year.

“Though water level in all the dams in Tenkasi district was comfortable in mid-August and September, most of the farmers did not go in for ‘kar’ paddy cultivation this year as the delayed farming operations would land them in trouble with the paddy ready for harvest in November-end or December wherein northeast monsoon will be at its best. Since storage in the dams is very encouraging, farmers will have bumper crop in ‘pisanam’ season and may go in for ‘advance kar’ paddy cultivation also in next February,” said farmer S.T. Shaik Mohideen of Vadakarai.

Rainfall in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts (in mm):

Papanasam Dam – 64, Kodumudiyar Dam – 60, Adavinainar Dam – 52, Servalar Dam – 42, Ramanadhi Dam – 40, Tenkasi – 31, Gundar Dam – 27, Manimuthar, Karuppanadhi and Gadana Dams – 17, Shencottai – 11, Aayikudi – 10.40, Radhapuram – 10, Kalakkad – 6.20, Moolaikkaraipatti – 5, Nanguneri – 4, Ambasamudram – 3, Cheranmahadevi – 2.40, Sivagiri, Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai – 1.

Water level in dams (in feet – maximum capacity in brackets): Gadana – 76.70 (85), Ramanadhi – 76.50 (84), Karuppanadhi – 68.02 (72), Gundar – 36.10 (36.10), Adavinainar – 132.10 (132.22).",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/73w2jp/article32854389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15TVL-FALLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/farmers-hopeful-of-good-pisanam-paddy-season/article32854390.ece
325,2020/10/14,10-year-old elephant found dead near Manimuthar dam,"TIRUNELVELI

A 10-year-old female elephant, which was spotted roaming along the periphery of the forest near Manimuthar dam in the Western Ghats for a couple of days, was found dead in a private farm at South Pappankulam on Wednesday.

When the farmers of Pottal and Therkku Pappankulam near Manimuthar dam in the district spotted the elephant roaming close to their now empty ranches near the reservoir on the lap of the Western Ghats a couple of days ago, they alerted the Kalakkad – Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR) officials.

After assessing the animal’s condition from close quarters, the KMTR team placed food stuffed with medicines in the areas where the elephant was moving around.

Since the pachyderm could not walk fast and did not take food or water, the animal’s condition deteriorated further. The elephant was found dead in the farm of Sudalaikannu of Therkku Pappankulam on Wednesday.

On getting information, the KMTR officials, including Deputy Director of KMTR’s Ambasamudram Division Kommu Omkaram arrived at the spot with forest veterinarian Manoharan to conduct on-the-spot post-mortem to ascertain the cause of the death.

Mr. Omkaram told The Hindu that a team of KMTR personnel had been deployed in Pottal and Therkku Pappankulam area on getting information about the elephant sluggishly moving near the now empty paddy fields.

Though the food stuffed with medicines was placed at several points, the animal did not take any food.

“There is no possibility of starvation death as food and water are abundantly available in this region. We, during the post-mortem, could see the elephant, having infection in the mouth, had consumed palm fruits, but could not digest it. The infection in the digestive system might have caused the death. Anyway, we can come to a conclusion only after getting the post-mortem report,” said Mr. Omkaram.

He added that the organs of the animal were intact and the pathologist, who was part of the post-mortem team, alone could identify the type of infection that had caused the death.

The Deputy Director also ruled out the chances of the animal being poisoned for having invaded into the fields, saying that all the paddy fields in this region were empty now as harvest had been completed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/a4vhxy/article32854183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15TVL-ELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/10-year-old-elephant-found-dead-near-manimuthar-dam/article32854184.ece

330,2020/10/14,Alake Market building inaugurated,"Karangalpady and Car Street markets to be upgraded; Urwa Market to be commissioned shortly

The Karangalpady and Car Street markets in the city will be upgraded as modern facilities, according to MLA from Mangaluru City South D. Vedavyasa Kamath.

Speaking at a function here on Tuesday, after inaugurating the Alake market building built by the Mangaluru City Corporation at an estimated cost of ₹ 1.40 crore, the MLA said that the new Urwa Market building will be commissioned shortly by the city corporation after taking the market building into possession from Mangaluru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) which has built it.

The Alake market has been built on 536.19 sq m area. It has provision for 40 stalls/rooms. Of these, six stalls are for selling vegetables, four each (12, in all) are for general items, fruits and flowers, respectively.

In addition, it has two stalls each for selling mutton and dry fish. The market has one stall each for selling beef and pork. It has 12 stalls for selling fresh fish.

The market has one room each for maintenance, office, generator set and for electrical panels.

A corporation official said that the market has been provided with power supply, water supply and underground drainage connection.

The funds for the construction work were drawn from different sources. The official said that ₹ 50 lakh each has been drawn from the Chief Minister’s Nagarottana special grant and from the enterprise fund of the city corporation. Of the balance amount, ₹ 30 lakh has been drawn from Mangaluru City South MLA’s Area Development grant, and ₹ 10.40 lakh was contributed by the city corporation.

Mr. Kamath, without naming any party or government, said that the previous administration had laid foundation stones for some projects in the city without reserving enough funds for completing them. The present administration now will have to focus on completing the works by allocating the required funds.

He said that issues in the financial allocation for completing works on the Kankanady and Kadri (Mallikatta) markets will be addressed at the earliest.

331,2020/10/14,CAMPCO Ltd. steps up arecanut procurement,"Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative (CAMPCO) Ltd. has stepped up procuring arecanut stocks from the doorsteps of its member-farmers on an experimental basis, according to president of the cooperative S.R. Satishchandra. It purchased about 5,000 quintals from the houses of 200 farmers in Vitla and Puttur areas recently, he said.

He told The Hindu that many farmers are facing the issue of lack of farm workers to pack, load and transport the produce to the nearest procurement centres. Such farmers, of which some are aged above 60, who have related issues, have called the cooperative asking whether it was possible to collect their produce. Hence, the cooperative has stepped up its procurement.

Sources in the cooperative said that earlier CAMPCO lifted produce from the doorsteps of farmers if the quantity of the produce was huge.

Its focus was only on purchasing bulk quantity; for example, if the produce was more than 10 bags.

He said that now the cooperative is yet to fix the minimum quantity if the produce was to be lifted from the doorsteps of farmers. Since it has increased the quantity of purchase only on an experimental basis, nothing has been finalised, he said.

General secretary, All India Areca Growers Association, Puttur, Mahesh Puchchappady, said that if the quantity is very less, initially, CAMPCO can purchase the produce from the doorsteps and make the payment to farmers on the spot and keep the produce in houses itself after sealing the bags. It can transport the produce fro- m an area at one go, may be, once or twice a week. It could save transportation cost, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/338i9d/article32848830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MNARECANUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/campco-ltd-steps-up-arecanut-procurement/article32848831.ece

The bank’s Board of Directors approved the financial results for the quarter and the half-year at a video conference meeting held in Mangaluru.

The operating profit of the bank during the first half year increased from ₹ 763.44 crore to ₹ 1,177.38 crore, a growth of 54.22 %. The Net Interest Income increased by 11.75 % on year-on-year basis to ₹ 1,109.99 crore from ₹ 993.31 crore.

335,2020/10/14,Allow trading in bonds from stressed businesses: CEA Krishnamurthy Subramanian,"Vital for price discovery, says CEA

Regulators must consider permitting the trading of bonds issued by distressed businesses in the corporate bond market, mooted Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Krishnamurthy Subramanian, adding that with the COVID-19 pandemic set to ‘inevitably’ add to the distress in corporates’ and lenders’ balance-sheets, the country needed a price discovery mechanism for stressed assets.

Asserting that the country’s evolving insolvency and bankruptcy process still had scope to become more efficient, he said, “We also need a market for price discovery of stressed assets, without which the process of taking a haircut becomes difficult”.

“Similarly, a corporate bond market that enables bonds of distressed companies to be traded becomes important.

“In India, it’s primarily just the [firms with] top few ratings that get traded. The U.S. benefits a lot in the creative destruction process by having that market for price discovery. So, we need to look at our incentives and the market for price discovery,” Mr. Subramanian added.

‘Incentive problem’

Investigations against bankers for judgments they may exercise to resolve stressed loan accounts also cramped their ability to take ‘economically efficient’ decisions, he opined. Flagging an ‘incentive’ problem affecting public sector bankers in particular, he said that judgment is involved when a company goes into distress and its debt needs to be restructured or written down to turn it around or attract other investors.

“A significant amount of judgment is used to price the value of that debt with a necessary haircut [and] take that hit in the profit and loss account... This is where because of the involvement of judgment, there is always this possibility of a hindsight bias that can create enormous risk aversion,” Mr. Subramanian said. “If a decision made after exercising judgment, can be viewed with a malafide intent, that can make bankers very skittish in making those judgments,” he added.

“Investigations that do not take into account some of these very important nuances, really make it very difficult for bankers to do what is economically efficient,” the CEA said, stressing that such judgment was critical for alleviating the distressed assets problem.

Business barons also needed to snap out of a ‘Heads I win, tails you lose’ approach, Mr. Subramanian contended at a session on stressed assets hosted by industry body FICCI.

“Corporate India needs to recognise and respect that the equity contract entails — if things go well, even if due to luck, you retain control; but if things go bad, possibly also due to luck or exogenous circumstances, ceding control is part of the equity contract,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/figifp/article32856790.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15BUKRISHNAMURTHYVSUBRAMANIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/allow-trading-in-bonds-from-stressed-businesses/article32856791.ece
336,2020/10/14,Only standard loan accounts as of March 1 can be recast under pandemic scheme: RBI,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has clarified that loans which have remained standard without any defaults as of March 1, 2020, will be eligible for restructuring under the pandemic-related resolution framework issued in August.

In clarifications issued late last night to borrowers as well as lenders about the August 6 circular, RBI said a loan account that was due for more than 30 days as on March 1, 2020, but subsequently got regularised, will not be ineligible for resolution under the COVID-19 resolution framework.

This is because the restructuring framework is applicable only for eligible borrowers who were classified as standard as of March 1, 2020.

However, such accounts may still be resolved under the prudential framework dated June 7, 2019, the central bank said.

Similarly, the regulator said restructuring of under-implementation project loans involving deferment of date of commencement of operations (DCCO) are excluded from the scope of resolution framework and that such accounts will continue to be governed by the February 7, 2020, and the other relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions.

Also, in case of multiple lenders to a single borrower whose resolution is undertaken, all lending institutions will have to enter into an inter-creditor agreement.

On whether loans of ₹100 crore and above will require an independent credit evaluation by any one credit rating agency, the apex bank said, in case credit opinion is obtained from more than one rating agency, all such credit opinions must be RP4 rating or above.

The clarification also said the new definition of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) effective June 26, will not impact their eligibility for resolution but will be based on the definition that existed as of March 1, 2020.

It also clarified that any company from any sector is eligible for resolution subject, except those exclusions prescribed in paragraph 2 of the annex to the August 6 circular and also those sector-specific thresholds not specified in the circular dated September 7. But lenders shall make their own internal assessments regarding eligibility.

Loans against property will also be eligible for recast if they don’t fall under the personal loan category.

The quantum of the loan eligible for recast depends on the outstanding as on the date of invocation, which is March 1, 2020, provided it was a standard account then.

It has also been clarified that all farm credit exposures, including non-banking financial institution (NBFCs), can be recast under this scheme, but loans to allied activities such as dairy, fisheries, animal husbandry, poultry, bee-keeping and sericulture are excluded from the scope of the resolution framework.

But loans given to farmer households are eligible for resolution if they are not under other exclusion conditions listed in the framework.

On the loans to the realty sector, RBI said the requirement of inter-creditor agreement is a basic feature of the prudential framework for resolution issued on June 7, 2019, and consequently that of the pandemic resolution framework as well.

However, RBI said there is sufficient flexibility to the lenders to formulate such pacts in respect of a legal entity to which they have exposure that address the specific requirements of each borrowers on a case-to-case basis, including designing different resolution approaches for different projects under the same borrower within an pact.

For borrowers not eligible for resolution under the circular dated August 6, 2020, all the extant instructions shall still be in force. However, if any entity is otherwise eligible to be resolved under the new resolution framework, only this framework can be used for resolving the stress arising out of the pandemic.

338,2020/10/14,"Infosys’s net jumps 21%, guidance raised","Company expects annual revenue to climb 2-3%; to award promotions, increments, incentives in Jan.

Infosys on Wednesday reported second-quarter net profit jumped 20.5% from a year earlier to ₹4,845 crore, helped by better margins. The information technology services provider also raised revenue growth estimates to 2-3% for the full year.

Consolidated revenue from operations rose 8.6% to ₹24,570 crore in the three months ended September.

‘Deal momentum rises’

The deal momentum picked in the quarter, Infosys told the media. The period saw large deals totalling $3.15 billion. Digital revenues grew 25.4%, accounting for 47% of the total business.

A cut in discretionary spending, reduction in travel expenses and savings from ‘work from home’ helped lift the operating margin by 370 basis points to 25.4%.

“We had a substantial Q2 across multiple dimensions: client impact, digital scaling, growth and operating margins,” said Salil Parekh, CEO and MD.

Buoyed by the strong order book, Infosys revised its revenue growth guidance upwards to 2-3% in constant currency for fiscal 2020-21, from 0-2% last quarter.

Raises margin forecast

The operating margin guidance too was revised upwards for the year, to 23-24%, against 21-23% earlier.

High-tech, life sciences and financial services grew strongly from a year earlier and on a sequential basis; banking and finance recorded positive growth. But retail and manufacturing will take time to come back, said COO, Pravin Rao.

An increase in free cash flows in the first half was driven by a “focus on liquidity and cash management”, said CFO Nilanjan Roy. Consequently, Infosys decided to raise the interim dividend per share by 50% to ₹12. Heartened by the results, Infosys said it would give out 100% variable pay, wage increments as well as one-time special incentives to employees effective January.

“The quantum of hikes will be identical to the previous years,” added Mr. Rao.

He said attrition fell “dramatically this quarter and we put tremendous focus on employee engagement. However, once growth comes back fully, we may not be able to sustain this level of attrition”.

The quarter saw voluntary attrition in IT services declining to 7.8%, from 18.3% in the year-earlier period.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/swxju7/article32856746.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15BUINFOSYS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/infosyss-net-jumps-21-guidance-raised/article32856751.ece
339,2020/10/14,Autos to log double-digit volume decline: ICRA,"‘Good recovery expected only in FY22’

The Indian automobile sector is expected to log double-digit decline in volumes in the current year across all vehicle segments, except tractors, with good recovery expected only in FY22, as per rating agency ICRA.

“The volumes in the automotive industry have been pushed back by almost over 10 years,” said ICRA.

“The FY21 volumes are expected to be down for light commercial vehicles (LCVs) by 17-20%, medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs) by 35-40%, passenger vehicles (PVs) by 22-25% and two-wheelers by 16-18%. The auto component industry (including tyres), whose prospects are tied to the automotive sector, is estimated to contract by 14% to 18% in FY21.”

For PV segment it said since the fortunes are tied with GDP growth rates and overall consumer sentiments, which are currently at historic lows, it is expected to witness “strong double-digit growth (>15%)” only in FY2022 after decline of 17.9% in FY2020 and 22%-25% in FY2021.

“The GDP is expected to decline by 11% in FY2021; this will trickle down into lower demand for the automotive industry in general (except tractors),” it said.

The fall in demand, it added, is also reflected in capacity utilisation which is likely to dip below 45% in FY2021, from 50-55% in FY2020. “We expect capex cut by 35-40% during FY2021-FY2022, and incremental investments will be primarily towards new product development and platform improvisation.”

“The rural market will be the key driver of volume in FY21 which will benefit entry level cars and UV. Buyers may opt for 2W or used cars to avoid public transport...The luxury car segment will witness a decline of over 40% in the current financial year,” said Ashish Modani, V-P,, ICRA.

On the Commercial Vehicle (CV) segment, ICRA said while retail sales are reviving, it remains a far cry from pre-Covid levels. As against a monthly sales of over 80,000 units reported prior to the pandemic, CV retail sales trended at less than 40,000 units in September 2020, even after four months of sequential improvement.

“As for the outlook, the M&HCVs and Buses segment...will grow by 40-45% in FY2022, while LCVs will... grow by 15-20%...Given current liquidity constraints and bleak demand, OEMs are curtailing capex spends; from Rs 67 bn in FY2020, it is expected to fall significantly to Rs 24 bn in FY2021 and 21% in FY2022.

As far as tractors are concerned, ICRA revised the earlier growth forecast of 2-4% to 7-9% in FY2021. It said that while uncertainty continues to exist in relation to pandemic, farm sentiments are expected to remain healthy aided by government focus on procurement, healthy monsoon precipitation and a resulting favourable kharif crop outlook.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/aanfgh/article32856692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15BUAUTOSALES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/autos-to-log-double-digit-volume-decline-icra/article32856693.ece

342,2020/10/14,"‘Pandemic shutters 15% of start-ups, funding dips 50%’","But pace of recovery faster than expected, report reveals

Severely impacted by the pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdowns, about 15% of start-ups in India had to discontinue their operations since March, according to a report. Their overall funding dipped by about 50% during the lockdown as compared to pre-COVID levels, the report released on Wednesday said.

Overall, while 40% of start-ups have been negatively impacted, 44% have cash runway for less than six months and 52% of start-ups are struggling to raise another round of funding, the report ‘COVID-19 and the Antifragility of Indian Startup Ecosystem’ released by TiE Delhi-NCR in partnership with Zinnov, said.

The report noted that India exited 2019 as the third largest start-up ecosystem in the world with more than 38,000 active start-ups and receiving $14.5 billion in funding. In the second quarter of 2020 (April-June), the total funding declined 48% to $1.3 billion as against $2.5 billion in the same quarter last year. During the first quarter of the year, funding stood at $2.8 billion.

However, the report added that as the economy opened, the pace of recovery in terms of demand and investor sentiment has been faster than expected.

343,2020/10/14,Code of standards need of the hour to develop hydrogen economy in India,"This will facilitate the development of ‘green’ hydrogen without the use of fossil fuel for a clean fuel economy

To facilitate the development of “green” hydrogen or the production of the gas without the use of fossil fuel to help power vehicles or a clean fuel economy, India needs to develop a consistent code of standards, says a report commissioned by the Department of Science and Technology to investigate the current state of “Hydrogen and Fuel Cells” in India.

“The biggest challenge to the commercialisation of hydrogen based technologies is the requirement of code and standards to get a sort of consistency and encourage deployment. With such standards in place, the process of deployment will drastically increase and technologies which are at laboratory demonstration level could come to marketplace faster,” says the report made public on Wednesday.

The use of hydrogen as a fuel to power vehicles has been a long standing global mission. Hydrogen, or H2 fuel cells leave only water vapour and heat as emissions, and provide as much combustive energy as fossil fuels. However, a key challenge has been portability and transporting the gas.

Several of the Indian Institutes of Technology and laboratories of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research are involved in hydrogen fuel cell research. “It has increased from 10 institutions in the early 1990s to more than 100 today,” the report notes.

Several demonstration projects have been underway for over a decade. The first demonstration project was a hydrogen dispensing station by the Indian Oil Corporation at their R&D centre in Faridabad, Haryana, which was commissioned during 2008-09. The hydrogen produced was being blended with compressed natural gas for use in demonstration and test vehicles.

Another demonstration project was being implemented by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) in association with five automobile manufacturers (Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Eicher Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, and Bajaj Auto) and Indian Oil Corporation, and was towards demonstrating the use of hydrogen blended with CNG (compressed natural gas) in automobiles.

Three buses, two cars and two three-wheelers were part of the project and were used for field trials based on 18% hydrogen (by volume) blended with CNG. The project involves modifications in engine and fuel injection system.

The NITI Aayog has also recommended the use of H-CNG by utilising existing piped-gas infrastructure in Delhi. However, rather than power cars or bikes, India would for now would be better served by developing hydrogen fuel cells for commercial vehicles, say the authors of the report.

“Long-haul vehicles require higher quantity of storage as these are driven over long distances and continuously for long times and these should be refuelled quickly. Hydrogen powered vehicles have similar range as the current fossil fuel-based vehicles, can be refuelled fast, have efficient fleet optimisation and have much higher energy density. The another set of application is in materials handling e.g. forklifts where the time available for refuelling for a unit is very short and the space available for refuelling infrastructure in warehouses is small i.e. they can’t afford long charging hours,” the report added.

The current global demand of hydrogen is 70 million tons per year, most of which is being produced from fossil fuels — 76% from natural gas and around 23% from coal, with the remaining from electrolysis of water — which consumes 6% of the global natural gas and 2% of the global coal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/code-of-standards-need-of-the-hour-to-develop-hydrogen-economy-in-india/article32854934.ece

Market participants are still under the notion that a new US stimulus is coming, but the delay is hinting that it may be rolled out after the US election, said Rahul Gupta, Head of Research- Currency, Emkay Global Financial Services.

Also, the halt in COVID-19 vaccine trials calibrates that the race for a vaccine is bumpy and we cannot hope for a quick global economic recovery,” he added.

Gupta further said that “the USD-INR spot is trading sideways in between 73-73.60 and we may see it to continue being in this range.”

Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.02 per cent to 93.50.

352,2020/10/14,How to reconcile the left with the right? Try Cryptics,"Mihir Balantrapu |

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

Setters aren’t political. But politics as we know and experience it is all wrong. And we all fall for it helplessly, if you ask me.

See, it wants us to like or choose one side over the other. Even though human beings are complex individuals with a lot more grey than black or white.

And the two competing worldviews will only destroy our actual real world with perpetual conflict.

Unless we are able to reconcile the differences between the two, and forge a new way based on an amalgamated worldview that picks an optimal solution from the best of both worlds. And that involves understanding each side clearly for how it is trying to deceive us or benefit us.

Good news, solving cryptic crosswords gives you practice to do just that. Get smarter. Understand the world more clearly. Find the answer in cooperation rather than conflict.

Here’s a nice clue that points out the importance of reconciliation over a win-lose.

The Hindu Cryptic #13066 | Dr. X | 7 Down CLUE: Former British PM ignores leading diplomat, one from a Middle Eastern country (7) Clue types : Deletion, abbreviation Definition : one from a Middle Eastern country Answer : ISRAELI Clue explained: We need a 7-letter word here. As per the rules/conventions of cryptic crosswords, the definition of that word is either the first word/phrase or the final word/phrase. Meaning that the answer appears to be on either side of the clue. Let’s presume that it’s the final word/phrase and see where it takes us. It’s as good a guess as any. And that means the wordplay we’re looking to solve belongs to the left side of the clue. Now, the left side should be matched with or reconciled with the right side. That’s what every cryptic clue is trying to get you to do. (Is that true equality? Well, the setter isn’t political, so let’s see.) So, a ‘former British PM’ could be any of the multitudes of statesmen who have taken up the post in the past. But look at the right side (where the definition presumably lies), and you may just get a cue... The definition, ‘one from a middle-eastern country’, could be an Israeli, possibly. So, does that make you think of Benjamin Disraeli, the former Conservative British Prime Minister who made Queen Victoria Empress of India in the 19th Century? Ah, so that should help us work out the wordplay from the definition, which is sort of like working out the method from the answer. Well, presuming that Disraeli is indeed the British PM that the setter is referring to, let’s see if the rest of the wordplay properly bridges the left and the right. If DISRAELI (‘former British PM’) ‘ignores leading diplomat’, we might just remove (as in, ‘ignore’) the D (‘leading diplomat’ is pointing to a D, the leading letter of ‘diplomat’) and get ourselves an ISRAELI!

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

What you see is rarely ever what you get in a cryptic crossword. But that’s true only for as long as you haven’t fully trained your eye to detect and distinguish the cryptic from the surface at a glance. Once you can become good at doing that, you are like Neo. Now you can see both what’s in front of you as well as what it really looks like in green binary code!

The Hindu Cryptic #13065 | Dr. X| 19 Down CLUE: Possible tear in part of the eye (6) Clue types : anagram Definition : part of the eye Answer : RETINA Clue explained: What is a 6-letter word that could mean ‘part of the eye’? Cornea? Retina? Humour? Well, now that you have identified a likely definition, as well as potential solution options, it’s time to check out the wordplay... So, if you are right about ‘part of the eye’ being the definition, then that leaves ‘Possible tear in’ as the wordplay words that should construct one of your potential solution options. So, since the word ‘possible’ is a very likely anagram indicator, the phrase ‘possible tear in’ might just mean that the setter needs us to anagram the letters of ‘tear in’. Which, if you do, you will end up with a word that looks like ERATIN, or ATRINE, or NATIRE — none of which are actual words! But wait, there’s one much more obvious word that is formed when you anagram ‘tear in’. And that’s RETINA, which is one of our potential options for a 6-letter word that means ‘part of the eye’!

354,2020/10/14,A concerted attack on RTI,"The worst blow to the right to information regime has come in the form of a persistent attack on the transparency watchdogs

This year marks 15 years of the enactment of the Right to Information (RTI) law, which has empowered millions to assert their citizenship and show truth to power. It was a vibrant grassroots movement, led not just by the educated elite but the working poor across the country, that eventually resulted in the passage of the historic law in 2005.

The right to information has been upheld by the Supreme Court as a fundamental right flowing from Article 19 of the Constitution, which guarantees every citizen the right to free speech and expression. Without access to relevant information, people’s ability to formulate opinions and express themselves meaningfully is curtailed. Since its enactment, the RTI law has been used by people to seek information to actively participate in decision-making processes and hold governments accountable.

Also read | At 15, RTI Act crippled by rising backlog

The potential of the law

Every year nearly six million applications are filed under the RTI Act, making it the most extensively used transparency legislation in the world. National assessments have shown that a large proportion of these are filed by the poorest and the most marginalised who have understood the tremendous potential of the law to empower them to access their basic rights and entitlements, especially in the absence of effective grievance redress mechanisms to address service delivery failures. During the COVID-19 crisis too, the law has been widely used to seek information about availability of medical facilities, like ventilators and ICU beds, and to hold government departments accountable for delivery of foodgrains and social security benefits meant for those in distress, including migrant workers.

The RTI Act has also been put to effective use by public-spirited citizens to shine the light on corruption and arbitrary abuse of power by the state. People have used it to question the highest offices. Information has been accessed about the anonymous electoral bonds though which thousands of crores have been channelled into political parties. The Prime Minister’s Office has been queried about the expenditure of the PM CARES Fund set up to provide relief during disasters like the current pandemic.

By giving every citizen of India the right to access government files and records, the law has potentially created 1.3 billion whistleblowers and auditors. It has empowered citizens to question those who govern and hold them to account. Consistent attempts by governments to denigrate the law bear testimony to this tilting of the balance of power.

Comment | The tremor of unwelcome amendments to the RTI Act

Attack on the transparency watchdogs

The worst blow to the RTI regime has come in the form of a persistent and concerted attack on the transparency watchdogs set up under the law. Information Commissions at the Centre and in the States are the final adjudicators empowered to act against violations of the legislation. In 2019, regressive amendments were made to the RTI Act which did away with statutory protection of fixed tenure and high status conferred on the commissioners. Despite stiff opposition within and outside Parliament, the government pushed the RTI (Amendment) Act which allows the Central government to determine the tenure and salaries of all Information Commissioners, signalling that directions to disclose inconvenient information could invite adverse consequences.

The functioning of commissions has been severely impeded by governments not appointing Information Commissioners in a timely manner. Vacancies in Information Commissions lead to large backlogs of appeals/complaints and long delays in the disposal of cases, effectively frustrating the people’s right to know. The track record of the BJP-led government at the Centre has been particularly abysmal. Since May 2014, not a single commissioner of the Central Information Commission (CIC) has been appointed without citizens having to approach courts. Despite Supreme Court orders to fill all vacancies, six out of 11 posts of commissioners are currently vacant in the CIC, including that of the chief. The CIC is headless for the fifth time in the last six years! State governments appear to have adopted a similar strategy. Eight State Information Commissions are functioning without a chief. Two commissions — Tripura and Jharkhand — are totally defunct with no commissioners.

The right to question is the hallmark of a democracy. Any attack on the RTI law, which has empowered citizens to question those in power, is an attack on the foundation of our democratic republic. It is a clear reflection of the lack of political will of governments to be answerable to the people of the country.

As the RTI law completes 15 years, it is again time for those whom it empowers — the citizens — to assert themselves and protect their fundamental right to information, which they attained after a long struggle.

355,2020/10/14,Quadrilateral home truths,"The Quad would do well to heed four lessons drawn from Asia’s history and geopolitics

Regardless of how or when China’s misbegotten military adventure is going to wind down in Ladakh, one thing is clear: it has breathed fresh life into the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue as a loose, consultative entente of like-minded democracies in the Indo-Pacific. On October 6, the foreign ministers of Australia, India, Japan and the U.S. held a standalone meeting in Tokyo. If the Quad is to prosper as a geopolitical construct, it would do well to heed four lessons drawn from the long arc of Asia’s history and geopolitics.

No Indo-Pacific system

First, there is no such thing as an ‘Indo-Pacific system’. There has never been one, as such, ever since the rise of the port-based kingdoms of Indochina in the first half of the second millennium. Rather, there were two Asian systems — an Indian Ocean system and an East Asian system — with intricate sub-regional balances. The sprawling British empire never managed to combine the Indo and the Pacific into a unitary system and the effort by a U.S. in global retreat and relative decline to artificially manufacture one to encircle China will be no more successful.

Also read | China’s Foreign Minister says U.S. using Quad to build ‘Indo-Pacific NATO’

Second, the Indo-Pacific region possesses no prior experience of enduring peace, prosperity and stability engineered from its maritime fringes. Rather, dynamic long cycles of Chinese influence radiating outwards have alternated with sharp periods of centripetal turmoil as China and the Asian system collapsed upon itself.

The emerging practice of ASEAN-centred multilateralism is more in tune with regional tradition and historical circumstance than the post-18th century European ‘balance of power’ system, where the ‘flanking powers’ (Britain and Russia) resisted revisionist challengers to periodically restore the continent’s equilibrium. For their part, the Indo-Pacific’s ‘flanking powers’, India and Japan, have never balanced Chinese power throughout their illustrious histories.

Third, the sea lines of communication constitute the connective tissue that links the Indian Ocean to the Western Pacific. It is also a valuable arena of leverage vis-à-vis Chinese shipping and resource flows. This leverage must be wielded judiciously on India’s terms, not on the Quad’s terms. The latter, after all, has little to offer materially with regard to New Delhi’s continental two-front dilemma but ceding this chokepoint leverage will invite overwhelming Chinese pressure against the full range of India’s South Asian interests — to which the other Quad members possess neither will nor desire to answer. For the threat of interdiction to be credible furthermore, it must not be brandished off-handedly. Except during a general war, no sustained and significant campaign to interdict the maritime trade of a major power has ever been successfully mounted since the Napoleonic Wars of the 19th century.

Editorial | Four for one: On Quad, India and the U.S.

A check on China’s ambitions

Finally, the Quad has a valuable role to play as a check on China’s Indian Ocean ambitions. India must develop ingrained habits of interoperable cooperation with its Quad partners and, thereby, pre-emptively dissuade China from mounting a naval challenge in its backyard. On the other hand, it will be more than a decade or two before the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be credibly capable of projecting power in these waters.

The shores of the Indo-Pacific littoral are strewn with the bones of Cold War-vintage, pan-regional architectures that were divorced from the underlying security dynamics. The Quad must resist this temptation for precipitate design over purpose.

In 2018, in his keynote address at the Shangri La Dialogue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted that India would “work with [its friends] individually or in formats of three or more for a stable and peaceful region, but [that these] friendships are not alliances of containment”. Reconciling this capacity to resist armed revisionism while nudging the region’s geopolitics towards cooperation as opposed to conflict should be India’s, and the Quad’s, priority.

356,2020/10/14,Ferment in the heartland,"Caste rivalries are causing fissures in BJP’s Hindu unity plank in U.P., opening an opportunity for Rahul Gandhi

In 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 62 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, and in 2014, 71. U.P. elects 15% of the Lok Sabha members, but it contributed 20% of the BJP members in 2019 and 25% in 2014. The concentrated support in regions above the Vindhyas, the Hindutva heartland, enabled the BJP to win 56% of the Lok Sabha seats with 38% votes in 2019. In U.P., the Congress won two seats in 2014 and one in 2019. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi lost his own heartland seat of Amethi in 2019; to enter the Lok Sabha, he chose a seat in the geographical and social periphery of Hindu nationalism — the minority-majority Wayanad seat in Kerala.

Mr. Gandhi has now sought to bring the battle back to the heartland, in Hathras in U.P., by rallying public opinion against caste violence, and in Punjab and Haryana, by spearheading farmer protests. He managed to put the spotlight on oppressive caste violence often invisibilised by slogans of Hindu unity as well as on the political self-quarantine of two champions of social justice, former Chief Ministers Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati. Further turns in U.P. will depend on whether Mr. Gandhi remains consistent and whether the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) intervenes to enforce order in its tent. Threatening the BJP’s pre-eminence in U.P. is not so much the upper caste violence against Dalits as the intensifying rivalry between two upper caste groups that form the social core of Hindutva in its geographical core — the Thakurs and the Brahmins.

The Yogi model

Affinity, privilege and dispossession linked to caste are not uncommon anywhere, but in U.P. politics, they are all uniquely intense. Caste has been a major obstacle to Hindu unity. Rejection, at least in theory, of untouchability, remained a common thread across all attempts of Hindu unification in history, but the question of inequality was rarely confronted. In the 1980s, when the Sangh Parivar ramped up its efforts to reach out to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Dalits, it consciously chose the word samrasta (harmony) over the word samata (equality). Harmony does not reject or preclude hierarchy.

Narendra Modi’s rise marked Hindutva 2.0 — political Hinduism contoured to demands of the market and Mandal aspirations — which created a national Hindu majority, concentrated in the heartland. The Vishva Hindu Parishad captured the ongoing process in a statement following the acquittal of Parivar leaders in the Babri Masjid demolition case thus: “We call upon the society to now look forward to the urgent tasks at hand, the completion of a Grand Temple at Shri Ramjanmabhoomi, the eradication of social inequalities and establishment of samrasta, to bring about social, educational and economic upliftment of the Scheduled Castes, Tribes and other economically backward sections of the society as also to build a strong and stable Bharat; capable of fighting the attacks and challenges from within and at the borders” (emphasis added).

The BJP has been far more open and successful in accommodating marginalised castes than the Congress in the heartland. The Parivar also overlooked, sidelined, or confronted autonomous intermediary and Dalit groups, as has been the case with the Marathas in Maharashtra, the Patels in Gujarat, the Yadavs in Bihar, and the Yadavs and Jatavs in U.P. It chose upper caste leaders only in non-threatening environs for the rest — a Thakur in Chhattisgarh or a Brahmin in Maharashtra. The appointment of Yogi Adityanath as Chief Minister of U.P. in 2017 marked a change in this pattern. It also coincided with an upper caste impatience to reclaim their marginal losses during the Mandal surge. Mr. Adityanath’s strident commitment to Hindutva was a factor that endeared him to the Parivar. If his Thakur background was deliberately overlooked, it may have been motivated by a belief — which now stands challenged — that being a priest in saffron, his identity was solely Hindu.

Comment | Dalit politics at a crossroads

The Parivar’s preferred instrument for Hindu unity is hegemony as opposed to domination. Domination is used occasionally, for instance, against Ambedkarites. The disproportionate association of negative attributes such as inefficiency, corruption, nepotism and policy paralysis with OBCs, Dalit and minority leaders in public debates is not accidental but often an outcome of curated hegemonic discourses. The 2007 slogan that heralded the Jatav-Brahmin social coalition that catapulted Ms. Mayawati to power in U.P. creatively linked the emergence of any fresh political narrative to caste hierarchy — ‘Brahmin Shankh Bajayaenge Tho Haathi Badta Jaayega (If the Brahmin keeps blowing the conch, the elephant will keep moving forward)’. The Brahmins, estimated to be above 10% of the U.P. voters, are the most impactful swing voters anywhere in India at the moment. In 2007, their support brought Ms. Mayawati to power; in 2012, they moved en masse to Akhilesh Yadav who became the Chief Minister; and in 2017, they moved en masse to the BJP that won.

Though Brahmins remain loyal to the BJP generally speaking, they feel sidelined and threatened in U.P. The social media chatter following the killing of gangster Vikas Dubey in July was instructive of how the community perceives its ties with the Yogi administration. If the Thakur-Brahmin rivalry is settled amicably by the RSS leadership, the current turmoil in the State could recede and its memory will fade.

Comment | The crisis in Dalit-Bahujan politics

Rahul’s second coming?

Mr. Gandhi is one leader who is beyond caste and even religion. While this could be his biggest advantage in a society reeling from sectarianisms of various types, this could be his biggest disadvantage too. He belongs to a cohort that is ‘truly Indian,’ in the sense Ashis Nandy describes as one who “cannot be easily identified with any specific regional culture in India.” “You cannot fit them into anything local. They can only be called Indians... They are partly deracinated.” These ‘true Indians’ are hence also disconnected from the rural, communitarian milieu. In an overwhelmingly Hinduised political climate, being disconnected from particularities is a double-edged sword. Mr. Gandhi’s grandmother and father had to assert their Hindu identity. He is evidently conflicted over the question — he is unsure of his tilak and rudraksh. The disconnect from the local and the sectarian is also the reason why the Congress remains insular to the aspirations of backward and Dalit politics. To be fair, it has been responsive in policy — the expansion of Mandal to higher education during the United Progressive Alliance regime is instructive. The challenge is in representation. The Congress has no Dalit or OBC leader in the heartland who is identified as such. Mr. Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi forced a rethink among their critics through their tenacious intervention in Hathras, but the exclusion of U.P. Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, himself an OBC, from the scene was inexplicable. What Mr. Gandhi lacks is not courage or conviction, but attention to detail and consistency, which are more important.

The caste rivalries in U.P. at the moment are a strictly regional housekeeping challenge for Hindutva, with no immediate implications for Mr. Modi’s politics. However, their inherent contradictions have resurfaced more violently than any time in at least a decade and this potentially opens a fresh opportunity for Mr. Gandhi in the heartland.

357,2020/10/14,A slim stimulus: On Centre’s move spur demand,"The govt. cannot wait for the pandemic to ease to loosen the purse strings further

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s fresh set of measures, on Monday, to spur consumer demand and capital expenditure include an interestingly designed tweak to the LTC allowances of government employees. Her reckoning is that these would lend a ₹73,000 crore demand spurt to prop up the ailing economy in the second half of this year. This could rise beyond ₹1-lakh crore if private sector employers offered similar LTC incentives. With industrial output slipping for the sixth month in a row in August, the clamour for new stimulus measures had been growing ahead of a particularly bleak festive season. But this package, which will cost the exchequer about 0.2% of GDP, taking overall fiscal support through the pandemic to 1.7% of GDP, may not be as persuasive as may have been envisaged. Enhancing the Centre’s capital expenditure in specific sectors by ₹25,000 crore from the extant level of ₹4.12-lakh crore is laudable. But pandemic restrictions have affected the ability to get new projects going. Till August, just about ₹1.34-lakh crore of the budgeted capex had been spent. The same problem plagues the ₹12,000 crore offered as an interest-free 50-year loan to States for capital spending over the next six months.

While States have been allowed to use these loans to pay off existing contractors’ dues, the amounts on offer are unlikely to have an impact; ₹2,000 crore has been set aside for States that manage to complete three of four reforms mandated in the earlier Atmanirbhar Bharat package, in order to get additional borrowing leeway. Only some States may qualify for this. Too many conditions also pervade the consumption push. Linking LTC perks of government staff who have not availed them yet due to restricted travel during the pandemic to spending on non-travel items is an innovative nudge. But requiring them to spend three times their return ticket fares under LTC on goods and services attracting at least 12% GST from GST-registered vendors, may be too prescriptive and overlooks the reluctance towards discretionary spending due to low visibility on the economy’s prospects. Eligible employees may find the scheme complex and too expensive to avail. One hopes the government has more in its quiver to expedite recovery. Waiting too long for the pandemic to ease before loosening the purse strings further could extend the pain. The focus should not just be on conjuring a trickle-down stimulus from those with their jobs and savings intact but also on relief measures for those without. Even the IMF has been urging countries to spend now to diminish the damage. Avoiding spending now to maintain fiscal discipline and prevent a rating downgrade seems sensible, but if the underlying edifices of the country’s growth story crumble in the process, a future downgrade will become inevitable.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-slim-stimulus-the-hindu-editorial-on-centres-fresh-move-spur-demand/article32847452.ece
358,2020/10/14,"Crisis in Caucasus: On Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh","Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Karabakh rebels should go back to the ceasefire

The ongoing fighting between Armenian rebels and the Azerbaijani Army in Nagorno-Karabakh, a self-declared republic within Azerbaijan, risks becoming a wider regional conflict. Though Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to a Russia-mediated ceasefire last week after days of fighting, the truce crumbled immediately amid a blame game. Whatever the truth is, an emboldened Azerbaijan, backed by Turkey, seems determined to press ahead with its offensive. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is decades old. The region, largely populated by ethnic Armenians, is located within the international boundaries of Azerbaijan. Under the Soviet Union, it was an autonomous province that was part of the Azerbaijan republic. In 1988, when the Soviet power was receding, the regional assembly in Nagorno-Karabakh voted to join Armenia, triggering ethnic clashes. After the Soviet disintegration in 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan went to war over this largely mountainous, forested enclave. By the time a ceasefire was reached in 1994, the rebels, with support from Armenia and Russia, had established their de facto rule and extended their influence to the Armenian border. Ever since, the border has remained tense.

What makes the clashes now far more dangerous is the external intervention. Turkey has called Armenia a threat to peace in the region; the Azeris and Turks share ethnic and linguistic bonds. Also, the pre-Soviet Azerbaijan was a local ally of the Ottomans when they invaded Transcaucasia in the last leg of World War I. For Turkey, which, under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is trying to expand its geopolitical reach to the former Ottoman regions, the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is an opportunity to enter the South Caucasus. Turkey also has a particularly bad relationship with Armenia. But its problem is that Armenia is a member of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Russia enjoys good economic and defence ties with both Armenia and Azerbaijan. But Armenia, as a CSTO member and host to a Russian military base, has more weight. In a wider conflict, Armenia could trigger Article 4 of the CSTO treaty and ask for Russian help. And if Moscow responds favourably, that would pit Russia against Turkey, a NATO member. Russia, already involved in military conflicts in Syria, Ukraine and Libya, may not like opening another front. That is why it has re-emphasised its neutrality and hosted talks in Moscow for a truce. But it will be forced to take sides if the conflict spills into Armenia. Both sides should understand the volatile situation and call off the hostilities. Nagorno-Karabakh has in the past witnessed large-scale ethnic violence. Instead of risking a regional war, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Karabakh rebels should go back to the ceasefire and open up diplomatic channels.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crisis-in-caucasus-the-hindu-editorial-on-armenia-azerbaijan-and-nagorno-karabakh/article32847463.ece
359,2020/10/14,Guidelines issued for festival season,"Only licensed shops will be allowed to sell firecrackers

For combating COVID-19 in the festival season, the government on Wednesday came out with a set of guidelines to limit the number of people to 100 for any Dasara festivities in the State.

The guidelines issued by Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar also put guidelines for Deepavali celebrations. It said that only licensed shops would be allowed to sell firecrackers from November 1 to 17 at prescribed places. Shops should be set up by maintaining distance of six metres to ensure free flow of air, it said.

The State government, on Wednesday, issued a notification on increasing the number of wards under the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to 243. Until now, there were 198 wards in the city.

361,2020/10/14,BMTC to harness solar power,"Aims to repair finances hit by lack of operations and lower passenger count due to COVID-19

Reeling under losses from lockdown-induced lack of operations and lower passenger count due to COVID-19, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is looking to improve its finances from other sources. The transport corporation is likely to run some of its offices by harnessing solar power, which is expected to save a substantial amount of money on its electricity bills.

Arun K., Director, Security and Vigilance, BMTC, told The Hindu that conservative estimates were of the transport corporation saving around ₹20 crore a year. “Technical evaluation is under way for the feasibility of the project. We want it to be viable for both us as well as the agency installing solar infrastructure. In this case, while we will save on power bills, the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) will be able to generate additional power,” he said.

Saptak Ghosh, Research Scientist, CSTEP, which is conducting the feasibility study, said they are assessing the feasibility of 75 major bus stations, TTMCs, workshops and depots. “Around 3 MW will possibly be installed by Bescom under their 13th finance commission project on 10 buildings. For the remaining 65 buildings, third-party developers will lease the roof from BMTC and sell all the generated electricity to Bescom,” he added.

“In the first case, BMTC gets free electricity while Bescom gets surplus generation for free. In the second case, BMTC gets a certain amount from the third-party as rent for the roof while Bescom gets clean power to fulfil RPO obligations,” he explained, adding that CSTEP is using CREST to prepare DPRs for both the cases.

CREST-CSTEP’s Rooftop Evaluation of Solar Tool was launched virtually recently, enabling consumers to assess their rooftop’s potential to generate solar energy for their own consumption, as well as to supply additional power generated to Bescom.

BMTC Chairman N.S. Nandiesha Reddy said the corporation wants to implement solar power in all its buildings once the technical details are worked out. “We are looking at big numbers in savings as we have all kinds of properties – offices, buildings that house tenants, TTMCs and depots,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/od2ada/article32855990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGDEPOTP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bmtc-to-harness-solar-power/article32855991.ece

The Bellandur police on Tuesday booked a private telecom company and its partner company for allegedly damaging a power cable leading to power disruption in the area early Monday morning.

Based on a complaint filed by Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) Assistant Engineer Lakshmi Narayana Reddy, the police charged the representatives of both companies on Tuesday with causing damage to public property.

The incident came to light when Bescom officials inspected the area following a series of complaints about sudden power disruption.

“We carried out a physical inspection and found that the main supply power cable had been damaged by illegal road digging on a service road,” said Mr. Reddy in his complaint to the police.

Officials took up repair work to restore power supply in the area. The cost of the damaged power line is estimated to be around ₹1 lakh, Mr. Reddy said in his complaint to the police.

364,2020/10/14,D.J. Halli violence: Two MLAs questioned by NIA,"Police had taken the help of B.Z. Zameer Ahmed and Rizwan Arshad to defuse the situation

The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the violence at D.J. Halli and K.J. Halli on August 11, questioned Chamrajpet MLA B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan and Shivaji Nagar MLA Rizwan Arshad on Tuesday.

“This is a part of the procedure. We are questioning witnesses who were present at the spot and tried to help the police contain the situation,” said an NIA official.

On August 11, the night of the violence, the police had called both MLAs to the spot to try and pacify the mob that had gathered to protest a derogatory social media post against Islam by Naveen Kumar, nephew of Pulikeshinagar MLA Akhanda Sreenivasa Murthy.

“We are probing what exactly happened and how the MLAs perceived the situation. Their statements were recorded,” said the NIA official.

Mr. Arshad said that they went to the spot that night to help the police defuse the situation. “We did what best we could to contain the situation. It was a big risk for us, but we saw it as our responsibility to ensure peace,” he said.

The investigation agency is also questioning senior police officials who were at the spot as well as prime suspect former mayor Sampath Raj and former Pulakeshinagar councillor Abdul Rakhib Zakir, both of whom have been named in the chargesheet filed by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) police. They have been accused of conspiracy and mobilising the mob to carry out attacks on the house MLA Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy due to alleged political rivalry.

Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Wednesday said that the Congress had no role in the violence and accused the ruling BJP of creating fear among party leaders and inducting them into the saffron party. Congress leaders will not fear the blackmailing tactics of the BJP, he told mediapersons.

Soon after taking over the case, the NIA on September 24 arrested Syed Sadiq Ali, 44, a recovery agent with a private bank for his alleged role as a key conspirator. Officials suspect Sadiq of being in touch with many accused who were a part of the conspiracy to create a law and order problem on a large scale.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/moa3uw/article32855466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGDJP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dj-halli-violence-two-mlas-questioned-by-nia/article32855467.ece

The Karnataka High Court posed this question to the State government during the hearing of a a PIL petition, filed by H.K. Ramchanandra and five others. The petitioners wanted a PHC in their village of Jodihocihalli of Kadur taluk in Chikkamagalur district.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S Kinagi said the policy of the Government villagers requiring to provide two acres of land and deposit ₹1lakh for a PHC appears to be unjust when the citizens right to health care as per the interpretation the apex court’s judgements on the right to protection of life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.

Earlier, Vijayakumar A Patil, a government counsel, in response to Court’s query on whether there exists any policy to establish PHCs, said that the policy framed, in 1987, stated that the residents of a village, having population more than 30,000, were required to deposit ₹lakh and give two acres of land free of encumbrance for constructing a building if they wanted the Government to set up a PHC their village.

366,2020/10/14,Multiplexes ready for show time,"However, single screens adopt wait and watch approach

As the countdown begins for theatres to resume screening films from October 15, many multiplexes are gearing up to welcome customers. However, though the Central and State governments have permitted cinema halls to resume operations with 50% seating, many single screen theatres in the city will not immediately re-open as they have adopted a ‘wait and watch’ approach.

A senior representative of PVR Cinemas said that they would resume screenings for the general public from October 16. “The schedule will be out soon. Online bookings will begin from the night of October 13. All precautionary measures for a safe and hygienic cinema experience for movie-goers are in place,” the representative said.

Sources in INOX said that they would “gradually” open all screens over the next few days, and within 15 days, all the screens would be functional.

Standalone theatres

But not all standalone theatres in the city are ready to resume screening immediately.

D.R. Jairaj, chairman, Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce, said that the Chamber would soon call a meeting of producers, distributors and exhibitors to discuss and decide on resuming operations in single screen theatres.

“While the exhibitors are worried about the content, producers are worried about patronage. Though most of them are enthusiastic about resuming screening, uncertainty over various aspects will delay opening of many theatres,” he said.

A few exhibitors The Hindu spoke to said that they were not ready for resumption of screening in the current circumstances. Apart from the problem of content, they expressed worry over whether people would come to theatres.

Maneka, Mukunda and Radhakrishna are among theatres that will not resume screening films immediately, sources said.

N.S. Srinivasa Murthy, partner in Menaka theatre and former president of FKCCI, said that they have “indefinitely” postponed the opening of Menaka. “On the one hand, the number of COVID-19 cases in the city is on the rise, which might prompt people not to go to theatres. On the other hand, there is 50% cap on the seating capacity. Screening should be a continuous process. We cannot stop after a few days owing to lack of content. Hence, we will wait,” he said.

Veteran producer K.C.N. Chandrashekar hoped that the theatre business would pick up by Deepavali. “The industry will have to gain momentum in the first few weeks. We still do not know how people will respond, and we cannot guess during such unprecedented times. Hence, everyone is adapting a wait and watch approach,” he said.

A manager of a standalone theatre in the city said that fear of additional loss after being shut for around seven months was one of the main reasons to wait.

Santosh is among the standalone theatres that are set resume operations. Arun Kumar B.S., owner of Santosh, said that initially they would screen “running films” that were released in February and March. They had in stock Shivarjuna, starring the the late Chiranjeevi, which was released just before the lockdown was imposed in March.

“We might also go for re-runs of old movies. Once we start, we will get to know how things pan out, which will help us plan for the future. This will give a good picture to producers and distributors. Based on the response, producers can take a decision on releasing new films,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cfkxgd/article32846384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGTHEATREP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/multiplexes-ready-for-show-time/article32846385.ece
367,2020/10/14,Former Mayor among those named in CCB chargesheet in D.J. Halli case,"It states that political rivalry led to violence in which MLA’s house was set on fire

The Central Crime Branch (CCB) police filed an interim 400-page chargesheet recently in connection with the violence in D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli in August, citing that political rivalry between the former Mayor, former councillor and the present MLA R. Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy led to the incident.

The CCB has stated the involvement of R. Sampath Raj, former Mayor from the Congress, and his personal assistant Arun, car driver Santhosh, and former Pulakeshinagar councillor Abdul Rakhib Zakir, among 60 others, alleging that the accused organised the violent mob and provoked them to set fire to the house and office of the MLA.

Sources said both Mr. Sampath Raj and Mr. Zakir, named in the chargesheet, are trying to get anticipatory bail. Mr. Zakir did not turn up for the CCB questioning scheduled on Monday.

Derogatory post

The chargesheet stated that on August 11, the MLA’s nephew Naveen, who is presently in judicial custody, had posted derogatory statements hurting the sentiments of a minority community, after which a couple of youths started gathering at Kavalbyrasandra in front of Naveen’s house and started shouting slogans.

Mr. Sampath Raj and Mr. Zakir had political rivalry with Mr. Murthy and took advantage of the situation, allegedly hatching a plan to carry out the violent protest and attack, sources said. The chargesheet reportedly mentions that the duo had provoked the crowd to go to the MLA’s house and attack him and set fire to the house.

A senior CCB officer said that these are preliminary charges and the role of the former Mayor has been mentioned in the chargesheet, but he would be questioned to record his statement and a chargesheet filed on the outcome of interrogation and investigation findings.

There are 72 FIRs filed in D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli police stations and 421 accused have been arrested, while there are two cases filed on police firing. Even the National Investigation Agency is probing the case.

The CCB is conducting the investigation on the attack on the MLA’s house while the rest of the FIRs have been investigated by east division police.

Protest demanding arrest

Supporters of Mr. Murthy, on Tuesday, staged a protest at Periyar Circle in D.J. Halli demanding that the police arrest Mr. Sampath Raj and Mr. Zakir.

The protesters demanded that despite the police having ample evidence of their involvement, they are yet to arrest them.

Meanwhile, eight accused in the violence case are yet to be released despite getting bail. Ishrathullah, member of the Secular Advocates Front, which is taking up the cases, said that though the eight, who have been granted bail by a sessions court, were supposed to be released on Tuesday, the police have taken them on body warrant in another case. This is to avoid bail for the accused, which would be challenged in the High Court, Mr. Ishrathullah said.

According to him, the CCB has filed 73 FIRs against over 400 people, out of which 300 have been booked under the UAPA provisions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/f4pyrs/article24367675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGMAYORSAMPATHRAJ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/former-mayor-among-those-named-in-ccb-chargesheet-in-dj-halli-case/article32848784.ece
368,2020/10/14,"Madras High Court judge asks Corporation Commissioner, Police chief to walk on Marina Beach","Justice Vineet Kothari was of the view that the beautiful beach could be maintained well if government officials as well as judges of the court frequent the place often

Justice Vineet Kothari of the Madras High Court on Tuesday asked Greater Chennai Commissioner of Police Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal and Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash to take their morning or evening walk on the Marina beach and its loop road, to ensure that the place was maintained well and was free of encroachments.

The senior-most judge of the court was of the view that the beautiful beach could be maintained well if government officials as well as judges of the court frequent the place often. Justice M.S. Ramesh concurred with him and stated that he would also begin taking a stroll on the beach front to take stock of the situation.

During the hearing of a case in which a Division Bench led by him had taken up the task of beautification of the Marina, Justice Kothari wondered why the Marina had not obtained a blue tag given by an international organisation to best beaches in the world. He said all beaches in the State must be maintained to international standards.

His bench also took note of a newspaper report regarding encroachments on the loop road. However, Mr. Prakash, appeared before the court through a video call and explained that all those encroachments by fruit vendors and others had been removed. He said the vendors had encroached on the loop road due to loss of livelihood during the lockdown.

However, now, the Corporation and police officers had asked the local fishermen association to keep a check on encroachments on the loop road, he said. The Commissioner also told the court that a proposal to construct a fish market on two acres of land on the loop road was under active consideration of the government and it would fructify soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/3043ou/article32852898.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14OCTTH--MARINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/madras-high-court-judge-asks-corporation-commissioner-police-chief-to-walk-on-marina-beach/article32852899.ece
369,2020/10/14,Madras HC accords virtual farewell to Justice Ravichandrabaabu,"Judges and lawyers attending the event through videoconference

Justice K. Ravichandrabaabu, who had apologised to a freedom fighter, V. Gandhi, in 2018 for the bureaucratic delay in granting him pension, retired from service on Tuesday on attaining the age of superannuation. The court accorded him a virtual farewell due to COVID-19, with many judges and lawyers attending the event through videoconference.

“I think I have created history by being the first judge of this court to be accorded a virtual farewell. Let me be the first and last judge to have had a virtual farewell and let the difficulties posed by the pandemic vanish soon,” he told the gathering who watched the proceedings webcast live on the YouTube channel of the High Court.

The judge recalled how he had stepped into the High Court buildings for the first time when he was seven-years-old. He had come along with his father who had wanted to meet a lawyer. Stating that he was amazed at the majestic court buildings and the men in robes back then, he said: “I never thought I would someday become the judge of the same court”.

In his address, Advocate General Vijay Narayan described Justice Ravichandrabaabu as an affable judge who always gave a patient hearing to senior lawyers and juniors.

Born at Rishivandiyam in Villupuram district on October 14, 1958, he had pursued higher education at the Madras Christian College and then at the Madras Law College. He was enrolled with the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in 1984 and practised under senior counsel R. Gandhi before being elevated as a judge of the High Court in December 2011.

In 2018, moved by the injustice meted out to a freedom fighter who was denied pension for decades, the judge wrote: “I can only say to the writ petitioner [V. Gandhi], sorry sir, you are made to suffer at the hands of our people too [besides the British] as unfortunately, this is how the bureaucratic dogmatism with a wooden approach works in this country for which you fought to get freedom”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/madras-hc-accords-virtual-farewell-to-justice-ravichandrabaabu/article32852814.ece
370,2020/10/14,Words of reflection: How Lockdown Journal Chennai showcased local writers,"The online platform chronicled the mood of people during these unprecedented times

The lockdown has meant different things to different people; while some have been out of business, others have been adjusting to their new WFH routine. But, it has also ignited a few creative minds in the city. 25-plus Chennai writers have penned their personal experiences during these tough times, and their works have been featured in the online platform Lockdown Journal Chennai.

The Journal is the brainchild of writer Praveena Shivram, who, along with journalist-publisher Vincent D’Souza, hoped to chronicle essays, poems, fiction and non-fiction work based on the lockdown. They drew inspiration from a similar effort in Goa. “The idea was that the writing would be some kind of archival stuff that reflects the mood of people at this point of time,” explains Vincent.

Kickstarted on May 2, the Lockdown Journal Chennai — mostly popularised through word-of-mouth promotion within the writers’ community — has till date clocked 30 entries, all in English. Praveena assures that the entries are very different from newspaper reports and social media posts that revolve around lockdown. “For starters, the pieces are personal and real-time accounts,” she explains, adding “There is a certain urgency in writing, since the writer is living in the reality he/she is describing. That gives the journal its texture. Also, as it is not written in retrospect, the burden of nostalgia is not there.” There is variety in the writing — if storyteller Janaki Sabesh talks about her mother-in-law’s everyday routine in Google Kanmani, writer Aashika Suresh becomes pensive in the Grief in Confined Spaces poem.

Praveena exercises restraint when it comes to choosing pitches and finalising the stories that go on page. “It’s about how well the story has been put together and structured. Sometimes, I have worked with the writer to bring it to a certain level,” adds Praveena. Going back and forth takes time, which is why the platform is updated only when a piece is fully ready to go. In a bid to encourage more local writers, the team is offering a small honorarium for published material.

Praveena believes that the written word is crucial, despite the importance we give to visuals and videos today. “You spend time thinking before writing, and this distilled thought process is important when it comes to something as big as the pandemic. I tell all my writers that they are part of history and have got the opportunity to pen down experiences that might never occur at a later stage.”

Though the lockdown is technically over in the city, the team behind the Journal hopes to keep it up and running. “We are not sure how its tone will change, but we are looking at it as a platform for good writing in Chennai,” signs off Vincent.

The Chennai Corporation has brought down the number of containment zones in the city to 57 from 70, after a gap of three days.

The civic body, which had brought back barricading of streets from October 1 after COVID-19 positive cases started increasing in the city, had initially increased containment zones from 10 to 70. A major portion of the barricaded streets were in Ambattur zone, at 29.

As per the containment zone data released on Wednesday however, there are now only 57 places that are barricaded. The number of streets blocked in Ambattur zone is now 19.

A senior official of the civic body said 13 streets in Chennai, of which 10 streets are in Ambattur zone and were barricaded in the last week of September, have now had barricades removed. As the number of active cases has dropped below the 1,000-mark from a high of 1,062 on October 10, the barricades were taken away.

372,2020/10/14,"Coronavirus | E-registration will replace e-pass, T.N. govt. tells court","Passes will still be needed to visit hill stations

The State government has decided to replace the existing system of issuing e-passes to those travelling from other States or countries with e-registration, Advocate General Vijay Narayan told the Madras High Court on Tuesday.

The Advocate General told the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy that the restrictions on visits to hill stations alone would continue, since those places were short on medical infrastructure.

After hearing him, the judges directed the State government to write to the Centre seeking a clarification as to whether imposition of such restrictions could continue on visits to hill stations and then publicise the reply through the media.

‘Basic details’

According to the A-G, the e-registration would require travellers to provide only basic details for the purpose of contact tracing.

On the other hand, e-passes to hill stations would be issued only to those who have an address there and not to tourists.

Unlike the plains, the medical facilities in hill stations were very limited. Hence, permitting tourists might lead to a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases and they might not be able to cope with such a situation, he said.

Self-regulation

The A-G also said at present, the only way to contain the spread of the pandemic was through self-regulation. Yet, people did not seem to understand the importance of wearing masks and maintaining physical distance, he said.

He also brought it to the notice of the court that the number of new COVID-19 cases had been limited to 5,000 every day due to effective steps taken by the government, as against Kerala where the numbers had now risen to as high as 10,000 cases a day. Concurring with the A-G, the Chief Justice said people were indeed moving around in public places without masks as if the disease had vanished. He said people could feel safe only when a vaccine comes out.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/coronavirus-e-registration-will-replace-e-pass-tn-govt-tells-court/article32848900.ece

Actor Rajinikanth has filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court challenging the demand of property tax to the tune of ₹6.50 lakh for his Raghavendra marriage hall located at Kodambakkam here.

His case against the demand made by the Greater Chennai Corporation for the half-yearly period, from April to September, has been listed for admission before Justice Anita Sumanth on Wednesday.

According to the case filed by the actor, through his counsel Vijayan Subramanian, he had been paying property tax regularly for the marriage hall. The tax was paid last on February 14.

Subsequently the pandemic broke out, forcing the Centre and State governments to impose a lockdown. As a result, his marriage hall had remained vacant and was not rented to anyone since March 24.

In such circumstances, the actor received a property tax invoice from the Corporation on September 10, asking him to pay ₹6.50 lakh as property tax for the months April through September.

Stating that he had cancelled all bookings for his marriage hall after March 24 and even refunded the advance money in accordance with the government instructions, the actor said he was entitled to vacancy remission on property tax.

He pointed out that Section 105 of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act of 1919 provides for remission of tax if the premises remained vacant for over 30 days and insisted on according the benefit to him.

The actor also said he had sent a notice in this regard to the Corporation on September 23 but there was no reply till date. He sought for a direction to the civic body to dispose of his notice and not levy penalty or interest till then.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/634nre/article32848919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TH-LT-RAJINIKANTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rajinikanth-moves-madras-high-court-against-tax-demand-for-marriage-hall/article32848920.ece

378,2020/10/14,Nalli Silks forays into U.K. market,"Firms opens first store in London with an investment of ₹2.86 crore

Chennai-headquartered Nalli Silks has opened its first store in London with support from the U.K.’s Department for International Trade (DIT). “We have invested approximately £300,000 (over ₹2.86 crore) for a 2,500 square feet store in Wembley and have picked an eight-member team to run the operations,” Lavanya Nalli, vice-chairperson, Nalli Silks, said. The firm, which previously gifted sarees to King George V and Queen Elizabeth, is expected to open more stores in London and Birmingham to serve U.K. customers. The U.K.’s Indian diaspora is estimated to be almost 1.5 million people. “We set up the business here based on our learnings from our other international expansions (U.S., Canada and Singapore),” Ms. Lavanya said, adding that the market potential was huge.

Demand for sarees for wedding season and COVID-19 travel restrictions prompted the firm to fast track the project. DIT officials in Chennai and London have been working with Nalli over the past 18 months to help facilitate site visits in the U.K., introductions to key tax services, and updates on COVID-19 related support measures – including the retail bounce-back announced by Exports Minister Graham Stuart.

“Our team from the Department of International Trade at the British Deputy High Commission in Chennai continues to work with Tamil Nadu-based investors like Nalli, who have shown immense faith in the U.K. market for their international expansion.

379,2020/10/14,Happy Paws comes to the rescue,"This small team of volunteers have rescued close to 260 animals

A year ago, a small group of people were individually rescuing abandoned and injured animals in and around Mogappair. Gradually, by word of mouth, they got together and today over 100 people quietly work as a team at ‘Happy Paws’ and have saved close to 260 animals.

Bharath Surya, 28, a resident of Mogappair, says that while he has been doing it for many years, it makes a world of difference when more people come forward to help. “We initially wanted to focus on one area and since we live here, we began with Mogappair. In the past one year, we work through a WhatsApp group and have rescued many dogs and cats that need immediate medical intervention and those that have been deserted by owners. When someone calls, one of us in the group provides some first aid on the spot or straight away take the animal to the veterinary clinic,” he said.

So far, they have vaccinated and sterilised several animals in the area. “In some cases, if an animal is abandoned, we first see the condition, provide care and then find a good home,” he adds.

Apart from dogs and cats, owls, crows, pigeons and even squirrels are cared for by many of the volunteers. Sudha Muthuvel, a 40-year-old resident of Mogappair, says, “Once an owl was almost strangled by a manja thread and in many instances we have helped crows and pigeons that got entangled in wires. There are many who drive or walk past an injured animal and even if they are not able to help, they can call us and one of us can rush to the spot”.

Mr. Surya says they have been gradually trying to expand and replicate this model in more areas.

382,2020/10/14,Krishna water diverted to Chembarambakkam,"Red Hills reservoir also will get the supply, say officials

With a steady inflow of the Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh, the Water Resources Department has started diverting water to Chembarambakkam reservoir and step up storage.

The State’s entry point on the Kandaleru-Poondi canal has so far received an inflow of 1.45 tmcft. since September 20. Officials of the WRD said the combined storage of the four reservoirs has improved after the release of Krishna water. The total storage in reservoirs now stands at nearly 5 tmcft. as against their capacity of 11.2 tmcft. The current storage would be sufficient to sustain drinking water supply till summer. At present, the supply in the city is maintained at 700 million litres a day on alternate days.

Low storage

The reservoirs that supply water to the city had a storage of 3.9 tmcft. in mid-September before the Krishna water started flowing into Poondi reservoir. “We have started transferring water from Poondi to Chembarambakkam reservoir through the link canal to boost its storage. Water is being drawn for city supply from the Chembarambakkam lake that now has a storage of only one-third of its capacity,” said an official.

“There may be a 15% loss of water during the process of diversion. We are continuing the work to remove vegetation and desilt the foreshore area of the lake for better water holding capacity,” the official added.

Krishna water would be let into Red Hills reservoir too, which has a better storage among the water bodies, in a few days depending on the demand. The department plans to increase patrolling in the areas around the lake and the link canal to prevent people from bathing in the water course.

Officials said Andhra Pradesh had assured Tamil Nadu of providing 4 tmcft of Krishna water in two months. “We will request for more water even after the onset of the northeast monsoon depending on the storage in reservoirs. Kandaleru reservoir has adequate storage to release water for the city’s requirement,” the official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/i3kr8t/article32848766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THKRISHNAWATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/krishna-water-diverted-to-chembarambakkam/article32848767.ece
383,2020/10/14,Corpn. plays down Koyambedu cases,"Only 50 persons were positive for COVID-19 out of 3,500 tested in two weeks, says official

The Greater Chennai Corporation has denied that the Koyambedu market complex would be closed again due to the rising number of COVID-19 positive cases among traders and workers.

Confirming that more than 50 persons had tested positive, a senior official of the civic body said that this had not happened on a single day but over a period of time after the wholesale vegetable market and food grains section reopened last month.

Pointing out that there was nothing alarming about 50 persons testing positive in the market, the senior official said tests were conducted on more than 3,500 persons in two weeks. He said the positivity rate was at a slightly more than 1%, but there was nothing to worry.

The market was closed on May 5 after it emerged as a COVID-19 hot spot. It all started during the last week of April when vendors in the city started to test positive for COVID-19. By early May, the Health Department acknowledged Koyambedu market to be a cluster as cases began to spread to other parts of the State. The Koyambedu cluster accounted for nearly 3,000 cases in the State by mid-May.

Health camps

Now, the civic body plans to organise health camps in the market regularly to keep the pandemic under check. The civic official said continuous testing along with individual precautions could alone keep the virus under control.

The civic body had said that the situation was under control and people need not fall prey to rumours of the market being proposed to be closed.

The Koyambedu market falls under the Kodambakkam zone where the number of positive cases had been the highest at 18,626 cases in the city. Anna Nagar stands second at 18,433 cases and Teynampet at 15,793 cases as per the figures of the civic body on Tuesday. The total active cases stood at 1,66,067.

Meanwhile, various traders’ associations demanded that the semi-wholesale vegetable shops must be opened as planned earlier and later reopen fruits and flowers sections in the market.

Association’s plea

Noting that only retailers who visited were tested positive for COVID-19, D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of All Traders’ Associations of Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex, on Tuesday said cases were not reported among wholesale merchants and labourers in the Koyambedu market.

“Rumours about an increasing number of cases in the market will affect the livelihood of about 50,000 families dependent on the trade. Several semi-wholesalers and retailers have remained out of business for the past six months,” he said.

Of the nearly 3,500 shops waiting to be reopened, about 1,700 shops were vegetable semi-wholesalers. Only 200 vegetable wholesale shops shifted from Thirumazhisai functioned at Koyambedu and were closed by 9 a.m.

The crowd had reduced to 30,000 people, including wholesale vendors, daily. The market is being monitored by camera surveillance and several norms were in place, he added.

M. Thyagarajan, president, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association, said prices of several vegetables had stabilised after the market was shifted to Koyambedu. Only a minimal number of cases had been reported so far. The government must take steps to reopen other sections of the market to protect livelihood of traders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wmw0lw/article32848760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THKOYAMBEDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corpn-plays-down-koyambedu-cases/article32848761.ece
384,2020/10/14,"Outline of a pandemic fight, by and for citizens","With changed public behaviour, officials need to recognise the potential of a decentralised control approach.

There needs to be a paradigm shift in the war against COVID-19; a war that has to be and can be fought with success mostly by citizens hereafter. If there is a wider awakening, the novel coronavirus can be handled by citizens. But how is one to raise that level of civic sense is the moot question.

Initially, we never thought that a calamity in Wuhan, China would reach our doorstep. Though the bad news was confirmed as an international emergency since the middle of January, it was only on March 11 that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic. Initially, all nations looked to WHO to be the technical lead, but once there was a reluctance to admit the droplet and aerosol mode of transmission, WHO lost its credibility. Even as doctors and scientists were getting to know the enemy virus, it landed in their midst.

Coronavirus | COVID-19 awareness campaign aims to reach out to 90 crore people

Gradual change

Using memories and experiences of conquering earlier viral outbreaks such as bird flu, Ebola, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, technocrats were using a mix bag of approaches. Gene sequences were shared and testing methods and kits developed and shared. Epidemiology is now better understood, with treatment modalities and experiences in reducing morbidity and mortality getting published. New approaches are being tried. No scientific tool has gone unutilised in the quest for answers. The war is on to save the infected.

Myths and misconceptions prevail despite WHO’s campiagn against “infodemics”. But we do have a better understanding of the virus and how it spreads.

Governments have been blamed for lapses such as having delayed stopping international flights, for the dynamics of the lockdowns, for job losses and poor management of migrant workers returning home, for a plummeting economy, for inadequate testing and contact tracing, and for lack of transparency in reporting of cases and deaths.

Column | The infodemic that accompanies the pandemic

Helping governments

In all this, people have learned one big lesson — of the need to look after and take care of themselves. We cannot depend on the government to do everything. We cannot rely on the predictions of technocrats. And, we should be able to interpret the assurances that politicians make. The novel coronavirus is still peaking in India and there is no evidence of the flattening of the epidemic curve in sight promised a few months ago. We need to be objective about debate on testing strategy, the accuracy of reporting deaths, the case load and the recovery rate, and the claims of success in the race for vaccine development. We need to focus on what to do by ourselves.

What matters to all of us is to stay away from the virus as far as possible and prevent it from infecting us. This responsibility lies squarely on us; not on the government. Such a realisation will not only aid us but also the government in the overall fight against COVID-19. The government can then concentrate on strengthening the health system to test and diagnose the infection and take care of those who are infected. The government can concentrate on hospitals and the related infrastructure.

Coronavirus | People optimistic but cautious about going back to normal life, finds survey across 7 cities

Our individual responsibility begins with self-protection. Mask wearing is the most important protection shield we have. In the fight against tuberculosis for example, doctors have been advocating its use for TB patients to minimise droplet spread of the TB bacteria. But very few have taken this advice seriously. In some areas, the police check two-wheeler riders for helmet-wearing and also for face masks. Our newly acquired cough and sneezing etiquette is going to stay as a habit to stop aerosol transmission. We are not going to clear our throats and spit anywhere, including from the windows of a moving vehicle. We have also been educated on washing our face and exposed areas of the body once we reach home and before we sit on furniture.

People are now observing handwashing. They even use sanitizers which are expensive. But in all this, not only can the spread of COVID-19 be stopped but also that of water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, jaundice, typhoid and even cholera. The novel coronavirus has taught us how to stand in a queue patiently. Physical distancing is now new social behaviour. We avoid crowding, festivals and processions, air-conditioned malls and shopping arcades, movie halls, displays and exhibitions. Even if all of these are allowed as an unlocking step, it is better we observe caution. We can go on a holiday or tour once it is safe to do so.

Editorial | Step up: On citizens’ responsibility during a pandemic

Community vigil

Though we were compelled to close places of worship, our attitude has changed to one of caring for the needs of others. But there is a need for changed behaviour by neighbourhood and social groups to prevent transmission. Virtual platforms must be used frequently to discuss the technical and administrative aspects of pandemic control by community groups. Volunteering for such community initiatives must be encouraged by elected representatives and members of local self government bodies. Self-administered and monitored epidemic prevention and community vigilance must be sustained. Monitoring of ground realities and learning from overseas experiences using smartphones, web connectivity and use of need-based new apps will all enhance the efficiency of this community empowerment.

Kerala had 45,000 registered community volunteers to run information desks and carry out screening at airports, railway stations and bus terminals and border check posts apart from carrying out contact tracing, and monitoring quarantine centres, running community kitchens and sanitation facilities. Odisha has its Gaon Unnayan Samitis and Andhra Pradesh its health link workers at the ward level. More States must emulate such initiatives to rope in the community. Reverse quarantine and the protection of the elderly, cancer patients and people with co-morbidities need to be exercises with more community involvement than of enforcement by health, revenue and police authorities.

Comment | The pandemic and the challenge of behaviour change

It is high time policymakers and officials realise the potential of such an approach of decentralised pandemic control. What we have now is patriarchal and technocentric, with unilateral information dissemination and enforcement of strategies either through health staff, the administration and the police. Now, the import of cases has been reduced and nearly 90% cases are through contacts. Finally, enable communities to take control of their own protection and stop community transmission. Invest time and budget for this process. Let their civic sense be the biggest armamentarium to flatten the pandemic curve.

385,2020/10/14,The Arab World and the elusive two-state solution,"The Arab World in a geopolitical sense no longer exists; the PLO leadership may have to think of a one-state solution

Words have meanings that are used and misused. A few weeks ago, someone with evident limitations fulminated against a category of faiths depicted as ‘Abrahamic’. Around the same time, the global media gleefully proclaimed the newly minted ‘Abraham Accord’ to describe a happening of political significance. Both expressions sought to trace it to the proper name, Abraham, a patriarchal entity who flourished in the Second Millennium BCE, is revered by three religions — Judaism, Christianity and Islam — and whose followers today account for a little over 55% of the world’s population. Mention is also made alongside of a group of languages as Semitic — principally Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic and Aramaic.

Language as fulcrum

Till the end of World War I, most of the Arabic-speaking lands of West Asia and North Africa were ruled directly or indirectly by the Ottoman Empire. Today, thanks to geopolitical cartography, they constitute the ‘Arab World’ whose 22 members are members of the UN. The point of commonality is the language.

The Hindu Explains | Why has the Israel-UAE pact unsettled Palestine and Iran?

The seeds of Arab nationalism were sown in the 19th century. The classic work of George Antonius, published in 1938, records the origins: ‘It was at a secret gathering of certain members of the Syrian Scientific Society that the Arab national movement may be said to have uttered its first cry.’ A poem by one of its members gave it the battle cry: Arise, ye Arabs, and awake! The poem, viewed as seditious by the Ottoman rulers, did much to foster the national movement in its infancy.

A critique

In 1945 and reportedly on British prompting, the League of Arab States was formed to ‘draw closer the relations between member states and co-ordinate their political activities with the aim of realising a close collaboration between them, to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, and to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries’. It has achieved none of its objectives and its hopes have been ‘worn down to disillusion and cynicism’ emanating from what Bassam Tibi has called ‘the duality of words and deeds’.

The critique of mystifications of Arab nationalism was a promise; but the promise of getting light at the end of the tunnel did not bear the expected results. This was attributed by a UNDP Human Development Report many years ago to deficits of knowledge, freedom and empowerment of women. Thus, absence of participatory governance and its institutions, disregard for individual freedoms, and the prevalence of one-person rule resulted in what Abdullah Laroui characterised as ‘living in Infra-historical rhythm’. Admittedly, sectional though uneven progress was made, but as the experience of the Arab Uprising of 2011 showed, deep disagreements prevented the emergence of an Arab order and its impact on ‘Arab unity’. It was most evident in their responses to regional and global problems.

The Hindu In Focus podcast | How the Israel-UAE peace agreement changes the game in the Middle East

The Palestine issue

The one problem on which Arab states professed unity of opinion, but not necessarily of approach, related to Palestine and to the demand for a Palestinian state. After multiple resorts to war and popular uprisings, the tenacity of Israel and its American backers forced the Arab states and their international supporters to accept the Camp David and Oslo Accords and finally the Saudi-sponsored 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. It involved a de facto recognition of Israel and the latter accepted it with 14 reservations.

The truth behind this Saudi initiative has now been made public in a series of television interviews on Al-Arabiya channel on October 5 by the former Saudi Ambassador to the United States and later intelligence chief, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan. It is candid and revealing and sheds much light on the Saudi suspicion of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leadership, beginning but not ending with Yasser Arafat.

Editorial | Limited peace: On UAE-Israel peace agreement

The ostensible reason for this, according to some Arab-American commentators, is ‘perceived threat from Iran, the spread of regional terrorism and the rise of Islamism’. The take-off occasion, according to them, was the conference in Warsaw in February 2019 that was hailed by Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu as ‘a breakthrough in Arab-Israeli relations’. This could be seen as a stage in the success of Israel’s grand strategy candidly spelt out in Yossi Alpher’s 2015 book, Periphery, aimed to outflank the hostile core that surrounds it and gain the major political-security goal of countering Arab hostility through relations with alternate regional powers and potential allies. It has been furthered by post-2011 developments in individual Arab countries and the aura bestowed on ‘political Islam’ or Islamism presented by its protagonists such as Fahmy Howeidy who argued that Arab nationalism is a stage towards greater Islamic unity.

Public opinion vs. policy

Do these failures to jolt the system at the individual-country and regional levels have an impact on perceptions of the Palestinian problem? The Arab Center Washington DC and its Arab Opinion Index for 2019-2020 published last week concluded that 79% of the respondents felt ‘the Palestinian cause concerns all Arabs and not the Palestinian people alone’. This figure in 2012-2013 was 84%. It is thus difficult not to conclude that opinion at the public/respondent level is not in step with official policy orientation on this question. Does this in any manner further the Palestinian cause, more so because the direction of Israeli policy premised on incremental creation of facts on the ground together with furtherance of practical cooperation with individual Arab countries would inevitably result in de facto annexation of most parts of the West Bank even if a formal annexation is deferred?

Editorial | New order in West Asia: On Abraham Accords

A way out

The PLO leadership has been left high and dry even if not yet disowned by its own people. Would the new situation propel it to recraft its policies? The promised Two-state solution is nowhere in sight except for some variants of Bantustans. Would it not be better to explore a One-state solution even if involves a South Africa-like apartheid that would sooner or later prick the conscience of world opinion and their governments and allow a Palestinian-Mandela to use Gandhian principles to seek justice?

News Analysis | What’s next for Palestine after UAE, Bahrain deals with Israel?

So the Arab World in a geopolitical sense no longer exists. It will retain its focus on linguistic homogeneity and attendant cultural glory. As for the Palestinians and in the event of hard tactical options being forsaken, they might even explore the creation of a Palestinian point of lamentation, a ‘wailing wall’, hoping that divine justice would eventually be forthcoming as has been with their Abrahamic cousins.

The announcements regarding the LTC scheme must be examined with care. The government has stopped the DA of Union government employees up to July 2021. Further, government employees are perhaps the only ones whose income has not been affected by the pandemic. It is clear that the pandemic-induced economic dislocation will not end this year and the government is unwilling to stretch its finances further. The government needs to think of transfers and enabling direct spending on goods and services.

Move to BJP

It is natural for the public to view actor and former Congress spokesperson Kushboo Sundar’s move to quit the Congress and join the BJP as one more instance of the opportunism of an ambitious politician. Still, for the Congress high command, the development should be a wakeup call, indicating that all is not well within the Tamil Nadu unit of the party. The comment made by the TNCC president, K.S. Alagiri, immediately after her resignation was in very bad taste. Had the TNCC president thanked her for her services to the party until she left it, it would have only enhanced the stature of the party and his.

S.P. Asokan,

Tiruchi, Tamil Nadu

It was amusing to see the kind of prominence given to the news of Ms. Sundar joining the BJP, with even a timeline of her political career. One only hopes that her ‘ardent wish’ to serve the people of this country is duly recognised by the party she has now joined and that it acts in accordance.

T. Yoganandh,

Salem, Tamil Nadu

Ms. Sundar, or any other person, is totally free in a democratic system to leave or join a political party at any time. But the question that now arises is whether politicians who often keep changing their political loyalties are genuinely devoted to their party ideologies or treat politics just like any other job which can be discarded. Such habitual party hoppers more often prove to be perennially unsure, diffident and opportunistic persons in their constant quest to seek greener pastures.

A. Mohan,

Chennai

Ms. Sundar must remember that she was appointed as a national spokesperson, a high profile post, which is normally assigned to senior partymen, well versed in current affairs and with good command over the language. One cannot buy her argument that it was her duty to attack the policies of government as a person in the Opposition. It exposes her political dishonesty. Will the same argument apply if she quits the BJP?

I am a reader of the daily for well over 60 years and wonder what was so important for a prestigious newspaper to publish this news on the front page. I remember the legendary Y.B. Chavan’s passing being reported on page 9. Have times changed?

Was it necessary to devote so much newsprint for a novice in politics? One should never underestimate the feelings of the people of Tamil Nadu as they are aware of the chameleons in politics.

388,2020/10/14,How restaurants in Chennai are offering everyday essentials that make cooking at home a breeze,"From ready-to-use dosa and vada batter, to podis that can be had with hot rice are available

“We are talking about the new normal, but I think that too is constantly changing,” says NS Krishnamoorthy, proprietor Prem’s Grama Bhojanam, a restaurant that specialises in millet-based food.

“Three months ago, there were no takers even for takeaways, but over the past few weeks, customers have gradually started walking in. On our part, we are playing it safe and pruned our menu to avoid wastage and serve customers with the inadequate manpower we have,” he says.

The pandemic has encouraged restaurateurs to manage resources, while adapting to a rapidly changing market. “We launched millet idli and dosa batter during lockdown. Of course, everyone was actively cooking at home then, but dosa batter saves them time. We also sell kollu podi, pandu mirapakaya (ripe chilli) pickle, multi-vegetable, lemon and gongura pickle, all of which get sold out in no time,” adds Krishnamoorthy.

Peanut chutney Recipe: N.S.Krishanmoorthy

Ingredients

Peanut 250 grams

Tamarind, size of gooseberry

Kashmiri chilli 2

Dry red chilli 2

Cumin 1 teaspoon

Jaggery 1 teaspoon

Crystal salt as per taste

Method

Dry roast the peanut on a slow flame and allow it to cool. In little oil roast both variety of chilli and add to peanut. In mixer grinder, grind to coarse paste all the ingredients along with peanut and chillies. If serving immediately, you can add water or buttermilk. Or else this powder can be stored in airtight container in fridge for upto a month. When required, take the powder in a bowl, add butter milk or water and use as chutney.

A delivery-only restaurant with five cloud kitchens across the city, Suvai Bhavan, offers stay at home specials, where three types of vada batter (masala, medhu and keerai vada); pesarattu batter; idli and dosa batter; rava and ragi dosa premix and rava kesari premix, are home delivered. Accompaniments can be ordered separately.

“We opened during lockdown to cater to people who preferred restaurant-style food at affordable rates. An essential everyday requirement such as ready-to-use batter has gone down well with customers,” says Nitin Suresh, general manager, SPI Diners, who own the brand.

Nalina Kannan of Thaligai, a South Indian vegetarian restaurant, had plans to open another branch in the city. This has stalled due to the pandemic, so she shifted focus.

“My kulambu and rasam powders are popular among our regular customers. Unable to come to the restaurant, they began inquiring about my podis. Which is why I decided to sell them online,” says Nalina. Assisted by two helpers and a head chef, Nalina oversees the preparation, where every day, they make eight to 10 kilograms of podi.

“Orders are couriered across India. I hope to make work from home easy for people, and such varieties come in handy in everyday cooking. Each of our podis has dual utility,” she explains.

For example, her coconut podi can be mixed with hot rice. It can also be used as flavouring for vegetable stew. She adds, “Similarly, curry leaves podi can be mixed in tamarind water, boiled and garnished to make a gravy or just added to hot rice and ghee.” Thaligai also offers idli and dosa batter.

With many people still working from home, podis, pickles and ready-to-use batter make meal planning easier. As popular Chef K Damodaran sums it up, “Sourcing ready to use essentials gives you the feel of enjoying restaurant food in the safety and comfort of your home. This is a win-win situation for restaurants and customers.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/iqr6vd/article32854625.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPsuvaiDosa-batter,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-better-batter/article32854626.ece
389,2020/10/14,Pulicat prawns go online: Fishermen to home deliver them in Chennai,"Small boat fishermen at Pulicat unite to sell prawns, crabs and fish online

For the longest time, fisherman M Suman has dreamed of selling the fish he catches himself.

“I have been fishing from the age of eight with my father,” says the 36-year-old from Pulicat. “Wholesale buyers and sellers who depend on us have prospered. We fishermen struggle financially,” he adds.

Since the catch changes hands at least twice before reaching the final buyer, the fisherman walks away with a low profit. “After going to sea, I come back exhausted, and don’t have the energy to sell the catch,” says Suman.

The pandemic made life tougher for small-boat fishermen such as him. “Once lockdown was eased, we ended up with excess, unsold fish. Then, gradually, people started coming to our markets to buy in bulk. We were overwhelmed by the sudden demand,” says A Mugan, leader of the Pulicat Youth Federation. “That’s when we came up with the idea of selling our catch online.”

Xavier Benedict, the founder of AARDE, designed the website, which was launched last week. For the first time in history, Pulicat’s prawns, crabs, and fish caught by small-boat fishermen, were put up for sale online.

Suman’s tone over phone is enough to suggest that he has a huge grin on his face. “Hopefully, we too can go to the next level in our business.” Suman knows buying fish online is nothing new. “I myself supply to some online retailers,” he adds.

But there is a difference: “Once customers place their order, we will let them know if it is available only once the boat arrives. We will also send them photos and videos of their fish being packed,” he explains. “This way, they are assured of fresh fish that is not stored with ice. Anyone who has tasted Pulicat fish will know that it is superior in quality and taste.”

The order will be delivered early next morning. “Right now, we have vans leaving Pulicat at 2 am for fishmarkets at Saidapet, Red Hills, Chintadripet, and Vanagaram; we plan to transport our customers’ orders in these vans. Delivery will be done through delivery portals we have tied up with,” explains Suman.

Mugan says that if things go well, orders will be delivered no less than two hours after the catch arrives. “We set out for fishing in two batches: from 3 am to 10 am and from 3 pm to 8 pm. If more orders start coming in, members from our federation will deliver the fish themselves,” he adds. Think about it: a fisherman at your doorstep with the fish he caught.

390,2020/10/14,17-year-old girl detained for killing 3-year-old neighbour,"When the boy fell unconscious while playing, the girl panicked, put him in a jute sack, and threw it behind their building from a window

The Rabale police have solved the murder case of a three-year-old boy from Ghansoli by detaining his neighbour, a 17-year-old girl.

Omkar Shankar Sathe, who turned three on September 5, went missing around 12 p.m. on September 18 while playing outside his house in Balaram Wadi. His mother had stepped out to buy chicken, while his father, a painter, and his grandmother, a vegetable seller, were out on work. Omkar’s mother last spotted him playing on the ground floor, while his two sisters — aged six and nine — were playing on the first floor.

Police inspector Giridhar Gore said, “We suspected the girl, but since she was a juvenile, we needed a confession. We approached her in amicable ways with the help of a child psychologist and lawyers, and she confessed.” Mr. Gore said the girl told them that Omkar came to her house on the first floor to play and suddenly fell unconscious. She panicked, put him in a jute sack, and threw it behind the building from a window. Mr. Gore said, “We found a similar sack from her house. Her parents worked as labourers in a garment factory and were out for work when the incident occurred. She was alone at home, while her siblings were playing on the ground floor.”

The autopsy report had ruled out strangulation and head injuries as the cause of death. Mr. Gore said, “He died due to suffocation inside the sack.” The girl, a Class IX student, has been sent to a juvenile home on the charge of murder.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vyzlij/article22934093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-handcuff,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/17-year-old-girl-detained-for-killing-3-year-old-neighbour/article32856893.ece
391,2020/10/14,Retreating monsoon wreaks havoc across Maharashtra,"Six killed in Pandharpur as portion of river embankment wall caves in

The retreating monsoon wreaked havoc over several parts of Maharashtra, especially the western part of the State and the Marathwada region, with Solapur being particularly hit-hard.

At least six people, including three women and one minor, were killed and two more injured in Pandharpur after heavy rain caused a portion of an embankment wall near the Chandrabhaga river to cave in, authorities said on Wednesday.

District authorities said that the wall of the newly constructed Kumbhar Ghat crumbled after 2 p.m., killing six of the eight people standing on the ghat wall.

Four of the deceased have been identified as Gopal Laxman Abhangrao (70), his son, Mangesh Abhangrao (35), Radhabai Gopal (50), Umesh Jagtap (13), while two other warkari women are yet to be identified.

Officials said two other men, buried in the debris, were rescued despite relief work being hampered by the intensity of the showers.

The temple town of Pandharpur has been particularly afflicted with rains throwing life awry. Power supply has been disrupted in many parts of Solapur city with rains battering the district for the last three days. Wall cave-ins have been reported in a number of places, with a portion of the tower of the palace at Akkalkot collapsing, while the road connecting the town of Vairag with Jawalgaon village in Barshi taluk was submerged.

With the district witnessing near-continuous rain for the last 48 hours, a high- alert has been issued by the district administration. Solapur had received 79 mm of rainfall till 5:30 p.m., said India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities.

Authorities have warned residents not to step out. Farmers have been acutely afflicted with rain destroying grape and pomegranate fruit orchards and crops like maize and jowar. Very heavy rains in the catchment areas of the Ujjani dam near Pandharpur caused a massive discharge of 20,000 cusecs of water since Tuesday.

Traffic within Solapur city and the rural parts were thrown off-kilter as two-wheelers and four-wheelers were seen struggling to reach their destinations through waterlogged roads.

The showers caused the lake near the famous Siddheshwar Temple complex in Solapur city to overflow, with waters entering the temple for the first time in over two decades. Elsewhere in western Maharashtra, Pune city and parts of the district, too, were steadily lashed by showers late afternoon onwards.

Orange alert in Pune

The IMD has issued an ‘orange alert’ for Pune over the next two days and a ‘yellow alert’ for October 16, while a ‘red alert’ has been issued for Kolhapur.

“Thunderstorms accompanied with lightning and heavy rainfall very likely to occur at isolated places in north Maharashtra, including the districts of Dhule, Nandurbar, Nashik and Jalgaon as well as over Pune and adjoining areas over the next couple of days,” said a senior IMD official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/z290u0/article32856811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMMUMBAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/retreating-monsoon-wreaks-havoc-across-maharashtra/article32856812.ece

396,2020/10/14,Power supply restored in Navi Mumbai,"Technical issues sorted; rotational load balancing called off

The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) called off rotational load balancing in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region in the early hours of Tuesday after sorting out the technical issues that led to a power failure in the city on Monday.

The exercise had caused some parts in Navi Mumbai to remain without electricity for over 13 hours. “As per orders from higher authorities, we kept switching the feeders. By 12.30 a.m. on Tuesday, all feeders were functioning well. Now, power supply is normal,” said the MSEDCL PRO.

MSEDCL officials refuted reports that there would be load shedding in Navi Mumbai for a few more days. “Electricity in most places in Navi Mumbai was restored by 10 p.m. The last batch received power by 12.30 a.m.,” superintendent engineer Rajaram Mane of Vashi Circle said.

The MSEDCL PRO said there was a power outage at Rabodi in Thane for 30 minutes on Tuesday due to repair work by the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL) on the 400 kV Kalwa-Talegaon line. “The insulator got damaged due to thundering a few days ago and work on the line is still on.

397,2020/10/14,Don’t test the patience of devotees: BJP to MVA govt.,"Party holds Statewide protest demanding reopening of temples

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday held a Statewide agitation demanding the reopening of temples across Maharashtra.

BJP State president Chandrakant Patil said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government should not test the patience of saints, priests and devotees. He said, “The government must immediately reopen temples and other places of worship. Don’t wait for the situation to arise where all these people will forcefully barge into temples.”

Mr. Patil said it is beyond understanding that at a time when businesses are reopening, the government is reluctant to reopen temples.

The Thane unit of the party led by MLAs Niranjan Davkhare and Sanjay Kelkar rang bells as part of a “ghanta naad” protest in front of Ghantali temple, while BJP workers led by party MLA Atul Save performed a puja and sang bhajans outside Gajanan Maharaj temple in Aurangabad city.

“The government didn’t give a single rupee to these people. Hence, we want to make the government aware of these facts,” Mr. Save said.

Tushar Bhosle, leader of the BJP’s spiritual wing, said though the Centre has given the go-ahead, the State government is only allowing bars to open, but not temples. “Last month, we organised a ‘ghanta naad’ agitation, but the government cannot hear and see us,” Mr. Bhosle said.

Actor Kangana Ranaut, who had a tiff with the Shiv Sena and the State government after she compared Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, welcomed Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s letter to the CM, calling for the reopening of temples. She tweeted, “Nice to know Gunda government is being questioned by Honourable Governor sir, Gundas have opened bars and restaurants but strategically keeping temples shut. Sonia Sena is behaving worse than Babur Sena.”

398,2020/10/14,"Governor, CM spar over reopening of temples","‘I don’t need your certificate for my Hindutva,’ says Thackeray in response to Koshyari’s letter

The issue of opening of temples in Maharashtra led to a “letter war” between Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, with the former questioning the Shiv Sena leader’s Hindu credentials. The CM was prompt to reply that he did not require any certificate of Hindutva from the Governor.

After visits by several delegations of the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders demanding opening of temples, Mr. Koshyari wrote to Mr. Thackeray on Monday, asking whether he has suddenly turned ‘secular’ and if he is receiving ‘divine premonition’ to keep postponing the reopening of places of worship.

‘Turning secular?’

Mr. Koshyari wrote, “I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of the places of worship time and again or have you suddenly turned ‘secular’ yourselves, the term you hated?” Mr. Koshyari said it is ironic that on the one hand the government has permitted the opening of bars and restaurants, while on the other, our gods and goddesses have been condemned to remain in lockdown.

In response, Mr. Thackeray, in his letter on Tuesday, said, “I appreciate the mention of Hindutva in your letter, but my Hindutva does not require your certificate. My Hindutva does not appreciate welcoming a person with a smile, who termed my State or the capital of my State as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir [PoK].” Mr. Thackeray was making a veiled reference to actor Kangana Ranaut, who compared Mumbai to PoK and visited Mr. Koshyari at Raj Bhavan to share her concerns.

“Do you consider opening temples as Hindutva and not opening them as secularism? Then what about the Constitution, by which you were sworn in as Governor? Secularism is a core principle of the Constitution. Don’t you follow the Constitution?” asked Mr. Thackeray.

He added, “You seem puzzled as to whether I get divine premonition. I am not as great as you are and therefore I have not such experiences like you. I only observe good and bad things happening in other States and work honestly to do better in Maharashtra.”

Taunting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to abruptly declare a nationwide lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19, Mr. Thackeray said, “The government’s priority is to save people’s lives while safeguarding their emotions and beliefs. Just as it is wrong to abruptly implement lockdown, it is wrong to suddenly revoke it.” He said the government is currently undertaking the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign, which involves door-to-door health check-ups. “Maharashtra is the only State in the country to do so,” he said.

Exposing the politics behind the demand to reopen temples, Mr. Thackeray pointed out that all three delegations that met Mr. Koshyari were by BJP office-bearers and supporters. “It could be a coincidence. Let that be. The State government is seriously thinking over these demands and a decision in this regard will be taken at the earliest,” he said.

Allies support Uddhav

Talking to reporters, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut was critical of the Governor’s letter. He stresed on the Sena’s commitment to Hindutva. “Nobody should have a question in mind about whether one is Hindutvavadi or not. It only needs to be seen if the government is being run as per the Constitution or not,” he said, without naming Mr. Koshyari.

State Congress chief and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said Mr. Koshyari is also the Governor of the BJP-ruled Goa, where places of worship are still closed on account of the novel coronavirus. “What the Governor has said goes against the principle of secularism in the Constitution. We think this is not right. Does the President approve of the language used in the Governor’s letter?” Mr. Thorat asked.

400,2020/10/14,"Puducherry Minister writes letter to Lt Governor, accuses her of “vengeful” attitude towards fishermen","In a letter to Lt Governor Kiran Bedi, Minister Malladi Krishna Rao said her attitude had resulted in the stalling of the disbursal of enhanced pensions and other assistance for the fisher community

Minister for Health Malladi Krishna Rao has accused Lt Governor Kiran Bedi of adopting a “vengeful,” attitude towards the fishermen community in the Union Territory.

In a letter to Ms. Bedi on Wednesday, the Minister said the “vengeful” attitude of the Lt Governor had resulted in the stalling of the disbursal of an enhanced pension scheme for the elderly in the community, the trawling ban assistance and the implementation of employment-oriented schemes in the fishing sector.

Mr. Rao, who also holds the fishing portfolio, said the Cabinet had decided to enhance the pension for elderly fishermen. After much delay, the Lt Governor cleared the proposal in March this year and accordingly the pension was disbursed for April. When the file was presented again to her for sanction to implement the enhanced pension after presenting a full budget, the Lt Governor refused to give permission citing funds crunch. She wanted the government to revert to the earlier pension scheme. The decision of the Lt Governor had affected the life of around 7,855 fishermen families, the Minister said.

Many fishermen are yet to receive the ban relief assistance due to various restrictions imposed by the Lt Governor, he said.

The government of India had proposed to establish a fish processing units in Puducherry and Karaikal region for exporting products. But the Lt Governor refused to give permission and instead suggested setting up of dairy and honey production units. The suggestion was not feasible as there was already a shortage in milk production and there was lack of availability of honey, the Minister said.

“This shows her intentional vengeance towards the fishermen community,” he alleged.

Stating that he had decided not to collect a salary or any allowance as a measure to bring down expenditure, the Minister requested the Lt Governor to cut down the expenditure of Raj Nivas too.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/4pm055/article32853372.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14OCTTH--MALLADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-minister-writes-letter-to-lt-governor-accuses-her-of-vengeful-attitude-towards-fishermen/article32853373.ece
401,2020/10/14,"L-G hiding facts on rice, medical admission: CM","Bedi is giving false information to the public, says Narayanasamy

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has accused Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi of ‘hiding’ certain facts while issuing statements on medical admission controversy and rice distribution issue.

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, the Chief Minister said Ms. Bedi had failed to openly acknowledge the fact that the Central Bureau of Investigation had cleared all charges she had levelled against senior officials involved in the admission process.

Recently, the Madras High Court while imposing fine on private medical colleges for committing irregularities, did not find any wrong-doing by the officials. The government had always maintained its stand that the admission procedure followed by the Centralised Admission Committee (Centac) was proper and as per rules.

The government was in favour of taking action against the private colleges if they were found guilty of wrong-doing in admission process by not admitting the students recommended by Centac.

The government’s views on the issue was communicated to the Medical Council of India. However, it was the Lt. Governor who recommended a CBI probe against government officials overseeing the admission process. The agency closed the case as it found that the officials were not guilty, the Chief Minister said.

“The court recently gave its judgement imposing fine on the colleges for irregularities in the admission process. Ms. Bedi was quick to say the court judgment was a Diwali gift to the people of the Union Territory,” he said.

The Chief Minister sought to know from the Lt. Governor whether making false complaints against the officials and harassing them was any sort of Diwali gift.

“It is Ms. Bedi who is giving false information to the public. She has never acknowledged the closure of a case recommended by her,” Mr. Narayanasamy said.

Responding to the Lt. Governor’s statement that the judiciary and the Centre had approved her stand on direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode for implementing welfare schemes, the Chief Minister said the court has not given any final judgement on DBT for free rice scheme.

“I have appealed against the single Bench order on transfer of money instead of providing free rice. And the case is likely to come up next month. How can someone say that the judiciary has upheld her decision when the appeal is still pending,” the Chief Minister said.

Stating that free rice was one of the commitments given by the party during elections and it was a policy matter of the government, the Chief Minister said “the Lt. Governor has no right to interfere in policy matters.”

The Chief Minister said it was also wrong on her part to state that the Centre had concurred with her stand. The former Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Food and Public Distribution, late Ram Vilas Paswan, was in favour of distributing rice, he said. “He clearly said if the government wanted to distribute rice it was free to do so. We even asked the Minister to supply rice through the FCI,” he said.

On Lt. Governor’s statement that distribution of rice would lead to corruption, the Chief Minister said majority of the States, including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, were distributing rice through public distribution outlets. “So does it mean the distribution process in these States is corrupt,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/lvn1up/article32848894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/l-g-hiding-facts-on-rice-medical-admission-cm/article32848895.ece

403,2020/10/14,Expedite constitution of welfare board for informal workers: CPI(M),"‘Labour force in the Union Territory are facing loss of job and social security’

The Puducherry unit of the CPI(M) has urged the government to expedite constitution of the Informal Workers Welfare Board to offer lifeline to a labour segment worst hit by the pandemic.

In a memorandum to the Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, CPI (M) secretary R. Rajangam said the labour force in the Union Territory had the largest number of informal workers and this section was facing loss of job security and social security.

Pointing out that many workers were depressed, unable to pay for food, rent and meet children's needs and a few had committed suicide, the CPI(M) leader said the failure of the government to implement its own assurance for a board was a matter of concern.

He pointed out that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance passed the Informal Workers Protection Act in 2009. The Informal Workers Welfare Board was also an assurance given in the Assembly in 2019.

During subsequent negotiations with the workers, it was promised that the Welfare Board would be constituted by January 10, 2020, with a Diwali allowance of ₹1000 for 2019 have not materialised.

There was also a union demand for providing assistance of ₹1,000 as corona relief to informal workers who were not registered with the welfare society.

However, about 8,000 workers, including tailors, who are members of the welfare society, have not been given any aid. The government had also announced that it would follow the Centre in extending vehicle insurance/renewal/road tax validity for rental vehicles engaged in transportation till the end of the year, but had failed to implement it.

The 26.7-km Reach I from Kazhakuttam to Mukkola of the 43-km Kazhakuttam-Karode NH 66 Bypass offers hassle-free connectivity to Thiruvananthapuram airport, Technopark, Kovalam, Akkulam tourist village and Shanghumughom. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the Reach 1 through videoconference on Tuesday.

Besides decongesting the city, the project further boosts the prospects of the upcoming Vizhinjam seaport. The road connectivity to the seaport is from the 16.3 km Reach II from Mukkola to Karode.

The commissioning of the upcoming 2.7-km four-lane flyover at Kazhakuttam for hassle-free entry to Technopark in April 2021 and the Reach II will further decongest the city.

At ₹1,120.86 crore

The National Highways Authority of India that executed the four-laning in Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode, overcoming several hurdles, including opposition from the local residents, saw the cost of the NH four-laning going up from ₹778.41 crore sanctioned for construction and ancillary works in 2015 to ₹1,120.86 crore in 2020.

Construction of the 1.6-km four-lane flyover in front of the airport at ₹142 crore, a two-lane bridge parallel to the existing one at Akkulam and the rail overbridge at Chakka were the main hurdles.

In his address, Mr. Gadkari said the bypass project would increase transportation efficiency, decrease transportation cost and enhance the infrastructural development thereby boosting overall development of the region, reducing accidents, providing connectivity to tourist destinations and historical/religious places.

The shelving of the overpass at Eenchakkal Junction is going to be a major headache for traffic personnel.

406,2020/10/14,Smart mosquito surveillance system for Thiruvananthapuram,"Mayor K. Sreekumar on Tuesday inaugurated the installation of the Smart Mosquito Surveillance System as part of the civic body’s Smart City project. The system makes use of various technologies to alert the Corporation’s health wing regarding the location, density and type of mosquito population.

With this information, the authorities can plan selective fumigation of the areas and then monitor the effect it had on the mosquito population. Smart Mosquito Surveillance System eliminates blind spraying of fumigation and thus enables Smart Fumigation.

Sensors

The system consists of a number of smart mosquito sensors, located around the city and a dashboard set up in the Integrated command and control centre at the Corporation. Sensors would be located in most susceptible areas where mosquitoes are likely to breed, including waterbodies, hospitals and markets. Areas with a high number of reported dengue or malaria cases in recent years, high human population density, and poor sanitation would be targeted in the beginning.

Types and density

These sensors capture and identify mosquito types and density. The sensors would report this information over the telecom network to a server on a regular basis. These sensors use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to classify mosquitoes using wing beat, circadian rhythm, height of flight and location parameters. The system is expected to become functional by December.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/smart-mosquito-surveillance-system-for-thiruvananthapuram/article32849932.ece
407,2020/10/14,"Capital posts 777 cases, 815 recoveries","Chief Minister hints at dip in disease transmission rate

The district reported 777 more COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, but there was also some good news for a change.

The rate of transmission of the disease appears to have slowed down in Thiruvananthapuram, according to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

The district also did not report any new deaths due to COVID-19 on Tuesday.

Stiff challenge

“COVID-19 had posed a stiff challenge in Thiruvananthapuram district, but the transmission rate has declined. This can be attributed to the exemplary action jointly taken by various departments. The people of the district also responded on a positive note,” Mr. Vijayan said.

That notwithstanding, the response has been disappointing in crowded places such as fish markets, street-side shops and eateries where physical distancing and other Break-the-Chain measures were lax. This was not a good tendency, the Chief Minister said.

Private tuition centres are a cause for concern, according to the Chief Minister. “Many children are resorting to such centres for preparing for online exams. Parents should note that the percentage of children below the age of 15 testing positive for COVID-19 is high in the district,” he said.

Of Tuesday’s caseload, local transmission accounted for 680 cases, while the source of infection was vague in 62 cases.

62 children

In all, 326 women and 451 men newly tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This included 62 children below the age of 15 and 137 persons above 60.

As many as 24 health-care workers also were diagnosed with the disease on the day.

The total number of recoveries stood at 815. A total of 11,475 persons are under treatment for COVID-19 at present.

On Tuesday alone, 2,368 persons were newly quarantined in the district.

Containment zones

The central region on Wednesday recorded a sharp drop in COVID-19 cases with 416 patients testing positive for the viral infection. Seven deaths, two each in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur and one each in Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Nagapattinam were recorded.

In Thanjavur, a 65-year-old man suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome, and a 72-year-old man with a history of diabetes died of COVID-19. A 61-year-old man with a history of bronchial asthma, and a 64-year-old man with a comorbidity of diabetes succumbed to the viral infection in Tiruvarur.

A 70-year-old man from Tiruchi with a history of obstructive pulmonary disease, a 29-year-old woman from Ariyalur who suffered from anemia and thrombocytopenia and a 73-year-old man from Nagapattinam with a history of systemic hypertension succumbed to COVID-19 according to the bulletin released by the Department of Health and Family Welfare.

While Thanjavur continued to record the highest number of COVID cases amongst the central districts, the total number of cases recorded per day fell below 100 with 97 patients testing positive on Wednesday.

Tiruvarur recorded 80 fresh cases for the viral infection while Tiruchi recorded 68 of whom many were primary contacts and patients with a history of respiratory illnesses.

415,2020/10/14,COVID-19 cases in Perambalur district lowest in State,"Perambalur district recorded the lowest number of COVID-19 cases among all districts in Tamil Nadu over the last six months.

Senior officials attribute it to intensive testing and low population density. With a population of around 6.41 lakh, personal distancing is practised, said V. Santha, Collector. “We do not have to force people to follow the norms as the number of people per square km is markedly low,” she said.

The COVID-19 testing facility can process up to 800 samples, and while at least 400 to 500 are being lifted per day, the cases have not crossed the 20-mark in six weeks, she added. As on Wednesday, a total of 2013 patients had tested positive. Among them, 1911 have been discharged and only 82 active cases remain.

Deputy Director of Health Services S. Geetharani said that while in larger districts, apartments, gated communities and congested areas were causes for spread of the viral infection, Perambalur did not have any such contributing factors.

Of the 1209 returnees from other countries, only one person had tested positive. After attending the single-source event in New Delhi, only one man and three of his contacts tested positive in the district. People who had been working at the Koyambedu market and tested positive on return accounted for 130 cases. However, since quarantine norms were in place, the spread was significantly controlled. “We had the infrastructure in place since March,” Dr. Geetharani said.

While the positivity rate was as high as 13% between July and August, it has fallen to 1.3% since September. “The biggest challenge was a large manufacturing company with over 5,000 employees. To keep a check on spread of the infection, a team of health officials should conduct a screening test at least once a month,” Dr. Geetharani said. A special 50-bed quarantine facility has also been kept ready there.

A total of 13 medical camps, all Primary Healthcare Centres and the four government hospitals are fully equipped to handle it, in case another spike is recorded, she said adding- “Through close monitoring of the Influenza-Like Illnesses, Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses and 10 other factors, we can easily predict the spike or drop in COVID-19 cases.

416,2020/10/14,Plea for track doubling,"The Thanjavur District Railway Users Association has urged the DMK Rajya Sabha member M. Shanmugam to prevail upon the Railway Board to approve doubling of the Thanjavur - Villupuram mainline section for operation of more trains in this route, its secretary in-charge A. Giri said in a memorandum submitted to him recently.

The section was one of the important stretches in the Tiruchi Railway Division. Thanjavur, Kumbakonam and Mayiladuthurai were important revenue generating stations with high levels of passenger patronage and footfalls. They also have regular outward freight consignments of sugar and rice and inward consignment of fertilizer and cement.

The traffic capacity on the Thanjavur - Villupuram section had reached the saturation level with 104 % in Mayiladuthurai - Villupuram section and 95 % in the Thanjavur- Mayiladuthurai stretch. Passengers on the mainline section were deprived of required long distance trains as the stretch was a single line. Travelling public, trade bodies and consumer organisations have been consistently demanding doubling of the section which serves an alternative route to the chord line stretch from Tiruchi to Villupuram via Srirangam, Ariyalur and Vriddhachalam. Stations in the very old mainline section such as Thanjavur, Papanasam, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai, Chidambaram and Cuddalore fetch good revenue for the railways.

Rukmini Devi Arundale told Shoba Naidu that she would do a great service to Kuchipudi, if she confined herself to the dance form,” says Battina Ranga Vikram Kumar of Natraj Music and Dance Academy (NMDA).

“She had declined offers from the noted director K. Viswanath to join films though he had assured her of giving roles as a dancer. In 2013, VMDA had honoured her at Kalabharathi. She was taken in a horse cart from Maddilapalem junction to Kalabharathi and carried in a palanquin into the auditorium. She was honoured with the title 'Navarasa Natya Kalanidhi. She used to either participate or attend as a guest at dance and cultural programmes in Visakhapatnam city almost every year'” recalls Mr. Vikram Kumar.

Shoba Naidu and another noted Kuchipudi guru Bala Kondala Rao of Visakhapatnam, were roommates in Chennai, when they trained under guru Vempati China Satyam.

She was a perfectionist and never compromised on the art form. Though she was born in Anakapalle, she and her family moved from here. She grew up in Chennai under the tutelage of Vempati China Satyam in his gurukulam.

The Communist Party of India(Marxist) district committee has said that the authorities concerned should immediately go to the rescue of people of rural and tribal areas of the district, which were battered by heavy rains during the last few days.

District committee secretary K. Lokanadham said that Sarada, the Varaha and the Thandava rivers were getting heavy inflows with streams and other water bodies overflowing due to the downpour as a result of the deep depression in the Bay of Bengal.

The construction of the bridge on the Sarada River was stopped halfway and the lifting of the two gates of the Raiwada reservoir led to the inundation of the pathway to the Agency villages, preventing the movement of people to the Agency mandals.

The villagers were unable to get their stocks of essential commodities. Mr. Lokanadham demanded that the officials identify the affected areas and shift the affected people to safer place and provide them food and accommodation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/sh0u96/article32848651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14-VZ-TREES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/rescue-people-in-rural-tribal-villages-cpim-urges-officials/article32848652.ece

422,2020/10/14,Only a few cinemas in Visakhapatnam likely to reopen from October 15,"Non-availability of big banners and new films seems to be the main reason

Though the State government has given the green signal to cinema exhibitors to screen films from October 15, not many exhibitors in the city are in a hurry to reopen their theatres.

The non-availability of big banners and new films seems to be the main reason as hardly any new films had been made during the last six months in view of the pandemic situation. The few films, which were made, were released on Over the Top (OTT) platforms.

Most exhibitors feel that screening old films would not draw audiences to the cinemas after the long shutdown.

They are also bothered about the lack of permission to exhibitors in Telangana for the screening of films. The film makers would like to release new films in both the Telugu States simultaneously. “It is highly unlikely that they will give us (exhibitors in Andhra Pradesh) new content now. We have submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister seeking reduction in power tariff,” said an exhibitor.

Jagadamba theatre proprietor Jagadish Kumar plans to screen the English film ‘Viking’ from October 16. He, however, has not made any plans to screen films at his other two theatres in the complex. October 15 is Amavasya, which is considered inauspicious by some exhibitors.

“We will start screening after the Telangana government gives its nod for screening of films in that State. We hope that it happens before the Dasara festival,” says Vamsi Kishore, who owns three theatres at Gajuwaka.

Sangam and Sarat theatre are unlikely to reopen till new films are ready. “We will not open until new films are released,” says Prasad Reddy, manager of Sarat theatre.

It’s learnt that CMR and Varun INOX theatres are scheduled to open on October 15.

Meanwhile, Kalabharathi Auditorium, which has remained closed due to COVID-19 since March 22, 2020, will be reopened from October 18.

Harikatha Bhagavatarini Kalla Nirmala of Vizianagaram will render ‘Sri Sitarama Kalyanam’ Harikatha on the opening day.

She will be supported by P. Dakshina Murthy (Vijayawada) on the violin and Sivasankar (Vizianagaram) on the mridangam.

Kalabharathi secretary Rambabu says, “Wearing masks and sanitisation of hands before entering the auditorium is compulsory to check possible spread of the coronavirus.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/wl73z0/article32848499.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14-VZ-CINEMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/only-a-few-cinemas-in-city-likely-to-reopen-from-october-15/article32848500.ece

A trio of space travelers has launched successfully to the International Space Station, for the first time using a fast-track maneuver to reach the orbiting outpost in just three hours.

NASA’s Kate Rubins and Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov of the Russian space agency Roscosmos lifted off as scheduled Wednesday morning from the Russia-leased Baikonur space launch facility in Kazakhstan for a six-month stint on the station.

For the first time, they are trying a two-orbit, three-hour approach to the orbiting outpost. Previously it took twice as long for the crews to reach the station.

The trio will join the station’s NASA commander, Chris Cassidy, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, who have been aboard the complex since April and are scheduled to return to Earth a week later.

Speaking during Tuesday’s pre-launch news conference at Baikonur, Mr. Rubins emphasised that the crew spent weeks in quarantine at the Star City training facility outside Moscow and then on Baikonur to avoid any threat from the coronavirus.

""We spent two weeks at Star City and then 17 days at Baikonur in a very strict quarantine,” Rubins said. “During all communications with crew members we were wearing masks. We made PCR tests twice and we also made three times antigen fast tests.”

She said she was looking forward to scientific experiments planned for the mission. “We’re planning to try some really interesting things like bio-printing tissues and growing cells in space and, of course, continuing our work on sequencing DNA,” Mr. Rubins said",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/wc8yph/article32850971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDISS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/russian-us-astronauts-launch-to-international-space-station/article32850972.ece
424,2020/10/14,Life-sized statues of loved ones help tide over grief and loss in TN,"Sculptors in Tamil Nadu are busy catering to a surge of requests from people wanting to enshrine their loved ones

When Karnataka businessman Shrinivas Gupta installed a wax statue of his departed wife at a housewarming ceremony held in August, in his hometown of Koppal, little did he imagine that his endeavour would spark a spurt in demand for similar statues in faraway Madurai.

Shrinivas had employed the service of a Bengaluru-based sculptor for the statue that went viral on social media.

When Madurai-based entrepreneur C Sethuraman wished to fill the void in his life following the passing of his wife Pichaimaniammal, he contacted the same sculptor, inspired by Shrinivas’ viral story, only for his request to be turned down. This, however, worked in favour of JET Prasanna, a graduate of the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai, who took up the job of creating a six feet tall statue and delivering it within a fortnight, in time for the 30th day ritual Sethuraman had organised for his late wife.

Prasanna used fibre, glass and rubber to make the statue, which was also shared widely on social media. Says Prasanna, “People now call me and share how much they miss their dear ones and express confidence in me to make a statue in their likeness,” adding, “I took an order from a man in Kalpakkam who lost his wife to COVID-19 in August. Whenever he calls me, he breaks down over phone and says that he can’t wait for his wife to return home.”

Statues for all

Prasanna is now besieged by similar orders. For instance, a girl whose wedding is scheduled for November 18 wants a statue of her father made so that she can feel his presence during the ceremony. An NRI customer wants life size statues of his parents sculpted whilst another customer from Uthangudi, near Madurai, wants one of his wife sculpted to fit in the car seat, so that he can also ‘travel’ with the statue without missing her presence. “I am working on four orders at the moment,” he says.

Prasanna requires upto 12 days to finish a statue. To create the lookalikes, he uses silicon variants and fibre. “Silicon is best to recreate the eyes, nose, cheeks and the finer lines on the face,” he says. His statues cost upwards of ₹2.5 lakh.

Earlier this month, Prasanna delivered a four-feet tall statue of a woman who died aged 101 last year. The order was placed by her son, Muthu Meenakshi Sundaram, a retired bank employee. “My mother now has a permanent place in the puja room of our ancestral house in Goripalayam,” says Muthu.

Another person who has immortalised their parent in a similar manner is Thambi Balan. His father Kannu Servai lived to be 96, but for Thambi, making a statue was his way of commemmorating a man who single-handedly supported his family of nine children with his income as an agri worker. “It feels like my father is back; he sits in the main hall in his favourite corner and guards over us,” says Thambi.

Statues have always been popular in Tamil Nadu, a State where these structures hold a position of cultural significance considering the number of political leaders and figures of the past, including actors, who have been immortalised this way.

“Sculptures are luxury products. These are often used as status symbols by the rich and famous,” says ‘Stone’ Pandi, a Madurai-based sculptor for whom sculpting has been the family trade for over five generations.

He exports at least one statue every two months to his clients in the US, Germany, France, Malaysia and Singapore. Based on request, Pandi moulds his statue using granite, teakwood, mixed metal and fibre. Each sculpture costs in the ₹1-10 lakh bracket. Pandi adds that he does not use silicon because it has a shorter shelf life and requires high maintenance.

Unique request

One of his recent orders was from Madurai-based AIADMK party member, Suresh Kumar aka Kremmer Suresh. “He gave me an old, faded black-and-white photo of his mother with his brother and himself. He wanted to recreate a childhood memory as a statue. I took it up as a challenge and made a statue of the mother holding the older son by hand, and carrying the younger son on her hip,” says Pandi.

Whilst there is a surge in people wanting to immortalise their departed ones, there are also people like A Nallathambi, a 60-year-old rag picker, who poured his life’s savings into crafting a statue... of himself. Nallathambi’s likeness, which one could easily mistake for an ancient Hindu king, stands on a pedestal on the Vazhapadi-Bellur village road near Athanurpatty, Salem. The sculptor behind the statue, G Thangadurai of Okkarai, Tiruchi, says, “His request was unique and I didn’t want to disappoint him.” Nallathamabi is happy with the finished product, and has planned an unveiling ceremony soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/ttyajw/article32853590.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sculptor-Prasanna-JET-a,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/sculptors-chisel-life-size-statues-to-immortalize-the-loved-ones/article32853596.ece
425,2020/10/14,Homes include more green spaces and WFH corners in a COVID-19 world,"From green spaces to functional private WFH corners, homes in a COVID-19 world are focussing more on comfort than drastic architectural changes. Architects weigh in

Every morning, a tug of war ensues: A couple — both IT professionals with varied responsibilities and shift timings — is trying to navigate the seemingly endless tunnel that is work from home (WFH). To complicate matters, they have to share a single room.

As more people start working remotely, members of the family are scrounging for private corners inside homes to work undisturbed. And, with people spending more time indoors, there seems to be a need for homes to evolve. But, do architects feel the same? While some believe that there is an evident change in the design language of the COVID-19 world, many feel that the shift will be much gradual than we think.

Everything from having a well-lit, airy room to placing a potted indoor plant for company, the ‘little things’ now matter. A lot of these small yet notable changes are directly affecting people’s productivity as well.

At work or home?

Apart from aesthetics, functionality seems to be of prime concern today. People are forced to spend more time than ever before inside their homes: products and designs that are multi-functional are hence sought-after, says Stuti Gawri, interior designer and CEO of The Greyy Room, a design firm based in Delhi.

She has had clients who redesigned their houses during lockdown. “I think there is a major shift. Designers in today’s world are trying to solve issues that are very specific to the times. In terms of space, products, material, sustainability and multi-functionality, there has been a massive change in peoples’ perspective,” she says.

There is more of an emphasis on individual privacy now that offices have moved into homes. Small changes, like signage that demarcate one’s space (even if that means changing the carpet colour of that particular area) help, says Stuti.

Her firm recently introduced a series of portable work pods, called the Greyy Pods, equipped with partitions to give a sense of working inside a private cubicle, with features including Bluetooth, wireless phone chargers, customizable coloured fabric and lumbar support. This product comes in handy for those who share a single room and require their private working environment. Similiarly, Hyderabad-based Leesha Fabritech has introduced portable home office pods, that are customisable and can be placed inside apartment complexes or houses. However, there seems to be more interest in partitioning existing balconies with glass doors and the like, than setting up separate pods.

Some tips and tricks Family time : In the recreation room, position the TV at a central point, as the entire family can gather around. Introduce a central table, flanked by furniture that face each other.

: In the recreation room, position the TV at a central point, as the entire family can gather around. Introduce a central table, flanked by furniture that face each other. Make space for corners : In crowded spaces, furniture can be pushed against the walls to create more space to do indoor exercises, or set up recreational corners.

Invest in an ergonomic chair and multi-purpose desk. Considering hanging a colourful piece of art.

Creative dividers : Stack a pile of books as a separation between your work area and the rest of the room.

Despite this focus on privacy, the lack of social interaction also needs to be addressed. To tackle this, Thiruvananthapuram-based architect Jayakrishnan RJ proposes the mushrooming of limited community spaces. He firmly believes in today’s “cooped-up at home” scenario, people are looking for limited social interaction; with precautions in place. He suggests small community spaces within residential colonies and common intersections where people can walk to set up makeshift workspaces. A proposal for this, anchored by Institute of Indian Interior Designers’ Kerala chapter, has been considered by the Government of Kerala.

“In this case, people can avoid travel and be near their homes. Professionals are increasingly trying to escape from their homes, and still want privacy,” says Jayakrishnan.

He gives an example: within society and apartment complexes, a stand-alone module with a good master connectivity and work per hour schedules. In case of a residential colony, this space can be located at a midpoint accessible to all. “More than work-from-home, work-near-home seems to be the future,” he says.

Bring the outdoors in

“Recently, a client we met said she wants to ‘enjoy’ her house,” says Stuti adding that her client wanted to open up her living room as a multi-purpose space for entertainment. “People are actively asking for changes based on what they like, because they want to make sure they use that space.” The onus here is on their own enjoyment since the day is spent mostly indoors.

Another positive change that architects hope will not wane is the growing interest towards green and open spaces in homes. Jayakrishnan adds, “I have been observing the sales pattern of potted plants and garden accessories and it is growing like never before.” A plant instantly freshens the mood of a room or indoor space.

Bengaluru-based architect Leena Kumar, who is also part of Institute of Indian Interior Designers (IIID)’s, Bengaluru chapter, adds, “In the past, people preferred to enclose outdoor spaces because they saw ‘space’ to be more worthy inside. That will definitely change... In a small space, it is necessary to bring the outside in.” Just to be able to stand on a balcony and breathe fresh air is being appreciated now.

Finding comfort at home has been the takeaway from the pandemic, more than seeking drastic architectural changes. “Now, instead of going to an architect, they are likely to go to a designer in order to try and make their spaces more comfortable,” says Chennai-based architect Benny Kuriakose, who was mentored by Laurie Baker (British born, Indian architect known for his designs that are energy-efficient and can maximise space). He is however cautious about prophesying lasting changes. “Transformations usually happen when the discomfort level is very high. This is when remodelling happens. The pandemic and work-from-home might not lead to such big changes,” says Benny.

As options to work remotely emerged, young families started moving to their hometowns and villages from metropolitan cities. Making small but necessary changes in these ancestral homes (which may have been built in a different time) would then happen, Benny adds. The necessary changes are practical measures like getting high-speed connectivity or installing accessible plug points.

While the need of the hour is to quickly adapt to this new lifestyle with practical, economical tweaks, in the long run, the pandemic is slowly ushering a more thoughtful, personalised and high tech, but eco-friendly, home.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/u9eihx/article32853468.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/The-Fabritech1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/should-homes-evolve-in-a-covid19-world/article32853472.ece
426,2020/10/14,"NASA’s new moonshot rules: No fighting or littering, please","NASA released a set of guidelines for its Artemis moon-landing programme, based on the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and other agreements

NASA’s new moonshot rules: No fighting and littering. And no trespassing at historic lunar landmarks like Apollo 11’s Tranquility Base.

The space agency released a set of guidelines on October 13 for its Artemis moon-landing programme, based on the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and other agreements. So far, eight countries have signed these so-called Artemis Accords.

Founding members include the U.S., Australia, Canada, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said he expects more countries to join the effort to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024.

It promises to be the largest coalition for a human spaceflight programme in history, according to Mr. Bridenstine, and is expected to pave the way for eventual Mars expeditions.

“It’s important not only to travel to the moon with our astronauts, but that we bring with us our values,” noted NASA’s acting chief for international and interagency relations, Mike Gold.

Rule No. 1: Everyone must come in peace.

Other rules: — Secrecy is banned, and all launched objects need to be identified and registered.

— All members agree to pitch in with astronaut emergencies.

— Space systems must be universal so everyone’s equipment is compatible, and scientific data must be shared.

— Historic sites must be preserved, and any resulting space junk must be properly disposed.

— Rovers and other spacecraft cannot have their missions jeopardized by others getting too close.

Violators could be asked to leave, according to Mr. Bridenstine.

The coalition can say, Look, you’re in this programme with the rest of us, but you’re not playing by the same rules, Mr. Bridenstine said.

The U.S. is the only country to put humans on the moon: 12 men from 1969 through 1972.

Russia is still on the fence. The country’s space agency chief, Dmitry Rogozin, said at an International Astronautical Congress virtual meeting on Monday that the Artemis programme is U.S.-centric and he would prefer a model of cooperation akin to the International Space Station.

China, meanwhile, is out altogether.
