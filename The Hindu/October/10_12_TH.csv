0,2020/10/12,NBA Finals | Lakers equal Celtics’ record of 17 crowns,"Finals’ MVP James wins his fourth title with a third team

Los Angeles Lakers, fuelled by superstar LeBron James’ triple-double, dominated Miami Heat 106-93 on Sunday to win its 17th NBA championship. It’s first in a decade pulled Lakers level with the Boston Celtics for the most number of crowns.

James added another chapter to an epic career, delivering 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists as he captured his fourth NBA title with a third team.

He earned NBA Finals Most Valuable Player honours for a fourth time, and said the accomplishment had a special flavour with the Lakers.

First for Davis

Anthony Davis, playing in his first title series after years of frustration in New Orleans, added 19 points and 15 rebounds as the Lakers completed a 4-2 triumph more than eight months after the helicopter crash that killed team legend Kobe Bryant, who had led the Lakers to their last title in 2010.

The Lakers out-hustled, out-muscled and out-played Miami, making sure it wouldn't come down to any last-gasp effort as it did when Los Angeles were denied in game five on Friday.

The Lakers had taken hold of Game 6 by half-time, their 36 second-quarter points equalling Heat's entire first half total.

The Lakers took a 64-36 lead into the break with four players already scoring in double figures.

Heat, which had stunned the Lakers on Friday on the back of Jimmy Butler's gritty triple-double, couldn't produce another miracle.

No answer

Bam Adebayo led Heat with 25 points and 10 rebounds and Butler and Jae Crowder added 12 apiece, but Miami simply had no answer for the knockout blow Los Angeles delivered in the first half.

James played his 260th playoff game, surpassing Derek Fisher for the most all time. James said one of the great satisfactions of the victory was helping Davis gain a title.

The result (Game 6):

LA Lakers 106 (James 28) bt Miami Heat 93 (Adebayo 25). Lakers win 4-2.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/fuqxjy/article32836980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13NBA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nba-finals-lakers-equal-celtics-record-of-17-crowns/article32836981.ece
1,2020/10/12,"CIB Egyptian Open | Back in action after 6 months, Ghosal and Chinappa make winning start","Ghosal and Chinappa next play on Oct. 13

India’s leading squash players Saurav Ghosal and Joshna Chinappa tasted success in their first competitive outing in six months, comprehensively winning their opening matches at the CIB Egyptian Open here.

Ghosal and Chinappa were in Kolkata and Chennai respectively when the nationwide lockdown was enforced in March to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

World number 13 Ghosal beat 34th-ranked Englishman, Tom Richards, 11-9, 11-4, 11-1 in a second round match.

World number 11 Chinappa dropped the first game against Scotland’s Lisa Aitken before finding her rhythm for a 7-11, 11-4, 11-3, 11-6 win.

Both Ghosal and Chinappa had got a bye in the first round. They next play on Tuesday.

“It was good to be back playing again. My basic game was ok, but I was not sharp enough and I was opening the court when I was going short, and he took full advantage of it,” Ghosal told the tournament website. “I was still a few points ahead, so it gave me a bit of a mental cushion as he always had to catch up. From the second on, I was more incisive, my length got better and he couldn’t fire as much as he wanted”.

Due to limited travel connectivity from India amid the pandemic, Ghosal would be staying back in Egypt ahead of the Qatar Classic beginning November 1. Chinappa would head back home after her Egyptian Open campaign.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/cu0d1d/article27051719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07GHOS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/cib-egyptian-open-back-in-action-after-6-months-ghosal-and-chinappa-make-winning-start/article32834342.ece
2,2020/10/12,Current world champions will not get automatic invitations to World Tour Final: BWF,"According to the BWF rules, world champions enjoyed a direct qualification to the World Tour Finals

India ace P.V. Sindhu will not get a direct entry in the rescheduled World Tour Final as the Badminton World Federation (BWF) has decided against handing automatic invitations to current world champions in the season-ending tournament.

According to the BWF rules, world champions have always enjoyed a direct qualification to the World Tour Finals but with the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting the international calender, the world body has decided to do away with the criteria this year.

“Players will qualify for the HSBC BWF World Tour Finals 2020 in Bangkok (Thailand) according to current regulations. The exception to that is current world champions will not get an automatic invitation (World Tour Regulations, Clause 8.2.3) and only points earned from World Tour tournaments will be taken into account,” BWF said in a statement on Sunday.

“The remaining Grade 2 tournaments counting towards qualification are: DANISA Denmark Open 2020 (HSBC BWF World Tour Super 750), Asia Open I 2020 (HSBC BWF World Tour Super 1000), Asia Open II 2020 (HSBC BWF World Tour Super 1000).”

Sindhu, who won the World Championship gold medal last year, had pulled out of the Denmark Open and will now have to perform at the Asia legs to make it to the World Tour Finals.

“We don’t regret the decision to pull out of Denmark Open. Now that the BWF has laid down the criteria, Sindhu will try to do well in the Asia leg if there are no more postponements and qualify,” Sindhu’s father P.V. Ramana told PTI.

“She is a World Champion and has won the World Tour Final title in the past, so our main target is the All England and Olympics.”

The Denmark Open Super 750 event, beginning on Tuesday is the only World Tour tournament to be held this year.

Owing to the global health crisis, the world body was forced to move the World Tour Finals (Jan 27-31) and the two Asia opens (Jan 12-17 and Jan 19-24) to Bangkok in January next year.

The BWF also said “players do not have to participate in both the European and Asian legs to qualify for the HSBC BWF World Tour Finals 2020”.

“However, players must be entered in both Asia Open I 2020 and Asia Open II 2020 to qualify for the season finale.

“The players must arrive in Thailand at the required date/time (to be advised) ahead of the start of Asia Open I 2020. It is not possible for players to arrive later (e.g. during either Asia Open I 2020 or Asia Open II 2020) due to safety and quarantine requirements,” it said.

Providing further updates on the World Rankings system, the apex body said: “World Ranking points will be awarded for tournaments played in 2020, including: DANISA Denmark Open 2020, SaarLorLux Open 2020, Grade 3 tournaments including the following which have already taken place: YONEX Latvia International 2020, FZ FORZA Bulgarian International Championship 2020”.

“The points, however, will only be applied once the World Rankings are unfrozen. The final process and timing of unfreezing are to be confirmed.”

Last March, BWF had frozen the world rankings, saying standings as on March 17 will be the basis for entry and seedings when it restarts the international calender.

“The draws and seeding for the remainder of the 2020 season will be based on the frozen World Rankings (17 March 2020). This will apply to remaining Grade 3 tournaments of this year, and the Asian leg of the HSBC BWF World Tour 2020 in January 2021,” BWF said.

“The originally planned ‘Tentative World Rankings’ will no longer apply, due to the changes to the 2020 tournament programme (postponement of the TOTAL BWF Thomas & Uber Cup Finals 2020, cancellation of the Denmark Masters and moving of the Asian leg to January 2021.)”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/irfnzv/article32546384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08SINDHU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/current-world-champions-will-not-get-automatic-invitations-to-world-tour-final-bwf/article32832718.ece
3,2020/10/12,It means a lot to share this number with Roger: Nadal,"Nadal says he’s happy to pull level with Federer on 20 Slams

Rafael Nadal’s 13th French Open was hailed as “one of sport’s greatest achievements” by close friend and rival Roger Federer, but for the chasing pack of players, it was another dagger in their hearts.

Nadal, who has now gone level with Federer on 20 Grand Slams, has won six since turning 30. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic has won five of his 17 since leaving his 20s while Federer, now 39, claimed four after his 30th birthday.

Huge gap

The numbers illustrate how big the gap remains between the Big Three and the rest.

Nadal’s 6-0, 6-2, 7-5 win over Djokovic in the Roland Garros final allowed him to join the Serb in winning Majors in three different decades.

The 34-year-old Spaniard insisted that he won’t become obsessed with ending his career as the all-time highest Slam winner.

“I would love to finish my career being the player with more Grand Slams,” he said after winning his 100th match at Roland Garros against just two losses in 15 years.

Practical

“But I’m not going to be thinking all the time Novak has this one, Roger is winning the other one. You can't be always unhappy because your neighbour has a bigger house than you, a bigger boat or a better phone.

“In terms of these records, of course I care. For me, it means a lot to share this number with Roger. But let’s see what happens when we finish our careers. We will keep playing. I don’t know what will happen in the future.”

Despite his loss on Sunday which cost him the chance to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all the four Majors twice, Djokovic believes the 20-Slam mark can be bettered.

“If I thought it was too late, I would have ended my career today,” Djokovic told the Serbian media after his seventh loss in eight meetings with Nadal in Paris. “Myself, Nadal, Federer have been written off many times but we keep coming back and proving that we are still the best in the world.

“My goals remain the same — the historic number one ranking and Grand Slam titles,” said Djokovic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ui6t2m/article32837464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13NADAL1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/it-means-a-lot-to-share-this-number-with-roger-nadal/article32837465.ece
4,2020/10/12,Press Play: Some podcasts that discuss gaming,"Gaming was mostly a pastime when this millennium began. It still is. But it’s also a burgeoning market now, involving billions of dollars. Esports is being seriously considered for the Olympics as we speak. The viewership and prize money of esports in some cases is already higher than physical sporting events. So, this week, we are looking at podcasts that discuss games.

Game Scoop!

If you are looking for a 360-degree view of the world of gaming, then, this is the podcast for you. It tracks the latest developments from all spheres of gaming -- PS5, Xbox One, PC, phone and others. The podcast is hosted by a bunch of IGN staff. Episodes usually feature debates and discussions about the ongoing trends or the latest consoles. Apart from offering the latest news, the hosts also have fun segments like retro throwbacks that take you back to the world of Super Mario and Contra.

Episode length: 60-plus minutes (on average) Available on: Google podcast, Apple podcast, Spotify and more.

What’s Good Games

It’s three gaming nerds discussing a topic every week. But the hosts aren’t just random gaming nerds. Andrea Rene (producer at Yahoo Esports, IGN, GameStop TV, and more), Brittney Brombacher (the creator of BlondeNerd.com) and Kristine Steimer (who has worked at IGN, PlayStation and more) cumulatively have over 30 years of experience in the gaming industry. The all-women podcast also goes against the stereotype of gaming being the stronghold of boys and men. Their latest episode features a breakdown of PS5. Don’t miss that.

Episode length: 90-plus minutes (on average) Available on: Google podcast, Apple podcast, whatsgoodgames.com and more.

Giant Bombcast

Perhaps you want not just news and the usual to-the-point discussions but sprawling conversations like you would have with your friends about gaming. Then, Giant Bombcast is what you are looking for. One episode will have an assortment of talking points -- for instance, pricing of PlayStation, Mario 3D All Stars, pro-wrestling, quarantine bathing habits, breakfast cereals and more. Trust us, it’s as whacky and informal as it seems when you are reading this. Host Brad Shoemaker and his guests make you feel like you are listening to a conversation from a Quentin Tarantino movie -- seemingly off-topic, amusing nevertheless.

Episode length: Over two hours Available on: Apple podcast, Google podcast, Spotify and more.

Spawn On Me

This podcast, hosted by industry veteran Kahlief Adams among others, aims to highlight people of colour in gaming. Even as they cover industry news, design developments, new gaming characters, they offer unique insights. For instance, in a discussion about Overwatch, they highlighted the lack of a black female character though the game includes other women of colour. The show calls for more inclusion of non-white individuals in gaming, which is becoming increasingly influential and immersive.

5,2020/10/12,"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 review: pricey, pretty... worth it?","The latest unfoldable device from Samsung has a lot to offer, most noticeably its larger tablet display. What else does the Galaxy Z Fold2 have going for it?

Today we will just dive right into the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2; the device does not need a flowery introduction. It is pricey, flashy and comes with a host of new features… but is it worth the hype?

A major design upgrade from its predecessor, in the Galaxy Fold, bezels are thinner, the stainless steel body is sturdier, and the front screen is larger. If you are keen to be part of the brand’s chic Mystic Bronze gang, there is a variant available.

Specifications DISPLAY: Main Screen : 7.6'' QXGA+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display (22.5:18) Infinity Flex Display (2208 x 1768), 373ppi ; Cover Screen : 6.2'' HD+ Super AMOLED Display (25:9), 2260 x 816, 386ppi

7.6'' QXGA+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display (22.5:18) Infinity Flex Display (2208 x 1768), 373ppi ; 6.2'' HD+ Super AMOLED Display (25:9), 2260 x 816, 386ppi DIMENSIONS & WEIGHT: Folded: 68.0 x 159.2 x 16.8mm (Hinge) ~ 13.8mm(Sagging), Unfolded: 128.2 x 159.2 x 6.9mm(Frame) ~ 6.0mm(Screen) ; 282g

Folded: 68.0 x 159.2 x 16.8mm (Hinge) ~ 13.8mm(Sagging), Unfolded: 128.2 x 159.2 x 6.9mm(Frame) ~ 6.0mm(Screen) ; 282g FRONT & COVER CAMERAS: 10MP Selfie Camera : F2.2, Pixel size: 1.22 micrometres, FOV: 80˚

10MP Selfie Camera : F2.2, Pixel size: 1.22 micrometres, FOV: 80˚ AP: 7nm 64-bit Octa-Core Processor (3.09 GHz + 2.40 GHz + 1.80 GHz)

7nm 64-bit Octa-Core Processor (3.09 GHz + 2.40 GHz + 1.80 GHz) BATTERY & CHARGING: 4500mAh (typical) dual battery, Fast Charging-compatible

The Galaxy Z Fold2 is not pocket-friendly, quite literally. It stands out like an awkward, long brick in a typical skinny jeans’ pocket and is a tight squeeze. Weighing 282 grams, it is certainly not on the lighter side, given most recent smartphones range between 180 to 220 grams. Those using or investing in this device will know full well the weight comes out in the double screen and the hinge mechanism.

Two-faced experiences

Speaking of the screens, the front screen may take some getting used to; after all, a 21:9 aspect ratio means this device has the tallest screen on a smartphone so far.

I would recommend the front screen for quick tasks, simple browsing, checking texts, playing music — basically things that do not require much visual fuel. Texting and emailing will be a hassle as the touch keyboard keys seem too congested for a seamless typing experience.

The front screen has a maximum of 90Hz refresh rate, which makes sense as Samsung clearly aims to prioritise the fold-out screen which has a 120Hz refresh rate. The front screen comes with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus which is pretty tough but not exactly as invincible as it has been marketed. (The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra I reviewed — which debuted the Victus — got two rather noticeable scratches pretty early on.)

The fold-out 7.6-inch Infinity-O Cover main screen has Samsung Ultra Thin Glass, which does not exactly feel tough. Its design is anchored by the Hideaway Hinge (as seen in Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip), which fits seamlessly into the device body with the CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) mechanism and enables free standing capabilities that power all new Flex mode experiences. Plus, the Hinge itself comes with modified fibre composition and adjusted fibre density on the screen, so it is bendable but not weak.

I wouldn’t use the Galaxy Z Fold2 as a productivity alternative to, say, a larger tablet or a laptop, but I was impressed by the ability to multi-task with two apps on the Cover Screen, and how I was able to move it to the Main Screen, open a third app with Split Screen, which was useful during interviews and team meetings when I wanted several things thrown up on my screen.

Given there is such a heavy multitasking focus on this device, the option of including an S-Pen for this would be appreciated. Using the camera on this device is actually a surprising treat; though it is not as elaborate a camera as the S20 Ultra, it does produce great results, particularly in video. The aspect ratio can be customised before shooting so be sure to adjust that as needed.

The Galaxy Z Fold2, with this in mind, employs sweeper technology (first introduced, once again, on the Galaxy Z Flip) within the gap between the body and hinge housing to repel dust and undesirable particles. At this point of my review, I cannot say this feature works completely, but we can point out this exists and hopes to work in the long-term to avoid gross buildup that would be difficult to clean.

Unfolded, the smartphone forays into tablet territory. The 120Hz refresh rate makes for an impressive gaming experience; I played a couple of hours of Fortnite and the display kept up with the instincts of the quick-fire battle royale game. The 4500mAh battery holds up extremely well, given I was considering the main screen to be a single display instead of a double display. Paired with the Galaxy Buds Live made the experience more immersive with improved sound latency. I was able to get about a day and a half’s worth of battery from this model.

Ultimately, the Galaxy Z Fold2 is a good bucket-list smartphone for those with deep pockets — pun intended — but it is only a matter of time before similar concepts are brought out in other brand smartphones for far less. For me, though, this device takes a lot of getting used to; I do not need multiple options on a single device. I am fairly happy with my ‘so 2019’ single screen smartphone, thank you.

The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2, available in Mystic Bronze and Mystic Black, retails for ₹1,49,999 across major retailers and e-tailers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/k83f6h/article32834117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12mp-samsung-3,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/samsung-galaxy-z-fold2-review-is-it-a-gimmick/article32834121.ece

Triller Inc, a budding competitor to popular short-video app TikTok, is in discussions with blank-check acquisition companies about a merger which would take the U.S. social media company public, according to people familiar with the matter.

The deal would come as Triller seeks to capitalise on TikTok's woes.

TikTok has sued the U.S. government to stave off a ban from U.S. app stores while deal negotiations continue.

Triller, which was launched in 2015 and only has a fraction of the 100 million users that TikTok boasts in the United States, has said it hopes that the uncertainty over its rival's future will drive more influencers and users to its platform.

Triller is working with investment bank Farvahar Partners as it negotiates a potential deal with a so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC), the sources said. A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering (IPO) to merge with a privately held company which then becomes publicly traded as a result.

Triller's SPAC negotiations are happening alongside discussions with investors about a private fund-raising round, led by investment bank UBS Group AG, in which the Los Angeles-based company is seeking to raise around $250 million, the sources said.

Triller has so far secured around $100 million in that round at a $1.25 billion valuation, according to the sources. It is deliberating whether to proceed with the private fund-raising or opt for the deal with a SPAC, one of the sources added.

The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.

Farvahar Partners and UBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

SPACs have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies this year, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds that will be raised. U.S. SPACs have raised $53.8 billion so far in 2020 through IPOs, more than the total raised in the prior seven years, according to industry tracker SPAC Research.

Triller said earlier this year it had 65 million monthly active users on its short video app, although many analytics companies have said they have not been provided enough access to independently verify Triller's figures.

Triller's celebrity users include musicians Alicia Keys, Cardi B and Eminem, and its financial backers include Kendrick Lamar and The Weeknd.

Triller is owned by media industry veteran Ryan Kavanaugh and healthcare executive Bobby Sarnevesht. Kavanaugh in 2004 founded U.S. film studio Relativity Media LLC, whose films included the award-winning The Fighter. The studio ended up filing for bankruptcy twice, in 2015 and 2018.

Sarnevesht was a partner at Bay Area Surgical Management, which lost a $37.4 million legal battle against Aetna Inc after the health insurance firm alleged in 2012 that it had been defrauded by the surgery centers operator.

Bid for Tiktok

Triller sued TikTok in July, alleging it infringed its patent for stitching together multiple music videos with a single audio track.

In August, Triller said it had partnered with investment firm Centricus Asset Management Ltd in a bid for TikTok. ByteDance, however, said it was not engaged in such discussions.

Trump last month said he had given his preliminary blessing to a deal that would give a 20% stake in TikTok to computer networking conglomerate Oracle Corp and retail giant Walmart Inc. The negotiations subsequently stalled, as ByteDance maintained it would keep an 80% stake in TikTok, rather than distribute it to its investors.

TikTok is widely popular with U.S. teenagers, though its advertising business is still nascent. Major companies, including Procter & Gamble Co, Danone and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc told Reuters last week they would keep spending on advertising with TikTok despite the uncertainty over its future.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/xntn8/article32831701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12NETTIKTOK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/tiktok-rival-triller-explores-deal-to-go-public-sources/article32831702.ece
10,2020/10/12,Sena will contest around 50 seats in Bihar: Anil Desai,"Uddhav, Aaditya among party’s 22 star campaigners

The Shiv Sena will contest around 50 seats in the Bihar Assembly polls, the party’s Rajya Sabha MP Anil Desai said on Sunday. Mr. Desai said the Sena does not have an alliance with any party and “has fielded candidates in constituencies where we have our cadre involved in public work”.

He said the Sena’s election symbol in Bihar will be a “man blowing tura” (trumpet). The Election Commission had disallowed the Sena from using its symbol ‘bow and arrow’ in Bihar due to similarity with the ‘arrow’ symbol of the JD(U).

Asked about the schedule of Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray for campaigning in Bihar, Mr. Desai said the details would be provided by the party and the CM himself.

The Sena last week released a list of 22 leaders who will campaign in Bihar. Besides Mr. Thackeray, his son and Maharashtra Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray, Subhash Desai, Sanjay Raut, Anil Desai, Vinayak Raut, Arvind Sawant, Priyanka Chaturvedi, Rahul Shewale and Krupal Tumane also figure in the list.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/rnjvws/article32832209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMANILDESAI,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/sena-will-contest-around-50-seats-in-bihar-anil-desai/article32832210.ece

13,2020/10/12,Turkey restarts hunt for Mediterranean gas,"Ankara says it will redeploy research ship

Turkey will redeploy the research ship at the centre of an energy row with Greece to the eastern Mediterranean on Monday, a decision slammed by Athens as a “direct threat to peace”.

The row over gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean saw the two NATO countries stage rival military drills in August in strategic waters between Cyprus and the Greek island of Crete.

Greece claims rights over the waters around its island of Kastellorizo but Turkey says its longer coastline makes the territory a legitimate area for its vessels to explore.

The Turkish Navy said the Oruc Reis ship will carry out activities in the region, including the south of Kastellorizo, until October 22. The vessel will be joined in the latest “seismic survey” mission by two other ships called Ataman and Cengiz Han, the message said.

14,2020/10/12,‘Climate change to blame for doubling of disasters’,"7,348 natural disasters since 2000: UN

Climate change is largely to blame for a near doubling of natural disasters in the past 20 years, the United Nations said on Monday.

The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction said 7,348 major disaster events had occurred between 2000 and 2019, claiming 1.23 lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy some $2.97 trillion.

The figure far outstrips the 4,212 major natural disasters recorded between 1980 and 1999, the UN office said in a new report entitled “The Human Cost of Disasters 2000-2019”.

The sharp increase was largely attributable to a rise in climate-related disasters, including extreme weather events like floods, drought and storms, the report said.

Extreme heat is proving especially deadly.

“We are wilfully destructive,” UNDRR chief Mami Mizutori told reporters. “That is the only conclusion one can come to when reviewing disaster events over the last 20 years.”

She accused governments of not doing enough to prevent climate hazards and called for better preparation for looming disasters.

‘Uphill battle’

“The odds are being stacked against us when we fail to act on science and early warnings to invest in prevention, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction,” she said.

The report did not touch on biological hazards and disease-related disasters like the coronavirus pandemic. But Ms. Mizutori suggested coronavirus was “the latest proof that political and business leaders are yet to tune in to the world around them”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/climate-change-to-blame-for-doubling-of-disasters/article32837772.ece
15,2020/10/12,"Anti-microbe drug can fight coronavirus, say scientists","Common drug used to treat stomach ulcers shows promise

An affordable anti-microbial drug used to treat stomach ulcers and bacterial infections has shown promise in combating the coronavirus in animals, scientists in Hong Kong announced Monday.

Researchers set out to explore whether metallodrugs — compounds containing metal that are more commonly used against bacteria — might also have anti-viral properties that could fight the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

Using Syrian hamsters as tests subjects, they found that one of the drugs, ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC), was “a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent”.

“RBC is able to lower the viral load in the lung of the infected hamster by tenfold,” Hong Kong University researcher Runming Wang told reporters on Monday as the team presented their study.

“Our findings demonstrate that RBC is a potential anti-viral agent for COVID-19.”

The Hong Kong scientists said RBC was a commonly available drug used against stomach ulcers with a safe and comprehensive pharmacological profile.

“It’s been used for decades so it’s pretty safe,” Mr. Wang said.

They added that their research has been published in the journal Nature Microbiology.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g6bgmb/article32837624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID-19-drugs,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/anti-microbe-drug-can-fight-coronavirus-say-scientists/article32837625.ece
16,2020/10/12,Sri Lanka in talks to secure $500 mn in Chinese loans,"Pompeo is also likely to visit Colombo later this month

On the heels of a top Chinese delegation’s visit to Sri Lanka, Colombo is negotiating a $500 million loan with Beijing, as it gears up to repay a daunting $4.5 billion of its outstanding debt next year.

The Chinese Embassy tweeted on Sunday, “a $500 million concessional loan” requested by Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Finance to a “China financial institute” is under negotiation, but yet to be finalised. This is in addition to Beijing’s $90 million grant to Sri Lanka, announced days after a Chinese delegation led by Yang Jiechi, a top foreign policy official in the Beijing administration. If sanctioned, the new loan would take Sri Lanka’s total borrowings from China this year over $1 billion, after the $500 million “urgent financial assistance” that Beijing extended to Colombo in March, to help Sri Lanka cope with the economic impact of the pandemic.

The negotiations come at a time when Sri Lanka is mulling ways to repay its mounting foreign loans. State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms Ajith Nivard Cabraal recently told media that Sri Lanka is “exploring all options”, including the $1 billion currency agreement with India — under negotiation — greater investment in the securities market, bonds, as well as a $700 million syndicated loan from China.

Debt freeze

Diplomatic sources in Colombo told The Hindu that the Sri Lankan government did not discuss a possible debt freeze in talks with China’s visiting officials, though Colombo had earlier indicated that it was considering making such a request. “The focus now is on possible investment from China, not just loans,” an official source said, a fortnight after U.S.-based credit rating agency Moody’s downgraded Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit rating by two notches, to the “very high credit risk” category.

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, during his visit to New Delhi in February, had sought a debt moratorium from India, to help Sri Lanka tackle the debt repayment schedule. The request, along with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s request for a $1 billion currency swap facility, is “being discussed at the official level”, India said, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s virtual summit with PM Rajapaksa on September 26. India sanctioned a $15 million grant for the promotion of Buddhist cultural exchanges.

Theatre of geopolitics

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka is gearing up for yet another likely “high-level visit” later this month, pointing to the heightened geopolitical interest in the strategically located island nation. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “is expected to come”, Foreign Secretary Admiral Jayanath Colombage told the Sunday Times. While the U.S. Embassy here told The Hindu “no official visit has been confirmed at this time”, sources mentioned October 27 as the likely date, around the time of the scheduled visit of Mr. Pompeo and U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper to India.

News of the visit assumes significance, coming a year after Secretary Pompeo cancelled his scheduled visit to Sri Lanka. Though the Embassy cited “scheduling conflicts” as reason last June, the development coincided with considerable resistance here, to the then proposed ‘Visiting Forces Agreement’ (VFA) with the US. The Rajapaksa administration has also opposed the Millennium Challenge Corporation Agreement — for a $480 million grant — negotiated by the former government.

Further, if Secretary Pompeo visits Sri Lanka, he would be coming weeks after attending the Australia-India-Japan-U.S. Quadrilateral (Quad) Foreign Minister’s meeting in Tokyo. Members of the Quad will be closely watching the Rajapaksa administration’s engagement with Beijing for more reasons than one. Last month, Sri Lanka ordered the termination of a $1.5-billion Japanese-funded light rail project on grounds that it is not a “cost-effective solution” for Colombo and raising “environmental” concerns. Moreover, the East Container Terminal in Colombo that India and Japan agreed to jointly develop with Sri Lanka last year, has run into trouble with workers opposing “foreign involvement” in “national assets.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ohgn9i/article32837580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-SRILANKA-CHINA-DIPLOMACY-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-in-talks-to-secure-500-mn-in-chinese-loans/article32837581.ece
17,2020/10/12,‘Pakistan action on terror funding insufficient’,"FATF affiliate highlights slow progress

Noting that Pakistan’s measures against money laundering and terror financing “are not yet sufficient to justify a re-rating”, a regional affiliate of the Financial Action Task Force on Monday retained the country on its “Enhanced Follow-up” list, according to a media report.

The development came only a few weeks ahead of the meeting of the FATF — the Paris-based global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog — to decide on Pakistan’s grey list status.

The first Follow-Up Report on Mutual Evaluation of Pakistan released by the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) underlined that the country’s progress on the 40 FATF recommendations on the effectiveness of anti-money laundering and combating financing terror (AML/CFT) system largely remained unchanged — non-compliant on four counts, partially compliant on 25 counts and largely compliant on nine recommendations, the Dawn News reported.

Pakistan has improved its full compliance on only two of the 40 FATF recommendations, the APG report noted.

Enhanced follow up

Pakistan will remain in enhanced (expedited) follow up and will continue to report back to the APG on progress to strengthen its implementation of AML/CFT measures, the APG concluded in its 12-page report.

Pakistan had requested for re-ratings on three areas declared partially compliant by the APG in October last year. The request was accepted on one count and rejected on two due to ‘insufficient’ progress to the satisfaction of international experts.

The 41-member APG in August last year had downgraded Pakistan’s status to “Enhanced Follow-up” category from “Regular Follow-up” over technical deficiencies to meet normal international financial standards by October 2018.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sha6db/article32607564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FATF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-action-on-terror-funding-insufficient/article32837555.ece
18,2020/10/12,U.S. Senate begins Barrett’s confirmation hearing,"Calling for a “respectful” but “challenging” hearing, he said, “Let’s remember the world is watching.”

The U.S. Senate kicked off a four day confirmation hearing of Trump nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, with Republican and Democratic lawmakers outlining their party positions on policy and their views on the fact that a hearing is taking place at all, this close to Election Day on November 3.

Judge Barrett, whose record of judgements and statements put her on the conservative side of the bench, was nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump on September 26 as a replacement for liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who died in September. The Court will have a 6-3 conservative-liberal split, possibly for decades, if the 48 year old Ms Barrett is confirmed.

Also read: Senate push to confirm Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick

The hearings are taking place in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 215,000 people in the U.S. At the start of the hearing, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said the room had been set up to be compliant with CDC (Centre for Disease Control) regulations.

“The COVID problem in America is real, it’s serious, it’s dangerous,” Mr Graham said — striking a markedly different note from Mr. Trump and the White House whose nomination ceremony for Judge Barrett on September 26 did not meet health safety standards and likely resulted in a number of COVID cases — including the first couple. Two Senate Judiciary Committee members had also tested positive for the coronavirus and some planned to participate in the week’s hearings virtually.

Mr Graham, who had opposed Obama-nominee Merrick Garland in 2016 earlier on in the election cycle and had said if a judicial opening occurs in the last year Mr. Trump’s term the Republicans would wait until after the election to decide on a new candidate, sought to explain his volte face in his opening remarks.

“The bottom line here is that the Senate is doing its duty constitutionally,” he said, acknowledging that it was going to be a “long, contentious week.” Mr Graham suggested his opposition to nominations in the final year of a Presidency only applied when the President and Senate majorities were from different political parties.

Calling for a “respectful” but “challenging” hearing, he said, “Let’s remember the world is watching.”

Ranking Member (Democrat) Dainne Feinstein said Democrats too hoped to have a “very good hearing.” In her opening remarks she said the Democrats would focus on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), an Obama-era healthcare policy establishing universal coverage, which the Trump administration is trying to overturn in Court. The Supreme Court will hear the case in November.

“Most importantly, healthcare coverage for millions of Americans is at stake with this nomination,” Ms Feinstein said. She also referred to Judge Barrett’s criticism an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, who had sided with the liberal judges in, thus far, upholding the ACA.

Democrats had tried to stop the confirmation which they say should take place after the elections. They are also likely to use the confirmation to show case the potential damage (as per the Democrats) Judge Barrett , if she becomes Justice Barrett, could do in areas such as healthcare, abortion rights and immigration.

Vice Presidential nominee Kamala Harris — who became known for her prosecutorial style of questioning during the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings — will be carefully watched over this week. However, her situation is different now than it was in 2018: Ms Harris is a potential Vice President and eventually a possible Presidential candidate. The expectation is her role in the hearing will reflect her need to cater to progressives as well as moderates and disillusioned Republicans whose support Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden is seeking.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vigcv8/article32837365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BARRETT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-senate-begins-contentious-judicial-confirmation/article32837366.ece

China’s Qingdao city has launched a citywide nucleic acid test campaign that will cover its nine million residents over the next five days, amid apprehensions of a second wave after the coastal city reported 12 COVID-19 cases.

The cases were connected to Qingdao Chest Hospital which is a designated medical institution for the COVID-19 patients from overseas.

In May, China tested 11 million people in Wuhan - the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Qingdao health authority has said that a citywide testing program has been launched. The five districts - home to about six million people - will be fully covered in the next three days.

The whole city will be tested within five days, covering roughly nine million people, state-run Global Times reported.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Special Assistant on Information and Broadcasting Lt. Gen. (retd.) Asim Saleem Bajwa resigned on Monday, amid allegations that he used his offices to help family set up several off-shore businesses.

“I requested the honourable prime minister to relinquish me from the additional portfolio of SAPM on Info & broadcasting. He very kindly approved my request,” Mr. Bajwa, the former Pakistan Army spokesman who also served as Commander of the Southern Command, tweeted.

However, he would continue working as chairman of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority, Dawn newspaper reported.

The development comes more than a month after Mr. Bajwa submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Khan following a report on a website that alleged that he had used his offices in setting up off-shore businesses of his wife, sons and brothers.

However, Mr. Khan rejected his resignation at the time and asked him to continue working as his special assistant.

The report alleged that Mr. Bajwa’s younger brothers opened their first Papa John’s pizza restaurant in 2002, the year he started working as a Lieutenant Colonel on the General Pervez Musharraf’s staff.

It claimed that his brother Nadeem Bajwa, 53, who started as a delivery driver for the pizza restaurant franchise, another three brothers, his wife Farrukh Zeba and three sons now own a business empire which set up 99 companies in four countries, including a pizza franchise with 133 restaurants worth an estimated $39.9 million.

Out of the total 99 firms, 66 are main companies, 33 are branch companies of some of the main companies while five firms are dead now.

The Bajwa family’s companies spent an estimated $52.2 million to develop their businesses and $14.5 million to purchase properties in the United States, according to the website report.

His wife was a shareholder in all the foreign businesses and also associated with or is a shareholder in 85 companies including 82 foreign companies (71 in United States, seven in UAE and four in Canada).

The report showed that some of these American companies (all jointly owned by Ms. Zeba) also have investments in the real estate sector and own 13 commercial properties in the U.S., including two shopping centres.

22,2020/10/12,Fauci says Trump campaign ad twists his words on virus,"Dr. Fauci said, “The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.”

U.S. top government scientist Anthony Fauci said Sunday that an advertisement aired by Donald Trump's reelection campaign was edited to make him seem to endorse the President's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

“In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,” Dr. Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said in a statement sent to AFP.

The 30-second campaign ad cites Trump's personal experience with the virus — “President Trump is recovering from the coronavirus, and so is America,” it says — before including a brief clip in which Fauci appears to praise the president's response to the pandemic.

“I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more,” Dr. Fauci is shown as saying, creating the clear impression he is referring to Trump.

But a complete clip of Dr. Fauci's comments, made during an interview in March with Fox News, shows the doctor saying: “I have been devoting almost full time on this. I'm down at the White House virtually every day with the task force. It's every single day. So, I can't imagine that under any circumstances that anybody could be doing more.”

In his statement Sunday, Dr. Fauci said, “The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.”

Trump defended the clip, and his handling of pandemic, and rebutted the doctor's criticism. “They are indeed Dr. Fauci's own words. We have done a 'phenomenal' job, according to certain governors,” the President wrote in a tweet.

As a leading member of the White House task force on the coronavirus, the 79-year-old doctor has frequently had to walk a fine line in attempting to clarify — or correct — the President's often incautious assertions about the disease or the treatments and vaccines being developed against Covid-19.

Fauci has at times aroused Trump's ire, as when the President in April retweeted a message containing the hashtag #FireFauci — before publicly insisting the doctor was doing a great job.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/av7jw3/article32832475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0008QJ9YJ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fauci-says-trump-campaign-ad-twists-his-words-on-virus/article32832476.ece
23,2020/10/12,Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam delays policy address until Beijing visit,"Ms. Lam’s announcement comes just two days before her policy address was scheduled to take place

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Monday that her annual policy address scheduled for this week will be delayed until she travels to Beijing to ask the Chinese central government for help with measures to help her city’s battered economy.

Ms. Lam’s announcement comes just two days before her policy address was scheduled to take place, and amid reports that Chinese President Xi Jinping would be travelling to the Chinese southern coastal city of Shenzhen to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the special economic zone.

The leader of Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, typically gives a policy address at the start of each legislative year, but Lam said that this is a convention that is not cast in stone.

She said she is postponing the address after submitting several proposed measures to Beijing seeking their support to help boost Hong Kong’s economy, which has taken a battering due to the coronavirus pandemic and months of anti-government protests last year.

Ms. Lam said at a news conference that she will travel to Beijing at the end of October to participate in meetings with various ministries and commissions and see if the central authorities will support the proposed measures. She declined to give details on the proposals.

She added that gaining the support from the central authorities in Beijing would allow her to give an address later in the year that will boost the confidence of the city’s economic revival.

“For our economy to revive, we need the support of the mainland. We have to better integrate into the national development plan,” she said.

The supporting policies of central authorities would go a long way to boosting the confidence in our economy as well as the revival of economic activity in Hong Kong, she added.

Ms. Lam, who will also travel to Shenzhen with a delegation of Ministers from Hong Kong later on Monday to take part in the commemoration activities, said she has no scheduled meetings with Mr. Xi in Shenzhen. Local media speculated earlier that Lam was postponing her policy address because of Mr. Xi’s visit to the Chinese city.

A black man who was led by a rope by two white officers on horseback has sued a southeast Texas city and its police department for $1 million, saying he suffered humiliation and fear during his arrest.

A lawsuit filed last week in Galveston County district court on behalf of Donald Neely, 44, alleged the officers’ conduct was “extreme and outrageous”, both physically injuring Mr. Neely and causing him emotional distress, news outlets reported, citing the court documents.

Photos of the August 2019 encounter showed Mr. Neely being led by the officers on a rope linked to handcuffs — reminiscent of pictures showing slaves in chains.

Mr. Neely, who was homeless at the time, was sleeping on a sidewalk when he was arrested for criminal trespass and led around the block to a mounted patrol staging area. In body-camera video, one officer could be heard twice saying that leading Mr. Neely by rope down city streets would look “bad”.

The lawsuit accused the city and the department of negligence, and stated that the officers should have known Mr. Neely would consider it offensive to be led on the rope “as though he was a slave.”

“Neely felt as though he was put on display as slaves once were,” the lawsuit stated.

In a statement at the time, Police Chief Vernon Hale called the tactic a “trained technique and best practice in some scenarios”. However, he said he believed his officers “showed poor judgment,” adding that the department since changed its policy to prevent use of the technique.

A Texas Rangers investigation determined the officers didn’t break the law. Mr. Neely’s criminal trespass charge was dismissed in court. His lawsuit also alleges malicious prosecution connected to the charge.

City officials declined to comment on the lawsuit to news outlets.

25,2020/10/12,"Microsoft to expand its work from home policy, make it permanent for some staff","Microsoft will allow employees to work from home freely for less than 50% of their working week, and managers will be able to approve permanent remote work.

Seattle-based technology giant Microsoft has decided to expand its work-from-home policy and make it permanent for some workers.

The company has released the new “hybrid workplace” guidance that lays out how employees can have a more flexible remote work schedule and even relocate elsewhere in the country, while it continues to adjust to changing needs during the ongoing pandemic.

Microsoft will allow employees to work from home freely for less than 50% of their working week, and managers will be able to approve permanent remote work.

“We will offer as much flexibility as possible to support individual work styles, while balancing business needs, and ensuring we live our culture,” Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft’s chief people officer, said in a post on the official Microsoft Blog.

“To address this, we have provided guidance to employees to make informed decisions around scenarios that could include changes to their worksite, work location, and/or work hours once offices are open without any COVID-19 restrictions.”

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said he is focused on three major considerations of how the nature of work is changing amid the pandemic: how collaboration happens, how learning happens inside companies and how to ensure employees aren’t burning out.

The company also said that most employees’ work schedules were also flexible, meaning start and end times for workdays were no longer standard.

Employees can move across country for remote work, but compensation and benefits will vary depending on the the company’s own geopay scale. Those who move will need to cover their own relocation expenses. Microsoft will cover home office expenses for permanent remote workers.

Flexible working hours will be available without manager approval, the company stressed, adding that some roles still require access to Microsoft offices, hardware, data centres and in-person training.

“Flexibility can mean different things to each of us and we recognize there is no one-size-fits-all solution given the variety of roles, work requirements and business needs we have at Microsoft,” Hogan said.

Microsoft was one of the first companies to shift its tech workforce remotely when the coronavirus pandemic hit in March. Other tech giants such as Twitter and Zillow have said they will allow employees to work from home indefinitely.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mxlv95/article32831038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MICROSOFT-RESULTSTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/microsoft-to-expand-its-work-from-home-policy-make-it-permanent-for-some-staff/article32831039.ece
26,2020/10/12,Democrat’s praise of strict gun law roils Kansas Senate race,"An audio clip in which Democrats’ candidate is heard praising strict Australian gun laws has been released by Republicans.

Republicans circulated a video of the Democrats’ candidate for an open U.S. Senate seat in Kansas praising strict Australian gun laws that she said “took them all away” to undercut her campaign as a political moderate in what’s been an unexpectedly tough red-state race for the GOP.

Democrat Barbara Bollier’s spokesperson accused Republican Roger Marshall’s campaign of being “duplicitous” in highlighting the video.

Ms. Bollier’s campaign on Sunday released longer audio from the same event that included moments in which Ms. Bollier said she supports the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protecting gun rights and recalled hunting with her father.

Close race

The race appears to be close between Mr. Marshall, a two-term congressman for western and central Kansas, and Ms. Bollier, a Kansas City-area state senator who was a lifelong moderate Republican before switching parties late in 2018. As the GOP fights to keep its 53-47 majority in the Senate, Mr. Marshall and his supporters have attacked Ms. Bollier on issues that favour Republicans in much of the state, including gun rights.

Both a two-and-half-minute video clip provided to The Associated Press by the Marshall campaign and the longer audio from Bollier’s show that she noted that an adult daughter lives in Australia and praised a law there that in the 1990s forced owners of 700,000 guns to sell them to the government as “this amazing thing.”

“They have no guns. They don’t allow them. They just took them all away,” Ms. Bollier told her audience. “And you know what? It’s pretty darn safe.” Ms. Bollier also noted that Australia imposes licensing and training requirements for gun owners. Kansas law allows adults to carry weapons openly, and it allows them to carry concealed firearms without a permit — a policy Ms. Bollier opposed a legislator when it was enacted in 2015.

“Who thinks you can just go out and have gun? Seriously,” Ms. Bollier said. “You can’t drive a car without training. You can’t basically do anything with some kind of training. This is a lethal weapon.”

As the video clip began circulating, Ms. Bollier tweeted on Sunday afternoon: “I do not support gun confiscation. I never have. I never will.”

$32 million spent on ads

Republicans have not lost a Senate race in Kansas since 1932, but Ms. Bollier has flooded the airwaves with ads that have included testimonials from former GOP state lawmakers.

The race had seen a Kansas record of $32 million in advertising as of last week, with Mr. Marshall and his allies being outspent, according to the media advertising firm Advertising Analytics.

Ms. Bollier’s campaign had spent more than $9 million, with outside groups paying for about $8 million more. Nearly 90% of the roughly $14.5 million in ads for Mr. Marshall were covered by outside groups, with the Marshall campaign spending about $1.5 million, according to Advertising Analytics.

Ms. Bollier’s remarks on guns first were reported on Sunday by The Washington Free Beacon conservative site. Mr. Marshall’s campaign manager, Eric Pahls, texted a 36-second excerpt to The Associated Press.

He later provided a link to a longer video clip with Ms. Bollier’s full answer to a question from a woman who said she recently bought a handgun and was “completely disturbed by how easy it was for her one to buy one and carry it concealed.”

“This may sound good to Bollier’s donors in San Francisco, but to Kansans, this is disqualifying,” Mr. Pahls said in a later text. “Even among Democrats, forced gun confiscation is an alarming concept.”

‘Taken out of context’

Ms. Bollier spokesperson Alexandra De Luca provided the longer audio clip, which featured comments from the Democratic candidate a few minutes before the question that led Ms. Bollier to praise Australian gun laws.

Ms. Bollier said she still has one of her father’s shotguns but called gun violence a public health crisis.

“Roger Marshall and his allies in Washington want to take Barbara’s comments completely out of context for their political benefit,” Ms. De Luca said in a statement. “She knows we can protect the rights of gun owns and keep our communities safe.”

But Mr. Pahls suggested that Ms. Bollier’s comments in support of the Second Amendment represent “carefully scripted talking points and that with off-script answers to questions, “she exposes herself for the radical leftist that she is.”

“Her true colours started shining through,” he said.

Mr. Pahls also suggested Ms. Bollier’s staff ended the event shortly afterward because “she got off her rehearsed talking points.”

Ms. De Luca called it “an outright lie,” then provided 32 minutes of audio from the event. It showed that she began wrapping up about a minute later — after answering a final question and saying she supports background checks for gun purchases.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/j5lpz2/article32830967.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKELECTION2020SENATEKANSAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/democrats-praise-of-strict-gun-law-roils-kansas-senate-race/article32830968.ece
27,2020/10/12,Turkey to conduct seismic survey in eastern Mediterranean,"This step is likely to revive tensions with NATO ally Greece.

Turkey's navy has issued an advisory late on Sunday saying that the Turkish ship Oruc Reis will carry out a seismic survey in the eastern Mediterranean over the next ten days, a step likely to revive tensions with NATO ally Greece.

Two other vessels, the Ataman and Cengiz Han along with Oruc Reis exploration ship will continue works in an area including the south of Greek island of Kastellorizo until October 22, the maritime notice said.

The two countries are at odds over overlapping claims for hydrocarbon resources in the region. The foreign ministers of Turkey and Greece met last week and agreed to hold bilateral talks on the disputes.

Last month, Ankara withdrew Oruc Reis from contested waters to “allow for diplomacy” ahead of a European Union summit.

After the summit the bloc said it would punish Turkey if it continued its operations in the region, in a move Ankara said further strained Turkey-EU ties.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4w9h4j/article32830963.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKTURKEY-GREECEBLUEHOMELAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/turkey-to-conduct-seismic-survey-in-eastern-mediterranean/article32830961.ece
28,2020/10/12,England to have 3-tier lockdown system amid ‘tipping point’,"Under the new system, the country will be placed into “medium,” “high” and “very high” alert levels.

Millions of people in northern England are anxiously waiting to hear how much further virus restrictions will be tightened in coming days as the British government confirmed on October 11 that it will be introducing a new system for local lockdowns.

In response to the virus’ resurgence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce in Parliament on October 12 a three-tier local lockdown system, formally known as “Local COVID Alert Levels,” for England, his office said.

Under the new system, the country will be placed into “medium,” “high” and “very high” alert levels. Mr. Johnson’s office said the government is working with local leaders to decide which areas are covered by the very high alert level, and the appropriate interventions in those areas.

Details of what is involved at each level haven’t been confirmed but the highest level is widely expected to involve the closure of pubs and restaurants and the banning of household mixing, both indoors and outside, among other measures.

The new lockdown system, which is intended to simplify the process by which local restrictions are imposed, has been widely anticipated for a couple of weeks following a sharp increase in new cases. Following further discussions early Monday, Mr. Johnson will inform lawmakers of the new system before hosting a briefing along with Treasury chief Rishi Sunak and the government’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty.

England’s deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, warned that the U.K. is at a “tipping point” akin to where the country was in March.

“But we can prevent history repeating itself if we all act now,” he said. “Now we know where it is and how to tackle it - let’s grasp this opportunity and prevent history from repeating itself.”

All across Europe including the U.K., there have been huge increases in coronavirus cases over the past few weeks following the reopening of large sectors of the economy, as well as schools and universities. Infection levels — and deaths — in the U.K. are rising at their fastest rates in months.

Without quick action, there are fears that U.K. hospitals will be overwhelmed in the coming weeks at a time of year when they are already at their busiest with winter-related afflictions like the flu. The U.K. has experienced Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with an official death toll of 42,825, up another 65 on Sunday.

Although coronavirus infections are rising throughout England, northern cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle have seen a disproportionate increase. While some rural areas in eastern England have less than 20 cases per 1,00,000 people, some major metropolitan areas have recently recorded levels above 500 per 1,00,000, nearly as bad as Madrid or Brussels.

As a result, national restrictions such as a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants have been supplemented by local actions, including in some cases banning contacts between households. In Scotland’s two biggest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, pubs have already closed for 16 days to suppress the outbreak.

Liverpool’s local leader has said he expects his city to face the most onerous restrictions from Wednesday.

Local leaders across northern England have vented their fury at the Conservative government over what they see as an “inadequate” wage support scheme that it announced Friday and for not properly telling them about the upcoming restrictions. The wage plan aims to help employees in companies that are forced to close because of virus restrictions, but mayors say it’s not generous enough in paying only two-thirds of employees’ wages and doesn’t compensate those indirectly hit by any business closures, such as drink suppliers to pubs.

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick on Sunday sought to assuage concerns that the government was being overly hierarchical in its approach. He also indicated that local authorities will be given more control over the national test and trace program, which has struggled to live up to Mr. Johnson’s prediction that it would be “world-beating.”

“In addition to the national infrastructure which is developing and increasing with every passing week, we’re also going to be making use of local councils to do contact tracing in particular, because there is clear evidence that local councils are good at that, as you’d expect,” he told the BBC.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/85qq9e/article32830762.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0008RU3ND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/england-to-have-3-tier-lockdown-system-amid-tipping-point/article32830763.ece
29,2020/10/12,"French police station attacked with fireworks, metal bars","President Emmanuel Macron is to meet with police unions on October 15 to quickly find ways to protect officers

Dozens of people attacked a police station outside Paris early on October 11 with blasts of fireworks and metal bars, damaging several police cars, officials said. No one was injured.

It was the latest action among numerous attacks against police officers, and sometimes firefighters, that Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin says are a sign that France is growing “savage“.

Last week, two police officers in civilian clothes were pulled from their vehicle in a Paris suburb and shot multiple times with their own guns. One officer remains in serious condition.

President Emmanuel Macron is to meet with police unions on October 15 to quickly find ways to protect officers, the Interior Minister said on a visit Sunday night to Champigny-sur-Marne, east of Paris.

“The police are the [French] Republic and the Republic is the police,” he said. He said the attack was another sign of the “great savageness” he claims is undermining French values.

He linked the attack to a police crackdown on drug dealers and, using street language, said it was aimed at “smashing cops“.

The police station is located in a housing project with 10,000 inhabitants. An official of the union, Unite SGP Police, Rocco Contento, said on BFMTV that the housing project is the hub of drug trafficking in the Val de Marne region, where Champigny is located.

Darmanin said he wants to add an amendment to a security bill defining fireworks as a type of arm and ban their sale, including on the internet.

In the early hours of October 11, a gang of about 40 people showered the police station in a housing project in Champigny-sur-Marne with fireworks and other projectiles, Paris police headquarters, which is in charge of the region, said in a tweet. Attackers also used metal bars to smash five police cars. Three windows of the station were broken.

Fireworks are now routinely used by gangs to head off police in neighbourhoods known for drug trafficking. Firefighters on rescue missions also come under attack.

“The little bosses impress no one and don’t discourage us in our fight against drugs,” the Interior Minister tweeted earlier. There were no known arrests.

Investigators were still trying to find the three men who shot two police officers last week after pulling them from their car and disarming them in an industrial section of the town of Herblay, in the Val d’Oise northwest of Paris.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7bnbxh/article32830534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-PARIS-POLICE-FIREWORKS-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/french-police-station-attacked-with-fireworks-metal-bars/article32830535.ece
30,2020/10/12,‘FIFA 21’ review: A gaming testament to sport and spirit,"On the surface FIFA 21 may seem the same, but under the hood are small tweaks that bring the video game closer to the offline sport

Sports games that come out every year have it tough; tweaking gameplay, updating stats and rosters, and rolling out novel features, all to justify another purchase — especially after the powerhouse release last year which introduced VOLTA, EA Sports’ narrative innovation, which will permitted gamers to take football back to the streets, away from the familiar arenas of big clubs. (Volta is also Portuguese for ‘return’)

FIFA 21 Developer: EA Sports

EA Sports Publisher: EA

EA Price: ₹2,499 on Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC ; coming soon on Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X/S

That said, there seems to be a pattern, as FIFA 21 — launched globally on October 9 — seems to be an all-round improvement this year, not just in the look but in the feel.

After the hue and cry around the disappointing career mode in FIFA 20, the latest game buffs up the single-player experience. FIFA 21 plays like a management simulation, where you lay down strategies for a successful team. You seem to become a more active football manager, where you can realistically simulate a game and play out different plans in real time. However, if you want to get a bit hands on, you can jump anytime into the game and play it yourself. The abilities to trade players on the market, train your team and set your tactics are fun. Sure, it’s not the grand update we wanted, but it’s a step up from last year and a move in the right direction.

The other single-player mode comes with VOLTA, too. The other modes too, such as Ultimate Team, have got small improvements and key additions — including co-op with a friend to take on rival teams — that make the game a lot more fun. All welcome features but nothing revolutionary.

New kicks

The best user experiences are the invisible ones, and FIFA 21 has a lot going for it under the hood. There is more focus on the defensive aspects of the game, given FIFA has always been attacker-friendly. A favourite gameplay feature is Agile Dribbling, which holds down the right shoulder button and use the thumbstick to allow the player with the ball to have precise control of the ball; a skilled player can manoeuvre out of tight player dragnets on the pitch towards the goal.

Creative Runs, another great feature, allows some control on how your teammates move around you, easily positioning them for a strategic pass. EA has also added a better player AI personality, so players in the game will behave a lot like the real players, in both offence and defence verticals. Other behind-the-scenes changes include a better collision system, that aims to bring about more natural movements and interactions between players, which in previous games saw a lot of falling down and other goof ups.

It goes without saying that the game looks great, updated with all the latest rosters of your favourite matches. FIFA has shaped itself over the years as a true interactive representation of not only the sport but also its spirit: from the fans’ animation in the stands to the on-pitch emotions running wild, this release captures everything loved about the entire franchise.

As expected, EA has also included two sets of distinctly different soundtracks (from more than 100 artists from 23 different countries) for both the tournament and VOLTA modes.

If your next gen console pre-order has not been cancelled in the ensuing supply scarcity following the pandemic, then wait and play FIFA 21 on your brand new next gen console as soon as it arrives. If you skipped out on FIFA 20, it is a great reason to jump on the new game. A lot of FIFA 21’s changes prove that it is one of the best football games on the market today, and while it is short on large features, its improvements are worth its price tag.

31,2020/10/12,"India and U.S. have been too cautious on China, says U.S. official","Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun called for a fundamental alignment along shared security, geopolitical goals

India and the United States have been “too cautious”, when it comes to China’s concerns about their strategic ties, said a senior U.S. official, who called China the “Elephant in the room” during bilateral talks.

Speaking at a think-tank event during his visit to Delhi, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun said the Washington respects India’s tradition of “Strategic Autonomy”, and did not seek to pull it into a security alliance, but hoped to build a partnership in the region through the Quad (Australia-India-Japan-U.S. Quadrilateral dialogue), which he dubbed “Pax Indo-Pacifica”.

Also read: After Quad meet, China slams ‘closed and exclusive cliques’

“We have seen the conditions emerge for an organic and deeper partnership [between India and the U.S.] — not an alliance on the postwar model, but a fundamental alignment along shared security and geopolitical goals, shared interests, and shared values,” Mr. Biegun said at an “India-U.S. Forum” event in Delhi, where he shared a session with Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla.

Mr. Biegun arrived in Delhi for a two-day visit to prepare for the upcoming “2+2” talks between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Defense Secretary with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.

Also read: Quad’s significance rises as Ministers meet

Mr. Biegun said the talks will be held “later this year”, although sources indicated that the 2+2 is scheduled for October 26-27.

The arrival of senior U.S. officials including Mr. Biegun less than a month before the US presidential elections is unusual, especially given curtailed travel during the coronavirus pandemic, and the fact that Mr. Jaishankar and Mr. Pompeo just met for the Quad ministerial dialogue in Tokyo last week. However, the sources suggested that an exception for the U.S. is indicative of the close personal ties shared between the Trump administration and the Modi government. .

The ongoing standoff between Indian and Chinese troops at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is also likely to be a factor in strengthening bilateral arrangements and well as coordination in the Indo-Pacific region at this time.

“As we advance in this direction [of the stronger partnership], there is an elephant in the room: China,” Mr. Biegun said, making a specific reference to comments made by former diplomat Ashok Kantha in a recent interview to The Hindu about the need to be less “cautious” about developing the Quad and strategic linkages with the U.S.

“I could not agree more with Ambassador Kantha. We have been too cautious. Last week’s important and successful Quad ministerial leaves the United States confident that perhaps, just maybe, we can say that we are present at the creation of those strategic linkages,” Mr. Biegun added.

During the 2+2 meeting, India and the US are expected to discuss further cooperating on their Indo-Pacific strategy, talks on the fourth and last foundational agreement Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) for geospatial cooperation, as well as a number of defence deals including for armed drones and maritime patrol aircraft from the U.S.

Reacting to the Tokyo meeting and to Mr. Pompeo’s remarks that called for the Quad members to “collaborate” to counter China’s aggression at the LAC and the South China Sea, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had called the Quad a “closed and exclusive clique”.

In a direct response, Mr. Biegun said the U.S. position was that the Quad did not carry “binding obligations”, and any country seeking a “free and open Indo-Pacific” would be welcome to join.

“I should also be clear that the security partnerships the United States and our partners explore today do not necessarily need to follow the model of the last century of mutual defence treaties with a heavy in-country U.S. troop presence,” Mr. Biegun added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sz8bcw/article32837417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/StephenBiegun,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-and-us-have-been-too-cautious-on-china-says-us-official/article32837418.ece
32,2020/10/12,No penal provision to protect transgenders from assault: plea,"SC asks govt. to respond to plea to provide equal protection

The Supreme Court on Monday asked the government to respond to a plea to provide equal protection in law against sexual abuse for transgender persons.

The petition filed by advocate Reepak Kansal said there was no penal provision which protected them from sex crimes.

A Bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde said the petition embodied a worthy cause and required hearing.

The Bench also asked senior advocate Vikas Singh, who represents Mr. Kansal, to file details of instances in which the court, to protect rights, filled up the vacuum caused by the absence of statutory law.

The court referred to the Vishaka guidelines dealing with the sexual harassment of women at the workplace and the decriminalisation of consensual gay sex acts in this context.

The plea referred to the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other criminal laws which do not mention offences against “transgender, transsexuals, kinnar and eunuchs”.

“In spite of declaring transgender people to be a ‘third gender’ by this court, there is no provision/section in the Indian Penal Code which may protect the third gender from the sexual assault by male/female or another transgender,” the petition said.

The PIL challenged the constitutional validity of certain clauses of Section 354 A (outraging the modesty of woman) of the IPC, to the extent that they are interpreted to exclude victims of sexual harassment who are transgender persons.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x1c35/article32837640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-LTSUPREMECOURTOFINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-penal-provision-to-protect-transgenders-from-assault-plea/article32837641.ece
33,2020/10/12,"High Court order trivialisation of rape victim’s trauma, says plea in Supreme Court","Accused asked to meet victim on Rakshabandhan

Nine women lawyers have approached the Supreme Court against a Madhya Pradesh High Court order which directed a man accused of sexual assault to visit his victim at home on Rakshabandhan and “allow” her to tie a rakhi on him as a condition of bail.

The lawyers, led by advocate Aparna Bhat, said the High Court order was a “trivialisation of her [victim’s] trauma.”

Violates law

The law prescribes the victim to be kept far away from the accused. Instead, here the High Court has ordered the accused to visit the home of the woman — the very place where the crime is alleged to have occurred. The case is that the accused forcibly entered the victim’s house to commit the crime. The petition said the High Court further ordered the accused to gift the woman ₹11,000 “as a customary ritual usually offered by brothers to sisters on such occasion and shall also seek her blessings.”

The High Court also ordered the accused to offer ₹5000 to the woman’s son for the “purchase of clothes and sweets.”

Stay the order

The order only succeeds to victimise the woman and retards the years of work done to sensitise the courts about how damaging it would be to attempt a compromise “by way of marriage or mediation between the accused and the survivor.”

The petition urges the apex court to stay the condition for bail passed by the High Court in July.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6carul/article32765363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/high-court-order-trivialisation-of-rape-victims-trauma-says-plea-in-supreme-court/article32837466.ece
34,2020/10/12,India welcomes release of abducted citizens in Libya,"They belong to Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh

India on Monday welcomed the release of seven nationals who had been abducted in September by fighters in war-torn Libya. The Ministry of External Affairs acknowledged the support that the authorities in Tripoli have extended in ensuring the release of the seven persons belonging to Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.

“All of them are in good health and are currently staying in the company’s premises in Brega. We are trying to complete the formalities to enable their return to India,” said the Ministry about the men who were handed over to the representatives of energy company Al Shola Al Mudea. The Indians were abducted by one of the several active militias in the country on September 14 when they were on their way to the airport in capital Tripoli to catch a flight to return home.

It is learnt from local sources that they were employed by Al Shola Al Mudea.

“We convey our sincere thanks to the Libyan authorities and the tribal elders from the region for their steadfast cooperation in securing the release of our nationals unharmed. Both our Ambassador to Tunisia [Puneet Roy Kundal] and our local consular staff were in constant touch with them and the company all through the crisis,” said the MEA. The Ambassador has the additional responsibility of the mission in Tripoli as India does not have a resident ambassador in Tripoli as of now.

India imposed a ban on travelling to Libya back in 2011 and has renewed the advisory subsequently. Indian nationals are urged not to seek employment in the various energy, health and infrastructure facilities which has high demand for Indian professionals. The MEA reiterated the advisory on Monday.

Last week, the Ministry assured that South Block was “making all possible efforts in consultation and coordination with Libyan authorities and the employer to trace” the citizens. Libya has seen continuous fighting since the fall of the regime of Muammar Qadhafi in October 2011.

Advocacy uses this collective voice to defend and protect rights, or to support different initiatives or causes.

36,2020/10/12,34 Bollywood producers move Delhi High Court to restrain TV channels,"Four cine industry bodies part of plea against defamatory statements

Four Bollywood industry associations and 34 leading producers have moved the Delhi High Court seeking to restrain Republic TV, Times Now, and other social media platforms from publishing irresponsible and defamatory remarks against Bollywood as a whole.

The suit has been filed in the wake of these channels using highly derogatory words and expressions for Bollywood such as “dirt”, “filth”, “scum”, and “druggies”.

Industry veterans

The producers who moved the High Court include Dharma Productions, Aamir Khan Productions, Ad-Labs Films, Ajay Devgn Flims, Yashraj Films, Salman Khan Films, Ashutosh Gowariker Productions and Red Chillies Entertainment, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Pictures, Reliance Big Entertainment, Rohit Shetty Picturez, Vinod Chopra Films, and Kabir Khan Films.

The producers and four Bollywood industry associations — the Film & Television Producers Guild Of India (PGI), the Cine & TV Artistes’ Association (CINTAA), Indian Film and TV Producers Council (IFTPC) and Screenwriters Association (SWA) — have sought direction to the news channels to abide by the provisions of the Programme Code under the Cable Television Networks Rules.

The suit stated that Bollywood is unique and stands on a different footing from any other industry as it is an industry that is dependent almost solely on goodwill, appreciation and acceptance of its audience.

Livelihoods impacted

The livelihood of persons associated with Bollywood is being severely impacted by the smear campaign being run by the news channels and social media platforms. This is in addition to the ongoing pandemic which has resulted in extreme revenue and work opportunity loss, law firm DSK Legal said in a statement.

“The privacy of the members of Bollywood is being invaded, and their reputations are being irreparably damaged by painting the entire Bollywood as criminals, seeped in drug culture, and making being part of Bollywood synonymous with criminal acts in the public imagination,” the statement said.

The suit, however, stated that the associations and the producers are not seeking a blanket gag order against media reportage of the investigation in the cases relating to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.

It stated that the named news channels are conducting and publishing parallel private ‘investigations’ and effectively acting as “courts” to condemn persons connected with Bollywood as guilty based on what they claim is “evidence” found by them, thereby trying to make a mockery of the criminal justice system.

The statement said the producers and associations are merely seeking “perpetual and mandatory injunction against the Defendants from carrying on reportage and publication of material that violates applicable laws”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a1biv2/article32835947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOLLYWOODKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/34-bollywood-producers-move-delhi-high-court-to-restrain-tv-channels/article32835948.ece
37,2020/10/12,"Firm, promoters and directors booked by CBI in bank fraud case","They allegedly cheated the SBI of over ₹51.39 crore

The CBI has booked First Winner Textiles (India) Private Limited, its promoters and directors for allegedly cheating the SBI of over ₹51.39 crore.

Among those named in the FIR are Rinku Patodia, Anita Patodia and Dhirendra Barot. The company is part of the Patodia Group of entities promoted by Mr. Patodia and his family members.

The company was sanctioned credit facilities amounting to ₹60 crore. Upon examining certain transactions, the bank later suspected that it had allegedly been dealing with some shell entities. The company had opened accounts with three other banks, through which the funds were allegedly diverted.

Owing to irregular repayment of loans, the credit account was declared a non-performing asset (NPA) in February 2013.

The FIR said the accused had floated five other associate companies, Ramshyam Textiles Industries Private Limited, Pal Trading Company Private Limited, Starwood Exports Private Limited, Rikosh Fashion Private Limited and Solitaire Texfab & Traders Private Limited.

The six group companies availed themselves of credit facilities to the tune of ₹171.54 crore from the SBI. It is alleged that the sale proceeds were not being routed through the cash credit accounts with the lending bank.

As the borrowers failed to repay the loans, the other accounts also turned NPA in 2013.

The bank got a forensic audit done. It turned out that all the six borrowing entities were incorporated within a short span of time in 2000. They had common directors and office addresses. They traded in grey fabrics.

It is alleged that the six companies had financial transactions with 17 companies, which had common directors. The registered addresses of these 17 entities were the properties owned by the six companies. In some cases, they were held by the SBI as security against the credit facilities.

Based on the findings, the bank concluded that the 17 companies were shell entities and through them, the funds were misappropriated and diverted to the real estate companies of close relatives of the accused.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/emiejj/article32835402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CBI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/firm-promoters-and-directors-booked-by-cbi-in-bank-fraud-case/article32835403.ece
38,2020/10/12,"Respond to petitions on new agricultural laws, Supreme Court tells Centre","They are the beginning of an anti-farmer “exploitative regime”, say pleas

The Supreme Court asked the Centre to respond to petitions describing the passage of the controversial new agricultural laws by Parliament as the beginning of an anti-farmer “exploitative regime”.

Though the court said the mere passage of the laws does not give rise to a “cause of action”, questions on the laws would tend to rise in the future in courts, and hence, it would be better for the government to address these issues now.

“You may have to answer these pleas sometime or the other... You better file a reply,” Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde addressed Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, on Monday.

The court was dealing with various petitions filed by Rakesh Vaishnav, an office-bearer of the Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress, represented by advocate K. Parameswar; DMK MP Tiruchi Siva, represented by senior advocate P. Wilson; and a separate plea by advocate M.L. Sharma.

The petitions have challenged the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Agriculture and Promotion) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act of 2020.

The hearing kicked off on a sceptical note from the Bench.

The CJI, on noting that the government was represented by Mr. Venugopal flanked by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General K.M. Natraj, said it seemed an ‘overkill’ to have so many top law officers appearing for a case showing no “cause of action”.

Addressing Mr. Sharma’s petition, the CJI advised the lawyer to “go get a cause of action” and then approach the High Court concerned instead of the apex court.

“Merely passing a legislation does not permit a cause of action...We do not want to reject your case, we want you to withdraw,” Chief Justice Bobde told Mr. Sharma.

Mr. Parameswar however prevailed on the court about the necessity to take judicial notice of the laws at this stage.

“Farmers’ produce was being sold in the mandis of Chhattisgarh but this Act goes against the Constitution,” Mr. Parameswar submitted. The Bench asked the government to file its response.

Mr. Siva, through Mr. Wilson, said the laws were “prima facie unconstitutional, illegal and arbitrary” as they would “usher in a new exploitative regime for the poor farmers of the country, who are entirely dependent on earning their livelihood, by selling their produce in the market”.

The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act would facilitate black marketing. It would have black market dealers regulate the stock limit and stocking of agricultural produce, Mr. Siva’s petition said.

“Suffice it to say that the Acts attack the very foundation of the agricultural fabric of the country that was built to safeguard the interests of the farmers and not leave them at the mercy of the new era of privatisation,” the petition said.

39,2020/10/12,Nirbhay missile develops technical snag during trial,"The missile was test-fired by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) from an integrated test range in Balasore in Odisha at around 10:30 AM.

The Nirbhay subsonic cruise missile, having a range of around 1,000 km, developed a technical snag during a test firing on Monday at a facility in Odisha, forcing its developer DRDO to abort the trial, official sources said.

The missile was test-fired by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) from an integrated test range in Balasore in Odisha at around 10:30 AM.

“Minutes later, the missile developed a technical snag following which the trial process was aborted. The DRDO is analysing all the details,” said a source.

The DRDO has already carried out several successful trials of the ‘Nirbhay’ missile since October 2014.

The state-of-the-art missile, which can be deployed from multiple platforms, has a speed less than that of sound (Mach 0.8).

Powered by a solid rocket motor booster developed by the Advanced Systems Laboratory (ASL), the missile has an operational range of 1000 km, officials said.

In the last few weeks, India has test-fired a number of missiles including a new version of the surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile BrahMos and anti-radiation missile Rudram-1.

India also carried out successful test-firing of a laser-guided anti-tank missile and nuclear-capable hypersonic missile ‘Shaurya’.

The successful test firing of Rudram-1 is seen as a major milestone as it is India’s first indigenously developed anti-radiation weapon.

The flight testing of the missiles comes in the midst of India’s bitter border row with China in eastern Ladakh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oelzur/article32834747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIRBHAYKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhay-missile-develops-technical-snag-during-trial/article32834748.ece
40,2020/10/12,Was ready to quit Congress in March itself: Kushboo,"The trust that people have repeatedly shown in Prime Minister Modi is something that needs to be understood, says Kushboo

Actor and former Congress spokesperson Kushboo Sundar on Monday joined the BJP, having sent in her resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. She said she had been contemplating the action since March last.

Ms. Sundar, who lives in Chennai, joined the BJP in New Delhi in the presence of party’s State unit chief L. Murugan and national general secretary C.T. Ravi, along with two others from Tamil Nadu- journalist Madan Ravichandran and former Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer Sarvana Kumar.

“I promise to carry out any assignment given to me by the party and express faith in the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji,” she said at a press conference.

The reasons

Later, speaking to The Hindu, Ms. Sundar was more candid. She said she had spoken of the reasons for quitting the Congress in her letter to Ms. Gandhi. In it, she referred to a “few elements, seated at a higher level within the party, people who have no connectivity with the ground reality or public recognition” who were “dictating terms”. She added, “People like me, who wanted to work for the party sincerely are being pushed and suppressed.”

Ms. Sundar said, “This letter was ready way back in March, and since I had joined the Congress in the presence of Ms. Gandhi, I wanted to hand over the resignation letter in person. But the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown prevented it”.

Mentions Modi

At the time of writing the letter, she said, she was not sure that she would be joining the BJP. “As a person occupying the position of spokesperson, it was my duty to attack the policies of the government even though all Bills have certain flaws. But gradually I felt that the clarity that the BJP has, in terms of its ideology and leadership was important, instead of being in a party where the question of leadership is also in a flux. The trust that people have repeatedly shown in Prime Minister Modi is something that needs to be understood”.

On the question of how she would deal with the perception that the BJP, as a party, was not exactly considered friendly towards minorities, she replied with a one-liner, “If the BJP is anti-minority, then is Congress anti-Hindu?”

She said that she was awaiting an assignment from the State unit and did not elaborate on how she saw the future of the BJP panning out in Tamil Nadu, where the party has a miniscule presence.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/14c2yo/article32833342.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kushboo-Sundar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/was-ready-to-quit-congress-in-march-itself-kushboo/article32834379.ece

The Supreme Court on Monday advised the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) to approach the “correct court” for relief when informed that its secretary and journalist, Sidhique Kappan, has been arrested and charged with sedition.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde adjourned a habeas corpus petition filed by the KUWJ to know the whereabouts of Mr. Kappan, who was detained by the Uttar Pradesh police while en route to Hathras, where a 19-year-old Dalit girl died days after she was assaulted and allegedly raped.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for the KUWJ, submitted that “no court in Uttar Pradesh” will grant bail to Mr. Kappan. “A journalist will be in jail for six months”, Mr. Sibal said.

The CJI protested at this strain of thought from the petitioner side, saying the case could be brought before the Allahabad High Court.

Sibal’s plea

Mr. Sibal asked the court for permission to file a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution alleging violation of fundamental rights of a citizen at the hands of the State.

Mr. Sibal said Mr. Kappan’s arrest and the registration of an FIR for sedition and under the provisions of the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act came shortly after the habeas corpus petition was filed in the apex court.

The journalist was kept incognito at the time of filing the habeas corpus in the Supreme Court.

The court adjourned the case by four weeks.

The petition, filed by advocate Shweta Garg and settled by advocate Wills Mathews, had arraigned the Centre, the U.P. government, the Director General of Police of U.P. and the Delhi Police Commissioner as respondents.

“Media is the breath of democracy. The ultimate of test of democracy is freedom of speech and expression”, the petition said.

It submitted that any denial of access to journalists to the place of news affects the fundamental right of ordinary citizens to gain information.

“The government's attitude in the Hathras incident is inhuman and unethical… I want to tell the government through you, please start doing your work.

PGK Menon, who has been part of the Indian delegation during the earlier round of talks as well. A representative from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is also present in the Indian side.

Joint statement

After the 6th round of talks on September 21, both sides, for the first time, issued a joint statement in which they agreed to “stop sending more troops to the front line” and “refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground.”

However, on September 29, the Chinese foreign ministry said it “did not recognise” the UT of Ladakh and the Line of Actual Control (LAC) was “clear” and “that it is the LAC of November 7, 1959”. The MEA responded sharply to this saying, “India has never accepted the so-called unilaterally defined 1959 LAC.”

First Pakistan and now China is creating dispute on the border under a mission, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday after inaugurating 44 permanent bridges across seven States and Union Territories built by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO).

Talking of the situation along the northern and eastern borders, Mr. Singh said, “We have a border of about 7,000 km with these countries, where tension remains.” He also laid the foundation stone for the Nechiphu tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh.

Mr. Singh said these bridges provide improved connectivity in the far-flung areas of the western, northern and the northeast sectors and also meet the transport and logistics requirements of the armed forces throughout the year.

He said the annual budget of the BRO that varied from ₹3,300 crore to ₹4,600 crore in years 2008-2016, saw a substantial rise and is pegged at over ₹11,000 crore in 2020-21. He said the government has sanctioned high-altitude clothing to the BRO engineers and workers.

The bridges range from 30m to 484m and are located in J&K (10), Ladakh (8), Himachal Pradesh (2), Punjab (4), Uttarakhand (8), Arunachal Pradesh (8) and Sikkim (4). The 450m-long, bi-lane tunnel once completed would ensure all-weather connectivity across the Nechiphu Pass besides providing a safe and secure passage through accident-prone areas.

Harpal Singh, Director General BRO, said construction of 28 major bridges was completed while 102 more major bridges are being completed this year of which 54 have already been completed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6qagys/article32832955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJNATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajnath-singh-inaugurates-44-bridges-built-by-bro-in-border-areas/article32832891.ece
47,2020/10/12,"Govt to give cash vouchers to staff in lieu of LTC this year, says Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman","The Minister has announced a slew of measures to spur spending and stimulate economic demand.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled new proposals to stimulate demand in the economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Addressing a press conference, Ms. Sitharaman said that she has broadly classified the proposals into two different compartments — consumer spending and capital expenditure.

She said: ""There is no gain saying that the pandemic has affected the economy adversely. The needs of the weaker and poor sections have been addressed somewhat in the various packages announced so far. Supply constraints have somewhat eased but consumer demand still needs to be given a bit of a boost. The proposals presented today are defined in such a way — by frontloading some expenditure or advancing some expenditure with some offsetting charges later. The others are directly linked to an increase in the GDP.""

Consumer spending proposals

The Finance Minister said that the consumer spending proposals include a LTC cash vouchers scheme and a special festival advance scheme. The LTC Cash Vouchers scheme is mainly targetted to employees in the government and other organised sectors.

The Minister described the scheme as follows: ""Government and many organised sector employees have their jobs and salaries protected and some initial indications suggest savings have increased as many couldn’t spend their usual expenditure during the lockdown.""

She continued: ""Central government employees, in a block of four years — between 2017-18 and 2020-21 — employees would have normally availed of one leave travel concession for any destination of their choice plus one visit to their hometown. If they didn’t choose leave travel to one destination of their choice, they would usually go twice to their native village. This would mean air or rail fare as per their pay scale is reimbursed to them. In addition, they also get ten days of leave encashment, which they pay tax on. The travel fare is tax exempt.""

In the new scheme, all this remains the same, but they can include travel now, said Ms. Sitharaman. ""Many of them don’t want to because of COVID-19. Instead, what we are offering is to give the money to them based on three slabs — as per government rules and procedures — they could spend it to buy something of their choice. These are flat rate slabs equivalent to the round ticket fare they would have spent. This must be spent on items that have 12% GST or more; for instance, you cannot use it to buy food that has 5% GST slab. You can only spend them in digital mode only, no cash payments,"" explained the FM.

""You will also have to buy only from GST-registered sellers so a GST invoice would be required on the basis of which they will be reimbursed. This spending has to be completed by March 31, 2021,"" she said.

This, the Finance Minister said, is a way to incentivise those whose jobs have not been affected due to the pandemic to contribute to revival of demand for the benefit of the less fortunate.

Three times the amount equivalent to the return air/rail fare would have to be spent to qualify for this.

If the Central government employees opt for it, it would cost ₹5,675 crore. Public sector employees can also avail this, which would cost ₹1,900 crore that they would have got as LTC anyway.

The Minister added that the tax concessions are available for the State governments and the private sector companies too. ""So if they choose to give such things to their employees, they will also get the same benefit that central employees would get. According to our estimates, the demand infusion into the economy from the Centre and PSUs would be ₹19,000 crore. If 50% of States join in this, this could spur further demand of ₹9,000 crore. These are conservative estimates,"" said Ms. Sitharaman.

""States have their own LTC rules and they can come up with variations in the scheme. So additional consumer demand generated, we expect, would be in the range of ₹28,000 crore,"" she said.

Special Festival Advance Scheme

The second proposal to spur consumer spending is the Special Festival Advance Scheme, said the Finance Minister.

""Till the Sixth Pay Commission, there was a festival advance scheme in which the highest level of advance was was ₹4,500 per non-gazetted officers. However, there was no such scheme in the Seventh Pay Commission. We are now reviving it as a one-time affair,"" said Ms. Sitharaman.

However, this will not be limited to non-gazetted officers, she said. ""Under this scheme, ₹10,000 will be available to all central government employees, irrespective of their rank, instead of ₹4,500 that was available in the Sixth Pay Commission. This will be repaid in ten instalments and will be available upto March 31, 2021,"" she said.

""A prepaid Rupay card will be given to the availees as an interest-free advance for use in any festival. We are not limiting it for any one festival or GST-only shops. You can spend it anywhere you want. But you cannot withdraw it as cash. The spending will have to be done by March 31, 2021. The bank charges for loading the card will be paid by the central government.,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

She said that the government expects consumer spending to be boosted by ₹8,000 crore from this move, and added that ₹4,000 crore will be disbursed by the Centre under this provision.

Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said that if State governments participate, another ₹8,000 crore could be disbursed. ""Our additional consumer demand estimate assumes half of the States opting to do this too. This will also boost tax revenue and will benefit honest traders,"" he said.

New thrust for capital expenditure

Speaking on the States' and the Centre's proposals on capital expenditure, Ms. Sitharaman said, ""Capital expenditure on infrastructure building and anything that goes into asset building, has a greater multiplier effect on the economy. It raises present GDP but also impacts future GDP. We want to now give a new thrust for capital expenditure"".

""50-year interest free loan is being offered to States worth Rs 12,000 crore. This includes ₹2,500 crore for the eight North Eastern States (Rs 200 crore each) and Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh will get Rs 450 crore each.

""The second component will relate to all other States - ₹7,500 crore to be divided in proportion to the share of the Finance Commission devolutions. States can spend this on capex, 50% will be given upfront with the rest to be given after the first tranche utilised. But all of this will have to be spent by March 31, 2021.

""The third component of the ₹12,000 crore entails - ₹2,000 crore will be kept for those States that fulfill at least three of the four conditions put in May for giving performance-related borrowing flexibility to States under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package. This can be used for new or ongoing projects and even to pay existing dues. No payment is required from the States till after 50 years,"" the Finance Minister said.

On enhanced capital provisions from the Centre, Ms. Sitharaman said ₹25,000 crore has been allotted in addition to the earlier figure set aside for capital expenditure of ₹4,13,000 crore. ""This will be for capex, specifically on roads, urban development, water supply, defence infrastructure, and domestically produced capital equipment for defence infrastructure,"" she said.

These allocations will be made during the forthcoming revised estimate discussions.

""So, ₹73,000 crore boost is expected to the economy by March 31, 2020, including 36,000 crore of additional consumer demand will be created and ₹37,000 crore of capital expenditure. Another₹28,000 crore boost can be expected if potential private sector spending also happens. We would suggest to the private sector to consider this.

""This is a conservative estimate - the total additional demand could total ₹1 lakh crore, I believe. Measures to stimulate demand must not burden the common citizen through future inflation. We have kept that in mind. We have also kept in mind that this should not result in unsustainable government debt. Today's solutions should not cause tomorrow's problems,"" Ms. Sitharaman added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/74mnvk/article32532185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THBUNIRMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-unveils-new-proposals-to-stimulate-economic-demand/article32832782.ece

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday took a jibe at the State governments that have agreed to the Centre’s borrowing proposal on the GST compensation issue and asked people as to why their Chief Ministers were “mortgaging” their future for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In a tweet, Mr. Gandhi said, “1. Centre promises GST revenue for States. 2. Economy shattered by PM & Covid. 3. PM gives (Rs) 1.4 lakh Crs tax cuts to Corporates, buys 2 planes for himself for (Rs) 8400 Crs. 4. Centre has no money to pay States 5. FM tells States- Borrow”.

Why is your CM mortgaging your future for Modi? — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) October 12, 2020

“Why is your CM mortgaging your future for Modi?” he asked.

In August, the Centre gave two options to the States to borrow either ₹97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the Reserve Bank of India or ₹2.35 lakh crore from the market. It had also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.

The Hindu Explains | What is the GST compensation due to States?

Following demand by some States, the amount of ₹97,000 crore was increased to ₹1.10 lakh crore.

As many as 21 States — which are mostly BJP-ruled or have supported it on various issues — have opted to borrow ₹1.10 lakh crore to meet the compensation shortfall.

The Centre has released ₹20,000 crore to the States towards the compensation shortfall so far in the current fiscal.

Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fu8fjb/article32683715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/rahulgandhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-is-your-cm-mortgaging-your-future-for-modi-rahul-to-people-on-gst-compensation/article32831949.ece

Congress national spokesperson Kushboo Sundar on Monday tendered her resignation from the party and joined BJP in the presence of Tamil Nadu State BJP President L. Murugan and BJP National General Secretary C.T. Ravi.

Following this, Pranav Jha, AICC secretary in-charge of Communications announced the dropping of Ms. Kushboo as spokesperson of the party with immediate effect.

“Kushboo Sundar is hereby dropped as AICC spokesperson with immediate effect,” said a statement from AICC secretary in-charge of communications Pranav Jha.

In a letter to party President Sonia Gandhi, Ms. Kushboo said, “I came into the fold of INC at the time when it was at its lowest, being defeated in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. I did not walk in the party for any monetary gains, name or fame. Few elements seated at higher levels within the party, people who have no connectivity with the ground reality or public recognition are dictating terms and people like me who wanted to work for the party sincerely, are being pushed and suppressed.” She also extended her thanks to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

Ms. Kushboo left for Delhi on Sunday night. At the airport, she told the media that she wouldn’t like to comment on the rumours.

Ms. Kushboo, who previously denied the speculations that she was joining the BJP, said on Sunday that change was inevitable. “Many see a change in me. Well as you age, you evolve n grow, learn n unlearn, perceptions change, likes n dislikes too, thoughts n ideas take a new shape, dreams are new, you understand the difference between like n love, between right n wrong. Change is inevitable,” she said in a tweet.

Last week, Ms. Kushboo told The Hindu that she was not going anywhere away from the Congress and that rumours of her joining the BJP had been doing the rounds since 2014.

Even last week, Ms. Kushboo slammed the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over the alleged gang rape in Hathras. She has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government at the Centre.

Five Benches of two to three judges in different combinations had been sitting on working days to hear around 20 cases daily since the outbreak of COVID-19 in March.

According to the apex court’s website, 10 Benches of two to three judges and two single judge Benches will sit daily from October 12 to hear cases.

The increased strength will double the output of the Supreme Court, which has decided not to start physical hearings yet due to the COVID-19 situation in the country.

The top court has been hearing matters through videoconferencing since March 23, two days before a nationwide lockdown was imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19.

As per the cause list for October 12, eight Benches will have three judges each and two other Benches with two judges each to hear cases.

There will be two single-judge Benches to hear and decide transfer petitions.

After the pandemic hit the country, the apex court’s registry has been functioning with a reduced number of staffers due to various reasons, including lack of adequate public transport facilities.

52,2020/10/12,"After alumni found in terror groups, Shopian school comes under radar","The school’s students mainly hail from Kulgam, Pulwama and Anantnag, considered hotbeds of militancy

A religious school in Shopian district of south Kashmir has come under the scanner of investigating agencies after 13 of its students were found to have joined terror groups, officials said here.

The institution’s students include Sajjad Bhat, an accused in the February 2019 suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama that left 40 personnel dead.

The school’s students mainly hail from Kulgam, Pulwama and Anantnag districts of south Kashmir, considered by the intelligence agencies to be the hotbeds of militancy and breeding grounds for recruitment of locals into various terror groups, officials said.

It also had outstation students from Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Telangana, but their numbers dropped to almost nil after removal of Article 370 last year, the officials said.

Terrorism ideology

According to an official, since most students and faculty at the school hail from the terror-infected districts of Shopian and Pulwama, the ideology of terrorism may be flourishing there and in turn affecting the students belonging to other places too.

The officials feel that at the same time, the outside environment, local population, terror-related activities and regular encounters of militants also play an effective role in propagating the ideology of terrorism.

During investigation of the ghastly attack of February 14 last year when a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden car into a CRPF convoy killing 40 personnel, the intelligence agencies found that Bhat, whose vehicle was used used in the attack, had done his schooling from this same religious institute in Shopian district.

The list of the institute’s students involved in terrorism started expanding with the death of Zubair Nengroo, a so-called commander of the banned Al-Badr terror organisation, in August this year. Nengroo too was a student of the same religious school.

According to an internal report, there are at least 13 listed terrorists and hundreds of over ground workers (OGWs) who are either students or alumni of this institute.

Recently a youth from Baramulla went missing while returning to the school from his home after vacations. It was later found that he had joined the terrorist ranks.

“Most of these 13 terrorists are natives of Shopian and Pulwama,” the report said.

Besides Bhat and Nengroo, the list of 13 alumni includes Hizbul Mujahideen militant Nazim Nazir Dar, and Aijaz Ahmad Paul who was gunned down by the security forces in an encounter on August 4 in Shopian.

The officials feel that institutions such as this school become breeding grounds for recruitment into terrorist outfits such as Hizbul Mujahideen, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Al-Badr and Lashker-e-Taiba as stories of killed terrorists depicting them as heroes are spread around through various means.

“These factors leave a strong print in the minds of the students and when influenced by the society and friends lead them to joining terrorist ranks. It has been found in certain cases that the education of these kinds of religious institutions is encouraging the students to join terrorist ranks,” said an official.

The report pointed out that many day scholar students have been found to be involved in stone pelting, agitations and law and order situations against the security forces. “These students may spread the message of separatist ideology, hate against the government while glorifying the acts of terrorists,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/after-alumni-found-in-terror-groups-shopian-school-comes-under-radar/article32829459.ece
53,2020/10/12,Bajwa urges PM to intervene and settle Punjab cane farmers’ dues,"They wait for years to get paid: Cong. MP

Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to step in to ensure that arrears due to the sugarcane farmers in Punjab are paid in a timely manner.

Pointing out that in Punjab, the outstanding sugarcane payment stood at ₹306.59 crore, as on July 7, 2020, Mr. Bajwa, in a letter to the Prime Minister, said 72% of total cane crushed had been purchased by the private sugar mills in Punjab and about 28% by the cooperative sugar mills. “The sugar mills are bound to make cane payments within 14 days of purchase of cane according to the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966, and the Sugarcane Purchase and Supply Regulation Act, 1957. Otherwise they will have to make payments along with interest. But it is a matter of great concern that farmers have to beg and wait for years to be paid their dues.”

Mr. Bajwa added that the farmers must receive payments within a timeframe, if there was to be any impetus on crop diversification. “It is unacceptable that the farmer has to wait months or even years for their payments. In this scenario, why would they look to diversify their crop production with these risks?” he said.

Urging the Prime Minister to look into the matter, Mr. Bajwa suggested that mill operators with unpaid dues for a year or more be banned from operating in the market. “Also, the government should look into fiscal measures or budgetary provisions that can be used to clear the dues of the farmers in a timely fashion and recover the same from the erring mill operators,” he wrote.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bajwa-urges-pm-to-intervene-and-settle-punjab-cane-farmers-dues/article32829437.ece

Lilong is one of the constituencies where Congress MLAs had resigned. However, the outgoing Congress MLA Abdul Nasir declined to join the BJP. The BJP said it would contest in Wangoi, Wangjing Tentha, Saitu and Singhat. The BJP candidates for these constituencies are Oinam Lukhoi, now a Minister; Paonam Brojen, Ngamthang Haokip and Ginsawhao respectively.

Several people took to the streets to protest against the “negligence of the minority” by the BJP. One activist said they would not return home until a clarification was issued by Chief Minister N. Biren or other party leaders.

Mr. Nasir, one of the six Congress MLAs who had resigned from the party, declined to join the BJP and become a candidate for the Lilong constituency from where he was elected in 2016.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on October 11 directed officials to get the killing of a temple priest in Karauli district probed by the CID-CB.

He also condemned the BJP’s “attempt to give a communal colour” to a land dispute between two families, which led to the death of the priest.

“It is condemnable that the BJP gave a communal colour to the tragic incident between the Meena and Vaishnav communities of a land dispute case between two families in Bukna villlage of Sapotara. This has undermined the image of Rajasthan unnecessarily,” Mr. Gehlot said in a statement.

He said the priest’s death was not the result of a caste conflict, neither a pre-planned incident.

The dispute between the two families over taking the possession of a piece of land resulted in the tragic incident.

On October 6, a day before the incident, the panchayat had agreed in favour of priest Babu Lal Vaishnav, in which a majority of people of the Meena community were present.

Directions have been issued to get the case investigated by the CID-CB. Superintendent of Police (SP) Vikas Sharma has been assigned the task, the statement said.

Mr. Gehlot said the Congress government has always been striving to give protection to priests and the land that comes under various temples.

Owing to the land dispute, Vaishnav was allegedly set on fire and he died at the SMS Hospital in Jaipur on Thursday. It is alleged that five people, trying to occupy the cultivated land near the temple, set ablaze the priest by spraying petrol.

57,2020/10/12,"Odisha bypolls | BJP declares candidates, Congress, BJD gear up to announce nominees","With the BJP announcing its candidates for the upcoming bypolls to two Assembly constituencies in Odisha, political activities are gradually intensifying in the State as the ruling BJD and the Congress are zeroing in on their nominees.

Manas Kumar Dutta, son of late MLA Madan Mohan Dutta, was on October 11 declared by the BJP as its candidate for Balasore Sadar seat, while Rajkishore Behera, who had left the Congress recently, has been fielded in Tirtol Assembly segment.

The names of the two candidates were announced by BJP national general secretary Arun Singh, following a meeting of the party’s central election committee, a senior leader said.

The BJP has fielded Mr. Dutta in Balasore Sadar seat, apparently in an effort to get sympathy votes as the death of his father, who represented the constituency since 2019 as a saffron party legislator, has necessitated the by-election.

Expressing his gratitude to senior leaders of the BJP for reposing faith in him, Mr. Dutta said he will work hard to make the dreams of his father a reality and ensure the overall development of the constituency.

It will be a maiden electoral battle for the 31-year-old candidate who happens to be a graphic designer. Mr. Dutta was nominated as BJP’s coordinator for the Assembly constituency around a month ago.

Similarly, the by-election in the Tirtol Assembly constituency in Jagatsinghpur has been necessitated following the demise of BJD MLA Bishnu Charan Das.

Mr. Behera, who has been picked by the saffron party for Tirtol seat, had recently left the Congress to join the saffron party. He had contested both 2009 and 2014 Assembly elections from the constituency as Congress nominee but lost.

While Tirtol is regarded as a traditional BJD bastion, the BJP is working hard to capture the seat in the by- election.

Mr. Behera said people of Tirtol want a political change and will vote for BJP as they feel cheated by the ruling BJD in the State.

The BJP took a lead in announcing its candidates for the bypolls, the Congress has also geared up to finalise its nominees.

AICC’s Odisha in-charge A. Chellakumar has already visited both the Assembly segments as part of the exercise to finalise party candidates for the by-elections.

Similarly, senior leaders of the ruling BJD have been going to the two Assembly segments to gauge the mood of the party workers as well as voters before finalising the candidates.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v9hw52/article32735957.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BJP02KB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/odisha-bypolls-bjp-declares-candidates-congress-bjd-gear-up-to-announce-nominees/article32830015.ece
58,2020/10/12,"Two weeks into paddy procurement in Punjab, farmers still waiting for payment","Delay would hamper sowing for rabi season. It will lead to borrowing money which will only add to our woes, they say

Amid the COVID-19 scare, 44-year old Gurpreet Singh from Tole Majra village with his paddy-laden tractor-trolley arrived at Kharar’s grain market in Punjab on a sunny day on Saturday — he seems content with the procurement arrangements at the ‘mandi’ (market yard). However, he, as many other farmers, is anxious about “timely payment” of produce purchased by government agencies.

“I brought 40 quintal paddy in the morning to the mandi here and by afternoon my produce was sold. I didn’t have to wait for long..everything was seamless. There’s no space crunch in the mandi nor labour shortage. However, my main concern is about receiving the payment. My ‘arthiya’ [commission agent] told me that I’ll get the payment at least 12-15 days later because the process of payments has not yet started from the government’s end,” said Mr. Gurpreet.

“I’ll get around ₹75,500 for the paddy that I had sold. But if I’ll get the payment after 15 days then it will create difficulties for me. I need to prepare my field for sowing of wheat for which I need money immediately. If my payment is delayed how will I plant my next crop? The government should make the payment within 3-4 days at the most after the crop is sold,” he said.

Mr. Gurpreet’s commission agent, who requested anonymity, said: “Till October 10, at least 30 farmers have sold paddy at the Minimum Support Price through me, but payment for none of them has been received from the government agencies. As far as I know, only three day ago the cash credit limit has been sanctioned by the RBI for making MSP payment. So, now I am hopeful that payments would start coming in from the ensuing week,” said the agent.

Expressing similar concern, Harbans Singh of Jandpur village said the delay in timely payment would hamper his sowing for rabi (winter) season. “I have to buy seeds and other things for wheat sowing, but if there’s a delay in the payment, which is quite evident, then I’ll have to borrow money from someone..It will only add to woes,” said Mr. Harbans, who had sown paddy in 17 acres.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had recently asked the Food and Civil Supplies department to ensure prompt lifting of the produce and release of payment within the stipulated time-frame of 72 hours. Paddy procurement commenced on September 27 due to early arrival of the crop this year owing to advance planting. The procurement operations would continue till November 30.

Till October 10, 23.11 lakh tonnes paddy has arrived in the ‘mandis’ across Punjab, of which 21.93 lakh tonnes has been procured by various agencies. Punjab is targeting procurement of 171 lakh tonnes in the ongoing season.

Kesar Singh, a farmer from Khanpur village, said procurement arrangements are far better this season in comparison to the wheat procurement in April-June. “The State government has increased the number of centres for crop’s purchase, which has reduced crowding. I have come with over 100 quintals and my commission agent has informed me that payment is expected to come in my account in the next 15 days..It’s a long wait,” said Mr. Kesar, who has planted paddy in close to 20 acres.

To ensure hassle-free and safe procurement amid COVID-19, the Punjab Mandi Board has notified over 4,200 purchase points for procurement of paddy. To avoid mass gatherings and ensure staggered procurement, the Mandi board has issued 7.71 lakh passes to farmers till October 10. Four state procurement agencies including Punjab Grains Procurement Corporation Ltd, Markfed, State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd and State Warehousing Corporation besides the FCI are procuring paddy. The A grade paddy is being procured at the MSP of ₹1,888 per quintal.

Farmer outfits are also anguished about the delay in the payment. “The Central government should have asked the RBI to sanction the cash credit limit in September month itself. While the procurement started on September 27, the cash credit limit for Punjab was sanctioned on October 7. This reflects the indifferent attitude of the Central government towards farmers. They want to create hurdles in the MSP mechanism to eventually dismantle it. The State government is also to be blamed as it did not push for early sanctioning of the limit,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartaiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).

“With the cash credit limit now being sanctioned, the State government, through its agencies should immediately start making payments and keep its promise of releasing payment within 72 hours of crop’s purchase,” he said.

60,2020/10/12,Security beefed up in Srinagar after blogger posts ‘hit list’,"Post by unknown blogger names 29 persons including journalists and activists

Security was beefed up at Srinagar's Press Enclave, which houses offices of newspapers and TV channels, days after a “hit list” was uploaded online by an unknown blogger, suspected to be supported by the armed groups in Kashmir.

A police official told The Hindu that a number of additional closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras have been installed at all entry and exit points of Press Enclave “to monitor movement of any armed men”. The number of security personnel and mobile bunkers manning the area has also been increased.

“A list of political, media persons, public figures and also posts of Lashkar-i-Islam were uploaded with the intention to create fear psychosis among individuals,” the police said.

The police said an investigation is underway against the unknown blogger for uploading a list of 29 persons, including journalists, editors and activists working with local, and national dailies and TV channels.

A police official said the Police Station Kothibagh on October 3 lodged a First Information Report (FIR) after the “hit list” went viral online against a wordpress blogger, kashmirfight.com.

A joint statement issued by the media, including the Kashmir Editors Guild, the J&K Editors Forum, the Kashmir Press Association, Kashmir Press Club, the Kashmir Working Journalists Association, Kashmir National Television Journalist Association etc., noted with regret what they described as “""vilification of individuals representing the institution of media”.

61,2020/10/12,U.S. turns focus on Bangladesh for Indo-Pacific Strategy,"Visit of senior diplomat aims to counter Beijing’s growing influence

Bangladesh is expected to be the focus of the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Strategy when Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun arrives in Dhaka for a visit from October 14-16.

The visit by the senior American official is the first such attempt by the U.S. administration to engage Dhaka directly ever since Beijing undertook several proactive measures to help the South Asian country deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The Deputy Secretary’s engagement in Bangladesh will focus on advancing our common vision of a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and secure Indo-Pacific region with shared prosperity for all, U.S.-Bangladesh cooperation on COVID-19 response and recovery efforts, and sustainable economic development,” the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka said in a statement announcing Mr. Biegun’s visit.

Long hiatus

The visit of the senior American official is the clearest sign so far of Trump administration's desire to draw Bangladesh closer as a key Indo-Pacific partner. Bangladesh has not hosted a senior U.S. diplomat of this stature since the visit of Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2016 during the last phase of the Obama administration.

Mr Biegun’s visit to Dhaka will be followed by his interactions in New Delhi. The senior diplomat will arrive in India on Monday where he is expected to do the groundworks for the “2+2” dialogue between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Defence Secretary Mark T Esper and their Indian counterparts External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during the coming weeks.

The American campaign to draw Bangladesh into a closer embrace in the Indo-Pacific has been growing steadily over the past few weeks.

Widening embrace

Mr. Esper spoke with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on September 11 when both sides explored cooperation within the framework of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. The discussion with Ms Hasina, who also holds the defence portfolio, was followed by an interaction between Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Laura Stone and Bangladesh decision makers. The interactions and the visit of Mr. Biegun is especially significant as they are being held in the backdrop of growing display of Chinese assertiveness in the region.

It is significant that the U.S. is focusing on Bangladesh, a close neighbour of India after concluding a Defence Cooperation Agreement with the Maldives in September. This is part of a trend of the direct exchanges between the U.S. and smaller South Asian nations in recent weeks.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also held a telephone discussion with the Foreign Minister of Nepal Pradeep Kumar Gyawali in June.

China which has already gained several landmark infrastructure projects in Bangladesh, sent a medical team to Dhaka to assist with the COVID-19 situation and has received Dhaka's permission to carry out human trials of an anti-COVID-19 vaccine being produced by Sinovac Biotech, a private company in China. The decision to carry out the Phase 3 human trial of the Chinese vaccine was announced by Bangladesh on August 27.

The seemingly intense interactions between China and Bangladesh have attracted attention from multiple stakeholders including Indian commentators, who have viewed the Beijing-Dhaka exchanges through the prism of ongoing tension along the India-China LAC in Eastern Ladakh.

Earlier, the U.S. sent out a clear message about its regional ambition in the Indo-Pacific with the National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien referring to the Communist Party of China’s “territorial aggression” along the Line of Actual Control with India.

Rohingya issue

Mr. Biegun’s visit gives Dhaka a chance to take up the Rohingya issue with the United States. The issue is among the most important for Bangladesh and it has discussed the same with India repeatedly ever since the community was displaced from the Rakhine State of Myanmar because of Yangon’s military campaign.

However, China has also signalled that it remains alert to Dhaka's serious concern about Myanmar refusing to take back the Rohingya refugees. On Sunday, Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming met with Foreign Minister Dr. A K Abdul Momen and expressed Beijing’s concern about Myanmar’s lack of interest in repatriating the million plus Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-turns-focus-on-bangladesh-for-indo-pacific-strategy/article32828837.ece

63,2020/10/12,COVID: South coastal Andhra keeps up the positive trend,"SHGs roped in to identify people with low oxygen levels

In a welcome development, there were more recoveries with the number of fresh cases and fatalities also declining in south coastal Andhra Pradesh in the last 24 hours.

The daily tally, which hovered around 1,000 or more during last month, has now come down drastically to less than 500 during this month. Similarly, the number of deaths, which had been in the double digit during the previous month, came down to single digit this month.

Meanwhile, the Prakasam district administration decided to rope in members of Self Help Groups(SHGs) in the fight against the respiratory disease. The SHG women would be given pulse oximeter to identify people suffering from low oxygen levels.

Catching those with low oxygen levels is crucial to treat even a mild case of COVID-19, while early check-up will also reduce mortality rate by taking those requiring critical care to hospitals immediately, Prakasam District Collector P.Bhaskar said while reviewing the health situation.

The staff of MEPMA in urban areas and Velugu project in rural areas would handle the distribution of the device to SHGs which could help in identifying persons with oxygen issue.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a7ywpf/article32837903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13VJONGCASES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-south-coastal-andhra-keeps-up-the-positive-trend/article32837904.ece

74,2020/10/12,Police thwart move to unload ammonium nitrate at Vizag port,"NOC from local authorities mandatory, say officials

The attempt to berth MV Kraszewski carrying 20,041 tonnes of ammonium nitrate at the Visakhapatnam Port and unload the cargo was stopped by the city police and the district administration, after the police enforced orders under CrPC Section 144 and the district administration under CrPC Section 133.

Ever since a storage facility containing about 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded in Beirut, Lebanon, on August 4, import and storage of the chemical in the country has come under the scanner.

In Visakhapatnam, the licence of the sole stevedoring company that was handling and storing ammonium nitrate was cancelled, following alleged non-compliance of the norms specified under the Ammonium Nitrate Rules of 2012.

Since then the ship has been kept waiting in the high seas and based on a proposal from the Explosives Manufacturers’ Welfare Association and the importers, the VPT had written a letter to the AP Pollution Control Board, clarifying certain doubts raised by the board and also informing the proposed berthing of the ship and discharge of the cargo.

The ship was supposed to be berthed on Monday, with the assurance by importers of transporting the cargo by rail or trucks to the respective factory sites.

Clarification

But the berthing was stopped after the police clarified that the licences given by PESO to the stevedoring companies from other places, is not valid until an NOC is obtained from local authorities, which include the Commissioner of Police.

“The local person’s licence has been cancelled and the cargo cannot be discharged by the companies holding a licence and NOCs at other places,” said Commissioner of Police Manish Kumar Sinha.

The VPT authorities also confirmed that the berthing of the ship has been deferred till October 31, and the licence holders have been advised to obtain NOCs from the authorities concerned in Visakhapatnam.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/police-thwart-move-to-unload-ammonium-nitrate-at-vizag-port/article32836378.ece
75,2020/10/12,A.P. HC orders CBI probe into social media posts on judges,"Bench says such personal attacks an affront to the judicial wing of democracy

In a judgment of far-reaching consequences, a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court comprising Justices Rakesh Kumar and J. Uma Devi on Monday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation(CBI) to probe the comments and social media posts by leaders of YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), including Legislative Assembly Speaker Thammineni Seetharam, on some Judges, and submit its report in eight weeks.

The Judges gave liberty to the CBI to register a fresh FIR, if necessary. They expressed displeasure on the alleged inaction of the government departments concerned on a complaint lodged by the then Registrar-General of the High Court, while questioning the reason for the alacrity with which the objectionable remarks made on elected representatives of the ruling party were acted upon.

The Bench observed that the CBI had better resources at its command to dig out the facts.

Advocate-General S. Sriram conceded saying that he would not object if the court did not cast any aspersions on the government or the CID on posts against the Judges.

The court stated that the circumstances under which the Judges were targeted needed to be investigated thoroughly, as such personal attacks were an affront to the judicial wing of democracy.

It may be recalled that the YSRCP leaders attributed motives to the Judges for the orders issued by them in diverse matters which included the “three capitals”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/4szfwn/article32838170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-andhra-pradesh-VJ-HIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ap-hc-orders-cbi-probe-into-social-media-posts-on-judges/article32835662.ece
76,2020/10/12,Praja Arogya Vedika seeks revised protocol for COVID-19 treatment,"‘Widespread attack, mutations and variations of the virus are being noticed among patients’

The government should come out with a revised protocol for treatment of COVID-19, after comprehensive research and a study on long-term health impact on persons, who have recovered from COVID-19, according to Praja Arogya Vedika (PAV) general secretary T. Kameswara Rao and president M.V. Ramanayya.

In a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, the PAV leaders noted that widespread attack, mutations and variations of the virus were being noticed among patients. This calls for a revised protocol of treatment whether 28 or 90 days, to instil confidence among people.

The total number of cases recorded in the country as on October 11, was 69,79,423. There is no specific medicine and vaccine. The cases are continuously rising even as medical experts are not in a position to estimate as to how long the pandemic is going to last or whether it would increase further or a second wave of virus attack would be there.

It is good to note that in our country the recovery rate is high and approximately more than 6.08 million people have recovered from the disease. The subject of concern is that among the post-COVID patients, even after 21 or 28 days, the patients are still complaining about persistent cough, fatigue, body aches, breathing issues, fever, heart, kidney, liver and associated problems.

Many recovered patients are still taking the COVID-19 protocol medicines like steroids and blood thinners, and above all, these the patients are becoming panicky, leading to a lot of mental agony, and compelling them to take other medications, the PAV leaders said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/praja-arogya-vedika-seeks-revised-protocol-for-covid-19-treatment/article32835266.ece

Two youth from Tirupati, who had gone to the Chandragiri hill fort on Saturday, were found dead in the pond atop the hillock and their bodies were fished out and shifted to area hospital for autopsy.

According to the Chandragiri police, three youth had gone to the fort on Saturday evening and gained access to the hilltop that has been under surveillance for sometime now.

When they reportedly ventured into the water body on the hillock to swim, unaware of its depth, two of them lost balance and slipped in the pond and started drowning, said the police. The third youth, Mahesh (17), who had stayed back, shouted in vain for help. He ran down the hill and informed the fort officials, besides passing on the information to the area police.

The police, in coordination with the fire department personnel, launched a search that went on for three hours on Saturday night and was resumed in the early hours of Sunday. After a two-hour-long operation, the two bodies of the youth – identified as Rangam (27) and Anudeep (23) – were found stuck in between rocks. The bodies were shifted to the SVRR Hospital for autopsy. A case was registered.

‘Dangerous depths’

The Circle-Inspector (Chandragiri) said that the pond is known for its dangerous terrain and depth. He said that the fort officials were told to mount vigil on the stretch leading to the hillock.

Youth saved

Meanwhile, the Pakala circle police in the early hours of Sunday saved the lives of two youth from the swirling waters of a rivulet, when they were washed away while negotiating an overflowing causeway beneath a railway bridge. The duo, along with their motorbike, was washed away in the gush of waters following heavy rains in the area.

People who were about to cross the causeway saw them calling for help and immediately informed the police. Sub-Inspector (Pakala) K. Rajasekhar and his team rushed to the spot and helped the duo reach to safety.

Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar congratulated the police team on their successful rescue mission.

80,2020/10/12,HRF condoles death of civil rights activist Seshaiah,"‘He was actively involved in progressive politics’

The Human Rights Forum (HRF) has condoled the passing away of civil rights activist and convenor of the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana Coordination Committee of the Civil Liberties Committee (CLC) S. Seshaiah on October 10.

Seshaiah was afflicted with COVID-19 recently and after initial treatment at Anantapur, he was rushed to Hyderabad last week but succumbed at about 8.30 p.m. on Saturday.

For over four decades, Seshaiah had been actively involved in progressive politics - as a Left social activist and then in the arena of civil liberties as functionary of the AP Civil Liberties Committee (APCLC), which renamed itself post-bifurcation as Civil Liberties Committee.

He taught law for many decades at the Sri Krishnadevaraya University in Anantapur, HRF Coordination Committee Members V.S. Krishna (A.P.) and S. Jeevan Kumar (Telangana) said in a statement here on Sunday. Seshaiah became State general secretary of the APCLC in 1998 during very turbulent times.

Leading activists of the APCLC T. Purushottam and Azam Ali were targeted and killed by members of counter-insurgent criminal gangs going by names like Green Tigers on 23 November, 2000, and 18 February, 2001, in Hyderabad and Nalgonda respectively.

Seshaiah was also subjected to intimidation that included an attack on his house and the burning of his car on the night of November 11, 2005, by unknown persons calling themselves members of Rayalseema Tigers.

81,2020/10/12,Govt. to introduce energy conservation policy,"It elicits views of experts, Central agencies and institutions in this regard

In an attempt to achieve energy security, cost-effective power and strengthen the power sector, the State government is contemplating to introduce a new policy for promotion of the use of the latest and efficient technologies for energy conservation in various sectors, according to a release by State Energy Conservation Mission CEO A. Chandra Sekhar Reddy.

He stated that the Energy Department was eliciting the views of experts and the Central agencies such as Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) and institutes such as The Energy Resources Institute (TERI), Central Board of Irrigation and Power and Alliance for Energy Efficient Economy for formulating the policy.

The policy is aimed at conserving energy being used in industries, buildings, civic bodies , agriculture, transport, power utilities, commercial and residential sectors.

According to the BEE report 2018-19, India ranks the highest in terms of growth rate of energy consumption in the world. The consumption is expected to grow and accounts for 11% of the global energy demand by 2040. The energy use is expected to more than double by the same year in the country.

Growing demand

Energy demand will be more in A.P. due to the growth in agriculture activity, industrialisation and urbanisation. In view of this, efficient use of energy assumes importance. Saving of one unit of energy reduces the need for fresh capacity creation by 2 to 2.5 times. Energy efficiency helps meet power requirement apart from reducing fossil fuel consumption.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-to-introduce-energy-conservation-policy/article32829609.ece
82,2020/10/12,Naidu fanning Amaravati protest for selfish gain: Botcha,"‘The government has a clear vision for development of all regions in the State’

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Botcha Satyanarayana on Sunday said that TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu was organising protests with his ‘paid artistes’ against the proposed three capitals to safeguard the wealth he had amassed by ‘insider trading’.

Addressing the media here on Sunday, the Minister criticised Mr. Naidu for asking people to protest in the name of Amaravati, claiming that the call by the TDP chief did not get any response from any region in the State.

Reiterating that the government has a clear vision for developments of all regions of the State equally, the Minister said that people from all 13 districts had welcomed the decision to set up three capitals.

He also said that the decentralisation process began from the day the Bill pertaining to the issue was passed in the Assembly. The YSRCP government would make overcome all the hurdles and set up three capitals in the State.

Vizag land scam

Referring to the land scam allegations in Visakhapatnam, Mr. Satyanarayana said that the SIT investigation would be completed soon and the report would be made public.

Responding on allegations made by TDP leaders that the YSRCP leaders were involved in corruption, the Minister said the State government was ready to face any kind of inquiry. “Fearing investigation followed by arrests in the insider trading case, it was the TDP leaders who moved the court of law to get a stay and this proves their involvement in the Amaravati land scam,” he added.

MANSAS Trust row

Speaking about the reported move by the MANSAS Trust to privatise the MR College in Vizianagaram and other issues, the Minister said it is a private matter of the Pusapati family and the State government has nothing to do with it. He accused former Union Minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju of spreading false propaganda against the government.

“The government is focussing on development of Visakhapatnam Metro Rail project and the detailed project report for the project is being prepared,” said Mr. Satyanarayana.

The Minister also said that steps were being taken by the GVMC to treat sewage water. Keeping in the view the growing traffic in Visakhapatnam, flyovers, under-bridges and subways would be constructed at major junctions, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/zb3vtn/article32691922.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25VJPG4-BOTCHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-fanning-amaravati-protest-for-selfish-gain-botcha/article32829586.ece

Rushikonda Beach and seven other beaches in India have been conferred the coveted eco-label ‘Blue Flag’. All these beaches will now be on the global map. District Collector V. Vinay Chand confirmed that a communication was received from Sanjai Jalla, Mission Leader, Blue Flag Beaches of India.

The other seven beaches, which have been conferred the tag are — Shivrajpur (Gujarat), Ghoghla (Diu), Kasarkod (Karnataka), Padubidri (Karnataka), Kappad (Kerala) Golden (Odisha) and Radhanagar (Andaman).

All the eight beaches have been conferred the ‘Blue Flag’ in their maiden attempt for the coveted recognition. India has also bagged the third best award for ‘best practices’ on pollution control in the coastal regions. This is out of 50 Blue Flag nations, to which India now belongs.

“It is one more feather in the cap of Visakhapatnam and the city will now be on the international tourism map. International tourists prefer to visit beaches with the Blue Flag tag as they meet all the international norms of safety, cleanliness and provide amenities matching international standards,” Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao told The Hindu on Sunday evening.

The ‘Blue Flag’ certification is given by the Denmark-based Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE). Rushikonda Beach is the only one beach in the State, which was selected by the Union government, for development to match international standards, under BEAMS (Beach Environment and Aesthetics Management Services) project.

“The Rushikonda Beach was nominated for the project in 2017 and it was finalised in February, 2018. Outdoor fitness equipment, machinery for continuous beach cleaning, safety equipment like CCTV cameras and lifeguards were all provided as part of the project,” R. Purnima Devi, District Tourism Officer and Nodal Officer for the Blue Flag Project, told The Hindu.

It may be recalled that the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Mo EFCC) announced at a virtual event in September this year that for the first time eight beaches of India were recommended for the Blue Flag certification.

The basic criteria for getting the certification are: safety/security, pollution-free, good bathing water quality and environmental education of beach users. A Blue Flag beach should have benches for tourists to relax, showers to enable them take a bath after a dip, a gymnasium and proper solid waste disposal systems among other things.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/9iwl4f/article32829440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-VZ-RUSHIKONDABEACH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rushikonda-beach-gets-eco-label-blue-flag/article32829441.ece

At a meeting here to discuss the strategies for COVID-19 management and the preventive measures during the ensuing Dasara festivities, he said the hospitals across Mysuru should set aside more beds for COVID-19 patients and directed his department officials to ensure patients do not face shortage of beds.

With the spike in mortality rate in Mysuru, the emphasis should be on controlling deaths, he said, adding that a death audit was being made to ascertain the reasons for the spurt in fatalities.

In view of spike in infections and deaths, the hospitals must ensure all drugs were available and there was no short supply. If necessary, important drugs can be warehoused so that no patient was inconvenienced, Dr. Sudhakar said and added that home isolated patients need to be monitored suitably. If required, such patients should be shifted to hospitals for monitoring.

During the same period, while Chennai reduced active cases from 22,781 to 11,323, Mumbai brought down its active cases from 29,715 to 26,663, according to an analysis by Project: Jeevan Raksha, an initiative of Proxima, a management consulting firm, that is technically supported by Public Health Foundation of India and Indian Medical Association.

Mysore Sanjeev, convener of Jeevan Raksha, said Bengaluru’s performance in terms of COVID-19 management is relatively deteriorating over the last few weeks when compared with other mega cities.

“Despite testing 7.7 lakh samples during the last 30 days, the city’s Moving Growth Rate (MGR) of active cases as well as deaths is highest amongst all the six mega cities. This indicates that Bengaluru is having the shortest doubling period for both critical parameters. If the same pattern continues for another few weeks, we are worried more lives will be in danger,” he said.

‘Infections multiplying’

C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said controlling the spread has become difficult as the infections are multiplying at community level.

“Most people would have had contact with an infected person, either primary or secondary. But they may not be aware if the source patient is asymptomatic. As a result, without their knowledge some people are further spreading the infection to others. Getting tested without any delay and availing timely treatment is most important. Those who need hospitalisation should be allotted beds without any delay,” he said.

“At 1.4% although our cumulative Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is reasonably under control, it is desirable to keep this below 1%,” Dr. Manjunath added. As on Monday, the State’s CFR stood at 0.92%.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cy8odv/article32837767.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGCOVIDTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/active-cases-increase-by-59-in-last-30-days-in-bengaluru/article32837753.ece
88,2020/10/12,128 railway stations under SWR harness solar power,"They saved ₹1.78 crore in power charges last year

The South Western Railway generated 4.4 million units of power harnessing solar energy last fiscal that resulted in saving ₹1.78 crore in electricity charges.

The emphasis on harnessing solar power has led to installation of rooftop solar plants at 128 railway stations across the zone over the last few years.

The thrust on solar power is part of the Indian Railways plan to source about 1,000 mega watt (MW) of solar power and about 200 MW of wind power progressively by 2021-22 across all zonal railways and production units.

A release said out of the proposed 1,000 MW, 500 MW will be harnessed through solar plants which are being installed on the rooftop of railway buildings and will be used to meet non-traction loads and other operations at railway stations. Another 500 MW harnessed from land-based solar plants will be used to meet both traction and non-traction requirements, according to the officials.

The South Western Zone has provided rooftop solar solutions at 128 railway stations, including Hubballi, KSR Bengaluru, Mysuru, Yeshwantpur, Hospet, Gadag and Ballari. It has also covered seven service buildings such as Rail Soudha ‘West & Central Wing’, Divisional Railway Manager’s Office at Hubballi, Railway Hospital at Hubballi, Divisional Railway Manager’s Office at Bengaluru, Parcel Office and Railway Hospital at Bengaluru, and at the Divisional Railway Manager’s Office at Mysuru.

The workshops and sheds have also been provided with solar rooftop plants and in addition 221 level crossings are operating on electricity provided by solar photo voltaic cell lights. “The solar electricity generation last year was 4.4 million units, which is expected to increase to the tune of 4.664 million units this year subject to sunny days and insulation,” said the release.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iar2ix/article32837740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGSOLAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/128-railway-stations-under-swr-harness-solar-power/article32837741.ece

Deputy Commissioner of Police Vikram Amate said on Monday that the accused Shivanand Wali had confessed to cheating the family of assets, money and other valuables.

The “astrologer” had convinced Mr. Kalyan’s wife and parents-in-law that they had to give up all movable and immovable properties to live a peaceful life. He had connived, along with their cook Ganga Kulkarni, and transferred money, vehicles, land, buildings and jewellery to himself.

The High Court of Karnataka on Monday stayed further constructions at the famous Sri Renuka Yellamma temple of Saundatti in Belagavi district for allegedly violating provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the interim orders on a PIL petition filed by Mahendragouda of Bailahongal in Belagavi district.

It has been pointed out in the petition that documents obtained under the Right to Information Act have revealed that a showcause notice was issued in March 2020 to the executive officer of the temple by the Superintending Archaeologist, Archaeological Survey of India, Dharwad Circle, for carrying out the constructions without obtaining a no-objection certificate from the competent authority.

Notice to temple

The notice issued to the temple clearly states that the Vijayanagara inscription of Krishnadevaraya in the temple is a protected monument and as per Section 20-A of the Act, and the illegal construction being put up on south-west side of the temple should have been stopped within 15 days from the date of the show-cause notice. However, the construction activities are still going on, the petitioner alleged.

RTI information

While pointing out that the information provided under the Right to Information Act by the State’s Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage, Mysuru, states that Sri Renuka Yellamma Temple itself is a State Protected Monument, the petitioner has contended that the constructions taken up by the temple management were contrary to the laws.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/as8ts1/article32837726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-stays-construction-at-saundatti-renuka-yellamma-temple/article32837727.ece

Scores of men and women led by office-bearers of various Dalit and progressive organisations took out a protest march in Hubballi on Monday seeking justice for the family of the young woman who is said to have been raped and murdered at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh.

The Congress extended support to the agitation which was organised by a federation of various Dalit associations and organisations. The protestors first gathered in front of the Ambedkar statue near the Head Post Office in Hubballi before launching the protest march.

Waving flags of their organisations and placards seeking severe punishment to the accused in the case, the protestors marched to the Mini Vidhana Soudha, which houses the Huballi Tahsildar’s office.

As the number of protestors was large, the police blocked the roads leading to Kittur Chennamma Circle and diverted vehicular traffic through alternative routes.

The protestors covered Lamington Road, Brindavan Circle, Kittur Chennamma Circle and Court Circle before reaching the tahsildar’s office.

At Kittur Chennamma Circle, they staged a demonstration for a short while and later at the Mini Vidhana Soudha too. Speakers, including Hubballi Dharwad East MLA Prasad Abbayya, State president of Samata Sena Gurunath Ullikashi, president of Dalit Sena M. Arvind and others, who addressed the protestors, condemned the Hathras incident in strong words and sought severe punishment for the accused.

They said that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, which made tall claims about providing protection to women, had behaved in an irresponsible manner and had been apathetic towards the plea of the victim’s family. The Uttar Pradesh government, led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, had, in fact, tried to snub the protesting organisations and media persons who had raised their voice for justice.

Congress leaders Altaf Halwoor, Shakir Sanadi, Babajan Mudhol, Rajashekhar Menasinakai, Mohan Hiremani, Nagaraj Gouri, office-bearers of Anjuman-e-Islam Yousuf Savanur, Altaf Kittur and office-bearers of various Dalit and progressive organisations were part of the agitation.

The Social Welfare portfolio was with Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Sudhakar said the Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education Departments in the State have independent Ministers, but the departments at the Centre and in most States have one Minister.

Mysuru is one of the 113 cities registered for the Streets for People Challenge, an initiative of Smart Cities Mission, Government of India.

The India Programme of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), which is the knowledge partner of the Smart Cities Mission, is conducting this Challenge and guiding cities through it.

The registered cities will implement quick, innovative, and low-cost interventions to make their cities walkable, with a focus on place making and liveability.

“Promoting pedestrian movement in urban streets promotes public health, cleaner air, better public mobility and is environmentally-friendly. It will ease congestion and traffic and pave the way for a sustainable city. I request active citizen participation in creating safer streets and support Mysuru in the Challenge,” said Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde.

Community engagement is a key component of the Challenge, and its success depends on active coordination between the city and its citizens. To ensure this transformation, Mysuru is committed to working with its citizens as it develops and implements the proposals, a release said here.

The Challenge pushes cities to reimagine their streets as public spaces through the lens of economic regeneration, safety, and child-friendly interventions, in order to ensure a green recovery from COVID-19, according to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

What’s the Challenge?

The Challenge comprises two stages: in Stage 1 that runs until February 2021, each city has to identify and test at least one flagship walking project and enhance liveability in one neighbourhood. The potential locations for the flagship project may include streets and public spaces around transit hubs, heritage zones, commercial streets, market areas, recreational corridors, or any zone with high footfall.

A city-led design competition will form an integral component of the Challenge to gather innovative ideas from professionals across the country as the Challenge considers participatory approach as its core value.

11 cities to get nod

The Mission will shortlist 11 cities, through a reputed panel of experts, which would then move to Stage 2 of the Challenge. The evaluation will be based on the pilots and conceptual city-wide scale-up proposals submitted by the registered cities. The shortlisted cities will receive an award, a citation, and guidance from national and international experts to further develop and commence their scale-up plans submitted in Stage 1. This stage will extend until May 2021, the release said.

During the course of the Challenge, cities will receive assistance through online training workshops, knowledge resources, peer-to-peer learning discussions with fellow cities, and interactions with local civil society organisations (CSOs) and design experts to strategise and implement pilots, while also developing their scale-up proposal.

The Challenge, the release said, has launched an online portal that features a page exclusively for this purpose titled ‘Support your city’. By filling the form on this page, interested citizens, CSOs, students, consultants, and corporates can express their interest in working with the city for the Challenge. Using this portal, Mysuru will review the entries and form a diverse team that will support in developing and implementing the initiatives.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/oqgi38/article32833507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bg-mys-smart,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-takes-up-challenge-to-build-pedestrian-friendly-safe-streets/article32833448.ece

“He was healthy and taking music classes online as well. He suffered from indigestion for the last two days and passed away at our home at 11:00 p.m. on Sunday,” his son R. Ananth Kumar told The Hindu.

Hailing from Mysuru, brothers Rajan and Nagendra debuted as music directors in 1952 with the Kannada film Soubhagya Lakshmi, and went on to have a very successful career for nearly four decades.

The brothers were fondly referred to as Kalyanji-Anandji of Kannada cinema. Nagendra died in 2000 at the age of 65.

Rajan’s death has brought an end to a glorious era of Kannada cinema music.

105,2020/10/12,Aspirants for bypolls in Belagavi LS segment more in BJP,"BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel toured the district to meet taluk-level leaders and heads of different morchas on Saturday and Sunday

Election Commission of India is yet to announce a byelection to the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat that fell vacant after the death of the former Union Minister Suresh Angadi. Political developments related to the bypoll, however, have begun in the district. The earliest trends suggest that the number of aspirants in the BJP outnumber those in the Congress or the Janata Dal(S).

BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel toured the district to meet taluk-level leaders and heads of different morchas on Saturday and Sunday.

However, he told journalists in Belagavi on Saturday that the party would focus on the bypoll only after the ECI announcement.

This is the second time since Angadi’s death that Mr. Kateel is visiting Belagavi. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi also held a meeting of party office-bearers a week ago.

Angadi’s followers and relatives have demanded that the party nominate either his wife or one of his daughters in the elections.

His uncle Lingaraj Patil urged Mr. Kateel to honour Angadi’s memory by giving party ticket to one of his family members.

This is apart from the sympathy factor, he reminded Mr. Kateel. Some in the BJP feel that a Lingayat Banajiga leader should fill the slot held by Angadi in Parliament and if possible, in the Union Council of Ministers.

KLE Society chairman Prabhakar Kore, a member of the Banajiga community, met Mr. Kateel on Saturday and told journalists that he had not retired from politics yet. The former Rajya Sabha member joined the BJP in 2008 after spending decades in the Congress. His Rajya Sabha membership was not renewed when the BJP chose a Sangh Parivar favourite Eeranna Kadadi over him this year.

Lingayat Panchamshali community leaders, including Jaya Mrutyunjay Swami, have demanded that the party nominate a leader from the community if Angadi’s family did not get party ticket.

This would help leaders, including Shankargouda Patil, State’s representative in New Delhi, MLA V.I. Patil, Raju Chikkangoudar, Ravi Patil and Mahantesh Doddagoudar, say party workers.

Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has spoken to some leaders about fielding his son and KMF director Amarnath Jarkiholi, said one BJP leader. If a Jarkiholi family member gets party ticket, the brothers will work together despite party differences, he said. Mr. Kateel meeting the former MP Amarsinh Patil in Raibag on Sunday led to speculation that the BJP may be planning to field the leader from the Kuruba community to strengthen the backward class vote base in North Karnataka.

The few names doing the rounds in the Congress are that of the former MP Prakash Hukkeri and MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar.

The party could also ask MLAs Satish Jarkiholi or Mahantesh Koujalgi to fight the polls, said a Congress leader.

However, there are not many seeking party nomination. No meeting has been held over this issue at the State or district level till now, he said.

The Janata Dal(S) is yet to see bypoll-related activity, members say. “We are waiting for instructions from senior leaders about the polls. We will choose the best candidate among us and give a proper fight,’’ says Ashfaq Madaki, who fought the Assembly polls unsuccessfully last time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uxlxz8/article32829920.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGBELAGAVIANGADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/aspirants-for-bypolls-in-belagavi-ls-segment-more-in-bjp/article32829922.ece

Speaking to presspersons after offering bagina to Dorasamudra tank that had filled up following the rains this year, on Saturday, the Minister said he would discuss the project with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to get funds sanctioned. The project was announced by the H.D. Kumaraswamy-led coalition government.

Mr. Gopalaiah, who is also minister in-charge of the district, said that the State government would prioritize developmental projects. “The government will not play politics on the issue of works that benefit the farming community,” he said.

K.S. Lingesh of the JD(S), Belur MLA, said the project was stuck. Once the project was implemented, Dorasamudra tank would get water so that farmers in the area would benefit. “The State government should provide funds for the project and implement it at the earliest,” he said.

Barbs continued to be traded between Janata Dal (S) and Congress leaders on Sunday, with former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy calling the Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah the “biggest liar of the century”.

“Siddaramaiah has said that he had discussed with the JD(S) the matter of support to the Congress when the motion of no confidence was moved. He has also said that the sons of soil did not support. This is a blatant lie and Mr. Siddaramaiah has proved himself to be the biggest liar of the century,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said in a series of tweets.

In another tweet, he said, “In the last century, a former Congress Chief Minister had been termed a big liar. Mr. Siddaramaiah has snatched that title.” He added that Mr. Siddaramaiah, without holding any discussions with the JD(S), was lying through his teeth and should stop doing so at least now. “While I am accused of playing caste politics during elections, what is Mr. Siddaramaiah [doing]? The land knows that he wears the AHINDA mask and is a fake socialist,” he tweeted.

Meanwhile, JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda accused the Congress of indulging in caste politics in Rajarajeshwarinagar.

111,2020/10/12,PFA cracks down on illegal dog breeding in Mysuru,"Advocates adoption of stray dogs

People For Animals (PFA) in Mysuru is cracking down on illegal dog breeders in the city owing to high rates of animal abuse.

The PFA located an illegal backyard dog breeder at Udbur on the outskirts of the city with the help of the local animal welfare officials and the police. It rescued 6 of 18 dogs and sent them to the Woof Wagon Pet Resort for rehabilitation. The rescued dogs are being monitored by the Woof Wagon veterinarians for any ailments. Some were in a miserable condition.

The release said various pedigree breeds like German Shepherds, Dobermans, Huskies, Retrievers and Labradors were found housed in small metal cages. The PFA said as per the general regulations related to dog breeding in India, it was mandatory for the dog breeder to register with the State Animal Welfare Board of their respective States. In this case the dog breeder had no registration and hence it was illegal.

The release cited the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Dog Breeding and Marketing) Rules, 2017, as per which mutilation of ears is banned and yet two Dobermans were found with their ears cropped and tails docked. The entire process took three days to complete due to legal restrictions by when the breeder had moved other dogs to an undisclosed location and hence these could not be rescued, the release said.

Underlining the cruelty involved, the PFA said dogs are forced to breed consecutively through their heat cycles without a pause and this leads to ovarian and uterine tumours. Once the breeder realizes that they cannot profit from a dog, it is abandoned on the streets. PFA has rescued more than 100 breed dogs that were abandoned on streets by breeders this year alone, the release added.

Advocating the need to adopt Indian street dogs, the PFA said they are not inferior to the pedigree breeds and were more sturdy and resistant to infections. This will also help reduce the population of street dogs and help the community at large, it added. In addition, pedigree dogs such as Alaskan Malamutes, Siberian Huskies and Saint Bernards are adapted to low-temperature environments but are brought to warmer tropical climates and made to suffer, it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/h3tmuu/article32829636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGMYSURU3STRAYS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pfa-cracks-down-on-illegal-dog-breeding-in-mysuru/article32829637.ece

113,2020/10/12,Mahisha Dasara to be restricted to floral tributes this year,"In view of COVID-19, the celebration of Mahisha Dasara will be restricted to offering floral tributes to the statue of Mahishasura atop Chamundi Hills on October 15.

Briefing reporters on Sunday, former Mayor of Mysuru Purshothama said the Mahisha Dasara Organising Committee had sought permission to celebrate Mahisha Dasara to remember the forgotten pride of ancient Mysuru.

The Organizing Committee of Mahisha Dasara had written to the previous Deputy Commissioner B. Sharat as well as the present Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, besides City Police Commissioner Chandragupta seeking permission to observe Mahisha Dasara on October 15.

“We were confident of receiving permission for the celebration in line with our constitutional and democratic rights,” Mr. Purushothama said adding that the celebrations will be restricted to offering floral tributes. “There will be no stage or any public function in view of COVID-19. The gathering will also be restricted to the number of people permitted by the District Administration and the Health Department officials,” he said.

Mr. Purushotham said they have been celebrating Mahisha Dasara for the last seven years including last year when it was opposed and the event atop Chamundi Hills was cancelled.

“But, we held the programme at Ambedkar Park in Ashokapuram last year and later took out a procession through several streets of the city,” he said.

Meanwhile, writer K.S. Bhagwan, who was also present at the briefing, regretted that Mahishasura had been depicted as an evil person. On the contrary, Mahishasura was an ideal ruler of the then Mysuru region, who followed Buddhism. The region was first called Mahisha Mandala before it became Mahishapura and eventually Mysuru, Prof. Bhagwan said, before wondering why anybody would name Mysuru after Mahishasura if he were evil.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6suvu3/article32829621.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGMYSURU3MAHISHADASARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mahisha-dasara-to-be-restricted-to-floral-tributes-this-year/article32829622.ece
114,2020/10/12,Kuruba leaders prepare road map for campaign to seek ST tag for community,"In a bid to exert pressure on both the State and Union governments to accord Scheduled Tribe (ST) tag to the Kuruba community, a congregation of religious heads and Kuruba leaders from all parties on Sunday resolved to intensify the fight for ST tag for Kurubas by announcing a road map for the movement that includes a padayatra, taking a delegation to Delhi, and a massive rally over the next few months.

While it was decided that regional conventions would be held in Belagavi, Mysuru, Bengaluru, and Kalaburgi on various dates from November 2020 to January 2021, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa will lead a delegation to Delhi to meet the Central leaders. The four seers of the Kuruba community will launch a padayatra from Kaginele on January 15, 2021, and it will culminate in Bengaluru on February 7, where a massive rally will be organised, Kaginele Seer Sri Niranjananada Swami announced.

“The struggle will continue till Kurubas get ST tag. Despite a demand for ST tag since 1935, it has so far not bore fruit. I will fight by approaching Home Minister Amit Shah and other Union Ministers to secure the ST tag,” Mr. Eshwarappa, who is spearheading the current movement, said at the event at Palace Grounds here.

Meanwhile, MLC N. Nagaraj (MTB), who was among the 17 Congress and JD(S) legislators who resigned to cause the fall of the H.D. Kumaraswamy government last year, said it was because of the sacrifice of Kuruba legislators, including him, A.H. Vishwanath, Byrathi Basavaraj, and R. Shankar, that the BJP government could be formed and B.S. Yediyurappa could become Chief Minister. “Because of the sacrifice, the demand for ST tag of Kurubas should be considered,” he said.

Deputy leader of JD(S) Legislature Party Bandeppa Kashempur said that the Gonds, Jenu Kuruba, and Kadu Kurubas were getting the ST tag in a few districts, while the larger Kuruba population in the State had been denied this. There is no political agenda behind this demand, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kuruba-leaders-prepare-road-map-for-campaign-to-seek-st-tag-for-community/article32829595.ece

116,2020/10/12,Bypolls: Parties banking on social media to reach out to voters,"COVID-19 norms come in the way of regular campaigning

The byelections to Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar, scheduled for November 3, could see political parties ramp up their social media presence to reach out to voters amid the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. With social distancing and restrictions on forming groups in place, the parties are also cautious about their leaders contracting the virus over the next 20 days as election fever rises.

WhatsApp is being seen as a preferred platform to reach out to voters at the booth level, and all the three parties are looking at using this medium to reach out through booth-level volunteers. Facebook and Twitter, though, will be used by the parties to reach out to the more savvy voters and with a larger message. In the mostly rural Sira constituency, Facebook is being seen as not of much help, while in R.R. Nagar it could help the parties connect to a bigger urban audience.

“These elections will definitely pose a challenge to the parties involved in electioneering during the pandemic. We are going to use more of social media, especially WhatsApp, to reach out to voters. WhatsApp groups have been formed at the booth level, and party messages will be pushed into these groups, which in turn will forward these messages to the voters,” said BJP spokesman N. Ravikumar. “We can reach the voters directly through WhatsApp and almost instantly. At least about 50% of our canvassing will be done through WhatAapp, while the traditional house-to-house campaigning will also be there,” he said.

JD(S) strategy

The Janata Dal (S), which is traditionally seen as a “not-so tech-savvy” party, is also using WhatsApp to reach out to the maximum number of voters, and has even trained some of its WhatsApp administrators on the kinds of messages to be forwarded to those outside the party’s voter base. “We have told them strictly to forward those messages that speak about the performance and achievements of the JD(S) and not to criticise other parties or leaders. We are also pushing such messages of H.D. Kumaraswamy’s achievements,” said JD(S) social media coordinator Naveen C. Gowda. On the matter of preferring the platform of WhatsApp, he said, “We have seen that most people who are on Facebook are those who are fans or followers of a particular leader or party. Approaching through Facebook will be limited,” he said.

The Congress is learnt to have ramped up its social media team after the oath-taking ceremony of D.K. Shivakumar as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president saw an overall imprint of about 1.4 crore across social media platforms. “This is also his first election and he has realised the importance of reaching out to voters through online platforms. Booth-level workers are now part of this social media outreach, and Zoom meetings have become common to strategise with the local leaders,” a Congress source said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/261x33/article32829512.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12SOCIALMEDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bypolls-parties-banking-on-social-media-to-reach-out-to-voters/article32829513.ece

For the first time after the case graph of the third wave of COVID-19 epidemic began to climb, Kerala reported more recoveries than new cases on Monday. However, the dip in cases was because of the dip in testing by nearly half the number of samples, which has been a regular phenomenon following a weekend.

The test positivity is still high at 15.4%. When 38,259 samples were tested in the past 24 hours, Kerala reported 5,930 new cases, while the recoveries on the day were 7,836.

The cumulative case burden of the State is steadily inching towards the three lakh mark and now stands at 2,95,132 cases.

Total recoveries till date being 1,99,634, the number of patients currently undergoing treatment in State’s hospitals has reached 94,388.

Of the active cases, 658 are critically ill and occupying ICUs while 176 are on ventilator support.

The State’s toll now stands at 1,025, after 22 more deaths in the past few weeks were added on to the official list of COVID deaths. Thiruvananthapuram and Kannur reported six deaths each, Kozhikode four, Ernakulam three, Alappuzha two, and one each in Kollam and Idukki.

The Health Department has decided to make COVID-19 testing more accessible to the public by promoting testing kiosks at airports, railway stations, border areas, and other public places such as transit points like shopping malls and at various points on the way to Sabarimala.

There are 1,293 COVID-19 testing facilities in both public and private facilities.

Though the government has been looking to the private sector to ramp up COVID-19 testing and made testing-on-demand possible by doing away with medical prescriptions, testing has been limited in the private sector.

There are many factors, including fear of stigma as well as fear that they will be forcefully removed to COVID first-line treatment centres, that have been preventing people from voluntarily testing themselves.

The COVID-19 Screening, Testing, Education and Prevention (STEP) kiosks can be set up by any State-approved or ICMR-approved private labs or hospital development societies of government hospitals, after prior intimation to the District Medical Officer.

All kiosks will have to be registered on the Health Department’s portal for lab information, as per guidelines.

The kiosks will educate people on COVID prevention by providing information on the use of masks and other means of precautions and offer screening for symptoms such as fever using a flash thermometer. There will also be facility to test for anosmia.

The kiosks will open rapid antigen assay for COVID-19 at rates fixed by the government. Good quality masks and sanitisers will be available for sale at the kiosks.

The Health Department has directed that these kiosks should have visibility and be set up in places easily accessible to people. The knock-down kiosks should be set up in well ventilated places with provision for a waiting area so that crowding does not happen.

The DMOs have been given the job of monitoring these kiosks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-testing-to-be-more-accessible/article32837925.ece
120,2020/10/12,"Commissioner seeks enhanced security for Sabarimala, Pampa","Report calls notifying these locations as special security zones all-round the year

Amidst protests over two motorcycle borne youths trespassing on to the trek route to Sabarimala from Pampa last month, the Sabarimala Special Commissioner has sought to notify these locations as special security zones all-round the year.

In his report to the Kerala High Court, M. Manoj, Sabarimala Special Commissioner and district judge, submitted that the incident pointed to security lapses at Sabarimala, Nilackal, and Pampa, marked as special security zones during the annual pilgrimage season. He sought to notify Pampa and Sabarimala as special security zones under Section 83 of the Kerala Police Act all-round the year.

He also requested for directives to the State Police Chief for investigating security lapses at the Pampa guard room and the forest check-post that resulted in the trespass.

The report says there is no proper system to verify the goods being transported in tractors to the Sannidhanam. Hence, the possibility of miscreants transporting hazardous and prohibited articles to the Sannidhanam cannot be ruled out.

“It is an eye-opener for the guards of the Forest Department, Travancore Devaswom Board, and the Kerala Police to be more vigilant. The possibility of miscreants trespassing to the Sabarimala Sannidhanam to commit clandestine operations cannot be ruled out if security is not vigilant and alert,” it says.

The report calls for directives for a joint check-post of the Police and the Forest Departments with a guard room facility, barricades, and CCTV network ahead of the Triveni bridge at Pampa-Triveni. Only vehicles of constitutional dignitaries, melsanthis, TDB, and other departments shall be permitted beyond the bridge after verification.

It also calls for a loading point at Pampa with CCTV network, under surveillance of the Police and the Forest Departments, from where goods are loaded into tractors to the Sannidhanam.

Two youths from Chittar in Pathanamthitta, identified as Sreejith and Jibin Varghese, on a motorcycle had bypassed the forest check-post and the TDB guard room near Pampa Ganapathy Temple and trespassed into Swami Ayyappan Road on September 26 evening. They, however, were intercepted by forest officials at Paramada on Chandrananden Road. They were booked under Section 27(1) e (IV) 252 of the Kerala Forest Act and released on bail.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xfl2ci/article32788364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SABARI-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/commissioner-seeks-enhanced-security-for-sabarimala-pampa/article32836736.ece
121,2020/10/12,"Legal battle over, MT gets Randamoozham script back","Writer returns advance of ₹1.25 cr. to Shrikumar Menon

The screenplay of Randamoozham is finally back where it belongs. M.T. Vasudevan Nair, who has adapted his classic novel for the screen, has been handed over the script by director V.A. Shrikumar Menon.

The two-year legal battle, which began at the munsiff court here and reached the Supreme Court, is over. The munsiff court has passed the order following a joint statement from M.T. and Mr. Menon.

M.T. has also returned the advance of ₹1.25 crore to the director. Mr. Menon, according to the clauses in the settlement, cannot make a film with Bheema as the central character. M.T. is now free to work with any director for the screen adaptation of Randamoozham, a retelling of Mahabharata from Bheema’s viewpoint.

“The process to turn Randamoozham into a film is already on,” Aswathy Srikanth, M.T.’s daughter who has been looking after the case, told The Hindu. “Because of COVID-19, it may take longer than usual to finalise the project, but we hope it would happen soon.”

K.B. Sivaramakrishnan, the lawyer who appeared for M.T. at the munsiff and Supreme courts, said he was happy that the legal battle could be settled within two years. “A case like this could have gone on for many years and we are all glad that the judicial system acted fast,” he said. “It is indeed gratifying that the whole issue is resolved and that Randamoozham could finally happen. But it is saddening that V.V. Narayanan, the High Court lawyer who worked with me for the case, passed away before the final verdict came.”

The plan

It was in April, 2017, that Mr. Menon had announced that Randamoozham would be made in several languages, including Malayalam, English and Hindi, at a cost of ₹1,000 crore.

He had also said that it would be produced by UAE-based entrepreneur B.R. Shetty, who has since run into financial, legal troubles.

The film was expected to be released in two parts in 2020. But, when the film’s shoot did not begin within the time agreed upon in the contract, M.T. approached the court to get the script back.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2sp351/article32840165.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TVVASUDEVANNAIR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/legal-battle-over-mt-gets-randamoozham-script-back/article32836516.ece

123,2020/10/12,CM launches work on A-C road,"189 roads constructed at ₹1,451 crore across the State to be opened to traffic in 3 months

The State has made great strides in the public transport sector, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

He was virtually inaugurating the reconstruction work of the Alappuzha-Changanassery (AC) road on Monday. “The State has witnessed big changes in the public transport system. The government has made 98% of roads in the State motorable. A total of 5,000 roads have been reconstructed under the Chief Minister's Local Road Rebuild Project. Besides, ₹14, 864 crore is being spent for the renovation of various roads in the State. The government has spent ₹1,883 crore for reconstructing roads damaged in flood in recent years. Roads being built utilising ₹950 crore from NABARD are in the final phase of construction,” Mr. Vijayan said.

The Chief Minister said that 189 roads constructed at a cost of ₹1,451 crore across the State would be opened to traffic in three months.

The 24.14-km AC road will be reconstructed as a semi-elevated highway at a cost of ₹671.66 crore. The project, which is expected to prevent flooding of the road during the monsoon season, will be completed in three years.

As part of the project, 2.9 km of the road will be refurbished using bituminous macadam bituminous concrete (BMBC) method. Using geotextiles, 8.27 km will be strengthened. Another 9 km of the road will be reconstructed with geogrid and geotextiles encased stone column.

Five flyovers will be constructed at places prone to severe flooding. The flyovers will come up between the Onnamkara bridge and Mankombu Junction, Mankombu Junction and Mankombu culvert, Jyothi Junction and Parasseril bridge, Ponga culvert and Pandarakulam, and near Mankombu Thekkekara.

Besides, three existing bridges at Kidangara, Nedumudi and Pallathuruthy will be widened. The Muttar bridge across the AC canal will be reconstructed. Apart from these, construction of nine causeways, 13 minor bridges, drains, ducts, retaining walls, culverts, bus shelters, and road safety features are also planned.

The two-lane road and flyovers with footpaths will have a width between 13 and 14 meters. The work will be carried out by the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society.

125,2020/10/12,Houseboats to take to open,"No tourist rush on Monday, the first day of resumption of the services

When the COVID-19 pandemic started to wreak havoc across the globe earlier this year, the houseboat sector was one of the first to come to a grinding halt. Now, after a seven-month pause, the sector is among the last to resume operations.

On Monday, the first day of resumption of houseboat services, there was no jostling of vessels or rush of tourists in Alappuzha, a major backwater destination. Only a couple of boats, carrying a small number of domestic tourists following COVID-19 protocols, chugged along the palm-fronted backwaters of Alappuzha. Majority of the houseboats will only resume services in the next couple of days after completing the cleaning and maintenance of the vessels.

Houseboat owners, who are struggling to stay afloat after COVID-19 blew a hole in the sector, have welcomed the government decision allowing boat operations adhering to COVID-19 protocols. “It is the first step on the long road to normalisation. All arrangements are in place to welcome tourists. However, with the COVID-19 graph continuing to climb, we are not expecting tourists to come in hordes any time soon. There are hardly any bookings or enquiries at present. Opening the sector is a positive move, but the government should also take steps to promote the destination,” says Kevin Rozario, general secretary, All Kerala Houseboat Owners and Operators Samiti.

Mr. Kevin has urged the government to extend the moratorium on banks loans to one year and release the maintenance grant to houseboats at the earliest.

Earlier, after the pandemic severely hit the business, several houseboat owners and employees turned to other jobs to make a living. Vinod V., president, All Kerala Houseboat Owners Association, says it will take at least another six months to achieve some sort of normalcy in the sector. “Given the pandemic situation, we are not going to get many trips as tourist flow will be minimal. As such the government should extend the soon-to-be-expiring survey, fitness registration and other certificates of the boats,” he says.

Resuming houseboat operations are expected to provide an impetus to the entire backwater tourism sector. M. Malin, secretary, District Tourism Promotion Council says the COVID-19 protocols will be strictly followed. As part of it, check-in will be allowed only from Punnamada finishing point and Pallathuruthy houseboat terminals. As per the guidelines, a maximum of 100 tourists who follow COVID-19 protocol will be allowed in terminals at a time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/houseboats-to-take-to-open/article32836432.ece
126,2020/10/12,New facility for start-ups at MGU to begin,"Students Amenities-cum-Incubation Centre is a ₹4.53-crore project

The first phase of the Students Amenities-cum-Incubation Centre set up by the Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, is slated to begin operations on October 27.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the centre at a function to be presided over by Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel. The first phase of the facility, which intends to promote start-up initiatives and student amenities, was initiated under the Rashtriya Uchtar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) project of the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development.

Of the ₹4.53 crore expended on the project, about 40% of the cost was borne by the State government. The building, having a built-up area of 14,131 sq.ft, was constructed by the Kerala Electrical and Allied Engineering Company Limited (KEL).

According to varsity officials, the predominant objective of the centre is to develop a business innovation ecosystem consisting several incubators. The student entrepreneurs will be also offered training programmes in collaboration with University of Wisconsin, USA, and Fortune 500 companies, and other start-up support services.

The incubators, which will come up in this building under the second phase of RUSA scheme, are Nanotechnology incubator and App Factory, and digital services incubator. It will provide students and young innovators, amenities for establishing start-ups.

The App Factory and digital services incubator at the centre will facilitate common amenities for start-ups in areas like Mobile and Web App Development, Artificial Intelligence and Bots, Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), Single Page Application, Motion UI, Block chain Technology, Internet of Things, and Business Analytics. It will also have Scientific Core Cloud Computing facilities, which will empower small scale industries, universities and colleges in modelling and computation to boost their research and reduce the time taken to develop it into products.

The Digital Learning and Empowering Studio at the Centre will house a wide range of facilities, which will promote technology-oriented teaching, learning and content creation services.

The Nanotechnology incubator will house facilities for Nano cellulose research and pilot plant for production of Micro cellulose (MCC). It will also have facilities for development of Nano cellulose-modified value-added products in the areas of food supplements and nutraceuticals.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/new-facility-for-start-ups-at-mgu-to-begin/article32836408.ece
127,2020/10/12,Opening tourism brings hope in Munnar,"With the opening of tourism centres from Monday, the sector hopes to come out of its pandemic-induced lull.

Hundreds of people depend on tourism in Munnar, one of the chosen destinations in the district. The move to slowly open the sector has come as a relief to them as well as the other stakeholders. A staff at a resort at Munnar says there is no booking at present but it might pick up in the coming winter season.

Job J. Neryamparambi, range officer of the Eravikulam National Park (ENP), says only 10 persons visited Rajamala, the natural habitat of Nilgiri tahr and the main destination in Munnar, on Monday. This could be because the town is in the containment zone, he says.

The ENP remained closed from January 20 after it was shut for the calving season of the Nilgiri tahr. It was reopened on August 19 when an average of 100 visitors came there per day. Mr Job says the sightings of Nilgiri tahr are high in Rajamala now.

As many as 2,300 persons solely depend on the tourism activities under the Forest Department in Munnar. They were thrown out of work after the pandemic hit. In the ENP alone, an average of ₹40 lakh is needed to run the tourism activities per month. A large amount of it goes to daily wage earners as their pay.

Such emergencies are usually met with the funds kept in reserve. This is slowly drying up, an official at the ENP says, highlighting the need to open the tourism activities. There are a number of tribespeople who work in the tourism sector under the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR). They are also facing the same situation as at the ENP.

The economic activities in Kumily depend largely on the tourism activities at Thekkady. Though tourism activities were opened here by August end, only 17 tourists turned up for the boat ride on the lake.

Krishnaraj, a native of Munnar, say visitors might start coming from Tuesday. The lesser-known tourism destinations of Ramakkalmedu and Wagamon saw only low turnout of tourists on Monday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/opening-tourism-brings-hope-in-munnar/article32836244.ece

Actor Parvathy Thiruvothu on Monday resigned from the Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA), in protest against the comments made by its general secretary Edavela Babu in a media interview. When asked whether actor Bhavana would be included in a movie that the AMMA was planning to make, Mr. Babu had said, “She is not in AMMA anymore. We cannot bring back the dead.”

Also read: Supreme Court refuses to stay trial against actor Dileep

“His utterly disgusting and mortifying remark comparing a woman member who had been badly let down by this organisation and consequently left it, to a dead person is beyond correction. Mr. Babu may believe he just used a metaphor, but it shows his nauseating attitude and I pity him. I am sure that when the media starts discussing this remark, many of his peers will support him. I am certain about this because of the way they have always dealt with issues pertaining to women,” said Parvathy in a facebook post announcing her resignation.

Stayed back in 2018

In July 2018, four members of the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), including an actor who was allegedly abducted and sexually assaulted, had resigned from AMMA, in protest against the organisation’s decision to reinstate actor Dileep, who was ousted from the organisation after he was named an accused in the abduction and sexual assault case. Parvathy was one of the WCC members who remained in AMMA to continue the fight from within.

“In 2018, when my friends resigned from A.M.M.A, I stayed back thinking at least a few should continue to work within a broken system and help repair it. But after watching [the] A.M.M.A general secretary speak, I have abandoned all hope that anything will ever change within this association,” she said in the facebook post.

She demanded that Mr. Babu resign from the post and expressed hope that “other conscientious members will also demand for the same.”

“I will be keenly watching to see who will come forward. I urge every member to see that it is a hazy bubble of 'welfare' that is wrapped around a core of corrupt morals,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/i3kf9/article32838022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12KRAPARVARTHY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/actor-parvathy-resigns-from-amma/article32836148.ece
129,2020/10/12,Kerala Tourism plans micro-forests in 12 districts,"Around 30,000 saplings will be planted in 1.84 acres

Kerala Tourism will embrace the Miyawaki method of afforestation to create 22 micro-forests in tourist destinations in 12 districts.

By December 2020, around 30,000 saplings will be planted in 1.84 acres using the highly successful technique, pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, being used by the government and nature lovers to increase green cover in urban and semi-urban areas.

The micro-forests are expected to enhance the environment and nature-friendly surroundings of the destinations and turn an added attraction for visitors.

Two micro-forests each are being planned in 10 districts and one each in Thiruvananthapuram and Pathanamthitta, covering 10 cents. The saplings are expected to achieve an average height of 10 ft within 12 months.

Wayanad and Idukki have been left out in the initial phase as these two districts have the maximum forest coverage and rural ambience.

The land will be identified by the Department of Tourism. The nature of the forest — whether pure evergreen, medicinal, flower and fruit — will be decided after finalising the location.

Different species of plants varying from 30 to 100 depending on the locality and nature of the forest will be planted. Only indigenous wild species will be planted and medicinal plants will get priority.

A consortium led by Culture Shoppe has bagged the work through e-bidding. The Nature’s Green Guardians Foundation (NGGF), an NGO, and Invis Multimedia are the partners.

The working group on tourism has cleared the project and the consortium will take care of maintenance, official sources told The Hindu.

The foreseen benefits include reduction in carbon dioxide levels, groundwater recharge, biodiversity conservation, tourist attraction, employment generation, and awareness creation.

Last year, the NGGF developed a Miyawaki forest on five cents on the Kanakakunnu palace premises for Kerala Tourism with 426 saplings from 120 species. Around 100 micro-forests are coming up across the State in government and private land.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-tourism-plans-micro-forests-in-12-districts/article32836096.ece
130,2020/10/12,COVID patients allowed personal caregivers,"Hospitals will decide depending on patient’s illness and circumstances

In view of the acute shortage of support staff and nursing staff in hospitals to take care of COVID-19 patients, the Health Department has decided to allow family members/friends of in-patients to remain in the ward as caregivers.

The decision has come close on the heels of an incident in Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, where an elderly and chronically bedridden patient in the COVID-19 ward, when discharged after a month, was found to have maggot-infested bedsores.

Staff shortage

The government’s attempt to hold doctors and nursing staff responsible for the incident had been stiffly resisted by doctors and nurses who pointed to the lack of support staff in COVID-19 wards.

Patients in COVID-19 wards are not allowed to have personal caregivers as part of the hospital’s protocol to prevent people from outside carrying infection into the hospitals. It was in the absence of adequate staff or family members that such serious neglect had occurred in the care of the elderly patient, it was pointed out.

In this context, the Health Department has directed hospital superintendents to allow caregivers for patients in COVID-19 wards, on consultation with the institutional COVID board. Accordingly, hospital superintendents can decide on allowing caregivers to individual patients, depending on their illness and circumstances.

Conditions

Friends or family members can act as caregivers as long as they are healthy. Previously COVID-infected persons can also be caregivers if they have completed a month since being tested negative. The caregiver will have to wear PPE kit and follow all COVID-19 protocols strictly, the directive issued by the Health Department says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-patients-allowed-personal-caregivers/article32835987.ece
131,2020/10/12,Yellow alert for 11 districts in Kerala today,"IMD also issues thunderstorm warning for State till Oct. 15

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a thunderstorm warning for Kerala with central and northern districts expected to receive isolated heavy rainfall over the next few days.

Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning are likely at one or two places in the State till October 15, the IMD said.

Yellow alerts have been issued for several central and northern districts as they are likely to receive isolated heavy rainfall. Yellow alerts have been issued for all districts in the State except Pathanamthitta, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. Malappuram, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod have been put on yellow alert on Wednesday and Thursday.

Advisory to fishermen

Fishermen have been advised not to venture out to sea as squally weather is likely to prevail over the Kerala coast.

The depression over the west-central Bay of Bengal has intensified into a deep depression and lay about 250 km south-southeast of Visakhapatnam.

A fresh low-pressure area is likely to form over east-central and adjoining north-east Arabian Sea off the north Konkan, south Gujarat coasts around October 15. There is a low to moderate probability of its intensification into a depression over the same region, the IMD said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/umvouk/article32838789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20201012181759,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/yellow-alert-for-11-districts-in-kerala-today/article32835943.ece
132,2020/10/12,"Explain Swapna’s visits to Cliff House, Chennithala tells CM","UDF stage protests across State demanding CM’s resignation

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Monday said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should tell the public what business gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh had at his official residence at Cliff House.

Inaugurating a State-wide protest by the United Democratic Front (UDF) demanding Mr. Vijayan’s resignation on the charge of abetting economic offenders, Mr. Chennithala said Swapna had told the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that she had met Mr. Vijayan at Cliff House at least six times.

She had also stated that Mr. Vijayan had introduced Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar as his point man and go-to person.

Anticipating a criminal inquiry, the government had destroyed evidence of Mr. Vijayan’s culpability by fraudulently claiming that lightning had damaged the surveillance cameras at Cliff House and no footage was recoverable.

Mr. Vijayan had turned the flood tragedy into an opportunity for unscrupulous commission agents to make money. Central agencies had found that Swapna profited from the UAE’s generosity to low-income families displaced by the floodwaters. The government eyed fancy projects, such as the Wayanad tunnel, as an opportunity for more corruption.

Mr. Chennithala alleged that Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel’s acceptance of vast quantities of dates and the Koran as Ramzan charity from the UAE consulate was under a pall of suspicion against the backdrop of the gold smuggling case.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran said law and order had broken down under Mr. Vijayan. In the past three weeks, armed assailants felled nine persons in Thrissur district alone. The disputes in the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had manifested as violence in the street.

133,2020/10/12,Giving statement copy to Swapna will impede probe: Customs,"Agency tells HC that it will defeat attempts to reach to top-level persons

The Customs on Monday informed the Kerala High Court that if Swapna Suresh, one of the prime accused in the gold smuggling case, is given her statement recorded by the Customs, it would impede the investigation into the involvement of highly influential and affluent persons.

The Customs while opposing her plea for a directive to provide her recorded statement also added that her statement had made references to many highly placed influential persons. She had close proximity to high power centres. Besides, she commanded considerable influence over various political functionaries and foreign dignitaries.

The Customs submitted that they were closing in on some highly influential persons and the attempts to reach to top-level persons and officials in political and public life both in the country and abroad would be defeated if a copy of the statement was given to one of the prime accused. It was part of the investigation papers. Besides, the Criminal Procedure Code and the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act barred from providing statements made by an accused during the period of investigation.

Counsel for the accused submitted that the statements of the other accused had been made available and therefore she was entitled to get a copy of her own statement.

The KSRTC will launch a mobile health clinic with laboratory facilities in the capital district and the utility will tie up with government and private hospitals in 13 other districts for medical check-up of those on its rolls.

Once in 3 months

The government has sanctioned ₹29 lakh for the medical check-up of KSRTC staff, Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran said on Sunday. The KSRTC management is planning to create health awareness among staff and conduct medical check-up every three months.

To overcome the difficulties posed to the drivers by heat, there smaller openings will be made below the window by the driver’s seat to enhance air circulation. There will be a holder near the seat where water bottles can be kept.

7,000 personnel

The mobile health clinic will cater to the needs of the 7,000 personnel on the rolls in the 24 depots of the KSRTC in the capital and the Central Works in Pappanamcode.

The health clinic, which will be set up by modifying a bus, will reach all the 25 units in Thiruvananthapuram and subject the personnel to medical check-up. The clinic will have a doctor, nurse, and a lab technician.

Fatigue impact

Instructions have been given by the KSRTC management to the unit officers in other districts to tie up with nearby government or private hospitals for carrying out the personnel’s medical check-up.

Fatigued drivers react slower and experience reduced attention, awareness, and ability to control their vehicles, thereby contributing to fatal road accidents, according to road safety experts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ksrtc-staff-to-undergo-medical-check-up/article32835795.ece
135,2020/10/12,VACB may take over Space Park posting case,"KSITIL officials likely to come under scrutiny

The Kerala Police on Monday appeared inclined to recommend a Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (VACB) inquiry into the “back-door” appointment of gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh in the IT Department’s Space Park project.

The police had in August indicted Swapna for “fraudulently” gaining employment in Space Park by “faking” her academic qualification. The investigation had made little headway.

Nevertheless, a prefatory inquiry had reportedly revealed cognisable offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The purported malfeasances included suspicion of nepotism in Swapna’s appointment, an undue pecuniary advantage to the suspect, and corresponding loss to the exchequer.

Space Park had fixed Swapna’s salary at an estimated ₹1 lakh per month, and she had reportedly drawn roughly ₹20 lakh from the treasury via a private consultancy during her short tenure there.

The police are likely to move the government to transfer the case to the VACB. If so, top officials of Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited (KSITIL), the public sector entity that runs the Space Park project, will come under legal scrutiny for Swapna’s questionable posting.

The VACB will probe whether the KSITIL or the private placement consultancy it had contracted for such appointments had notified the job vacancy or fixed the requisite qualification as per government norm.

An anti-corruption probe might examine whether M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, had any role in Swapna’s posting.

A panel headed by Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta had indicated that Swapna’s employment in Space Park smacked of favouritism.

Mr. Mehta said in his report that Mr. Sivasankar had “referred to appoint a person (Swapna) who was working as secretary to the Consul General, UAE, to the post of operations manager/junior consultant for Space Park” project. He said Mr. Sivasankar’s “frequent contacts with a foreign consulate official” violated IAS conduct rules and the episode had “wider ramifications”.

The Opposition had repeatedly raised the issue of Swapna’s controversial posting as an insult to unemployed youth in the State and an example of how the government had outsourced recruitment to private agencies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vacb-may-take-over-space-park-posting-case/article32835789.ece
136,2020/10/12,NIA hints at terror link of accused in gold smuggling case,"Agency says accused telephoned members of ISIS, SIMI

Hinting at the terror connection of an accused in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said Muhammad Ali, the 12th accused, had made telephone calls to members of proscribed terror organisations, ISIS and SIMI.

The counsel for the agency made the revelation at the NIA special court on Monday when the bail applications of some of the accused were considered.

Money transactions

According to the agency, the call data analysis of the accused pointed at large money transactions. Huge volumes of data were recovered from his gadgets. The agency had obtained mirror images of 17 electronic gadgets seized from various accused in the case. The pandemic had delayed the analysis of the digital devices. The accused needed to be confronted with the evidence obtained from the digital devices and the confessional statement from one of the accused, the agency said.

The counsel for the NIA also submitted that the agency had laid its hands on some of the documents forged by Sandeep Nair, the first accused in the case.

Plea for bail

The lawyers for the accused argued that those with minimal role in the offence should be released on bail and not kept in jail along with the other accused. If the agency wanted to interrogate them, their presence would be ensured, they contended.

The lawyers submitted that there was no justification for denying bail to those not facing serious charges. The court can ensure the presence of the accused by cancelling the bail, they argued. They also contended that the NIA was adopting ‘delay tactics’ in the court to deny bail to the accused.

Till tomorrow

However, the NIA counsel said the remand of a few accused was necessary till Wednesday for interrogation. The court accepted the contention and extended the remand till Wednesday. The court is likely to pronounce its decision on the bail application of a batch of accused on Thursday.

The court has also posted the bail application of P.S. Sarith and Swapna Suresh, the first and second accused in the case, for October 15.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nia-hints-at-terror-link-of-accused/article32835752.ece
137,2020/10/12,Kerala's public education goes digital,"Kerala presenting a good model in rejuvenating public education: CM

The Public Education Rejuvenation Mission is an excellent participatory development model that Kerala is presenting before the world, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Monday.

Mr. Vijayan was speaking after declaring the State’s public education sector as the first to go completely digital and announcing the completion of high-tech classroom and hi-tech lab projects in government and aided schools.

Kerala succeeded in ushering in major reforms in public education when governments all over the world were gradually withdrawing from public facilities. The step taken by the State would benefit future generations, Mr. Vijayan said.

He said that the credit for the achievement belonged to the entire State and not just the LDF government. ''The Public Education Rejuvenation Mission has drawn cooperation from all sides. We were able to transform the notion that the public education sector was in shambles. Today there is no such concern. That schools in the State have registered an increase by five lakh students over the past few years reveal how students and parents have received this initiative,'' he added.

Infrastructure facilities as well academic standards of the schools had improved in the efforts taken to raise schools in Kerala to international standards, he said. He also urged teachers to take the initiative to sustain the pace of progress achieved in the sector.

High-tech classrooms and hi-tech labs in schools were established by the Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) with financial assistance from Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KIIFB). In all, 3,74,274 digital equipment were distributed to schools under the two projects carried out as part of the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission.

In the first phase, 45,000 high-tech classrooms for Classes 8 to 12 were readied in 4,752 government and aided high schools and higher secondary schools. High-tech labs were started in 11,275 primary and upper primary schools for Classes 1 to 7.

By opting for free software solutions, KITE was able to save ₹3,000 crore, the Chief Minister said.

140,2020/10/12,Sargam showcases students skills in various disciplines,"Programme of Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, gets good response

Sargam, a programme launched by the district unit of the Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, to get specialist teachers to promote students’ skills in arts, sports, and work experience has received a good response.

Besides keeping students engaged and in a positive frame of mind and alleviating their anxieties during these unsettling times, Sargam also aims to provide those interested in these areas opportunities to nurture their talents.

In the first phase, all students in the district from lower primary to higher secondary and vocational streams are taking part in the programme. Videos of various activities prepared by Samagra at the district level are shared by trainers on a WhatsApp group and from there percolate down to school headmaster, school resource group comprising teachers, and finally on class WhatsApp groups.

Videos

The videos are categorised into Kaliveedu (work experience education), Kalikkalam (health and sports education), Chitraveedu (painting), and Pattupetti (music).

Both Kaliveedu and Kalikkalam are further segmented as per the class in which students study, while Chitraveedu and Pattupetti are for students from classes 5 to 8.

After watching the videos, students’ doubts or recommendations can be shared on the school group and cluster groups. Their works are shared on the school groups and shared at the block resource level too to motivate them.

While opportunities to watch the videos on class groups are available, there has been demand for uploading them on YouTube to enable repeat viewing.

In the next phase of Sargam, teachers will be asked to identify talented students on the basis of responses to the videos and formed into groups on a cluster basis. Specialist teachers will take classes for these students online to hone their talents.

When schools reopen, these students will be given direct classes by the specialist teachers, say Samagra officials.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sargam-showcases-students-skills-in-various-disciplines/article32829455.ece
141,2020/10/12,10-day Alpasi festival deferred,"Chief priest of Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple tests positive for SARS-CoV-2

The 10-day annual Alpasi festival of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, scheduled to commence from October 15, has been deferred as 10 persons, including the chief priest and joint chief priest of the iconic temple in the capital, have been infected by SARS-CoV- 2.Devotees are not being allowed from October 9 after the chief priest, joint chief priest and support staff of the temple tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday evening. Only the chief priest and the Tantri have the right to perform poojas in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.

Difficult

Since Friday, Tantri Tharanallur Satheesan Namboodiripad is performing the poojas in the temple. The decision to defer the festival was taken as the Tantri opined that it will be difficult to go ahead with the festival in the absence of chief priest, joint chief priest and other priests.

The festivals of Thiruvallam Parasurama temple, Vaduvathu Mahavishnu temple, Cheriya Udeswaram temple and Arakathu Devi temple in the capital held along with the Alpasi festival will have to be postponed as the idols of the four temples are taken jointly for the arat.

The temple authorities will decide on the new dates for the Alpasi festival in consultation with the Tantri. The authorities are hopeful of opening the temple for devotees from October 16, one day before the idols of Goddess Saraswati from Padmanabhapuram Thevarakkett, the idol of Kumaraswamy from Velimalai Murugan temple and the idol of Munnuttinanga from Sthanumalayan temple in Suchindram reaches the Navarathri mandapam in front of the temple for the 10-day Navaratri celebrations.

143,2020/10/12,Groundwaterfaces arsenic threat: study,"‘20 States and four Union territories are affected by this problem’

Researchers have underscored the need for policy interventions at the highest level to urgently address the serious threat posed by arsenic contamination of groundwater in the country.

According to a paper published in Geoscience Frontiers, 20 States and four Union territories are affected by this problem now.

The paper ‘Arsenic contamination of groundwater: A global synopsis with focus on the Indian Peninsula’ is authored by E. Shaji, Associate Professor, Department of Geology, University of Kerala; M. Santosh, Foreign Expert at the China University of Geosciences, Beijing; and K.V. Sarath, Pranav Prakash, V. Deepchand and B. V. Divya of the Department of Geology, University of Kerala.

Arsenic contamination in groundwater was first reported from Chandigarh, and a second case was reported in the lower Gangetic plain of West Bengal.

20 States hit

“'But now we find that 20 States are affected,” Dr. Shaji said.

The list mentions south Indian States Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and the Union Territory of Puducherry. Investigations in Kerala are in progress, he said. Drinking arsenic contaminated groundwater can lead to serious health issues including cancers, coronary heart disease, liver damage, arsenicosis and hyperkeratosis. according to the authors.

“'Thirty-three Asian countries are significantly affected by groundwater arsenic contamination. The most affected countries are China, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. In India, it is reported that a population over 50 million is currently at risk from arsenic contamination,”' it noted.

Groundwater can get contaminated by both natural processes and anthropogenic causes like mining.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/groundwaterfaces-arsenic-threat-study/article32829411.ece

145,2020/10/12,Polls spoiler for capital city draft master plan,"Council yet to take up amendments to IDO

The Thiruvananthapuram draft master plan 2031 is unlikely to see the light of the day before the local body elections.

The proposed amendments in the Interim Development Order (IDO), which governs the awarding of building permits and all kinds of land use in the city, in the absence of a sanctioned master plan, have also been hanging fire as these are yet to be taken up for discussion and approval in the meetings of the Corporation council.

The two recent meetings of the Corporation council, convened over video conference, had ended with hardly any transaction of its usual business.

Technical glitches had made the Corporation to cut short the meetings. The amendments to the IDO, which are beneficial to those who were having difficulties in getting their building permit applications cleared as their land was wrongly marked as paddy field or meant for public use, were included in the agenda for the previous council meeting.

The Town Planning Department is almost done with the preparation of the draft master plan.

Strong protests

But the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) is also wary of taking it up before the local body elections, considering the strong protests by the people in some wards which were recently added to the Corporation when the previous plan was released some years back.

The plan was then scrapped. Though the latest draft master plan is being prepared by addressing most of the issues from the previous one, there are still concerns of public perception at a time when the local body elections are drawing near.

The Corporation’s Town Planning Standing Committee is planning to get at least the amendments to the IDO passed in the upcoming council meetings. The amendments are meant to benefit those who have been unable to get building permits as their land is supposed to be paddy land or in some specific zone, even though they are not. Such files are now forwarded to the Regional Town Planner's office for concurrence. With these amendments, the Corporation can take the decision at its level itself and avoid the delays faced by the public.

The Mayor has called an all party meeting on Monday to discuss various issues including the holding of council meetings.

The opposition parties had in the previous council meeting raised concerns regarding online meetings and had demanded that meetings should be held in the council hall.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/polls-spoiler-for-capital-city-draft-master-plan/article32829379.ece
146,2020/10/12,What’s in a name?,"Looking at the pros and cons of the proposed division and change of name of Anna University

A rose by any other name may smell as sweet; but to pick out a rose you cannot be smelling thousands of flowers. Names do matter in quick identification.

‘Perarignar Anna University of Technology (PAUT)’ came into being in 1978 and was renamed ‘Anna University (AU)’ the next year, without much loss of time or change in reputation. Until 2001, AU was a unitary university, with only CEG, ACT, MIT and SAP as its constituent colleges. Subsequently, AU was recast as an affiliating university with about 500 colleges under its fold. Naturally, without adequate manpower, resources and experience, AU had to divert its talent pool from mostly teaching and research into administration. Tens of directors, chairmen and coordinators were created to handle the affiliated institutions. Again, citing administrative reasons, AU was split into five universities located at Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Tiruchi and Tirunelveli. A little later, the five universities were merged into one under the name AU.

Despite all these changes, AU steered itself fairly quickly into clear waters and earned a name in the annals of technical education. Until recently, AU was known for its entrance exams and admission procedure in Tamil Nadu.

But now the picture is different. The Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Exams (TNPCEE), originally designed by Dr. V.C. Kulandaisamy, has been abolished and the operation of Single Window Engineering Admission System designed by Dr. M. Anandakrishnan has been entrusted to the Directorate of Technical Education (DoTE). AU has thus lost a little of its lustre.

Division

Now comes the news of splitting AU into two: the original unitary AU, with the name ATRU (Anna Technological and Research University), and the university comprising the rest of the engineering colleges, with the name AU.

The split is welcome. A major reason is that the ‘unitary AU’ would then be better qualified for the award of ‘Institution of Excellence’. It will be able to contribute better in research, with reduced administrative burden. But changing its name to anything else is totally unjustified. During its 40 years of existence, it has earned a worldwide reputation as a technical university of high acclaim, which will be lost. The alumni will be aggrieved since their alma mater loses recognition. If names (and symbols) are not important, why then do political parties fight over party names, party flags and election symbols?

Giving the same name to another university is even worse, since it will create wrong inferences. It is simply robbing one university of its hard-earned reputation and ascribing it to another. In research output, for example, all the affiliated colleges have so far produced only about 23% of what the ‘existing’ AU has produced. These credits might be swapped due to the name changes proposed. This is akin to plagiarism, violation of intellectual property rights, copyrights, trademark and patent piracy. This will be an injustice done to our institution by our government. Rectification is required.

147,2020/10/12,"The Boys’ women cast talk about their characters’ actions, and the real-world parallels to the show","Aya Cash, Erin Moriarty, Karen Fukuhara, Shantel VanSanten and Colby Minifie were present at a recent virtual press day titled Girls Get it Done

Taking inspiration from The Boys’ universe — Amazon Prime Video’s anti-superhero show — a virtual press day that brought together the women from the show, titled Girls Get it Done, was held recently. Aya Cash (who plays the Nazi Stormfront), Erin Moriarty (Starlight), Karen Fukuhara (Kimiko), Shantel VanSanten (Becca Butcher) and Colby Minifie (Ashley) were present.

One thing that the actors felt strongly about? The show’s villains. Talking about Homelander, the sociopathic leader of The Seven (played by Antony Starr), Erin says, “I just think about him and it makes me so angry.” Shantel agrees, “I would probably want Becca to have whatever power it is that could incinerate Homelander in one second.”

Aya, meanwhile, has this to say about Stormfront. “I just want to say she is despicable and disgusting.”

Edited excerpts:

Both seasons have highlighted several real-world issues. In Season 2, with Stormfront, there are parallels with the increased visibility of white supremacist groups in America. Was that a factor in your decision to take the role and did you have any apprehensions because of that?

Aya Cash: Yes, to both. I was aware of the complications of the role, and what it was going to be shining a light on. I was apprehensive because there were no scripts, and so there was nothing for me to say, ‘This is the way it is being done and handled and I agree with that’. I met with Eric Kripke when I was auditioning, to talk about what the role was and what he was going to be doing with it, and I was able to watch three episodes of the show to get the tone of it. I had a lot of trust in Eric because of the way that he talked about it and the real-life people that he was pointing to when crafting Stormfront. I felt like it was an interesting, important story. That is all you can do when you accept a job; take that leap of faith because it is hard to make something good. I was excited by the possibility and hopefully, we have pulled it off.

As Starlight mentions, there are similarities between Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and Homelander. However, one big difference is that not only has Butcher experienced love, he has also given love. In that context, can you elaborate on the relationship between Becca and Butcher?

Shantel VanSanten: Sure. That is a story that I am so grateful to be a part of and to tell. Karl is an incredible actor. From day one, he made it feel like such a safe environment to create and figure out who Becca and Billy used to be together. I wish we got a few more glimpses of that because the Becca that we meet in Season 2 who has lived in a bubble for 10 years isn’t authentically who she is. It is basically a character of herself that she plays for a much bigger reason. There is a darkness to Becca that we don't get to explore as much. There are reasons that they connected and it was really important in episode four [of Season 2] for us to try to dive into a bit of their history and to allow you to see that they truly are soulmates. They can’t be together and make it work because of circumstances. That part of it was really hard for me: that Becca sacrificed everything and ultimately, she doesn't get everything to be happy. She has to keep making choices that are better for everyone else.

A major theme in the show is nature versus nurture. In this universe, how important is the parent, particularly the mother’s role, in raising a child?

Shantel: As it was described to me, it is the reason that Homelander turned out the way he did. He didn’t have the mothering and the nurturing. He had people who are corrupt raising him for their own purposes rather than out of unconditional love. I think that Becca understands that and that is why she has made the sacrifices she has. There is redemption for her in being able to raise a child out of a rape, who could be hope for the world. Her task in life and in this season is to give the child nurturing, love, empathy and understanding of human emotions.

Season 2 ends with Starlight and Queen Maeve with the upper hand against Homelander. How is this going to change the dynamic between the two?

Erin Moriarty: I think there's an inevitable partnership to be formed and solidified. There has been a resistance from Queen Maeve and it is partially because she’s going through her own battle and is in her own world and rightfully so. I am going through my own battle and so the partnership is not as present this season. However, there is always an underlying presence that Queen Maeve has in Starlight’s life as a support system. I think that she proves time and time again that when Starlight needs her, she'll step up even if it means defying someone like Homelander. I think it is because Queen Maeve and Starlight are the only females in The Seven until Stormfront joins. Obviously, Stormfront’s position in The Seven becomes compromised in Season 2.

We see it a lot at the end of Season 1 too. How Queen Maeve says to Starlight, ‘Don't be like me, don’t become like me because I see you going down that road. Let me be the cautionary tale’. I can see the partnership solidifying as time goes on and I could see their necessity to band together as women who are working for this corporation that is out to objectify them.

Ashley and her team are the ones who shape public perception of the superheroes. This has real world parallels as well. What are your thoughts on how celebrities are presented to the public and what the public should keep in mind when following said celebrities?

Colby Minifie: I think that is something the show does well. It shows how corporations and people that have money to spend on changing the narrative can get away with murder. That is a part of The Boys storyline that I am happy to be a part of because it helps me become more aware of how a corporation can say, ‘We believe in this’, and [then] they don’t enact a lot of what they say. Then it becomes a capitalistic opportunity and it can also be a lie.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/g835rf/article32835640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08bgmTheBoys1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-boys-women-cast-talk-about-their-characters-actions-and-the-real-world-parallels-to-the-show/article32835642.ece

Akshay Kumar’s action-drama “Sooryavanshi” is eyeing a theatrical release window between January and March 2021, after being pushed from its planned Diwali opening, Reliance Entertainment Group CEO Shibasish Sarkar said on Monday.

The studio had announced in June that the Rohit Shetty directorial will hit the theatres on Diwali, while their another release the sports drama “83”, fronted by Ranveer Singh, will arrive on Christmas.

“We will release ‘Sooryavanshi’ on a future date, which we haven’t yet decided. Akshay, Rohit and Reliance will decide together on the new release date ideally between January to March,” Sarkar said.

Sarkar said releasing “Sooryavanshi” on such a short notice, after the Centre approved reopening of cinema halls from October 15, was not possible. Hence, the team decided to defer the film, he added.

“Earlier we had made announcements for the release of ‘Sooryavanshi’ on Diwali and ‘83’ on Christmas. Now releasing a film in Diwali is not practical as some states still haven’t announced opening up theatres and you can’t release ‘Sooryavanshi’ with less than one month promotion.

“For ‘83’, as of now it’s slated for a Christmas release. (There is) No change in that process,” he said.

“Sooryavanshi” was originally scheduled to release on March 24 and the Kabir Khan-directed “83” was set to hit the cinema houses on April 10.

But both the movies were indefinitely postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, which led to the shutdown of theatres across the country and in other parts of the world.

“Sooryavanshi” is the fourth film in Shetty’s cop universe after Ajay Devgn’s “Singham”, “Singham Returns”, and “Simmba”, starring Singh.

The film is presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films.

“83, which chronicles India’s first cricket World Cup win under the captaincy of Kapil Dev in 1983, also stars Hardy Sandhu, Tahir Raj Bhasin, Jiva, Saqib Saleem, Pankaj Tripathi and Deepika Padukone.

It is produced by Khan, Vishnu Vardhan Induri, Madhu Mantena, Padukone and Sajid Nadiadwala and presented by Reliance Entertainment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/22pnzj/article32835462.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/akshay-kumar-Sooryavanshi-1200,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sooryavanshi-looks-for-january-march-2021-release-83-set-for-christmas/article32835463.ece
149,2020/10/12,Director Zakariya Mohammed speaks about his upcoming Malayalam film ‘Halal Love Story’,"Zakariya Mohammed and Muhsin Parari team up again for ‘Halal Love Story’, premièring on October 15 on Amazon Prime

Expectations are high as filmmaker-writer Zakariya Mohammed’s second film Halal Love Story premières on Amazon Prime on October 15. His first film, Sudani from Nigeria, a box-office winner, had swept the Kerala State film awards and won two national awards.

MetroPlus speaks with Zakariya about the film and its cast comprising some of the brightest stars of Malayalam cinema such as Indrajith, Parvathy Thiruvothu, Soubin Shahir, Joju George, Sharaf U Dheen, Grace Antony and so on.

The trailer, released a few days ago, has upped the anticipation for the film that has been shot at Malappuram in Kerala. It narrates the story of a group of film lovers and the hurdles they have to cross and the compromises they have to make to realise their dream of shooting a film.

Edited excerpts from an interview over phone…

Are the expectations about the film a burden on you?

Not really. It is the same excitement and anxiety that we experienced before the release of my first film. As far as my team is concerned, it is a new film that we are giving to viewers. So we are keen to see if (and how) the audience accepts this film and how they will react to it. As filmmakers, their acceptance of a film is important for us.

Is this anticipation for a director’s film product a source of strength for the filmmaker?

This expectation is part of an entertainment culture. When a team that came good with their first film comes together for another film, naturally, viewers might expect the team to do well again. But, looking at it from the perspective of the filmmaker and his team, each film should be able to give a new experience for the viewer. So, none of us is burdened by the success of Sudani from Nigeria; now, our thoughts are all about how the audience will feel about Halal Love Story.

‘Conflict between alienation and assimilation’ Writer, scenarist and director Muhsin Parari has worked on some of the most-about-talked Malayalam films in recent times, such as KL 10, Varathan, Sudani from Nigeria and Virus.

Talking about the title of Halal Love Story, of which he is one of the writers, Muhsin says that the idea for the film came after Zakariya had participated in the commemoration meeting of a well-known poet in Malabar. One of the speakers mentioned how the poet had wanted to make a film that adhered to his beliefs. As soon as Zakariya shared this with Muhsin, on the spur of the moment, Muhsin said that it would be a kind of ‘Halal Love Story’.

“It was the title that came first, much before we wrote the script. In the post-globalised world, it is about a group of people caught between alienation and assimilation. We are zooming in to their lives and conflicts, pain and determination but it is all told with a great deal of humour. Halal Love story is an account of a collective of people trying to live in the present without transgressing their beliefs and customs,” says Muhsin, over phone from Malappuram.

“Halal popularly refers to the things permissible to a person following Islam. But there is a taboo around ‘love story’. So the title hints at the conflict in the characters,” he adds.

Unlike Sudani…, which had a novel theme, Halal Love Story involves a film within a film, which we have seen in many movies….

This is a fresh perspective, a fresh take. Yes, there is the story of a film within the film. But the context in which the story is told, the narrative and the content are different and new.

The cast is a filmmaker’s dream come true….

These are actors I have always wanted to work with. Be it Indrajith, Joju, Grace Antony, Parvathy, Sharaf U Dheen and Soubin (with whom I had worked with in Sudani...), they are all storehouses of talent. Most directors aspire to work with good actors because we want to tap their talent, their ability to come up with superb work. It was wonderful to see the competitive spirit and dedication with which the actors of Halal Love Story breathed life into their characters and the story.

You and Muhsin Parari had written the script of Sudani… and now both of you are working together in Halal Love Story as well. Is there a comfort zone when working with friends and people you have worked with earlier?

This script happened organically. After Sudani…, I was busy with another script while Muhsin worked on Virus. That is when we came up with the idea of Halal Love Story and decided to try writing it down to see how it developed.

Ashif Kakkodi has also been credited as co-writer…

He is our co-writer. Kakkodi was part of the discussions about the film as he and I were working on another script. That is when Halal Love Story got shaped. Ashif’s association was there during the writing of the screenplay.

What is your opinion about the release of Halal... on an OTT platform?

There is a lot of confusion. Several films, including ours, have been completed and are awaiting release. But, as of now, none of us has any idea when theatres will be reopened. All of us, including government officials, are hoping that things will get sorted out. But, as far as we are concerned, as a creative team, we would like to do more films. At present, OTT platforms are a medium for us to reach viewers. For instance, Halal Love Story première in 200 countries. So, though a total theatre experience will be missing, we will be reaching out to many more viewers. We are trying to do the best in the current scenario.

Any clues about your new project?

We are in talks for a project with Mammookka (Mammootty). It has not been titled yet. It is likely to start only after there is more clarity about the situation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9avkb2/article32835112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tvmHalal1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-zakariya-mohammed-speaks-about-his-upcoming-malayalam-film-halal-love-story/article32835114.ece
150,2020/10/12,Chandini revisits the 1990s for ‘Colour Photo’,"Chandini Chowdary on why she went against the norm to take up the Telugu film ‘Colour Photo’

A few years ago, Chandini Chowdary was the lone female student of Mechanical Engineering in a Bengaluru college. She enjoyed the welding, soldering and other strenuous practical sessions the course involved. She also began working on a project to harness wind energy in the rural sector, using minimal equipment. “My friend and I still have all the project details. Maybe someday we will execute it. I strongly believe in sustainable energy and lowering carbon footprint,” she says. That project might have led to a start-up, if she hadn’t entered Telugu cinema.

Lockdown dairies Chandini says it was liberating to toss her phone aside and recoup from work. She caught up on reading and painting. She missed travelling though: “I had grand plans to visit Japan in April with my mom. But I have no complaints. The lockdown has been harsh on many people.”

On her reading list: Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol is one of her favourites. She also appreciates Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead. She’s currently reading A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle and says, “His books, including The Power of Now, help me understand why people behave the way they do. Most often it has to do with them, than with you. That helped me be at peace during certain interactions.”

A self-confessed Potterhead, she has fond memories of exploring the Harry Potter world at the Universal Studios, USA: “I did everything from drinking butter beer to collecting souvenirs.”

The actor, who has to her credit films such as Manu, Howrah Bridge and web series Gods of Dharmapuri and Masti’s, will be next seen in the film Colour Photo, which will stream on Aha from October 23.

Chandini had wanted “to be a heroine” even when she was in school. “I grew up in a middle class family in Vizag and I don’t know what attracted me to cinema,” she reminisces with a laugh. Her parents insisted she complete her education and she even finished engineering with distinction.

The shorts

When she first had an opportunity to act in a short film (The Week; 2011), she did it quietly without informing anyone: “I didn’t own a smartphone back then. I saw the film on my personal computer and felt happy. I thought no one would notice, but word got around.” After the short film The Blind Date (directed by Subhash Chandra, co-starring Raj Tarun) went viral, she started getting noticed in public spaces. “I had no idea content uploaded on YouTube could become so popular,” she says.

Chandini got to be more than a glamorous heroine in some of her films. Phanindra Narisetti’s Manu had an arthouse appeal and didn’t earn a wide audience, but the industry took note of her as an actor of substance.

It wasn’t a coincidence that she teamed up with director Sandeep Raj and actor Suhas, who began their journey with short films, for Colour Photo.

Throwback to the 1990s

When Sandeep wanted a female lead who could portray an upper class, beautiful, intelligent and independent-minded young woman, he approached Chandini: “I was blown away by the story and how my character was written. The film begins in the 1990s and addresses class and caste issues; I portray a sensible, sensitive and intelligent woman. There’s something pure about the story and the semi-urban setting. I discussed with my mom and my aunt to know how they might have reacted in such fictitious situations,” says Chandini.

Naysayers felt it wasn’t a wise career move to act alongside comedian-turned-hero Suhas. “Whenever I’ve done films to impress others, I’ve failed. From the time I did Manu, my views changed. I realised the importance of making choices that I am happy to begin with.”

She hopes Colour Photo will open new doors for her in Telugu cinema. Next, she has a film produced by Sudheer Varma.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jltj47/article32833904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chandini-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chandini-chowdary-talks-about-colour-photo-and-telugu-cinema/article32833906.ece

The duo had scored music for 400-odd films in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Tulu, Hindi and Sinhala.

Condoling Rajan’s death, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said, “I am deeply pained to learn about the demise of Sri Rajan. May his soul rest in eternal peace. May God give strength to the bereaved family members, relatives and fans to bear the loss.”

Yediyurappa said Rajan will always be remembered for giving hundreds of melodious songs.

Several ministers and public representatives condoled the demise of Rajan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ussvqr/article32833428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/noted-music-director-rajan-of-rajan-nagendra-fame-dead/article32833429.ece

Speaking on Star Sports’ pre-show Cricket Live about how he felt about Vijay Sethupathi playing his role in the film, Muralitharan said, ""Once the script was ready, we thought the best fit for this movie is none other than Vijay Sethupathi. I think he is a very talented actor and he will nail the bowling expressions. I trust Vijay completely as he is one of the greatest actors and I have complete faith that he’ll definitely do wonders for the film.”

Vijay Sethupathi on his part said that it was really nice to listen to Muralitharan’s story and spend time with him. “He is like a stamp, he makes a mark wherever he goes with his charming character and personality. I love his real life persona, because fans have seen him in matches on the field, but very few have got a chance to know Murali sir’s personality off the field. He’s such a beautiful person and his story needs to be told,” he remarked.

800, a fast-paced and funny biopic will be a moving portrayal of one of cricket’s most brilliant and divisive characters, and a tale of unorthodoxy, ethnicity, and pride. The film will be shot in Sri Lanka, U.K, Australia, and India. The shoot will start at the beginning of 2021 and the movie is set to release at the end of 2021.

The film will be made primarily in Tamil, and will also be dubbed in all South Indian languages, as well as Hindi, Bengali, and Sinhalese. An international version with English subtitles is also being planned.

They said the wards of serving defence personnel were included in the priority category and listed as priority VIII of the nine priority categories on the list. Last year, the State had allotted seats only for the wards of ex-servicemen. This was against the very spirit of the order of the Defence Ministry, they said.

158,2020/10/12,Online fraudsters impersonate Nilgiris collector,"Online scammers impersonating the Nilgiris district collector attempted to scam high-ranking officials from the district administration into purchasing online gift cards.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference, District Collector J.Innocent Divya said that a fake email account, claiming to be hers, had tried to target officials into purchasing gift cards from online retail stores. “The scammer would tell people who opened the email and wrote back outlining the amount of gift cards that the person should purchase,” said the collector.

After officials informed the collector of the attempted scam, a complaint was submitted to the Nilgiris district SP, V. Sasi Mohan. “We are attempting to trace the IP address of the person who has sent out the emails, and once arrested, the person would be booked under the relevant section of the Information Technology Act,” said the SP.

“The official email address of the Nilgiris collector is collrnlg@nic.in. If anybody gets any emails from any other email addresses claiming to be from the collector, please do not open it,” said the collector, who said that it was important that people were aware of cybercrime fraud and take appropriate steps to ensure that they do not become unwitting victims of such frauds.

“If people are even impersonating me, we can imagine how much of a menace this has become,” said Ms. Divya.

159,2020/10/12,Stalin calls for sacking of Anna University Vice Chancellor for directly writing to Centre on funds,"The DMK president alleged that the V-C’s letter was an attempt to ruin the State’s 69% reservation system and to saffronise the University’s higher education system

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday demanded the immediate sacking of Anna University Vice Chancellor M.K. Surappa for reportedly writing directly to the Centre that the university had the capability to raise ₹1,500 crore on its own without any assistance from the government for being declared as an Institution of Eminence.

Condemning the Vice-Chancellor’s alleged unilateral decision to write to the Centre, Mr. Stalin wondered if the University’s V-C was acting as another Chief Minister of the State and wanted to know if such a letter had been sent by him to the Centre with Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s permission.

“It is shocking to those who are interested in the development of higher education in Tamil Nadu and in particular the growth of Anna University that the V-C has written directly to the Centre. How did he have the audacity to write such a letter that will affect the students and more importantly, the legacy of Anna University, especially when his term is going to end soon,” the DMK president asked. He asked when a Committee has been formed to decide on the issue and its recommendations have not yet been made public, how did Mr. Surappa write to the Centre.

The DMK leader alleged that the V-C’s letter was also an attempt to ruin the State’s 69% reservation system and to saffronise the University’s higher education system. “I don’t consider his letter as an individual’s letter. The CM-VC- Governor are working in cahoots, and are conspiring to saffronise Anna University’s higher education,” Mr. Stalin charged.

On the purported point of Anna University’s ability to raise ₹1,500 crore by itself, Mr. Stalin wanted to know how the University would go about it. “It will put an immense burden on the parents of the students,” he said

162,2020/10/12,Man slits throat of 16-year-old girl in Kallakurichi,"The 28-year-old man died by suicide on Monday, while the girl is reported to be out of danger

A 16-year-old girl’s throat was allegedly slit by a 28-year-old cab driver in Thottiyam near here, on Sunday night. The man ended his own life later. The girl has been admitted to the Kallakurichi Government General Hospital, and is said to be out of danger.

The girl got acquainted with the young man, identified as Sathish of Namakkal district, working in Chennai. On Sunday, Sathish called the girl on her phone and took her to a secluded place in Kallakurichi. An argument broke out between them and Sathish reportedly slit the girl’s throat with a knife and fled the scene.

Bleeding profusely, the girl managed to reach the main road before falling unconscious. An Inspector of Police who was on patrol duty took the girl in his vehicle to the Kallakurichi GH.

164,2020/10/12,Work on restoration of Veedur dam begins,"Once the work is completed, the reservoir would have 105 mcft of additional capacity, officials said

Preliminary work for the restoration of Veedur dam near Vikravandi in Villupuram district has begun, with the Water Resources Organisation of the Public Works Department (PWD) carrying out aerial survey with the help of drones to map the dam’s profile and its water capacity.

“The previous survey conducted by the Institute of Hydraulics and Hydrology, Poondi in September had identified silt accumulation up to 105 million cubic feet (mcft),” a senior PWD official said. The second survey with drones would map the gradient, dam profile, contour level, accumulation of silt and the storage capacity of the dam.

“The administration has constituted a survey team for all the five villages located near the dam. The drones are expected to complete the aerial survey mapping of the parameters within a week’s time,” the official said.

The government has sanctioned a sum of ₹43 crore for restoration of the dam.

The Veedur dam, commissioned in 1959, is now a major source of irrigation for villages in Villupuram district and the neighbouring Union Territory of Puducherry.

The canal system of the reservoir comprises 17.6 km, of which 16.3 km passes through Tamil Nadu and 1.3 km through Puducherry. The dam is located at the confluence point of the Varaha and Thondi Rivers and irrigates about 2,200 acres in Villupuram district and 1,000 acres in Puducherry.

According to an official, the dam’s storage capacity is 605 mcft. The desilting exercise would enhance the dam’s storage capacity and about 105 mcft of silt would be removed.

The project also includes improvement work. The removed silt would be deposited in the foreshore bunds to a distance of 6 km to prevent encroachments and flooding on the other side, the official added.

The PWD will also be carrying out long-pending improvement work such as repair of shutters, strengthening of bunds and repairing branch channels.

The desilting work may take about one-and-a-half years. Once the work is completed, the reservoir would have 105 mcft of additional capacity.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/x0zi4p/article32832281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12OCTTH--Damjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/work-on-restoration-of-veedur-dam-begins/article32832282.ece

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi general secretary D. Ravikumar on Sunday said reservations for the Scheduled Castes should be increased to 21% in Tamil Nadu.

Outdated system

Speaking at a panel discussion on the completion of 100 years since the former depressed classes were called Adi Dravidars, Mr. Ravikumar said the 18% reservations for Scheduled Castes were fixed based on the 1971 census.

“Political reservation (reserved seats in MLA, MP categories and local bodies) was increased by 1% after delimitation, based on 2001 census. But, in employment and education, the reservations have not been increased. But after the 10% reservation was given for EWS, the upper limit does not hold true,” said Mr. Ravikumar. He urged political parties to support the demand in the interest of social justice as the community has been denied appropriate reservation for almost 50 years.

A day after a panchayat secretary and a ward member attached to the Therku Thittai panchayat in Mel Bhuvanagiri block were arrested after it came to light that Rajeshwari Saravana Kumar, the panchayat president, was forced to sit on the floor during meetings, the district administration has directed all block development officers (BDOs) to identify panchayats having caste issues or other forms of dispute.

Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri said that BDOs of all 14 blocks in the district had been asked to prepare a list of such panchayats. If required, the administration would install closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) in such panchayats to monitor the meetings, he said.

The administration would soon be organising a training programme for panchayat presidents and ward members, in all the 683 village panchayats in the district, to prevent such incidents, he said. Special resource persons and officials from the administration would conduct the training, he added. The police have formed a special team to nab the panchayat vice-president, Mohan Raj, who is at large.

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday strongly condemned the incident of the Dalit panchayat president, Ms. Rajeshwari, being forced to sit on the floor during panchayat meetings.

“The image of a representative elected by the people, through a democratic process, being made to sit on the floor is a shame for those involved in public life.

168,2020/10/12,"Olive Ridley turtle rescued, let into sea in Ramanathapuram","Earlier, people killed the reptile for its meat

The Forest Department in Ramanathapuram district on Sunday rescued an adult Olive Ridley turtle that was caught in a fishing net and released it into the Palk Bay at Panaikulam seashore on Sunday.

Ramanathapuram Forest Range Officer S. Sathish said that department personnel rushed to the spot on Sunday after local fishermen informed officials that an Olive Ridley turtle was caught in a fishing net.

The adult turtle weighed around 35 kg, the forest range officer said.

“Usually, the nesting season for Olive Ridley turtles starts by December. The mating of these turtles happen two months prior to the nesting. So, it is common to find turtles within one km from the shore during this time of the year. It is because of this reason that turtles often get entangled in the fishing net during this period,” he added.

But, it is important to safely rescue the turtles from the fishing nets without injuring them.

“Sometimes, fishermen tend to cut the turtle’s flippers in order to save the fishing net. Earlier, people used to kill the reptile for its meat. But through repeated awareness given to the fishermen, such instances rarely happen in the area nowadays,” he added. A.S. Marimuthu, Wildlife Warden, Ramanathapuram, said that the contact number of Forest Department officials were shared with the local residents and fishermen.

“The locals, especially the youth, are showing more interest in informing the officials whenever an Olive Ridley turtle is found in the region.

170,2020/10/12,Palaniswami is CM candidate: BJP leader,"BJP is part of the AIADMK front in Tamil Nadu, says Pon. Radhakrishnan

Former Union Minister and BJP leader Pon. Radhakrishnan on Sunday said the BJP in the State is part of the AIADMK front and Edappadi K. Palaniswami is the Chief Minister candidate.

Speaking to reporters, he said the AIADMK was the leader of the alliance in the State, in which the BJP was a trusted ally. The issue over the CM candidate within the AIADMK had been resolved amicably, he added.

Asked to comment on Information Minister Minister Kadambur Raju’s remark that Mr. Radhakrishnan had lost ground in his home town and that his observations need not be taken seriously, the BJP leader said the election would reveal who had popularity.

He said the BJP delegation would meet Mr. Palaniswami, who is expected to visit Kanniyakumari on Wednesday to review the COVID-19 situation.

He also appealed to the T.N. and Kerala governments to hold Navarathri celebrations as per tradition. The officials should follow COVID-19 protocol, but at the same time, observe traditions, he said.

Last week, the former Minister had said the BJP may even join hands with the DMK for the ensuing elections, which caused a flutter among the two parties. Though he blamed the media for misinterpreting his observations, the clarification on Sunday shows that the party high command had expressed its concern over his utterances, an office-bearer in the BJP said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/qr865a/article29551035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30PON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/palaniswami-is-cm-candidate-bjp-leader/article32829995.ece
171,2020/10/12,"Children take to music, dance and art online","Virtual extracurricular activities and after-school classes are now sought after

Theatre sessions through an app? Or how about meeting for an online book club session? With children having settled into an online class routine through their schools over the last few months, extracurricular activities aren’t far behind.

When the lockdown to curb COVID-19 started in March, Crea-Shakti was working with children for theatre in around 70 schools across south India, says founder and chief mentor Dushyanth Gunashekar.

“This number almost instantaneously reduced as schools themselves were grappling with how to begin classes online. For the last two years, we had been working on our drama-based learning app, Crea Play, which then began to evolve from being an app focussed on content for multidisciplinary learners,” he said.

Crea Play now has daily live classes, which use theatre to improve creativity, communication, writing and acting. Mr. Gunasekar says around 4,000 students have signed up. “It was initially a challenge for us — how do you take to the children something like theatre which essentially is not digital? We brainstormed and realised that the focus had to be on ensuring that the children had a platform to explore themselves, learn and most importantly, have fun at a time like this,” he said.

For teachers, taking art classes online has meant they have had to take another look at their curriculum to tailor it to the virtual medium and schedule classes in such a way that students don’t feel burdened.

“Several children have online classes at school throughout the week and it became important for me to ensure that they don’t feel overworked when they attend my piano class,” says Shameer Mohamed, a piano instructor from the city. He had never taken classes online before. His initial apprehensions have now given way to comfort. “Parents have told me how the students look forward to these music sessions. This is a welcome break for them,” he said.

Tvarita, a city-based performing arts centre, has seen more parents sign their children up for dance classes during the last six months, which the organisation has been conducting online. “Parents are trying to keep kids at home engaged and online dance classes are perfect for that. A good number of parents are also using the opportunity to expose their children to different activities and see what they take to and what they might be interested in, in the long run,” said Tvarita co-founders T.M. Sridevi and Deepthi Ravichandran.

For schools that have a full calendar during a regular academic year with regard to extracurricular activities, the focus is not just on hosting these classes online but also on events to encourage more participation. Students from SEED Academy had their first virtual book club session a week ago.

“We’ve had sessions in the past and decided to take them online for children above the age of 8. The kids were thrilled to have an opportunity to read and discuss a book,” says Vani Sastri, co-founder and managing director. The school has taken music, art and theatre online and Ms. Sastri says the feedback from parents has been overwhelmingly positive.

“We have always focused on holistic development, and giving children avenues to explore their creative side has been a high priority for us over the last six months,” she said.

Bhavan’s Rajaji Vidyashram took its annual inter-school cultural event ‘Astra’ online and had over 200 participants from 32 schools in the city. A talent show ‘Vel’s Talensia’ for children of ages 2 to 8 is now going on, hosted by Vel’s International Preschool.

DMK president M.K. Stalin has alleged that the current AIADMK government is engaged in large-scale corruption, and has warned that those involved will be brought to justice when his party comes to power.

“People did not vote for Edappadi K. Palaniswami to become Chief Minister. He was made Chief Minister because of the demise of Jayalalithaa. Now, he is saving that post by acting as a proxy to the BJP government at the Centre,” he said, addressing party cadre via videoconference at Mupperum Vizha, organised by the party’s Tiruvallur (south) unit. The AIADMK leaders know very well that they can’t come back to power, so they are trying to swindle whatever they can, Mr. Stalin said.

He said during the time of former Chief Minister Karunanidhi, Tamil Nadu was ranked third among industrial destinations in the country. It is in the 14th position now in the ease-of-business ranking. But the Chief Minister is boasting about the State attracting investments, he said.

He also said the Chief Minister had compromised the State’s autonomy on the GST compensation issue and pushed the State into a huge debt trap. The Chief Minister has also failed to tackle the spread of COVID-19, with the number of cases increasing, he said.

177,2020/10/12,‘MSP should have been part of new laws’,"Farmers will be bound by rates fixed by corporates, says Alagiri

Had Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intentions been genuine, the Centre would have ensured that a provision on the continuation of minimum support price was mentioned in the farm Acts, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said on Sunday.

He was speaking at a rally organised by the party in Tiruvannamalai to protest against the Acts.

Mr. Alagiri criticised the BJP-led government for the manner in which the Bills were passed in Parliament, and for failing to consult the States. “Mr. Modi is saying that minimum support price is there and will continue. It is not mentioned in the Acts. Without something being written in legislation, it has no legal validity...,” he said.

A number of Congress MPs, MLAs, TNCC working presidents and other leaders took part at the rally.

Under the new laws, the concept of MSP would get abolished, Mr. Alagiri said. Farmers would be bound by the rates fixed by corporates, and they would end up doing contract-farming.

Small and marginal farmers would be the worst affected.

“Mr. Modi has destroyed public enterprises. Now he is bent on destroying India’s agriculture,” he said.

Former Union Minister P. Chidambaram, who addressed the rally through video-conference, said 94% of the farmers sold their produce outside ‘mandis’ and only 6% were selling through Agricultural Produce Market Committees. The law had made the life of a farmer more difficult.

“Mr. Modi says this system will do away with brokers. This system will only bring in more brokers on behalf of the corporates,” he said.

AICC secretary in charge of T.N. Sirivella Prasad asked why the government issued an ordinance and passed the Bills in a hurry when no association of farmers sought any change in farm trade. “The T.N. government is betraying the people by supporting these Acts,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ouv8io/article32829396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THALAGIRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/msp-should-have-been-part-of-new-laws/article32829397.ece
178,2020/10/12,Tenders invited for setting up of several fish landing centres,"Projects expected to help prevent sea erosion

The Fisheries Department has called for tenders for several fish landing centres, including a common one for Pudhupattinam and Uyyalikuppam in Kancheepuram district, at a cost of ₹15.76 crore.

Helen Nagar in Kanniyakumari will get a landing centre at a cost of ₹13.40 crore and Rajakkamangalam village in the same district will get one for ₹13.15 crore. Tenders have also been floated for a facility at Rosema Nagar in Ramanathapuram, which would be constructed at a cost of ₹9.46 crore and one in Thalanguda in Cuddalore district for ₹12.37 crore.

These projects are expected to be completed in 12-18 months and would help prevent sea erosion at these locations, explained a source in the department.

Selvam, a fisherman of Cuddalore, said that as in any other coastal locality, sea erosion was a major problem in his district. “What is needed is a larger study to safeguard the coastline. The sea is some 5 km away from our village, it has now inched closer and is only a kilometre from here,” he said.

K. Bharathi of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association, said that though the landing centres were a welcome move, a wholesome study of erosion, sea level increase and the coastline was a must. “A long term plan must be drawn up to ensure a safe future for the coastal communities,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tenders-invited-for-setting-up-of-several-fish-landing-centres/article32829287.ece
179,2020/10/12,"Self-medication can prove fatal, says expert","‘It can also have long-term effects’

It’s been more than seven months that people are being flooded with various aspects of COVID-19. Yet, a few patients relied on self-medication and the disease only aggravated in them. Professor of Pulmonology at Government and General Hospital, Erragadda, Dr M Narender said that fearing stigma, some patients bought drugs over the counter or followed a prescription issued to other COVID-19 patients. When their health condition worsened, the patients were rushed to government hospitals.

Stressing that this was observed only in a few patients, the pulmonologist cautioned people to consult doctors who have been attending COVID-19 patients immediately after testing positive. “The kind of medicines prescribed, their dosage change from patient to patient depending on age, severity of COVID-19, co-morbidities such as diabetes, and other factors. One prescription does not serve all patients. Self-medication can worsen their health condition and can have long-term effects also,” Dr Narender said.

Doctors who attend to COVID-19 patients stressed multiple times that regardless of whether COVID-19 is mild or severe, consulting the doctors immediately after testing positive for the disease helps in early recovery. Since there is no cure for COVID-19, doctors are relying on drugs or medical procedures to treat complications arising out of the infectious disease.

A few medicines are given to avoid worsening of the infectious disease. Severity of infection, presence of diabetes, hypertension or other complications, are taken into consideration before prescribing medicines. Dr Narender said that a patient neglected medicines prescribed to him and started to consume an alternative form of medicine. “He developed complications and died,” the pulmonologist said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/self-medication-can-prove-fatal-says-expert/article32837511.ece
180,2020/10/12,Release funds to compensate for losses,"Finance Minister seeks one-time compensation for losses due to lower share recommended by 15th Finance Commission

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao has demanded that the Central government release the amounts to meet the losses suffered by the State on account of recommendations made by the 15th Finance Commission.

The Minister said the Finance Panel had reduced the share of the State in the divisible pool of tax devolution from 2.43 % to 2.13 %. Telangana was expected to suffer losses in devolution to the tune of ₹ 723 crore and the Centre should release the amounts to the State as one-time grant as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission.

He said that the formula of the Finance Commission had adversely affected developing states like Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka. He suggested that the Finance Panel should instead consider the formula on the basis of the capital expenditure and population of the respective States so that developing States would benefit from the package.

The Minister made this remarks while participating in the 43rd meeting of the Goods and Services Tax Council headed by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman through video-conference on Monday. The meeting follows the Centre and states meeting last Monday where a consensus could not be reached on the issue of borrowing to make up for the compensation shortfall.

Mr. Harish Rao recalled Section 7 (2) of the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 prescribed that the compensation payable to the State should be released at the end of every two months and this should be mandatorily paid from the compensation fund.

The Centre should ensure that the GST cess and other such amounts, as might be recommended by the GST Council, should be credited to the GST Compensation Fund, a non-lapsable fund forming part of the public account and should be utilized for the purposes specified in the GST Act. On the options proposed by the Centre for borrowing by the States, he said the Centre had proposed tht the States to borrow ₹ 1.1 lakh crore for losses arising from transition to the GST whereas according to the revised estimtes the total losses incurred by the States was ₹ 1.83 lakh crore.

“The difference comes to ₹ 73,000 crore. Since this is not a large amount, the Centre should take steps to compensate the States to that extent,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/release-funds-to-compensate-for-losses/article32837367.ece
181,2020/10/12,Telangana to focus on alternative crops to maize for Yasangi,"Minister tells officials to identify crops with high market demand

The State government has decided to discourage cultivation of maize for the second successive agricultural season in a row keeping in view the prevailing adverse marketing conditions for the crop with huge stock of the crop lying at national and international level.

Minister for Agriculture Singireddy Niranjan Reddy held a video conference with the all district agriculture officers (DAOs) and other senior officers of the Agriculture Department and discussed about alternative crops to maize that could be cultivated during the Yasangi (Rabi) season. It was decided at the virtual meeting to identify crops that have demand in the market could be cultivated instead of maize and take the matter to the Chief Minister’s notice for taking a final decision.

Thanking the farming community in the State for following the regulated farming practice during the Vanakalam (Kharif) season, the Minister said the government had decided to allow cultivation of maize during Yasangi at the beginning of this year’s agricultural season but the national and international conditions had forced the government to change its view since the chances of farmers not getting the support price and suffering huge losses was very high.

The Minister told the agriculture officers and agriculture extension officers to educate the farming community about the impending chances of suffering huge losses with maize cultivation. He directed the officials to identify the areas suitable for cultivation of greengram, blackgram, bengalgram, sunflower, mustard, sesamum and other crops, which have demand in the market and have support price, this season so that they could be encouraged.

Noting that COVID-19 pandemic had forced many sections of people who were living in the urban areas to return to rural areas, the Minister said such reverse migration was expected to increase the extent of Yasangi cultivation this year and could be around 72 lakh acres. He asked the officials to keep the seed of crops being planned available to the farming community.

On fertilizers, the Minister said the Centre had allotted 18.3 lakh tonnes, including 10 lakh tonnes of urea, for the Yasangi season and directed the officials to take all precautions for proper and complaint-free supply of urea and other fertilizers keeping in mind the experiences during the Vanakalam season. He also instructed the officials to speed up construction of rythu vedika buildings and complete them by Dasara.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cu0d0s/article32836797.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy12Niranjan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-to-focus-on-alternative-crops-to-maize-for-yasangi/article32836798.ece

A special session of the legislature exclusively to enact some new laws will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Assembly will meet on the first day and the Legislative Council thre next day to pass Bills for the purpose.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had decided to convene the brief two-day session to pass amendments to the GHMC Act including reservation of 50% of the 150 divisions to women.

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao has directed officials to get ready for paddy procurement. Procurement centers can be started tomorrow itself. depending upon the requirement, he said.

Participating in a review meeting held here on Monday over procurement and cultivation of crops, Mr. Harish Rao said the crop was expected to come to harvest after Dasara and at some places like Chegunta crop was already drying up. He said that State-wide paddy was sown in 54 lakh acres while it was 79,200 acres in the district. Noting that some 6,000 procurement centers are being established, he underlined the need for more centers in the district. Officials told the Minister that the number of centers are being doubled to 130 for paddy procurement.

The Minister directed the officials to get ready with required gunny bags and tarpaulins at the centers. He was informed that 700 tarpaulins had already been ordered. He directed the officials to create awareness among farmers to limit the moisture content below 17 % so that paddy can be procured without delay and payment would be made within three days.

Referring to procurement of cotton, Mr. Harish Rao said that the crop cultivation has increased to 3.75 lakh acres in the district.

MLA Ch. Kranthi Kiran suggested that more vehicles be deployed to transport paddy and to speed up the process of unloading at rice mills.

Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) official, Amarnath Reddy, said that 16 ginning mills will procure cotton in addition to five market yards. He has anticipated the problem of moisture and warehouse. He said that due to global and local conditions already procured cotton could not be cleared from warehouses and hence they need space to stock that was procured last year. He said that the CCI can purchase cotton only if moisture content is between 8% and 12 %. The Minister directed the officials to create awareness among farmers in this regard.

Mr. Harish Rao expressed serious concern over slow progress of work on rythu vedikas and directed officials to complete them within deadline of Dasara.

Kavitha of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has been elected to Legislative Council from the Nizamabad Local Authorities Constituency with a huge majority. Counting of votes of the polling held on October 9 was taken up on Monday morning.

According to the information reaching here, Ms. Kavitha, daughter of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, has secured a majority of 672 votes over her nearest rival from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of the 823 votes polled by electors comprising councillor of municipal councils, corporators of municipal corporations, MPTC members of Mandal Parishads and ZPTC members of Zilla Parishads.

Of the total votes polled, Ms. Kavitha secured 728 followed by 56 to the BJP candidate and 29 to the Congress candidate. Another 10 votes were declared invalid.

The counting of votes commenced after 8 am and the exercise was completed in two rounds. In the first round in which 600 votes were counted, Ms. Kavitha secured 531 votes followed by 39 to BJP and 22 to Congress candidates with 8 votes declared invalid. In the second round, 223 votes were counted with Ms. Kavitha secured 197 votes followed by 17 by BJP candidate and 7 by Congress candidates and another two votes were declared invalid.

“We have already booked three teachers of the school affiliated with the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) outfit,” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar said.

According to the police, one of the school's alumni, Sajjad Bhat, was an accused in the February 2019 Pulwama suicide attack, which left 40 CRPF jawans dead.

“Some of the students who had become militants had already left us and were home for a longer period before joining the militant ranks,” a Srinagar-based local newsagency Kashmir News Service quoted Mr. Mattoo as saying.

The Shiromani Akali Dal on Monday said the Punjab government should in the next seven days convene a special Assembly session to declare the entire State a notified ‘mandi’ (principal market area) and reject the Centre’s recent agriculture laws. It should also repeal its own amended APMC Act of 2017.

Also read: The Hindu Explains | Who gains and who loses from the farm Bills?

The SAD core committee announced that in the event of the State government’s refusal to convene the session, the party would ‘gherao’ Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s residence. The meeting was chaired by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal here.

Harcharan Bains, principal adviser to the SAD president, said: “The ultimatum to Amarinder Singh has become necessary in view of the CM’s continued refusal to take a clear stand against the Central anti-farmer Acts, besides his stubborn refusal to declare the entire State a principal market area where the Center’s Acts would no longer be implementable.”

The SAD core committee also decided to take up the issue of early reopening of the Kartarpur corridor with the External Affairs Ministry soon to ensure Sikh pilgrims could pay obeisance at the shrine in Pakistan during the run up to the 551th ‘Parkash Purab’ of Sri Guru Nanak Dev.

The committee also expressed serious concern at the mishandling of the Hathras incident by the Uttar Pradesh government and asked it to ensure the victim’s family received justice by taking exemplary action against police officials who had cremated the body forcibly, said Mr. Bains.

Capt. Amarinder Singh said convening the session to negate the laws was his government’s prerogative and the SAD had neither the moral right nor any political standing to dictate terms to him or his government in the matter.

“It was ridiculous that the party which had boycotted the last Vidhan Sabha session to avoid voting for the resolution against the farm laws was now so desperate about convening the next session to reject those very legislations,” he said.

With less than a month left for the byolls for two Assembly seats in Odisha, the Biju Janata Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party have fielded sons of the deceased MLAs, who had represented Tirtol and Balasore Sadar seats.

The ruling BJD on Monday announced Bijaya Shankar Das for Tirtol represented by his father late Bishnu Charan Das.

He would cross swords with BJP candidate Rajkishore Behera, who had left the Congress recently, in the reserved seat for Scheduled Caste candidates.

The BJP fielded Manas Kumar Dutta in Balasore Sadar seat which fell vacant after his father former MLA Madan Mohan Dutta had died of cardiac arrest in June last. Swarup Kumar Das, who had a successful stint in the civic body elections, is BJD candidate.

The two next generation politicians in their early thirties have already plunged into campaign trail seeking votes in the name of their late fathers.

Bishnu Charan Das, a veteran BJD leader, had won Tirtol in 2019. But he had won the Jagatsinghpur seat for five consecutive times between 1990 and 2014. He was a Minister in the Naveen Patnaik government and was also elected to the Upper House of Parliament. Known for his organisational calibre, the late BJD leader had huge following in Jagatsinghpur district.

Bijay Kumar exuded confidence that his victory margin would be 50,000. “However, our key issues will be unemployment and issues of farmers which were duly addressed by the BJD government,” he said.

On the other hand, Manas Kumar said, “My father was very popular in Balasore. He was always available when people needed him the most. I have confidence on the good will my father used to carry.” Madan Mohan Dutta, as BJP candidate, had won the Balasore Sadar seat for the first time in 2019.

I say that one such person, Mrs. Dimple Thawani, made patently false and bogus allegations against me knowing them to be false, to mislead the investigation in the above case.”

The allegation was that Sushant had dropped Ms. Chakraborty at her residence in his car on June 13, a day before his death. Ms. Chakraborty said, “This is utterly false and that the conduct makes out a prima facie case punishable under Sections 203 and 211 of the Indian Penal Code.”

Her lawyer Satish Maneshinde also said, “We will be forwarding a list of people to CBI who made fake and false claims on TV and electronic media including carrying mobile recording and fake stories on SSR case with particular reference to Rhea Chakraborty to go after them and record their statements. We will request the CBI to take legal proceedings against them for misleading the investigations.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/v51eiq/article32798631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07-Sonam--RheG8V7R882J3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rhea-chakraborty-wants-cbi-to-take-action-against-her-neighbour/article32836298.ece

The family of the 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras, who died days after she was brutally assaulted and allegedly raped, on Monday appeared before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court and recorded their statements.

While a detailed written order was still awaited, lawyers for the victim and the Uttar Pradesh government said the court had listed the next hearing for November 2, when the State has been asked to file a response.

A division bench of the court was hearing a PIL petition listed by it in the matter after taking suo motu cognizance of the incident and the events leading up to the hurried and alleged forced cremation of the victim.

U.P. Advocate General V. K. Shahi said the government filed an affidavit in the court.

The court questioned Additional Chief Secretary Home Awanish Awasthi, ADG Law and Order Prashant Kumar and the Hathras District Magistrate, said Mr. Shahi after the hearing but he refused to divulge further details.

The court directed Mr. Kumar and Special Secretary Home to appear on November 2.

Lawyer for the victim's family Seema Kushwaha said the family had three main prayers in court and all of them have been considered. First, the family demanded that the case be transferred out of U.P. Second, the details of the investigation not be revealed through media as it “builds a different kind of narrative”. Third, the family demanded that they be provided security till the trial in the case was concluded.

Ms. Kushwaha stated that she would submit an affidavit on behalf of the family before November 2.

‘Police left speechless’

The police maintained their stand that the cremation of the girl took place with the family’s permission but were without answers and left “speechless” when the court cross-questioned them. The family wanted the cremation at 5 a.m., but the police did it at night without their presence and without following proper rituals, she said.

The court used “hard language” while asking the State officials that if they had felt that law and order could be affected during the hurried cremation episode why didn’t they summon more force, she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/srszd6/article32835758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HATHRASKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/in-high-court-hathras-victim-family-members-record-statements/article32835760.ece

The floor crossing came within a hours of strong condemnation by the CLP leader Okram Ibobi Singh and the senior leader K. Ranjit of the way relief was being distributed to the poor.

Mr Ibobi Singh said, “It is shameful that some politicians who had recently joined the BJP are playing politics on the distribution of free rice to the people of slender means. They had given 10 kg of free rice to those who had joined the BJP and others, including the Congress activists, were given just 5 kg in the Wangjing Tentha Assembly constituency which goes to by-polls on November 7.”

K. Ranjit said, “Some MLAs have been crossing and re-crossing the floor with such frequency that all elected members have been reduced to laughing stock.”

Mr. Mangi, popularly known as “CPI Mangi”, had carved his niche in the Left party and served as minister from the party. A senior politician said, “For narrow political gains he had joined the BJP. But he later joined the Congress to become its vice president. Now he has returned to the BJP again. Nobody can say what party he will join in the coming days.”

Oinam Nabakishore had joined the Congress after his retirement.

211,2020/10/12,Indian Premier League 2020 | Bayliss calls for better plan execution,"Sunrisers Hyderabad has to ensure it executes its plans better, says head coach Trevor Bayliss.

After the loss to Rajasthan Royals on Sunday, Bayliss said the team had batted well on a slow surface, but could have done with a few more runs.

“But credit to them (Royals). They bowled extremely well on that surface. It is all about adjusting to it,” he said. “Any loss is difficult, obviously we were in a good position for almost three-quarters of the match.”

However, there had been several positives, Bayliss said.

“We just got to concentrate on those positives and work on some of the negatives and make it better in the next game,"" Bayliss said.

212,2020/10/12,CSK needs to dig itself out of a crater,"Even winning six of its remaining seven matches may not be enough

CSK finds itself in a hole at the halfway mark — just two victories and five defeats.

The side needs to win six of its remaining seven matches and even then, may have to reckon with net run-rate. There is a remote possibility of CSK going through with seven wins overall provided many other results go its way.

From the time the prolific Suresh Raina, at the pivotal No. 3, flew home because of personal reasons, things have gone wrong for CSK.

Baffling

Tactically, CSK has been baffling. The Chennai outfit is a side of multi-dimensional cricketers but these men are of little consequence if they surface too late in the order.

For instance, Dhoni arrived in the 15th over against RCB. Ideally, the skipper should have surfaced at No. 3 and given himself the space, time and freedom to bat through the innings.

Ravindra Jadeja has been indifferent with the ball, but CSK has not utilised his immense batting ability. The southpaw needs to walk out when there are enough overs left.

Somehow CSK, save openers Shane Watson and Faf du Plessis, has not been dishing out smart cricket. Ambati Rayudu has been charging quick bowlers and missing his shots rather than caressing them with footwork and timing as he did in 2018.

N. Jagadeesan showed promise on debut, but CSK needs some serious rethinking on its composition.

In bowling, someone as skilful as Josh Hazlewood can swing games in Dubai where there is assistance for pacemen. Sam Curran, zestful and enthusiastic, has his limitations. Mitchell Santner is a match-winning, left-arm spinning all-rounder and he is warming the bench.

Energy-booster

Then there is Imran Tahir, who can create a buzz on the field and lift the side with his energy.

213,2020/10/12,Started sample collection of IPL players in the UAE: NADA,"It is understood that NADA’s own Dope Control Officers (DCOs), who were due to fly to the UAE in the second week of September, are awaiting for necessary approval for the trip.

The National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) on Monday said it has started collecting samples of players competing in the Indian Premier League in the UAE after enlisting personnel from Dubai.

The agency posted a tweet to confirm the move.

“NADA India had engaged sample collection personnel in Dubai for dope testing of cricketers participating in IPL 2020. We have already commenced dope testing on Indian as well as International cricketers participating in IPL,” NADA tweeted from its official handle.

When NADA DG Naveen Agarwal was asked, he told PTI: “The sample collection of players for dope testing has already started a few days back. I wouldn’t like to comment beyond that.”

It is understood that NADA’s own Dope Control Officers (DCOs), who were due to fly to the UAE in the second week of September, are awaiting for necessary approval for the trip.

The BCCI came under NADA’s ambit last year and since then, the agency has deputed its DCOs at domestic as well as international matches at home for sample collection.

214,2020/10/12,Indian Premier League 2020 | A.B. de Villiers’ masterful blitz flattens Kolkata Knight Riders,"His unbeaten 73 comes off just 33 deliveries; shares an unbeaten 100-run stand with Kohli

When A.B. de Villiers finds form, there is not much the bowlers can do, as Kolkata Knight Riders found out at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Monday. The blistering 73 not out off just 33 balls (5x4, 6x6) from the South African genius powered Royal Challengers Bangalore to an 82-run victory.

The fifth win also took RCB to the third spot on the IPL table. On a night when de Villiers ruled, skipper Virat Kohli (33 not out, 28b, 1x4) was content to play the spectator’s role during their unbroken 100-run stand for the third-wicket.

The de Villiers show began with a straight drive off Prasidh Krishna; not even the stumps at the bowler’s end could take the power off the shot. He then plundered 18 off Kamlesh Nagarkoti’s last over, smashing him for two massive sixes on the on-side off successive balls.

Earlier, Aaron Finch (47, 37b, 44, 1x6) and Devdutt Padikkal (32, 23b, 4x4, 1x6) put on 67 for the first wicket, justifying Kohli’s decision to bat first. Chasing a formidable target, KKR would have appreciated a solid start from the new opening pair of Shubman Gill and Tom Banton, who was making his IPL debut. It didn’t prove a particularly memorable beginning for the highly rated 21-year-old from England.

He was bowled by a Navdeep Saini delivery clocked at 148.1kmph. It nipped back and took the inside edge before dislodging the off and middle stumps.

RCB could soon hear that sweet sound of the ball hitting the stumps again, as Nitish Rana was beaten in his attempt to slog-sweep the impressive Washington Sundar.

Watching all this from the other end was Gill (34, 25b, 3x4, 1x6), who seemed to be shaping up for another significant score. He was dropped on 31 by Finch at long-on off Yuzvendra Chahal, but failed to capitalise on it; he was run out, courtesy a fine effort from Isuru Udana and wicketkeeper de Villiers.

KKR plunged into deeper trouble in the next over when captain Dinesh Karthik was castled by Chahal. Four balls later, Eoin Morgan was sent back by Sundar. Half the side was back in the dugout with the score on 64.

Only a series of mighty sixes from Andre Russell could have revived KKR’s hopes, but the giant only managed one before holing out to extra cover off Udana.

215,2020/10/12,IPL 2020 | Faltering CSK up against SRH with resurrection in mind,"Considered one of the most successful chasers in the history of IPL with a chase-master in Dhoni, CSK’s batting struggle this year can be gauged from the fact that all their defeats came while going after targets.

Time is fast running out for the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led Chennai Super Kings, a team which desperately needs its batting to click when it takes on Sunrisers Hyderabad here on Tuesday, in a battle to keep its IPL hopes alive.

The three-time champions and last edition’s runner-up, CSK are seeking a revival of fortunes after suffering five defeats in seven games.

They are currently at the penultimate position in the eight-team standings halfway into the tournament.

Considered one of the most successful chasers in the history of IPL with a chase-master in Dhoni, CSK’s batting struggle this year can be gauged from the fact that all their defeats came while going after targets.

While Shane Watson and Faf du Plessis have had decent outings so far, CSK need a stronger show from its faltering middle order too.

After facing brickbats for persisting with Kedar Jadhav, CSK dropped him in their last match and his replacement Narayan Jagadeesan (33 off 28) made a decent score in the company of Ambati Rayudu (42 off 40). However, CSK’s chase fell apart after the duo departed.

The likes of Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja and Dwayne Bravo too failed to come to the team’s rescue.

Dhoni himself has not been able to force the pace while chasing and the skipper had no qualms in admitting the flaws in his batting department.

“Batting has been bit of a worry. We need to do something about it,” Dhoni had said.

“I think we are better off playing the other way round - play the big shots and even if you get out, it is fine because we can’t leave too many after the 15th or the 16th over. That just puts too much pressure on the lower order batsmen.”

On the bowling front, Deepak Chahar and Jadeja were impressive the other night and Bravo’s return was a welcome relief but the likes of Curran, Shardul Thakur and Karn Sharma need to pull up their performances.

The tie also provides Dhoni and Co. a chance to avenge their seven-run loss to SRH in their previous outing.

SRH bowling concerns

SRH, on the other hand, are a only a tad better-placed than CSK at the fifth spot with three wins from seven games.

But the the five-wicket defeat to Rajasthan Royals on Sunday would be hurting the Hyderabad outfit badly as at one stage, they looked in complete control after posting a competitive 158 for 4.

Batting has not been SRH’s concern at all as the likes of Jonny Bairstow, skipper David Warner, Manish Pandey and Kane Williamson are all among runs and have the ability to shoulder the responsibility on their own.

But it is the bowling unit which let SRH down on Sunday.

Despite losing senior pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh to injuries, SRH have shown tremendous fighting abilities with Rashid Khan and yorker specialist T. Natarajan doing the job for the side.

But on Sunday SRH let Royals off the hook in the middle overs after reducing them to 78 for 5.

The likes of Sandeep Sharma, Khaleel Ahmed and young Abhishek Sharma are the weak links in bowling which they need to address.

Teams (from):

Chennai Super Kings: MS Dhoni (C), M Vijay, Ambati Rayudu, Faf du Plessis, Shane Watson, Kedar Jadhav, Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Lungi Ngidi, Deepak Chahar, Piyush Chawla, Imran Tahir, Mitchell Santner, Josh Hazlewood, Shardul Thakur, Sam Curran, N Jagadeesan, KM Asif, Monu Kumar, R Sai Kishore, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Karn Sharma.

216,2020/10/12,IPL 2020 | KKR hopeful of early resolution to Sunil Narine being reported for suspect action,"The franchise, however, did not say whether he will be left out of the team

Two-time IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders on Monday hoped that there would be an “appropriate resolution” to the issue of their spinner Sunil Narine being reported for a suspect bowling action, expressing surprise at the development.

The franchise, however, did not say whether he will be left out of the team. Narine has been placed in the warning list and one more reporting of his action by the on-field umpires could lead to him being barred from bowling in the ongoing event.

“This came as a surprise to the franchise considering that he has played over 115 games in the IPL since 2012 and as many as 68 games since 2015, when he was last reported during the IPL season for a suspect action,” KKR said in a statement.

“We are hopeful that there would be an appropriate resolution quickly. We appreciate the cooperation being extended by the IPL in expediting this matter,” added the statement, which came ahead of their clash against Royal Challengers Bangalore here.

The 32-year-old picked up two wickets in his four overs against KXIP to help in KKR’s dramatic two-run win, while defending 165.

In 2015, Narine served suspension from bowling in international cricket after his action was declared illegal by the ICC. But he was cleared to bowl in all formats in 2016 after undergoing corrective measures.

“Furthermore, he was playing his 6th game this season, with no concerns expressed formally or informally by the match officials so far.”

“Having said this, we are respectful of the process that the IPL has put in place to have his action reviewed, and are working closely with the IPL in this matter. We are hopeful that there would be an appropriate resolution quickly.

217,2020/10/12,New ICC Chairman: Nomination for potential candidates by October 18,"However, the global body has not specified the voting procedure in case there are multiple candidates.

The ICC on Monday set October 18 as the deadline for its Board of Directors to send names of potential candidates for the chairman’s post to replace Shashank Manohar, ending the impasse on the nomination procedure.

The process will be overseen by an independent chairman of the ICC Audit Committee.

However, the global body has not specified the voting procedure in case there are multiple candidates.

That is precisely the reason, ICC has stated that the next chairman might assume office only from the month of December.

“The process, which is being overseen by the Independent Chairman of the ICC Audit Committee, has commenced and the first stage is for the nominations of potential candidates to be made by current Board Directors by 18 October 2020,” ICC stated in a release.

“The International Cricket Council Board today confirmed the process for the election of its next Chairperson is underway and is expected to be concluded by early December,” it further stated.

The process of nomination, however, remains the same where a current Board of Director nominates a candidate and is seconded by another director.

218,2020/10/12,Bangladesh cancels BPL 2020 due to COVID-19,"The decision was taken keeping in mind the participation of foreign cricketers and other logistics, said BCB president.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has been forced to cancel this year’s Bangladesh Premier League T20 tournament in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The decision was announced by BCB president Nazmul Hasan on Sunday.

“BPL is not happening this year,” Nazmul told reporters while launching the inaugural edition of the three-team 50-over tournament at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium here.

“Let’s see it in next year. We do not want to miss any game but everything will depend on the situation and circumstances.”

He said the decision was taken keeping in mind the participation of foreign cricketers and other logistics.

“Because whenever there is talk of BPL, there must be foreign cricketers. At the same time there is the matter of production. Now if we can do those in Bangladesh then we have no objection.

“But it is a little bigger arrangement because of the number of players there and the team management are much higher. I don’t know if we are able to handle that or not,” Hasan said.

The BCB chief also ruled out the possibility of shifting the tournament in a foreign land, just like the Indian Premier League which is currently being held closed-doors in the UAE.

“I don’t think it will be easy (host the tournament outside). I tell you, when we go to run in Bangladesh (BPL), except for one or two franchises, the rest of us have a hard time to play the tournament,” Hasan said.

“I heard it today the bio-security belt has to be created outside say in the UK and even in Dubai for the IPL as well and I don’t think it is possible for anyone. It is almost impossible for us to spend so much money.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bangladesh-cancels-bpl-2020-due-to-covid-19/article32832780.ece

Rahul Tewatia always had self-belief that he can take the game deep during tough chases and win it for his team, something he did for the second time in this edition of Indian Premier League.

Also read: Indian Premier League 2020 | Tewatia and Parag pull off a thriller

Tewatia helped the Royals eke out a five-wicket victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad with a 28-ball 45 not out to snap their four-match losing streak in the IPL.

Tewatia recently hit five sixes in one over from Sheldon Cottrell during an eaarlier game against Kings XI Punjab, which catapulted him into national fame.

“The wickets were falling so I just wanted to hold one end up and wait for the boundary balls. I knew if I keep my self-belief and take it deep, I could pull it off,” Tewati said at the post-match presentation.

“I told Riyan [Parag] that the wicket was playing slow and the deeper we take it, the better our chances, even if we needed 50 off the last 4 because we have the shots,” added Tewatia who was adjudged man of the match.

Talking about the chat he had with Riyan Parag, who also remained not out on 42, in the middle, Tewatia said, “Riyan asked me what to do. I told him to respect the good balls and take singles, and I could take on the attack.”

“Against Rashid, I saw the opportunity to play the reverse sweep and took it.”

He said he was relishing the role given to him by the team management.

“This was the role given to me and it was clear from a long time. I was batting well for a while and I was confident and was hitting them well when we played practice games. So it’s easy when you know your role.”

Asked about an incident involving SRH bowler Khaleel Ahmed, he said, “No big deal, we just got taken away in the heat of the moment.”

Royals captain Steve Smith praised Tewatia and “young kid” Parag for showing great composure.

“I don’t think it was the easiest wicket and the square boundaries are quite big too. So great composure from Parag. Proud that he could come back in and score some runs straight up,” said the star Australian batsman.

“Stokesy obviously didn’t come off tonight. Our top four didn’t fire, but today we showed our depth. With Stokesy back, it brings a nice balance to us. He’s been impressive, hasn’t he? Just thrives in pressure situations. You bring in his bowling and fielding to it and he’s a terrific player for us.”

SRH captain David Warner admitted his team did not play its best.

”... we didn’t mis-execute, but some of the decisions at the top of the mark weren’t there. And we probably bowled the wrong ball at the wrong time,” he said.

“But lots of positives coming out and we’ll take it on to the next game. We need to work out as these wickets get tired, how to bat through the first 6 and the middle, and then assess with our bowling.”

Asked why he chose to hold back spinner Rashid Khan longer, Warner said, “We’ve done it in the past, we’ve held him back and try and nullify some runs, but these two [Tewatia and Parag] played exceptionally well.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/oo1c3n/article32830692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-TEWATIA-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-srh-vs-rr-i-knew-i-could-take-the-match-deep-and-win-it-tewatia/article32830693.ece
220,2020/10/12,"Indian Premier League 2020, MI vs DC | Injured Rishabh Pant is out for at least one week: Shreyas Iyer","Pant had injured himself in the match against Rajasthan Royals on Friday.

Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer on Sunday said wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant will be out for at least a week due to a hamstring injury he suffered recently.

Pant had injured himself in the match against Rajasthan Royals on Friday.

DC missed Pant as they slumped to a five-wicket defeat against defending champions Mumbai Indians on Sunday and lost the top place in the points table.

Australia’s Alex Carey replaced Pant in the playing eleven.

Iyer said the team is still in the dark about the India stumper’s return.

“We have no idea [on Rishabh’s availability], the doctor said he has to rest for a week and hope he comes back really strong,” Iyer said at the post match presentation ceremony.

Opting to bat, DC made competitive 162 for four, a target which MI chased down with two balls to spare and Iyer admitted that they were 10-15 runs short.

“Definitely, I would say 10-15 short, 170-175 on the board would have looked completely different. We really missed out when Stoinis got out, he was hitting the ball really well and also seeing the ball like a football, that was the main error that we did and something that we really need to work on,” he said.

Iyer also lamented DC’s poor effort on the field on Sunday.

“Apart from that the effort we put on the field, we could definitely work on that as there were a few misfields and dropped catches as well. Overall they outplayed us in all the departments. We need to work on our mindsets before the next game.”

He said despite looking one of the top teams in this year’s IPL, DC still need to work on certain aspects of the game going forward.

“If we could have squeezed in two more wickets after the powerplay we would have been on top. It is really important for us not to take any team lightly and be positive in our approach. There are still certain elements we have to work and we will use the break to work on that.”

Winning skipper Rohit Sharma was happy with the efforts put in by his teammates so far in the tournament.

“The kind of cricket we are playing gives us a lot of confidence. It’s important to have momentum with us, and it was a perfect day for us, getting those crucial two points. We did everything right, but there are still some things we can improve on,” he said.

“We were good with the ball and restricted them to 160-odd. Clinical with the bat, but not so much towards the end. We need one set batsman to finish off the game in general, and some set batsmen got out today, but I don’t want to point fingers because chasing has been difficult in this tournament.

221,2020/10/12,Students’ groups hold protests against high DU cut-offs,"The protests were held by the KYS and SFI which alleged that high cut-offs favour students of big private schools and demanded more transparency in the admission process.

Students’ groups on Monday staged protests here against the Delhi University (DU) administration over the high cut-offs announced for undergraduate admission.

The protests were held by the Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS) and the Left-affiliated Students’ Federation of India (SFI). They alleged that high cut-offs favour students of big private schools and demanded more transparency in the admission process.

DU announced its first cut-off list for undergraduate admission on Saturday with Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College for Women pegging the score at 100 % for three Honours courses.

The 100 % cut-off for undergraduate admissions in DU comes after a gap of five years.

Activists of the KYS burnt an effigy of the cut-off list to highlight its “discriminatory nature” and demanded that it be done away with immediately, the students’ group said in a statement.

“This cut-off that is decided on the basis of marks scored by students of big private schools is nothing but a policy of ensuring that the most marginalised student does not have any access to quality higher education. This ensures that students who bear the brunt of substandard public-funded school education are turned away from public-funded universities,” they said.

KYS activists were detained by police during the protest.

Twenty activists of the KYS were protesting at the Arts Faculty, North Campus, a senior police officer said.

“Eight of them were detained when they refused to disperse. They were taken to Maurice Nagar police station,” the officer said.

Meanwhile, the SFI submitted a memorandum to the university vice chancellor “regarding the unfair and unjustifiably high cut-offs for undergraduate admissions,” it said in a statement.

The memorandum was submitted by SFI Delhi president Sumit Kataria, it said.

“We strongly demand a transparent admission process and we stand firmly against such exclusionary methods that only favour the high society,” it added.

While the 100 % cut-offs have been a matter of debate, the required marks were expected to be higher this year as over 1.84 lakh students scored above 90 % and more than 41,000 students scored above 95 % marks in CBSE Class 12 exams.

LSR College has pegged 100 % score for three courses for general category aspirants -- BA (Hons) Economics, BA (Hons) Political Science and BA (Hons) Psychology.

The college has the highest cut-off among Science courses as well. It has announced a cut-off of 99.75 % for admission to B.Sc (Hons) Statistics for general category students, while Hindu College has pegged the score for the same course at 99.25 %.

Hindu College has announced a cut-off of 99.33 % for B.Sc (Hons) Physics.

Attacking the BJP, AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that the three “anti-farmer” laws should be withdrawn and the BJP had “left farmers to die”.

Addressing farmers from Punjab at Jantar Mantar, Mr. Kejriwal said, “AAP opposes these three anti-farmer laws and we demand that these three laws should be withdrawn. Secondly, a law should be brought that 100% produce will be purchased at MSP (Minimum Support Price) and farmers will get 1.5 times their cost. I support your demands and stand with you along with the people of Delhi.”

He said that in 2014, before the election, the BJP had promised the implementation of the Swaminathan Committee report which said that the MSP would be 1.5 times of cost of production.

“But after winning the election, they have ended the MSP. As per media reports, only 6% of produce is taken by the government at the MSP. Farmers are demanding that 100% of produce should be purchased at the MSP and the price should be 1.5 times of cost of production and you did the opposite. You have left the farmers to die,” Mr. Kejriwal said attacking the BJP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-attacks-bjp-over-farm-bills-says-it-left-farmers-to-die/article32834599.ece
223,2020/10/12,A visa-less VR trip with QuaQua’s experiential dome,"If you are bored at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, hop into this planetarium-like dome to teleport to your next holiday

Instagram and Facebook can only go so far to satiate your ‘travel thirst’. If you happen to be in Terminal 3 near Gate 41 at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, for yet another quarantine-related trip, you can take a spontaneous journey by stepping into a lime green dome in the terminal which will instantly transport you to a place of your choice for a fraction of the cost.

This is the latest VR project (which does not require a head-set) of QuaQua, a Hyderabad-based end-to-end virtual travel platform focussed on providing people with 360-degree experiences so they are more clear on a holiday destination.

Sandesh Reddy, co-founder of four-year-old QuaQua, says the optics and timings for this three-year installation are apt, but the ideation has been since pre-coronavirus times. “We’ve actually been working on this since June of 2019 and we were ready to go live right before the lockdown. We were sorting out some last minute technical issues when the lockdown hit,” he recalls.

‘Not a VR company’ Mixed Reality, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are in nascent stages in India, says Sandesh. It took QuaQua a year and a half to get through their ideation stages and perfect their formula of offerings as a company. “We aren’t just a VR company otherwise we would fall into a whole different category,” he clarifies, “so, as an end-to-end travel platform with a focus on content, we have 2D videos and images and even 360-degree videos, which are all VR-ready. The tag of a VR platform means that if you don’t have a VR headset, you can’t come browse — but that’s not us!”

He continues, “We had been sitting on so much content, we wanted to monetise it and take it to the general public. What better place than Delhi airport which sees huge amounts of traffic, both local and international?” QuaQua realised that no airport in the world has a theatrical experience, so they came up with the first permanent installation of a dome in an airport in the world.

So how does it work? As per airport rules, sanitation, mask-wearing and physical distancing rules are strict. The 323 square-foot dome, which is sanitised hourly, can hold up to 16 people, but physical distancing measures allows a maximum of four people in, after a travel experience is chosen. What follows is a projection of five to seven minutes.

Experiences include a day/night walk-through of Venice, Italy, and of Luxor Temple, Egypt. So far, the feedback has been one of collective excitement. Sandesh explains, “The content, based on feedback, is refreshed every month and a half. We started with two titles on launch day and now we are close to 10. We have child-friendly animated content, as well as outer space or underwater titles for really immersive experiences.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cn5ucp/article32834319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12mp-quaqua,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hyderabad-company-quaqua-virtual-reality-travel-dome-at-delhi-airport/article32834320.ece
224,2020/10/12,Adarsh Nagar murder: Delhi Police allegedly damage SIM card of woman eyewitness,"North West DCP has refuted the allegations made by the woman and denied that policemen visited her and that they destroyed her SIM card

Delhi Police personnel allegedly damaged the mobile SIM card of the 21-year-old woman who has made allegations of police inaction in the October 7 murder of her friend Rahul Rajput in Adarsh Nagar area.

On Sunday, the woman made a video call from her mobile phone and made allegations of police inaction when she approached police personnel during the attack on Rahul by her brother and cousins.

Rahul and the woman are said to have known each other for three months. The woman’s brother was against their relationship as they belonged to different religions.

Rahul is said to have been beaten to death by the woman's brother and cousins in Adarsh Nagar area of north west Delhi.

The woman on Sunday afternoon made a call to police personnel related to the case and requested them to let her meet Rahul’s parents and said she would otherwise approach the media for help.

According to the woman, at 8 p.m., three persons, including a woman, in civilian clothes claiming to be police personnel reached the shelter home where she was staying.

“On the pretext of getting some information and details in the case, they took my phone. Two other policemen engaged me in some paperwork and the woman police somehow damaged my SIM card. When I found there was no network in my phone and confronted the police personnel, they left the shelter home,” said the woman on a video call to her friend.

She alleged that they asked her to write on a paper that she was getting full support from police. She followed their instructions in the hope that she would get help in the case.

Though they left the shelter home promising her a new SIM card, it was not provided to her. She then arranged to call her friend with the help of the warden.

Vijayanta Arya, DCP (North West), has denied the allegations made by the woman about the conduct of the police personnel. She denied on Monday that policemen visited her and that they destroyed her SIM card.

Aam Aadmi Party chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday said that if action was not taken by Monday evening against Delhi Police officials for allegedly not saving Rahul, then the party would stage a protest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wog4xm/article32833034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/adarshnagar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/adarsh-nagar-murder-delhi-police-allegedly-damage-sim-card-of-woman-eyewitness/article32832982.ece
225,2020/10/12,Adarsh Nagar murder: witness alleges police inaction,"Action will be taken if woman’s allegations are found to be true, says DCP

The 21-year-old woman, who is an eyewitness in the case of murder of her friend Rahul Rajput, has said that had the police acted on time, Rahul could have been saved.

The woman, over a video call from a shelter home, said that on October 7 evening, she was with Rahul when her brother called him to meet for a discussion on a tuition.

“The moment we reached, Rahul was attacked. I tried to save him, but could not. I rushed to a police post at Adarsh Nagar where the policemen were having tea. I requested them to come along and save my friend, but they said they could not do anything,” said the woman.

She also alleged that there were a total of eight persons who attacked Rahul, but the police have named only five. Even after reporting the matter to a police post, none arrived at the location to try to find out about the attack. Rahul had sustained injuries. He returned home, while the woman was brought home by her brother. Later, the SHO asked her to shift to a shelter home, claiming there could be a threat to her life.

Inconsolable, the woman said, had she known Rahul would be thrashed, she would have never let him meet his brother. “I will fight till his killers are hanged. I want justice for Rahul and fair investigation into the case,” she said.

Vijayanta Arya, DCP (North-West), said that if the woman’s allegations are found true, then action will be taken against the policemen concerned.

“Apart from the woman’s statement, we have technical evidence and eyewitnesses of the incident. We have obtained the CCTV footage from the area to get more clarity on the sequence of events,” said Ms. Arya.

236,2020/10/12,In hunger and health: how Delhi's Bangla Sahib Gurdwara is lending a helping hand,"Besides free food, Bangla Sahib Gurdwara is expanding its social service drive by providing essential tests at subsidised rates to the financially weak

On Wednesday afternoon, 36-year-old Deepak Kumar, a driver from Ghaziabad, was wandering outside a building next to the Bangla Sahib Gurdwara. He asked a person standing outside the door of the building: “Is this where CT scans are done?” He was told it is yet to start.

Many people have started coming to Guru Harkrishan Polyclinic Bangla Sahib after it was announced earlier this week that people from economically backward sections can get an MRI scan done for ₹50. The charge for X-ray will be ₹50 while dialysis will come at ₹600.

“Four machines for dialysis have already arrived and we will most probably start dialysis from next week. We have placed orders for X-ray and MRI machines, but they have not arrived. We plan to start the services by December,” said Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, which runs the clinic.

Eligibility assessment

A committee of doctors will decide whether a person is eligible for an MRI scan for ₹50 while others have to pay ₹800. Mr. Sirsa said they are also planning to buy a machine to do CT scan at cheaper rates for poor people, but they have not finalised it. All the machines are brought with donations, he said.

Mr. Kumar, who makes ₹13,000 a month, said he cannot afford getting tested from outside. “My head has been aching for the past 15-20 days. I went to see a doctor and got a little relief, but he asked me to get a CT scan done. I knew it is expensive outside and a friend of mine told me that I can get it done at Bangla Sahib for ₹50,” he said.

Virat Rana, 20, came with his friend to enquire about the tests. “My brother is a doctor, who works at a hospital and also runs a clinic in Krishna Nagar. He has asked me to enquire whether it has started, so that he can refer patients here.”

A board outside the clinic shows rates of different tests done there, starting from ₹20.

“Every patient has to do a registration of ₹10 and he will get his consultation and medicine for that money. If we feel that he is extremely poor or cannot afford a test, then we will do it for free. No one should go unhappy from the gurdwara,” a doctor at the hospital said.

Modernised machines

The doctor said that as the clinic is old they were adding the machines to modernise it. “Also, we have many senior consultants who come here once or twice a week without taking any money. They also suggested that we should have these machines as people will benefit. Then we did a survey in the area and found that these tests were really expensive and we should start them here as a charity,” the doctor said.

The clinic, which used to witness a footfall of around 250-300 patients a day, has been partially operational since the virus outbreak. Though the timing of the clinic is 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., the administration is planning to run the new tests for 12 hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Close to the clinic, there is a pharmacy where anyone can buy medicines at a cheaper rate. “I came here to buy my vitamin tablets. The rates here are about 60% cheaper than outside,” said R.P Pandey, 63, who was waiting outside the pharmacy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1vynk4/article32829573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BALAPRITAMDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lending-a-helping-hand/article32829576.ece
237,2020/10/12,HC grants bail to woman convicted of killing stepson,"Bench observes that she needs to look after her minor son

The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a woman, who was convicted of killing her stepson, as there is presently no one to look after her 7-year-old son.

A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Pajnish Bhatnagar, as a condition for the bail, ordered her to work ‘pro bono’ (without payment) with an NGO here for the welfare of the children in the area.

“If it is found that the appellant [woman] is not willing to perform the pro-bono work of ‘Pahal’ [NGO], it shall be open to the State to move an application for cancellation of the bail granted to the appellant,” the court said.

The woman was found guilty by a trial court here of murdering her minor stepson with whom she did not have a good relationship.

In her bail plea, she stated that her husband is a rickshaw puller and is, therefore, not able to look after the child as he has to labour throughout the day. She stated that there is no other member in the family, who could look after the minor child. The bail plea also stated that she does not have a criminal past and that her appeal against the conviction is pending.

The court was informed that she has undergone incarceration for over four years and two months and that her jail conduct is found to be satisfactory.

“While on the one hand, the appellant [woman] has been found to be guilty of serious and heinous crime of committing the murder of her own minor stepson, on the other hand, the son of the appellant — who is 7-years-old — is suffering without the company of his mother,” the Bench said.

“The family of the appellant is poor and the father of the child is working as a rickshaw puller and has to work throughout the day to make both ends meet,” it said, adding, “In the peculiar circumstances of the case, we are inclined to grant bail to the appellant during the pendency of the present appeal”.

The court directed the woman to provide her mobile phone number to the Investigating Officer – at the time of release, which shall be kept in working condition at all times. It also directed her not to switch-off or change the same without prior intimation to the IO, during the period of bail.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-grants-bail-to-woman-convicted-of-killing-stepson/article32829568.ece

239,2020/10/12,BSES worker held for sexual harassment,"A 32-year-old BSES employee was arrested for allegedly flashing his private part to a minor girl in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar, the police said on Sunday.

They said they received information at 4.30 p.m. on Saturday about the incident.

“The police then reached the spot following which the complainant said her six-year-old daughter was standing near door where one person from BSES committed the crime,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.

240,2020/10/12,Magistrate may not act as ‘post office’ for police custody pleas,"Case pertains to ATM theft of over ₹30L

Dismissing a revision petition against the denial of police custody of three accused in an ATM theft case, the court of an Additional Sessions Judge here has remarked that “judicial magistrate may not act as a post office” and “the court is always empowered and legally required also to check the genuineness of the request of the police custody”.

The matter pertains to alleged theft of ₹38.86 lakh from the ATM booth of a private bank at Caterpuri village on September 10 last year. An FIR was registered at Palam Vihar police station in this connection.

The police recorded the confessional statement of three accused — Raghunath, Sanjeev and Anil — on July 7 and on September 14. However, the Judicial Magistrate In-charge (Gurugram), Kopal, turned down the pleas of the investigation officer (IO) seeking their police custody on both occasions.

Hearing the revision petition against the September 14 order, Additional Sessions Judge Amit Sahrawat observed that the police were seeking the custody of the accused to recover the stolen cash more than a year after the crime. The court also pointed out that the police were seeking custody to demarcate the place of theft, but the site plan was already recorded in their file.

Saying that the two investigation officers in the case had made “clear and deliberate lapse” in making a fair and proper investigation, the judge, in his five-page order, pointed out that the statement of the bank manager and the agency responsible for replenishing the ATM machine were not recorded about the serial number of the notes allegedly stolen.

“Without such statement, any of the recoveries of the currency notes, even if made from the accused, may not be linked with the alleged theft,” the court observed.

The court also remarked that the investigating officers were habitual of recording the confessional statement of the accused at any time and subsequently to seek police custody on the basis of such confessional statement.

Upholding the order by the court of JMIC Komal, Mr. Sahrawat observed that “this court does not see any kind of illegality and irregularity in the order” and directed the Police Commissioner to take action against such “reckless” investigating officers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/magistrate-may-not-act-as-post-office-for-police-custody-pleas/article32829461.ece
241,2020/10/12,Supremacy is His Swabhava,"The Sarira-Sariri tenet is central and exclusive to the Visishtadvaita philosophy. It explains the relationship between the Lord and the entire creation. The Lord is the Sariri and the entire creation comprising the chetana and the achetana beings and objects is His Sarira. As long as the chetana and achetana beings exist, He supports them and keeps them under His control. They cannot exist independently and are bound to Him seamlessly.

In a discourse, Aasuri Sri Madhavachariar drew attention to the Phala Sruti verse in the Vishnu Sahasranama Stotra that captures the essence of this bhava. The heavens, the moon, the stars, and all the heavy objects in the entire creation are kept in their respective places and supported and made to function owing to His Sankalpa. In the individual chetana and achetana beings and objects, the body exists as along as the jivatma exists. It becomes lifeless when the atma exits. Just as a jivatma directs his body, mind, intellect, etc according to his will, the Lord is the sole master. All others in creation are His possessions and exist to serve Him as Sesha bhutas. Brahma, Rudra, Indra, etc, are subordinate to Him. There is none who can equal His supremacy nor is there anyone who is above Him. This supremacy is His natural swabhava. When in life there are masters with servants to work for them, these are roles that are obtained by circumstances and for limited periods of time. But the Lord is the Master at all times and for the entire creation. It means no one can be His master and He is not obliged to serve anyone. Still, out of His own Sankalpa, as in Rama and Krishna avatars, He willingly plays the role of a Seshi, when He serves Vishwamitra and fights Tataka, or when He drives the chariot for Arjuna, or goes as a messenger for the Pandavas.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/supremacy-is-his-swabhava/article32837451.ece
242,2020/10/12,Thanjavur Art Plates: A vintage mix of multiple skills,"The makers of the Thanjavur Art Plate, with its roots in a craft that dates back to the Marathas of the 1800s, are banding together for its cultural and commercial rejuvenation

At his home in Nanayakarar Chetty Street, Thanjavur, which doubles up as his workshop, M Paramasivam, 72, covers a brass kodam (water pot) with ornate etchings of floral motifs, using a tiny chisel.

Paramasivam, who started working at the age of 16, is one of a dwindling number of old-school artisans who specialise in what used to be known as ‘Thanjavur kalai’ (an umbrella term for an art that incorporates embossing, etching, engraving and filigree on metallic surfaces).

Thanjavur kalai requires the skills of a metalworker, jeweller and a designer of not just patterns, but also tools. That is why it is quite common to see four or more people work on each step of an artefact.

“I am the last in five generations of my family in Thanjavur kalai; I hope the glory days of our craft will come back in my lifetime,” says Paramasivam.

Vintage craft

Patronised by Maratha ruler Serfoji II (1777-1832),Thanjavur kalai craftsmen were kept busy with orders for royal gifts, mostly decorative salvers, jewel boxes and vessels like water pots and ewers. In its contemporary version, the craft has been commercially reinterpreted as ‘Thanjavur kalai thattu’ or Thanjavur Art Plate, a ceremonial platter made with silver, copper and brass layers in three stages: the base plate with alternate copper and silver panels, a bigger embossed silver motif on the central section, and the setting of globular jigna or sequins in the secondary relief.

Thanjavur Art Plate was given a Geographical Indications (GI) tag in 2007, as a proof of its long heritage.

Once prized as the pinnacle of artistry in Tamil Nadu, it was often presented to visiting dignitaries by the State Government. In 1980, for instance, an elaborately embellished Thanjavur Art Plate was gifted by the then-Governor Sadiq Ali to Britain’s Prince Charles during his visit to India.

With prices fixed according to size, Thanjavur Art Plates can fetch anywhere upwards of ₹4,000.

“Every Thanjavur kalai piece is unique, because the artisan will customise the design to suit the surface. It is a pity that it has become confined to a single product,” says N Paramasivam, president of the district-level Thanjavur Art Plate Artisans’ Welfare Association.

The recently-formed industry body has 200 members.

“We formed the welfare association mainly to protect the authenticity of our products,” says PGA Babu, the secretary. “While a genuine 10-inch Thanjavur Art Plate in the Government-run Poompuhar showroom costs ₹4,500, you can find something similar with fake metal adhesive strips for as less as ₹700 just a few shops down the road. Customers should respect the workmanship, and patronise only genuine outlets for buying our plates,” he says.

Designer ware

Watching the artisans work requires several trips to the home-based pattrais (workshops) in the Therku Veedhi area in Thanjavur, where plates travel from hand to hand in different stages of completion.

Traditional artisans tend to buy old brassware from shops because their thicker gauge allows them to work on intricate designs from scratch.

A hot paste of pungaliya tree resin and brick powder or red sand is poured into orifices of vessels which solidifies as it cools, allowing the artisan to work on the outer surface without denting the base. Once the design is finished, the solid paste is carefully removed from the interiors.

A similar waxy background fixes plates firmly to the work surface until the embellishment is over.

While religious motifs such as Ashtalakshmi (eight avatars of Goddess Lakshmi) and Dasavatharam (10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu), are commonly used on Thanjavur Art Plates, designs can be varied to include corporate logos and Nature themes.

Aided by lathes, iron tools and ground-level forges, the artisans also create lead dies for the motifs from scratch, transferring paper patterns to copper and silver foil by punching tiny dots through the diagram.

“Artisans of my father’s generation worked long hours to keep up with orders. There was a healthy competition among peers to see who would come up with the prettiest product,” says Babu.

Changing times

The cottage industry has been witnessing a slow decline despite its protected status. Once employing over 200 artisans and their families in Thanjavur, today there are only around 60 people still active in this art form.

Primed for the market The din of ringing metal announces the presence of the temporary workshop in the basement of the Poompuhar showroom on Gandhiji Road in Thanjavur. Ten Thanjavur kalai craftsmen are hard at work here on different stages of platters for a corporate function.

“The silver that we use in these plates is 99.9% pure, because foil work cannot be done alloyed metal,” says workshop supervisor S Palanivel. “We make plates from five inches to 24 inches in size here. Plates up to 16 inches sell well; bigger sizes are available on order. Every step is equally complicated. For example, a less experienced person can damage the foil work or the copper embossing if they don’t know how to fill it with hot wax,” says Palanivel as he shows us around the tiny workspace.

As the last step, acrylic domes are affixed on the plates to prevent the metals from getting tarnished.

Many artisans feel that the concentration on plates has left little scope for them to work on other items like vessels and devotional images that used to be valued both as artefacts and for religious worship.

“I used to participate in workshops held by handicraft emporia across India, and also send products to the bigger cities. But for the past 15 years, the market for other items bearing Thanjavur kalai embellishments has died out,” says artisan Paramasivam. “If art lovers and artisans both return to the heritage roots of the craft, it will definitely flourish again.”

Poompuhar, the State Government-run handicraft emporium, is the sole authorised source for genuine Thanjavur Art Plates, and so, saw a steady demand that kept sales as high as ₹6-10 lakh per month. The recent lockdown changed that.

“The orders have stopped because of the restrictions on public meetings, especially Government functions where our plates are usually given away as mementoes,” says K Arun, the showroom manager.

To encourage revival, the authorities are planning to open a dedicated unit to produce Thanjavur Art Plates. “The machines will be available in our common workshop, which can be used by artisans for a nominal charge,” says Arun. “We may be able to draw a younger crop of artisans to this craft if we use technology to ease some of the hard physical labour involved in plate production.”

To create a genuine Thanjavur Art Plate, artisans need to develop a high level of artistic skill that requires knowledge of mathematics, geometry and metallurgy, besides drawing.

Many of the older artisans achieved this despite never having attended school. “The young people in our community are getting educated these days, to find better-paying jobs. I hope education will inspire them to reinvigorate our profession,” says Babu.",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/qp9k8f/article32835230.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Poompuhar-plates,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/thanjavur-art-plates-artisans-look-to-revive-their-heritage-craft/article32835239.ece
243,2020/10/12,A house of history in Thoothukudi,"At 46, Thaika Street, in seaside Kayalpattinam in Thoothukudi district, stands an ancestral home that now drives change in the town by showcasing local talent and craft

Chennai in a Box, captures the essence of the city within a small bamboo frame, including bajji shops, the Lighthouse, Central Station and other heritage buildings.

The painting is by an Engineering student from Chennai, who returned home to Kayalpattinam, a seashore town in Thoothukudi district, during the lockdown. It is now on Instagram, @46Thaikastreet, an account run by Jariya Azeez in Kayalpattinam.

Jariya launched Abati (which means ‘My Father’ in Arabic), a store focussing on handmade products at her ancestral home, with the intention of giving back to her town. “Most of the women here (predominantly Muslim) remain homemakers, with no opportunity to exhibit their knowledge and talent,” says 29-year-old Jariya, an MBA.

“Although I am from Kayalpattinam, I was raised in Chennai and we visited only during vacations. When we decided to settle here a few years ago, I began to see this town from a different perspective,” she adds, explaining that she is currently focussing on tapping into the talents of women from her community and highlighting the rich cultural heritage of Kayalpattinam.

“The town is one of the oldest trading ports along the coast of Tamil Nadu. A strong Arab and Sri Lankan influence is seen in its cuisine and culture,” she explains.

Jariya motivated her sister Afeera Azeez, a home baker, to launch Abati Cakes and the venture was an instant hit. By then Jariya was familiar with Kayalpattinam, and had made some friends. “I began to spot talent in tailoring, embroidery, calligraphy, mehendi art, painting and so on. Then, I started giving them ideas and motivated the women, who would otherwise never openly exhibit their skills.”

For instance, she came across a handmade vattuvam, an ethnic sling bag made of cloth, which women traditionally used to carry money. On learning that 80-year-old Ayesha kamma (grandmother) was adept at making vattuvams in all sizes, she collaborated with her to create a range using recycled cloth.

Jariya says, “She was thrilled by the attention she got and her family also encouraged her. They are completely handmade, with double lining and compartments. Many young girls learn from her and today we design vattuvams in silk and other material as well,” says Jariya adding that they also embroider the bags.

Abati also sells terracotta artefacts, clothes, palm leaf and wooden show pieces. Jariya focusses on upcycling and recycling. She says the products are valuable as material is sourced locally, designed by local artists and hand-crafted.

For calligraphy, she developed and designed mementos using terracotta plates sourced from a village nearby. “We have an artist who creates wonders with these plates and in combination with artistic calligraphy, these are constantly in demand,” she says.

Jariya has restored to glory her ancestral home, which has unique architecture and design, with separate entrances for men and women. She also offers consultation for restoration projects.

During the lockdown, a lending library was launched as one of the women in the community had a good collection of books. Within a few weeks, two more have joined and come forward to lend their books. Information on books available is circulated

Jariya is keen on reviving some of the old Kitabs (textbooks) written in Arabu Tamil. This language, a fusion of Arabic and Tamil was spoken locally many years ago, and had a script and a number of books were written in it as well. Today very few can read Arabu Tamil, and sadly, only very few copies of the books are available.

As palm trees are in abundance in the region, palm leaf baskets are part of the culture — Jariya has put up a range of these eco-friendly products as well.

Slowly the boutique began to grow within her home. She says, “I put my heart and soul into bringing out the local art of Kayalpattinam, and gradually, I set up a shop in a portion in my house.”

Soon, her house, initially known only for Abati Cakes, became a hub for arts and crafts and she started promoting them on social media. “As many who hail from this town live overseas, they connected with this project and youngsters who live in neighbouring towns started showing interest,” she says,

The address of the craft shop, 46 Thaika Street, is Jariya’s social media handle. “There is heritage in every street here, with centuries-old dargahs, fascinating local history and amazing traditional food,” says Jariya. Though the pandemic is a challenge now, she has plans for when life returns to normal. “I hope to conduct a heritage walk in Kayalpatnam in the future.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/w9htgi/article32834792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MP17Chennaiboxabati,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/abati-brings-together-the-local-talent-to-develop-eco-friendly-upscaled-and-ethical-craft-products/article32834801.ece
244,2020/10/12,"Testing, tracing should go hand in hand, says Dr. G.V.S. Murthy","PHFI’s IIPH-Hyderabad Director Dr. G.V.S. Murthy reiterated testing and tracing for COVID-19 should go “hand in hand”. There was an initial thrust on contact-tracing protocols but the surge of positive cases simply overwhelmed the health systems — already strained due to shortage of personnel, and the effective tracing has therefore faltered. “This could have been avoided if the governments concerned had called upon other staff and community leadership, trained them and equipped them for contact tracing. Unfortunately, this has not happened and only testing was ramped up and tracing given a short shrift,” he points out.

Digital applications were launched with a lot of fanfare and had tremendous potential for tracing, but this potential was hardly harnessed. A review of 94 studies showed the overall estimate of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and asymptomatic was 20%. It means majority of infected show some symptoms of COVID-19 which may remain unrecognised or are hidden due to stigma, he explains.

The more such people are tested, the higher will be the test positivity. So there will be a direct relationship between testing and case positivity. To increase the yield of cases through effective tracing will reduce the transmission and that is why testing and tracing should go hand-in-hand, he maintained.

245,2020/10/12,Congress wants OBC voters’ survey before GHMC polls,"‘Social justice can be ensured only with enumeration for finalising BC reservations’

The Congress party has requested Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to conduct OBC voters survey and categorisation of Backward Classes ahead of the forthcoming elections to several municipal corporations in the State, including GHMC.

In a detailed letter addressed to the Chief Minister on Monday, national spokesperson of All India Congress Committee (AICC) Dasoju Sravan said social justice to BC communities was possible only with their enumeration for finalising BC reservations scientifically.

Stating that BCs Cooperative Finance Corporation could conduct the survey in accordance with the 2018 Act ,Mr. Sravan felt that social justice to all communities of BCs could be ensured only if they were categorised into A, B, C, D and E groups and provided at least 33% reservation in the local bodies, which had been in practice in the State since 1993.

The Congress leader also asked the Chief Minister to take appropriate legal measures to ensure that BCs get their due/proportionate share. He also wanted the State government to keep the proposed amendments to the GHMC Act in the public domain and seek people’s opinion before the changes were introduced in the State Legislature and passed.

Highlighting the fact that Telangana was a unique State in the country where almost 90% of the population belongs to BC, SC, ST and minority communities, Mr. Sravan, quoting the “Samagra Kutumba Survey (SKS)” taken up by the State government in 2014, said the OBC population constituted nearly 52%.

He stated that BCs had fought for Telangana and had even sacrificed their lives with a fundamental belief that there would be complete social justice with the formation of Telangana as envisaged by B.R. Ambedkar, which was being promised by Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao time and again. However, BCs were being denied their constitutional rights as they were deliberately being deprived of their due share in the socio-economic resources and political opportunities, Mr Sravan added.

Despite repeated appeals to the Chief Minister and even directions of the High Court, the government had failed to conduct a comprehensive survey of BCs and denied due political justice to all sections of BCs in the Panchayat Raj elections held in 2019, Mr. Sravan alleged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/congress-wants-obc-voters-survey-before-ghmc-polls/article32837992.ece

Incessant rains during September and October have seen one-half of the twin reservoirs receive inflows almost up to the full tank level (FTL), bringing cheer to heritage lovers and activists fighting to save the two water bodies.

Himayatsagar reservoir may reach the full tank level for the first time since 2010, given that heavy rain warning has been issued for the coming two days, say officials from the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board.

Reserves in Himayatsagar tank are inching towards the FTL, and once it is reached, officials sounding warnings on Monday said the reservoir gates would be opened to let the flood water into the Musi River, which could result in inundation of areas bordering the river.

As per information last received, water level in the reservoir was hovering at 1,762 feet, a little short of the FTL of 1,763.5 feet. Against the full capacity of 2.97 tmcft, the tank is holding 2.603 tmcft of water.

A massive portion of the Majnu Burj inside the Golconda Fort collapsed on Saturday afternoon due to rain.

Images which were shared on social media platforms on Monday and went viral showed the collapsed bastion of the 500-year-old fort with a portion of a cannon still perched precariously on the edge. The Majnu Burj is inside the Naya Qila area of the Golconda Fort, which is under the control of Hyderabad Golf Club (HGC).

Saturday’s incident

“The bastion is on the right side as we go towards the African Boabab tree in the Naya Qila area. It happened on Saturday, but somehow the word leaked out today (Monday),” said a HGC member.

Images showed wedge marks on the large rocks revealing the role of human intervention in the collapse of the bastion.

The Majnu Burj overlooks the Shahhatim Talab on one side and the manicured lawns of the golf club on the other. While the Golconda Fort is under the control of Archaeological Survey of India, the golf club developed inside the area is under HGC under a MoU signed in 2009.

Cyberabad police arrested three members of a Nepali gang involved in a string of dacoities in the city, on Monday. A sum of ₹5.2 lakh and 300 grams of old jewellery were recovered from their possession.

The accused, Netra Bahadur Shahi (40), Prakash Shahi (39) and Sita Lawar (25), who hail from different parts of Nepal, worked as domestic help in different houses at Raidurgam. “They sedated the inmates of the house of one Sailaja Reddy and looted valuables,” Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar said.

He said the case was investigated with the help of the personnel of a Central para-military force ‘Sashastra Seema Bal’ along with police from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. According to him, seven more accused involved in the case are still at large.

Mr. Sajjanar said on the intervening night of October 5 and 6, the accused mixed sleeping pills in the food and tea served to the house inmates and other workers. “Once they were all knocked out, Janki and Manoj, two others of the gang who are absconding passed on information to Netra, who in turn sent two people inside the house to execute the dacoity,” said Mr Sajjanar.

They beat up and blindfolded Sailaja Reddy, who was still conscious as she did not drink the tea, and threatened to kill her as well as her infant grandson Ayansh if she raised an alarm. “The gang looted gold, silver and other valuables, and decamped with the booty,” Mr. Sajjanar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/1hg3by/article32837898.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy12Nepali,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/three-of-nepali-dacoity-gang-in-police-net-two-absconding/article32837891.ece
251,2020/10/12,Two Karvy employees held for cheating investors,"They traded couple’s demat account without consent, caused ₹1 crore loss

Two employees of a financial services company were arrested by Hyderabad police on Monday on charges of cheating and misappropriation of stock holding of investors without authorisation.

The accused are G. Mounika (25), branch manager, and Shivini Gari Shetty Vasundhara (41), assistant branch manager of Karvy Stock Broking, Tarnaka branch.

Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said Mounika and Vasundhara took the signatures of Ramarao Nagaraj, an overseas citizen of India, and his wife on blank papers, when they visited the branch office for activation of their demat accounts in February 2018. The accused traded the demat account of the couple, between May 2018 to February 2019, without their consent and caused a loss of ₹1 crore by repeatedly trading nearly ₹100 crore for brokerage sharing between 60% and 40% between the Karvy stock broking office and Karvy main office. “They violated the rules of SEBI and NSE without taking any purchase order from the complainant and his wife,” Mr. Mohanty added.

On September 25, Mr Nagaraj approached Central Crime Station to lodge a complaint, stating that he and his wife had stock equivalent to ₹1 crore in their demat account at Karvy Stock Broking, Tarnaka.

253,2020/10/12,HC cautions govt. about possible second wave,"COVID-19 death statistics furnished by the Public Health department not trustworthy, says court

Expressing dissatisfaction over report on COVID-19 status presented by Public Health director in-charge Srinivasa Rao, Telangana High Court issued a slew of directions to the government on Monday.

While cautioning the government about the reports of possible second wave of coronavirus, the HC said the statistics about the deaths due to COVID-19 furnished by the Public Health department were not trustworthy. A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, hearing 25 PIL petitions relating to COVID-19, said the voluminous 520-page report presented by the government “was vague”.

Government figures indicated that 1,219; 1,378 and 1,417 COVID-19 positive cases were reported in the State on September 20, 27 and 30 respectively. Deaths reported on these days were 9,7 and 13 respectively. Average number of deaths in October month was being shown as 10. The bench wondered if the government directed Lord Yamaraja not to take away more than 10 lives due to coronavirus each day.

The bench wanted the government to collect details of number of tests conducted, positive cases and deaths in the States of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi from July 1 to October. Same data for Telangana State should be gathered. A comparative analysis with graphs of the data must be presented before the court by November 16, the bench said.

The bench, expressing dissatisfaction over the government failing to comply with the directions given by the court on COVID-19, said it would be compelled to summon the Chief Secretary for appearance if the same situation continues. The CS was instructed to appear earlier in these PIL pleas since authorities did not adhere to the instructions passed by the court, the bench said.

The bench made it clear to the government that the latter should increase the availability of hospital beds as the State has only 1.3 beds for 1,000 population as against WHO norms of three beds for 1,000 people. Earlier, the government gave an undertaking to establish live dash boards at hospitals indicating number of beds available and other details.

The bench said the government should install such boards at least at Gandhi hospital and Government Chest hospital and eventually at all other COVID-19 designated hospitals. The PIL pleas were posted to November 19 for next hearing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ttza2s/article32837543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy12Guidlinescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hc-cautions-govt-about-possible-second-wave/article32837544.ece
254,2020/10/12,"‘COVID-19 needs national-level clinical, management guidelines’","Make it clear all that medication should be only under doctors’ supervision as irrational consumption of drugs can cause irreversible harm, warn health experts

There is an urgent need to establish clinical and management guidelines at the national level so that more efficacious and less harmful medicines are used for COVID-19 treatment. Guidelines should explicitly mention at what stage of the infection a specific drug should be given and it should be made clear all that medications should be ‘ONLY’ under medical supervision, say public health experts.

None of the currently used medicines should be bought over the counter and consumed as they can cause irreversible harm to the person. “Gains of evidence-based medicine are being compromised by irrational use of drugs for COVID-19 under the pretext that something ‘has to be done’ – This is a dangerous argument as it is pushing many drugs licensed for other purposes into the COVID management cauldron without adequate rigorous trials,” warns Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI)’s Indian Institute of Public Health-Hyderabad Director Dr. G.V.S. Murthy.

This includes use of many anti-cancer, anti-protozoal, anti-biotic and anti-viral medications with no clinical trials to prove efficacy and safety of medications. Many of these may be no better than a placebo. Large clinical trials of more than 1,000 patients are going on with drugs like Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ Ritonavir, Tocilizumab or convalescent plasma used alone. Big trials with combination drugs like hydroxychloroquine + famotidine/lopinavir/azithromycin/ favipiravir, Remdesivir + Interferron, Favipiravar etc., plus stem cell therapy and colchicine are also being trialled, he says.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) ‘living guideline’ gives a strong recommendation for systemic steroids like dexamethasone for patients with severe and critical COVID-19 though not for non-severe COVID-19, based on eight randomised controlled trials (more than 7,000 patients). Corticosteroids are cheap, readily available and included in the WHO’s list of essential medicines.

“WHO says systemic steroids may reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. The ‘Recovery’ trial using Dexamethasone showed it decreased 28-day mortality in patients requiring oxygen or invasive ventilation,” explained Dr. Murthy.

COVID-19 deaths can also be reduced if accessible ventilation facilities supported by good maintenance care are provided for patients with moderate to severe symptoms. Since only 15 to 20% of such patients need these facilities, proper mapping and improved access to them should be ensured. For those with mild COVID-19, adequate hydration, fever management, improved nutrition and stress-free rest will go a long way to improve outcomes, he explains.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/gxksi9/article32837387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13CORONATEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/covid-19-needs-national-level-clinical-management-guidelines/article32837388.ece
255,2020/10/12,"Rain continues, forecast for two more days of showers","Another house collapses in Hyderabad due to incessant rains

Incessant rain continued its onslaught in the city on Monday too, with the Meteorology department predicting two more days of heavy to very heavy rains in several districts across Telangana.

With no respite in the climate from Sunday, roads and low lying areas in several localities have been flooded, and water entered homes and apartment cellars, giving nightmarish experience to the residents.

Traffic came to a stand still on many stretches due to flooding and overflowing nalas. Near Chaderghat railway bridge, the overflowing drain left the road flooded, causing untold misery to commuters.

In view of two building collapse incidents during the last two days resulting in three deaths, Minister K.T.Rama Rao has issued express instructions to the GHMC officials to issue notices for vacation of the dilapidated buildings. He asked the officials of the town planning wing to be on high alert in view of the continuous rains.

GHMC Commissioner D.S.Lokesh Kumar has through a press statement, alerted about the possibility of very heavy rains in the coming days as per the estimates of the Met department.

In a few locations, the rainfall could be as high as nine to 16 centimetres, he said, and issued instructions to the zonal and deputy commissioners to keep the monsoon emergency teams on alert and available, and identify relief centres such as schools, community halls, and other facilities and keep them ready.

Through a separate note, Mr. Lokesh Kumar issued instructions for paying special attention to the old compound walls and retaining walls of cellars adjoining open lands. Residents of the structures adjoining the old and retaining walls should be advised to vacate immediately.

While excavation of new cellars is not allowed, in case of the already dug cellars and work in progress, safety of the surrounding structures should be checked, and all standard safety precautions such as soil strengthening, retaining walls, barricading should be observed.

As per the information available up to 8 p.m., Kapra area received the maximum rainfall at six cm, followed by Hafeezpet at 5.6 cm. L.B.Nagar, Lingampally, Trimulgherry, KPHB, Cherlapally, Chandangar, Begumpet, Kondapur, West Marredpally, Peerzadiguda, Malkajgiri, A.S.Rao Nagar, Mallapur, Cantonment, Habsiguda, Moulali, Pashamylaram, Kushaiguda, Allwyn Colony, Ramnagar, Ramanthapur, and other areas received heavy rainfall.

GHMC has received 211 complaints about drainage overflow, and 29 about water logging. At 10 locations, trees and tree branches fell obstructing traffic.

Hyderabad Meteorological Centre has sounded weather warning for Telangana for the coming two days, with forecast of thunderstorm accompanied with lightning at isolated places, heavy to very heavy rain at a few places and extremely heavy rain at isolated places.

Depression in the West Central Bay of Bengal is expected to intensify further into ‘Deep Depression’ during the coming 12 hours, and move West-Northwest wards and cross the Northern coast of Andhra Pradesh between Narsapur and Visakhapatnam close to Kakinada during the early hours of October 13.

256,2020/10/12,Football coach Antony no more,"‘The biggest loss will be for the young talent of Cantonment belt’

It was a bleak Sunday for the football fraternity of the twin cities with Telangana Football Association (TFA) vice-president S. Antony passing away after prolonged illness. He was 69 and is survived by his wife, two sons and three daughters.

Popularly known as Tony, the Trimulgherry resident was counted among one of the most dedicated coaches and promoters of the sport. Through the Shastri Soccer Club and financial support by Prem of Sachdev Sports, he organised tournaments right through the phase when the State football association was dormant for close to two decades since ‘90s.

Tony spent time, energy and money, often from his own pocket, to scout talent in the vicinity of Trimulgherry in a selfless manner despite being denied a position on the then Andhra Pradesh Football Association executive committee, which according to former international P.P. Surender Kumar alias Gopi was simple proof, if needed, of this gentleman’s commitment and passion for the sport.

For five decades, he was regularly hosting a minimum of five tournaments and coaching camps every year for different age groups and consistently ensured that there was an inter-school tournament. A former State player himself, he knew what the young talent needed and was also a successful coach at St. Andrews School. “The sport will be poorer without Tony and the biggest loss will be for the young talent of Cantonment belt for they will miss the caring touch of this wonderful human being who produced about 60 national players,” Gopi said.

Former India football captain Victor Amalraj, TFA president Mohd. Ali Rafat, secretary G. Palguna, former internationals Aleem Khan, SBH coach E.

Two cadets of Telangana Social Welfare Residential Sainik School at Rukmapur in Karimnagar cracked NDA & NA Examination-II to be eligible to join the National Defence Academy in officer cadre.

With this feat, the institution has made a beginning with the very first batch of cadets to fulfil its purpose of establishment, within just two years, said TSWREIS secretary R.S. Praveen Kumar congratulating the cadets Mallesh Yadav and Pratheek Kumar, the Rukmapur Sainik School team and their mentors.

Mr. Kumar also pointed out that the main Sainik Schools of Ministry of Defence do not provide adequate representation to the students belonging to the marginalised sections of society.

Sainik School upgrade

Hence, a Sainik School exclusively dedicated to the students of these sections was started, with one social welfare school at Rukmapur converted into Sainik School with the approval of Telangana government on par with Sainik Schools of Ministry of Defence, to train the cadets academically, physically and mentally to join the officer cadre of Indian Armed Forces.

The school commenced in 2018-19 with a retired Army officer, Colonel Ravindra Reddy as its director. The Secretary termed the achievement as vindication of his belief that a separate State Sainik School would do wonders.

Operations at the Thoppumpady fisheries harbour were partially disrupted following a dispute among fishers over the arrival of a couple of boats manned by fishers from Tamil Nadu.

Purse seine boat workers had objected to the arrival of gillnet boats on Saturday at the harbour with their catch. Harbour workers said the boats had arrived at Thoppumpady with fishers from Thengapattanam in Tamil Nadu.

A Fisheries Department official said fishers from other States were not allowed to operate out of fishing harbours in Kerala as part of measures taken to contain COVID-19. However, there is a difference of opinion among the community of fishers regarding the rule, which has divided them.

While one group said fishers from the neighbouring State may be allowed to operate out of Thoppumpady, the other maintained that rules should be stringently implement. An online meeting of stakeholders on Sunday in the presence of District Collector S. Suhas failed to arrive at a consensus.

The Thoppumpady harbour, Kerala’s biggest such facility, had remained closed for most part of the lockdown after the 52-day trawling ban that ended in the second week of August.

Activities at the harbour have been restricted for a long time, and workers are in a poor state, said M. Majeed, general secretary of the Harbour Coordination Committee. He added that besides hundreds of trawl boat workers from Tamil Nadu, there were around 5,000 people who depended on the harbour directly for livelihood.

The debris of concrete that is being dismantled from the Palarivattom flyover is being transported to overbridge construction sites in the city suburbs, to fill the space within the retention walls of their approaches.

Altogether six girders, which together constitute a span, have been cut using diamond cutters and dismantled, as part of reconstructing the structure. Adjacent girders will be dismantled next, to create space for workmen to begin pulling down the pier caps, official sources said.

The concrete deck, girders, and pier caps, which are dismantled mainly at night, will be crushed beneath the flyover and taken to overbridge construction sites, to be used for filling up space on the approaches. The demolition work has been going on as scheduled, ever since it began on October 1. Extra effort is made to carry out work during the day, if rain hampers work at night. The focus on night-time dismantling has helped cause least disturbance to traffic at the congested junction, the sources added.

The Kalady police arrested five persons, including two minors, on the charge of stealing five new-generation mobikes. They arrested are Vijay, 20, Binto, 25, and Sabin, 22. They were arrested on Saturday evening from Sree Sankara University Road during routine vehicle checking. They attempted to escape when the police signalled them to stop, after abandoning the mobikes, which did not have number plates. The police chased them down. One of the minors was employed as a mechanic at a workshop and knew how to make away with locked mobikes. The stolen vehicles were being sold in Palakkad. More arrests will be made in the coming days, the police said

269,2020/10/12,Where life is hemmed in by absence of public transport,"For Puthenvelikkara residents, daily commute a costly affair

Sheeba Yesudas, a single mother of two teenagers, has no clue how to plug the drain on her already meagre income, thanks to the near complete absence of public transport in the wake of the pandemic in her Puthenvelikkara grama panchayat near North Paravur.

A salesgirl in a textile shop, she is now forced to spend ₹70 every day as autorickshaw fare for conveyance as the public transport remains yet to be restored to the pre-pandemic days.

“At a time when we are already struggling to make ends meet, this is an additional burden we could have done without. During normal times, I could have hitch-hiked my way back and forth. But due to the scare of COVID, people no longer entertain that,” said Sheeba who is the sole breadwinner of the family. That even autorickshaws are operating in limited numbers make life even harder for the working class who cannot afford the luxury of two-wheelers.

Except for a sole private bus, the public transport network in this hamlet bordering Thrissur district is completely absent. KSRTC, which used to operate multiple services through the panchayat from nearby towns like Aluva and Paravur, is missing since the lockdown in March.

“I have personally spoken to the KSRTC authorities to restore at least a limited number of services during the morning and evening office hours since majority of the people work outside the panchayat. They had promised to do the needful in a week. That was a fortnight ago,” said P.V. Laju, president, Puthenvelikkara panchayat.

With no scope to pressurise private operators to resume service unless guaranteed of a stable collection, the civic body has been left with no other option but to knock on the door of KSRTC yet again.

It emerges that Sheeba is among the relatively lucky lot considering she has to pay only ₹70 for her daily trip from her home in Thuruthyppuram to the shop at Puthenvelikkara and back.

“That fare could touch ₹220 for back and forth trips between Thuruthyppuram and Paravur and ₹150 from Puthenvelikkara to Paravur. That could be too much for casual labourers working in those places,” said Francis Valiyaparambil, a former district panchayat member.

With the pandemic situation continuing, the restoration of public transport any time soon seems unlikely, leaving people in the panchayat with little options.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/where-life-is-hemmed-in-by-absence-of-public-transport/article32829824.ece
270,2020/10/12,Many tourism MSMEs yet to hop aboard the digital bandwagon,"Small ventures are the worst hit by the pandemic

Faced with the prospect of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Kerala’s tourism sector losing their market share to mega players, stakeholders have highlighted the urgent need for players in the sector to join the mainstream digital bandwagon, in order to remain afloat and make their presence felt.

MSMEs in the sector, which together provide employment to 80% of the approximately 15 lakh workforce, are the worst hit by the pandemic and the subsequent lull in the arrival of guests. The president of city-based Tourism Professionals Club (TPC), George Scaria, who is also a guest lecturer teaching responsible tourism at a university in Austria, said almost half the MSME players were unaware of digital technologies.

Mr. Scaria, who began his tourism career 30 years ago, is learning content marketing strategy online from the University of California. He, however, added that technology had its limitations and human intervention still played a major role in ensuring that tourists had a memorable trip. All that should not prevent MSME stakeholders from dropping their suspicion of each other and coming together on digital platforms for the common good. “Especially since the MSME Ministry is proactive and helpful,” he said, pointing to an instance of a bank denying loan to his tour agency that caters mainly to foreign tourists. “I shot off a complaint to the regional officer, who took it up with the bank concerned. A loan-approval letter from the bank followed,” he said.

India Tourism, in association with the MSME Ministry, recently apprised stakeholders in the sector of the numerous schemes that they could avail, in order to help those struggling in the wake of the pandemic.

Help desk

Recently, Web CRS Travel Technologies, a Kochi-based Startup India-accredited company, launched a free help desk to support MSMEs in the tourism sector. The aim is to provide necessary professional assistance to MSMEs that are preparing to reopen after the lockdown. Experts from various fields will clarify doubts of tourism entrepreneurs, while also assisting in technology elements needed to revitalize the tourism industry. Questions and concerns of entrepreneurs working in hospitality, tour and travel companies and tourism experience providers would be answered directly, or after consultation with experts, said Neelkanth Pararat, the founder of the firm.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/many-tourism-msmes-yet-to-hop-aboard-the-digital-bandwagon/article32829819.ece
271,2020/10/12,Uncertainty plagues second phase of Vyttila Mobility Hub in Kochi,"VMH Society without a full-time director; KMRL sources say decision on sourcing funds awaited

Uncertainty looms large over the ₹572-crore second phase development works of Vyttila Mobility Hub (VMH), which was envisaged as an inter-modal public transport hub to host buses, autorickshaws, metro rail and ferries.

Just a small part of the 26-acre premises that was taken over from the Agriculture Department is being used now, as space to berth KSRTC and private buses. Footfall at the metro station on the premises too is not as high as was expected. Even worse, the approach road to the hub is narrow and ill-lit, while footpaths are in dilapidated condition, turning away commuters from the premises.

The VMH Society is without a full-time managing director after R. Girija was shifted from the post a few months ago. It could hamper decision-making in matters such as the awarding of tenders for second phase works. The further development of the hub was not on the State government’s immediate priority list, probably because of fund crunch following the unprecedented floods of 2018 and 2019 and the COVID-19 situation, said official sources.

The VMH Society stakeholders were not on the same page on the government proposal earlier this year to grant land on the premises for setting up a CNG refilling outlet. It was because the prime land at Vyttila was handed over to the VMH Society on condition that it would only be used for transportation activity.

The State government had in 2019 accorded administrative sanction for second-phase works at the hub on a public-private partnership basis. Kochi Metro Rail Limited had readied a detailed project report (DPR) for this in 2018. Apart from augmenting facilities for bus, ferry and metro commuters, commercial space was to be earmarked for kiosks, supermarkets, hotels, dormitories and a paid AC lounge, in the second phase works.

Sources in KMRL said the work had not made any headway. “We were vested with the task of preparing the DPR and executing the project. A decision on sourcing funds and allied matters is awaited,” they said.

Meanwhile, work is under way at one end of the hub for building a terminal for the metro agency’s Water Metro project. The Water Metro’s control centre too is slated to be built at the hub.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/uncertainty-plagues-second-phase-of-vyttila-mobility-hub-in-kochi/article32829804.ece
272,2020/10/12,Tourism sector upbeat about resuming services,"Kerala Tourism deputy directors, DTPC secretaries to ensure adherence to COVID-19 protocol

Tourism and related stakeholders in central Kerala have wholeheartedly welcomed the State government’s decision to reopen tourism locales in a phased manner from Monday, especially since guests from north India are expected to turn up in good numbers during the Pooja holidays.

Operators of homestays and houseboats were particularly delighted at the decision permitting resumption of tourism activities from the day, while others are willing to wait a fortnight more, till November 1, when beaches will be opened to tourists.

The government has entrusted deputy directors of Kerala Tourism in each district and District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) secretaries with ensuring that all stakeholders, including guests, adhere to the COVID-19 protocol. “The government’s decision to reopen the sector has come at the right time, since small and medium players in the sector were severely hit by the pandemic-induced stalemate. On their part, tourism entrepreneurs must ready their infrastructure and manpower to receive guests,” said S. Vijayakumar, Secretary of Ernakulam DTPC.

Backwater cruise

The permission to operate backwater cruises will help tourist boat operators, especially at Marine Drive here. They are permitted to carry guests numbering half the seating capacity of each boat. All boats must be disinfected and frequently sanitised. The DTPC’s tour packages too will resume in tandem with the tourism relaxations. Bookings can be made online or at the tourism counter at Durbar Hall Ground. Tour desks would shortly be opened at Kochi metro’s Aluva, Edappally and Ernakulam Junction stations, he added.

The operators of 1,200 houseboats, of which around 800 have licence issued by the Ports Department, are eagerly awaiting the resumption of operations. “A bulk of houseboats operate in Alappuzha, followed by around 200 in Kumarakom. We have communicated to all industry stakeholders to strictly adhere to COVID-19 protocol, especially in ensuring hygiene of vessels and landing points. The health of guests and also of the local community with whom the houseboat sector is closely linked, will be accorded priority. Common check-in spots have been planned to enable proper screening of guests,” said Jobin G. Akkarakalam, vice president of Kerala Houseboat Owners Federation.

He welcomed the government’s decision to extend loan at discounted interest and grant-in-aid in the ₹80,000 to ₹1.20 lakh range to houseboats, depending on the number of rooms each vessel has. A vessel would require approximately ₹5 lakh to restore its engine, batteries and other components and to clean and fumigate them, as they had been idling since March, said Mr. Akkarakalam.

At Thattekkad

The Thattekkad Wildlife Sanctuary in Kochi’s suburbs is among the spots that nature enthusiasts have been waiting to visit. “The reopening of tourism sector has come at the right time, since migratory birds, especially from the Himalayas, generally arrive in Thattekkad from October 20 each year. Most people visit the locale for birdwatching and trekking and stay put for three days,” said Girish Chandran, a naturalist.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/9bq5zo/article32829775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-TOURISM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/tourism-sector-upbeat-about-resuming-services/article32829776.ece
273,2020/10/12,No system in place to monitor those cured of COVID-19,"Patients have been reaching out to doctors personally, complaining about breathlessness on exertion, persistent fatigue and giddiness

While the district has so far recorded over 14,800 recoveries from COVID-19, no system is in place yet to monitor people who have recovered, for symptoms or problems that might persist even weeks after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2.

According to A. Fathahudeen, pulmonologist and nodal officer for COVID-19 treatment at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery, such a system to monitor and study people who had recovered could be the need of the hour. “There are several critically ill patients who have been discharged. We need to see what happened to the shadows on their X-rays, if they still persist and how many of them are still symptomatic. Then, we could plan more tests like a lung function test and see what their oxygen saturation levels are,” he said.

But since the hospital is a COVID-19 facility, he anticipates that patients, once discharged, might be hesitant to return for more tests. “A decision will be taken this week on how we can approach them. Assessing symptoms over phone might be an option,” he said. Patients have been reaching out to doctors personally, complaining about breathlessness on exertion, persistent fatigue and giddiness.

While the Health Department in the district did not have a systematic method yet of monitoring patients with persistent symptoms even after testing negative, the telemedicine unit had been asked to keep track of such patients reaching out for help, said Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission.

A 53-year-old resident of Aluva, who was admitted in July to the ICU at the Government Medical College Hospital with pneumonia after testing positive for the disease, said that she continued to get breathless on walking some distance or speaking continuously for a while. Undisturbed sleep had eluded her for weeks after her discharge, leaving her irritable and angry, she added. She said she sought the help of a health professional for a prescription of anti-depressants that did not help.

Observing that patients, some of whom had been treated for COVID-19 in other States or even abroad, were approaching the hospital with breathing difficulties or cough even two months after their treatment, Aster Medcity set up a post-COVID clinic recently, said Praveen Valsalan, pulmonologist. “Breathlessness is common. People also come with residual cardiac problems or neurological problems, besides post-traumatic stress,” he said. A lung function test is done to determine the reason for persistent problems. Medication was sometimes suggested for persistent cough and people with post-traumatic issues were referred to a psychiatrist at the clinic, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/no-system-in-place-to-monitor-those-cured-of-covid-19/article32829727.ece
274,2020/10/12,This week in fashion,"A round-up of what’s been happening in India and around the world, from The Hindu Weekend desk

A whole new Loubi World

Luxury brands are getting more inventive about promoting their new collections in a post-pandemic world. Case in point, French shoe designer Christian Louboutin, who has created a virtual universe on South Korean gaming platform, Zepeto. The app allows users to create avatars and, for a limited period, try on the Spring-Summer 2021 collections showcased virtually at the recently-concluded Paris Fashion Week.

Your avatars can visit a digital version of the new Paris boutique on Rue St Honoré, take a selfie with the designer, and explore a techno version of the city, called Loubi World. Hit up the Eiffel Tower or the famous nightspot, Le Palace, where French DJ Zimmer spins tracks and pop star King Princess performs. With the immersive gaming industry booming (set to be worth $256.97 billion by 2025), this might be the way forward for brands to turn social media outreach into sales.

The Swiss watch brand, known for its fun designs and affordable price range, has come up with yet another innovation for their 1983 collection: a bio-reloaded version of their signature Sistem51 line. With only 51 moving parts anchored to a single central screw, this fully automatic design comes with a 90-hour power reserve. The 41mm case is made of a sustainable material extracted from the seeds of the castor plant.

The Omega Snoopy Speedmaster

Eye on the stars

Omega’s new silver Snoopy Speedmaster is an homage. Fifty years ago, NASA honored the Swiss luxury watch brand with the comic strip beagle-adorned lapel pin, the Silver Snoopy, after a Speedmaster was used on the Apollo 13 spacecraft to time a critical engine burn. It ensured the astronauts got safely back to Earth. The award is presented to people or companies who have contributed significantly to “the success of human space flight missions” — from the astronauts at NASA.

Last Monday, Omega’s Speedmaster “Silver Snoopy Award 50thAnniversary” watch got a lot of fans scrambling to make a booking, especially those owning the beloved Dark Side of the Moon watch. This new watch has Snoopy on the dial and case back. In 42 mm stainless steel, with an Ag925 silver dial, it features our favourite beagle as an embossed silver medallion on the blue subdial at 9 o’clock. The legendary tachymeter scale is shown in white enamel on a blue ceramic [ZrO2] bezel ring, and includes a nod to Speedmaster history with a dot over ninety. The colour theme continues on the silver dial with blue PVD angle-shaped hour markers and hands. The NAIAD lock keeps all caseback engravings in the correct, upright position, including tributes to Apollo 13 and the Silver Snoopy Award. The watch’s blue nylon fabric strap matches the other blue elements of the watch, and even features the trajectory of the Apollo 13 mission embossed on the lining.

The Omega Snoopy Speedmaster

One of the most charming features of the Snoopy Speedmaster is that, on the case back, Snoopy appears inside his Command and Service Module (CSM) on a magical hand. When the chronograph seconds hand is used, Snoopy takes a trip around the far side of the moon, which has been decorated on the sapphire crystal using a unique micro-structured metallisation. There is also an Earth disc, which rotates once per minute in sync with the watch’s small seconds hand.

Under the hood of this special creation is the Omega Co-Axial Master Chronometer Calibre 3861 movement. For over half a century, Snoopy has acted as the “watchdog” for NASA’s safety programme. As well as representing total mission success, he can also keep things light in serious situations — so, it’s only right that legacy continues into the watch wearers of today who only hope to be as resourceful as the astronauts of Apollo 13. Priced at approximately $9,600 USD. Details: omegawatches.com

Barcelona’s Desigual in India

That the retail business in India is getting back on track is evident. Among the new international brands launching now is Spanish clothing brand, Desigual, brought in by Tablez Retail Group. The flagship store was launched last week at DLF Avenue, Saket, in New Delhi. The brand, known for its cool Mediterranean spirit, s also available online on Myntra and Shopper’s Stop.

Nylangan for daily wear

Talking about new brands, Nylangan, a womenswear line from industry veteran Ameet Panchal (CEO of Ethnicity), features kurtas, dresses and other daily wear. Backed by an all-women team of designers, they offer multiple ways of styling each of their garments, such as buttons to adjust the length of the slit on a kurta (so you can choose to wear it as a dress or over pants). What we like: utilitarian pockets on kurtas and dresses. Inspired by nature, the debut collection has an earthy colour palette with pastel accents. The simple silhouettes have minimal embellishments, mostly in the form of subtle accent embroidery and tassels.

275,2020/10/12,"COVID situation critical in Kozhikode, test positivity rate at 18.01%","4,824 sample tests give 869 positive results for SARS-CoV-2

Test positivity rate of COVID-19 cases in Kozhikode, the percentage of people who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during lab tests per a given sample size, on Monday was reported to be 18.01% even as the district administration termed the situation here as “very critical”.

According to the District Medical Officer, 869 people tested positive for the virus when 4,824 samples were tested and 5,549 results were made available in the past 24 hours. The ideal test positivity rate is below 5%. As many as 806 of these people acquired the infection through local transmission and the source was unknown in 55 cases. Payyoli, Peruvayal and Kozhikode Corporation are the clusters in the district with a large number of infected persons. The number of active cases stands at 11,058.

Eleven deaths were reported from Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, in the past two days. They include a five-month-old baby from Malappuram. Eight of them were reported on Sunday and the rest on Monday.

Alert sounded

District Collector S. Sambasiva Rao said in a release that an alert had been sounded in view of the opinion of health experts. The number of cases is spiralling every day and there is a rise in symptomatic patients as well. It had come to such a pass that the hospitals in the district would not be able to handle the caseload. Senior citizens, people with other health issues, and those with reduced immunity are at risk. Pointing out that the rise in the number of cases might also lead to more deaths, Mr. Rao called for strict enforcement of the COVID protocol.

Meanwhile, the authorities are planning to form ‘Jagrata Communities’ of 20 houses each in every wards of local bodies.

The Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti (KVVES) will resort to a district-wide token strike on Thursday demanding more freedom for the operation of commercial establishments and shops in containment zones.

According to KVVES leaders, all shops, except pharmacies, will remain closed as part of the strike, which is also a protest against implementing ‘unjust regulations’ by the police in the name of COVID-19 protocol.

“We have already conveyed our demands to the District Collector, but there was no favourable action. Last week, many shops were forcibly closed by the police and it should not happen again,” said KVVES district general secretary K. Sethumadhavan.

KVVES functionaries also said traders across the State would launch a State-wide agitation if the authorities were acting hostile towards them.

277,2020/10/12,"At last, govt. sets the ball rolling for Kozhikode bypass expansion","Union Minister to lay foundation stone for ₹1,853.42-crore project

The proposed Kozhikode bypass widening project, which has been hanging fire for quite some time, will get a fresh lease of life when Minister for Road, Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari lays the foundation stone for the project online on Tuesday.

The project will be part of the ₹11, 571.23-crore package for seven projects under the National Highway Development in the State. The cost of the construction of the six-lane Kozhikode bypass stretching from Vengalam to Idimuzhikkal ( 28.4 km) will be ₹1,853.42 crore. The cost escalated from ₹1,710-crore when the project was awarded to a Hyderabad-based company in April 2018. Incidentally, the cost of the project had been pegged at ₹1,450 crore when it was conceived in 2016.

New bridge

Mr. Gadkari will also lay the foundation for Palolipalam- Moorad bridge on the 2.1-km six-lane road. It would be built at a cost of ₹210.21 crore, Public Work Department sources said.

NHAI plan

The new development comes at a time when the National Highways Authorities of India (NHAI) is planning to go for retendering the bypass project after cancelling the contract awarded to Krishna Mohan Construction Private Limited, which had failed to secure the bank guarantee of ₹85.50 crore for the project.

Now, with the support of the State government, INKEL Ltd. (Infrastructure Kerala Limited), a public-private partnership company, has decided to partner with the project.

The expansion of the bypass was envisaged under the National Highway Development Project Phase III. The government will share 40% of the cost to start the work while the contractor will have to make the remaining investment.

The proposal included construction of eight overbridges at Ramanattukara Junction, Azhinjilam, Pantheerankavu, Hi-lite Mall Junction, Cyber Park, Thondayad, Pooladikunnu and Vengalam Junction besides four underpasses at Vayalkkara, Kadathumpara, Mokavoor and Ambalappadi.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/o00pg3/article32563366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvkzbypass2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/at-last-govt-sets-the-ball-rolling-for-kozhikode-bypass-expansion/article32835777.ece

The conventional auction procedures will not be allowed in the harbour areas as part of the physical distancing protocol. Buyers will have to accept the prices fixed by the harbour management committees.

Wearing of masks will be compulsory for all fishers and allied workers. Boat owners will be responsible for disinfecting boats after each service. Incident commanders will monitor the safety aspects and promptly report suspected cases to the authorities.

S. Muthulakshmi, wife of N. Solainathan, a Scheduled Caste conservancy worker who died due to asphyxiation while cleaning drainage in a gated community in Kochadai in 2016, petitioned the Collector on Monday seeking a government job and compensation.

Ms. Muthulakshmi, who was accompanied by her five-year-old son and family members, said that the family had received ₹10 lakh as compensation from the members of the gated community.

An order from the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in September said that the officials had to consider the petitioner’s representation and disburse benefits due to her as per the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (Amendment Ordinance) 2014.

Ms. Muthulakshmi petitioned the Collector, demanding the government to give her a compensation of ₹8.25 lakh, a monthly pension of ₹5,000, a government job for a family member, vacant land and support for her child’s education.

“I work as a sanitary worker at two private textile stores and earn a pittance. It is hardly sufficient to run the family and hence I often borrow to make ends meet,” she said.

287,2020/10/12,Tamil Nadu: SC man made to prostrate at feet of caste Hindu man,"I felt humiliated as the video was posted on social media, says victim

The Kayathar police have registered case against seven persons, all belonging to an intermediate caste, for allegedly forcing a shepherd from Scheduled Caste to prostrate at the feet of one of them after the lamb of the victim accidentally got mixed up with their herd.

In his complaint, A. Paulraj, 60, from Olaikulam in Kayathar taluk, said he had taken his 90 sheep and 10 goats for grazing inside the now dry Thirumangalakurichikulam tank last Thursday (October 8). S. Sivasangu, an intermediate caste Hindu from the same village, had also taken his sheep and the goat inside the waterbody for grazing.

When a lamb of Paulraj entered the herd of Sivasangu, the former tried to take the lamb back to his herd. “Agitated over this, Sivasangu, after verbally abusing me by referring my caste, tried to attack me with a club,” he said. Later Sivasangu went to the village and mobilised his relatives S. Periyamari, S. Veeraiya, P. Mahendran, S. Maharajan, S. Sangilipandi and S. Udaiyammal, “who assaulted me and threatened that they would kill me,” said Paulraj in his complaint submitted to Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar.

The victim also alleged that they forced him prostrate at the feet of Sivasangu many times as a mark of apologising to him even as Mahendran and Maharajan were allegedly recording it with their mobile phones. “Since they posted this video on social media, I felt humiliated and submit this complaint seeking stern action against all the accused involved in this crime under the SC / ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,” said Paulraj.

The complaint was referred to the Kayathar police station. A case was registered against Sivasangu and others on Monday under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 294(b) (uttering obscenities in public), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506(ii) (criminal intimidation) of The Indian Penal Code, read with sections 3(i)(r), 3(i)(s) and 3(2)(v)a of The SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, read with 66 of IT Act.

Raising objection to ice plants coming up in Thangachimadam panchayat and Rameswaram municipal areas, residents of these areas submitted a petition to Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao here on Monday.

R. Manikannan of the Communist Party of India, said about 5,000 people depended on farming such as raising coconut plantations, flowers and plantains for their livelihood in this region. There was a small water source for them. When the residents approached the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court praying for a direction to close down the illegally functioning ice plants, the court ordered in their favour stating that the Coastal Regulation Act should not be violated.

But the Rameswaram municipality had issued a no-objection certificate (NoC) to set up a new ice plant here. Already, areas such as Satya Nagar, Ariyankaadu and Thenkuda were full of garbage, mainly plastic waste. When the residents urged the municipal officials not to use the open spaces for dumping plastic waste, they said that new ice plant would help solve the issue. Again, when the residents cited a court order that no ice plant or drilling activities shall be carried out within a five km radius, the officials did not have a proper reply.

The workers engaged in setting up the ice plant unit were working round-the-clock and soon it may start functioning. This should be stopped.

Moreover, the Collector must direct the municipal authorities to stop dumping the waste, especially plastic waste, in the low-lying areas, because during the rainy season, there was a stench in the air and the residents feared health complications. During this COVID-19 pandemic times, when the district administration had been appealing to keep the surroundings clean, the municipal and panchayat officials themselves were neglecting the diktat, the petition read.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/fq3hq9/article32837110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MARMD-CPI-M,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/thangachimadam-residents-demand-closure-of-ice-plant/article32837113.ece

Environmental activists and shopkeepers condemned chopping of trees on West and North Masi streets here for construction of underground drainage and providing water pipeline connections under the Smart Cities Mission.

S. Sridhar, a member of Mannin Marangal Pathukappu Iyakkam who petitioned the Collector on Monday regarding this issue, said that around 15 huge, decades-old trees were felled on the Masi streets. “It even included kadamba trees and athi (fig) trees,” he said.

“Around six months back, Corporation officials tried to cut a huge peepal tree on West Masi Street. Several environmentalists opposed it. But, a few days back, the huge tree was chopped for the Smart City project,” he said.

D. Thilagar Raj of Vaagai Sooda Vaa Foundation said that many of the trees that were planted seven years back by the members were all felled for the project.

Trees were known as the lungs of cities, said Mr. Sridhar. “Hundreds of vehicles ply on the four Masi streets every day, causing high levels of air pollution. The trees are crucial to address this issue,” he said.

Concurring with this viewpoint, M. Karthik Raja, a shopkeeper on West Masi Street, said that apart form containing the spread of COVID-19 virus, the face masks are also helpful in fighting against the rising dust pollution in the city. “Corporation officials did not seek the public’s consent before felling trees,” he added.

I. Gubendran of Mannin Marangal Pathukappu Iyakkam said that the officials were planning to chop the remaining trees on these roads. The officials took no steps towards transplanting trees to secure places, said Mr. Thilagar Raj.

Mr. Sridhar said that the trees that were earlier transplanted from Kalavasal have withered as the officials transplanted them in a wrong method.

However, City Engineer S. Arasu said that they would transplant all chopped trees and move them to Vellaikkal.

Speaking to reporters, P. Ayyakannu, president of Farmers’ Association for National – South Indian Rivers Linking, who led the protest, said the rulers who were praising ‘farmers as the backbone of India’ during their electioneering, were smashing agriculturists’ backbone after coming to power and treating them like slaves. A private sugar factory at Vasudevanallur had not paid a whopping sum for the sugarcane procured from farmers for two years while law states that the erring sugar factory could be brought under distrained proceedings if the amount was not settled within 14 days of procurement.

Similarly, another sugar factory in Tamil Nadu had not paid ₹200 crore to the farmers for the sugarcane procured from them.

Condemning the detention of Jesuit priest Rev. Fr. Stan Swamy SJ, who was working for the cause of downtrodden and other vulnerable sections of the society in Bihar and Jharkhand by the National Investigating Agency, People’s Citizenship Protection Movement and political parties staged a demonstration here on Monday.

The protestors demanded the immediate and unconditional release of the 83-year-old priest. Speakers at the agitation said the priest, who had been working for the cause of tribal people in Bihar and Jharkhand over the past 50 years, had published several reports about the pathetic condition of those people whose rights had been denied by the powerful. When they were being chased away from their homelands, Rev. Fr. Stan was creating awareness of their rights, promised by the Indian Constitution.

Against this backdrop, he had been detained by the NIA in connection with Bhima Koregan case after he cooperated with the investigating agency for interrogation for several hours that spread over a few months. Though he was willing to cooperate with the NIA for investigation either in the place he was residing or online investigation, he had been taken to Mumbai for further investigation despite his poor health and old age.

The speakers, who termed the arrest as a ‘conspiracy,’ said Rev. Fr. Stan had been targeted by the official machinery as he was creating awareness among the tribal people how they were exploited by the people in power. “Hence, Rev. Fr. Stan should be released unconditionally and immediately,” the speakers said.

302,2020/10/12,Union government urged to allow net metering for all rooftop solar systems,"The Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) has said that the Union Ministry of Power should allow net metering for all rooftop solar systems irrespective of their size.

Net metering is a system that gives solar energy owners credits for power that they add to the grid.

In its response to the Draft Electricity (Rights of Consumer) Rules 2020, the chamber said that only if consumers have generated excess solar energy (over and above what they can consume themselves), would the customer then sell it to a power distribution company (DISCOM) at a rate fixed by the regulator. With net metering, there would remain a powerful incentive for today’s consumers to become “prosumers”.

The chamber’s response was to a September 9, 2020 letter from the Ministry to all chambers of commerce seeking their comments on the draft rules.

Responding to it, KCCI president Isaac Vas said in a recent letter to the Ministry that the chamber commended the Ministry for coming up with the rules as such electricity (rights of consumer) rules were non-existing to protect the rights of consumers and “prosumers”.

“However, on reading certain draft rules, it appears that the existing rights of consumers are curtailed by the very rules that are made to protect them. It is prayed that the rights of the consumers should be favourable to the consumers instead of curtailing them,” he said.

Mr. Vas said that it is a well-known fact that small businesses and MSMEs are the largest consumers of power and the largest provider of employment. However, nowhere in the rules has any mention been made that the volume of minimum power load these consumers should be eligible to draw under LT connections.

“We request that consumers should be able to draw 150 KW as LT connection across all DISCOMs and States and in case of mixed load installation, (which means if the building has residential and commercial area), the limit there should be increased to 250 KW, so that, small complexes can have individual power meters. This right to have minimum eligible load for a consumer may be added in the rules,” he said.

Relating to metering, the rules should specify whether it should be smart pre-payment meter or prepayment meter. There should be wide consultation with all stakeholders before implementation on mandatory prepayment meter. The State Commission should have power to specify for which class of consumers the prepayment meter should be made mandatory, the letter said.

Referring to online payment, the rules state that bill amount for more than ₹ 1,000 or amount specified by the Commission shall be mandatorily be paid online. This restricts the rights of the consumers in making different modes of payments, including by cheque/demand draft. Various consumers such as non-profit entity, associations, residential associations, trust, senior citizen may not use the online payment facility. Further, a limit of ₹ 1,000 is very small. Many people in rural area may not access to the online payment system. Hence, the limit should be raised to ₹ 10,000 for payment mode other than cash, the chamber said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/i36u5v/article32840946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30NDYUTHIKA02STH31BUSOLARjpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/union-government-urged-to-allow-net-metering-for-all-rooftop-solar-systems/article32836403.ece
303,2020/10/12,Super-speciality medicine block to come up at Wenlock Hospital,"District tuberculosis prevention office building to be demolished

An old residential house, which hosted the district offices of tuberculosis prevention, leprosy and blindness prevention, on the premises of the Government Wenlock Hospital here will be demolished to construct a five-storeyed super-speciality medicine block of the hospital under the Smart City Mission.

Notices have been served on the district offices asking them to vacate from the old residential building.

The old residential building, which is behind the hospital’s Regional Advanced Paediatric Care Centre, belonged to the family of Albuquerque. It was in 1962 that the family gave this house to the District Health and Family Welfare Department for setting up the District Tuberculosis Centre. Subsequently, the district units of leprosy and blindness prevention were also opened in the building.

The District Tuberculosis Centre in Mangaluru was among the 400 centres that were opened across the country as part of the National Tuberculosis Prevention programme. Changes were made to the building to make space for stocking first line and second line drugs. Space was also created for holding training sessions for activists, health workers and doctors involved in the prevention of tuberculosis.

At present, the District Tuberculosis Centre is monitoring the health of 809 patients. While 685 patients are being seen in government hospitals, including those in the Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Centre in Wenlock Hospital, 124 patients are being seen by private doctors.

Mangaluru Smart City Limited will construct the super-speciality medicine block at an estimated cost of ₹ 35 crore. It will have a 30-bed ICU, 12 modular operation theatres and a 100-bed post operative ward.

The construction of this new block is part of MSCL's project to develop the whole campus of the hospital. It has been proposed to widen the road connecting the hospital's OPD block and the office of the Indian Medical Association, Dakshina Kannada.

The District Tuberculosis office and two other offices are being temporarily shifted to the District Drugs Warehouse. “We are making arrangements to have the District Tuberculosis Centre in the administrative block of the Wenlock Hospital,” Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra told The Hindu.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/super-speciality-medicine-block-to-come-up-at-wenlock-hospital/article32836127.ece
304,2020/10/12,Activists seek government medical college for city,"Social activists and people from different professions staged a dharna in front of the office of Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath here on Monday demanding that a government medical college be set up in the city and the Government Wenlock and Lady Goschen Hospitals be upgraded as super-speciality hospitals.

They also sought more facilities in other government hospitals and primary health centres (PHCs) and filling of vacant posts in community health centres and PHCs. The activists demanded 100-bed hospitals in each taluk headquarters and urged the government to regulate private hospitals from charging exorbitant charges for treatment.

The protest was organised by the Democratic Youth Federation of India.

Addressing the gathering, Communist Party of India (Marxist) district secretary Vasanth Achari said that their demands have been pending for long. The COVID-19 situation has only helped in reviving these demands.

“I am glad to see the support that this protest has received on the social media. We need to make this as a public movement and bring pressure to bear on elected representatives in fulfilling these demands,” he said.

Mr. Achari said that a majority of those who died of COVID-19 infection, which included some CPI(M) activists, could not get the necessary treatment in time. “We need to fight and ensure that the common man gets treatment at the right time,” he said.

DYFI State president Muneer Katipalla said that it was unfortunate that the district does not have a government medical college. Private medical colleges are taking advantage of the poor state of government hospitals. A commercial outlook of the private medical colleges has hurt people in the district. Similar protests will be held in front of the offices of all other MLAs in the district.

Physician Devidas Shetty said that the district requires an unit of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

Advocate Dinesh Hegde Ullepady said that treatment cost of COVID-19 infected people should be fully borne by the government.

Communist Party of India District leader V. Seetaram Berinje also spoke.

Mr. Kamath received a memorandum from the activists and assured them of the State government initiating action in the matter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/activists-seek-government-medical-college-for-city/article32835972.ece
305,2020/10/12,"Area under paddy up by 4.11 % in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi","Area under paddy in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts put together has gone up by 4.11 % during this kharif season.

Agriculture Department officials attribute it to some farmers who otherwise had left their paddy fields fallow returning to farming and some youth who were working in cities and towns elsewhere returning to the roots of their family farming due to the COVID-19 situation.

According to the department, the area under paddy in the two districts went up by 1,857 hectares to 46,998 hectares in this season from 45,141 hectares in the last kharif season.

Paddy cultivation was high in Dakshina Kannada which registered an 8.03 % increase when compared to 2.93 % growth in Udupi district.

The area under paddy shot up by 837 hectares to 11,248 hectares from 10,411 hectares in Dakshina Kannada. It was up by 1,020 hectares to 35,750 hectares from 34,730 hectares in Udupi district.

Joint Director, Agriculture, Udupi, H. Kempe Gowda, told The Hindu that as per information gathered by the department, some persons who have returned to their native places due to the COVID-19 situation have taken up farming in their family-owned paddy fields which had been left fallow. They are now staying back in the villages.

Normally, Mr. Kempe Gowda said, the department used to distribute paddy seeds from the second week of May before the onset of monsoon. But there was demand for seeds this year in April itself. Hence, seeds were distributed after the second week of April.

The Joint Director said that if the department had distributed about 1,900 quintals of seeds in the last kharif, this time, it went up to 2,500 qunitals. There was demand for MO 4 variety.

Joint Director, Agriculture, Dakshina Kananda, M.C. Seetha, said that the demand for seeds went up to 790 quintals from 725 quintals this year, which the department distributed.

“One of the reasons for the area going up was that the land left fallow has been brought into cultivation by local groups with hand-holding by the department and elected representatives,” Ms. Seetha said.

Assistant Director of Agriculture, Mangaluru, Veena K.R., said that the area went up particularly in Mulky and Surathkal areas. Some who had returned from Maharashtra, particularly from Mumbai, took to farming again in Mulky.

A farmer producer organisation in Surathkal led by Sadashiva Shetty brought fallow land under cultivation by convincing owners who stayed locally of the need to take it up and also by involving some youth who had returned to their native places due to COVID-19, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bmvnfj/article32840958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16MNPAGE2G1893SJ6Q116MNPAGE2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/area-under-paddy-up-by-411-in-dakshina-kannada-udupi/article32835968.ece
306,2020/10/12,Fall in marine catch leaves fisheries sector gasping,"I have not seen such a scenario in this field n the past 25 years, says Fishmeal and Oil Manufacturers Association president

A month after deep sea fishing began in the coastal belt, the fisheries sector is gasping for breath with heavy reduction in marine catch.

Though many workers from outside the State such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have returned to work in fishing boats, marine catch is yet to pick up.

Mangaluru Trawl Boat Owners Association president Nitin Kumar told The Hindu that a majority of about 900 trawl boats in Mangaluru, which are engaged in deep sea fishing spending 10 days to 11 days in the sea, have begun sailing out in turns. But the catch is not normal. Trawl boats also lost some days of fishing during the last month due to rough sea condition.

Workers sorting out ‘Rani’ fish at the fishing harbour on Sunday.

Mr. Kumar said that normally, fishermen get bumper marine catch during September-November. Catch has come down drastically in this season though deep sea fishing resumed on September 1 after a five-month break due to the lockdown and COVID-19 issues. For example, “Rani” fish catch has come down from the normal about six to seven tonnes a day to about two to three tonnes. Market demands this particular variety of fish for its meat. Cuttlefish catch has also come down from tonnes to kilograms to the level of 700 kg to 800 kg on some days. Cuttlefish has good export demand, while its local consumption is not much. Mr. Kumar, who is a former chairman of Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation, said that marine catch depended on the vagaries of sea, including direction and speed of current and other weather factors.

As the marketing of marine catch has not picked up due to transport issues in view of COVID-19 situation, prices of fish and other marine products have not picked up. Mangaluru Fishmeal and Oil Manufacturers Association president Khader H.K. said that the coastal belt had 21 active factories covering Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada. They are making use of only 5 % of their processing capacity now as many fishing boats are returning with meagre marine catch.

“I have not seen such a scenario in the fishing sector in the past 25 years of my experience as a processor of marine products,” he said. Mr. Khader said that like the other sectors hit by COVID-19 issues, the fisheries sector too has been affected. There is a chain impact.

Deputy Director, Department of Fisheries, Dakshina Kannada, P. Parshwanath, said that the sector is yet to come to terms due to multiple factors associated with COVID-19, including transportation. Fishermen and traders are not getting remunerative price for quality fish used for table purpose. The rates for quality fish have dropped by 30 % to 40 %.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/prn69f/article32829881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12MNFISHINGHARBOUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/fall-in-marine-catch-leaves-fisheries-sector-gasping/article32829883.ece

309,2020/10/12,Cyanide Mohan to go on the floors in January next,"The film to be roughly based on Cyanide Mohan’s crimes

Shooting for the forthcoming multilingual crime thriller, Cyanide, will start on January 15. Mangaluru and Mysuru are among the cities where the film will be shot.

According to the film-maker Rajesh Touchriver, the film is roughly based on the crimes committed by Cyanide Mohan who has been convicted of murdering 15 women.

This film will be produced in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada. Priya Mani will play the role of an investigating officer in the film in South Indian languages, while Yashpal Sharma will play the same role in the Hindi version, Mr. Touchriver told The Hindu over phone.

The victims were from Dakshina Kannada and Kasaragod in Kerala. The last of the convictions came in June this year.

“This film is a crime thriller inspired on the crime Mohan was involved in,” said Mr. Touchriver, who has written the story and screenplay. “I am not glorifying him (Mohan) but using those incidents for depiction in the film,” he said.

The film will be brought out under the banner Middle East Cinema Pvt. Ltd. by businessman Pradeep Narayanan. Among the actors featuring in the film include Rohini, Chittaranjan Giri, Tanikella Bharani, Ram Gopal Bajaj, Shiju, Shaju, Sriman, Mukundan, Sameer, Sanju Sivaram, Riju Bajaj and Rimju.

Following up on India’s announcement of a $500 million package to the Maldives, the Exim Bank of India and the Maldives’s Ministry of Finance on Monday signed an agreement for $400 million in Male.

The line of credit (LoC) will fund the Greater Male Connectivity Project (GMCP), a key pledge of President Ibrahim Solih, a statement from the Indian Embassy in Male said. India has also pledged a grant of $ 100 million for the initiative.

The initial announcement was made at a virtual meeting between External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid in August. “The Greater Male Connectivity Project will lead to greater possibilities. It is the gateway to a more developed and economically-resilient nation,” tweeted Mr. Shahid on Monday.

“Thank you India for partnering with the Maldives in delivering this project with $100 million of grant and $400 million Line of Credit,” Mr. Shahid tweeted on Monday. The grant and LoC come in addition to the previous LoC of $800 million, among India’s largest loans extended in the region.

Maldivians have often highlighted the disparity between capital Male and the atolls that can be reached only via boat service. The GMCP, a 6.7 km bridge and causeway network connecting Male, with islands Villingili, Gulhifalhu and Thilafushi, is the second significant connectivity project in the Indian Ocean archipelago, coming two years after the China backed $200 million Sinamale Bridge, or the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge connecting airport island of Hulhule with the capital, was inaugurated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ex31nr/article32837663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13BUJAISHANKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/delhi-male-ink-400-mn-pact-for-connectivity/article32837664.ece
312,2020/10/12,GST Council still divided on States’ compensation,"This was the third meeting in a row that discussed compensation shortfall without a decision.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council failed again on Monday to reach an agreement on the contentious issue of borrowings to meet shortfalls in cess collections used to recompense the States for revenue losses from the indirect tax implementation.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, however, said the Centre is ready to help the States who have decided to borrow to bridge the cess shortfall.

Also read: GST Council meeting | Kerala to reject two alternatives presented by Union government

“There was no consensus arrived on a matter on which differences exist. The GST Council can certainly take a call on cess, extending the period of cess collection. That was repeatedly reiterated but among the members themselves, the question was — can the GST Council decide if the Centre should borrow or the States should borrow,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

Refusing to call the impasse a dispute or battle with 10 Opposition-ruled States who have been demanding that the Centre must borrow instead of its push for the States to do so, Ms. Sitharaman said the Finance Ministry was ready to facilitate the States who have decided to borrow themselves to meet urgent spending to counter the pandemic.

The Centre has argued that 21 States have backed this resolution.

Parrying queries on the Centre’s strategy in case some States move the apex court on the issue, Ms. Sitharaman said, “We are open to talk with all States who wants us to facilitate a borrowing. Even tomorrow morning, if they come, we are ready to do so.”

Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac said Ms. Sitharaman’s announcement that she is going to permit 21 States to borrow is illegal. “Option one involves deferment of compensation payment beyond five years for which a Council decision is necessary as per the Attorney General’s opinion. No such decision has been made in the Council,” he said in a late-night tweet.

“While concluding the meeting, I did say - can the Council stop another State from what it wants to do? If the States want to, on the back of the confidence that the cess collected over an extended period will pay for the borrowings, can anyone or the Council stop a member from doing that?” the Minister said, while briefing the media late on Monday.

“I appealed to every one of the members to say what answers to give those States who need money soon… all are fighting COVID-19 on the ground. So that’s how this GST Council ended,” Ms. Sitharaman said, stressing that she doesn’t think a State can be disallowed from doing what it want to do. “Many States compared it to the UN Security Council, but is this such a Council where some States can veto a move,” she asked.

If the borrowings to meet the revenue shortfall from cess collections were done by the Centre, it would lead to an escalation in borrowing costs for the entire economy, including the private sector, the Finance Minister said.

“We have already issued a borrowing calendar and if we expand it, the yield on government securities will go up, borrowing costs will go. At a time when India is looking for more money to borrow and invest, can we afford it? The impact won’t be as much if States were to borrow,” she explained.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/w02thl/article32837656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-NIRMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/gst-council-meet-ends-without-reaching-consensus-on-compensating-states/article32837657.ece

314,2020/10/12,Finance Minister’s stimulus concedes failure of ₹20 lakh crore Atma Nirbhar package: Congress,"The Congress on Monday said the latest announcements by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman about a fiscal stimulus is an admission that the much hyped ₹20-lakh crore Atma Nirbhar package was a “dismal failure to protect or revive the ravaged economy”.

The party said the Finance Minister’s intent is really to manage headlines and “somehow believe that the economy will respond to these headlines”.

Addressing a joint press conference, Praveen Chakravarty, Congress’ Data Analytics Head, and Professor Gourav Vallabh, asked why the Narendra Modi government took six months to realise that lack of demand was the main problem facing the economy instead focusing on credit expansion and debt restructuring.

Though the Congress leaders welcomed the announcement about capital investment in infrastructure for States, they said the amount of ₹12,000 crore for this year is merely 1.33% of the ₹9 lakh crore already budgeted for this purpose in the current financial year.

“Today’s announcements are also clear a message that the Prime Minister’s much hyped ₹20 lakh Atma Nirbhar Package announced in May is a dismal failure in both protecting and reviving our ravaged economy….Just because the Prime Minister or the Finance Minister or the Government of India says that this is an economic stimulus, the economy does not obey and get stimulated. The economy does not function like the BJP sangathan or the Cabinet, where some leaders order and everybody obeys; the economy has a mind of its own,” Mr. Chakravarty said.

“A stimulus by definition means something extra, more, additional. What is extra today? Is anything extra today in terms of money in the hands of people to stimulate demand?” he asked, while reiterating that the Congress demanded direct cash transfers to stimulate demand.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/db11av/article32837120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRAVEENKB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/finance-ministers-stimulus-concedes-failure-of-20-lakh-crore-atma-nirbhar-package-congress/article32837121.ece

317,2020/10/12,Intel India sets up centre for artificial intelligence,"Partners IIIT-H, PHFI, Telangana govt.

Intel India said it had partnered IIIT Hyderabad, Public Health Foundation of India and the Telangana government to unveil a research centre to focus on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to solve India’s population-scale challenges in sectors such as healthcare and smart mobility.

The applied AI research centre, INAI, here will act as a catalyst to accelerate India’s leadership in AI while creating national assets such as curated data sets and computing infrastructure with the aim to attract global talent for high-impact research towards social sector development, Intel India said. In his address, Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India was bound to be a robust player in AI application as data was the ‘oxygen’ for AI and India’s huge population, along with a robust digital ecosystem, was going to generate huge amounts of data.

He, however, added that the AI ecosystem must be kept free from biases. “AI has the great potential [for]of face recognition. But the facial recognition process should not show any bias of colour or ethnicity,” he reasoned.

Mr. Prasad also said the government was keen that data of Indians remained protected and “therefore, certain... standards are required to be laid down... there must be transparency in the algorithms... the details must be shared and there must be a trust element in this AI system”. Further, he stressed that users needed to be adequately informed about the purpose for which their data is being used.

Meanwhile, Nivruti Rai, country head, Intel India and vice president, Data Platforms Group, Intel Corporation said that with its unique strengths of talent, technology, data availability, and the potential for population-scale AI adoption, India had tremendous opportunity to lead human-centric applications and democratise AI for the world. the U.S. accounted for 16% of the global AI talent, followed by China (9%) and India (8%).

“Our goal is to make this 8% grow to 16% to 32%... because that’s the need of the hour,” she said. She also pointed that China accounted for 60% of investments that had been made globally into AI, followed by the U.S. (30%) and India (5%).",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/i18ihs/article32837596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13BURAVISHANKARPRASAD,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/intel-india-sets-up-centre-for-artificial-intelligence/article32837598.ece
318,2020/10/12,‘Cash-for-LTC a big blow to tourism’,"Consumer durables see positive signs

While the tourism sector has termed Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s cash-for-LTC announcement a ‘major blow’ to the sector, the consumer durables sector has welcomed it along with the festival advance scheme, calling these a boost to consumer sentiment and economic activity. However, experts warn that this ‘boost’ is likely to be temporary and the measures may be inadequate to sustain demand.

The Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality (FAITH) said the government’s move to redirect LTC funds to consumer goods was a “vote of no-confidence” for the sector, which is among the worst-hit by COVID-19. After eight months of almost zero tourism activity, the industry was expecting the festive season to give the sector a boost. However, the government’s decision is likely to sap funds that could have gone into travel, FAITH said.

“The government’s move is contrary to our suggestions where we demanded that LTAs be used to incentivise travel. But the government announcement will discourage travel as even those who have savings would like to encash their LTAs,” said Jyoti Mayal of the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI). An industry source however, said there will be no material impact on the industry as the LTA money would not have come to the travel industry in any significant way before March 2020. FAITH added that since this is a four-year block scheme, it will also cut away funds for future travel demand for the next year.

On the other hand, Kamal Nandi, president, Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA), and Business Head & EVP, Godrej Appliances said, “The special festival advance schemes will provide more liquidity to the customers for discretionary spends. With the upcoming festive season, this will augur well for the consumer durables segment.”

‘Not sustainable’

Edelweiss Research said in a note that the overall fiscal outgo owing to these measures amounts to ₹400-500 billion (0.2-0.3% of GDP). However, this is not a fresh fiscal expansion as the government is sticking to its existing borrowing programme. “Therefore, while the measures could support sentiments and demand during the immediate festive season, they may be inadequate to boost aggregate demand sustainably... more [is] needed for sustained recovery,” it added.

Aditi Nayar, principal economist, ICRA, said she anticipated the announcement to result in a temporary boost to consumer sentiment and economic activity, with sharper pick-up in festive season sales that would “subsequently fizzle out”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/9kf1qi/article32837589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13BUHOTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cash-for-ltc-a-big-blow-to-tourism/article32837590.ece
319,2020/10/12,Factory output shrinks for sixth month,"Industrial production declines 8% in August

India’s industrial output fell for the sixth month in a row this August, even as consumer price inflation surged past the 7% mark, hitting 7.34% in September, with food price spikes reaching 10.68% compared with 9.05% in August.

The index of industrial production (IIP) shrank 8% in August on a year-on-year basis, quick official estimates suggest, marking a marginally improvement compared with July when output contracted 10.8% as per revised estimates. Earlier quick estimates had pegged July’s contraction at 10.4%.

August’s output does mark the lowest contraction since factory production began falling in March. Output had shrunk 18.7% in March, followed by contractions of 57.3% in April and 33.4% in May. Between April and August, industrial output has now shrunk 25%.

Heightened inflation, driven by food inflation and transport costs, will make it difficult for the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates in its December policy review meeting, economists reckoned.

“CPI inflation came in higher at 7.4% against our forecast of 6.4%... This number will be in the range of 6%-7% in October too as vegetable prices continue to rise and will exert pressure,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings in a note titled ‘Double Jeopardy for the Economy.’

All segments of industrial production contracted in August, including food, pharma products and fast-moving consumer goods, which Mr. Sabnavis termed as a surprise.

“Quite clearly, the initial boost received (after the lockdown began to wind down) has [become] diluted post the unlock,” he noted, adding that basic metals, tobacco and transport equipment were the only manufacturing sectors that saw some growth.

Overall, the mining sector shrank 9.8% in August, manufacturing output declined 8.6%, while power sector output contracted 1.8%. Capital goods, primary goods and consumer durables all clocked negative growth rates over 10% — 15.4%, 11.1% and 10.3%, respectively.

‘Highest in 24 quarters’

Barring March 2020, retail inflation had been over the RBI’s tolerance band of 6% for 10 months and the overall inflation rate for the second quarter of FY21 is now the highest in 24 quarters at 6.95%, said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, India Ratings and Research.

“It appears that the supply disruptions-led inflation is slowly coming under control, as core inflation (5.67%) moderated in September 2020 over the previous month.

However, this is the fifth consecutive month of core inflation in excess of 5%,” Mr. Sinha said, though he was hopeful of some comfort on inflation in October.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/x2ipp7/article32835773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POWER-IIP,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/industrial-production-declines-8-in-august/article32835774.ece

321,2020/10/12,Food delivery volumes in India reach pre-COVID-19 peaks: Zomato CEO,"“A number of cities are now at over 120% of pre-COVID peaks,” he says in tweet

The food delivery volumes in India have reached pre-COVID-19 peaks, Zomato Founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal said on Monday.

He also said it is anticipated that the food delivery sector will continue to grow at around 15-25 % month-on-month for the foreseeable future.

“Happy to share that India food delivery volumes have reached pre-COVID peaks. A number of cities are now at over 120 % of pre-COVID peaks,” Mr. Goyal said in a tweet.

In a series of tweets, he added that food delivery is one of the safest recreational options available to the customers during the pandemic.

“Going forward, we anticipate the food delivery sector to continue to grow at around 15-25 % m-o-m for the foreseeable future,” he added.

“Since March 23rd, 2020, we have delivered a total of 9.2 crore orders — and there have been zero reported cases of COVID transmission through food delivery, or our food delivery agents,” Mr. Goyal said.

A few weeks ago, WHO also categorically stated that people should not fear food, or food packaging, or processing or delivery of food. People should feel comfortable and safe, he added.

“The last few months have been full of shocks and surprises. We salute the hard work of our delivery partners, along with thousands of our restaurant partners who demonstrated great agility in implementing world class safety practices to ensure that our customers stay safe,” Mr. Goyal said.

In September, he had said in a blog post that with the ongoing IPL season and the subsequent festive season, “we expect food delivery in both metros and smaller cities to make a full recovery soon — and resume growing over pre-COVID levels”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/6z6mxt/article25671790.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-DEEPINDER-GOYAL-ZOMATO-BL-1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/food-delivery-volumes-in-india-reach-pre-covid-19-peaks-zomato-ceo/article32833374.ece
322,2020/10/12,Perils of treading the PE path,"Investors must understand the business, cash flows and risks before valuing a stock

Last week, I was interviewing a fresher. His enthusiasm for stock markets was infectious. He excitedly opened his mobile to show me the list of stocks he had filtered using online financial screeners.

He was going to start investing in, what he thought were, stocks that the rest of the market had not ‘discovered.’ And at prices that he thought were true ‘value.’ Not surprisingly, I found many of his low PE stocks were value traps or worthless.

If you are a new investor like him, running screeners through equity apps to pick your stocks, here’s what you need to know about the PE ratio.

PE ratio is nothing but the measure of the price of a company’s stock as a multiple of the earnings that a company generates/seeks to generate. The PE ratio is calculated either using the current earnings per share (annualised) or the trailing, four-quarter earnings or the expected earnings per share (forward PE).

Many stock market crash courses will teach you to ask yourself whether a company will grow at the rate of its PE. For example, when a stock’s PE is 35 times, the question you are required to pose is whether you expect a 35% growth in the company’s earnings.

But growth is not the only factor to influence PE. The market may be willing to afford a higher price for low debt, high return on equity, or steady payouts. Or, it may be unwilling to pay more if there are risks in the form of cyclicality of business or risk of regulations or competition. Sometimes you will see a high PE stock move to a higher PE without being accompanied by commensurate earnings growth.

Let us take Dabur India as an illustration. The stock returned 24% in the past one year, far higher than the Nifty’s returns. A year ago, the stock’s PE was at 52 times. If you had asked yourself whether the company would deliver an earnings growth of 52% in the next 2-3 years, the answer would have been a clear no. If you, therefore, had left the stock and moved on, you would have missed the opportunity of catching a stock with index-beating returns.

At 62 times PE now, the stock was not de-rated although its earnings did not grow last fiscal. The high PE was awarded for other factors such as its high ROE, low debt, steady, if not high, dividend payouts. Hence, unless you view the PE as a function of multiple factors (for which you need to understand the company), the ratio can be quite misleading.

PEs change with time, rate

Stock markets tend to value stocks for certain qualities and with time, they may value those qualities less and move to better metrics to estimate prospects. Real estate, infrastructure, retailing and media pre-2008 enjoyed high PE valuations but have never gone back to those levels in the past decade. Real estate play, DLF for instance, enjoyed over 50 PE post its listing, going up to even 100 times. It is now at a more modest 27 times median PE in the last three years. Once the markets got a grip that earnings growth in real estate was not a mere function of the land book, the PEs automatically readjusted to lower levels. A similar story played out with IT companies post Y2K and is likely playing out with finance companies now.

Interest rate scenarios, too, influence PE. The underlying value of a company is simply the sum of its future business cash flows in today’s value (discounted at a risk-free rate). When the risk-free rate is low, the discounting leads to an higher-valued asset. Hence, in a low interest scenario, you will find fewer stocks with low PE (as is the case now) and that may lead you to believe that there is no opportunity.

PEs also act very differently for some sectors. When your screener throws a commodity company with very low PE, it means its earnings has peaked.

It is likely entering a downturn and may not deliver returns any time soon. Hence, if you didn’t know the sector cycles, you can be taking wrong decisions.

Different interpretations

Another problem is that you can interpret PEs very differently based on how you calculate the PE. For example, in a period of growing earnings in India, analysts tend to use the forward PE (which will naturally be lower as your earnings grow) to hide the fact that current PE is very high. But an analyst who wants to issue a ‘sell’ on such a stock may cite the current PE ratio to make a case for an over-valued stock. As an investor you’ll be left confused, unless you have an idea about the company, its financials, cash flows and very importantly, its prospects.

So, screener lovers... make sure you understand businesses, understand cash flows, and understand risks. Ratios will start making more sense.

323,2020/10/12,Focus on your needs while buying an insurance plan,"Tax break must not be sole purpose of buying a policy since it can lead to a bad choice

Reading up on insurance gives us many answers. It also gives rise to many new questions in the mind. We realise that there is much we don’t know and need to understand. These questions lead us to the right product and the right insurance company.

Once you have researched your needs and the products available at the site of Insurance Web Aggregators (IWAs), which we saw in detail in the earlier instalment of Cover Note, you can make inquiries on their websites.

Answering queries

Following this, the insurance company/companies concerned will reach out to you and take you through the process of answering your questions and finalising the sale.

You can also contact any agent or the representative of a corporate agency or an insurance broker to take the process forward.

At this stage, you will face a lot of hard sell and pressure to make up your mind. Do take your time and be convinced you have all the information you need before finalising your insurance purchase.

In the midst of all the confusing inputs and mixing up of issues in an attempt to convince you to buy quickly, don’t lose sight of the purpose for which you are buying insurance. It may be health or life risk coverage, or may be it is an investment tailored to your needs and time frame.

It can also be statutory as in the case of Motor Third Party Liability insurance.

Except for the last category of policies, a carrot that the intermediary will dangle is the tax break. While it exists and has its value, it cannot and should not be the reason for you to buy insurance, or a specific policy. Many have regretted bad choices being misled by such incidental advantages.

We saw many insurance intermediaries in the last few instalments, here is one more.

Apart from the agent or broker, you can also buy insurance from an intermediary called an Insurance Marketing Firm (IMF).

Unlike other institutional intermediaries (the corporate agent, including bancassurance partner and the insurance broker), an IMF sells insurance but can also be in the business of selling other financial products such as National Pension Scheme (NPS) accounts, post office small savings schemes and mutual funds.

Increasing coverage

The objective of creating this additional channel to sell insurance is to locate intermediaries and their field personnel in economically-backward districts in order to facilitate increasing insurance coverage there. Their registration conditions also reflect it.

About 375 IMFs are registered with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). IMFs can appoint insurance sales persons and financial services executives. The former is licensed to sell only insurance and the latter, with suitable licences from other financial regulators, can sell other financial products.

In such geographical locations, it will be more convenient for the customers to buy insurance from the same entity that they approach for other savings and investment products.

For the intermediaries too, this will lead to better efficiency since they create infrastructure that can be used to sell a wider range of products and can cross-sell to the same customer base.

Q. I am a senior citizen. I am planning to buy a senior citizen scheme jointly with my wife to the tune of ₹15 Lakh for the FY21 and ₹6 lakh in FY 22, respectively. Am I eligible to get I-T benefit for FY21 and FY22, respectively?

Kalyan Kumar Dey

A. Senior citizens can invest in Senior Citizens Savings Scheme in order to avail of deduction of the amounts deposited under the said scheme up to ₹1.5 lakh in an assessment year under Section 80C of the Act, provided there are no other specified investments or expenditure under Section 80C and underlying Section 80CCE.

Q. I work in a Indian IT firm and was assigned onshore work in U.K. under a work permit from January 2018. My assignment got completed and I returned home in January 2020. I did not receive any Indian pay and there was only U.K. pay (but there was an Indian component to it). For FY18-19, my tax in India was 0. But for FY19-20, tax was deducted in India for whole year. I paid tax in the U.K. also for two years. Does this count for dual tax and can I claim my tax paid in India? Also, my colleague returning after February 2020 did not pay any tax in India.

Srivatsan

A. For the purposes of taxation in India, for the FY18-19, you were an NRI and for an NRI, only incomes accrued and or received in India are taxed in India as per the residential status determination of the Income Tax Act. As there has been no tax deductions in India for FY18-19 and taxes were paid as per U.K. laws for the income earned and received in U.K., the situation of double taxation does not arise for this year.

For FY19-20, as per the residential status determination provisions, you still will be an NRI as you were outside India for more than 180 days in the financial year and were outside India for the purpose of employment due to which income tax does not arise in India for the income earned in U.K. You may contact your HR department to understand the reason for deducting the tax for the whole year. Indian income tax return has to be filed for any income received in India for this year. If any excess Indian tax deduction is made by your company, the same can be claimed as refund. However, it is to be noted that any excess tax paid in U.K. cannot be claimed as refund in India or vice versa.

Q. I am a very senior citizen and so, I am exempt from paying advance tax. I calculate self-assessment tax and pay it in the stipulated month. Now that the last date of submission of I-T return has been shifted to November 30, can I pay the self-assessment tax in November and file my I-T return by the same date?

K.A. Narayanan

A. The government issued a Notification dated June 24, 2020 granting relief to assessees by extending the due dates for filing ITR for AY20-21 (FY 19-20) to November 30, 2020. However, a proviso in the notification and a clarificatory press release stated that penal interest for non-payment of self-assessment tax within the original due dates — in your case July 31, 2020 — will be applicable if the self-assessment tax liability exceeds ₹1 lakh. If your self-assessment tax liability exceeds ₹1 lakh, it is advised that the same be discharged along with interest as soon as possible. The return filing may be done at a later date but before November 30, 2020.

The military confrontation between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the gravest since a fragile ceasefire was established in 1994, reflects the failure of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Co-chaired by Russia, France and the U.S., the Minsk Group put forward in 2007 the Madrid Principles as the basis for the formulation of a peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Drawn from the 1975 Helsinki Final Act principles, signed at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, they provided for a prohibition on the use of force, respect for territorial integrity, and recognition of the equal right to self-determination.

The framework

In concrete terms, the Madrid Principles envisaged the demilitarisation of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian majority region that seceded from Azerbaijan towards the end of the Soviet Union, and the gradual liberation of Azerbaijani territory that Armenia had occupied in the 1991-94 war. Significantly, these steps are consistent with the UN Security Council’s 1993 resolutions, calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Armenian occupying forces from Azerbaijan. Besides, the Madrid Principles mentioned that international peacekeeping operations were to be deployed immediately after the Peace Agreement came into force, to monitor the Armenian redeployment; and internally displaced persons and refugees were to be provided the right to return to their original place of residence.

The two Caucasus states also identified more specific guidelines that were to underpin any peace treaty. The most significant of them was Nagorno-Karabakh’s right to self-governance and the election of officials with legislative and executive powers during the interim period preceding a plebiscite. Nagorno-Karabakh would establish judicial institutions, conduct external relations in certain areas, have representation on OSCE forums relevant to bilateral matters and, crucially, be accorded representation in international organisations where statehood was not a constraint. The above catalogue in effect amounts to the grant of statehood for Nagorno-Karabakh in all but name.

A hawkish stance

Unsurprisingly, Azerbaijan, seeing itself as the aggrieved party over the years, has adopted a hawkish stance, matching aggressive rhetoric with a barrage of artillery and aerial attacks. During the oil boom, Azerbaijan’s defence spending exceeded Armenia’s total budget. In the current hostilities, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, has asserted the country’s long-standing claim over the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh, ruling out any dialogue with Armenia until the government there offered an apology. Armenia had until recently talked of Nagorno-Karabakh’s reunion with the country as a precondition for a possible return of other territories.

Staunchly backing Azerbaijan is Turkey, given the deep cultural ties between the two countries. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan even described Armenia as the “biggest threat to peace in the South Caucasus”. Mr. Erdogan has also been accused by French President Emmanuel Macron of sending Syrian rebel forces to fight in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Despite hosting a military base in Armenia and entering a mutual defence agreement with that country, the Russian response to the hostilities has so far been muted. The U.S. is all but absent from the picture.

Located in the main corridor of oil and gas supplies to Europe, Armenia and Azerbaijan have also relied on a nationalist rhetoric and fuelled the dispute through relentless propaganda against each other. In the absence of a peacekeeping force and the political will for peace, low-level frictions have persisted over the years. The adversaries cannot indefinitely delay striking practical compromises to promote their own mutual interest. Difficult as this process may appear, there is no better starting point than the reasonable framework outlined in the Madrid Principles.

329,2020/10/12,"Promised free vehicles, funds? It’s all fake","It is high time the government takes note of the fake schemes menace

Here’s an exercise: Log onto any social media or technology platform, whether Google, YouTube, Facebook or Twitter. Type the name of any of these “schemes” — Free Laptop Scheme, PM Scooty Yojana, PM Kisan Tractor Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Solar Panel Yojana, and PM Kanya Aashirwad Yojana. You will be promised anything from free vehicles to free funds to fake employment offers. While fraudsters have been duping the public with non-existent government schemes for some time, this problem has become more widespread during the COVID-19 pandemic. We live in an era where selling personal data can get a fraudster lakhs of rupees. Many of these fake schemes are aimed not only at harvesting the personal data of citizens, but also duping them financially.

The extent and spread of fake schemes on these platforms can be quite surprising to some. But while other forms of misinformation (commonly known as fake news) are widely discussed and researched, fake schemes do not figure as often as they should in these debates in India, though they are very common. Like other forms of misinformation, fake schemes also cause immense harm to large sections of the public. Unlike other forms of misinformation, news about fake schemes is shared by people across the ideological and social spectrum.

Modus operandi

The modus operandi of fake schemes is more or less similar in most cases. In the case of fake employment and loan schemes, people receive a personal or general message informing them that they have been selected for a government scheme (which most often does not exist). They are told that if they wish to avail the benefits of the scheme, they have to pay a certain amount as processing charges. The fraudsters are available for contact till the processing charge is paid, but disappear once they receive the money.

Some fake schemes do not leave any digital trace on the Internet despite the times we live in. An example is the Gram Vikas Rozgar Yojana, a fake employment scheme. Letters were directly sent to ‘village pradhans’ (sarpanches) in Telangana, Punjab, Meghalaya and some other States asking them to select candidates from their village and send a demand draft of ₹1,200 per candidate to get their villagers enrolled under the scheme. Unfortunately, without checking with the official agencies, many youngsters sent these amounts. All this was done without leaving any digital trace or no phone number. There were only letters and an address.

In some cases, people even lined up before government offices and demanded officials to register them under these fake government schemes. At times, political leaders have had to come on television to clarify that there are no such schemes, as in the case of the PM Scooty Yojana.

Leaving details online

While communal, social and political fake news gain a lot of attention and mostly get shared on social media platforms, fake government schemes appear to have created their own niche in the world of fake news. They mostly get shared through fake website links on social media platforms, WhatsApp messages and YouTube videos. A simple search with the name of these schemes on platforms like YouTube shows us how deep rooted and successful the fake schemes ecosystem is.

Though many people are literate, they still believe these schemes to be true and fall for them. On many YouTube videos explaining these fake government schemes, individuals have left their personal details like phone numbers, Aadhaar numbers and bank account details in the comments section. So, it is not just people’s money but privacy too that is in danger with these fake schemes.

Book Review | Bad News: Why we Fall for Fake News

With no proper and quick grievance redress mechanism, most of the duped citizens blame themselves for falling for the scam and remain silent. There is also the danger that they won’t apply for genuine schemes when they constantly come across fake ones.

Tackling the problem

While the Press Information Bureau and a few State governments have set up fact-checking initiatives, the visibility of these initiatives is limited. The need of the hour is an integrated and concerted effort by all stakeholders to tackle the menace of fake schemes.

For starters, there is need for a centralised government portal with a toll-free number where people can inquire about the messages and file complaints, like they do in the case of cybercrimes. The portal should direct the complaints of people who get duped to the relevant State Police, who should be equipped to deal with the fraudulent practices in a swift manner.

Second, social media and technology companies design dedicated policies, like they do for countering hate speech, to take action against individuals/groups posting such content intended to cheat the public.

Comment | Almond milk, fake news and the pandemic

Third, most of these fake schemes operate through websites which look like government portals. Websites that have names similar to government schemes need to be monitored, and necessary proactive action should be initiated if they resort to malpractices. The same can be done with bank account names that sound similar to real government schemes.

Further, the government should not only print and broadcast advertisements about genuine schemes, but also alert people about fake schemes so that people are able to differentiate between what’s genuine and what’s fake. The mainstream media, both print and electronic, which gets government advertisements, should be mandated to carry some of these alerts. The messages should be available everywhere, including in districts, and in the local languages.

It would also help if there is one single website where people can access all the information they need about various government schemes at both the Central and State levels. The website should also have a mechanism for eligible individuals to apply. While some fact-checkers debunk these fake schemes and try to fill the information vacuum, the problem is too huge and widespread for any single stakeholder to solve. It requires a concerted effort and coordination between multiple stakeholders such as governments, the media, fact-checkers, NGOs and the civil society. It is high time the government takes note of the fake scheme menace.

330,2020/10/12,Food for peace: On 2020 Peace Nobel,"The Nobel for the World Food Programme highlights multilateralism’s benefits

Alfred Nobel’s willed legacy to reward exceptional work that furthers fraternity among nations, eliminates or reduces armies and promotes congresses of peace has brought the Nobel Peace Prize to a variety of causes — from abolition of landmines, nuclear and chemical weapons to addressing climate change, besides conflict resolution. This year’s prize has been awarded to the World Food Programme (WFP), of the UN system, for its contribution to combating hunger in conflict and disaster-struck sites. The Norwegian Nobel Committee took note of the WFP’s life-saving role in the year of the pandemic, staving off catastrophes of hunger in Yemen, Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Burkina Faso. The Prize is a fitting tribute to the aid workers who brave hazardous conditions to reach starving people in theatres of war, civil strife and natural disasters, moving food on aircraft, trucks and even all-terrain amphibious vehicles. The decision to honour the WFP echoes the advice of another peace laureate from 1949, Lord John Boyd Orr, the first head of the FAO, that peace cannot be built on empty stomachs. That counsel must resonate even more with all countries and foster greater cooperation to close the WFP’s funding gap of $4.1 billion, as the world’s hunger map presents a depressing picture with more than a quarter of the population facing undernourishment in many countries; in strife-ridden Syria, an estimated 4.6 million people survive on food aid. Clearly, without stronger commitment from the big powers, the challenge to feed the millions who suffer acute hunger due to conflict and failed agriculture can never be met.

The recognition that the WFP has received can help the humanitarian organisation prepare for a decade of ambition and help meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Of central importance is SDG 2 — achieving zero hunger by 2030 — a target that requires determination to resolve festering armed conflict, and more fundamentally, to mitigate carbon emissions early and avert effects on agriculture from disastrous climate events. As the Norwegian committee has pointed out, the need for international solidarity and multilateral cooperation is more conspicuous than ever. Democracy also needs strengthening to help achieve equitable food distribution and end hunger, a salutary outcome experienced by free societies that also have unfettered media. Several poor countries have suffered a severe setback to their developmental aspirations due to the pandemic, and lack strong institutional governance to manage the crisis. This is a time for the world’s big powers to strengthen the UN system, espousing fraternity, shunning militarism, greening economies and resolving conflicts in the true spirit of the Peace Prize.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/food-for-peace-the-hindu-editorial-on-2020-peace-nobel-for-the-world-food-programme/article32828831.ece
331,2020/10/12,Signalling optimism: On RBI holding rates,"The RBI has clearly sought to talk up confidence ignoring the risks of inflation

The RBI has used its latest monetary policy review to unequivocally indicate that it will prioritise the revival of economic growth over inflation, at least through the end of the current financial year. The bank’s reconstituted Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), with three new external members, unanimously voted to keep policy interest rates unchanged even as it categorically stated that the RBI would “continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy”. Interestingly, the MPC none-too-subtly tilted away from its inflation targeting mandate by downplaying the risks on the price pressures front when it assessed that supply shocks were mainly responsible for keeping inflation above the tolerance band for months. These shocks, it posited, should dissipate as the economy unlocks, supply chains are restored, and activity normalises. As part of the shift in priority it also made bold to project that it would stick with the accommodative stance “at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year”, a forward looking guidance that immediately prompted one of the new members, Jayanth R. Varma, to dissent and vote against the wording. While one will have to wait for the minutes of the meeting to possibly glean the objections that Prof. Varma, a markets expert, had, the MPC’s majority view of ensuring a ‘dovish’ position on interest rates for at least six months has left it little near-term leeway to tame price pressures.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das went to great lengths to emphasise that the current ‘inflation hump’ was a transient phenomenon that needed to be looked through when taking measures to support the ‘emerging impulses’ and helping the economy return to its feet. Through a series of liquidity enhancing and credit flow supportive steps, the central bank reiterated its commitment to maintaining stability in the financial markets, at a time when the resources-strapped Central and State governments are expected to resort to substantially higher levels of borrowing to meet their spending needs. There can certainly be no argument at this point that the economy needs all the support it can get to recover from its 23.9% estimated contraction of the first quarter. The RBI sees a gradual recovery, forecasting a marginal growth of 0.5% in the fourth quarter that would narrow the full-year contraction to 9.5%. It is the inflation assumptions, however, that cause disquiet. From a projection of 6.8% for Q2, CPI inflation is posited to sharply ease — 5.4% in Q3 and 4.5% in Q4. In overlooking the risks that the persistence of supply bottlenecks, cost-push pressures from higher taxes on transport fuels and the possibility of food-price inflation becoming entrenched pose to the outlook on prices, the RBI has clearly sought to talk up confidence.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/signalling-optimism-the-hindu-editorial-on-rbi-holding-rates/article32828824.ece

334,2020/10/12,BBMP simplifies trade licence renewal,"Civic body introduces a transparent and online auto renewal system

Renewal of trade licences has now become simpler, with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) introducing a transparent and online auto renewal system.

An order effecting this was issued by BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad on Monday. Traders in Bengaluru can make e-payment of the prescribed fee through the department’s portal for auto-renewal of licences. They can download the digitally signed approval certificate without any physical touch point with the department, the order read. There is no need to submit any form for renewal, like earlier.

This, he said in the order, was in line with the government’s decision to simplify the business regulatory procedures in the State. The emphasis has been on simplification of rules and introduction of information technology for effective governance, under Ease of Doing Business norms.

The move comes after the Chief Secretary recommended introducing a transparent online system for auto-renewal of trade licences after collection of reasonable fees.

Earlier this year, the civic body had incorporated some changes to simplify the trade licence application process. The process, including payment of registration/renewal fee, was made online.

Traders need to submit just two documents – rent/lease agreement and electricity bill. Traders could also, for the first time, choose the duration of validity of these licences, from one to five years, apart from being able to track the status of their applications online.

Despite all these reforms, the civic body has not been able to cover all trades in the city, what with the number of trade licences issued not crossing 55,000. This is just a fraction of the number of commercial power connections in the city, admitted sources.

According to information made available, in 2019-20 fiscal, a total of 51,563 trade licences were issued, bringing the BBMP revenue of around ₹47 crore. Of these, as many as 13,171 were new trade licences and 38,392 were renewed.

In the current financial year – from April 1 to October 5, a total of 39,160 trade licences have been issued, of which only 4,214 are new licences and remaining 34,946 have been renewed. The civic body has garnered revenue of nearly ₹49 crore thus far.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/xwo21d/article32836899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGBBMPP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-simplifies-trade-licence-renewal/article32836900.ece
335,2020/10/12,Suburban rail project to take six years to be completed,"K–RIDE has proposed that work be taken up simultaneously across all four corridors to avoid further delay

Citizens will have to wait for at least six years before all the four corridors proposed under the suburban rail project are completed. To prevent further delays, the Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Ltd. (K –RIDE ) has proposed that work should not be undertaken in phases but simultaneously across the corridors — KSR Bengaluru to Devanahalli, Baiyappanahalli to Chikkabanvara, Kengeri to Whitefield, and Heelalige to Rajanakunte.

“Taking up a project in a phased manner will delay execution, so there is a plan to start the project in all the corridors and complete it within the deadline,” said sources.

Citizens groups and activists who have been campaigning for the suburban rail network in Bengaluru said of the four corridors, the agency should complete the KSR Bengaluru to Devanahalli line on priority as it would come as a relief to commuters relying on public transport to get to work.

Land acquisition

The authorities will start issuing the preliminary notification for acquisition of 102 acres of land required for the project from next month. However, unlike with other infrastructure projects, land acquisition is not expected to be a hurdle. “More than 85% of the land required for the project is available. For the rest of the 102 acres of land, preliminary notification will be issued,” said an official.

Rail activists have demanded that the authorities make the suburban rail system an economical option for the public to travel in the city.

Rail activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar said, “The suburban rail project involves a huge investment. To lessen the burden, the government must explore the possibility of giving GST exemption, interest-free loans, and others,” he said.

Lakhs of people are expected to use the mass transit system once it is operational, and the pricing of tickets will play a role in determining its popularity. “K-RIDE must also explore other options to make the suburban rail system sustainable by generating non-fare box revenue. These measures will help the public get a transport system at an affordable rate,” Mr. Dyamannavar added.

Another bone of contention is K-RIDE’s plans to run trains with air-conditioned coaches. This will significantly increase ticket fares. Commuters argue that Bengaluru’s weather is such that they do not need air-conditioned coaches, and that people should be given the option of travelling in non-AC coaches too.

“The fares should be such that even the poorest of the poor can use the suburban rail. The cost of building a rail system is much cheaper than that of a metro network. The agency should take up the project that has been delayed for decades on a war footing,” said Rajkumar Dugar of Citizens for Citizens.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/68ng20/article32829991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGSUBURBANRAILWAYSERVICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/suburban-rail-project-to-take-six-years-to-be-completed/article32829992.ece
336,2020/10/12,‘Women are hit hard by economic fallout of COVID-19’,"They are more vulnerable because of the existing gender inequalities, says report

Women have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, especially those who are part of the workforce. Women employees and entrepreneurs continue to suffer the impact of layoffs and business losses to a greater extent than men.

As per a recent analysis by McKinsey Global Institute, women are more vulnerable to COVID-19-related economic effects because of the already existing gender inequalities. The magnitude of inequality is striking. Using data and trends from unemployment surveys in the United States and India where gender-disaggregated data is available, the study estimates that female job loss rates owing to COVID-19 are about 1.8 times higher than the male job loss rates globally, at 5.7% versus 3.1%, respectively.

Dip in sales revenues

Confirming the trend, Ipshita Sen, founder of the NGO Engendered, which helps women in their mid-careers, said studies in India show that four out of every 10 working women have lost their jobs post the lockdown. Similarly, 90% of the women entrepreneurs have reported a significant decrease in their sales revenues.

Women entrepreneurs are relatively more vulnerable in this situation as they tend to operate mostly in sectors such as food, arts, recreation, and retail which are the worst-affected by the pandemic. “As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage economies, lives, and livelihoods, it is already apparent that there is a greater negative impact on women and the progress towards gender parity,” said Ms. Sen.

The second calendar quarter (April to June 2020) employment numbers in India indicate that the number of women who lost jobs was higher, as a percentage, than that of their male counterparts. As per the McKinsey report, women make up 39% of global employment, but account for 54% of the overall job losses, indicating a skewed gender scenario which could be true around the globe.

Such inequality, intuitively, has always been there against women at workplaces and elsewhere. But, the pandemic has brought the magnitude of it to the forefront, said Nirmala Menon, CEO and founder of Interweave, a firm that offers consulting on diversity and inclusion issues.

“The pandemic has brought the gender inequality issue up closer and it has triggered angst and anger. It is becoming a subject of discussion on various channels and social media is keeping the pressure up. Therefore, employee organisations are forced to be fair and sensitive while handling career issues of their women employees,” added Ms. Menon.

Across all professions

B.S. Murthy, CEO of Leadership Capital, a mentoring and CXO hiring firm, said women professionals and women entrepreneurs in Bengaluru are not insulated from the economic impact of the pandemic. “It is true that more women are losing jobs in the organised sector than men. So, it’s obvious that women, by all means, are more affected by the pandemic. It is true everywhere and so also is the case with our city.”

Women across all professions — ranging from fashion designers and those in the catering services to artistes, dancers, and hairdressers — are under pressure. “What about cleaning staff at our over 500 marriage halls, teachers, and ayahs at over 1,000 playschools in our city or housekeeping staff of several of our corporates? Invariably all these jobs are dominated by women and most of these jobs are lost,” added Mr. Murthy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/3oxs0i/article32829907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGWOMENEMPLOYEESATGARMENTFACTORY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/women-are-hit-hard-by-economic-fallout-of-covid-19/article32829908.ece

338,2020/10/12,COVID-19 positivity rate in Bengaluru increases after two months,"This can be attributed to better contact tracing, says State task force member

The COVID-19 positivity rate in Bengaluru, which had fallen in the last two months, is on the rise again. According to data provided by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) war room, the positivity rate from October 1 to 10 is 14.53%.

Positivity rate is the percentage of people testing positive for every hundred tests conducted. After reaching a high of 24.15% in July, the positivity rate fell to 13.45% in August and 12.79% in September. Officials had hoped that the downward trend would continue, but this does not seem to be the case. Since the start of October, the number of people contracting COVID-19 has been on the rise, with daily figures crossing the 5,000 mark several times.

C. Nagaraj, Director of the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) and State task force member, said the increase could be attributed to better contact tracing efforts by teams on the ground. “Earlier, primary contacts of positive patients would be reluctant to be tested for COVID-19 unless they had symptoms. But now, as patients can stay under home isolation, they are willing to get tested earlier. This is partly responsible for the high positivity rate,” he said.

According to Giridhar R. Babu, member, State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, peripheral zones such as R.R. Nagar and Mahadevapura are seeing a surge in cases which coincides with the complete relaxation of restrictions.

However, civic officials said the positivity rate is directly linked to the number of tests conducted.

Hephsiba Rani Korlapati, BBMP war room special officer, said that every city has multiple peaks and lows. “This fortnight positivity rate has increased. Whenever we see a surge in the positivity rate, we quickly ramp up testing further,” she said. She also said that the ramping up of testing is majorly dependent on the overall trend and logistics availability.

N. Manjunath Prasad, BBMP Commissioner, said there was a need to increase testing, which would further reduce the positivity rate. “So far, on an average we are conducting 38,000 tests per day and it needs to be increased to 50,000. All cities that have reduced their positivity rate have ramped up their testing to a great extent,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/5tyg9x/article32829875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGSUNDAYBAZAAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-positivity-rate-in-bengaluru-increases-after-two-months/article32829877.ece

340,2020/10/12,New international air connections to be forged with Chennai,"Air France is set to start direct operations, thrice a week, on the Paris-Chennai-Paris sector, later this month

Chennai is all set for its newest international passenger airline connection, its 27th, beginning Monday, October 26. Air France is to start direct operations, thrice a week, on the Paris Charles De Gaulle-Chennai-Paris sector, which was previously scheduled for June but postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

An airline spokesperson said the 9 hour 45 minute flight (AF108/107) will be operated with a 279-seater three-class configured Boeing 787-9, landing at Meenambakkam on Tuesday at 00.12 hours. The return flight (also on Friday and Sunday) will be at 02.10 hours. For the inaugural flight, the departure from the city will be on Wednesday, October 28.

France is one of the countries India has air bubble arrangements with, and this flight will fill the void since 2019 created by the collapse of Jet Airways which used to fly this route.

However, travellers will have to wait for the city’s 28th and 29th foreign air links, once again affected by the novel coronavirus epidemic.

FitsAir, a private airline based in Sri Lanka, was to have begun ATR-72 operations on March 30, on the Jaffna-Chennai sector. An airline manager said plans were still active to launch regional flights to South India.

In what would have been Tamil Nadu’s first direct passenger air link with the African continent, Ethiopian Airlines was to have started flights on the Addis Ababa-Chennai sector (ET692/693) from April 1 using a Boeing 787.

341,2020/10/12,Chennai police recover stolen gold bars from Mumbai,"The gold bars had been stolen from a businessman’s house in T. Nagar on September 30

Over 170 sovereigns of gold bars looted from a businessman’s house in T. Nagar, have been seized by the city police with help of the Mumbai police, from the contact of main accused in the case, in Mumbai. Though the police arrested nine suspects, the main accused, Moideen, is yet to be arrested.

The complainant Noorul Yakub, 71, has a construction business in Dubai. Yakub said he, his wife Anisha, her nephew and their domestic help had been under home quarantine at their house on Saradambal Street in T. Nagar as they tested positive for COVID-19 . One of their relatives Moideen from Thoothukudi district had also been staying with them. Unidentified persons entered his house in T. Nagar on the evening of September 30 and made away with more than 250 sovereigns of gold jewellery and ₹95,000 cash, other valuables and a high-end car after tying up Yakub and his family members.

Moideen who was staying with the family also had gone missing and his mobile phone was switched off. The family members managed to untie themselves and reported the incident to the police over the phone.

Pondy Bazaar police began an investigation into the complaint and found that Moideen had hatched the plan to commit the robbery and executed it with the help of hirelings. “Moideen, who is suspected to be the main suspect is still at large. Special teams have been constituted to trace him. There is progress in the investigation,” said a senior police officer.

342,2020/10/12,IIT Madras researchers develop wrapping material to improve shelf life of food,"The biodegradable wrapping material has a built-in anti-bacterial compound to prevent contamination, the researchers said

Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Madras) researchers have developed a biodegradable wrapping material, with a built-in anti-bacterial compound to prevent food contamination, and to reduce plastic waste.

Their project won the ‘SITARE- Gandhian Young Technological Innovation Appreciation 2020’. The researchers have also filed for a patent.

Mukesh Doble a professor and Puja Kumari, a research scholar in the Department of Biotechnology led the team.

Mr. Doble said the design would address the issue of solid waste and food contamination during storage due to bacterial growth. The antibacterial compound used in the material is approved by the relevant authorities and does not cause toxicity, he said.

“The wrapping material we have developed also degrades at various environmental conditions. The degradation rate varies from 4 to 98% in 21 days. The wrapping material degraded rapidly in moist conditions when compared to dry ones. Hence, our wrapper is eco-friendly and can play a major role in plastic waste reduction,” he explained.

The wrappings were made with polymeric blends containing starch, polyvinyl alcohol and cyclic beta glycans (CBG). The composition was optimised to achieve the best film with a smooth texture, flexibility, uniform thickness and good clarity. The polymers used are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The antibacterial agent selected includes compounds such as eugenol, chlorogenic acid, betanin, curcumin and gallic acid, which are used regularly in Indian food and are known to possess antibacterial, antioxidant and many other beneficial bio-activities. The compound is either immobilised on the surface or coated or mixed with polymer before preparation.

Ms. Kumari said the team tested its performance by wrapping paneer (cottage cheese), meat and chicken. The samples were placed in 4oC and 30oC for 10 days.

“Our study found 99.999% reduction in bacterial colonies was observed in the food samples wrapped with our antibacterial wrap and stored at 30oC for 10 days when compared with a plain wrapper. This study also suggests that our antimicrobial wrapper can, to some extent overcome, the reduced availability of cold storage units. Paneer is known to have a very low shelf life (less than 7 days) and hence extending its shelf life is a major advantage,” she said.

Generally, bacterial growth is higher when food is stored at 30oC when compared to storage at 4oC.

Mr. Doble said the team was looking for funds to scale-up the process and test the product with more food samples. “We also need to compare the mechanical properties as well as the cost of the developed films with commercial products in the market,” he explained.

Annually around 300 million tonnes of plastic waste is produced and only 9% of all plastic waste is recycled, while around 12% is incinerated. An estimated 600 million – almost 1 in 10 people in the world – fall ill and around 4.2 lakh die annuallyafter eating contaminated food.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6hynth/article32832960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12OCTTH--IITM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iit-madras-researchers-develop-wrapping-material-to-improve-shelf-life-of-food/article32832961.ece

344,2020/10/12,Police operation on in Chennai to resolve cases of missing two-wheelers,"Special teams formed to return stolen vehicles to owners

The Chennai City Police have launched an operation to resolve all pending cases of missing two-wheelers.

The personnel fanned across the city to check for abandoned vehicles on roadsides and in parking lots such as bus depots and railway stations. On the orders of City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, Deputy Commissioners have been asked to expedite the investigation on complaints related to missing/stolen vehicles and trace them.

In the T. Nagar police district, over 200 vehicles were reported as missing this year and cases were booked on complaints received from the original owners. Four special teams were constituted under sub-inspectors to trace the vehicles.

Special instructions have been given to talk to complainants to ascertain whether the vehicle was really stolen or if there were other issues.

They were also asked to check if any CCTV camera footage was available at the place the vehicle was stolen from. A police officer said, “Our special teams fanned out to various places such as CMBT, parking lots in Metro stations, Tambaram railway stations and other residential areas. We have collected details of abandoned/ unclaimed vehicles numbering over 250 from 10 places across the city. We checked those details with the data on stolen vehicles available on the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & System(CCTNS) portal. Over 70 match alerts have been generated and we informed the police stations concerned.”

Of 70 vehicles, 20 were matched using details provided by the complainants in Mambalam, K.K. Nagar, Poonamallee, Guindy and other police stations. They will be returned to the original owner after routine investigation, the officer said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/police-operation-on-in-chennai-to-resolve-cases-of-missing-two-wheelers/article32829879.ece
345,2020/10/12,Door-to-door COVID-19 survey workers wait for their salaries,"Civic body warns NGOs against delaying payment of wages

A section of workers engaged in door-to-door surveys, carrying out checks on temperature and oxygen levels, among other parameters, has complained of not being paid their salaries in the last few months. The workers, appointed for COVID-19 prevention measures in some divisions of the city, complained that the Greater Chennai Corporation was delaying payments.

These workers have been at the forefront of the city’s pandemic control programme and have been crucial in implementing prevention and early detection strategies, ensuring that everyone gets quality care.

A senior official of the Corporation said there were two types of workers appointed as part of the COVID-19 prevention measures. While the sector health workers were appointed by zonal officials, outreach workers or volunteers were engaged by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for working in containment zones and engaging in other COVID-19-related duties. The civic body tied-up with the NGOs and payments were made from the headquarters, the official said.

The sector health workers, similar to those engaged under the National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM), were recruited by the 15 zonal officers and paid monthly consolidated salaries. Around 10,000 sector health workers were appointed for the house visits, to check temperatures, oxygen levels and other health-related issues.

S. Ramesh, a sector health worker in the Kodambakkam zone, said that salaries were paid promptly by their zonal office, by the first week of the month. But he rued that several outreach workers, recruited by NGOs in his zone, had not received salaries for some months now.

Corporation Commissioner G.

349,2020/10/12,Vaccines with a global common good guarantee,"The post-COVID-19 world has to be one that shares the anti-virus therapeutics and the vaccines with the poor

We are in the grip of a historic pandemic; the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, is threatening the whole of the human family. COVID-19 does not discriminate. Across the globe, outbreaks of COVID-19 continue to claim thousands of lives.

Measures with huge costs

So far, we have exercised whatever tried and effective methods we have available to human society against the ravages of the infectious disease: quarantines, lockdowns, hygiene measures and social distancing — all a luxury for some, depending on the circumstances. While effective, the economic, emotional and societal costs of trying to stop the virus through lockdowns and social distancing are enormous and unprecedented. Countries are haemorrhaging cash in efforts to ease the economic standstill created by COVID-19. And as the costs rise, the patience of their populations is waning from fear, uncertainty, and economic collapse.

Coronavirus | Vaccine supplies likely from early 2021: Health Secretary

The remedy for all: a vaccine as a global common good. Although vaccine development for COVID-19 is proceeding at historic speed, we do not have an effective option as yet. Remarkably and what is encouraging, there are many promising candidates already, several of which are entering the essential phase3 clinical trials. Keeping the hope of the world alive, companies are willing to risk pre-financing production, and governments in turn are already committing billions of dollars towards the purchase of the vaccine/s in anticipation of its/their availability.

Right behind the race for the vaccine is the other race — the one to develop proven therapeutics (medicines) that can ease the burden on those struck by COVID-19. These too will find their way to the market, and the global buy up will begin again.

What an effective vaccine is

Being more cost effective than medicine, vaccines provide a method of prevention. They offer protection from infection in the first place, disrupting chains of transmission and saving individuals from days of illness, hospitalisation or death, possible even in the face of excellent care. An effective vaccine is part of a more lasting solution. The allure of that security is immense. It means buying not only health but also enabling economic recovery and freedom itself in many ways. But an effective vaccine cannot be truly effective and humane until all communities are reached without discrimination.

Coronavirus | One in five Indians may be vaccinated by July 2021, says Harsh Vardhan

Herein lies the tension. What will the post-COVID-19 world look like? A rich world that is protected, locking out the vast and potentially infectious populations of the poor countries? Or will it be one that shares the therapeutics and the vaccines with the poor?

History has shown us how to eradicate diseases for the global good of our own countries — but also for all. The successful eradication of major diseases such as smallpox or polio required a global effort and the availability of vaccines to all who needed it anywhere in the world. When Dr. Jonas Salk came up with a polio vaccine that was approved for the general population to use, he refused to patent it. When asked who owns the patent, his answer was this. “Well, the people, I would say,” he told journalist Edward R. Murrow in 1955. “There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?”

We need this sort of leadership — a leadership which will guide us away from incredible profits to humanity’s survival, and lay stress on the need for the open source production of vaccine without any commercial ownership of any COVID-19 vaccine.

Coronavirus | Gear up for vaccine roll out, WHO tells countries

A message for the rich

For the rich world, we would say that this proposed act of human solidarity, to ensure that medicines and vaccines get to the whole human family simultaneously, is really in their own self-interest; not just an act of charity. Surely, nobody will want the virus persisting in many parts of the poor world ready to re-infect the rich world and create new surges where it was under the pleasant thought that the rich had protected themselves from the pandemic. Compared to the cost of the trillions that have gone in the stimulus packages, that is a minuscule cost. The positive news is that we are confronted with clear and simple action that comes at an eminently affordable cost that would save hundreds of thousands of lives, if not millions of future lives. And that is in the self-interest of everyone, especially the rich world.

Already, many Nobel Laureates and global personalities have signed on to an Appeal to Declare the COVID 19 Vaccines as a Global Common Good. We now urge all the countries of the world to unite to pass a resolution at the United Nations to make novel coronavirus vaccines as a product without any commercial ownership to turn this collective wish into reality.

This must be done soon.

350,2020/10/12,Pandemics and the collective consciousness,"COVID-19, unlike the Spanish Flu, may eventually be remembered more for its economic and political impact

As the World Health Organization (WHO) assessed COVID-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, I began to look at the impact of the Spanish Flu of 1918-1920 globally, but especially on India. Like perhaps many others born in the middle of the last century, I recalled family members remembering that the disease had been widespread and mentioning the names of one or two persons who had died because of the influenza, the name they used for the pandemic. Certainly, no elder, who was an adult during the influenza, ever mentioned that it had caused millions of deaths. Nor, more significantly, did any textbook of Indian history focus on the great influenza or mention the enormous number of people who had died when it struck India.

The family archive

My search for material on the great influenza took me to an unpublished autobiography of Kailas Nath Katju, my grandfather. He was 31 in 1918 and had started to lay the foundations of a large law practice in the Allahabad High Court, and also take part in public life. Among pages devoted to family affairs in that period, prominent public events and Congress sessions that he had attended, I came across one paragraph on the influenza. He wrote: “Just as we were leaving Rau (a place near Indore in Madhya Pradesh; grandmother and he returned to Allahabad in the autumn of 1918 after spending a few months in Rau), the great influenza epidemic of 1918 began to afflict India. It was a veritable scourge, in six weeks, it was estimated six million people died of it. It made no distinction between rich and poor, prince and peasant, men and women. It swept the whole country like wildfire, and the number of persons who suffered from the disease must have exceeded crores. By the mercy of God, while all around there were any number of cases, none in our household at 15 Albert Road, suffered from it. It was a great blessing.”

Analysis| How pandemics have changed the world

Overshadowed by events

Grandfather had begun the autobiography when he was in Naini jail in 1942 for participating in the Quit India Movement. Clearly, what he wrote about the great influenza was from memory. While he mentioned a figure of six million deaths, it is now believed that it led to around 17 million deaths in India before it was over. Remarkably, this enormous toll in human lives which amounted to around 5% of the then Indian population is not a part of the Indian consciousness. It has sunk almost without a trace amidst the events surrounding the anti-Rowlatt Act agitation, the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh and the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Jawaharlal Nehru’s biography written over an eight-month period from June 1934 illustrates how the ravages of the great influenza had quickly faded from national memory. Nehru devotes a chapter to the “suppressed excitement”, unrest and expectations in different sections of the Indian people at the end of the World War. He places these as the background for the resentment and anger caused by the Rowlatt Bills but entirely ignores the influenza’s human toll and consequent popular emotion that may have resulted from the colonial government’s inability to provide succour to the people. My grandfather too gives an account of the Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in his autobiography, but the paragraph on the influenza stands alone, unrelated to these developments.

If the great influenza had faded from popular memory in India, it did so in the rest of the world too. The developments of the 20th century that hold attention are the two World Wars, the rise of communism in Russia and its spread to other parts of the world, the Cold War, the end of colonialism and even the Great Depression — but not influenza. As Laura Spinney notes in her riveting book, Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World, “We do not see the most dramatic event of them all, though it’s right there before our eyes.” If this is true for the people at large, it is also true for academia. The great influenza interested only epidemiologists and medical historians; it was from the 1990s that experts from other disciplines started to seriously study it.

Some epidemics do become a part of the historical consciousness of a region such as the Black Death which devastated Europe in the 14th century. It made a lasting impact on west European society. Now, some social scientists have begun to assert that the influenza also impacted decisively in many ways on the last century, including in creating conditions in the Indian subcontinent that led to disenchantment with British rule; hence, contributing to its end. These claims still need to be thought through by historians though.

The impact of this epidemic

Will COVID-19 slip out of the global consciousness the same way that the Spanish Flu did? It is perhaps premature to ask that question when the pandemic is far from over, but one assertion, relevant to finding an answer to this question can safely be made. COVID-19’s toll, in human lives, will not be, in absolute numbers, leave alone as a percentage of the global population, anywhere near that of the great influenza. Hence, it may eventually be remembered more for its economic and political impact than the deaths on its account — substantial though they have been till now and will tragically only increase.

Coronavirus | Government to study lessons learnt from 1918 Spanish Flu

Will the political and administrative ineptitude which led to migrant labour taking to the highways remain in the Indian consciousness? Only time will tell. As of now, the country seems to have moved on from the issue but those who have suffered will not easily forget their trek. And now even with COVID-19 raging through the country, the people’s attention appears no longer to be mainly on it. This is reflected in the print and electronic media which are giving more space to domestic political and economic issues, foreign policy and security challenges to the state and crime than to the pandemic.

Virus in America

Ironically, the world’s pre-eminent country, the United States, has suffered the largest number of recorded infections and deaths because of COVID-19. The manner in which U.S. President Donald Trump has handled the pandemic is a major election issue but some polls even there have suggested that the state of the U.S. economy is being accorded higher priority by many voters. That may now change with Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, catching the virus. Certainly, the irresponsible personal conduct of an infected Trump may sway a substantial number of voters. Indeed, in the longer term, the fact that the holder of the world’s most powerful political office caught the virus may be one reason for COVID-19 remaining in the global consciousness; history records the fate of leaders in battles won and lost, not the countless unknown who perished in it. That is a sad fact.

Why did the great influenza not remain in the human consciousness? Perhaps because of the human instinct that life must carry on and painful memories of loss be thrust to the remote corners of the collective consciousness if not erased altogether. Would that happen to COVID-19 too?

351,2020/10/12,"Letters to the Editor — October 12, 2020","Court on protest

Anarchy will replace democracy if the right to protest is exalted as an unqualified right. The so-called leaderless and organic protest is a myth. One of democracy’s hazards is its vulnerability to covert destabilisation of the elected government by vested interests. Every law creates its own discontents, but that cannot be the reason to romanticise disruptive and sectarian protests orchestrated by agenda-seeking masterminds who lurk in the background and pull the strings on the indoctrinated protesters. The spirit in which the Supreme Court of India’s observations were made must be noted (Editorial, “The right balance”, October 10). It did not call call for a crackdown on all protests indiscriminately.

Worthy recipient

It is heartening that this year’s Nobel Prize for Peace goes to the World Food Programme. The scourge of hunger, exacerbated by the pandemic and concomitant loss of income, predominantly man-made climate change and never-ending wars, represents a humanitarian crisis of inconceivable proportions. The pangs of hunger must be experienced to be understood, and those who have food to eat should not avert their eyes from the hungry. The hard-working and dedicated staff of the WFP are frontline fighters, tackling huge logistical problems and going beyond the call of duty to avert starvation deaths. One only hopes that the WFP receives adequate funding.

G. David Milton,

The Nobel Peace Prize is, without doubt, recognition that freedom from hunger is what lays the foundation of world peace. The award is truly for the millions of food producers — farmers. From time immemorial, they have been slogging, silently and often bent over with poverty, malnourishment and overwork, to feed us. There are years when food crop fails due to various factors that try and destroy the spirit of living. But the producers of food do not give up. While the fury of nature and the power of the virus are news, the story of the struggle of farmers and aid workers trying to overcome these forces of destruction is kept out of the public eye.

Savithri Vaithi

In the passing of Savithri Vaithi, a whole era of undaunted, selfless service to destitute women has come to an end (Chennai, “Founder of Vishranthi Old Age Home dead”, October 11). She was a pioneer in setting up the “Vishranti” in Chennai, a home for such women from the poor strata of society under the aegis of the Monday Charity Club. For nearly half a century she went about attending to their welfare in ever so many ways. Her most courageous act was her decision to perform the funeral rites for the deceased women among them, herself, when she found that their family members were either not available or unwilling to take up the responsibility. This act of hers truly explicated the message of the Bhagavad Gita on ‘nishkamya karma’. She may even be called the Mother Teresa of Madras. Savithri Vaithi comes in the illustrious tradition of progressive women leaders devoting their life to the cause of public good in an altruistic spirit. She deserves to be conferred a Padma award.

C.T. Indra,

Chennai

Ms. Vaithi had foresight and was a pioneer in supporting social causes. Her performing the funeral rites of elderly abandoned persons if their relatives did not do so was indeed laudable and noble. It is a matter of regret that she has not been conferred with any national award for her unique services to the cause of the elderly.

Snail city

In Kerala, the threat posed by the Giant African snail (Achatina fulicais) is growing by leaps and bounds. In the Ernakulam area, the damage to vegetation is colossal. Initially, the threat was confined to the Willingdon Island area, where the creature is said to have landed, brought in through the sea trade along with imported wood or logs. Now, almost all parts of Ernakulam city and its adjoining areas have been invaded. The pest appears to be most active at night, when there is no chance to notice the damage. The snail is ugly and irritating, with the adult almost 20 cm in length. Many fear contracting infections if they consume the vegetables and fruits the snail may have come in contact with.

CSK’s slide

There seems to be no end to the misery Chennai Super Kings is undergoing in the current IPL season. For the first time, perhaps, a champion side may not qualify for the play-offs unless it makes a dramatic turnaround. There are two major problems the team faces: its fragile middle-order batting which is unable to accelerate the scoring rate when batting first or caves in while chasing even a moderate target. The second is there is not a single fast bowler who can bowl at high speeds; the medium-fast deliveries of its bowlers on slow wickets allow the opponent batsmen to step out often and hit those big shots at will. Virat Kohli did that during his brilliant 90 not out the other night. The ‘Whistle Podu’ Army may soon find it hard to whistle.

R. Sivakumar,

Chennai

In any sport, there can be only one winner. No doubt, this year, the most favoured and loved team, CSK. has not lived up to expectation. Dhoni is a captain who has never shed his responsibility or been averse to bouquets or brickbats. At the same time, a bad show or two does not call for physical threats being issued to his family. This is most despicable.

352,2020/10/12,The lost meaning of objectivity,"In journalism we expect the method, and not the individual journalist, to remain objective

Over the past decade, I have addressed many questions about the building blocks of journalism: impartiality, balance, fairness, accuracy and commitment to truth. While readers tend to agree with most of my readings, one area where I fail to convince many of them is the vexatious question of bias. A group of readers feels that the Office of the Readers’ Editor has a way of finding theoretical explanations for their examples of bias in the newspaper.

The notion of bias

For instance, V.N. Mukundarajan, a regular writer to The Hindu, wanted to know whether it is possible for The Hindu to announce, like The New York Times did, that “its editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom”. He wrote: “The Hindu’s editorials remain an island of balance and fairness in a vast sea of ideologically tilted news, headlines, cartoons, and opinion pieces [so much so] that readers have almost given up talking about The Hindu’s unbalanced political reporting.” He further contented that protests and objections are not going to make any difference. He wrote: “I have not seen a single case where the Readers’ Editor has admitted that the paper was biased in its reporting. We, long-time loyal readers, will, however, not shy away from taking up instances of egregious bias. I think it may reassure many readers if there is an explicit message that the editorial board has a ‘mind of its own’, unlike the opinion writers who proffer one-sided views, mostly intending to show the government in poor light.”

It is not only loyal readers like Mr. Mukundarajan but also a section of social media commentators who see the entire news ecology as a monolithic whole. They tend to lump the good, the bad and the indifferent within a single category called ‘mainstream media’. There is a method in this attack, where some words are given a new spin. One word that is often subjected to over-interpretation is ‘objectivity’. Its natural corollary, the notion of bias, gets entrenched in the minds of some readers who receive much of their trusted information from social media.

While it is easy to explain the difference between news and views to an engaged reader, it is nearly impossible to do so to an enraged social media follower. As a news ombudsman, dealing with this issue has been both a challenge and a learning experience. The charge of bias is not restricted to India; it is prevalent across democracies. It has become shrill especially in the last decade.

The question of ‘impartiality’

On October 8, members of the Organization of News Ombudsmen and Standards Editors held an internal shop talk on the question of ‘impartiality’. It was led by Tom Rosenstiel, Executive Director of the American Press Institute. Mr. Rosenstiel explained that in journalism we expect the method, and not the individual journalist, to remain objective. He said of the implications of this: “One is that the impartial voice employed by many news organisations, that familiar, supposedly neutral style of newswriting, is not a fundamental principle of journalism. Rather, it is an often helpful device news organisations use to highlight that they are trying to produce something obtained by objective methods.” He pointed out that objectivity as practised by journalists is to have a consistent method of testing information — a transparent approach to evidence. Expanding on this idea, Mr. Rosenstiel said: “The practice began as a way of injecting more scientific rigour into the practice of journalism, but instead it has turned into a devotion to false balance and other elements of what journalism professor Jay Rosen called ‘the view from nowhere’.”

Substantial charges of bias come from those who support governments and strong leaders. It would be unethical, lazy and unfair to readers if a news organisation is reduced to be an amplifier for those in power. Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, Director of the Reuters Institute and Professor of Political Communication at the University of Oxford, has an interesting twitter thread, “Misinformation often comes from the top, exhibit no. infinity”, documenting how people in power play a big role in vitiating our news environment. Once the pandemic subsides, I hope to host an open house on this question of impartiality in journalism.

353,2020/10/12,Fancy a Kerala Malabar parotta and duck curry from The Naadan Kitchen in Delhi?,"Two entrepreneurial lads have brought us the joy of Kerala food to Delhi, with coconut, chillies, and more than a whiff of home

A photograph of a food-laden table — gleefully forwarded by the partaker of the meal — kept me busy for a few hours last week. The food, I was told, had come from a new Kerala delivery service called The Naadan Kitchen, based in Ghaziabad. I asked for the number (7042255534, 81530384084, 0120-4348258), called them up — and was happy with the first information report: They had various kinds of Kerala dishes, including all kinds of meat; and they were willing to deliver to my neighbourhood.

I was happier still with the food — which I had over two glorious days. We asked for some Malabari parottas, pothu fry, duck curry, and a vegetable thhali, which consisted of red rice, aviyal, thoran, sambar, moru curry, pickle and payasam. I paid a total of ₹1,300 for all this.

The next day, Nadaan’s founder, a young man called Elvin Joseph, insisted that I try out a small portion of his fried pork and chicken biryani.

But let me start at the beginning. The Naadan Kitchen (thenaadankitchen.com) emerged out of a conversation that two friends were having one day, a couple of months ago. One of them was a chef, who had come to Delhi before the lockdown to visit his family, and then stayed back, as his restaurant in Bengaluru shut shop. The other was a marketing executive. They talked about food, and then suddenly thought: Hey, why not start delivering food?

So they created a logo — a picturesque image of a Kerala boat and a coconut tree — and then drew up the menu. They started the service on August 15. Elvin looks after marketing while Bejoi Chemparathy takes care of the kitchen. The food has the authentic flavours of Kerala cuisine, so much so that a young man we know said he was reminded of his childhood in Kerala when he had the food.

Thankfully, it didn’t remind me of my childhood in Muzaffarnagar, but it gave me great joy. The pothu – buffalo meat (₹500 for half a kilo) – had been fried with peppercorns, curry leaves, and a few spices and garnished with fried coconut. I enjoyed it immensely for the meat had soaked in all the flavours of the spices, but wasn’t red chilli hot. The parotta (₹15 for one) was soft, warm and flaky.

I enjoyed the thhali — especially the aviyal, a combination of juicy vegetables in southern spices, and the fragrant sambar, which I had with the red rice. Best of all was the payasam, the ada pradhaman, which was creamy and had been cooked with rice flakes. We shared this with friends who had come for lunch and quietly kept the duck for dinner.

The duck mappas (₹500 for a quarter) was divine. It had been cooked with small onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, black pepper, coriander powder, and turmeric, and the gravy thickened with fresh coconut milk. The meat was tender and juicy, and I loved the spicy gravy.

The pork dish that arrived the next day was again sumptuous. The meat, somewhat fatty, had the flavours of a host of condiments including black peppercorn, coriander powder, and garam masala. It had been cooked in coconut oil with onion, garlic, ginger, curry leaves and topped with little pieces of coconut.

I got a message from the kitchen one day that they had prepared quail, but I decided to give that a miss. The menu includes fish fry, fish curry (₹250), chicken curry (full, ₹800; half, ₹500), mutton stew (₹1,600 for 1 kilo), mutton biryani (₹450 for half a kilo), and chicken biryani (₹300 for half a kilo).

The Naadan Kitchen is the upside of the pandemic. It showcases the best of Kerala: its can-do spirit and its food.

354,2020/10/12,COVID-19 hospitals unaffected amid power outage in Mumbai,"Navi Mumbai implements rotational load shedding; power restored by noon

Despite the unprecedented power outage in Mumbai and its surrounding areas on Monday, COVID-19 hospitals continued to work uninterrupted, said the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

“Even though the frequency of power cuts within BMC limits is less, all municipal hospitals are equipped with automatic diesel generators at all times. Today, after the power outage, the automatic diesel generators started immediately. The solid waste management department was directed to ensure diesel storage. As a result, all hospitals continued to function without interruption,” the BMC said.

The civic body said its disaster management department ensures that all private COVID-19 hospitals also has necessary supplies of diesel to run generators in case of emergency. “No health services were hampered due to the power outage in Mumbai,” the BMC said.

Navi Mumbai and Raigad implemented rotational load shedding throughout the day after the power failure at 10.10 a.m. disrupted traffic signals, online classes, work from home schedules and household chores. Around 12 p.m., power in Navi Mumbai started being restored. “In the afternoon, on a priority basis, we started switching on the feeders providing power to the hospitals with the existing load. Once the work at the main line of fault was completed around 7 p.m., electricity was restored in a step by step manner to avoid overloading,” Rajaram Mane, superintendent engineer, Vashi circle of MSEDCL, said.

At the time of going to press, many areas in Koparkhairane, Ghansoli, Airoli, Taloja, Panvel, Nerul, Kharghar, Kamothe, where power had been restored in the afternoon, plunged into darkness again. “We started rotational load shedding till the main fault was rectified. The feeders were supplying power in rotation so that power supply to hospitals do not go off,” an executive engineer from Navi Mumbai said.

The 400 kV Kalwa-Talegaon line was undergoing repairs since October 10. On Monday, when the 400 kV Kalwa–Padghe circuit no. 1 of MSETCL was being repaired, all the load was transferred to circuit no. 2.

Milind Awatade, MSETCL PRO, said due to the sudden technical fault in circuit no. 2, power supply was affected in Mumbai, Thane and parts of Raigad. The officers and employees of MSETCL worked on a war footing to restore power supply.

He said, as three of the four lines supplying power to Kalwa substation tripped, all the load was transferred to the 400 kV Talegaon–Kharghar and 400 kV Kharghar–Kalwa lines.

“Due to heavy sparks, those lines tripped too. The Kharghar-Kalwa line got deenergised (zero load) and the Mumbai system got delinked,” Mr. Awatade said.

As the 500 MW unit of Tata Power tripped, 1700 MW load in MMR region was affected. “This multiple power grid failure at this massive level at the State Load Dispatch Centre happened for the first time,” he said.

The Bombay High Court on Monday granted two days to actors Richa Chadha and Payal Ghosh to file their consent terms for settling a defamation suit filed by the former against the latter.

A single bench of justice AK Menon was hearing a suit filed by Ms. Chadha through advocate Saveena Bedi Sachar. The suit says Ms. Ghosh made claims in a video to cause damage to the goodwill, and seeks an apology and an interim injuction against her to withdraw her statement, video, articles and tweets.

Interview

On September 19, Ms. Ghosh gave an interview titled, ‘Anurag Kashyap Opened His Zip & Pushed it Inside-Payal Ghosh’ and ‘Sensational Things That Payal Ghosh Told ABN.’

On October 7, advocate Nitin Satpute, for Ms. Ghosh, said his client was willing to tender an unconditional apology to Ms. Chadha as she regretted the statements made.

However, on Monday, Ms. Sachar told the court that Ms. Ghosh, after the last hearing, put up a post on her social media saying she would never apologise.

The bench then asked Mr. Satpute if Ms. Ghosh was interested in settling the matter. He said his client was withdrawing her statement and apologising, but with certain conditions.

He said that after settling this matter, Ms. Chadha should not file any criminal case against his client. “After the last hearing, Ms. Chadha made certain statements to the media saying she has won the case. That resulted in Ms. Ghosh being trolled on social media. But she would like to settle the matter.” He said he would like to get in touch with Ms. Sachar and finalise the consent terms.

The court said, “If you both are settling the matter, then it would be best if you talk to each other instead of others and file the consent terms”. It adjourned the matter to be heard on October 14 to file the consent terms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jxrcbf/article32836052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAYALGHOSH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-grants-2-days-to-richa-chadha-payal-ghosh-to-file-consent-terms/article32836053.ece
356,2020/10/12,Mumbai faces major power cut due to 'multiple tripping' of supply lines,"Multiple operators, including the State-run BEST, Adani Electricity and Tata Power supply power to the city.

Several parts of Mumbai and Mumbai Metropolitan Region witnessed massive power outage on Monday, resulting in suspension of suburban train services.

The reason for power outage is cited as multiple trippings of power lines supplying power to Mumbai and MMR. It has been reported that nearly 360 MW of power supply has been affected.

In a tweet, Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) said, ""the electric supply is interrupted due to TATAs incoming electric supply failure.""

Tata Power, in a statement said: “At 10.10 am there were simultaneous substation tripping in MSETCL's Kalwa, Kharghar causing a huge dip in frequency in the Mumbai transmission system which led to tripping of Mumbai power supply. Restoration work in is in progress to bring supply from the 3 Hydro units and Trombay units once the MSETCL transmission lines are connected. Inconvenience is regretted.”

Western Railway, on Twitter, said that services between Churchgate and Borivili have been suspended due to ""grid failure of Tata Power Company"". The services will resume as soon as traction power supply is restored, it said.

Multiple operators, including the State-run BEST, Adani Electricity and Tata Power supply power to the city.

Supply to be restored within an hour, says Power Minister

In a statement, Adani Electricity said that there is a major power grid failure due to which supply is affected in most areas of Mumbai. ""As per grid safety protocols, Adani Power System has been able to sustain and islanded,"" it said.

""Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited is currently supplying to critical services in Mumbai Around 385MW through AEML Dahanu generation. Our teams are working to restore the supply in the affected areas at the earliest. We regret the inconvenience caused,"" it added.

Maharashtra Power Minister Nitin RAut said the power will be restored within an hour. ""Circuit 1 of 400KV GIS centre at Kalva-Padgha of MahaTransco was under repair and maintenance and the load was on Circuit 2. A technical problem in circuit 2 led to problems in power supply to Mumbai and Thane,"" he explained.

Power outages were reported from suburbs like Thane, Panvel, Dombivili and Kalyan as well.

BSE and NSE, the oldest and the largest bourses, respectively, which are based in the city, also reported power outages, but added that their operations are continuing normally.

A spokesperson of the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport said operations are normal.

Bombay High Court also faced power outage.

Municipal Commissioner of Mumbai I S Chahal has asked officers to get enough supply of diesel for at least eight hours so that there is no power failures in hospitals especially intensive care unit (ICUs) and asked disaster control personnel to keep handy a mobile diesel generator set as a backup if the power disruption lasts beyond two hours.

The power outage, which is a rare occurring in the city, also comes at a time when many people across critical sectors such as financial services and information technology continue to work from home which typically do not have backups.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/u6e8hh/article32831791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mumbai-local,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-faces-major-power-cut-due-to-multiple-tripping-of-supply-lines/article32831712.ece

358,2020/10/12,Grow your own green thumb with these DIY kits,"Successive lockdowns have resulted in a spurt of amateur gardeners discovering the joy of harvesting their own produce. Now, with DIY kits, grow a dinner of spinach, microgreens and edible flowers

According to gardening experts, the boom in seed sales during the past three months is the largest spike witnessed in the recent past. Interest in kitchen gardening, especially, is seeing a spurt like never before. Across social media platforms, plant lovers are sharing their kitchen garden produce and landscape projects taking place in their homes. Riding on this wave, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) kits have flooded the market.

Gardening kits are the easiest and most rewarding way to go. Curated for the exact quantity of seed and soil that you would need, they are ideal for beginners.

Bombay Greens, Mumbai

Tanvi and Ankur Agarwal realised the importance of being self-sustainable when they had limited access to fresh produce during lockdown. Bombay Greens came out of this need.

“During the pandemic, we were very lucky to have our own vegetable garden. This made us realise the importance of being self-sustainable and we thought of creating products that can help amateur gardeners grow their own produce easily and quickly,” says Tanvi.

While their initial investment for Bombay Greens was ₹30,000 when they started in the initial phase of the lockdown, Tanvi and Ankur broke even in a month’s time and their turnover has grown to ₹9 lakhs in the past five months.

These DIY Grow Kits offer a step by step guide, including set up and instructions, for success. Every kit has three different types of seeds, three grow pots, cocopeat discs, fertiliser, name tags and an instructions manual.

They include edible flowers, herbs, gourmet salad mix of seeds, exotic vegetables, herbal tea kit and detox kits.

(Their products are currently available on Amazon and will soon be available in their website www.bombaygreens.com)

Upaj Farm, Vadodara

Upaj was started by Avanee Jain, an architect turned farmer, after thorough research in organic farming techniques. To extend this knowledge to urban dwellers, Upaj Farm introduced the Grow It Yourself (GIY) kit. These kits simplify different agricultural techniques. They offer biodegradable grow pots and bags which facilitate growing saplings that can then be transplanted into larger pots.

The GIY kits offer a wide range of herbs, vegetables and microgreens in biodegradable coco pot, besides cocopeat coin, soil mix, organic fertiliser and an instruction and observation manual. These kits are made by a team of women from economically backward sections of society and seeds are sourced also seeds from them to help support their families.

“We recently introduced a subscription model: Chhota Kisan GIY kits, says Avanee, explaining that the multi-activity kit has been designed to engage children in gardening activities through different seasons, all through the year round, using fun instructions. Materials in the box are biodegradable or can be recycled.

She adds, “This year’s winter season kit talks not only about how to grow spinach in your home garden, but also how to make spinach paratha.”

Sow and Grow, Gurgaon

This Gurgaon-based enterprise was started by Neha Saharan about two years ago, offering a range of eco-friendly gifting solutions. The pandemic, however, shifted her focus towards DIY gardening kits when she saw a sudden spurt in sales.

Says Neha, “Kitchen gardening kits now account for about 80% of our sales. We have seen great interest in people buying these kits. Even if you have the smallest space on a window ledge or a balcony space with a bit of sunshine, you can make a beginning with these kits.”

The kits are plastic-free and include a coir pot, cocopeat growth medium, seeds, organic micronutrients and a marker stick. Italian basil and tomato kit is the most fast-moving, according to Neha. “We get about 100 orders from our website alone, of which a majority are for the basil and tomato kit,” she adds. The kits include spinach, lady’s finger, coriander, mint, peas, brinjal, beans, thyme and oregano. Sow and Grow also has a seed ball collection of tomato, chilli, brinjal that come in jute potli or pouch. Soon, they will be launching the microgreens DIY kit in five different varieties as well.

The Organic Farm, Chennai

The Organic Farm was set up in the year 1995, with the idea of growing and supplying chemical-free food. Since then, it has focussed on sustainable management of natural resources, including soil, water, flora and fauna.

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, wiping grocery store shelves bare. Months later, the pandemic’s imprint is still easy to see. On receiving a flood of queries for kitchen gardening kits, 36-acre farm in Kalpakkam launched their Greens Kit, a zero-plastic concept with “gro-bags” made from banana stem and seeds, potting mix and detailed videos with instructions on how to grow fenugreek (methi), amaranthus, spinach, red spinach, and other varieties like ara keerai and siri keerai.

“I think people are growing more conscious of their food and health, and they also have more time to spend on their gardens,” says founder Alladi Mahadevan. “The gro-bags take very little space; and the kit is absolutely complete, so you don’t have to run pillar to post to find any other material. At the end of 40-45 days, not only can you harvest and enjoy eating your greens, you can also immediately re-use the gro-bags. We provide seeds for three cycles, so you can repeat the whole cycle, or grow other suitable seeds of your choice.”

The farm is also introducing multi-cropping into small urban gardens by providing germinated sapling and growing many species together in the same pots and spaces. They recently also started making bamboo trellis (pandals) for balconies and terraces on which many pots can be hung. Says Alladi, “These make it feasible even for small households in flats to grow their own food.”

360,2020/10/12,A missing tail,"Little Laddoo loved to eat, but lost his appetite when his tail suddenly disappeared.

Laddoo was a pup who was black from the top of his little nose to the tip of his tiny tail. Six-year-old Riya was fond of laddoos and so, she named her best buddy Laddoo.

Laddoo loved to eat and he had a trick to get everyone to feed him. He would sit on his hind legs, wag his tail ever so slightly, and wear a poor hungry puppy look. It always worked and he repaid his patron with umpteen licks and scores of wags.

Laddoo’s mum, Kachori, was worried that all the food had made him roly-poly. He could not run as fast as the other pups. “Laddoo, you have to stop eating so much.”

“Why, mamma?”

“You will become very fat which is not good for your health.”

Love of his life

Laddoo tried, but he couldn’t stop himself. The smell, sight and taste of food made him crazy. His second love was playing with Riya, and then came chasing his tail. Whenever his tummy was full and Riya was busy, he would go around in circles trying to catch his own tail.

When Riya’s school closed, they spent the day together. Riya shared all the yummy dishes her mum made with Laddoo. At night, Riya had to drink a glass of milk, which she hated. One day, she got an idea and put the cup under her bed and looked at Laddoo. The pup knew exactly what he had to do. In a few seconds, the milk had disappeared. This made them both even closer, and Laddoo now got an extra portion with every meal. He was so busy with Riya that he had no time to chase his tail.

One evening, Laddoo was digging for a bone in the garden. Riya’s school had reopened and she was doing her homework. After some time, he got bored and wanted to chase his tail. He turned his head to the right to reach for it but couldn’t see it. He then turned to the left, but his tail was still missing. He put his head between his legs, but still no tail. Finally Laddoo tried to stand on his head and look for it. He tumbled over but couldn’t spot it. His tail had vanished!

In panic, he ran to his mother and jumped on her. “Mamma, my... my tail… is gone… What will I catch now? And how will I look – a tailless pup...” he howled.

Kachori laughed. “You tail is there. You can’t see it because your fat tummy and your big bottom come in between. If you want to see your tail and catch it, eat less and run more.”

Laddoo hung his head and nodded, as his mamma gently picked him up by his tail and licked him on the nose.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/k0k0mm/article32833578.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16YT-TALESPIN-LEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/children/a-missing-tail/article32833580.ece
361,2020/10/12,Survival skills for the new age,"Maybe we need to change in some way if we’re going to get through online school. Here are some ideas for what we can develop...

Have you read about the theory of evolution and survival of the fittest, in Biology, yet?

Basically, this dude called Charles Darwin said that evolution is a change in the characteristics of a species over several generations and relies on the process of natural selection. Natural selection means that some individuals in a species are better at surviving than others and will have more children because they’re stronger or better at surviving or something.

If online school goes on for any longer, I think that I’m going to have to undergo adaptations to survive.

For starters, I think compound eyes like a fly would be super helpful. After five hours of online school and three hours of homework, my eyes are so tired. Just imagine, if I had a whole bunch of tiny eyes, I could use some for school, some for IPL and some for homework. Who am I kidding? I’d use all for IPL.

Eight limbs are better than four. I really need an extra set (or two) of hands to keep up with all the homework. There are projects, homework, classwork, reflection, end-of-chapters assessments, ASL, AFL, Kahoot quizzes and Jam Boards. Okay, maybe eight limbs won’t be enough after all.

Clever hacks

Did you know that chipmunks use their cheek pouches to carry large amounts of food at once? I’d find that super handy, wouldn’t you? Somehow I’m hungry all day long when there’s online school! But we aren’t allowed to snack during class because, according to our Principal J Ma’am, we don’t snack during class in real school. So why should we snack during online school? But, if you knew there was a dabba of murukku two feet away, wouldn’t you want to snack too?

Did you know snakes can sleep with their eyes open? That’s because they don’t have eyelids! You know where I’m going with this, don’t you? I could just sleep through the history of the Delhi Sultanate and N Ma’am would never know. Okay, she might find out when she asks me a question and I don’t have an answer, but let’s cross that bridge when we come to it.

Wait! I’ve got it! Forget all of the above. Here’s the only thing I need to be able to do! You know caterpillars weave a cocoon for themselves and then emerge from them as butterflies? I’d like to sleep in a cocoon till COVID-19 is over and emerge with everything I need to know to get to the next grade fed into my brain while I’ve been asleep.

Now that’s called survival of the fittest!",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/gint2t/article32832912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16YTBUGBOY,https://www.thehindu.com/children/survival-skills-for-the-new-age/article32832913.ece
362,2020/10/12,When friends come a-visiting,"Toad and Grasshopper were besties. Yet they had never shared a meal together.

Let’s read an African folk tale about two great friends — Grasshopper and Toad.

The two spent almost every waking hour together. They only bid goodbye to each other when they had to go home for meals. Everyone thought it strange that such good friends had never ever shared a meal together. They remarked about this to one another and soon the friends got to hear of it.

One morning, Toad said, “I say, Grasshopper, why don’t you stop by for dinner tomorrow? I’ll cook something special for you.”

Grasshopper was a bachelor, and an invitation to a good dinner was welcome. The next evening, togged up in his Sunday best, he waltzed up to Toad’s door and rang the bell. They spoke about this and that, the weather and the government, until it was time to go in for dinner.

Before sitting down to eat, Toad washed his forelegs. He said, “I say Grasshopper, why don’t you wash your forelegs too?” So, Grasshopper washed his forelegs. But, when he did so, it made a loud noise.

“Can’t you leave your chirping behind?” asked Toad. “There is so much noise, I cannot eat.”

Try as he might, Grasshopper could not prevent his forelegs from coming together and making a noise. Every time he chirped, Toad complained and asked him to be quiet.

Before leaving, Grasshopper said, “Toad, I invite you to my house tomorrow, for dinner.”

The next evening, when Toad appeared, Grasshopper led him straight to the dinner table. But, before he could be seated, Grasshopper washed his forelegs and said, “Hey Toad, why don’t you wash your forelegs before you sit down to eat?”

Toad quickly washed his forelegs and hopped towards to table. Grasshopper frowned and said, “My dear chap, you had better go back and wash again. All that hopping has made your forelegs dirty.”

So, Toad did as he was told. He reached out for some food when Grasshopper frowned again and said, “Please be a pal and don’t put your dirty paws into the food. Go and wash them.”

All through the meal, Toad hopped from the water jar to the table. Not a morsel went down his throat. By the end of the evening, he was livid. “You do not want me to eat with you. You know very well that I must use my paws and forelegs to hop. I cannot help it if they get dirty.”

Grasshopper smiled, “You started it. Remember yesterday, when you complained about my forelegs making a noise?”

Toad had the grace to blush. He was remorseful syet, both friends were annoyed. They never spoke to one another again. That is, until the monkey came by and noticed it.

But, that’s a story for another day.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/s0eoay/article32832907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16ytFolktale,https://www.thehindu.com/children/when-toad-and-grasshopper-shared-a-meal/article32832908.ece
363,2020/10/12,Young palaeontologist walks the talk,"Young palaeontologist Aswatha Biju on Monday spoke on the importance of appreciating and preserving natural history sites in the country at a meeting held here ahead of International Fossil Day (October 14).

A Chennai-based class 8 student, Ms. Aswatha started collecting fossils from the age of 5 and is considered to be among India’s youngest palaeontologists.

“I have been speaking on paleontology in schools, colleges and research institutes since I was 11, and I feel every event is a great opportunity to raise awareness of our natural wealth,” she told The Hindu.

“Most people see fossils as a waste product, and only those who appreciate pre-historic remains, want to conserve them,” she said.

Monday’s talk was more of a primer on paleontology, with Ms. Aswatha covering topics such as identification, collection and preservation of fossils, people she has worked under and how knowledge of natural history is essential to protect the environment.

With the easing of lockdown, she has been able to resume field trips to natural history sites in the State.

“I usually travel and do research work during my holidays,” said Ms. Aswatha.

The school student hopes to celebrate Fossil Day this year with an awareness talk at National Fossil Wood Park, a recognised geo-heritage monument located in Sathanur, Perambalur district.

“We do not have TV set at home, so I have plenty of time to balance my school studies with palaeontology research,” she said.

Organised by Tiruchi Notaphily Society in collaboration with Government Museum, the event included a small display of 50-60 fossil samples sourced from places such as Ariyalur, Perambalur and Chennai.

Since public admission was restricted due to lockdown regulations, the event was attended by local fossil collectors.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ls6fqw/article32838111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY13-PALEONTOLOGY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/young-palaeontologist-walks-the-talk/article32838114.ece
364,2020/10/12,"Come kuruvai season, procurement issues rear their heads again","Complaints of delay/non-procurement of paddy at direct purchase centres (DPCs) in delta districts has become all too frequent in recent days with farmers associations and political parties raising the issue vociferously in public fora.

Ironically, when the issue of harvested grains stacked in the open near DPCs sprouting in rain attracted the attention of the media during the middle of the last procurement season, Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) circulated a set of instructions to its staff on avoiding loss of grains and ensuring smooth procurement process.

TNCSC directed the staff to increase the procurement quantum from 800 bags per day to 1,000 and asked them to issue tokens to farmers approaching the DPC to measure their produce. The objective was to prevent stocking of grains — brought directly from the field to the DPC — in the open.

The Corporation also insisted that its staff sensitise farmers on storing their produce ‘safely’ at their own places and bringing it to the DPC on the date fixed for measuring.

However, enquiries reveal that except for the increase in the number of bags procured at the DPCs not much attention has been paid to other instructions either by the staff or farmers and their representative associations.

Procurement-related issues have started rearing their head afresh this season with farmers alleging irregularity or inordinate delay in procurement of the summer crop or kuruvai paddy. While a section of farmers say they are unaware of the Corporation’s instructions with respect to procurement, the staff are reportedly under the impression that they pertained to the last season only.

They have attributed the delay in procurement process to ‘insufficient’ number of gunny bags and glitches in transfer of procured paddy from DPCs.

Sundara Vimalanathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, has urged officials to use the kuruvai season to try out new methods to ensure smooth and quick procurement of paddy through DPCs in delta districts because the quantum of harvest during kuruvai will be less compared to samba and thaladi season.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/n2az5u/article32838092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY13-PROCUREMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/come-kuruvai-season-procurement-issues-rear-their-heads-again/article32838093.ece
365,2020/10/12,NIT-T signs agreement with C-DAC,"National Institute of Technology-Tiruchi (NIT-T) on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune, for establishment of a 650 Tera Flops Supercomputer on the campus under the National Computing Mission.

NIT-T is among 10 Centrally-funded institutions to be inducted into NSM along with Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, seven IITs, and National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute.

The objective of the NSM is to empower technology institutions with high-performance computing capabilities that can be used for solving computationally intensive problems.

At an meeting conducted in virtual mode, the MoU was signed by NIT-T Director Mini Shaji Thomas and Director General of C-DAC Hemant Darbari in the presence of Sanjay Dhotre, Minister of State for Education, Communication, Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India; Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology (DST); and Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeITY).

Based on the proposal submitted by NIT-T, the NSM infrastructure team cleared sanction of super computer worth ₹17.11 crore by the Department of Science and Technology and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

The 650 TF supercomputer involving Central Processing Unit and Graphics Processing Unit at a ratio of 70:30 will be installed at the institute by CDAC, Pune, shortly, with an additional installation cost of about ₹2 crore.

“With the development of societal projects involving artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning on the rise, NIT-T has been sanctioned the super computer at the appropriate time. The facility will be helpful to research scholars and faculty working on projects involving high-end computing for carrying out various research and sponsored projects,” Ms. Mini Shaji Thomas said.

She hoped for exponential increase in research output and the number of societal projects in areas of health, agriculture, weather, financial services and social media in addition to in-house projects by all 17 departments of the Institute.

The supercomputing facility will be made available to neighbouring educational institutions, as mandated and in line with NEP 2020, the NIT-T Director said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/nit-t-signs-agreement-with-c-dac/article32838087.ece
366,2020/10/12,Manachanallur bypass road to be ready in December,"Highways Department to prepare DPR for second bypass around the town soon

A new bypass road around Manachanallur, which will ease traffic congestion in the town famous for its rice mills on the outskirts of Tiruchi city, is expected to be ready by mid-December.

Close on the heels of completion of the bypass, the Highways Department has planned to prepare a detailed project report for laying another bypass around the town, this one branching off from Samayapuram-Manachanallur Road.

The new bypass road on Tiruchi-Thuraiyur Road, which is nearing completion, runs a length of about 2.64 km and was sanctioned at an estimated cost of ₹25.15 crore.

The bypass, which starts near Panguni Vaical (beyond Nochiyam) at Athani joins Thuraiyur Road again beyond Manachanallur Taluk Office, averting the need for motorists to go via the congested Manachanallur town.

The project was announced in the 2012-13 budget session of Assembly. The government had then sanctioned ₹14.40 crore to acquire about seven hectares of land spread over Manachanallur, Uluthankudi and Poonampalayam revenue villages for laying the road.

The construction of the by-pass road would come as a relief to motorists traversing Tiruchi-Thuraiyur Road and residents of Manchanallur, which witnesses frequent traffic snarls on Local Fund Road.

The narrow road has been bursting at its seams due to heavy traffic and encroachments. Residents of Manachanallur, while welcoming the project, have, however, emphasised the need for removing encroachments to ease traffic flow on Local Fund Road.

The bypass road will be ready to be opened for traffic by mid-December as a major portion of the work has been completed, sources in the Highways Department told The Hindu.

Awaits sanction

Meanwhile, the department is awaiting administrative sanction for preparing a detailed project report (DPR) for a second bypass around the town. Once the sanction is obtained, an agency will be commissioned to prepare the DPR for the second bypass for the town, which is planned from Vengankudi on Samayapuram-Manchanallur Road to Athani on Tiruchi-Thuraiyur Road, a distance of about 2.83 km.

The road is expected to entail an investment of about ₹40 crore approximately. It will also involve land acquisition, the sources indicated.

“The administrative sanction is expected soon and the DPR will most probably be ready by January,” an official said.

The second by-pass road will be of immense benefit for motorists, officials said. Vehicles heading towards Musiri/Namakkal/Salem and beyond from Tiruchi-Chennai Highway and those plying on the return direction can go through the road without having to enter Tiruchi city and the busy No.1 Tollgate Junction.

Similarly, those heading to Thuraiyur from Samayapuram can also take the bypass roads and save substantial time and fuel by avoiding Manachanallur town, officials said.

Conceding that the proposed bypass would be of immense benefit to the town, S. Chandrasekaran, a businessman of Manachanallur, observes that it will be of even more benefit than the bypass, which is to be opened shortly.

“The traffic congestion, especially at Thirupainjeeli Road junction at Manachanallur, will be completely eased. Besides, the second bypass will be useful to devotees visiting Samayapuram from Namakkal/Salem and beyond,” Mr. Chandrasekaran adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/lh5i0r/article32838073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY13-BYPASSROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/manachanallur-bypass-road-to-be-ready-in-december/article32838074.ece
367,2020/10/12,NASA to launch Karur students’ satellite,"M. Adnaan, M. Kesavan and V. Arun took over two years to design and develop the satellite

An experimental satellite developed by three students of Karur has been selected for launch in sub-orbital space by NASA.

It took more than two years of research and development for M. Adnaan of Thanthonrimalai, M. Kesavan of Nagampalli village near Malaikovilur and V. Arun of Thennilai to design and develop the satellite that outsmarted a number of satellites developed by aspiring space scientists to win the global competition conducted by the Cubes in Space, a programme of Idoodledu Inc in association with NASA.

They were studying Plus One when they sat together and began to design the world’s smallest and lightest technology demonstrator satellite. The determination, hard work and perseverance of the students, now pursuing undergraduate courses, have made them proud. They were mentored and guided by Chennai-based Space Kids India, which encourages aspiring space scientists.

The satellite made of reinforced graphene polymer is 3 cm in size and weighs 64 gm. It has its own radio frequency communication to transmit and receive signal from earth to outer space. The solar cells attached to the satellite generate power for it. The photographic film will absorb and measure the cosmic radiation inside the rocket.

The satellite, christened Indian Sat, will be launched into the sub orbit in June next on NASA’s sounding rocket 7.

Rifath Shaarook of Space Kids India, who mentored the Karur boys, told The Hindu that it was one of the biggest moments for them as their model had been chosen among many submitted by young contestants from more than 50 countries. It would study the effect of reinforced graphene polymers in microgravity. It would be in sub-orbital space flight for a few minutes before landing in the ocean.

Helping hands

The young researchers faced difficulties in meeting the expenditure of about ₹1.35 lakh for the project due to their poor economic background. However, the faculty members of the Department of Physics of Government Arts College in Karur, where two of them were studying, and the Karur-based Shiva Educational Trust sponsored the project.

“We eagerly await the launch of our satellite. It will be a big moment in our life. It is like a dream comes true. In spite of financial struggle, we have made it to the big stage with the support of some big hearts,” says Kesavan, 18, son of a salesman in a ration shop in Karur.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/pprh3c/article32838056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY13-SATELLITE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/small-satellite-big-dreams/article32838057.ece

Portugal and Italy kept hold of first place in their UEFA Nations League groups on Sunday with goalless draws against France and Poland, while England saw off Belgium to take the initiative in their pool.

There was not much to talk about at the Stade de France as a star-studded line up of players including Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann failed to muster much of a spectacle in the League A, Group 3 match.

The 1,000 fans gathered in the cavernous stadium just outside Paris to watch World champion France host the reigning European champion were treated to just four shots on target as two rugged defences cancelled out each team’s attacks.

No goals

Pepe headed home what he thought was a 74th-minute opener when he got on the end of Bruno Fernandes’ free-kick but was flagged offside. Ronaldo, chasing his 102nd international goal, was denied by a flying save from Hugo Lloris in added time.

Both sides are on seven points, four ahead of Croatia, whose 2-1 home win over Sweden earlier on Sunday was the group’s more entertaining match.

England manager Gareth Southgate said his side showed what it is made of after coming from behind to beat Belgium 2-1 and move top of League A, Group 2 earlier on Sunday.

376,2020/10/12,Former India captain Chapman passes away,"Led the country to the SAFF championship in 1997

Former Indian football team captain Carlton Chapman passed away here on Monday. Chapman complained of back pain in the early hours of Monday, and breathed his last a couple of hours later, his close friends stated. He was 49.

Chapman — an integral part of the Indian team from 1995 to 2001 — was among the last footballers from Karnataka to make a big impression on the international stage. A midfielder known for his speedy runs and clever assists, Chapman was the perfect foil for strikers.

Achievements

Under his captaincy, India won the SAFF Championship in Kathmandu in 1997. Chapman was part of the Indian team which won the SAF Games (1995) in Chennai, Nehru Cup (1997) in Kochi, and SAFF Championship (1999) in Margao.

He was an accomplished performer at the national club level as well. A precocious young talent, Chapman started his career at SAI Centre (Bengaluru), before moving to Tata Football Academy (TFA) in Jamshedpur in 1990.

His big break came in 1993, when he joined East Bengal. Chapman made an instant impression, scoring a hat-trick in East Bengal’s 6-2 win over Iraqi club Al-Zawra in the Asian Cup Winners’ Cup.

After two seasons with East Bengal, he signed for JCT Mills, where he played alongside Baichung Bhutia and I.M. Vijayan. The midfielder returned to East Bengal in 1998, and led the club to the National Football League (NFL) title in 2001.

After his playing career, Chapman took up coaching. He worked with Royal Wahingdoh, Sudeva FC, Bhawanipore FC and other clubs. Chapman was due to join Gokulam Kerala FC as the reserve team head coach in November.

Vijayan’s homage

Former teammate and close friend Vijayan stated that Chapman was a once-in-a-generation talent. “Chapman is one of the greatest footballers that India has seen. Krishanu Dey was the best midfielder of his generation, and Chapman was one of the best from our generation,” Vijayan said.

“Carlton was a great midfielder. I am probably the one who played the most with him as a striker. I played with him at JCT and FC Kochin. We won a lot — Durand Cup, Federation Cup, etc — together. He was a brilliant player; selfless on the field. I was very close to his family. I used to stay at his Austin Town house in Bengaluru when I came over for India camps,” a heartbroken Vijayan said.

Condolences

Praful Patel, All India Football Federation president, said, “It’s sad to hear that Carlton Chapman is no more. His contribution to Indian football will never be forgotten. I share the grief.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/cv42qv/article32832373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CARLTONCHAPMANTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/former-india-football-captain-carton-chapman-passes-away/article32832374.ece

A mother and son died and two other persons suffered injuries, when boulders came rolling down the slope of a hill following heavy rain at Ganapathi Nagar under Gajuwaka Police Station limits here late Sunday night.

The boulders fell on the asbestos roof of the house, resulting in its collapse. The woman and her son were trapped under the rubble and died on the spot. The deceased were identified as Ramalakshmi, reported to be pregnant, and her three-year-old son Gnanesar. Two others of the same family suffered injuries in the mishap.

The bodies were removed from the rubble by the police and fire services personnel and shifted to the mortuary. The injured persons were shifted to a hospital for treatment.

It may be recalled that four persons were crushed to death, when a boulder fell on a house at Sanjeevaiah Nagar colony at Thatichetlapalem, also following heavy rain, in the city on December, 2015.

The Sunday-night rains uprooted trees and resulted in branches breaking off in some places in the city. Cable and telephone lines snapped and parked vehicles were damaged. In some areas like Sankara Matam, movement of traffic was disrupted when trees fell across the road. They were cleared by people from nearby areas and the GVMC staff.

Some of the low lying areas in the city were flooded due to the heavy rain but the water receded later. Water entered into the cellars of some apartments at Sheela Nagar. GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana said that the clogged drains were being cleared on a war-footing to ensure free flow of water.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/two-dead-and-two-injured-following-heavy-rains-in-visakhapatnam/article32832621.ece
379,2020/10/12,43 tribal youth to be trained in tailoring for two months,"Make use of the opportunity, SP tells them

As part of the community policing programme ‘Prerana’, 43 tribal youth, from various areas of Visakhapatnam Agency, will undergo a two-month training in tailoring at the Skill Development Institute in Vijayawada.

Tribal youth from Annavaram, GK Veedhi, Chintapalle, G Madugula, Seethampeta, Pedabayulu, Munchingputtu, Nathavaram and Koyyuru mandals, who have passed Class X and Intermediate, have been picked up for the training. On this occasion, the district police organised a programme here on Sunday.

Speaking to the youth before they left for Vijayawada, SP B. Krishna Rao appealed to them to make use of the opportunity and come up with flying colours. He told the youth that the acquisition of skills would not only help them to take care of themselves but also their family members.

The police arranged a special bus and a police escort to the youth. During the training course, the institute would offer free accommodation and food to the youth.

After completing the training programme, the youth would be given job opportunities in various companies in Visakhapatnam district, the police added.

Meanwhile, about 52 youth from various tribal areas of Visakhapatnam Agency had finished the tailoring course at the Skill Development Institute.

MLC P.V.N. Madhav has said that girls were facing a lot of problems within the four walls of their home as well as outside and the government should come out with stringent laws for their protection.

He released a poster, brought out by Bala Vikas Foundation (BVF), an NGO, working for the education and rights of children, on the occasion of International Girl Child Day on Sunday.

Commending the activities of the BVF, particularly those related to the safety and protection of girls, Mr. Madhav said that education of girls and women empowerment, apart from giving them equal opportunities were needed. BVF secretary Narava Prakasa Rao said that BVF has been observing this day every year for the last 10 years to sensitise girls on their rights and responsibilities. Education alone would help them to know their rights. The day was being observed on October 11 since 2011 to create awareness among the public on the rights of girls and women, he said.

District Child Rights Protection Officer Satyanarayana, Advocate G.B.V. Ravi Kumar and Dr. Nanduri Gopala Krishna participated.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State general secretary and MLC P.V.N. Madhav has held the TDP government in the past and the present YSR Congress Party government responsible for the undue delay in the establishment of the 500-bed ESI hospital, which was sanctioned by the Centre, for the city.

At a protest, organised by the BJP at Sheelanagar, where some land was allotted by the previous government, Mr. Madhav recalled that Mr. Naidu instead of allotting the land required for construction of the hospital, tried to get the project shifted to Vijayawada. Former Union Minister for Labour Bandaru Dattatreya had laid the foundation stone for construction of the hospital on April 11, 2016.

He said that the present YSR Congress Party government was also not allotting the additional land sought by the Centre, delaying the execution of the project.

BJP State vice president P. Vishnu Kumar Raju alleged that both the TDP government and the present YSR Congress Party government have failed to address the problems of workers. He said that the Centre was ready to sanction funds for the project.

BJP Parliamentary district president M. Raveendra explained that the ESI Hospital at Gandhigram in the city was started in January, 1972 on land taken on lease from the Visakhapatnam Port. The lease period had expired and the hospital building was in a dilapidated condition. The Centre had sanctioned a 500-bed ESI Hospital to Visakhapatnam and sought 10.25 acres of land. The TDP government had cheated the ESI members of north Andhra by not allotting the required land for construction of the hospital, he alleged and sought that the present government should allot the additional land without any further delay.

BJP State official representative K. Suhasini Anand, State executive members S.V.S. Prakash Reddy and P. Srinivas, City Mahila president V. Lalitha and party leaders Krishnam Raju, P. Indrasena Reddy, K. Narasinga Rao, Dilip Varma and K.V.S.N.

A protest was organised by the CITU at the Chittivalasa Jute Mills (CJM) quarters at Tagarapuvalasa, near here, on Sunday demanding reopening of mill, which is under lockout for a long time.

Addressing the workers, CITU State president Ch. Narasinga Rao said revival of the mill with ₹50 crore could provide direct employment to 5,000 workers and thousands of others indirectly. He wondered whether a single industry was established after the YSRCP came to power 16 months ago.

He alleged that both the management and the government were not bothered about the travails of the workers, who were thrown out of their jobs due to the lockout. He warned that the YSRCP government and Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao would have to pay a heavy price, if they fail to do justice to the workers.

TDP leaders Korada Rajababu and Ganta Nookaraju extended their support to the workers.

‘It’s All In Your Head, M’

By Manjiri Indurkar, Westland Publications

An unapologetic narration of the author's struggles with mental health, this is a story of strength and resilience and the ultimate potion of self-care and acceptance. It delves into a life plagued with various mental illnesses brought on by the sexual abuse she suffered as a child.

In her twenties, when Manjiri Indurkar started living away from home she began to suspect that all wasn’t well with her. She grew up with a loving and supportive family, but grappled with the trauma of the past. The books speaks of how she learnt to lead a balanced life.

‘Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond’

By Sonia Shah, Harper Collins India

Where do pandemics come from? How do microbes turn into deadly pathogens? What does our future hold in store? Science journalist, Sonia Shah explores these and many more questions in this timely and extensively researched book. Her epidemiological reportage refers to over 300 infectious diseases that have either emerged or re-emerged over the past 50 years. Though alarm bells had been sounded, scientists could not foresee which pathogen (Ebola, avian flu,the drug-resistant superbug, or the novel Coronavirus) would cause the next global outbreak.

Shah emphasises on the need to understand and unravel the stories of pandemics to be in a state of preparedness in future. She builds her script delving into science and politics, interweaving history, first-hand reporting, and personal narrative to explore the origins.

She believes there's much we can do to prevent pandemics from happening in the first place.

‘The Invention of Surgery’

By Dr David Schneider, Hachette India

The biography of surgery through centuries, from the instinctive practice of the ancient Greek physicians to the implant revolution and robotic surgeries of the 21st century comes from Dr Schneider, a leading shoulder and elbow replacement surgeon with decades of experience of holding the scalpel. He talks of surgery as a practice in progress that transforms with new technologies, the evolution of medical education and the development of medicines.

The author explains the dramatic progress by linking historical figures with pioneering scientists who first understood what causes disease, how organs become infected and how surgery intercedes in peoples' lives.

‘Between Life and Death: From Despair to Hope’

By Dr Kashyap Patel, PenguinBooks

An oncologist of two decades in the US, Dr Kashyap Patel sensitively weaves together true stories of hope and fear in order for us to have a deep understanding of the anxieties that those with terminal illness face.

The protagonist is Harry, who, after a life full of adventure, is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He leans on the doctor while undergoing the process of death. His doubts are addressed caringly through the stories of other patients treated by Dr Patel. He is eventually prepared to exit the world gracefully.

‘Sit Your Self Down: A Novice's Journey into the Heart of Vipassana’

ByGayatri Jayaraman, Hachette India

When the author embarked on a 10-day vipassana course in the Himalayas, she had no inkling to how it would transform her. Her inward journey during the programme made her want to share her experience, so others considering it could get a clearer understanding of what it entails.

The former journalist-turned counsellor gives a witty account of self-exploration with humility and honesty. Through her own journey, where she puts the chaotic world behind, along with mobile phone and dinner (!), she advocates for silence that often gives us a clear perspective and a revelation of inner strength.

‘The Food Mood Connection’

By Dr.Uma Naidoo, Hatchette India

Most people tweak their diets for weight loss, fitness, cardiac health and longevity. This book tells us how what we eat affects our brains more than our bodies. For instance, how Vitamin C and antioxidants such as flavonoids in blueberries help the body cope with the after-effects of trauma. Or, how Vitamin D intake helps in the treatment of anxiety.

Psychiatrist and nutrition specialist, Dr.Uma Naidoo draws on research to explain the connection between the food we eat and our varying moods. Quoting several studies on the profound impact of diet on mental health: conditions from ADHD to depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, OCD and dementia, Dr.Naidoo shows how a healthy diet can help treat and prevent a wide range of psychological and cognitive issues.",,https://www.thehindu.com/books/lxykdo/article32832813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Books-to-read-a,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-that-focus-on-the-mind-and-the-body/article32832814.ece
387,2020/10/12,Two school students from Kerala design motorbikes that look like bicycles,"Harshad TH and Sumith Sunil have made the bikes from scrap

Harshad TH and Sumith Sunil beat the lockdown blues by designing vehicles from scrap. These school students from Kerala modified their bicyles with engines. Although Harshad lives at Palluruthy in Ernakulam district and Sumith near Vaikom in Kottayam district, they came up with the designs in the gap of a few months. Their motorbikes, which look more or less the same, became the talk of the town after the videos of the vehicles were posted on social media.

Harshad is a class 10 student while Sumith is in class 12. While Harshad, the first one to make the bike, sourced scrap from his father TG Hashim’s automobile workshop, Sumith collected them from various scrap dealers. Among the scrap were engine, tyres, chain, socket, handles, suspension, speedometer and the like.

They both spent nearly ₹10,000. “I enjoy spending time in my father’s workshop. The lockdown gave me enough time to work on the design,” says Harshad, adding that the engine was from his valyuppa’s (grandfather) vehicle.

The bikes have iron pipes welded together to form the frame, with one of the pipes used as petrol tank. The inspiration for the design was the Mofa (mini moped) in which the chassis itself is the petrol tank, Harshad points out. While he took the help of a relative to weld the pipes, Sumith did most of it on his own. “It was extremely difficult and by evening my eyes started hurting,” says Sumith, known as Ambili in his neighbourhood. The 17-year-old adds that it was exciting to work with the scrap. “For example, the silencer was made from the spray paint tin. Since a large speedometer would have looked odd, I went for the one used in a petrol autorickshaw. My friend, Arjun, has been of great help,” says Sumith.

Harshad’s bike’s tank can hold just over one litre of petrol and Sumith’s two litres. They claim to get mileage between 40-50 km per litre. However, they cannot use their bikes on the roads now as they have to obtain relevant certificates.

Two years ago, Sumith had given a makeover to his bicycle to make it look like a motorcycle. Unfortunately it got damaged in the flood. “During the lockdown, I had initially planned to make a car. But that had to be dropped since the road to my house isn’t wide enough to drive a four-wheeler and also it was an expensive affair,” he says.

He can’t thank enough his parents, Sunil Kumar, an autorickshaw driver, mother Sinimol KC and elder brother, Sujith Sunil, who have always encouraged him. Before they got electricity connection in their new house, Sumith got a new battery to light LED bulbs in every room. “I charged it in my father’s autorickshaw,” he adds. He has exhibited his penchant for electronic devices in the rickshaw. It now has a reverse camera, besides accessories such as a music system and lights. “There is a calling bell in the passenger cabin. Now that a separator sheet is mandatory in all rickshaws, sometimes the driver can’t hear what passengers tell him. Now they can ring the bell when they reach their destination,” Sumith says.

Meanwhile, Harshad has already come up with his next invention — a boat made of PVC pipes, thermocol and wooden pieces. “Family and neighbours pitched in with funds. I made an oar and rowed it across the nearby lake. I hope to fix a motor, provided I get the money to buy one,” Harshad says.

Looks like both the designers are set on going places with their designs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/kqrtbg/article32835329.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12tvmharshad,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/two-school-students-from-kerala-make-motorbikes-that-look-like-bicycles/article32835332.ece
388,2020/10/12,Raghu Dixit and Samyukta Hornad sing to propagate pet adoption,"The recently released video features 100 photographs of people and their pets from all over the country

Raghu Dixit’s latest album, Tsunami, celebrates love. Released in Hindi and Kannada, the first song in the seven-track album is dedicated to the love shared between humans and their pets. Raghu has composed, sung, recorded and produced the duet which also features actor Samyukta Hornad. The video, which has images of people from all over the country with their pets, was officially launched on YouTube on October 6.

“It is aimed at encouraging pet adoption,” says Raghu over the phone from his home in Malleshwaram in Bengaluru. “Samyukta is an animal activist. She has a page on Instagram called GundaGiri, dedicated to her pet, Gunda, who died seven years ago. While she dedicates this song to Gunda, I dedicate it to my pet Thunti, who left me in January this year. When we adopt pets, we give them a second chance at life and love. These beautiful souls will surely fill all our lives with unconditional and uncompromising love.”

The folk singer says his life changed when Thunti came into it. “I got her from the animal shelter, Lets Live Together, two years ago. I believe there was a purpose behind Thunti’s entry into my life. She came at a time when I didn’t want to live any more. I was depressed. She taught me how simple it is to be happy, to forgive, how not to not carry a baggage, how to live in the moment, that nothing else matters and all we need is an endless tsunami of love!”

Raghu says Samyukta has a great voice. “With training she can be a voice to reckon with in the music world.”

It was Samyukta’s idea to collect photographs of people with their pets, for the video, Raghu says. Of the 1,500 photographs they received, they managed to accommodate 100 in the video. The singer also credits his filmmaker-friend Samuel Adams for shooting at Charlie’s Animal Rescue Centre in Bengaluru. The Hindi lyrics have been written by Neeraj Rajawat and Raghavendra V Kamath has written the Kannada lyrics. Raghu is currently busy composing music for Kannada films Ninna Sanihakke and Orchestra.

Perfect fit

Samyukta Hornad who started her film career with the Kannada film Lifeu Ishtene is also a singer. Though she has never ever sung in public she says at home she is forever singing with her mother and grandmother.

Being an animal activist, who passionately advocates animal adoption she seemed to be perfect choice for Raghu Dixit’s video. “When Raghu asked me to sing for Tsunami, I was apprehensive as I have had no training in singing at all,” she says. “When we met for the project, Raghu was kind enough to train me. I went through a few days of vocal training and then the song was recorded.”

She says she was overwhelmed with the response from pet lovers across the country. “Each person had to write two lines about their pets and send it with their pictures. We received images and stories featuring roosters, dogs, cows, ducks and parrots.”

Samyukta is happy that she got to explore her musical side with this project. On the film front she is looking forward to the release of the Tamil film Red Rum and the Kannada film Arishadvarga.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/tf1ekl/article32834981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/e97884a7-8855-4730-b529-14ef2ae1d239,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/raghu-dixit-and-samyukta-hornad-sing-to-propagate-pet-adoption/article32834982.ece
389,2020/10/12,How a simple act of kindness restores faith in humanity,"Thanks to a vigilant cyclist in Mumbai, a lighting store owner found his wallet

Last Saturday in Mumbai, Chetan Patel was out at 5:30 in the morning on his motorbike, zipping across from Andheri to Santa Cruz, approximately 7 kilometres away. “My friend was leaving town, and didn’t have money. The ATM near his place wasn’t working,” says the 25-year-old, who is part of a family that runs a lighting store in the city.

He lost his balance on a speed breaker, but regained it quickly and was on his way to his friend’s. There, he realised he had lost his wallet, and proceeded to cancel his debit card.

Behind him was a cyclist, Vijay Malhotra, who saw Chetan lose balance and also saw something drop. He came up from behind, picked up the wallet, and tried to chase Chetan, but was not able to catch up.

“After finishing my ride, I went home and tried to find his contact in his wallet,” says Vijay, who found the money and a driver’s license, besides the card in the wallet. “I searched for him on Facebook as per his name on the driving license, but could not find him.” He called a friend who suggested they contact the bank, where he himself had an account.

The HDFC relationship manager said he could not divulge customer details, but was happy to patch a call through. Once that was done, Chetan had his wallet back the same day, with about ₹6,000, his license and card.

“He’s the best guy ever,” says Chetan, of Vijay, who started Pedal and Tring Tring, a blog about cycling, fitness and the outdoors. He himself had lost a laptop last month, when he stepped out to feed the birds in front of his house, and someone entered and took it away. “Having suffered a loss myself, I could understand the pain of losing something valuable,” he says. He advocates for cyclists, who he says are always alert and aware of their surroundings.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/qljye4/article32831688.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Vijay-on-right,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/a-wallet-lost-and-found-by-a-cyclist/article32831689.ece
390,2020/10/12,Explained: FELUDA paper strip test for coronavirus,"It uses CRISPR-Cas technology for the detection of genes specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday that the rollout of the FELUDA paper strip test for coronavirus is expected in the next few weeks.

He said that tests on over 2000 patients during the trials at the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) and in private labs, showed that the test had 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity.

What is FELUDA?

FELUDA is an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor-Limited Uniform Detection Assay. It uses CRISPR-Cas technology for the detection of genes specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Also read: What is genome editing

In this method, a protein called FnCas9 and a guide RNA(gRNA) which helps in recognising the viral genes is used.

If the patient sample has the viral gene, this gRNA-FnCas9 complex binds to the gene and using a paper strip this binding can be visualised.

How is the test done?

The nasopharyngeal swab is collected

RNA is extracted

A single step RT-PCR is done

The FELUDA mix is prepared by incubating the dead FnCas9 protein, guide RNA and the amplified viral DNA

The dip stick is immersed in the FELUDA mix

Gold nanoparticle on the strip bind to the FELUDA complex

A protein called Streptavidin on the test line captures this gold nanoparticle bound-FELUDA complex

Unbound gold particles are captured on the control line

Colour develops on the test line and/or control line. One line indicates negative and two lines mean positive.

The test takes about one to two minutes

Is it better than RT-PCR?

RT- PCR equipment and reagents are costly and a technical expertise is needed.

Dr. Debojyoti Chakraborty, Senior Scientist at CSIR-IGIB writes on his webpage that: “With FELUDA, the need for technical expertise is minimal and no requirement of expensive equipment, making it an easy to perform, point of care test. It thus saves space, time and money.” He is one of the authors of the pre-print shared on bioRxiv that describes the development of FELUDA.

Can I test myself at home?

“We are in the process of developing a Do-it-yourself/at-home detection kit, but at the moment the answer is no and you will have to visit your doctor or testing center to get yourself tested,” Dr. Chakraborty writes on his webpage.

Who is making the FELUDA test kits?

In May, CSIR IGIB and TATA Sons signed an MoU for licensing the knowhow related to development of the kit.

“This innovative ‘Feluda’ test uses cutting-edge CRISPR technology for detection of the genomic sequence of the novel coronavirus. It uses a test protocol that is simple to administer and easy to interpret, enabling results to be made available to the medical fraternity in relatively lesser time as compared to other test protocols,” says Banmali Agrawala, president, Infrastructure and Defence and Aerospace, Tata Sons in a release.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/43rjg5/article32835459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/feluda,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/explained-feluda-paper-strip-test-for-coronavirus/article32835460.ece
391,2020/10/12,"In controlled environment, novel coronavirus can last 28 days on glass, currency: study","By comparison, Influenza A virus has been found to survive on surfaces for 17 days.

In a very controlled environment the novel coronavirus can survive on banknotes, glass and stainless steel for up to 28 days, much longer than the flu virus, Australian researchers said on Monday, highlighting the need for cleaning and handwashing to combat the virus.

Findings from the study done by Australia's national science agency, CSIRO, was published in Virology Journal.

CSIRO researchers found that at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) the SARS-COV-2 virus remained infectious for 28 days on smooth surfaces such as plastic banknotes and glass found on mobile phone screens. By comparison, Influenza A virus has been found to survive on surfaces for 17 days.

“It really reinforces the importance of washing hands and sanitising where possible and certainly wiping down surfaces that may be in contact with the virus,” said the study's lead researcher Shane Riddell.

Also read: Widespread use of sanitisers, soaps can worsen antimicrobial resistance: Experts

The study involved drying virus in an artificial mucus on a range of surfaces at concentrations similar to samples from COVID-19 patients and then recovering the virus over a month.

Experiments done at 20, 30 and 40 degrees C showed the virus survived longer at cooler temperatures, longer on smooth surfaces than on complex surfaces such as cotton, and longer on paper banknotes than on plastic banknotes.
