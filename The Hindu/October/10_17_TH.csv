0,2020/10/17,Phone photo memory,"I don’t care for any phone details because what is phone? Phone means what?

Respected Madam/ Sir,

For three years, I am having same mobile phone. Same phone. It is Samsung phone. What is the memory? I don’t know. What is the processor? I don’t care. What is the operating theatre? Mannangkatti.

In office of your esteemed newspaper, maybe you people are thinking, oh my god we thought Mr. Mathrubootham is retired person but with lot of youth type outlooks. But whether actually he is Jambuvan period type who is still saying video tape and eight annas and watching Doordarshan?

Don’t speak like muttaals.

I don’t care for any phone details because what is phone? Phone means what? You put phone call, you put WhatsApp, put some videos, maybe call taxi. Finished. For that and all why I need biodata and horoscope and Aadhaar card of phone?

Total time waste. But some people will talk about phone as if marriage proposal. Marriage proposal even they will not do so much research. Memory is good but height is low. Boy’s height good but he has taken 11 years to do graduation. Very good family and very good house and very good neighbourhood but where is the megapixel?

Two months ago, Mrs. M bought one new mobile phone. And she did research for one day? Wrong. Two days? Wrong. One week? Wrong wrong. One month? Nonstop wrong. Madam/ Sir, she did research for full two months. I said, Kamalam, you are buying phone or once more doing M.Sc. in Zoology? She said, you please go and sit and play out-of-fashion games on your phone, my new phone is waterproof. I said, oh amazing, now you can watch Madhavan videos during bath also. She quietly looked at me and said: Correct. Any problem?

Why I am putting phone speech? This morning my son who is working from home came to me and said, Appa, please install one new app on phone. My company is developing. I said, ok, no problem. What app? He said, it is amazing new app for ordering food from nearby restaurants. I said, congratulations kanna, you have come up with brand new idea first time in India, please check if it is new idea in whole world.

He said, hahaha Appa, so funny. Alistair Maclean will write same move 35 times and you will read nonstop. But my app is problem-aa? In India no one will give money for new app. Originality and all for U.S. only. Please quietly give your phone.

Ten minutes later he said Appa, memory is finished. Please delete some items. I said, oh my god, please give me the funny intolerable headache.

Madam/ Sir, that is when unbearable sentiments are coming into the heart. I opened Google Photos and app is saying look at this photo from last year, from five years back, whether you have seen this photo, this one, what about this? Like that, like that.

And who is in these photos? Madam/ Sir, some old friends who are no more. Rajan from college. Thomas J.J. who was colleague in Ujjain branch. Some photos from get-together in Yercaud, 2012. Suddenly I am seeing photos and memories are coming like anything. For one hour I sat and looked at photos and photos.

Then I called Mrs. M. I said Kamalam, I want to buy new phone. This one memory is finished. I want more memory. She said why, you’re thinking of Suhasini videos? I said no, no, Kamalam, I want to keep photos safely forever. She said, no problem, old man. I will find one new phone. Give me two months.

Now I am waiting and taking care of old phone carefully.

Yours in reminiscences,

Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus' co-founder Carl Pei confirmed on Friday that he is leaving the company he helped build.

“After nearly 7 years at OnePlus, I’ve made the difficult decision to say goodbye.” Pei said in a blog post.

During his tenure, OnePlus has launched several flagships, starting with the OnePlus One in 2014 to the most recent OnePlus 8T.

The company's first phone was dubbed a ""flagship killer"" as it offered features and specifications on par with other flagships.

“The world didn’t need another smartphone brand in 2013. But we saw ways of doing things better and dreamt of shaking things up,” Pei noted. “Better products. Built hand in hand with our users. At more reasonable prices,” he added.

In July, the company introduced its first mid-range smartphone OnePlus Nord, developed under Pei’s guidance. OnePlus had briefly experimented with OnePlus X, in 2015, however, Nord was specifically designed to compete in the mid-range segment.

OnePlus has consistently offered products with premium build quality, high-end specifications at competitive prices. This has helped the company grow as a global brand with significant market share in major smartphone markets such as India.

OnePlus regained its top position in the Indian premium smartphone market with 29% share in Q2 2020, according to a report by research firm Counterpoint

Pei was 24 when OnePlus started. He says, “It’s where I spent most of my 20s, and also where I grew up.”

“I’m looking forward to taking some time off to decompress and catch up with my family and friends. And then follow my heart on to what’s next,” Pei adds.

According to a report by TechCrunch, Pei is reportedly starting a new venture, and is in talks with investors.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/6pnnf5/article32880981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/oneplus,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/oneplus-co-founder-carl-pei-leaves-the-company-after-7-years/article32881117.ece

7,2020/10/17,"U.K., EU to discuss ‘structure’ of Brexit talks","Britain had earlier threatened to walk away unless there was a major shift in Brussels’ approach

European and British negotiators will be in touch Monday to discuss the “structure” of post-Brexit trade talks, despite London’s threat on Friday to walk away unless there was a major shift in Brussels’ approach.

An EU spokesman tweeted that chief negotiator Michel Barnier held video talks with his British counterpart David Frost on Friday after the results of European summit provoked an angry response in London.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was no point in holding any more talks without a dramatic softening of the EU’s position, bringing a step closer the possibility that the planned divorce at the end of the year will end acrimoniously.

“As far as we’re concerned the trade talks are over,” Mr. Johnson’s official spokesman told reporters after an EU Summit on Thursday proposed a fresh round of talks next week in London, while demanding Britain give ground on key stumbling blocks.

Mr. Johnson, accusing the bloc of failing “to negotiate seriously”, said the summit outcome had ruled out a comprehensive, Canada-style free trade agreement between the EU and Britain. “They want the continued ability to control our legislative freedom, our fisheries, in a way that is obviously unacceptable to an independent country,” he said.

“And so with high hearts and complete confidence, we will prepare to embrace the alternative,” Mr. Johnson said, adding Britain should “get ready” to operate on stripped-down World Trade Organization rules from January.

8,2020/10/17,Trump appeals to GOP base as polls slide,"He says Democratic candidate Biden will bring ‘communism and a flood of criminal immigrants’

President Donald Trump fought on Friday to recover from sinking election polls by campaigning with a hardline pitch to America’s right wing, claiming at rallies in Florida and Georgia that his Democratic opponent Joe Biden would deliver communism and a “flood” of criminal immigrants.

While Mr. Trump put on a brave face, the fact that he was fighting for the two southern States he won four years ago illustrated how much ground he has to make up against Mr. Biden in the 18 days left until the election.

With his polls sliding and U.S. COVID-19 infections spiking, Mr. Trump is focusing entirely on his core Republican base, in hopes that highly energised supporters will turn out in huge numbers.

In Ocala, Florida, the coronavirus was an afterthought.

Instead, Mr. Trump tossed the large, loudly cheering crowd red meat on immigration, race, and his conspiracy theory that Mr. Biden is steeped in corruption.

Spicing his stump speech with lurid exaggerations, Mr. Trump claimed that the “Biden family is a criminal enterprise.”

He said Democrats “have nothing but disdain for your values” and “want to turn America into a communist country” — a reprise of his successful 2016 message tapping into white, working-class resentment.

“It’s time we sent a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites,” he told the cheering crowd in Macon, Georgia on Friday night.

Mr. Trump also dived into racially charged comments on Latin American migrants, saying Democrats will “flood your communities with illegal aliens, drugs, crime.”

And he lashed out at one of his most outspoken critics, the Somali-American Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar, saying “she hates our country” and “comes from a place that doesn’t even have a government.”

Mr. Trump had still more venom for journalists, whom he called “the enemy of the people.”

And he seemed to acknowledge things might not go his way in the end.

“Running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics puts pressure on me. Could you imagine if I lose?,” Mr. Trump mused.

“What am I gonna do?,” he continued. “I’m not gonna feel so good. Maybe I’ll have to leave the country. I don’t know.”

Biden stays focused

Mr. Biden, meanwhile, was campaigning in Michigan, where he ripped into Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus — the strongest issue of his campaign. “He keeps telling us that this virus is going to disappear like a miracle,” Mr. Biden said in Southfield.

“My lord! It’s not disappearing, in fact it’s on the rise again, it’s getting worse, as predicted,” Mr. Biden said.

He also homed in on another area where Mr. Trump has run into regular controversy — his often lacklustre responses when asked to condemn White supremacists. He said Mr. Trump’s comments were a “dog whistle” to such groups.

“We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction and yes, truth over lies.”

However, Mr. Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon sounded a note of caution for Democrats, saying national polls especially were misleading.

“We are not ahead by double digits,” she said. “Those are inflated national public polling numbers.”

Mr. Biden will be getting help from Democratic superstar Barack Obama on Wednesday next week when the former president, who had Biden as his vice president, campaigns in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Republicans raise alarm

As the polling clouds darken for Mr. Trump, prominent members of his own Republican party — including Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas — are sounding the alarm.

Mr. Sasse, in a telephone call with constituents this week obtained by The Washington Examiner, said a defeat for Mr. Trump looks “likely” and Republicans may also lose the Senate.

Mr. Sasse also had harsh words for Mr. Trump, saying he is “TV-obsessed,” “narcissistic” and allowed his family to treat “the presidency like a business opportunity.”

But Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Republican ally for Mr. Trump, told AFP that voters were starting to weigh the pros and cons of the two parties, rather than focusing on Mr. Trump’s bruising personality.

“I think it’s getting better for us by the day,” he said.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden are to hold a final debate next Thursday. They had been scheduled to hold one this Thursday but Mr. Trump backed out after it was changed to a virtual debate following his COVID-19 diagnosis. The candidates held rival townhall instead.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8s6m48/article32883066.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-USA-ELECTIONTRUMP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-appeals-to-gop-base-as-polls-slide/article32883067.ece

Every inch of the hall, including its ceiling and floor, are covered with screens, displaying images and numbers showcasing the all-pervasive reach of Tencent, and in particular of its WeChat ecosystem that powers China today, offering everything from social media messaging and mobile payments to e-government services. Today, WeChat is also serving as a platform for the official health code service, a tracing app that has played a key role in China’s controlling of the COVID-19 pandemic at home, at least for now.

If the lab coats, sliding doors and flashing lights at Tencent HQ all seem very Star Trek, there is a reason for the elaborate messaging. It is aimed at showing the company’s role in China’s evolution from the world’s workshop to a tech power. And it is no accident that Tencent is headquartered in Shenzhen, a city that has, for four decades, been at the cusp of driving change in China. On October 14, China marked the 40th anniversary of the setting up of its first Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Shenzhen, a key step in China’s economic reforms and opening up process that would also transform a provincial backwater, whose only claim to fame then was serving as the last stop on the mainland on the Canton (Guangzhou)-Kowloon rail, before it entered then British-controlled Hong Kong.

In 1978, at the start of the reforms process, China’s GDP was $149 billion, not much greater than India’a $140 billion. Its GDP per capita of $156 was less than India’s $203. Fast-forward four decades, and it is now five-times India’s, while the city of Shenzhen alone has a $400 billion GDP, which overtook Hong Kong’s in 2018 and is about the same as Maharashtra’s, India’s biggest state economy.

Experimentation has been key to Shenzhen’s success, and it is still the mantra that drives its firms, big and small. Up the road from Tencent on Binhai Boulevard is the company Royole, a seven-year-old Shenzhen start-up that manufactures foldable electronic displays. “Innovation is at the heart of the Shenzhen spirit,” explained Thalia Cheng, a manager at one of its Shenzhen showrooms, in a conversation last November, as she outlined the company’s next big plan — weaving in electronic displays on clothes and handbags (Louis Vuitton is one of their customers).

In transition

Ms. Cheng, and many in Shenzhen, see the city’s access to a large pool of trained and talented labour as one reason behind its rise, both 40 years ago and today, when it is looking to transition from workshop to innovator. If it was the millions of rural workers who descended on this city in the 1980s seeking jobs that offered a way out of rural poverty, today, it is university graduates seeking a fortune in China’s tech sector.

But 40 years on, as they embark on their Shenzhen adventures, a remarkably different world awaits them. If the success story of the world’s workshop coincided with the start of the era of globalisation, China’s tech giants are finding a much more frosty reception today, with much of the world, including India, now reassessing how it wants to do business with China Inc. No surprise that President Xi Jinping, speaking in Shenzhen on the October 14 anniversary, warned of a turbulent world and unprecedented global challenges.

Yet, the changes abroad are, in a sense, reacting to changes within China too. If decentralisation and a retreat of the party-state paved the way for reforms and experimentation in the 1980s, today, the Communist Party is seeking to exert ever greater sway over how even private tech companies are run (all of which, incidentally, are mandated to have internal Party units).

This strange dichotomy was on display outside the Shenzhen Stock Exchange one November morning, a building known for the distinctive statue of two giant charging bulls that stand at its entrance, a symbol of the city — and the country — embracing the market. And just across the square, an electronic screen flashed a banner in bright red, showing a waving flag of the Party and a slogan urging everyone to abide by the values of Mr. Xi’s signature slogan, called ‘Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a new era’. Only in Shenzhen.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/l9dne/article32882853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Shenzhen-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/shenzhen-chinas-city-of-change/article32882854.ece
10,2020/10/17,UNHRC | A work-in-progress campaign for rights,"The UN agency is leading the global fight for human rights amid external challenges and internal contradictions

On October 13, elections were held for the cohort of member nations who will serve for the next three years (2021-23) in the UN Human Rights Council. Among the five countries that were vying for membership from the Asia-Pacific region, four — Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Nepal and China — made it, while Saudi Arabia lost out.

The UNHRC has 47 members serving at any time with elections held to fill up seats every year, based on allocations to regions across the world to ensure geographical representation. Along with the aforementioned countries, the others who booked a seat in the council included Russia and Ukraine from Eastern Europe; France and the U.K. from Western Europe and other states; Ivory Coast, Gabon, Malawi and Senegal from Africa; and Bolivia, Cuba and Mexico from the Latin American and Caribbean States. Countries are disallowed from occupying a seat for more than two consecutive terms.

The election to the Asia Pacific cohort this year was eventful. Saudi Arabia which had controversially earned a representation twice (2014-16, followed by 2017-2019) despite a known reputation for several human rights violations, could not secure a seat this time. In the secret ballot conducted in the 193-member UN General Assembly, Saudi Arabia could manage only 90 votes in comparison to Pakistan (169), Uzbekistan (164), Nepal (150) and China (139). For a nation with immense clout in West Asia, the inability to secure a seat despite the regime’s efforts to refurbish its image could be chalked up to the fallout of the assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the detention of several women rights’ activists, among others.

Yet, despite the exclusion of Saudi Arabia, the record of some other member-states such as China and Russia in the council has also not lived up to the aims and mission of the UNHRC, which has led to critics questioning its relevance. Powerful countries such as the U.S. have refused to participate in the Council, with the Trump administration taking the country out of the Council in 2018, years after it was reinstated under President Barack Obama.

Mission

The UNHRC, which was reconstituted from its predecessor organisation, the UN Commission on Human Rights, is a United Nations body whose mission is to promote and protect human rights across the world. The council is seen as a central structure in the global human rights architecture, a political body with representatives drawn from the General Assembly.

Apart from the council, the UN has also set up a number of treaty-based organisations to monitor compliance with human rights standards and international human rights treaties such as the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

The UNHRC, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, has two key functions — the council passes non-binding resolutions on human rights issues through a periodic review of all 193 UN member states called the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), besides overseeing expert investigation of violations in specific countries (Special Procedures).

Human rights breaches that are investigated by the UNHRC across UN member states relate to themes such as freedom of association and assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of belief and religion, women’s rights, LGBT rights and the rights of racial and ethnic minorities. However, what makes the Council’s composition problematic is that several of its members run afoul of its proclaimed aims (for example, the one-party systems of China and Cuba that have a controversial record on freedom of expression or the anti-gay policies of Russia).

Structure

At one level, the UNHRC’s structure — drawing a group of nations from the General Assembly through rotation and election via a “one state, one vote” principle — has allowed the organisation to be fairly representative of the General Assembly without special privileges for the more developed Western countries, as is the case with other multilateral institutions such as the IMF or the World Bank.

The UNHRC replaced the Human Rights Commission in 2006 after a vast majority of the UN member States endorsed the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan’s proposal to create a new institution that would overcome the “credibility deficit” of the previous organisation. The General Assembly Resolution 60/251 helped establish the Council, whose detailed workings were negotiated subsequently.

The mechanism of Universal Periodic Review (UPR) was incorporated into the functioning to give teeth to the organisation. The UPR, which has a national report from the state under review plus a compilation of UN information prepared by the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights, also allows for a summary of information from civil society actors.

Countries such as Israel, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Myanmar, Sudan, Cambodia, Belarus, Burundi and Eritrea have been investigated and strongly condemned by the UNHRC for violating various human rights. Sri Lanka, for example, had, in a co-sponsored resolution in 2015, provided commitments to the council to promote reconciliation, accountability and human rights, following the end of the civil war in 2009. The Gotabaya Rajapaksa-led government withdrew the country from those commitments earlier this year.

In a unanimously passed resolution that was sponsored by African states, the UNHRC in June 2020, ordered a report on “systematic racism” against people of African descent following the murder of the African-American George Floyd in the U.S. India has not been spared from scrutiny either. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, had earlier this year expressed concern over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the clampdown in Kashmir, besides the “inter-communal attacks” in Delhi in February. Later, Ms. Bachelet had welcomed the release of political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir, but expressed concern over the communications restrictions as part of “Global Human Rights update” at the start of the 45th session of the UNHRC in September 2020.

While the U.S. has stayed away from the council, keeping in line with the isolationist impulse of the Trump administration, other Western countries have actively participated in the UNHRC despite their misgivings about countries with a blemished rights record. There has always been an inherent tension between countries from the West that espouse an individualist notion of human rights that lays emphasis on political and civic rights and those from the developing world who have laid greater emphasis on socio-economic and cultural rights (such as Cuba). Between these “extremities”, there are other rising powers such as Brazil and India who have committed to hold states to account for human rights issues.

The unique arrangement of representation, review and collaboration (with civil society groups over and above nation-states) has certainly improved the functioning of the UNHRC in comparison with its predecessor Commission.

Studies have shown that, in terms of “human rights scores” — an overall evaluation of human rights records of countries as part of the grouping — the UNHCR’s scores have steadily increased (at least till 2016, according to one study) and have been much higher than that of the Commission. The gap between the scores for the countries within the UNHCR and for the rest in the UNGA has also narrowed down over time, indicating that the membership included more countries with better human rights records”. But the challenges remain high. The UNHCR is still a work in progress.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/n9jm9s/article32882825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UNHRCart,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/unhrc-a-work-in-progress-campaign-for-rights/article32882826.ece
11,2020/10/17,The Hindu Explains | How QAnon went from a bizarre conspiracy theory to an election talking point,"QAnon is an elaborate right-wing conspiracy theory that claims thousands of ""deep state operatives"" are involved in the racket, for which they will be arrested and punished in an event believers call “The Storm.”

In a recent televised townhall, U.S. President Donald Trump was asked if he denounced the right-wing conspiracy theory QAnon, which claims that Democrats are part of a satan-worshipping pedophile ring, and that Mr. Trump is the “savior” from this. He refused to do that, and instead praised the conspiracy theorists's fight against pedophilia.

Experts who research extremist groups and political violence have said that Mr. Trump's statement, the latest of many on a similar vein, is likely to legitimise QAnon supporters and encourage the spread of the convoluted conspiracy theory that is starting to spill out of the online space.

What is QAnon?

QAnon is an elaborate right-wing conspiracy theory that believes a wide range of people – Democratic party leaders, Hollywood elites, U.S. state government employees – to be a part of a global satan-worshipping, child sex trafficking group. It claims that thousands of ""deep state operatives"" are involved in the racket, for which they will be arrested and punished in an event believers call “The Storm.” Frequently mentioned names include 2016 U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, and billionaire George Soros, among others.

Also read | Facebook bans all QAnon groups as dangerous amid surging misinformation

QAnon is a relatively new conspiracy. It can be traced to an anonymous post on imageboard website 4chan in October 2017. A user who went by the name ‘Q’ posted a series of cryptic messages “exposing” the establishment, suggesting that an apocalyptic shake-up is in order against the Democrats. The posts, peppered with white nationalist slogans and pro-Trump messaging, found a dedicated audience. The user was assumed to be a high-level intelligence official with Q-level clearance, which is required to access Top Secret information in the U.S. government.

The clues or “crumbs” are unsubstantiated and does not stand up to scrutiny. However, on one instance, Q posted that Mr. Trump would tweet a phrase minutes before the President did, which followers took as an confirmation of Q’s legitimacy. Within months, it was picked up by conservative YouTubers and mediapersons, expanding its reach across social media platforms.

Does anyone take this seriously?

Many do. The malleable nature of the claims have led to it developing many offshoots with numerous, often contradictory, conclusions. It has trickled down from conspiracy theorists to YouTubers and Instagram influencers – an article in The Atlantic notes that many followers are drawn in by concerns around the child trafficking racket, a ‘safe’, non-partisan issue, and end up as conduits for the perpetuation of the conspiracy theory.

Social media giants like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have pledged to place curbs on promoting QAnon content recently. Facebook said that it will remove pages, groups and Instagram accounts representing the theory. Instagram also placed restrictions that limit visibility of posts tagged with QAnon-related hashtags. Twitter said that it will be taking off nearly 7,000 QAnon accounts, and announced intention to stop promoting related content. YouTube too has announced stricter enforcement of policies to limit the spread of conspiracy theories, and said it has removed numerous QAnon-videos and channels under its existing policies.

However, the shape-shifting nature of conspiracy theories has posed a unique challenge. As misinformation surged and Facebook escalated the crackdown on related content, the company said that some groups have been using coded language to work around this, for example referring to Q as “cue”. They also integrate themselves into groups working on child safety or anti-trafficking. “QAnon messaging changes very quickly and we see networks of supporters build an audience with one message and then quickly pivot to another,” Facebook said in a blogpost.

Real-life impact

The FBI, in 2019, classed QAnon as a potential source of domestic terrorism. The group has been linked to acts of real-world violence, including alleged kidnapping attempts, and the killing of a member of the Gambino crime family in the United States.

Group members have also been flagged for sharing content that celebrates violence, promotes anti-semitism, and spreading false information about U.S. voting, COVID-19, and the West Coast wildfires. It has also found takers in countries other than the U.S., including Germany and parts of Europe.

Impact on U.S. politics

In a report, media watchdog Media Matters for America reported that President Trump has amplified Twitter accounts promoting QAnon at least 258 times as of October 15. QAnon supporters have been a visible part of Trump rallies in the past few months. The President, meanwhile, has repeatedly refused to denounce the conspiracy theory, saying “I don’t know that [it is false] and neither do you.”

QAnon has found some takers in the Republican party as well. While Vice President Mike Pence has dismissed the theory, over 80 congressional candidates have “endorsed or given credence to conspiracy theory or promoted QAnon content,” according to Media Matters for America. Of this, at least one candidate – Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has expressed support for QAnon – is likely to be elected to U.S. Congress.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ummk5a/article32881304.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-ELECTIONTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-hindu-explains-how-qanon-went-from-a-bizarre-conspiracy-theory-to-an-election-talking-point/article32881282.ece
12,2020/10/17,Coronavirus | New virus restrictions in Europe; Merkel warns of hard days,"Meanwhile, new restrictions went into effect in several other European nations in an effort to staunch the resurgence of the pandemic.

Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to come together like they did in the spring to slow the spread of the coronavirus as the country posted another daily record of new cases Saturday.

Difficult months are ahead of us, she said in her weekly video podcast. How winter will be, how our Christmas will be, that will all be decided in these coming days and weeks, and it will be decided by our behavior.

Meanwhile, new restrictions went into effect in several other European nations in an effort to staunch the resurgence of the pandemic.

In Paris and eight other French cities, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and other establishments were being forced to close no later than 9 p.m. to try to reduce contact among people. The country was deploying 12,000 extra police officers to enforce the new rules.

In Britain, a three-tier regional approach to battle the pandemic introduced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week went into effect, with each level bringing in progressively tighter restrictions.

On Saturday, tier-2 cities like London and York were subject to a ban on socializing with people from other households indoors, while the county of Lancashire joined Liverpool in tier 3 with the tightest restrictions.

Among other things, that means pubs have been forced to close and socialization with others is banned even in many outdoor settings.

In Northern Ireland a circuit breaker lockdown lasting four weeks came into force Friday in an attempt to quickly tamp down the spread of the virus. All pubs and restaurants must close except for takeaway services, and schools will close for two weeks for an extended half-term holiday.

Data from Friday showed that a further 136 people died in the U.K. within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total official toll to 43,429.

On Friday, the World Health Organization warned that intensive care units in a number of European cities could reach maximum capacity in the coming weeks if the number of infections is not slowed.

In Germany, which was widely lauded for being able to rapidly slow the spread of the pandemic when it first broke out, the numbers have been climbing rapidly recently.

On Saturday, the country’s disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 7,830 cases overnight, a new record.

Like most countries, Germany has been grappling with how to keep schools and businesses open, while trying to prevent people from coming into close contact with one another.

Germany has registered a total of 356,387 coronavirus cases, though a relatively low 9,767 deaths.

With the numbers again rising, however, Ms. Merkel urged Germans to avoid unnecessary travel, cancel parties and remain at home whenever it is possible.

What brought us so well through the first half year of the pandemic? she asked. It was that we stood together and obeyed the rules out of consideration and common sense. This is the most effective remedy we currently have against the pandemic and it is more necessary now than ever. In the neighboring Czech Republic, the number of new infections surpassed 10,000 for the first time, surging to 11,105 on Friday, the Health Ministry said.

That was almost 1,400 more than the previous record set a day earlier and the country has now registered a total of 160,112 cases, including 1,283 deaths.

After a series of new restrictive measures adopted by the government to slow down the surge, Health Minister Roman Prymula said he still expects a rise of those testing positive for about two weeks.

Italy’s northern Lombardy region, where the European coronavirus outbreak began in late February, has taken new measures to contain rebounding infections, limiting bar service and alcohol sales, banning contact sports and closing bingo parlors.

The regional government late Friday also called for high schools to adopt hybrid schedules, with students alternating in-person with online learning.

The measures were taken after Lombardy, Italy’s most populous region, once again become the most affected in the COVID-19 resurgence, adding more than 2,000 infections a day. Hospitals are coming under strain and intensive care units are filling up.

The new measures allow only table service for bars from 6 p.m., ban takeout alcohol sales from that time and prohibit all consumption of booze in public spaces, an effort to eliminate crowds from forming in piazzas with takeout drinks.

Italy’s other hardest-hit region, southern Campania, has taken similarly strict measures, including a shutdown of schools for two weeks. After parents protested, the regional governor backed off Friday and allowed daycare centers to remain open.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2vqqc2/article32470156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANGELAMERKEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-virus-restrictions-in-europe-merkel-warns-of-hard-days/article32880797.ece
13,2020/10/17,Jacinda Ardern wins landslide re-election in New Zealand vote,"The mandate means Ms Ardern, 40, could form the first single-party government in decades, and face the challenge of delivering on the progressive transformation she promised but failed to deliver in her first term, where Labour shared power with a nationalist party.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's centre-left Labour Party won a landslide victory in New Zealand's general election on Saturday as voters rewarded her for a decisive response to COVID-19.

The mandate means Ms Ardern, 40, could form the first single-party government in decades, and face the challenge of delivering on the progressive transformation she promised but failed to deliver in her first term, where Labour shared power with a nationalist party.

“New Zealand has shown the Labour Party its greatest support in almost 50 years,” Ms Ardern told supporters after her landslide victory.

“We will not take your support for granted. And I can promise you we will be a party that governs for every New Zealander,” she said.

'Outstanding result'

Ms Ardern came out of her home in Auckland, waved and hugged gathered supporters. Opposition National Party leader Judith Collins said she had called the Prime Minister to congratulate her for an “outstanding result”.

Labour had 49.0% of the votes, far ahead of National at 27%, the Electoral Commission said, with 77% of ballots counted in an election that was largely a referendum on Ms Ardern's aggressive handling of COVID-19.

“This is a historic shift,” said political commentator Bryce Edwards of Victoria University in Wellington, describing the vote as one of the biggest swings in New Zealand's electoral history in 80 years.

Labour was on track to win 64 of the 120 seats in the country's unicameral parliament, the highest by any party since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996.

“People were very grateful and very happy with how we've handled COVID, they like the shape of the plan that we've got going forward from here for the economy,” said Finance Minister Grant Robertson, a top Labour MP.

Geoffrey Miller, analyst at political website Democracy Project, said the victory was “very much a personal triumph for Jacinda Ardern's 'superstar' popularity and brand.”

Of Ms Ardern's current coalition partners, the nationalist New Zealand First Party had 2.6% and the Green Party 7.6%. If she is unable to form a Labour-only government, she is expected to continue to rely on the minor Greens while jettisoning New Zealand First.

A Labour-Green coalition would be the first fully left-leaning government since the 1970s, a scenario that National's Collins warned would mean more taxes and an environment hostile to business.

Ms Ardern has pledged to raise taxes on top earners, while Ms Collins promised short-term tax cuts, but they have otherwise shown few major differences on policy.

'Be strong, be kind’

The Prime Minister won global acclaim for her handling of a mass shooting last year by a white supremacist in Christchurch, with her inclusive “be strong, be kind” mantra and swift action to ban guns.

She burnished that reputation this year with a “go hard, go early” approach to the new coronavirus, which has eliminated locally spread COVID-19 in the nation.

The election was delayed by a month after new COVID-19 infections in Auckland, that led to a second lockdown in the country's largest city.

While known internationally for promoting progressive causes such as woman's rights and social justice, at home Ms Ardern faced criticism that her government failed on a promise to be transformational.

Life is back to normal in New Zealand, but its borders are still shut, its tourism sector is bleeding and economists predict a lasting recession after the harsh lockdowns.

The economy shrank at an 12.2% annual clip in the second quarter, its steepest drop since the Great Depression. Debt is forecast to rise to 56% of gross domestic product from less than 20% before the pandemic.

New Zealanders also voted on Saturday in referendums to legalise euthanasia and recreational marijuana, with results to be announced on Oct. 30. The latter vote could make New Zealand only the third country in the world to allow the adult use and sale of cannabis nationwide, after Uruguay and Canada.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ygewmz/article32880374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWZEALANDELECTIONjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pm-jacinda-ardern-on-track-for-landslide-re-election-win-in-new-zealand-vote/article32880157.ece
14,2020/10/17,Nobel winning WFP chief urges billionaires to save millions from famine,"David Beasley quoted a study published last week that said the global wealth of billionaires climbed from $8 trillion at the start of April to $10.2 trillion in July this year.

The head of the World Food Program, this year’s winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, again urged billionaires to donate just a few billion to save millions of lives, saying on Friday that the number of people marching toward starvation has jumped from 135 million to 270 million since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Humanity needs the help right now, David Beasley said. “This is a one-time request. ... The world is at a crossroads, and we need from the billionaires to step up in a way they’ve never stepped up before,” he said.

The executive director of the UN food agency told a virtual UN press conference that the global wealth of some 2,200 billionaires rose by about $2 trillion between April and July as the pandemic raged. He was referring to a study by Swiss bank UBS and accounting firm PwC published last week which said the global wealth of billionaires climbed from $8 trillion at the start of April to $10.2 trillion in July.

“I just need a few billion to save millions of lives and save humanity from one of the greatest catastrophes since World War II,” Mr. Beasley said.

Asked for names of some of the billionaires he was targeting, Mr. Beasley replied: “I don’t get to hang around with that crowd. I’m hanging around people who are starving to death.” He said WFP is greatly concerned about 2021 because budgets weren’t calculated to take into account the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr. Beasley said wealthy countries put $17 trillion into economic stimulus packages for their citizens to tackle the coronavirus, and that’s $17 trillion that isn’t going to be available for 2021.

This year, he said, many governments reached deeper into their pockets while they could and gave the UN and its agencies more money, but the governments are now tapped out.

Mr. Beasley said debts for middle- and low-income countries were put on hold or deferred until January 2021, “and that’s $8 trillion worth of debt services” coming due. In addition, remittances from overseas workers to families in developing countries have fallen, and lockdowns are adding to deteriorating economies.

It is an appalling situation, he said.

Mr. Beasley said that’s why a one-time infusion of cash from the billionaires is so essential for 2021.

He said the humanitarian crises in the world are worsening, with “Yemen the worst of the worst of the worst, Africa’s Sahel region undoubtedly one of the worst, Congo just horrific and Syria deteriorating.” He said many other countries are also deteriorating including Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia.

Mr. Beasley got COVID-19 in March and has resumed traveling, including to Niger in the Sahel where he was last week when the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize to the World Food Program stunned and delighted staff and the broader United Nations family.

The WFP chief said he went to the Sahel because nobody is bringing to the world the calamities that are developing in a catastrophic way, and this is a time we’ve all got to come together. So all hands on deck, Mr. Beasley said. “If we don’t get the support we need, you literally can be looking at famine in several dozen countries. But if we get the support we need we’ll avert famine,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/szak95/article32879210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THAPDAVIDBEASLEYWFPNOBEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nobel-winning-wfp-chief-urges-billionaires-to-save-millions-from-famine-yet-again/article32879211.ece
15,2020/10/17,"Trump changes course, approves California relief for 6 fires","The reversal came the same week the Pacific Gas and Electric utility cut off service to more than 40,000 Northern California customers to prevent powerful winds from damaging equipment and sparking wildfires amid a fall heat wave.

President Donald Trump’s administration abruptly reversed course and approved California’s application for disaster relief funds to clean up damage from six recent deadly and destructive blazes that have scorched the State, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday.

“Just got off the phone with President Trump who has approved our Major Disaster Declaration request. Grateful for his quick response,” Mr Newsom said in a brief statement.

Neither he nor the White House gave details on why the administration shifted positions less than two days after it initially denied the State’s request for a declaration that officials said could provide the State with hundreds of millions of dollars.

The reversal came the same week the Pacific Gas and Electric utility cut off service to more than 40,000 Northern California customers to prevent powerful winds from damaging equipment and sparking wildfires amid a fall heat wave.

Electricity was restored to most customers by Friday evening, PG&E said.

Preliminary inspections found 30 instances of weather-related damage, including downed power lines in areas where winds were the strongest, PG&E said.

The utility better targeted outages this time after it was criticized in 2019 for cutting power to about 800,000 customers and leaving about 2 million people in the dark for days.

White House spokesman Judd Deere previously said California’s disaster declaration request was not supported by the relevant data needed for approval.

He initially said Mr Trump agreed with Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Pete Gaynor, who said in a three-paragraph rejection letter that the damage was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the (state’s) capabilities.

The Governor and (GOP) Leader (Kevin) McCarthy spoke and presented a convincing case and additional on-the-ground perspective for reconsideration leading the President to approve the declaration,” Deere said in a statement after Trump’s change of heart.

Mr McCarthy thanked Mr Trump in a tweet for providing the assistance needed to rebuild and repair.

Fellow Republican US Rep. Tom McClintock said in a tweet that Mr McCarthy told him the President has committed to reverse FEMA’s decision ... and help is on the way.

Both congressmen represent areas harmed by wildfires.

The State had planned to appeal the denial and believed it had a strong case, Brian Ferguson, a spokesman with the governor’s Office of Emergency Services, said before the reversal.

Mr Newsom asked for the major disaster declaration on September 28 to cover fires in Fresno, Los Angeles, Madera, Mendocino, San Bernardino, San Diego and Siskiyou counties.

The 30-page request described the disasters and pointed out that damage assessments were incomplete because the fires were still raging and access was difficult.

Federal major disaster declarations allow for cost-sharing for damage, cleanup and rebuilding between the state and federal governments. They also activate relief programs led by FEMA.

The dispute surfaced as a representative of one fire-stricken area warned that time was running out to clean up debris before rain and snow arrived, bringing the threat of mudslides and toxins being washed into a river watershed.

Denials of relief are rare and Mr Newsom, a Democrat, has previously praised the Republican administration for approving aid related to the fires and the coronavirus pandemic.

The White House said Mr Trump quickly approved wildfire relief that was supported by damage estimates.

Among the fires listed in the now-approved aid application is the Creek Fire, which erupted in the Sierra Nevada on September 4 and is 60 per cent contained after burning 850 homes and more than 537 square miles (1,391 square kilometers) in Fresno and Madera counties.

Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson of Fresno said the state needs to move quickly to avoid further problems in areas left barren by fires.

“We’re going to see rain pretty soon, snow pretty soon,” he told an online briefing.

“If we don’t get into those areas quickly we’re going to miss this window and we’re going to end up seeing mudslides where this toxic debris goes into the San Joaquin River watershed.”

No major new fires were reported statewide early Friday, but warnings of dangerously hot, dry and gusty conditions that can fan fires were expected to remain in effect until the evening. Nearly 9,000 firefighters remain on the lines of 21 fires.

Near San Francisco’s international airport, crews were battling a smoky grass fire burning on a highly visible hill with an iconic sign welcoming people to South San Francisco.

The city of nearly 70,000 people said on social media that authorities were on the scene and evacuation instructions would follow if needed.

Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas.

Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.

It has been a disastrous wildfire season in California, with more than 8,500 blazes burning more than 6,400 square miles (16,000 square kilometers) since the start of the year. Thirty-one people have died and some 9,200 buildings have been destroyed.

Most of this year’s fires have occurred since mid-August, when an unusual siege of thousands of lightning strikes ignited huge blazes.

The causes of two fires that broke out in September remain under investigation. PG&E equipment is being examined in connection with the Zogg Fire in Northern California, and Southern California Edison equipment is under scrutiny in the Bobcat Fire near Los Angeles.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qp9d3e/article32879112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FIREKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-changes-course-approves-california-relief-for-6-fires/article32879113.ece
16,2020/10/17,"Pak military, ISI installed ‘puppet govt’ of Imran Khan, says Nawaz Sharif","The former PM was addressing the first power show of the alliance of 11 opposition parties in Gujranwala

Pakistan’s former prime minister and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif has accused the military and the intelligence agency of being behind his ouster as premier and installing their “puppet government” by bringing Imran Khan into power.

Sharif was addressing the first power show of the alliance of 11 opposition parties — Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) — in Gujranwala, some 80 km from Lahore, late on Friday night via video link from London.

On September 20, the opposition parties announced the formation of the PDM and launch of a three-phased anti-government movement under an action plan starting with countrywide public meetings, protest demonstrations and rallies before a decisive long march towards Islamabad in January 2021 to oust the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) government.

Targeting the military leadership, Sharif told the gathering: “(Army chief) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa ended my government. He rigged 2018 elections and imposed incapable Imran Khan on the nation. Gen. Bajwa is a direct culprit and he will have to give an answer to this.”

Bajwa is directly responsible for the miseries and sufferings of the people by imposing an inept PTI government, the Pakistani Muslim League (Nawaz) chief alleged.

He also accused the Inter-Services Intelligence of being behind the fall of his government and said the entire episode happened with the help of ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed.

“You (Hammed) will have to answer this too,” he said, accusing the military and the ISI of “installing” their “puppet government by bringing Imran Khan into power“.

'Will continue to speak'

“I ask the people present in the rally, don’t be afraid to mention the name who imposed this incapable Imran on us,” the three-time prime minister said.

Referring to the military, 70-year-old Sharif said, “You can label me a traitor if you want, seize my properties, file false cases against me but I will continue to speak for my people.”

“They call us traitors...this is not new...PML-N’s mandate was stolen and a nalayak (incapable) and puppet Imran Khan was brought into power,” he said.

The PML-N chief, currently out on bail, is facing multiple corruption charges. The Islamabad High Court had allowed him to go to London for medical treatment in November last year.

This is not the first time that Sahrif has gone after the military leadership. During the opposition’s multiparty conference last month, he had bitterly criticised the army, saying there was a state above the state in the country . However, he had refrained from naming anyone.

Since his anti-army rant, the PTI government has banned the media to broadcast his speeches.

Friday’s event was the first power show of the PDM since its formation last month with an objective to oust the “selected” PTI government. The PDM’s struggle against the Imran Khan government is widely perceived as being anti-army.

The opposition managed to pull a huge crowd at the cricket stadium that was full to its capacity.

Sharif also questioned why the violators of Constitution don’t get any punishment, while an elected prime minister is not allowed to complete his tenure. Sharif became the prime minister in the politically unstable Pakistan for a record three times, but every time he was forced to quit in the middle of his term.

The former premier also said there is “a state above a state” in Pakistan and questioned, “Who is responsible for the two governments in this country?”

The PML-N leader, however, made it clear that he was not against the army but some individuals who violated the Constitution.

“I salute my army men who sacrifice their lives for the country,” he said.

During the event, PDM president Maualana Fazlur Rehman declared that the PTI government would be sent packing by December in the wake of the opposition’s movement.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz also addressed the event.

The next rally of the PDM is on Sunday in Karachi.

The Opposition leaders had announced that they would use all political and democratic options, including no-confidence motions and mass resignations from Parliament to seek “the selected” prime minister’s resignation.

The Opposition parties have accused the powerful army of rigging the 2018 elections that brought Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party to power.

The Oppostion parties are openly opposing the military’s interference in politics and elections for the first time in the recent history of the country.

Sharif has been living in London since November last year after he was allowed by the courts and the government to go there for a period of eight weeks for medical treatment. But he did not come back, while his lawyers told the court that he was still recovering.

The Islamabad High Court through newspaper advertisements has asked Sharif to appear before it by November 24 to avoid being declared a “proclaimed offender”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4l8e2q/article32878931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDSHARIF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pak-military-isi-installed-puppet-govt-of-imran-khan-says-nawaz-sharif/article32878907.ece
17,2020/10/17,“Kamala-mala-mala? Whatever”: Senator mispronounces Kamala Harris’ name at Trump rally,"A spokesperson for Republican Senator David Perdue said the first-term senator didn’t mean anything by it.

Republican Senator David Perdue mocked Kamala Harris, his Senate colleague and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, by repeatedly mispronouncing her name at a Georgia rally for President Donald Trump.

Also read: Kamala Harris, a woman with many firsts to her name

Mr. Perdue on Friday was wrapping up his remarks at an event in Macon when he referred to Harris as “KAH’-mah-lah? Kah-MAH’-lah? Kamala-mala-mala? I don’t know. Whatever.” The audience laughed.

A spokesperson for Mr. Perdue said the first-term senator didn’t mean anything by it. Ms. Harris’ political opponents have repeatedly mispronounced her name since she became the first Black woman on a major party ticket, a trend many Democrats say smacks of racism.

Her first name is pronounced KAH’-mah-lah — or, as she explains in her biography, “‘comma-la,’ like the punctuation mark.”

Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are among the top Republicans who have repeatedly mispronounced it. A few Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, have said it incorrectly, too.

Ms. Harris’ spokesperson, Sabrina Singh, responded to Mr. Perdue’s remark in a tweet: Well that is incredibly racist. Vote him out.” In a second tweet, she wrote, “He has been her Senate colleague for over 3 years. 3. Years. THREE. Do better.”

Casey Black, a spokesperson for Mr. Perdue’s campaign, tweeted that the senator simply mispronounced Sen. Harris’ name. He didn’t mean anything by it, Ms. Black wrote. He was making an argument against the radical socialist agenda that she and her endorsed candidate Jon Ossoff are pushing.

Jon Ossoff, who is running against Mr. Perdue in November, tweeted that his opponent mocked Sen. Harris’ name, adding, “We are so much better than this.” Mr. Ossoff, who staged an unsuccessful bid for Congress in a 2017 special election, also tweeted a fundraising message over video of Mr. Perdue’s comments and said in another tweet, “Senator Perdue never would have done this to a male colleague. Or a white colleague. And everyone knows it.”

Georgia’s Democratic Party demanded that Mr. Perdue apologise.

“Senator Perdue’s intentionally disrespectful mispronunciation of Senator Harris’s name is a bigoted and racist tactic straight from President Trump’s handbook,” Nikema Williams, chair of the Georgia Democratic Party, said in a statement. “He owes Georgians an apology for his offensive display.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/erz35d/article32878914.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020TRUMPTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kamala-mala-mala-whatever-senator-mispronounces-kamala-harris-name-at-trump-rally/article32878915.ece
18,2020/10/17,Teacher beheaded in France after showing Mohammed cartoons,"The assailant, whose identity has not been established, was shot by police as they tried to arrest him and later died of his injuries, police said.

French teacher who had recently shown students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed was beheaded outside his school on Friday, in what President Emmanuel Macron called an “Islamist terrorist attack”.

The assailant, whose identity has not been established, was shot by police as they tried to arrest him and later died of his injuries, police said.

France has seen a wave of Islamist violence since the 2015 terror attacks on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in the capital.

French anti-terror prosecutors said they were treating the assault as “a murder linked to a terrorist organisation”.

The attack happened on the outskirts of Paris at around 5:00 p.m. (1500 GMT) near the middle school where the teacher worked in Conflans Saint-Honorine, a northwestern suburb around 30 kilometres from the centre of the French capital.

The killing bore the hallmarks of “an Islamist terrorist attack”, Mr. Macron said as he visited the scene.

Visibly moved, the President said that “the entire nation” stood ready to defend teachers and that “obscurantism will not win”.

Also read: Emmanuel Macron says Islam ‘in crisis’, unveils anti-radicalism plan

Four people, including a minor, have been arrested, a judicial source told AFP early Saturday. All were related to the assailant, the source added.

'Super nice, super friendly'

The victim was a history teacher who recently showed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed as part of a class discussion on freedom of expression, police said.

A parent of a pupil at the school said the teacher might have stirred “controversy” by asking Muslim pupils to leave the room before showing the cartoons.

“According to my son, he was super nice, super friendly, super kind,” the parent, Nordine Chaouadi, told AFPTV.

The teacher “simply said to the Muslim children: ‘Leave, I don't want it to hurt your feelings.’ That's what my son told me,” the parent said.

According to a judicial source, an identity card found on the assailant indicated he was born in Moscow in 2002, although investigators were waiting for formal identification.

Police said they were investigating a tweet posted from an account that showed a picture of the teacher's head, and which has since been shut down.

It was unclear whether the message, which contained a threat against Mr. Macron — described as “the leader of the infidels” — had been posted by the attacker, they said.

'Nothing ever happens here'

Residents in the usually calm neighbourhood said they were shocked while pupils from the school, some accompanied by their parents, gathered in the street checking their phones for updates.

“Nothing ever happens here,” said Mohand Amara, who lives nearby, as he walked his dog not far from the school.

“It makes me sad — decapitated, that's shocking,” said 15-year-old Virginie, who used to be the murdered teacher's student and said she had “good memories” of him.

Police had arrived at the scene after receiving a call about a suspicious individual loitering near the school, a police source said.

They discovered the dead man and soon spotted the suspect, armed with a blade, who threatened them as they tried to arrest him.

They opened fire and injured him severely. The man later died of his injuries, a judicial source said.

'Abominable'

The scene was cordoned off and a bomb disposal unit dispatched because of the suspected presence of an explosive vest, a police source said.

France's parliament suspended Friday's debate after news of the decapitation, with session president Hugues Renson, visibly moved, calling the attack “abominable”.

MPs stood as Mr. Renson said that “in the name of all of us, I want to honour the memory of the victim.”

Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer tweeted: “The Republic is under attack.”

The killing comes as security forces have been on high alert during the ongoing trial of suspected accomplices of the attackers in the January 2015 terror attacks in Paris, which also saw a policeperson gunned down in the street.

It also comes just days after a follower of the Islamic State militant group who attacked a police officer with a hammer outside the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris was sentenced to 28 years in jail.

And last month, charges were brought against a 25-year old Pakistani man after he wounded two people with a meat cleaver to avenge the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed by Charlie Hebdo, which purportedly prompted the 2015 killings.

Seventeen people were killed in the three-day spree that heralded a wave of Islamist violence in France that has so far claimed more than 250 lives.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ujn4u9/article32878580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1280644657THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/teacher-beheaded-in-france-after-showing-mohammed-cartoons/article32878581.ece
19,2020/10/17,New Zealanders go to the polls as Jacinda Ardern seeks second term,"Opinion polls indicate Ms. Ardern is poised to win, with her liberal Labour Party polling far ahead of the conservative National Party.

Polling places opened on election day in New Zealand on Saturday as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern seeks a second term.

Ms. Ardern brought homemade cheese scones to campaign volunteers in Auckland and appeared relaxed as she awaited results, which will be announced later in the evening.

Opinion polls indicate Ms. Ardern is poised to win, with her liberal Labour Party polling far ahead of the conservative National Party, led by Judith Collins. A record number of voters cast early ballots in the two weeks leading up to the election.

On the campaign trail, Ms. Ardern has been greeted like a rock star by people who have crammed into malls and spilled onto streets to cheer her on and get selfies with her.

One question will be whether Labour can win an outright majority in Parliament, something that hasn’t happened since New Zealand implemented a proportional voting system 24 years ago. Typically, parties must form alliances to govern, but this time there’s a chance Ms. Ardern and Labour will be able to go it alone.

Ms. Ardern’s rival Ms. Collins says she still believes she can win and that polls have been wrong before, notably about Brexit and the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Track record

Ms. Ardern, 40, won the top job after the 2017 election when Labour formed an alliance with two other parties. The following year, she became only the second world leader to give birth while in office.

She became a role model for working mothers around the world, many of whom saw her as a counterpoint to President Donald Trump. And she was praised for her handling of last year’s attack on two Christchurch mosques, when a white supremacist gunned down 51 Muslim worshippers.

She moved quickly to pass new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons.

In late March this year, when only about 100 people had tested positive for COVID-19, Ms. Ardern and her health officials put New Zealand into a strict lockdown with a motto of “Go hard and go early.” She shut the borders and outlined an ambitious goal of eliminating the virus entirely rather than just trying to control its spread.

With New Zealand having the advantage of being an isolated island nation, the strategy worked. New Zealand eliminated community transmission for 102 days before a new cluster was discovered in August in Auckland. Ms. Ardern swiftly imposed a second lockdown in Auckland and the new outbreak faded away. The only new cases found recently have been among returning travellers, who are in quarantine.

The Auckland outbreak also prompted Ms. Ardern to postpone the election by a month and helped increase the early voter turnout.

Ms. Collins, 61, is a former lawyer. She served as a minister when National was in power and prides herself on a blunt, no-nonsense approach, a contrast to Ms. Ardern’s empathetic style. Ms. Collins is promising sweeping tax cuts in response to the economic downturn caused by the virus.

In the election, voters also have a say on two contentious social issues — whether to legalise marijuana and euthanasia. Polls indicate the euthanasia referendum is likely to pass while the marijuana vote remains close.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/j4um2w/article32878566.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWZEALANDELECTIONTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-zealanders-go-to-the-polls-as-jacinda-ardern-seeks-second-term/article32878567.ece
20,2020/10/17,Barack Obama to campaign for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,"This would be the first time that the 59-year-old former President would be campaigning for them in person.

Former U.S. President Barack Obama will campaign for Democratic party presidential candidate Joe Biden in Pennsylvania next week, the Biden campaign has said.

Mr. Biden, 77, was the Vice President during Mr. Obama’s two terms.

While Mr. Obama has endorsed Mr. Biden and his running mate and India-origin Senator Kamala Harris by making online campaigns for them, this would be the first time that the 59-year-old former President would be campaigning in person.

Four years after he left the presidency, Mr. Obama because of his oratory skills, still remains the biggest crowd puller for the opposition Democratic party.

“On Wednesday, October 21, (former) president Obama will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to campaign on behalf of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,” the Biden campaign said in a statement on Friday afternoon.

No other details were immediately available.

Mr. Biden, as per the latest opinion polls, leads against Republican incumbent President Donald Trump by over nine points on an average.

However, there are signs that the polls are tightening, especially after Mr. Trump resumed his rallies after recovering from COVID-19. He has been attracting thousands of supporters to his election rallies in the battleground states.

Mr. Obama is the only Democratic leader who can attract a big crowd in his election rallies. His jumping into the campaign, with a little over a fortnight left for the presidential elections, is likely to motivate and encourage Black Americans and fence sitters to come out and vote, Biden strategists believe.

A day earlier, the Democratic National Committee released a new ad featuring Mr. Obama, The 2020 Election Is Already Here.

“It highlights the stakes of this election, the importance of Americans voting now to make their voices heard and how they can find all the information they need to make their plan to vote. Millions of Americans are already voting, make sure you stand up and join them,” Obama said in the ad.

“There will always be reasons to think your vote doesn’t matter -- that’s not new. What is new is a growing movement for justice, equality and progress on so many issues. This really is a tipping point, and that momentum only continues if we win this election. But it’s gonna be close. It could come down to a handful of voters just like you. So I’m asking you to bring this thing home. Leave no doubt. Vote early,” he said.

The ad is being run in all the battleground States through digital platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Hulu, and YouTube.

During the Democratic National Convention this summer, Mr. Obama had launched a blistering attack against Mr. Trump. “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,” he said in August.

“And the consequences of that failure are severe. 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before,” Mr. Obama said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4f17y1/article32399513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1140816197THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/barack-obama-to-campaign-for-joe-biden-and-kamala-harris/article32878382.ece
21,2020/10/17,Justices to weigh Donald Trump census plan to exclude non-citizens,"The outcome of the census case could affect the distribution of political power for the next 10 years.

The Supreme Court agreed on October 16 to take up President Donald Trump’s policy, blocked by a lower court, to exclude people living in the U.S. illegally from the census count that will be used to allocate seats in the House of Representatives.

Never in U.S. history have immigrants been excluded from the population count that determines how House seats, and by extension Electoral College votes, are divided among the states, a three-judge federal count said in September when it held Mr. Trump’s policy illegal.

The justices put the case on a fast track, setting arguments for Nov. 30. A decision is expected by the end of the year or early in January, when Mr. Trump has to report census numbers to the House.

Mr. Trump’s nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, could take part in the case if, as seems likely, she is confirmed by then.

Last year, the court by a 5-4 vote barred Mr. Trump from adding a census question asking people about their citizenship. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last month, was part of that slim majority. Ms. Barrett would take Ms. Ginsburg’s seat.

Mr. Trump left it to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, to figure out how many immigrants are not living legally in each state.

The outcome of the census case could affect the distribution of political power for the next 10 years. The census also helps determine the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal funding annually.

The administration told the court that the president retains discretion to exclude illegal aliens from the apportionment based on their immigration status. The American Civil Liberties Union, representing a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups, said Mr. Trump’s violation of federal law is not particularly close or complicated.

The Supreme Court separately allowed the administration to end the actual census count this week, blocking a court order that would have kept the count going until the end of the month.

The court did not take action on two other administration appeals of controversial policies on asylum seekers and the border wall that also were ruled illegal by lower courts.

Since early last year, the administration has made asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings, which has forced tens of thousands of people to return to Mexico.

Known informally as Remain in Mexico, the policy became a key pillar of the administration’s response to a surge of asylum-seeking families from Central America at the southern border. It also drew criticism for having people wait in dangerous cities.

The administration also is appealing a ruling that the administration can’t spend more than Congress authorized for border security. After Congress refused to give Mr. Trump all the money he wanted for the wall, he declared a national emergency at the border and Defence Department officials transferred billions of dollars to the project.

Lower courts sided with states and environmental groups that challenged the transfer as a violation of the Constitution’s provision giving Congress the power to determine spending. A separate suit from members of Congress also is making its way to the court.

The justices blocked the court rulings in both the asylum seekers and border wall cases, leaving the policies in effect. Arguments wouldn’t heard before next year and the issues would have much less significance if Joe Biden were to become president. He could rescind Mr. Trump’s policy forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico, for example.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ok0h04/article32878282.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CENSUS-TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/justices-to-weigh-donald-trump-census-plan-to-exclude-non-citizens/article32878283.ece
22,2020/10/17,FBI probing if Russia involved in Hunter Biden email story,"The unlikely account of how the emails surfaced raised immediate questions about Russian involvement

The FBI is investigating whether emails that were published by the New York Post related to Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, are connected to a possible Russian influence operation to spread disinformation, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The newspaper said in its story on Wednesday that it had obtained a hard drive from Rudy Giuliani containing the emails, and that the messages were found on a laptop that had been left last year at a Delaware computer repair shop for service but never retrieved.

The unlikely account of how the emails surfaced raised immediate questions about Russian involvement, particularly because U.S. officials have warned that Russia — which backed Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign through hacking and a covert social media campaign — is interfering again this year.

The episode is being investigated as part of a possible Russian influence operation, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press to discuss an ongoing matter. It underscores the extent to which Mr. Giuliani, through his activities, is a risk to a White House that spent years shadowed by a federal investigation into whether Trump associates had coordinated with Russia.

The authenticity of the emails remained unclear as of Friday, including whether they were hacked or possibly forged or both. Mr. Giuliani did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment, but he said in a Fox News interview on Friday that the material was authentic as hell.

An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday, citing the bureau’s practice of neither confirming nor denying investigations.

NBC News was the first to report the FBI’s investigation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/n0vjxe/article32878229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-HUNTERBIDEN-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fbi-probing-if-russia-involved-in-hunter-biden-email-story/article32878230.ece
23,2020/10/17,"U.S. presidential election | Donald Trump revels in division, chaos: Joe Biden","Joe Biden said the country is paying a heavy price for Preisdent Donald Trump’s policies on COVID-19

U.S. President Donald Trump “revels” in division and chaos, and he will do anything to distract people from his failures to deal with the COVID-19 situation, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has alleged.

Speaking at a restricted election campaign event on October 16 at Southfield in Michigan, a battleground state, Mr. Biden said the country is paying a heavy price for Mr. Trump’s policies on COVID-19.

“Hate never goes away. It only hides. And if you give it oxygen, it grows. So we need to be clear: from the President on down in this country, there is no place for hate in America,” he said.

“President Trump revels in division and chaos. He will do anything to distract us from focusing on his failures to deal with this virus and protect this nation,” Mr. Biden said.

“He is still living in a dream world and “keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear like a miracle.” the presidential candidate said.

“But it’s [coronavirus] not disappearing. In fact, it’s on the rise again. It’s getting worse. We all know the terrible price this nation has paid. Lives are being lost. Unemployment is way up,” Mr. Biden said.

He said that across Michigan and the country, people are worried about making their next rent or mortgage payment, whether their health care will be ripped away in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, worried about school and their children.

More than 215,000 dead because of COVID-19 and experts say “we will lose nearly another 200,000 lives in the next few months”, he said.

This is “because he refuses to follow science. Because he refuses to embrace wearing a mask. Because he refuses to practice social distancing”, Mr. Biden said.

He alleged that as a consequence of Mr. Trump’s overwhelming lying, negligence, and irresponsible actions, there are empty chairs around dinner tables.

“But mishandling the pandemic isn’t enough for Trump. On top of that, he’s still trying to take away your health care,” Mr. Biden said.

Mr. Trump, he alleged, is still determined to destroy the Affordable Care Act. This isn’t hyperbole — this is real. As real as it gets, Mr. Biden said.

Reiterating that Mr. Trump will be the first President in modern U.S. history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he began, Mr. Biden said he has a plan to bring the economy back.

“An independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, projects that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs — over 7 million more jobs than the President’s economic plan, and $1 trillion more in economic growth than the President’s plan,” he said.

Mr. Biden assured that he is not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. “You won’t pay a penny more. But I’ll ask big corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share for a change,” he said.

“Of Trumps’ more than $2 trillion dollar tax cut, I’m going to roll back $1.5 trillion of his giveaways to the biggest companies and top 1%. The money we raise will allow us to invest in working people and growing the middle class, and make sure everyone is included in the deal,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uonw9m/article32878184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BIDEN-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-election-donald-trump-revels-in-division-chaos-joe-biden/article32878185.ece
24,2020/10/17,"Google sweetens Fitbit concessions, EU okay in sight: sources","Alphabet's Google has tweaked concessions aimed at allaying EU antitrust concerns about its $2.1 billion purchase of Fitbit, people familiar with the matter said, putting it on course to secure EU approval for the deal.

The world's most popular internet search engine last month offered to restrict the use of Fitbit data for Google ads, facilitate rival makers of wearables seeking to connect to the Android platform and allow third parties' continued access to Fitbit users' data with their consent.

Google revised the package after the European Commission received feedback from rivals and consumers, the people said, declining to provide details. The move could also help stave off a possible EU charge sheet setting out specific concerns.

The EU competition enforcer has to date not sought further feedback from the market, indicating the changes have likely passed muster with the Commission.

The EU competition enforcer, which earlier on Friday extended the deadline for its decision to Jan. 8 from December 23 in agreement with Google, declined to comment.

Google reiterated its previous statement, saying that the deal was about devices and not data. Fitbit shares gained after the Reuters story and were up 1.58% in early U.S. trade.

“The wearables space is crowded, and we believe the combination of Google and Fitbit's hardware efforts will increase competition in the sector, benefiting consumers and making the next generation of devices better and more affordable,” Google said.

Concessions so far, however, have failed to appease rivals and customers.

25,2020/10/17,"Bihar Assembly elections | Our main concern was to consolidate anti-BJP vote, says Dipankar Bhattacharya","The non-BJP alliance is the result of a felt need of the people

For the first time the CPI (ML) is fighting elections within the constraints of an alliance. Having won three seats in 2015, when it fought alone amid a wave in favour of RJD-JD (U) alliance, expectations are sky high. CPI (ML) General Secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya speaks of an anti-incumbency wave and anger among voters

This is the first time you are fighting an election in an alliance. What compelled you to do so?

Certainly this is not with the view of winning seats alone. We have demonstrated over and over again that you can independently contest and win seats. In fact, our very emergence in 1989 for the first time when Dalits exercised their franchise, we won the Arrah Lok Sabha seat, against the established political wisdom. The main issue is that BJP poses a real threat to our democracy and constitution. Our primary concern was to ensure consolidation of the anti-BJP vote as much as possible. Of course, we tried in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections too, but it didn’t happen. It was limited to some kind of good will gesture on the part of RJD, where they left one seat for us and we reciprocated by extending support to them. What made it possible this time is that RJD drew its lessons from the 2019 elections and there has been a tremendous demand for this alliance from the ground. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, only on four seats the opposition candidate managed to poll more than four lakh votes; these were the seats where our votes and RJD votes converged. Next to RJD, this is a common knowledge in Bihar, CPI (ML) has the biggest cadre.

Are you happy with the seat sharing arrangement between the opposition mahagatbandhan?

I don’t want to talk about the seat sharing arrangement. Left together got 29 seats, which is less than what the Left should get. So I will not say I am fully satisfied. But this alliance is a result of a felt need of people; it has not been imposed from above, it is a natural alliance that has emerged.

If the mahagatbandhan was to win, will the CPI (ML) be part of the the government?

If you go by our programme, it is unlikely that CPI (ML) will be part of the government. I believe that the Left lends credibility and stability to the government. Right now what we have is a seat sharing arrangement; it is not a front that has emerged through a shared ideological coalition. But definitely there is some ideological common ground to work against BJP and their threat to destroy democracy. Post elections we will take a call. But let me make it very clear, to help form the government and we will see to it that the government delivers. A Common Minimum Programme will emerge.

How hopeful are you that CPI (ML) will be able to better its 1990 record of winning nine seats, in then undivided Bihar.

Certainly we are hopeful. In an election, till the vote is cast and counted, confidence is a very difficult word to use. But politically we are hopeful, particularly, because in the 19 seats we are contesting we have done solid work, decades of struggle and sufficient influence among the people.

This time there is a powerful anti-incumbency against Nitish Kumar and anger runs high among people. And this anger doesn’t respect the established social equations and political boundaries. In our areas too, we are finding that cutting across castes, people are responding to our campaign. It is fallacious to think that BJP will emerge unscathed and that the anger is only directed at Nitish Kumar. Probably for the first time in many years, people are disillusioned by Narendra Modi. The lockdown revealed the open secret that migration from Bihar has never really declined because there are no decent employment opportunities in the State.

26,2020/10/17,"Bihar Assembly elections | Grand Alliance promises jobs to youths, end farm laws if voted to power","Nitish Kumar government was the first in the country to do away with the APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) Act in 2006.

The RJD-led Grand Alliance (GA) on Saturday released its joint manifesto for the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections, promising to offer jobs to 10 lakh youngsters and repealing the new farm laws recently enacted by the central government if they are voted to power.

Releasing the manifesto titled “Badlav Ka Sankalp” (commitment to change) in the presence of All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala and other Mahagathbandhan leaders, Tejashwi Yadav said their government, if elected, would first approve the process for appointments on about 10 lakh jobs in the government.

“Contractual teachers would be entitled for same pay for same work, for which they have been agitating for long,” said Mr. Yadav, who is the opposition chief ministerial candidate.

Assuring the people that the coalition will stand by its commitments, Mr. Yadav said that they were not leaders who conveniently forget their promises and that the state has still not been accorded a special status — a demand echoed for years by political parties in Bihar.

“(Donald) Trump will not come to accord special status to Bihar, which was once promised by the Prime Minister,” said Mr. Yadav, in an apparent reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ties with the U.S. President.

Mr. Kumar has raised the issue of granting special status to the land-locked Bihar several times, both during the Congress-led UPA and the BJP-helmed NDA — which could bring investment into the state by providing concessions in taxes to prospective industries.

Mr. Surjewala said that the first assembly sitting of the GA government would see annulment of the three controversial farm acts that, he alleged, defeat the objectives of green revolution in the state.

Nitish Kumar government was the first in the country to do away with the APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) Act in 2006.

“If we form the government, under the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav, we will pass a Bill in the first Vidhan Sabha session to scrap the three anti-farm laws.

“Can PM Modi and Nitish tell us that if all mandis are destroyed then how will the farmers get MSP,” Mr. Surjewala asked.

The centre last month enacted three farm reforms to liberalise agricultural markets and end local monopolies of regulated markets known as agricultural produce marketing committees.

Identifying unemployment as a big issue, Mr. Yadav reiterated “We will approve 10 lakh jobs in the state government in the very first cabinet of the alliance government if voted to power.” Focusing on crimes against women and children in the state, the Grand Alliance leaders said many perpetrators of gang rape against minors at Muzaffarpur shelter home were still at large.

Waiver of fee for competitive examination for jobs and helpline for migrant workers were also been promised in the manifesto.

Countering charges of “inexperience”, Mr. Yadav said that the vision for development did not necessarily come with age.

Mr. Kumar without naming Mr. Yadav has been speaking about “inexperience” of the young leadership of the opponents who he said don’t know how to work or get the work done from others.

“As the deputy CM, we have laid the foundation of development with great vision. I was a minister of road construction department, proposed development of dedicated expressway to connect the Bihta airport. Many state highways were converted as the national highways (NHs),” said Lalu Prasad’s younger son who was the deputy Chief Minister before JD(U) left mahagathbandhan.

Mr. Yadav further alleged that more than 60 scams have taken place under chief minister Nitish Kumar’s government in Bihar and that the Janata Dal (United)-BJP combine had stabbed the states people on their backs.

Congress in-charge of Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil, State party chief Madan Mohan Jha, chairman of BPCC campaign committee Akhilesh Prasad Singh, national RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha and CPI(ML) leader Shashi Yadav were also present during the release of manifesto.

Mr. Surjewala accused Bihar chief minister of “cheating the people of Bihar” by walking out of the grand alliance in whose favour they had voted in 2015, and said the election is meant to give a new direction to the state which is suffering from “misrule.”

Taking a swipe at the BJP, the Congress leader said, the saffron party is part of three alliances in the current Bihar polls — one with the JD(U), another with LJP and third one with AIMIM (of Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi).”",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/xm45en/article32880472.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANIFESTO,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-grand-alliance-promises-jobs-to-youths-end-farm-laws-if-voted-to-power/article32880473.ece
27,2020/10/17,"Bihar Assembly elections | We will see a BJP-LJP government, says Chirag Paswan","Brushing aside recent comments against him by BJP leaders, the LJP president exudes confidence ahead of poll

In an interview over the phone, LJP president Chirag Paswan speaks to The Hindu about the political turmoil after his father Ram Vilas Paswan’s death and BJP leaders’ comments against him.

This is the first election where your father Ram Vilas Paswan is not with you and a critical election for the LJP, at that. Your thoughts.

The past couple of weeks have been a very difficult time for me. Apart from shuttling between the hospital and party meetings, what made me restless was the fact that I could not talk to my father. For me, it was a matter of routine to share in the evening whatever happened through the day. He was my best friend...I had that kind of comfortable relationship with him, where I could speak my heart out.

In fact, I would say, the worst day was when we took the decision to go it alone in the election. My father was already on the ventilator. I wanted to tell him, seek his advice, but he was not in a position to speak to me. My mother told me to go, hold his hand and say whatever I had to say. I spent some 3-4 hours in that ICU cubicle holding his hand, speaking to him and that gave me a lot of comfort.

In the past, whenever the LJP and the JD(U) have come face to face, your party has had a dismal performance. Haven’t you bitten more than you can chew?

Not really, my confidence comes from my father, he used to push me and often instigate me. He would say, that if he could go it alone in 2005, then why should I at a young age be averse to taking bold decisions? And you must remember, we have always fought against the JD(U), be it the 2005, 2010 or 2015 Assembly election. In fact, in 2017, overnight, he [Nitish Kumar] became part of the NDA and we were thrown together. He has always worked against us. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, despite being on the same side of the alliance, the JD(U) made every attempt to sabotage my elections from Jamui.

Also read: I have not spoken to Nitish Kumar in almost a year: LJP president Chirag Paswan

My confidence also comes from the hard work I have done over the past few years and brought about organisational changes in the party along with my father. It also comes from the vision document ‘Bihar First and Bihari First,’ that we came up with after my yatra across the State. We spoke to over four lakh persons before drafting this document. My confidence comes from the anger that people have for Nitish Kumar. And I will ensure that Nitish Kumar does not become the Chief Minister of Bihar ever again in the future.

Also read: Nitish mistreated my father, Chirag Paswan tells Nadda

You have been claiming that your campaign is for installing a BJP-LJP government, but BJP Ministers and leaders in repeated statements have disowned you. Your comments?

I have no issues with their comments. I know my Chief Minister, I know his working style. He doesn’t speak on his own but makes others talk on his behalf. All these comments are because of Nitishji’s pressure on the BJP. If the reports are correct, he did not even come to the NDA press conference till he got a written assurance that the LJP will not be allowed to use Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photographs during the campaigning. These words are coming from him.

And I will give the BJP leaders their due, since, technically, they are in alliance with the JD(U) and not us in the State. I would, in fact, go a step ahead and say I am sure Nitishji will apply pressure on PM Modiji too. I will not have issues if political compulsions force Modiji to make adverse remarks about me during the campaign. He has taken care of me like a father in this difficult time. I wouldn’t want to put him in dharam sankat. I have a far deeper and personal relationship with Modiji.

Your uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, in remarks made to a television channel, said that he admires Nitish Kumar’s working style. This is in variance with your own campaign.

He has, since then, clarified his comments. There is no difference of opinion among us.

So, out of the 143 seats, how many are the LJP projected to win?

I am not an astrologer and I would not like to challenge the intelligence of the Bihari voters by making such predictions.

28,2020/10/17,A support group for parents of children with autism,"D. Rama came to India to seek help for her son through Bharatanatyam; now, she is helping other parents who face similar challenges

D. Rama, an academician, came to India primarily to help her autistic son find therapy through Bharatanatyam.

Seeking help for her child has helped her reach out to other parents facing similar challenges.

She now talks about the importance of movement for children with autism.

“We have been blessed; we have the skills, time and resources to pull our child out of a difficult place. When we came to India for our son’s arangetram, Dr. Rajeshwari, Head of Paediatrics at Kamakshi Memorial Hospital, motivated me to share my experience so that it could help other parents. She made me a part of KMH Child Development Centre's efforts,” says Rama, who has worked with MNRI (Masgutova Neurosensorimotor Reflex Integration) in the United States.

At the Centre, parents and children meet to learn and share various experiences.

In February, Ananth was invited to perform at a workshop held at the hospital. Rama has also started a support group for parents called ‘LIFESMART Families’, a WhatsApp group that keeps buzzing with conversations about the subject.

“The group runs on four pillars, which is life, interest, family and engagement. Ananth’s is an example I would like more parents to learn from. When you have a child with so many sensory motor problems, the last thing you think of is dance. I want to share what we gained by giving a serious thought to it. He took interest in dance and it has helped him overcome his challenges,” says Rama, adding that she intends to stay engaged with the group wherever she is.

She says the group is parent-lead and participants are encouraged to share their stories.

“When people see success stories, they are encouraged. They see light at the end of the tunnel even if the tunnel is very long and dark.”

29,2020/10/17,School for underprivileged children takes a big leap to tackle the digital divide,"Olcott Memorial Higher Secondary School has implemented a digital classroom model that addresses an exigency arising out of the pandemic and also promises to meet students’ long-term learning needs

Parents need not budget for their children’s education. No school fees. No uniform fees. No textbook fees. No stationery bills. No lunch packs. The school picks up the tab for all of these essentials of formal learning.

That is putting in a nutshell how Olcott Memorial Higher Secondary School in Besant Nagar empowers underprivileged families through the free gift of education made possible by donors. The school is being run as part of the Theosophical Society’s charity work.

The pandemic led the school to offer the gift again in an all-new package, this time tied with a digital gift-bow. With the crisis scoring out in-school attendance, Olcott school was up against the same challenge as other free schools being run for the underprivileged: Filling up the virtual classrooms.

“When we started online classes, only around 30 percent of the students would attend them, as a majority had no access to a smartphone and Internet. If there were 25 students in a class, only eight of them would turn up for the classes. Once parents started going to work and took what was usually the only smartphone at home, the attendance got thinner still. So, we started having these classes after 6 p.m.,” notes Sashikala Sriram, honorary academic director at Olcott Memorial Higher Secondary School.

Difficulty accessing devices and Internet data is now an all-too familiar script. Efforts to revise the script have usually involved drives to source used smartphones, tablets and computers. Olcott school’s reworked script is a tad more imaginative and innovative than most others’.

To get to the chase, in September, the school placed 120 brand-new Samsung tablets in the hands of its students from Classes X to XII, and connectivity via a Jio SIM card in every device. Its donors loosening their purse strings, the school managed to collect the ₹16 lakh necessary for the project. At the time of this article going to press, the school had extended the project’s scope and placed an order for another 40 tablets with Samsung, and the beneficiaries of this effort would be the Class IX students. For this phase of the project, an additional ₹5 lakh was raised, according to Sashikala. She estimates that by factoring in both the purchase of the tablets and the recurring expenditure of recharing the students’ SIM cards for a year, the cost per student comes to around ₹13,000.

It was a long process that led to these results. It includes introducing features that would prempt the possibility of students misusing the tab, and extending monitoring powers to teachers just to ascertain that children use the digital resource responsibly.

Two IT professionals volunteering with Olcott school for over a decade, Rahul Shankar and Sandeep Rajarajan are among the main scriptwriters of this digital-learning story.

When they got in touch with Shashikala in the midst of the pandemic to find out how the school was managing its online learning programme, they had a digital classroom model in mind. At that point, even to them, the implementation part of the concept was still largely amorphous. However, with the school willing to try it out, they quickly knuckled down to finding out what shape it could take.

Now, while the duo attended to the technological aspects of the project, the school raised funds to buy the devices and allied services.

“Rahul and Sandeep created a fund-raising flyer which we sent out to all our contacts,” recalls Sashikala.

Rahul points out that from the beginning, they did not countenance the idea of placing used devices in students’ hands, reasoning it out that doing so would be a short-sighted move that would possibly have to be repeated every year as the used devices are likely to pack up sooner than later.

Instead, the plan was to buy new devices that could be passed on to subsequent batches with some refurbishment, thereby ensuring effortless continuity of the digital learning programme.

“When you have a uniform system like this, you are directly in touch with the manufacturers, so you know who you can count on when you are having technological issues. They are also aware that it is being done for a good cause and so a good partnership is struck,” says Rahul, adding that even after schools reopen, the digital learning through this model can continue, and keep students primed for taking competitive exams.

“Initially, we were looking at paid features with which you can control enterprise devices. However, learning that Google gives its G Suite application (basic) free for non-profits and not-for-profit educational institutions, we applied to them and got it. We also got a school domain (olcottschool.org) and created accounts for students in it (We are in the process of developing the website). It reflects a model followed in institutions abroad where every student has an ID based on the school domain. With these accounts we got the students’ tablets started,” explains Rahul.

One of the striking features of the model is restricting access to unwanted apps through an android device management system, available in G Suite.

“Only essential apps are installed. Students can’t install PUBG, Candy Crush or things like that. Even if they go to PlayStore, it will show them only those apps that we have configured for the school. At present, we have given admin powers to two teachers. Through the Chrome browser, these teachers can also restrict access to certain websites,” explains Rahul.

The tab comes with a SIM card, and the two architects of the initiative and the school management understand having a call feature is a double-edged sword.

“We gave them a tablet with a SIM card facility because we can’t expect them to have WiFi at home,” explains Rahul.

“We wanted to be doubly sure students would not be hampered by network issues, and when we expressed our concern to Jio they went to the places where students largely come from and showed the network capabilities by sending us screenshots from there,” says Sandeep.

Considering teachers are denied in-person interactions with students, a call facility is a good alternative, and a much-needed one as children are also battling the pandemic, each probably in their unique manner, and would do with some kind words.

“We found out that in most of the students’ households, there was only one device. As these students can make phone calls with this tablet, teachers can now call them up and find out how they are doing. Earlier, they had to depend on their parents’ mobiles,” says Rahul.

Alive to the possibility that children may make unwanted calls that would land them in trouble, some checks are being introduced into the system, though it is far from being entirely fool-proof yet.

Rahul points out that by virtue of the Jio Enterprise services, teachers are enabled to keep tabs on children by tracking their usage patterns with the Jio SIM card.

“Jio has extended admin features to some teachers, so they can check if misuse has happened, though the SIM can’t be blocked. If someone sends an SMS, then the admin gets a notification immediately. The teacher can ask who they are sending an SMS to. From the portal, it is possible to see who it has been sent to. It will take some more time to get things more streamlined and formalised, like a big enterprise,” says Rahul.

Sashikala underlines the effectiveness of a feature that would prevent students from misusing the SIM by removing it from the tablet and using it in a mobile.

“The students can’t put the SIM back in the tablet without bringing it to the school. They have to provide the pin, which only the teachers concerned know,” she elaborates.

Parents’ role

Sashikala discloses that on a Sunday before it was time to hand over the tablets to the students, an online session was conducted with those parents who could be a part of it, to brief them about the initiative. It was essentially an exercise that sought to co-opt parents into the initiative by getting them to take responsibility for the safety of the tablets and to help it take the desire course. Not leaving anything to chance, when the tablets were handed over to parents and their children together, a written undertaking from the former was undertaken.

“These children are first generation learners, and many are hampered by the lack of a conducive learning environment at home. So, we impressed upon the parents that they should keep from watching television when the kids are studying. Invariably, a child would be living in a one-room house, where the quiet required to attend online classes may be lacking. Some children come from dysfunctional families where the father would be frittering away the earnings on alcohol. There are children who help augment the family’s income by doing odd jobs such as delivering milk packets or cleaning cars before coming to school. The document that we got the parents to sign underlines their responsibility for the safekeeping of the tablet and that they have to ensure its safe return to the school after the child’s schooling has been completed,” says Sashikala.

Rahul says that parents who value this development in their children’s learning journey would be happy with this digital learning model with all its built-in checks, as they know that when their child opens the tab, it can’t be for anything other than education.

He adds, “You cannot do anything else with the tab. People like me have a work laptop and a personal laptop. Similarly, for these students, it is a school device.”

Teachers’ role

To make the initiative sustainable, Rahul and Sandeep focussed on training the teachers to monitor it and take action if any of its strands straggle out of place.

”We worked on two Saturdays training the teachers. We have given the entire G Suite dashboard to the school so that teachers on board can monitor what happens at school, from their mobile phones. Through the admin panel in the G Suite, they will get to know if someone has finished their entire data pack for one day, and can find out from the student what depleted the pack too soon,” says Sandeep.

“On Teachers’ Day, we took them through the process — how to set it up, how to restrict and monitor the gate — and also on a step-by-step tour of the G Suite. Following the primer, we set up the 120 devices along with them. Once you set it up in the G Suite management, all you have to do is open the tablet and enter the kid’s ID and it automatically synchronises and downloads all the apps that are required for the device. Once the teachers learnt it they did not need our help anymore,” says Rahul.

Sashikala points out that the Rotary Club of Chennai Mitra has supported the initiative by donating five new laptops to the teachers.

The possibilities

Says Rahul, “This is a work in progress. We are learning about the different ways in which the tablet can be put to misuse so that in the next round we can put more restrictions. For the time being, the restrictions we have placed involve apps, games and websites that can’t be used.”

“We have accepted the fact that children are not going to use the tablet for studies all the time,” says Sandeep, adding that how the information ecosystem is designed and through continual engagement, students can be nudged to use the tablet to gain information that would contribute to their overall development as individuals.

Rahul believes that this digital programme can have an impact beyond the classroom.

“It is enabling the students to be more digitally-literate. So, there is something we are contemplating. What if we install the e-governance apps? Of course, we have not done it yet, as this is left to the discretion of the school. Through these apps, the children can help their families.” Following the success of this initiative — which they have named ‘Vidamuyarchi’ (vidamuyarchi.org) after a larger vision by the same name they have conceptualised — Rahul and Sandeep are now exploring how they could extend the digital classroom model to other schools that face similar challenges. Rahul points out that the state government’s Kalvi TV programme is commendable with its YouTube channel covering the whole gamut of subjects in every class, in both English and Tamil. “However, the benefits of such programmes will be lost to students unless they have a device to access them.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/2m8fr2/article32880779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dcapps-and-sim-card-in-tab,https://www.thehindu.com/society/school-for-underprivileged-children-takes-a-big-leap-to-tackle-the-digital-divide/article32880780.ece
30,2020/10/17,Stories from the ground,"The shows on Free/Dem community podcast speak across cultural and class divides

Hello, doston,...main aap sab ke liye ek kavita layee hoon, jo maine khud likha....” Halima begins Babli Ka Show.

“Kaash tum hote, to ek doosre ka dard bante/tum kehte, lockdown mein ghar pe rehrehkar pak gaya hoon/ main kehti meri achche achche pics dekhkar time pass karo/aur tum mere baatein sun sun kar khush ho jaate.”

Halima is one of several trainees who are part of Free/Dem, a digital media literacy programme run by the Delhi-based Ideosync Media Combine, and Babli Ka Show is one of six shows produced as part of the Free/Dem Community Podcasts. Venu Arora, Ideosync’s Director of Projects, describes the podcasts as an offshoot of their WhatsApp Radio, run by members of Tajpur Pahadi and other urban slums in the National Capital Region.

The shows are run primarily by young people ages of 16 and 23, and deal with issues related to gender equity, freedom of expression, human rights and justice, seasoned with a healthy dose of romance and humour drawn from the everyday lives of the community members.

In an episode of Zyada Bolne Wali Aurtein (Women who talk too much), 16-year-old Divya asks a group of women, “Aapka pati ka naam kya hai?” and interrogates the patriarchal norms that prevent them from calling their husbands by name, as well as the deeper belief that a woman’s identity is tied to his. In another episode of this podcast, Sarita, a 40-year-old homemaker articulates a long-felt discomfort, about why housework has come to be seen as woman’s work.

Young roles

But there are other concerns that are close to the hearts — and minds — of the young in the community too, such as 16-year-old Hemlata’s exploration of educational options in Zaroori Jaankaari, where she talks through the difference between arts, science and commerce streams.

Or in 18-year-old Sulaiman’s retelling of a family love story that led to his aunt and uncle being ostracized by the community, in the show Love is Part of Life.

One other show — the Corona Special — focuses on the community’s experiences during the pandemic, with conversations ranging from loss of livelihoods among women to access to health and relief, to the problems faced by young people trying to access online lessons.

Everyday negotiations

There’s a charming spontaneity to the shows that opens a window into the hopes, anxieties and everyday negotiations of the community, and even as it is particular, manages to speak across cultural and class divides.

Arora speaks about the need for such hyperlocal media that can get people talking about their own micro-level concerns — “because contexts shift so quickly”.

Such a platform is particularly relevant to a community like Tajpur Pahadi, made up mostly of migrants, who are “so to speak, part of the city, but they have none of the resources that the city has to offer, including the resources for having a voice.”

In large measure, the Free/Dem podcast series — and the WhatsApp radio venture — is a digital workaround in the face of a restrictive Community Radio policy that has made it virtually impossible for non-academic community organizations in urban centres to obtain a radio license.

Arora notes that while they are aware of the tensions around the digital — whether it is to do with access or ownership or data capture — it has allowed them to develop capacity in the community to tell and share their own stories.

As the host says in the introduction to the show Azaad Lab, the Free/Dem channel, is “ek aisa channel jo aapki baat sunta hai aur sunaata bhi hai”.

31,2020/10/17,Goren Bridge by Bob Jones,"Thanks for today’s deal goes to Larry Cohen. Have a look at his excellent website: www.larryco.com. Cohen was South, and he tells this story on himself.

Cohen believes that a pre-empt should be wide-ranging when partner is a passed hand, so he chose to bid two hearts with the South hand rather than one heart. That ended the auction, although West might well have competed to three diamonds. West shifted accurately to a trump when his diamond lead held the trick. East made the excellent play of inserting his jack of hearts, losing to Cohen’s king. Note that the defense would have had no chance had East played his ace of hearts instead.

Cohen had choices. He could play on spades right away, hoping the suit split 3-3 or that the player with only two spades had the singleton ace of hearts remaining. He could lead a high heart, hoping that the defenders wouldn’t cash out correctly or that the ace of clubs was with East for his opening bid. He chose to lead the jack of diamonds instead, hoping that the defense would make a mistake or that he could guess clubs correctly if the defenders put him to that test.

West won with his queen and led a heart to East’s ace. East shifted to a low club. Crunch time! Cohen decided, reasonably, to rise with his king of clubs, West won with the ace, returned a club to the jack and queen, and East accurately cashed the ace of diamonds for down one. It was really annoying to find that the spades were 3-3 all along. Oh well!",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/s9o84s/article32869274.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SM18BRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/society/several-points/article32869275.ece
32,2020/10/17,Ganga aarti on my screen: How travel companies are turning to 360° digital tours,"Visuals, maps, videos, evocative soundscapes and live narration by storytellers are among the highlights of these virtual excursions, as tour groups adapt to pandemic conditions

On a reflective day, as I sit pondering the vagaries of the pandemic and the upending of all travel plans for the near future, an email from a walking tour company that I walked with previously piques my curiosity. I am invited to join them on a virtual tour of Varanasi. An integral part of any walking tour is the sensory experience and nuanced understanding gained while traversing the unique geography it inhabits. Could such an offering be successfully ported on to the virtual realm? Or would the nuances be lost in translation?

Curious, I log into the Zoom session from my living room with a cup of tea handy as a substitute for the kulhad chai I had taken on the physical walk. A big reason the city has stayed in my mind is Aayush Rathi, co-founder/ storyteller of Roobaroo Walks, and the way he presented Varanasi through his storytelling.

Now, Rathi reintroduces me to the city through 360° visuals, maps, videos and evocative soundscapes. Many of my fellow Zoom travellers are first-time visitors. As with the physical tour, we start at Assi Ghat, where the dancing flames of the multi-layered aartis light up the early morning sky in adoration of the Ganga. Rathi talks about the sacred river, the city’s origins, and its deep spiritual significance for a confluence of faiths. The forts, temples and havelis that dot the landscape are all brought to vivid life through the visuals and meticulously researched vignettes. In a reverential touch, we “collect” the waters of the Ganga to offer at the centuries-old home of poet-saint Tulsidas, where we stop next. While we are Zooming together, there is constant interaction among the group. There are quizzes to answer and tangential questions to explore, just as on the physical walk, and I discover new facets of the city. The mood is lively, the chatter congenial, and I log off, having re-immersed myself in the essence of Varanasi.

Rathi and his wife Anchal co-founded Roobaroo in 2015, and as travel ground to a halt this year, they decided to roll with the punches and reimagine their enterprise. Their pivot from operating in the fully physical realm to the virtual in just a few months tells a tale of quickly harnessed panic, and the consequent upskilling and reinventing to stay in the game.

Staying relevant

The transformation under way in this sector is reaffirmed by Arjun Bhat, founder/ storyteller at Explore Hampi. “We were running tours right till mid-March and were completely unprepared for what was to follow,” he says. But the passion and toil with which he founded his enterprise in 2014 made him determined to “stay relevant, stay alive and keep the dream going”. A sneak-peek of an upcoming virtual tour centred around Krishadevaraya, the mighty king of Vijayanagara, shows a meticulously researched, in-depth structure that combines music, videos and 360° images with live narration as travellers “walk” through Hampi.

Detailing the upskilling tasks of the past few months, Bhat says, “Learning the use of different tools, platforms, media types, software and technology has been challenging. A lot of work has gone into doing primary research and creating new content. Marketing and customer acquisition for this format are completely new to us and we are trying to figure it out as we go along.”

The virtual world has unexpected advantages too. For one, structuring a tour is easier, according to Bhat. Various media elements can be used to emphasise a point and physical limitations on narrative flow are no longer a concern. Participant time constraints can also be managed better. Although virtual tours are priced lower, they still include quality access to the storyteller, which can increase trust and enthuse participants to try their physical walks later, as Rathi says.

Future is here

As in the physical world, the virtual tours too focus on the storyteller’s unique geographical areas of expertise. Roobaroo has an upcoming tour on the Ramlila, while Explore Hampi will have one on Kishkinda tales. Immersive Trails, a walking tour enterprise in Kolkata, offers a virtual Durga Puja trail tour. One can also choose a cooking class in Rome or a walking tour of Madrid from the global experiences on offer.

The contours of how we travel are being reshaped by this pandemic, but these storytellers are ensuring the essence stays the same and the nuances are not lost in translation. Rathi says that virtual tours will stay on as part of their offerings even when physical travel resumes, to attract more participants. Bhat expects footfalls to return to pre-pandemic levels only after 18-24 months. He believes that “revenge travel,” a pandemic coinage to indicate the rush of tourists anticipated once restrictions ease, is unlikely, given the recessionary economy. In this altered reality, as he says, the ones left standing will be those who “innovate, pivot, reinvent themselves and survive.” Until we can ride a coracle on the Tungabhadra again, we must learn to love the virtual river.

Republican Senator David Perdue mocked Kamala Harris, his Senate colleague and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, by repeatedly mispronouncing her name at a Georgia rally for President Donald Trump.

Mr. Perdue on Friday was wrapping up his remarks at an event in Macon when he referred to Harris as “KAH’-mah-lah? Kah-MAH’-lah? Kamala-mala-mala? I don’t know. Whatever.” The audience laughed.

A spokesperson for Mr. Perdue said the first-term senator didn’t mean anything by it. Ms. Harris’ political opponents have repeatedly mispronounced her name since she became the first Black woman on a major party ticket, a trend many Democrats say smacks of racism.

35,2020/10/17,Lightning Logistics to grow EV fleet,"Shreyas Shibulal, son of Infosys co-founder S.D. Shibulal, has drawn up plans to expand the fleet capacity of Lightning Logistics, a pure play electric vehicle last-mile delivery firm, over the next two years.

“Lightning Logistics was started in 2018 under the EV-focussed venture Micelio,” said Mr. Shibulal, founder, Micelio Mobility. “It is in a pilot stage with a fleet of about 1,000 EVs.

“We are planning to add 1,000 EVs next year and another 2,000 the following year. We are developing our own two-wheeler for last-mile logistics. Details will be revealed at a later stage,” he said. Lightning Logistics provides businesses with a bike and rider for doorstep deliveries.

The product development team of Micelio is working on EV last-mile logistics and EV form factor for logistics vehicle, he said. “The EVs we are using right now are procured off-the-shelf and they haven’t been made for last-mile logistics purposes. Going forward, we will have our own EVs produced by our product company. The first vehicle will be delivered by mid-next year. It is meant for B2B customers.”

“From a look and feel perspective, it may look quite similar to what you’re used to from a two-wheeler. But the idea here is that it would be used for EV last-mile logistics. We want to build a vehicle that would outperform anything else that’s out there in the market for EV last-mile logistics,” he said.

Asked about the location and investment, he said that they were yet to freeze on the location. The funding will come from his personal wealth. Mr. Shreyas owns little less than 1% stake in Infosys Ltd. and said he did not want to go public or dilute his stake at least for the next two years.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lightning-logistics-to-grow-ev-fleet/article32883004.ece
36,2020/10/17,Competitive to make in India: Schwing Stetter MD,"‘Workforce availability, transportation key advantages’

Schwing Stetter, a leading manufacturer and supplier of construction equipment, is planning to move some of its European operations to India. The Indian subsidiary of the German firm is investing ₹350 crore in phases in its new unit and will start exporting products back to European countries, managing director V.G. Sakthikumar said in an interview. Edited excerpts:

What are your plans in India?

We are constructing a new factory at Sipcot, Cheyyar. It is in the final stages of completion. Civil works will be through by October; installation of machines will take two more months and it will be ready for operations by January 2021.

What products are to be made there?

We are moving out certain product range (fabrications from Austria) and assembly (new product range) from Germany to India.

Some of the key products are concrete boom pumps, separate placing booms, shotcrete pumps, self loading mixers and other concrete trailer pumps.

Apart from these products, the group company will also manufacture three models of hydraulic excavators.

It is 25% more competitive to make these products in India and we have the workforce to make these products and an efficient Chennai Port for transportation. Initially, the new unit will add 10-15% of export turnover.

As we move forward, one-third of the turnover will come from this factory. We also got a major breakthrough by moving certain products to eastern Europe. Our traditional markets are from New Zealand to Africa. We also got some orders from Germany and U.S. The new unit will cater to the needs of domestic and export markets.

What is the investment

At the moment, we have incurred ₹200 crore. We plan to spend another ₹100 crore. Some of the machinery have started coming. Starting January, the products to be shifted will move from batch production to assembly line.

What is your turnover and backlog?

In the year 2018 (January to December), we made ₹2,050 crore. This came down to ₹1,730 crore in 2019. We are expecting ₹1,450 crore-₹1,500 crore for 2020, of which exports will be ₹150 crore (₹100 crore). Our orders dried up during COVID-19 to ₹100 crore and it now stands at ₹250 crore.

Have you reached pre-COVID-19 levels?

If you compare our performance in August 2020 vs 2019, we have done better. During August, our turnover was more than that of 2019 and we did 80%-85% of pre-COVID-19 levels. But in September 2020, we crossed last September’s volumes and also pre-COVID-19 levels. Going forward, October also looks good with strong order book position.

How do you compare the year 2020 with 2019?

The first two months of 2020 were better than the previous year due to more projects. 2018 was a better year and 2019 was one of slowdown. The industry witnessed a decline of 30% in 2019, whereas we reported a 15% drop. The current year has only three more months left. The industry will achieve 75% of 2019’s production, while we will be ahead of the industry at 80%.

Right now, we are slowing down and expanding our capacity in tune with market conditions. During 2021, we will be adding machinery and de-bottlenecking our facility.

What is the forecast for the following two years?

The next two years will be the best period for infrastructure sector with lots of projects in the pipeline. Orders are expected from roads, railways, real estate, windmill and solar. We expect the industry to grow by 10-15% for next two years.

What is your product localisation level?

Whatever we are doing has 90% local content. For the new unit, the import content will be high and it will be slowly brought down.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/z0ujb6/article32882987.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THBUSakthikumar,https://www.thehindu.com/business/competitive-to-make-in-india-schwing-stetter-md/article32882988.ece

40,2020/10/17,"CRPF, IIT-Delhi and DRDO sign MoU","It will enable officers to undertake short-term specialised courses and also pursue research work

The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has signed an agreement with the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to create a pool of officials who will work to find technology solutions for its operational challenges.

The about 3.25 lakh-strong force has about 500 officers and sub-officers who hold professional degrees in engineering and technology.

The Memorandum of Understanding will enable these officers to undertake short-term specialised courses at these institutions and also pursue research work.

“A batch of 40 engineering graduate officers and subordinate officers of the CRPF with right aptitude and potential will undergo a certificate course of about three to six months under IIT-Delhi’'s continuing education programme”, a CRPF spokesperson said.

“This will equip them with unique skills, capabilities and knowledge to tackle complex challenges, meet operational and strategic needs and enhance competitive advantage”, he stated.

Tech advisors

A selected group of officers from this trained batch would undergo higher degree courses at IIT-Delhi. They would act as tech advisors to the force, he noted.

The chosen officials would be associated with joint research projects undertaken by the DRDO and IIT-Delhi in defence and security technology solutions. The first batch was expected to undertake courses and research work in ballistics, building and infrastructure, information technology and communication, he added.

41,2020/10/17,Chirag Paswan | In a race to be kingmaker,"The LJP leader is on a mission to unseat Nitish Kumar while ensuring BJP wins

The Bihar Assembly election, scheduled to begin later this month, is no longer a bipolar contest between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Opposition United Progressive Alliance (UPA), thanks to Chirag Paswan, president of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). The 37-year-old walked away from the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led NDA in Bihar, while at the same time continuing to support the BJP.

If the LJP successfully cuts into the Janata Dal(U)’s vote share and seat tally without affecting the BJP’s performance, the State, for the first time, could see a BJP Chief Minister. This is a scenario that Mr. Chirag claims to be working for. On the other side, the Opposition Mahagatbandhan (grand alliance), led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), is hoping to gain from the divisions within the NDA.

On October 4, four days after the LJP announced its decision to go solo, party patriarch and Mr. Chirag’s father Ram Vilas Paswan died of a prolonged illness, leaving the son in charge of the party’s election tactics. The LJP had seen a smooth transfer of power between the father and the son, something the senior Paswan was proud of. On November 5 last year, he handed over the reins of the party to Mr. Chirag. He often cited the bitter political feud between Mulayam Singh and son Akhilesh Singh Yadav when the latter took over the Samajwadi Party. The warmth between the two Paswans was visible and often advertised. During the lockdown, a video of the son giving the father a shave was circulated by the party. The two sat for interviews together.

Dalit Sena

Mr. Chirag’s first appearance at a political event was as a one-year-old sitting on his mother’s lap during the launch of the Dalit Sena in 1983. Ram Vilas Paswan built the LJP 17 years later on the foundations laid by the Sena.

Born to a Bihari father and Punjabi mother (Reena Sharma Paswan), Mr. Chirag is part Punjabi and part Bihari, though, it is the latter part that he wants the world to concentrate on. To assert his Bihari identity, he recently changed his social media name to ‘Yuva Bihari Chirag Paswan’.

He did his schooling from the Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute in the Army Cantonment area in Delhi. Later, he joined Amity University for the B.Tech. Computer Science programme, but left it mid-way. In Mr. Chirag’s own words, his friends, impressed by his “good looks”, prodded him to go to Mumbai to try his luck in Bollywood.

By 2002, he was travelling between Delhi and Mumbai, training to be an actor. In 2010, Miley Naa Miley Hum, his only film, co-starring Kangana Ranaut, was released. Three-years later, well in time for the 2014 Lok Sabha poll, Mr. Chirag was back in Bihar.

He is often nostalgic about his foray into the Bollywood. “There was a very famous song from my movie, “Katto Gilehri...”, written by Javed Sahab [lyricist Javed Akhtar], that happens to be a popular song in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. So when I go out at times, they sing the song, the youth tell me that I look good, and I must make another movie, but politics is a full-time and the only job for me,” he told The Hindu in 2019.

His entry into politics meant a new chapter for the LJP. In March 2014, he steered his father towards Narendra Modi, 12 years after the senior Paswan quit the NDA, criticising Mr. Modi over the Gujarat riots.

“My father was my best friend. While everyone else in the party was scared to tell him their minds about joining hands with Modiji, I could easily talk, argue and goad him,” Mr Paswan later said. While his father struggled to justify the switch, Mr. Chirag had no such qualms. Questions on Mr. Modi’s “secular credentials” were deflected by listing out the 1984 anti-Sikh riots or the 1989 Bhagalpur riots, among others.

He is his father’s son when it comes to handling interviews. When he took over last November, the question that was repeatedly asked was about dynasty politics and nepotism. He was candid enough to concede that this is a “Nepo-Kid”, a term popularised by his co-star, Kangana Ranaut. “Our struggle begins where it ends for others. For anyone, getting elected to the Assembly or Parliament suffices. For us, it is considered that we will be elected. Our struggle is to get re-elected again and again,” Mr. Paswan said.

In many other ways, he is a world apart from his father. The father revelled in his company. 12 Janpath, his residence for 31 years, was an open house for supporters, party workers, distant relatives, acquaintances and journalists. The son prefers to keep to his close circle.

In 2005, Ram Vilas Paswan played a key role in changing the political course of Bihar.

He walked out of the RJD-Congress alliance, and the LJP contested against the RJD but not against the Congress. The gamble paid off, as it brought an end to the 15-year rule of Lalu Prasad.

In the election held in February 2005, the LJP got 29 seats. This led to a hung house and fresh election in which Nitish Kumar swept to power. Mr. Chirag wants history to repeat in 2020.

The difference, however, is that this time, Mr. Kumar could be at the receiving end.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5m4x9b/article32882896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHIRAG-PASWAN1111,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chirag-paswan-in-a-race-to-be-kingmaker/article32882897.ece
42,2020/10/17,India resumes import of potatoes from Bhutan,"They were stopped because of growing number of COVID-19 cases

India on Saturday threw open its domestic market for certain agricultural commodities including potatoes from Bhutan. The decision is expected to help a large number of Bhutanese traders as India had stopped the import just days earlier because of growing number of COVID-19 cases in the Bhutanese territory near the border.

“A significant milestone has been achieved today in bilateral trade relations between India and Bhutan, opening new market access for areca nut, mandarin, apple, potato and ginger from Bhutan. Agriculture being an important sector in the economy of both countries, this decision to allow market access for these agricultural commodities was arrived at after detailed deliberations between the National Plant Protection Organisation, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, the government of India, the Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests, the Royal Government of Bhutan and the Embassy of India, Thimphu,’ the Indian embassy said.

Indian markets in the east and the northeast have received Bhutanese potatoes in the past. It is not clear why the embassy included it in the list of “new market access”.

India’s envoy Ruchira Kamboj described the move as part of fulfilling a key commitment to grow bilateral trade. The trade was disrupted after the Indian border trade hub of Jaigaon stopped the import citing COVID-19 cases in Phuentsholing. The Indian decision is likely to help dozens of traders on the Bhutanese side who had a large number of trucks stranded after Jaigaon stopped trade.

The official statement from India promised to “extend all possible support to Bhutan to minimise the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/429atb/article32882627.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POTATO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-resumes-import-of-potatoes-from-bhutan/article32882628.ece
43,2020/10/17,"Changes to J&K Panchayat Act drops payments to panches, sarpanches","MHA amends 1989 Act on honorarium for elected officials

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has amended the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayati Raj Act, 1989, omitting a provision requiring payment of honorarium to panches and sarpanches (village head) in the newly created Union Territory. The amended law also says that Halqa Panchayat shall be required to get its accounts audited by a chartered accountant every year. Halqa means the area comprising a village or contiguous number of villages determined by the government.

Section 10 of the 1989 Act on “remuneration to Sarpanch and Panches,” which said every Sarpanch and Panch shall be entitled to such monthly honorarium as may be specified by the government, has been omitted through an order issued by the MHA on Saturday. Currently, a sarpanch and panch get ₹3,000 and ₹1,000 as honorarium respectively.

A senior J&K government official told The Hindu that the omission will not affect the remuneration and the panches will continue to get paid.

“The section has been removed for administrative flexibility, so that when the government wants it can increase the honorarium without amending the whole Act. For now, every time it has to be increased, the Act will have to be amended,” said the official.

Also read: Analysis | Change at Jammu and Kashmir helm amid uneasy security situation

J&K has been under central rule since June 2018. The special status of the erstwhile State under Article 370 was revoked in August 2019 by the Parliament and it was downgraded and bifurcated into two Union Territories, J&K and Ladakh. The J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019 enables MHA to amend the Union Territory’s laws by issuing an order.

The panchayat elections were held in the former State of J&K in 2018 and as many as 12,776 vacant sarpanch and panch seats, particularly in South Kashmir are still vacant as elections couldn’t be held due to security concerns then. A total of 27,281 panches and sarpanches were elected then.

The amended provisions of the 1989 Act say that the Halqa Panchayat may employ necessary staff for carrying out duties but “Halqa Panchayat shall pay remuneration to such staff out of its own resources.”

The amendment also paves way for creation of District Development Councils in the Union Territory (UT). The DDCs will have jurisdiction over the entire district excluding those areas designated as municipality or municipal corporation.

“Every district will be divided into 14 territorial constituencies to elect members for the body. The DDC shall consist of the directly elected members from territorial constituencies in the district, members of the Legislative Assembly representing a part or whole of the district whose constituencies lie within the district and the Chairperson of all Block Development Councils of the district,” the order, issued after the amendments, reads.

“All members of the DDC, whether or not elected by direct election from territorial constituencies in the district, shall have the right to vote in the meeting of the District Development Council,” reads the amendments.

“But the MLAs will have no voting rights in the case of election or removal of the Chairman and vice-chairman only the directly elected members shall have the right to vote,"" it added.

Valley parties wary

J&K parties are wary of the centre's move and expressed apprehension over reducing the role of MLAs.

“They (the Centre) empower everyone and everything that’s against the idea of political empowerment. This is a step towards uprooting politics in the name of development. If the Centre is sincere, why has it taken away the right to legislate?” Peoples Democratic Party leader Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra said.

Shafiq Mir, the chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference, said, “The move will have an Assembly member just a spectator in the DDC meeting. He will not have any say.”

A National Conference (NC) spokesman said the party was studying the amendments made to the Panchayati Act and “will come up with an informed response soon”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hz9e3e/article32882585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/changes-to-jk-panchayat-act-drops-payments-to-panches/article32882586.ece
44,2020/10/17,Supreme Court takes suo motu note of Chardham Chairman’s letter,"He conveys distress at Centre’s “wilful non-compliance” to fiat on building full-fledged roads

The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of a letter by Chardham High-Powered Committee (HPC) Chairman Ravi Chopra about the Centre’s “willful non-compliance” to comply with an apex court order against building full-fledged roads cutting across the fragile Himalayan slopes.

The project includes developing highways in Uttarakhand to improve access to the four shrines — Yamunotri, Gangotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath.

On September 8, a Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman had ordered the Centre to adhere to a March 23, 2018 circular of the Ministry of Roads, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) and reduce the width of the roads to 5.5m from 12m. The court had ordered the Centre to plant trees in “right earnest” to recover the green cover ‘devastated’ by construction.

When the Centre had argued that the 2018 circular would apply only for future projects and not the Chardham, the court had reminded it that Chardham was still an ‘ongoing’ project. The Justice Nariman Bench had observed that the 2018 circular would indeed apply for Chardham considering the “current situation” of the fragile mountain terrain.

However, Mr. Chopra conveyed his distress at the Centre’s attitude in his letter on October 5.

“Till date no plan or approach to bring the Chardham Pariyojana roads in compliance with the Supreme Court’s order of September 8 has been submitted,” Mr. Chopra wrote to the court.

The case is likely to come up for hearing on October 26.

Mr. Chopra said he had written to the MoRTH to comply with the court order, to suspend cutting of trees and provide the HPC with a copy of the Rapid Environmental Impact Assessment (REIA) report submitted by the consultant. He had also sought a complete list of vulnerable slopes and muck dumps with work plans for their sustainable rehabilitation. He said all he got after several days was a draft report and an incomplete list of muck dumps dating back to May 11.

He informed the court about news reports and photographs of fresh hill and tree cutting, and even notifications for toll plazas.

He said he had received contradictory versions on the width of the roads being built, with one officer saying it would be 12m for areas where hill-cutting has already been done.

He quoted news reports saying the MoRTH’s 2018 circular would be “applicable only to the proposed 13 projects where work had not yet begun”.

The letter said the HPC was committed, despite pandemic conditions, to ensure that “safe and comfortable highways can be constructed without damage to the Himalayas”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m3fafx/article32753866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-takes-suo-motu-note-of-chardham-chairmans-letter/article32882396.ece
45,2020/10/17,76% of rural Indians can’t afford a nutritious diet: study,"Paper uses latest available food price and wage information from the National Sample Survey’s 2011 dataset.

Three out of four rural Indians cannot afford a nutritious diet, according to a paper recently published in journal Food Policy. Even if they spent their entire income on food, almost two out of three of them would not have the money to pay for the cheapest possible diet that meets the requirements set by the government’s premier nutrition body, it says.

Also read: India fares poorly in hunger index

Unlike the Economic Survey’s Thalinomics, which provided a rosier picture of meal costs, this study uses the wages of unskilled workers who make up a larger proportion of the population than industrial workers, and includes items such as dairy, fruit and dark green leafy vegetables that are essential as per India’s official dietary guidelines.

Also read: The Hindu Explains | How did the National Institute of Nutrition arrive at the ‘ideal’ weight of Indian men and women?

The paper, titled Affordability of nutritious diets in rural India, is authored by International Food Policy Research Institute economist Kalyani Raghunathan and others, and uses the latest available food price and wage information from the National Sample Survey’s 2011 dataset.

The findings are significant in the light of the fact that India performs abysmally on many nutrition indicators even while the country claims to have achieved food security. On Friday, the Global Hunger Index showed that India has the world’s highest prevalence of child wasting, reflecting acute undernutrition. On indicators that simply measure calorie intake, India performs relatively better, but they do not account for the nutrition value of those calories.

The National Institute for Nutrition’s guidelines for a nutritionally adequate diet call for adult women to eat 330 gm of cereals and 75 gm of pulses a day, along with 300 gm of dairy, 100 gm of fruit, and 300 gm of vegetables, which should include at least 100 gm of dark green leafy vegetables. Selecting the cheapest options from actual Indian diets -- wheat, rice, bajra, milk, curd, onions, radish, spinach, bananas -- the study calculated that a day’s meals would cost ₹45 (or ₹51 for an adult man).

Even if they spent all their income on food, 63.3% of the rural population or more than 52 crore Indians would not be able to afford that nutritious meal. If they set aside just a third of their income for non-food expenses, 76% of rural Indians would not be able to afford the recommended diet. This does not even account for the meals of non-earning members of a household, such as children or older adults.

“These numbers are somewhat speculative, but they do reveal the scale of the dietary affordability problem in rural India: nutritious diets are too expensive, and incomes far too low,” says the paper.

Although their data ended in 2011, since when both food prices and wages have risen, the study’s authors recommended that the government develop a similar tool to monitor dietary costs and affordability of nutritious meals. Currently, food costs are measured through consumer price indices (CPIs) which weight foods by expenditure shares. “In poor countries such as India, CPIs are heavily weighted towards nutrient-sparse starchy staples, meaning that trends in the food CPI can be misleading from a nutritional standpoint,” said the paper.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/s4jma0/article32742848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NUTRITIONMONTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/76-of-rural-indians-cant-afford-a-nutritious-diet-study/article32881678.ece

The Railway workers union has threatened of ‘direct action’ if their productivity linked bonus, which is usually paid before the onset of Durga Puja, is not released by October 20.

This was decided in a virtual standing committee meeting of the All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF) held on Friday.

AIRF general secretary Shiv Gopal Mishra said railwaymen worked 24X7 during the COVID-19 pandemic but the government was ignoring this “legitimate” demand of the railway employees.

“It was decided in the meeting that if orders for payment of productivity linked bonus to railwaymen are not issued by the Railway Ministry by October 20, direct action shall be taken on October 22, 2020,” he said.

The file related to the bonus has been sent by the Railway Board (Ministry of Railways) to the Finance Ministry, which is not clearing it and adopting an indifferent attitude in this regard, Mr. Mishra claimed.

He said the payment used to be made before Durga Puja but this time it has not been done so far, resulting in serious resentment and unrest amongst the railwaymen.

In the meeting, officials also expressed anguish over anti-labour policies of the government and demanded direct action.

The meeting also raised issues regarding the privatisation/outsourcing and corporatisation in the Railways, restoration of the old pension scheme, and releasing of dearness allowance/dearness relief.

The board’s general secretary said that during the meeting, it was also decided to form Save Railway-Save Nation Campaign Committees at all 7,600 railway stations across the country.

He demanded that local rail users and other prominent personalities be involved in the formation of the said committees to create an effective atmosphere to halt the policies of privatisation and corporatisation in the Indian Railways.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/n9z0h/article32881661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAILWAYWORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/railway-union-calls-for-direct-action-if-productivity-linked-bonus-not-paid-by-october-20/article32881662.ece

48,2020/10/17,BJP dares Congress to mention Art 370 restoration in its Bihar poll manifesto,"Whatever be the issue, the Congress praises Pakistan and China, he alleged while taking a swipe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

A day after the Congress pitched for restoration of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP Saturday dared it to say so in its manifesto for the Bihar assembly polls and accused it of speaking the language of “separatists”.

Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar accused the Congress of practising the politics of “dividing society” for collecting votes ahead of the Bihar polls, which begin from October 28, and asserted that people have supported the government’s move on Jammu and Kashmir.

“People have seen how much progress has happened in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Still, the Congress is singing the tune of whatever few separatists are there. The Congress has become a narrow party and that is why it is taking stand against the sentiments of people in the country,” he told reporters.

Whatever be the issue, the Congress praises Pakistan and China, he alleged while taking a swipe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

The entire country has hailed the government’s move to revoke Article 370, he said.

Congress leader P Chidambaram had said on Friday that his party resolutely stands for restoration of the status and rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and that the “arbitrary and unconstitutional” decisions of the Modi government of August 5, 2019 must be rescinded.

The government had last year nullified Article 370, which had given special rights to the region, and divided the state into two union territories.

BJP president J P Nadda had attacked the Congress for its stand and tweeted Friday night, “Since Congress has no good governance agenda to talk about, they are back to their ‘Divide India’ dirty tricks before Bihar elections. Shri Rahul Gandhi praises Pakistan and Shri Chidambaram says Congress wants Article 370 to return! Shameful!”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2loki4/article32881348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRAKASHJAVADEKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-dares-congress-to-mention-art-370-restoration-in-its-bihar-poll-manifesto/article32881349.ece

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called for full preparedness to ensure speedy access to COVID-19 vaccines for every citizen.

Chairing a meeting to review the pandemic situation in the country, Mr. Modi directed that every step in the logistics, delivery and administration of the vaccine should be put in place rigorously and it must include advanced planning of cold storage chains, distribution network, monitoring mechanism, advance assessment and preparation of ancillary equipment such as vials and syringes, according to a release issued by the government.

The Prime Minister’s instructions came on a day India reported an active caseload of below 8 lakh for the first time after one-and-a-half months.

“The positive cases are 7,95,087 while 70,816 patients have recovered and been discharged in the last 24 hours whereas the new confirmed cases are 62,212. Maharashtra contributes more than 13,000 to the single day recoveries followed by Karnataka with more than 8,000. 837 case fatalities have been reported in the past 24 hours. Of these, nearly 82% are concentrated in 10 States/UTs with Maharashtra reporting the maximum — 306,’’ said the Health Ministry.

The PM, on Saturday, reviewed the pandemic situation and the preparedness of vaccine delivery, distribution and administration at a meeting attended by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and officials.

The meeting noted that three vaccines are at advanced stages of development in India, of which two are in Phase II and one is in Phase-III.

“Indian scientists and research teams are collaborating and strengthening the research capacities in neighbouring countries viz., Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal and Sri Lanka. There are further requests from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Qatar and Bhutan for clinical trials in their countries. To help the global community, the Prime Minister further directed that we should not limit our efforts to our immediate neighbourhood but also reach out to the entire world in providing vaccines, medicines and IT platforms for the vaccine delivery system,’’ said the release.

It said the national expert group on vaccine administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) in consultation with State governments and all stakeholders has presented a detailed blueprint of vaccine storage, distribution and administration. The Expert Group in consultation with the States is working actively on vaccine prioritisation and distribution.

The PM has further directed that India should make use of experience of successful conduct of elections and disaster management.

“The Prime Minister said that in a similar manner vaccine delivery and administration systems should be put in place.

Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates, has met with the representatives of a Hindu organisation building the community’s first temple in Abu Dhabi and reviewed its progress.

The foundation stone of the temple was laid in April last year and work started from December.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the voice of the farmers was gagged in Parliament but it will now resonate in the Punjab Assembly and echo in every part of the country till the Central government is compelled to withdraw the farm laws.

The Punjab government has decided to convene a special session of the Assembly on October 19 to bring in a legislation to counter them. Mr. Gandhi, along with Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, kickstarted the second phase of the Smart Village Campaign (SVC) with the virtual launch of a ₹2,775-crore campaign to power the rural transformation. He said if farm laws were in the interest of the farmers, why did the BJP-led government not allow a debate on them in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.

In June 1971, a young Member of Parliament stood up to initiate a discussion, calling for the Government of India to accord diplomatic recognition to the Bangladesh government-in exile based in the Bangladeshi town of Mujibnagar that functioned as the provisional government, while its leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was in a Karachi prison.

The MP, 36-year-old Pranab Mukherjee, spoke at length about the precedents to intervention in world history, and the brutal atrocities being carried out in Bangladesh that necessitated Indian action.

“I am talking of a political solution which means categorically recognising the sovereign democratic government of Bangladesh. Political solution means giving material help to the democratic, sovereign government of Bangladesh,” he said.

Anthology of essays

The speech and his memories of 1971 and the liberation war of Bangladesh are in one of the last long articles the former President completed before he died in August last, a part of an anthology of essays in honour of the birth centenary year of Mujib, as Bangladesh’s founding father is known.

The book, called Voice of Millions, was published earlier this year but is yet to be launched formally. What makes the essay more poignant is that Mukherjee was due to address another session of Bangladesh Parliament, this time a Special Session on March 22-23 to mark the Mujib centenary, and also to attend the book’s launch. However, the functions in Dhaka were put off due to the coronavirus pandemic, and when they are held, the former MP, Minister and President will not be a part of them.

According to the editors of the book, Mukherjee was the only foreign dignitary asked to contribute, and he readily agreed to their request.

“Mr. Mukherjee was invited to contribute to the book as a ‘family member’ of the Prime Minister,” explained Asif Kabir, part of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman centenary committee, referring to the close relationship he shared with Mujib’s daughter and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Mukherjee’s private secretary, Abhijeet Rai, said the essay, which was the last extensive piece penned by the late President, needed considerable research on Mujib’s life and political career and Mukherjee drew from Mujib’s own Unfinished Memoirs that were published years after his death by Ms. Hasina. Mujib was freed only after the Pakistan army surrendered in Dhaka in December 1971, and as recorded by Mukherjee, for many days he was kept unaware of the incidents, while Pakistan’s soon to be President, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, attempted to negotiate with him. Eventually, Bhutto gave up and Mujib returned to a triumphant welcome in Dhaka with a brief stopover in Delhi to thank Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for India’s support.

In later years, when Ms. Hasina was in exile herself and lived in Delhi with her family, it was Mukherjee and his wife Suvra Mukherjee, who had lived in East Bengal before Partition, who became their closest friends.

“It’s so hard to lose one’s parents even when they have a natural death,” said Mukherjee’s daughter and Congress leader Sharmishtha Mukherjee. “It is unimaginable what Sheikh Hasina has gone through, and I think the bond between her and my parents was stronger because she needed emotional support at the time.”

Bangladesh is all set to resume flights to India from October 28 under ‘air bubble’ arrangement, nearly eight months after communications were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to media reports on Saturday.

Under a bilateral air bubble pact, airlines of both the countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions.

Since July, India has established such bubbles with several countries, including the US, the UK, France and Germany.

Three Bangladeshi carriers - Biman Bangladeshi Airlines, US-Bangla Airlines and Novo Air - would initially operate 28 flights a week, while five Indian airlines -- Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet, Vistara and GoAir -- would operate 28 flights a week between the two countries, The Daily Star reported, quoting civil aviation and tourism ministry Senior Secretary Md Mohibul Haque.

Of the three Bangladeshi carriers, Biman is scheduled to operate flights on Dhaka-Delhi and Dhaka-Kolkata routes, US-Bangla Airlines on Dhaka-Chennai and Novo Air on Dhaka-Kolkata route, the report said.

The five Indian airlines are expected to operate flights on Dhaka-Delhi, Dhaka-Kolkata, Dhaka-Chennai and Dhaka-Mumbai routes.

The decision to resume flights to India was made at an inter-ministerial meeting at the civil aviation and tourism ministry on Friday, the report said.

The resumption of air communications will bring relief to many Bangladeshis who are waiting to travel to the neighbouring country for treatment, it said.

According to a report in The Dhaka Tribune, from January 2018 to March 2019, at least 2,876,000 Bangladeshis visited India, and on average 10 per cent of them went for medical treatment.

Initially, around 5,000 passengers from both the countries would be able to fly each week, the report quoted Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) Chairman Air Vice Marshal M. Mafidur Rahman as saying.

COVID testing

There is no transit facility for the passengers to fly to a third country, he said, adding that the passengers would have to undergo COVID-19 testing before flying.

On October 9, the Indian High Commission in Bangladesh announced resumption of online visa application services for Bangladeshi citizens.

For now, visas will be provided in nine categories, including medical, business, employment, journalists and diplomats.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r0o94b/article32359058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bangladesh-to-resume-flights-to-india-from-october-28-under-air-bubble-arrangement/article32880579.ece

57,2020/10/17,ED asked to expedite Sanjay Bhandari’s extradition,"U.K.-based arms dealer has been chargesheeted for tax evasion

Taking cognisance of a chargesheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, the companies controlled by him and and his associates, a Special Court has directed the agency to expedite the extradition process pending against him in the United Kingdom.

The ED case is based on a complaint filed by the Income-Tax Department under the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015. It is alleged that Mr. Bhandari had stashed ill-gotten wealth overseas to evade taxes.

According to the agency, Mr. Bhandari owned assets in various foreign jurisdictions and had set up multiple entities in the United Arab Emirates. He also had financial interests in an entity registered in Panama. The foreign assets were not disclosed to the Income-Tax authorities.

The ED alleges that Mr. Bhandari changed his shareholding pattern in the overseas companies, including Offset India Solutions FZC (later named Offset Solutions FZE), Santech International FZC, and Shamlan Gros-1 INC.

The accused maintained a foreign bank account in the name of Serra Dues Technologies, whose share capital was allegedly held by Wenham Major Limited as custodian, and subsequently transferred to one WWFL World Wide Holdings Limited. He also had 33.3% shares in Petro Global Technologies Limited (UAE), and was the beneficial owner of Vertex Management Holdings Limited from December 2009 to November 2012, the ED alleges.

The agency has identified at least two undisclosed assets in the UAE and London. Mr. Bhandari was trying to project that the foreign assets were held by him in fiduciary capacity as a trustee of some trust and for this purpose, Alrahma Trust (UAE) was identified by his associates. The accused tried to change the trust’s structure with retrospective effect using forged documents.

Mr. Bhandari had hired a Chartered Accountant, Sanjeev Kapoor, also mentioned in the chargesheet, at whose instance the former chose the UAE-based trust for managing the assets without detection. Mr. Kapoor allegedly identified Alrahma Trust through a client. He went to the UAE in July 2016 to meet the settler, and coordinated the payment of fee for making Mr. Bhandari a trustee.

In February 2017, the Chartered Accountant met Mr. Bhandari and one Sumit Chadha in the U.K. for the same purpose, the agency has alleged.

Through a separate application, the ED had earlier urged the court to declare Mr. Bhandari a fugitive under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act. This will facilitate the confiscation of his assets if he does not turn up in person to face legal proceedings.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-asked-to-expedite-sanjay-bhandaris-extradition/article32877634.ece
58,2020/10/17,ED attaches assets of kin of terror outfit leader,"In a terror funding case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached assets worth ₹4.23 crore of Shelly N. Sumi and others. Shelly is the wife of Nikki Sumi, the alleged deputy commander-in-chief of National Socialist Council of Nagaland–Khaplang (NSCN-K).

The attached assets are in the form of houses, a vehicle and bank balance.

The ED investigation is based on a charge sheet filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against Ms. Sumi and others. She and her associates were intercepted by the Assam Rifles when they were on their way to the Myanmar headquarters of NSCN(K) via Imphal.

The main accused was carrying over ₹18.47 lakh in cash, which was to be handed over to her husband. Further searches by the NIA led to the seizure of more than ₹27.90 lakh.

The ED alleges that NSCN(K), a banned terror outfit, extorted funds from government employees, businessmen and others. “Shelly Sumi and her associates were involved in the criminal conspiracy to transfer funds to NSCN(K) via the Indo-Myanmar border,” said the agency.

Ms. Sumi is a government employee and works as a section assistant with the Public Works Department in Nagaland, on a salary of about ₹28,000, which is the only legal income of the family of seven.

However, the ED found that the family members had allegedly amassed huge assets in the form of a palatial house at Dimapur, Nagaland, worth ₹3.6 crore, a vehicle, and another house in Zunheboto. Their bank accounts were also identified.

“The properties created in the name of Shelly Sumi and her children was acquired without any reasonable source of income and from the illegally extorted money by terror activities,” the agency said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-attaches-assets-of-kin-of-terror-outfit-leader/article32877632.ece
59,2020/10/17,‘Move to delist some categories from updated NRC is contempt of SC’,"Congress says NRC authorities did not obtain permission from court to issue the directive

The opposition Congress in Assam has said the move to delist certain categories of people from the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) was tantamount to “contempt of the Supreme Court.”

State Coordinator for NRC, Hitesh Dev Sarma, had on October 13 asked deputy commissioners and district registrars of citizen registration to prepare a list of “ineligible” people belonging to the “categories of DF/DV/PFT” and their descendants who have been included in the complete NRC published on August 31, 2019.

DF, DV and PFT expand to declared foreigners, doubtful voters and pending in Foreigners’ Tribunals (FTs).

Congress MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Debabrata Saikia, on Friday said the NRC authorities did not obtain permission from the Supreme Court to issue the directive.

The apex court had monitored the exercise of updating the NRC of 1951.

“An earnest desire of the people of Assam was fulfilled when the NRC was updated under the supervision of the Supreme Court and, as such, both the Central and State governments share a responsibility towards the NRC. However, news has been published that the incumbent NRC State Coordinator has instructed various district magistrates to prepare a list of D-voters, persons facing trial in FTs, children younger than 14 years who have one parent of dubious nationality, and the like,” Mr. Saikia said.

He said the NRC State Coordinator’s directive was tantamount to contempt of the Supreme Court as he had not taken the court’s leave to do so. “The apex court did not pass any order regarding omission or inclusion of fresh names in the final NRC,” he added.

Mr. Saikia urged the State government to start the process of final NRC appeals, which was supposed to start within 120 days of publication of the document but remained on hold for more than a year.

“Emphasis should be on the inclusion of the names of local inhabitants whose names did not appear in the NRC because they never applied for enrolment,” he said.

On Thursday, the Forum for Protection of Indian Citizenship Rights had made a similar observation. It also alluded to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal’s statement at a public function on October 10 that the NRC was erroneous.

“If the NRC is faulty, the 55,000 State government employees engaged for the updating exercise are responsible. Why should the common people, who underwent a traumatic phase, pay for their mistakes?” said a spokesperson of the forum.

More than 19 lakh of some 3.3 crore applicants had been left out of the NRC.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/move-to-delist-some-categories-from-updated-nrc-is-contempt-of-sc/article32877627.ece
60,2020/10/17,"In Kolkata, a few Puja committees respond to desperate appeals by doctors","They vow not to allow outsiders to their pandals amid fears of surge in COVID cases

As the fear of surge in COVID-19 cases due to Durga Puja celebrations grips Kolkata harder, at least three crowd-pulling neighbourhoods have announced that outsiders won’t be allowed into their pandals this year.

Since neighbourhoods try to outdo each other in terms of decoration and themes, pandal-hopping is an integral part of the festivities that last five days, involving the movement of hundreds of thousands of people. At the time of the pandemic, pandal-hopping can be highly dangerous for a city like Kolkata, where people are already out shopping for Puja in large numbers.

The indifference on the part of the State government and the public alike is making doctors repeatedly appeal to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to ensure restraint. Under the umbrella of Joint Platform of Doctors, they once again issued a statement on Friday saying that since they had not received any response from either the Chief Minister or the Chief Secretary to their pleas, they were once again urging all political parties and puja committees to advocate restraint.

Online petition

“We even submitted an online petition with 15,000 signatories. But in spite of our appeals, preparations for Puja and shopping are going on in full swing. It is not as if the people concerned are not able to gauge the risk, but they are simply turning a blind eye and on the contrary are doing everything possible to enhance the fervour,” the doctors’ body said.

They pointed out that if there was a surge in the number of infections, hospitals would quickly run out of beds and ventilators and even human resources, and that the authorities should act while there was still time.

‘Radical decision’

Not all are ignoring their appeals. The Puja at Santosh Mitra Square in the heart of Kolkata, which draws massive crowds, has decided to keep their pandal out of bounds for visitors. “Keeping the COVID-19 situation in mind, [we have] taken a radical decision. Only people from our neighbourhood will be allowed entry. This is a difficult decision but we believe that a festival cannot be more valuable than human lives,” its organisers said in a statement.

Two other highly popular Pujas — Jodhpur Park in south Kolkata and Debdaru Phatak in Behala — have also decided to bar the entry of outsiders.

Considering that Assembly elections are barely six months away, the State government, it appears, does not want to make any move that dampens the festive spirit. If anything, it granted — obviously with an eye on the elections — ₹50,000 each to every Puja committee in West Bengal, a decision now questioned by the Calcutta High Court.

“We have cautioned the State government and the political parties. Since they have not paid any heed to our appeal, the blame for the imminent rise in COVID-19 cases will be on them,” said Dr. Punyabrata Goon of the Joint Platform of Doctors. “Ultimately, doctors and other healthcare workers will have to bear the load of patient treatment.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/33qlt6/article32877994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-DURGAPUJA-KOLKATA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/in-kolkata-a-few-puja-committees-respond-to-desperate-appeals-by-doctors/article32877625.ece

63,2020/10/17,"Far from a happy toy story: Traditional toy makers face Chinese goods, high GST and lack of funds","While the Prime Minister says India has the potential to become a hub for the global toy industry, artisans face a range of problems. Appaji Reddem and Laiqh Ahmed Khan report on how an influx of cheaper Chinese toys, high GST, lack of innovation and funds, and inadequate training plague the traditional industry.

Bent over his lathe in one of the by-lanes of Kalanagar in Channapatna, about 60 km from Bengaluru, Meer Kaleem stares at his handiwork, a piece of wood that is taking the shape of a toy’s part, with deep concentration. While his nimble fingers continue their work, his face falls when he starts talking about the seemingly bleak future of the craft that has been the source of livelihood for three generations.

Business is yet to pick up for the famed Channapatna toys after a lockdown imposed across the country to contain the spread of COVID-19 stretched from three weeks to months. Only a few lathes are buzzing in the town. The lockdown worsened the woes of the craftsmen which began with the influx of cheap Chinese toys into the market. Demonetisation in 2016 and imposition of a 12% Goods and Services Tax (GST) on their products dealt additional blows to their business. “And now there is no demand for our products from local retailers. Merchants who used to come from different parts of the country are not showing up. Even exhibitions and fairs across the country, where many of our products are sold, remain closed,” says a worried Kaleem.

Notwithstanding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mention of the brightly coloured Channapatna toys in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme in August and emphasis on the promotion of locally manufactured toys, Kaleem isn’t sure if the industry can return to its heyday anytime soon. The hand-crafted wooden products, which wear coats of vegetable paint and lacquer, enjoyed a good market locally and abroad. He reminisces about the variety of necklaces, bangles, beads and napkin rings he used to carve out from the logs of ivory wood in his lathe, to meet export orders, about 15-20 years ago. “Our products were in great demand in foreign countries even till the late 1990s. But not anymore,” he rues.

The China crisis in Channapatna

The arrival of Chinese toys in the market at almost half the price of the Channapatna toys severely impacted the industry. The assembly line production of Chinese toys makes them far less expensive than the Channapatna toys, which are hand-crafted and hand-painted. Even though Channapatna toys are said to be more durable and safer for children (as they are coloured with vegetable dyes), the Chinese varieties rule the market, artisans say.

Channapatna toys date back to the reign of the 18th century ruler of the erstwhile Mysore kingdom, Tipu Sultan, who invited Persian artisans to train local artisans in making wooden toys. As ivory wood trees, easily distinguishable with their blooms of white, star-shaped flowers, were available aplenty in and around Ramanagara district, the craft flourished in Channapatna. Ivory wood trees help make lightweight toys. The uniqueness of the craft also helped the toys earn the Geographical Indication (GI) tag. The GI tag is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin.

After more than 30 years in the toy-making industry, Kaleem, in his early 50s, does not see his sons taking forward the family legacy. All three of them have taken up other vocations. The number of artisans engaged in the toy-making industry is dwindling as their earnings fall well below the wages offered in other industries, he says.

However, Sunil Kumar, Assistant Director in the Office of Development Commissioner (Handicrafts), Mysuru, claims that the number of Channapatna toy artisans has remained more or less unchanged for many years now, even if it hasn’t increased in proportion to the growing population. About 1,500 of the 2,500 registered Channapatna toy artisans are active now, he says. Of them, about 1,000 are registered with the Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation, which purchases finished products worth a maximum of ₹3,000 from each of the artisans in a month. Two common facility centres set up in Channapatna by the government authorities offer work spaces and lathes at a concessional rate to a few artisans, but a majority of artisans work on their own lathes set up in their homes. Special attention is also paid to the export-oriented toys at one of the two common facility centres, Kumar says.

Also read | Traditional arts take a beating owing to demonetisation

With the Central government’s ‘Atmanirbhar’ policy expected to discourage or even impose a ban on the import of Chinese toys, the officials are hopeful that the fortunes of the Channapatna toy artisans may change. But self-reliance alone isn’t sufficient; the absence of innovation in the design of toys is an area of concern, officials say. Artisans, they say, habitually produce the same set of toys without any innovation. In contrast, the new and attractive designs and colours of the Chinese products score over the Channapatna toys.

Artisans like Krishna, who runs the Manjunatha Toys Store in Channapatna, counter this argument. Krishna displays a diverse set of products in his store, including utility items like car seats made of wooden beads, pencil sharpeners, tissue paper holders, and a variety of tops. Artisans are always willing to innovate as long as there is a market for the products, he argues. Workshops on design innovation, organised by the authorities, are few and far between, while designs introduced by the handicrafts department authorities and the prototypes approved by them rarely translate into a market for the artisans, he says.

Kumar says the government plans to create an online market for the artisans by facilitating their registration on the Government e-Marketplace portal.

Apart from the threat posed by Chinese toys and lack of innovation, there are other ills plaguing the Channapatna toy-making industry. As business is slow, some craftspersons tend to yield to the temptation of making quick money. “The ivory wood needs to be seasoned for at least three to four months before an artisan can start working on it. But a few artisans began making the toys without waiting for the seasoning period to end. The compromise shows in the quality of the product,” says artisan Syed Ameeruddin. A few artisans also use chemical dyes, which are considered harmful for children, instead of vegetable colours, he says. Many countries have strict rules against the import of toys with chemical dyes. As a result, some consignments fail to make the export quality grade.

Also read | It’s his toy story

Modi’s mention of the Channapatna toy industry comes as small consolation to the artisans who have been campaigning for withdrawal of 12% GST on their products as well as for intervention against the alleged hurdles posed by the Forest Department in the transport of ivory wood.

An industry with great potential

More than 700 km away, the toy makers of Etikoppaka and Kondapalli in Andhra Pradesh, and Nirmal in Telangana, see a ray of hope in Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ speech in which he had praised their efforts in keeping a tradition alive despite meagre returns. Lauding the revival efforts of the traditional artisan C.V. Raju of Etikoppaka in Visakhapatnam district, Modi said he wanted start-ups to promote the industry and secure the future of the artisans. He said that while the global toy industry is worth over ₹7 lakh crore, India’s share in it is minimal despite its wide variety of traditional and unique toys.

Also read | Lockdown pushes Etikoppaka toy makers out of play

A back-of-the-envelope calculation by market players on the total annual business of wooden toy handicrafts in Etikoppaka, Kondapalli and Nirmal amounts to about ₹50 crore. This industry has tremendous potential and can provide employment to lakhs of people, according to market estimates.

Etikoppaka is a village on the banks of the Varaha river. Located about 65 km from the port city of Visakhapatnam, the village houses about 10,000 people. Over 200 traditional artisan families are part of the Etikoppaka toy-making industry in the village. The Etikoppaka signature toys include a standing couple, a wedding scene, automobiles, birds, and shehnai troupes. They are made with the soft variety of wood from the Ankudu tree. Like in Channapatna, here too artisans use only vegetable colours. “The soft-edged toys are useful for children. They help their eye-hand coordination, they help them recognise colours and enhance their motor skills. The industry also makes utility, decorative, ornamental and measurement utensils besides toys,” says farmer and artisan Raju, 57.

In Etikoppaka and Kondapalli, the rich tradition of the handicraft needs a larger push, says Raju. He says he wrote to the Department of Science and Technology and the National Innovation Foundation in 2019 seeking help to make his initiative Hasthakala an experiment, interpretation and experience centre of handicrafts. They said they would get back on the proposal, he says.

Industry players and artisans point out that an organised approach towards enhancing the skills of artisans along with subsidies, interest-free loans, scientific development of the industry, market interventions, and official supply of wood and lacquer would ensure the industry’s growth and competitiveness.

Appealing to start-ups

Modi’s mention of Etikoppaka has generated a lot of interest among start-ups and other business communities, says M.P. Dubey, joint director of Software Technology Parks of India (Visakhapatnam). “Etikoppaka handicrafts have a GI tag. That is a valuable resource for start-ups for mutually beneficial tie-ups. We did a lot of research on the sector and we are finding out ways of adding value to the craft so that it can become competitive in the global market. At the same time we have organised a meet to link interested start-ups with the artisans to explore multiple business opportunities for growth,” says Dubey.

Back in the village, the positive vibes from the Prime Minister’s talk reverberate in the form of progressive initiatives by the local artisans to expand business. A couple of groups have chalked out a plan to tap into potential opportunities with IT and other corporate firms. Adarsh, a student of IIM Bangalore, has organised a couple of artisan groups to tap into the corporate social responsibility funding of IT firms for promotion of the crafts industry. “The IT firms, as part of CSR, give a lot of support to upcoming industries and handicrafts. We have made a plan to contact the top 10 IT firms to ask them if Etikoppaka toys can be made a part of their gifting plans. We are also approaching big-ticket wedding organisers asking them to opt for these toys as return gifts. We have positive signals from the market,” says Adarsh.

But funding poses a big problem to bulk manufacturing, says Ramanababu, president of the Etikoppaka Mutually-Aided Cooperative Society. The society urgently needs a ₹5 crore corpus fund to buy the toys in bulk from artisans and fulfil major orders, he says. “Most of the time we lose business not because of lack of expertise but the inability to fulfil expectations. Artisans are not in a position to make toys in bulk and store them with the society because of financial issues. A corpus fund can solve this problem. And there should also be a mechanism to arrest the volume of Chinese toys in our market. Chinese toys sell more than local toys even in places like Etikoppaka. The government should help us to be atma nirbhar this way. Many youngsters are ready to learn and pursue the handicraft,” he says.

The society is also concerned about the sharp fluctuations in the cost of lacquer. Lacquer costs anything between ₹300 and ₹1,100 per kg. The proposed fund is also expected to be used for bulk purchase of lacquer and supply it to artisans at a wholesale price.

On an average, an artisan gets ₹30,000 a month if he works five days a week. The income can be enhanced four times if the industry is promoted in the right way, say artisan associations.

Illegal wood in Kondapalli

The elegant toys of Kondapalli include wooden-painted bullock carts, a Dasavataram set, a palanquin, wedding sets, farmers in the field, and Sita, Rama and Lakshmana in a boat. The 45-year-old third generation artisan, Samala Satyanarayana, from Kondapalli village near Vijayawada, says the primary issue with the industry is its basic ingredient, the Tella Poniki wood, which is illegal to fell. “I’ve been making Kondapalli toys for 25 years. But I am forced to use illegal wood procured by woodcutters as respective governments have failed to regularise it despite our long-pending demand. The Forest Department can also get good revenue if the government agrees to our demand,” he says.

Here, too, artisans complain about GST. And now COVID-19 has led to a steep fall in business. The orders from the government-owned Lepakshi have also come down, they say. Regular bulk orders come from private purchasers in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Artisans say that they are given short-term training by the skill development corporation. Training for 15 days to three months is not sufficient, they say. At least a year of training is required for professional expertise in the craft. “We need authorised wood. It needs to be supplied by the government after treatment so that it is immune to pests. The treatment plant is too expensive for us to establish,” says one artisan.

The artisans, who are using their own innovative methods and advanced tools to make toys, say that the government can help them create innovative tools to enable faster manufacturing. “It’s a long process but it will work if the government takes interest. Making toys faster is also important in the age of technology. Sometimes, we get bulk orders from corporates but usually they give very little time for manufacturing,” says Satyanarayana.

Online marketing avenues too are not working well for the artisans, he says. Higher prices on Amazon and Flipkart means fewer customers. “We also need subsidised loans. Interest-free loans would work well for us. Right now we have a loan with a 9.5% interest rate. Now there is a huge dip in demand due to the pandamic. There are fewer orders, there is pressure from private lenders, maintenance costs, etc., and there is no support from any direction as usual,” laments one artisan.

Meanwhile, efforts by artisans and local leaders to build a facility to promote the industry have borne fruit. The work related to a new artisan facility in the place of an old one in the middle of Kondapalli has advanced. The proposed building for wood processing is under way, according to Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani). “We facilitated a ₹1.8 crore MSME fund, and a matching grant of ₹50 lakh was allocated from my MPLAD funds. The facility will be built soon,” Srinivas told The Hindu.

Demand for eco-friendly toys

To encourage the next generation to take the legacy of toy-making forward, the government should provide funds and old-age pensions, says B.R. Shankar, manager of the Nirmal Toys and Arts Industrial Cooperative Society. The number of families who make the finely carved Nirmal toys in the towns of Nirmal in Adilabad district of Telangana has come down to 50 from over 100 a few years ago, says Shankar. “Apart from providing loans and longer training periods, the government should help us find ways to restart exports. There were no revival efforts after these handicrafts were banned by some countries few years ago,” Shankar says.

Market research reports suggest that there is greater demand for eco-friendly wooden toys across the world. There is a visible change in the way schools and households are looking at toys for children, say artisans. Toys made of plastic and other hazardous material are being replaced by wooden toys and toys made of other non-hazardous material. This provides wooden toy-makers a great opportunity to innovate and meet the surging demand. Artisans feel encouraged by Modi’s push, but the toy story can end well only if their many problems are addressed and the government manages to bring the industry out of the woods, they say.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k9gbhe/article32876126.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THGZLEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/far-from-a-happy-toy-story-traditional-toy-makers-face-chinese-goods-high-gst-and-lack-of-funds/article32876129.ece

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah seeking an immediate flood relief assistance of ₹2,250 crore, or at least ₹1,000 crore.

He said the State suffered heavy loss due to rains and floods triggered by the deep depression in the Bay of Bengal, and it required adequate financial support from the Centre.

The Central government should send a team to do a detailed assessment of the loss incurred, which was initially pegged at ₹4,450 crore, he requested the Union Minister.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy informed Mr. Shah that many parts of the State were battered by rains from October 9 to 13.

I. Polavaram mandal in East Godavari district recorded the highest rainfall of 26 cm on October 13, he said. Several mandals in East and West Godavari districts received more than 20 cm rainfall in a single day, he added.

The Krishna was in spate due to the massive inflows it received from its upper reaches in Maharashtra and Telangana.

A large number of people were evacuated to safety as the rivers were swollen. The road network was badly damaged, canals had breaches and power supply has gone haywire at many places, the Chief Minister said.

Bird watchers will not be disappointed this year as the Pulicat lagoon and its surroundings in Nellore district brim with water to beckon the winged visitors in a big way.

With the major reservoirs, which include Somasila and Kandaleru, getting bountiful inflows due to the floods in several spells in the Krishna, the arrival of the migratory birds, which include the flamingos, to the picturesque lagoon has begun.

75,2020/10/17,"A.P. should show the way in NEP implementation, says Governor","He asks Vice-Chancellors to take the lead role in overcoming challenges, if any

Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan on Friday said the State should be a role model in the country in the implementation of the National Education Policy-2020.

Addressing the Vice-Chancellors of 20 universities at a review meeting organised remotely from Raj Bhavan, the Governor said the State government was committed to implementing the NEP in its true spirit, and urged the Vice-Chancellors to take a leading role in its implementation by overcoming the challenges, if any.

National programmes

Pointing to the fact that the policy envisions a robust and vibrant public education system in the country, he said that the national flagship programmes such as ‘Unnat Bharat Abhiyan’ and ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ would also be part of the NEP-2020 and said that the issues of financial, infrastructure, human resource and governance in the universities were pro-actively being addressed by the government.

Education Minister A. Suresh said that the NEP was expected to bring about structural, institutional and curricular reforms in the higher education system in the country and many of the suggestions made by the government had been incorporated in the policy in respect of governance and financial aspects such as improving the GER (Gross Enrolment Ratio) through incentivising education through programmes such as Jagananna Amma Vodi and Jagananna Goru Mudda.

The Minister said the government had already implemented several recommendations of the NEP- 2020 such as academic quality audit cell, skill development centre, incubation centres etc. even before the launch of the policy.

He pointed out that the State’s GER stood at 32.4% against the national average of 28.8%, and the NEP-2020 envisaged to achieve a GER of 50% by 2035, whereas the State government aimed at achieving a GER of 90% by 2035. Infrastructure in higher education institutions would be upgraded under the Nadu-Nedu programme.

The Minister said the NEP would transform the education sector in the country as it focused on making education accessible, equitable, inclusive.

Mobile application

Secretary to Governor Mukesh Kumar Meena said Raj Bhavan had taken the initiative to develop a mobile application in which the universities could upload data on monthly progress made by them in the implementation of NEP, for review of the Governor.

Special Chief Secretary, Higher Education, Satish Chandra, and Chairman, AP State Council of Higher Education, Hemachandra Reddy, also participated.

76,2020/10/17,Tribals happy with distribution of RoFR pattas: Deputy CM,"Srivani defends decision to shift Tribal University to Saluru Agency

Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Tribal Welfare P. Pushpa Srivani on Friday said that distribution of Records of Forest Rights (RoFR) pattas to the landless tribal people would bring about a remarkable change in their economic status.

“The exercise kick-started on October 2 to distribute 3 lakh acres to 1.53 lakh tribal families will be completed by November 2,” Ms. Srivani told the media here.

Tribal families involved in agriculture activity used to face many hardships in the absence of right over the land, she said. “Each tribal family will get at least two acres under the programme. For the first time, even revenue land is being given. The initiative will ensure a decent income to the beneficiaries,” said Ms. Srivani.

Dig at TDP

“The tribal people had faced many problems during the TDP term. That was why, they had rejected the TDP in the 2019 elections. The opposition party will face a severe drubbing in the 2024 elections too as almost all the tribal families are happy with the distribution of the pattas by the YSRCP,” she said.

Defending the decision to shift the Central Tribal University from S. Kota constituency to Saluru constituency, she said, “India’s first National Tribal University was established in the tribal area of Amarkantak in Anuppur district of Madhya Pradesh. Taking a cue from it, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has decided to locate the university in the Saluru Agency area since S. Kota is an urban locality,” she added.

“We have communicated the same to the Central team that visited Kottakki village in Saluru constituency. It has good road connectivity. The proposed international airport at Bhogapuram is also located nearby,” said Ms. Srivani.

Promising to improve road connectivity in all the tribal areas in the State in a phased manner, she said, “The Ministry of Tribal Welfare has done a detailed study on the budget required to lay roads in the remote areas. There will be no connectivity issues in the future as the government is keen on allocating more funds under the ST Sub-Plan,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tribals-happy-with-distribution-of-rofr-pattas-deputy-cm/article32877009.ece

Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao has requested the Central government to sanction funds for the development of several projects in the State.

He was addressing the media here on Friday after taking part in the video-conference with Union Minister of Tourism and Culture Prahalad Singh Patel.

Mr. Srinivasa Rao said the State government had already proposed 10 projects costing ₹951 crore under the Swadesh Darshan, PRASAD and other schemes.

“Out of the 10 projects, six have been prioritised and four are under consideration. The project to develop the Simhachalam temple under PRASAD has already been approved,” the Minister said.

Similarly, sanction of funds was also sought for the development of the Araku Eco-Tourism Circuit under the Swadesh Darshan scheme at an estimated cost of ₹128 crore, the Minister said.

“I have requested the Union Minister to launch the works pertaining to the Simhachalam temple that have already been approved,” he said.

The proposals that were under consideration included the development of Rajamahendravaram Heritage, Eco & Nature Tourism Circuit, Kolleru Lake, Tirupati temple town and Kanaka Durga temple in Vijayawada.

While responding positively to the State’s proposals, Mr. Prahalad Singh Patel also expressed satisfaction over the progress of other works in the State, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said.

With the Central assistance under the Swadesh Darshan scheme, the State had completed the development of Kakinada Hope Island-Konaseema Coastal Tourism Circuit, and works on the coastal tourism circuit in Nellore district were nearing completion, he said. Development of the Srisailam temple under the PRASAD scheme was also nearing completion, he added.

He reviewed the situation with special officers of Revenue, Police, Health and Disaster Management departments appointed for the Krishna floods and asked them to shift people to the rehabilitation centres using tractors and boats. Take the police help in case someone refused to move to the shelters, he said.

Later, the Collector told reporters that the discharge from Prakasam Barrage would cross 9 to 10 lakh cusecs as there were heavy discharges from the Srisailam, Pulichintala, Munneru and Musi projects due to heavy rain.

“There are 18 lanka villages in Kolluru mandal from where people are being moved to the rehabilitation centre at Donepudi. We are using 30 boats of the Fisheries Department for shifting people and restricting the number to 10-15 persons per boat. Rehabilitation centres have also been arranged in Kolluru, Bhattiprole and Kollipara,” said the Collector.

79,2020/10/17,Operation to tow out aground ship begins,"It involves two phases and may go on for a month

The operation to tow out the 3000-tonne Bangladeshi ship MV Maa that ran aground near Tenneti Park in Visakhapatnam on October 13, began on brisk footing here on Friday.

The Protection and Indemnity Club which is responsible for overseeing the operation on behalf of the owners of the ship, have appointed Visakhapatnam-based Gill Marines, a company that specialises in such operations, to remove the oil (fuel) that is stored onboard the ship.

Meanwhile, as per the Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) officials, the owners of the ship have appointed Mumbai-based Resolve Marines to take up the salvage operation and re-float the vessel. Deputy Conservator of VPT Cpt Mohanti said that the entire operation had two phases – first the oil had to be removed and the second stage involved salvage, re-float and pulling the ship back to safer waters. “To begin with, oil is being removed and we have also placed our team to check that there is no oil spill,” he said.

On Friday, earth movers were seen clearing the sand from the road front to the aground ship, to enable free movement of men and material.

Challenging task

The owner of Gill Marines, Surender Gill, told The Hindu that though the ship was small in size and weighed just around 3000 tonnes, it was going to be a complex and challenging task and might take about a month.

Right now the operation is focussed on removing about 40 tonnes of fuel that is stored onboard the ship. This will make the ship lighter and it is necessary as per protocol to avoid any oil spill, and to contain any damage to the ecology and environment.

How it is done

Speaking about probable salvage procedures, Mr. Gill said once the oil was transferred from the ship, efforts would be made to create tunnels under the ship by using specialised equipment such as high-power water jets, so that balloons could be laid under the belly of the ship.

The flat balloons would be inflated to lift the ship and free it from the sand and rocks, on which it was sitting now, he said.

What makes the operation complex is that the key factor is high tide. Everything has to synchronise – the inflation of the balloons has to coincide with the high tide timings and only then tugs can be deployed to tow it out.

The rocky terrain of the Tenneti Beach is another challenge, as a small mistake can rupture the belly of the ship, and it could then be disastrous.

If required, the ballast tank would be emptied, to make the ship lighter, Mr. Gill said.

The work is under way in coordination with the authorities from the VPT, Indian Coast Guard, District Administration, Marine Police, P&I Club and DG Shipping.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/t2j7bd/article32876895.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VJSHIPSALVAGAE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/operation-to-tow-out-aground-ship-begins/article32876896.ece
80,2020/10/17,"Think out of the box, teachers told","Five-day workshop of academic calendar design gets under way

B. Rajasekhar, Principal Secretary, School Education, on Friday asked teachers to practise unconventional or alternative teaching methods to not only enhance learning for the children in the classroom but further integrate the concepts of the lessons being taught, easily and in a simple way for better understanding.

Addressing the inaugural session of a five-day workshop on designing an alternative academic calendar by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) from October 16 to 20, Mr. Rajasekhar said teachers should adopt an innovative approach by thinking out of box, even a disaster like the COVID-19 pandemic could also be turned into an opportunity.

Sharing the guidelines on designing the alternative calendar with subject teachers across the State who attended the session, he urged them to focus on personalised adopting learning to kindle the creative side of the students.

He said as was discussed earlier, students would be divided in ‘High-tech’, ‘Low tech’ and ‘No tech’ categories and the teaching strategies would have to be designed accordingly.

‘No bag day’

Samagra Shiksha State Project Director K.Vetri Selvi said in the first two weeks of the reopening of schools, teachers should make the students aware of the precautions to be followed in view of the prevailing pandemic. Teachers would be trained in the task through a webinar, she said, adding that the calendar should include ‘No bag day’ on Saturdays.

SCERT Director B. Pratap Reddy, explained the mode of designing the calendar through a power-point presentation.

School Education Director Vadrevu Chinaveerabhadrudu said from November 2 to April 30, 51 topics would be taught in an innovative way. He said the calendar was being designed in strict adherence to the unlock 5.0 guidelines.

81,2020/10/17,"After a lull, red sanders operatives back in action","During combing operation, task force personnel notice traces of smugglers’ movement

After a lull of about six months, influx of the red sanders smuggling operatives from the north-western districts of Tamil Nadu into the Seshachalam hills spread over Chittoor and Kadapa districts has resumed. The area with cascading streams and rivulets coupled with dense undergrowth provides the trespassers the much-needed support to hoodwink the combing task force teams and to camp for a fortnight and beyond on the banks of scenic streams.

The smuggling activity in the Seshachalam hills came to a halt on March 24 when lockdown was clamped in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19. Three months later, the bustle of woodcutters resumed, but on a negligible scale following curbs at the border check-posts. With complete lifting of the restrictions on the transport across the borders, the movement of woodcutters has slowly returned to its visible levels since a week.

According to the officials of the Red Sanders Task Force, the number of operatives present in the Talakona range alone since a couple of days is over 40, apart from other batches on their errands at Chamla and Balapalle ranges. During the fresh combing operations, the task force personnel have come across several halting points of the operatives, where the latter found enough time to cook meal and enjoy booze as well. In the previous years, the operatives had to go several kms in search of water, but now they could find it in just a few meters from wherever they halt.

The copious rains in the biosphere from June till now led to cascading waterfalls and streams between Talakona to Rajampeta range.

Now that the operatives are exploiting the benefits of rains and undergrowth, the task force personnel observe that the scenario has made their task very tough. As most rivulets and streams are brimming with rainwater, the chances of detecting the footprints of the smuggling operatives turn bleak.

It is observed that during hot summer months, the forest paths would be clear and the sounds of axing the trees and clatter of cooking utensils and murmurs of the operatives could be detected with some degree of accuracy.

Green cover

A combing expert and Inspector of the Red Sanders Task Force, M. Vasu, speaking to The Hindu confirmed that the rains and density of green cover in recent months turned a boon for the smuggling operatives. He said that fresh batches are now hitting their old trails through Bhimavaram and Chamla valleys, Kalyani dam and Talakona range, trekking over 40 km towards red sanders rich beats on the borders with Kadapa.

“After a lull in combing activity, we too find our paths completely covered with undergrowth, making our advancement difficult. The sighting of wild animals, mostly bears, wild elephants and reptiles, is another cause for concern,” said the task force official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/60pngh/article32876834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12ONGRED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/after-a-lull-red-sanders-operatives-back-in-action/article32876835.ece

84,2020/10/17,Bhima gets more ferocious as discharge from Sonna Barrage jumps to 8 lakh cusecs,"Thousands of houses destroyed in villagesin Kalaburagi; Army, IAF rescue teams join NDRF

With the discharge of water from Sonna Barrage in Afzalpur taluk of Kalaburagi district touching 8 lakh cusecs on Saturday, river Bhima got more ferocious, flooding vast tracts of farmlands and villages along its course in Afzalpur, Chittapur, Jewargi, Kalaburagi and Shahabad taluks.

As Deputy Chief Minister and Kalaburagi in-charge Govind Karjol put it, for the first time in the history, as much as 8 lakh cusecs of water is flowing in the Bhima.

“Even in 2009 floods, the amount of water flowing in Bhima had not crossed 2.60 lakh cusecs. Now, 8 lakh cusecs is flowing, destroying thousands of houses that were built using mud and stone in the villages along the river course downstream. Sonna Barrage that had never been submerged in its history is now under water,” he said in a video message on Friday.

The ferocity of current in Bhima is so high that the floodwater is flowing back in Kagina river, the tributary of Bhima, near Honagunta village in Shahabad taluk where the latter joins the former.

Deputy Commissioner of Kalaburagi, Vijaya Jyothsna, has cautioned people that the discharge of water from Sonna Barrage is expected to rise. She is releasing video-messages appealing to the people along the banks of Bhima and Kagina downstream to immediately move to safer places and cooperate with the administration in rescue operations.

Rescue teams of Indian Army and Air Force have joined the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams that were already on the job. No loss of human life has been reported in the past 48 hours.

Owing to the heavy rainfall in the region coupled with the heavy discharge of water from Maharashtra reservoirs, all the rivers, tributaries and streams in the district had been overflowing for the last one week flooding the hundreds of villages and destroying farmlands. Though the rains in the region have subsided for the last three days to bring down the water level in Kagina and other streams, the water level in Bhima is constantly rising due to the heavy rainfall in its catchment area in Maharashtra and resultant discharge of heavy water from Ujjani and Veer reservoirs in the neighbouring State.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ccg2qh/article32880400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17kalaburagi-floods,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bhima-gets-more-ferocious-as-discharge-from-sonna-barrage-jumps-to-8-lakh-cusecs/article32880381.ece
85,2020/10/17,Notification closing tourist places during Dasara holidays withdrawn,"Chief Minister relents to appeal by stakeholders including hoteliers and tour operators

The notification on closure of tourist places in Mysuru from October 17 to November 1 issued by the district administration to curb the surge in COVID-19 cases, has been withdrawn following protests by stakeholders.

The district in-charge Minister, S.T. Somashekar, made the announcement during the inauguration of Dasara on Saturday that consequent to the appeal by the stakeholders and to ensure that tourism does not suffer another crippling blow, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has directed the district administration to withdrawn the notification. Mr. Somashekar said it will be mandatory for the tourists to ensure social distancing and personal hygiene besides wearing masks.

Mysuru Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri had issued a directive last week that the closure would come into effect from October 17 coinciding with the beginning of Dasara. This was to discourage tourists from surrounding districts to make a beeline to Mysuru during the festival holidays and to participate in Dasara which, the authorities fear, will result in a surge in the COVID-19 cases.

Some of the tourist spots including the palace, zoo, Chamundi Hills, and KRS in the neighbouring district of Mandya, used to register a high footfall during the pre-pandemic times and hence there were concerns about the fallout of huge congregation amidst the ongoing war against the pandemic.

The decision was also taken based on the Kerala experience when the number of COVID-19 cases registered a sharp surge after the Onam holidays. As Mysuru draws a huge crowd during Dasara, the district administration which is under pressure to reduce the case load and take appropriate measures, thought it fit to discourage tourists from visiting the city during the festival holiday season. Though Kodagu and Mandya disricts too followed suit, the closure was limited to a few specific days and not the entire duration of the holiday season.

But stakeholders represented by Mysuru Travels Association, Hotel Owners Association, registered guides etc., opposed the move on the grounds that the closure of tourist places amounted to imposing new restrictions at a time when the State government itself was in favour of opening up public places.

The association members pointed out that the State Tourism Department was promoting Karnataka stating it was safe to travel and they were ready to welcome the tourists. But the directives closing tourist places was antithetical to the government’s move on graded unlocking to revive the economy.

They submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister who was in Mysuru for Dasara inauguration and pleaded their case following which he sought a review of the original decision.

However, this volte face by the government on a measure to curb the spread of the pandemic, has also come under criticism from various quarters on the grounds that it went against the stated objective of tackling the pandemic. A section of the officials, on condition of anonymity, underlined the contradiction in the government’s stated objectives and deeds. They said on the one hand the elected representatives are appealing to people to watch the proceedings live on TV and not venture outside. On the other hand they are opening up tourist places, illuminating Mysuru etc which encourages congregation and tourist movement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/notification-closing-tourist-places-during-dasara-holidays-withdrawn/article32880304.ece

Dr. Manjunath, who is in the forefront of the COVID-19 combat, inaugurated the festivities at 7.45 a.m. by lighting a lamp. All dignitaries showered flower petals on the ‘utsava murthy’ of Goddess Chamundeshwari placed in a specially decorated silver chariot, marking the beginning of the simple yet traditional annual celebrations.

On the occasion, Mr. Yediyurappa felicitated Dr. Manjunath, who has been constantly guiding the State government on dealing with the pandemic. Six COVID-19 warriors – health officer Naveen T.R., staff nurse Rukmini, police constable Kumar P., pourakarmika Maragamma, ASHA worker Noor Jahan and social worker Ayub Ahmed – were honoured in recognition of their unstinting fight against the pandemic.

He said the government was fighting the pandemic untiringly and the panic among the people over the disease must go in successfully combating the crisis.

Dr. Manjunath said he considers the honour given to him by the government for inaugurating the Mysuru Dasara as the biggest honour in his life.

In his address, the Chief Minister said he has prayed to the Goddess to free the State from the pandemic which has put the people and the State in distress.

He said the festivities are being celebrated taking all precautions and urged the people to comply with the SOPs issued by the government for a safe festive season.

He said Dr. Manjunath was chosen for inaugurating Dasara to express gratitude to the medical community for its determined fight against COVID-19. “Let us all fight the pandemic together and stop its spread.”

On the flood situation in Kalaburagi and other places in North Karnataka, he said the government was with the flood-affected people and said the Deputy Commissioner of Kalaburagi has been asked to shift the victims to safer places and look after their well-being.

88,2020/10/17,‘Theerthodbhava’ takes place at Talacauvery,"Sacred water gushed from tiny pond watched by a small group, following curbs on public gathering over COVID-19 scare

A small number of people witnessed the Cauvery Theerthodbhava at Talacauvery in Kodagu district on Saturday amidst strict enforcement of safety precautions over COVID-19 scare.

The usual bustle and congregation of thousands of devotees on the foothills of Brahmagiri for witnessing the divine occurrence was missing this year with restrictions imposed on public entry to the site for controlling the pandemic spread. However, all traditions and rituals were carried out by the priests at Talacauvery since the early hours of Saturday, complying with the mandated SOPs.

The sacred water or ‘thirtha’ gushed from the ‘Brahma Kundike’ (a tiny pond) at the Talacauvery temple at 7:04 a.m., much to the delight of those eagerly waiting for the event. The water, said to be the source of the Cauvery, was sprinkled on the gathering by the priests.

As per the Hindu almanac, the time specified for the emergence of thirtha was 7.03 a.m. This time, it emerged from the pond a minute late.

Minister in-charge of Kodagu V. Somanna, MLA Appachu Ranjan, other elected representatives, Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy and others witnessed the occurrence.

Mr. Somanna, after the event, said curbs had caused disappointment to the people as they used to participate in large numbers with great enthusiasm to witness the occasion besides taking a dip in the pond and collecting the holy water. But in view of the pandemic, curbs had become necessary.

He said the rituals associated with the event had been carried out and thanked the people for cooperating with the administration over its measures. “I have prayed to the Goddess Cauvery to end COVID-19 sufferings,” he told reporters.

This year, no special buses are running to Talacauvery from Madikeri and other places, and the movement of private vehicles too had been restricted to avoid crowding during the event.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bbnj6q/article32879521.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17kodagu-mys-theerthodbhava,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/theerthodbhava-takes-place-at-talacauvery/article32879476.ece
89,2020/10/17,Private Dasara of the Wadiyars to be a muted affair this year,"The private Dasara of the Wadiyars to be held from Saturday within the Amba Vilas Palace will be a restricted affair and not open even to immediate family members in view of the pandemic.

The elaborate affair used to start with rites and rituals supervised by priests. It was followed by a private durbar of the Wadiyars, which drew a good number of people, to witness the symbolic ascension of the golden throne. No invitation has been sent out this year.

Palace secretary Lakshminarayan said there will be no one to witness the Khas Durbar this year, though Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar will perform all the religious rites associated with Navaratri. The rites and rituals used to include a battery of priests to chant the hymns, dharmadhikaris to supervise the proceedings apart from their assistants, but the numbers have been curtailed this year, he said.

The Vajra Mushti Kalaga, a form of wrestling that has gone out of vogue but used to be held on Vijayadashmi, has also been cancelled. The procession of the Wadiyars that used to take place before the Jumboo Savari, will be nothing more than a drive to the temple.

Narasimhan, curator of the Jayachamarajendra Art Gallery, said this is the first time in the last few decades that such restrictions have been introduced, though there have been disruptions. But, various rituals associated with Navaratri will be observed, he added.

The tradition has been passed on by the Vijayanagar rulers and after their decline, it was inherited by the Wadiyars. Raja Wadiyar, who ascended the throne at Srirangapatana in 1610 CE, proclaimed that Navaratri would be be celebrated on a grand scale and provided it royal patronage.

Mr. Lakshminarayan said the practice continued till modern times and Jayachamaraja Wadiyar conducted the last public Dasara in 1969. Then came the disruption when the Government of India abolished the privy purses and privileges to the former rulers in 1970, it was passed in Parliament in 1971 after which the last maharaja restricted Dasara to the palace.

Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar resumed the Khas Durbar and other paraphernalia associated with Navaratri a few years later, while there was a people’s movement in the city that led to intervention by the State government, which decided to revive Dasara in 1975, according to Mr. Lakshminarayan.

In recent times, Dasara emerged as a fulcrum to promote tourism. This year, the pandemic has put paid to all plans and the celebrations funded by the government and the tradition observed by the erstwhile royals will be a muted affair.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/4k6shm/article32877680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGKHASDARBARMYS4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/private-dasara-of-the-wadiyars-to-be-a-muted-affair-this-year/article32877681.ece

91,2020/10/17,Stakeholders fret over closure of tourist spots,"All such places in Mysuru will stay closed from October 17 to November 1

Stakeholders in the tourism sector who are against the closure of places of tourist interest during Dasara holidays, have reiterated their demand to lift the restrictions on the grounds to help revive the sector.

In a memorandum addressed to the Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, they also pointed out the what they termed as contradiction in the administration’s decision. “On the one hand, the Department of Tourism is promoting Karnataka as safe for tourists while the district administration has ordered the closure of tourist places,” the stakeholders said.

Appeal to CM

The stakeholders also met the CM, who is in Mysuru, and appealed to him to get the district administration’s order rescinded.

Ms. Sindhuri ordered the closure of all important tourist spots in Mysuru during Dasara holidays from October 17 to November 1 as a measure to curb the surge in COVID-19 cases being reported acrossthe district. Similar restrictions have been introduced in the neighbouring districts of Kodagu and Mandya.

The stakeholders, represented by Mysuru Travels’ Association, Hotel Owners’ Association, Mysore District Tourist Vehicle Drivers and Owners’ Welfare Association, Mysuru Approved Tourist Guides’ Association, and other groups said the closure will affect thousands of people who are directly and indirectly dependent on tourism.

Cost of event

They also questioned the need for spending money on illuminating the city if the tourists were to be restricted. A section of the stakeholders told mediapersons that tourists are being asked to stay away but the government was spending crores on the event though it was devoid of popular programmes like Yuva Dasara, Ahara Mela, etc. “The amount could have been utilised to ramp up city infrastructure and also to bail out the stakeholders in the tourism sector,” they added.

Prashanth, president, Mysuru Travels’ Association, said the State has lifted the restriction on the assembly of more than 100 persons under Lockdown 5.

But in Mysuru restrictions are being imposed and this comes at a time when the State has permitted even multiplexes and theatres to reopen, he said, urging the district administration to reconsider its decision on closing tourist spots.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/stakeholders-fret-over-closure-of-tourist-spots/article32877673.ece

93,2020/10/17,"Case fatality, positivity rates fall in Mysuru","Weekly death rate drops to 1.8% and weekly positivity rate slips to 9%

The weekly COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR), which was between 2.2% and 2.5% last month has dropped to 1.8% this month. Also, the weekly positivity rate, which was between 14.2% and 20.7% from September till early this month, has dropped to 9%.

According to the COVID-19 war room in Bengaluru, the positivity rate was 10.2% in seven days and the weekly CFR was 1.8%. In seven days, Mysuru reported 62 deaths. As on Thursday, Mysuru had 6,980 active cases.

The biggest worry for the government and the authorities ahead of the Dasara festivities was the increasing fatalities in Mysuru, which was second highest in the State after Bengaluru. The slight drop in CFR may bring some relief to the district administration, which has the challenging task of keeping Mysuru safe from COVID-19 spread during the festive season.

Between September 9 and 15, the CFR was 2.2% and 2.5% between September 16 and 22. It dropped to as low as 0.6% between September 23 and 29 (this was perhaps because the deaths were not updated daily following the strike by the contract health workers). Between September 30 and October 6, the CFR was 2.3%, which dropped to 1.8% from October 7 to 13, according to the figures furnished by the war room.

As the disease burden went up last month, the number of persons who tested positive per 100 samples was 20.7 (between September 9 and 15). It dropped to 20.1% between September 16 and 22. The positivity rate dropped further to 14% between September 23 and 29, but went up marginally to 14.2% between September 30 and October 6. Till October 13, the weekly positivity rate stood at 9%, bringing marginal respite to those combating the infection.

As announced by the district administration that tests had been ramped up to contain the pandemic, the average antigen tests per day and average RT-PCR tests per day have significantly gone up. As many as 2,241 PCR tests are being done per day based on the figures available between October 7 and 13. Likewise, 2,855 antigen tests were conducted in the same period.

Between October 7 and 13, nearly 20,000 RATs had been done (an increase by nearly 10,000 tests a week), while 15,688 PCR tests were conducted in the same week. Nearly 200% test target had been achieved between October 7 and 13, which is a 100% jump in the target compared to the previous week. The number of samples collected per day has also increased, with nearly 4,380 samples collected between October 7 and 13, while it was 4,067 between September 30 and October 6. When compared to the previous month, more than 1,000 samples per day were being collected for testing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/f3tp3v/article32877644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGCOVID19MYS4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/case-fatality-positivity-rates-fall-in-mysuru/article32877645.ece
94,2020/10/17,Performance review reveals contrary data,"The COVID-19 Performance Review of Mysuru district released by the Karnataka State COVID-19 war room shows that Mysuru reported 24,822 cases in a span of seven days.

This meant that the average cases per day in seven days should have been around 3,500 cases a day. On the contrary, the cases reported in Mysuru, as per the daily health bulletin, were less than 1,000 cases per day barring one or two days, when cases were little over the 1,000 mark.

When this was the case, there was a doubt on how Mysuru could report 24,822 cases in seven days. There could be an ‘incongruity’ in the data entry since such a big number was unthinkable if the daily bulletins were considered. The figure given in the review would need to be clarified as the same report shows a drop in the weekly positivity rate.

Meanwhile, the number of contacts per person in seven days was 12, while percentage of patients with no contact in seven days was 19.4%.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/performance-review-reveals-contrary-data/article32877629.ece
95,2020/10/17,‘Return excess amount collected by private hospitals to patients’,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Friday asked government officials to recover from private hospitals the amount they had collected in excess of the charges fixed by the government for COVID-19 treatment and return the same to the patients.

At a meeting of senior officials convened here to discuss the measures needed to control the surge of COVID-19 in Mysuru district, Mr. Yediyurappa said action had been taken against private hospitals in Bengaluru that were charging the patients in excess of the amount stipulated by the government. Even in Mysuru, officials should recover the excess amount collected by the private hospitals and return the same to the patients, he said.

Private hospitals in Mysuru had been accused of failing to set aside 50% of their beds for COVID-19 treatment. However, the hospitals had now fallen in line and were setting aside 400 beds for treatment of COVID-19 patients, said Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri while briefing the CM.

In view of the delay the district administration was facing for recruitment of nurses and D-group employees through tender process, Mr. Yediyurappa asked the officials to consider appointment through direct interviews so that the necessary para medical staff can be arranged to fight COVID-19 as early as possible.

Minister for Co-operation S.T. Somashekar, who is also the Minister in charge of Mysuru district, said necessary steps had been taken by the authorities to ramp up testing infrastructure in the district.

Also, he said Dasara celebrations had been scaled down substantially this year in view of COVID-19. While illumination of roads and buildings had been reduced to half of its normal scale, all necessary steps had been taken as per the recommendations of the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee to minimise congregation of people during Dasara.

The meeting was also attended by Additional Chief Secretary Javed Akthar, Commissioner of Health and Family Welfare Services Pankaj Kumar Pandey, Mysuru City Police Commissioner Chandragupta, Superintendent of Mysuru district police C.B.

97,2020/10/17,AAP members stage unique protest in Hubballi,"They clean underpass to highlight poor work under the Hubballi Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System

Taking exception to, what they termed, poor quality and unscientific execution of work under the Hubballi Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (HD-BRTS), members of the Aam Aadmi Party staged a unique protest by cleaning up an underpass across the dedicated bus corridor in Hubballi on Friday.

Already there have been complaints of unscientific execution of works under BRTS, which has led to frequent waterlogging of the roads.

The lastest is that of the underpass near Sana College at Bhairidevarakoppa in Hubballi, which too gets flooded during the rain.

The AAP members cleaned up the underpass and the surrounding area to highlight the problem.

‘Badly maintained’

Leading the protest, president of the Dharwad district unit of AAP Santosh Naragund said that although it was the lone underpass in the entire BRTS project, it had been built unscientifically and badly maintained. The underpass was the only option for the commuters and pedestrians to cross the road. However the authorities had badly maintained it posing health risks to the citizens, he said.

“Probably the sorry state of the underpass has not come to the notice of leaders who keep on speaking about Swachh Bharat. The underpass which should have been people-friendly has become anti-people. There is no information board, no light, and no CCTV cameras in the underpass. There is no safety at all for women and the public,” he said, taking a dig at BJP leaders.

Mr. Santosh pointed out that on getting to know about the AAP protest, the authorities had pumped out the rainwater from the underpass, which was a partial win for the protesters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/92co0/article32877411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGAAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/aap-members-stage-unique-protest-in-hubballi/article32877412.ece
98,2020/10/17,Bhima river continues to be in spate,"This is owing to water discharge from Maharashtra

Though the water level in the Kagina came down after the rains subsided for the second consecutive day on Friday, the Bhima continues to be in spate owing to the heavy discharge of water from Maharashtra reservoirs.

Since the water discharge from Ujjani and Veer reservoirs in Maharashtra increased to around 7 lakh cusecs on Thursday night owing to the heavy rainfall in the Bhima catchment areas upstream, the inflow at Sonna barrage across the Bhima at Afzalpur taluk in Kalaburagi district rose to 5.85 lakh cusecs on Friday morning and then to 6.3 lakh cusecs by 5 p.m.

The same amount of water was released to the river, and tracts of farm fields with standing crops along its course in Afzalpur, Chittapur, Jewargi, Kalaburagi, and Shahbad taluks.

Residents along the banks anxiously watched the overflowing Bhima and prepared to move to safer places. In many places, the floodwater had already entered the villages. The entire Muttuga village and over 500 houses at Honagunta village in Shahabad taluk were flooded on Thursday night and residents struggled to get drinking water and food.

The disruption of mobile connectivity and electricity supply continued on Friday as well.

Since most of the major bridges in the district were already submerged, the connectivity between villages and towns remained cut across the district and the vehicular movement disrupted.

Thousands of trucks were found parked on either side of bridges and highway-side at different places.

Trucks were seen parked for kilometres together on the Bidar-Srirangapatana national highway near Saradagi village and between Shahbad and Bhankur.

The Malkhed Bridge remained under the Kagina waters on Friday also cutting the connectivity between Hyderabad and Kalaburagi. In many flood-hit villages, relief centres were opened.

Upon the direction of Deputy Commissioner Vijaya Jyothsna, several district-level officers camped at the mini-Vidhana Soudha coordinating with the field staff.

Ms. Jyothsna also held meeting with key officials at midnight and took stock of the situation.

Ms. Jyothsna, Kalaburagi Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer P. Raja, Additional Commissioner of Public Instruction Nalin Atul, Kalaburagi Municipal Corporation Commissioner Lokhande Snehal Sudhakar, and other officers visited the Saradagi Barrage and some of the flood-hit villages.

As per the information provided by the administration, the authorities were releasing 3,761 cusecs water from Amarja, 14,400 cusecs from Bennethora, 3,020 cusecs from Lower Mullamari, and 11,333 cusecs from Karanja (in Bidar district) on Friday morning.

People shifted

As many as 12,114 people from 32 villages along the banks of the Bhima have been shifted to safer places. The district administration has identified 157 flood-prone villages in Afzalpur, Jewargi, Kalaburagi, Chittapur, and Shahbad taluks and cautioned the people.

The administration has also opened 117 relief centres and 17,776 people have taken shelter. It has identified 55 government hostels for shifting.

Ms. Jyothsna had appointed a Nodal Officer for each taluk to coordinate among the different government functionaries on the flood-related matters.

On Friday, three NDRF teams were working. As many as 101 swimmers from Home Guards, diving experts, boat operators and flood rescuing trainers were deployed. According to the administration estimate, around 10,000 houses were flooded in the district.

The administration clarified that no loss of human life has been reported.

99,2020/10/17,When floodwaters cut off people of Muttuga from the outside world,"It was two days of isolation with no potable water, food or power supply for them

People of Muttuga village in Kalaburagi district were a relieved lot on Friday as they managed to reconnect with the external world after two days of complete isolation and despair. Ever since the floodwaters of the Kagina entered about 500 houses of this village on Tuesday night, they have had to go without food, potable water, power supply or telephone connectivity.

Every one of the about 500 houses was inundated by the Kagina, a tributary of the Bhima, destroying food and other belongings. As the raging waters entered their homes destroying everything in its path, some people climbed to the roofs of their houses and others rushed to safer places that were on a relatively higher altitude.

“We ate a few biscuits that we had managed to save and drank the floodwater because there was no other choice. We had to spend nights in complete darkness and fear as there was no electricity. Since all mobile networks were dead, we could not contact any outsider for help. None from outside, including government servants, reached the village,” said Nagamma Natikar from the village. They are very worried about the future since most of the stocked grain and acres of standing crop are destroyed, besides buildings and houses.

After the floodwaters receded on Friday, the bridge emerged out of the river, restoring the physical connectivity. Electricity supply was not yet restored when The Hindu visited the village. The river was still in spate and gusty winds made even standing in an open area hard.

Honagunta is another village on the bank of the Kagina that was similarly hit by the floods. Situated at the point where the Kagina joins the Bhima, the village was flooded by both the rivers. Over 500 houses were inundated on Thursday night, destroying everything stocked. Though the village was surrounded by the floodwaters, people did not have water to drink.

When some government officials visited the village on Friday, an angry mob even attempted to assault them. The police had to intervene and pacify the mob with the assurance of providing drinking water. Within an hour, a water tank reached the village and people carrying empty pots were seen rushing towards it.

The overflowing Kagina has flooded over 3,000 acres of agricultural fields with red gram, cotton, sugarcane, and other crops in and around Honagunta. Hundreds of trucks could be seen parked for kilometres on Bidar–Srirangapatna national highway near Saradagi village as the connecting bridge near Jewargi was submerged in the Bhima waters.

Living in fear

Though the Kagina waters receded on Friday, the Bhima continued to be in spate as water at the rate of over 6 lakh cusecs was being released from the Sonna barrage.

Since a large quantum of water is being released from reservoirs in Maharashtra, the water level in the Bhima is expected to rise further. Villagers continue to live in fear of getting flooded yet again.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uh92h8/article32877343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGFARMLAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/when-floodwaters-cut-off-people-of-muttuga-from-the-outside-world/article32877344.ece

Yadgir and Raichur districts have not got any respite from the flood situation on Friday despite no rain.

The Bhima and the Krishna were in spate and agriculture fields were inundated with standing crops, such as paddy, cotton and red gram, destroyed. Road connectivity was cut off as the bridge near Malagatti submerged. Traffic was diverted to an alternative route.

Nearly 2,000 in both districts were been damaged in rain-related incidents.

In Yadgir, 2,163 hectares of standing crops were destroyed between October 1 and 15. As many as 45 villages in Shahpur, Yadgir, and Wadagera taluks are facing a serious threat of flood.

Hurasagundagi village in Shahapur taluk has been almost inundated by the backwaters of the Sannathi bridge constructed across the Bhima. Deputy Commissioner R. Ragapriya has already issued an alert notice and asked the people to shift to the Kalaji Kendra.

However, officials have already shifted 513 families.

“These 45 villages will face a serious flood threat as there is a possibility of the outflow from the Sonna barrage in Kalaburagi district rising. Therefore, residents of river bank villages should not go near the river,” she said.

She added that all precautionary measures have been put in place as officials of the police, the Revenue, and other related departments are ready to face any situation, she added.

The Deputy Commissioner also visited the Kalaji Kendra and inspected the facilities and spoke to the people housed there.

The district administration has been using hostels and school buildings to set up Kalaji Kendras.

There was 2.85 lakh cusecs of water discharged from the Sannathi barrage to the Bhima and there was 2.85 lakh cusecs of inflow.

The road connectivity between Raichur and Shahpur will be cut off if the outflow from Basavasagar is raised to over 2 lakh cusecs to the Krishna as the bridge between Huvindagi-Kollur will be submerged, offcials said. Currently the outflow is 1.92 lakh cusecs and villages in Deodurg, Lingsugur, and Raichur are facing the threat of floods.

Role models

Prevention was better than cure and hence everyone should follow COVID-19 protocol of wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, frequently washing hands etc. Government employees besides taking oath to follow COVID-19 guidelines, should follow them to become model to others.

The Deputy Commissioner said COVID-19 awareness should be conducted at every government event.

Mr. Jagadeesha said bus operators should ensure the vehicle was sanitised every day while passengers wear masks during transit. Similarly, temple managements should ensure devotees wear masks and sanitise their hands before entering temples. Teachers, during the online classes should also create awareness among students about COVID-19 protocol.

Awareness

106,2020/10/17,BJP leader calls on Vellappally,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader P.K. Krishnadas called on Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan at the latter’s residence at Kanichukulangara here on Saturday.

The visit assumes significance as Mr. Natesan had recently criticised the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government for not appointing an Ezhava community member as Vice Chancellor of the newly launched Sree Narayana Guru Open University in Kollam.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr. Krishnadas said the Communist Party of India (Marxist) {CPI (M)} had always disrespected Sree Narayana Guru. The appointment of Vice Chancellor in the open university was the latest example.

“With an eye on the vote bank, the CPI(M) has implemented a religious agenda of Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel. The SNDP Yogam general secretary, who opposed the LDF government’s stance, was criticised by the Muslim League, an ally of the United Democratic Front. The editorial against him in the Muslim League mouthpiece Chandrika shows that both the CPI(M) and the Muslim League have joined hands. The Muslim League is in love with the CPI(M). Their relationship is aided by the Palarivattom flyover scam,” Mr. Krishnadas said.

The BJP national executive committee member said he visited Mr. Natesan to congratulate him for being elected as SN Trust secretary for the ninth consecutive time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bjp-leader-calls-on-vellappally/article32883332.ece
107,2020/10/17,Orders issued to dismiss 385 doctors,"Unauthorised absence from service

The government has issued orders removing from service 432 employees of the Health Service, including 385 doctors, for unauthorised absence from service.

An official release issued by the office of Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said the steps to dismiss these employees were taken as they had not shown any inclination to rejoin service despite several opportunities.

At a time when the COVID pandemic necessitated an increased requirement of human resources in the Health Department, the unauthorised absence of employees was preventing the Health Service from recruiting additional personnel.

Earlier, 36 doctors in the Medical Education Service too had been dismissed from service for unauthorised absence.

Directives had been given to the department to find those employees on unauthorised absence and take stringent disciplinary action against them, Ms. Shylaja said in the statement.

The 385 doctors being dismissed included probationers and permanent employees. The other 47 employees included health inspectors, pharmacists, filaria inspector, staff nurses, nursing assistants, dental hygienists, lab technicians, radiographers, optometrists, hospital attenders, record librarians, PHN tutor, and clerks.

At a time when COVID-9 was ravaging through the State and thousands of healthcare workers are tirelessly working on the front lines for disease containment and patient care, it cannot be justified that so many are staying away. The absence of human resources in these committed posts has been hampering health service delivery and at the same time depriving employment opportunities of many others, the statement said.

Though these employees had been given several opportunities to rejoin service and the matter advertised widely through various media, very few had replied and fewer had joined back.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/orders-issued-to-dismiss-385-doctors/article32883313.ece
108,2020/10/17,"The story of PB No. 9, the oldest postbox number active in Kerala","PB No. 9 has its roots in the Raj era of plantation life in Munnar.

PB No. 9 (Postbox Number 9) has a rare significance in the history of postal services in the State. It is the oldest postbox number still active in Kerala and it has completed a century now.

PB No. 9 has its roots in the Raj era of plantation life in Munnar. Here, postal services were started to reach letters and material from Britain to the staff at its plantations in the present Devikulam taluk. Later, its services were extended to workers mostly brought from Tamil Nadu. In course of time, the post offices merged with India Post.

As per records, PB No 9 was started in 1920 and is still being used to provide service to the staff and family members of Kanan Devan Hills Plantation Ltd at a radius of 35 km from Munnar town.

Munnar postmaster K. Murugaiah says it is the oldest post box number in use in Kerala. It was discovered as part of an enquiry held in connection with the Postal Week celebrations.

The Munnar post office started functioning from the new building in 1932 and it was then under the Madurai division. As per records, post offices were started at Munnar and Devikulam in 1888 and 1892 respectively. The post office at Thalayar was started in 1898 and is still functioning from a British-era building at Thalayar in Devikulam taluk.

According to Mr. Murugaiah, Devikulam was the main town then and in old Munnar there was only one ‘satharam’ (lodge) and it was surrounded by plantations.

Kiran Mathew, a native of Devikulam, who has studied the British-era plantation history, says plantation workers still depend on postal services to keep in touch with their native places.

Mr. Mathew says there was an anchal path (path used by postal runners called anchalottakaran) across the border with Tamil Nadu at Bodimettu. The British were keen on building a communication network in Munnar as it was required for the tea business. Tea prices were decided in London market and it was needed to be passed on to production units in Devikulam.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9ngx2e/article32883303.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvpost,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/the-story-of-pb-no-9/article32883297.ece
109,2020/10/17,"At 17.31%, test positivity rate high in Kerala","9,016 fresh cases when 52,067 samples tested taking cumulative to 3,34,228

The State on Saturday reported 9,016 new COVID-19 cases, when 52,067 samples were tested in the past 24 hours, taking the cumulative case burden to 3,34,228.

The number of recoveries registered on Saturday is 7,991. The test positivity rate of the day is 17.31%, higher than the 14.05% reported the previous day.

However, after testing as many as 73,816 samples on October 7, the highest number of samples processed in a day so far, the subsequent days showed the testing drop to as low as 38,259 samples on October 12.

After October 12, the number of samples tested in a day has barely gone above 50,000.

The sudden drop in testing has been attributed to the technical glitches in the new Lab Diagnosis and Management System which requires an elaborate data entry process.

The total samples tested in a day, as given out by the Health Department, is an ambiguous figure which does not specify the number of tests done daily to detect new cases.

Since the total samples processed in a day also includes repeat sample tests as well as the antigen tests done prior to discharging patients (which on an average has been 7,500-8,000 a day), the actual number of samples tested to detect new infections daily must be a little over 40,000 only.

If this fact is taken into account, the actual test positivity rate in the State must be way over the projected 17.3%, indicating the extent of disease transmission in the community.

The number of recoveries so far has been 2,36,989. The number of active cases at present is 96,004, of whom 756 patients are critically ill and being treated in ICUs, with 180 of them requiring ventilator support.

The Health Department added 26 more deaths which occurred in the past several days to the official death list on Saturday, taking the cumulative toll to 1,139.

Thiruvananthapuram reported seven of these deaths, four in Malappuram, three each in Kollam, Kottayam and Thrissur, two each in Kozhikode and Alappuzha and one each in Ernakulam and Kannur.

Of the new cases reported on Saturday, 98.5% cases – 8,889 cases – are locally acquired infections, including the 1,321 cases wherein the source of infection remains untraced. These include infections contracted by 104 health-care workers also.

Among districts, Malappuram’s case graph continues to climb with 1,519 cases. Thrissur follows with 1,109, Ernakulam 1,022, Kozhikode 926, Thiruvananthapuram 848, Palakkad 688, Kollam 656, Alappuzha 629, Kannur 464, Kottayam 411, Kasaragod 280, Pathanamthitta 203, Idukki 140 and Wayanad 121 cases.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/c76ptc/article31937448.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KERALACOVIDCORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/at-1731-test-positivity-rate-high-in-state/article32882573.ece
110,2020/10/17,Probe reaches Sivasankar’s doorsteps,"Customs to seek a medical opinion before questioning him further

The Customs (Preventive) is reportedly set to question M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, on suspicion of using the heft of his office to aid gold smuggling case suspect Swapna Suresh to convert the proceeds from the economic offence into foreign currency and spirit it away to Dubai.

Opposition parties, particularly the BJP, claimed that the move by the Customs to detain Mr. Sivasankar underscored the allegation that organised crime had access to the highest level of the State government. Mr. Sivasankar, who was suspended for misconduct, had often reported directly to the Chief Minister.

Parallel investigations by the Customs and Enforcement Directorate (ED) into the shadowy finances of the gold smuggling racket had reached the doorstep of Mr. Sivasankar on Friday evening.

Armed with a summons, Customs agents escorted Mr. Sivasankar into a car for transit to the Commissionerate in Kochi for questioning. Enroute, Mr. Sivasankar reported sick, and they hospitalised him.

The Customs was likely to seek the constitution of a medical board to gauge Mr. Sivasankar's health before executing its summons for interrogation. The manager of a private bank which handled the consulate's account had reportedly told ED that Swapna had pressurised him to convert vast amounts of Indian currency into US dollars in violation of RBI norms and FEMA provisions.

Swapna, who was an influential official at the diplomatic mission at the time, threatened that she would shift the consulate's account to another bank if the manager did not comply with her demand. He alleged that Mr. Sivasankar had thrown the heft of his office behind Swapna.

Concurrently, the Customs also perused immigration department documents and ""found"" that Mr. Sivasankar had travelled to Dubai along with Swapna several times during the 2017-19 period. The agencies suspect that Swapna used the trips to smuggle foreign currency out of the country.

Investigators were tight-lipped about the exact charges Mr. Sivasankar would face, if at all. They said they wanted to find out whether he had colluded with Swapna to launder the proceeds from crime and helped her smuggle it abroad.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ndwvkj/article32212912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvgad02-SivasGUP7JG56I5jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/probe-reaches-sivasankars-doorsteps/article32882062.ece
111,2020/10/17,People’s collective seeks Kerala journalist’s release,"Kappan’s wife demands CM’s intervention

A people’s collective held here on Saturday demanded the release of journalist Siddeek Kappan from detention in Uttar Pradesh.

Mr. Kappan, who is secretary of the Delhi unit of the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ), was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police from Mathura on October 6 while he was on his way to Hathras for covering the gang-rape and murder of a Dalit woman.

Mr. Kappan’s wife Raihanath, his two children and brother were among those who joined the collective. T.N. Prathapan, MP, inaugurated the programme. KPCC general secretary Noushad Ali organised the gathering.

Mr. Prathapan said the arrest and detention of Mr. Kappan was a pointer to the increasing incidence of anti-democratic tendencies across the country. He called upon the people to join hands to resist the anti-democratic behaviour of the government.

Senior journalist N.P. Chekkutty said Mr. Kappan’s arrest reflected the increasing fascist tendencies in the country. He said the U.P. government arrested Mr. Kappan to divert the attention of the world from the human rights violations taking place in that State.

Ms. Raihanath demanded the intervention of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for the release of her husband. She said nobody from the State administration had offered them even a word of solace. “If it is Mr. Siddeek today, it can be anyone of you tomorrow,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/peoples-collective-seeks-kerala-journalists-release/article32881798.ece
112,2020/10/17,Joseph not to cede seats to Cong.,"‘Almost all leaders from the Mani group have joined our ranks’

The plans of the Congress to expand its presence in Central Travancore using the space vacated by the Kerala Congress (M) led by Jose K. Mani appears to have suffered a setback with the rival faction led by P.J. Joseph asserting its right over all seats that traditionally belonged to the regional party.

Talking to media persons on Saturday, Mr. Joseph said the seats where the Mani faction had contested during the previous local body elections now belonged to his party. The stand would be the same for the Assembly elections as well.

“Ideally, the seats vacated by the Mani group should be left to us as almost all leaders from the Mani group have joined our ranks. For, it will be the most suitable option to ensure a drubbing to the Mani group and the matter will be discussed in detail within the UDF,’’ he said.

Mr. Joseph unleashed a scathing attack on Mr. Mani and his close aid Roshy Augustine, MLA, terming the Mani group as a country boat lost at sea.

The statement assumes significance as reports have emerged that the Congress, as the leading partner of the UDF, looks set to take back seats, including Kanjirappally and Changanassery, from the KC(M) in view of a decline in its collective bargaining power.

The number of seats at its disposal will come down further in case of the Kerala Janapaksham led by P.C. George, MLA, and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), an LDF ally that currently faces the prospects of losing Pala and Kuttanad to the Mani group, decide to align with the UDF.

Mr. Joseph, on the other hand, will be hard-pressed to ensure seats for at least a handful of leaders who switched from the various splinter groups of the regional party to join him recently. An array of leaders, including Johny Nellore, Francis George and Joseph M. Puthussery, have joined Mr. Joseph during his bid to consolidate the position as the biggest among the Kerala Congress groups.

Meanwhile, in a related development, the Mani faction sought to dismiss the allegations raised by Mr. Joseph over the selection of candidates for the Pala byelection. In a statement, N. Jayaraj, MLA, said the confirmation by Mr. Joseph that he had send a letter to the Central Election Commission seeking not to issue the party symbol to the KC(M) candidate for the Pala byelection revealed the extent of a `political betrayal' witnessed by the State.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/joseph-not-to-cede-seats-to-cong/article32881761.ece
113,2020/10/17,KSEB against Centre’s power privatisation moves,"State says power is part of Concurrent list and it has no intentions of privatising sector

The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has raised strong objections to the draft standard bidding documents (SBD) for the privatisation of State-owned power distribution companies published by the Union Power Ministry.

The State government-run power utility has informed the Ministry that Kerala has no intention, whatsoever, of privatising its power sector.

In an October 8 letter to the Secretary, Power Ministry, the KSEB has drawn attention to the Ministry’s own observation that “Under the Indian Constitution, power is a Concurrent subject and the responsibility for distribution and supply of power to rural and urban consumers rests with the States.”

The draft SBD encroached upon the domain of the States and attempts to dictate the ways and means for privatisation of the utilities owned by them, KSEB chairman and managing director N.S. Pillai said in the letter.

The Union Ministry had released the draft in September to guide the States in the privatisation of state-owned distribution companies (discoms). The Centre is already going ahead with plans to privatise discoms in the Union Territories by January 2021.

It was for long been the declared stand of Kerala that its power sector would be retained in the public sector. Several of the draft proposals are unfair, and, if implemented, would entail additional burden on the state and the public, the KSEB noted.

The KSEB objected to such draft proposals which would require transfer of assets and employees to the “successor entity”, the share-holding pattern, and the transfer of only profitable power purchase agreements (PPA) of existing discoms to the successor entities. The draft SBD went on to suggest that the “successor entity will be provided with a clean balance sheet free of accumulated losses/ unserviceable liabilities. Further, wherever required, the concerned State/UT government may provide suitable transition support to the successor entity for a specified period of say 5 or 7 years.”

Further, the KSEB pointed out that it was doing well on all fronts including customer service, affordable tariff, and loss reduction. But for the 2018 and 2019 floods and the COVID-19 pandemic, the utility would have recorded a profit. It also claimed to have avoided load restrictions since 2015. “During 2017 itself, at a stage when the rest of the nation was struggling to electrify most of its villages, Kerala achieved 100% household electrification. Today, there are no hamlets in the State where electricity has not reached,” it noted.

The KSEB suggested to the Ministry that the draft be revised limiting the applicability of the SBD to discoms in the Union Territories.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kseb-against-centres-power-privatisation-moves/article32881511.ece
114,2020/10/17,Houseboats to begin operations today,"Tourists should register on COVID-19 Jagratha portal before checking in

Houseboats will start operating adhering to COVID-19 protocols and guidelines from Sunday.

Tourists should register on COVID-19 Jagratha portal before checking into a houseboat. They will be allowed into the vessel after checking the body temperature and disinfecting their luggage.

As part of restrictions, check-in will be allowed only at Punnamada Finishing Point and Pallathuruthy houseboat terminals. A maximum of 10 passengers will be permitted in a boat, while only two persons will be allowed in a room. Village walks will not be allowed. Both the check-in and check-out should be done between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.

Houseboat owners have been directed to disinfect the vessels after each trip. They should ensure that the boat crew and tourists should not come in close contact and install a partition separating the driver’s cabin. All houseboats should display COVID-19 Jagratha portal QR code.

Authorities said that a squad was formed to check violations. Stringent action would be taken against violators, said an official.

Kevin Rozario, general secretary, All Kerala Houseboat Owners and Operators Samithi, said that a large number of vessels would not be operation ready on Sunday and the following days as they were yet to complete the maintenance. “Houseboats have remained idle for the past seven months. To make it run again, we need to spend a good amount. Several owners are struggling to carry out the maintenance due to financial constraints. The State government should immediately provide the already announced maintenance grant for houseboats,” he said.

Mr. Kevin also urged the authorities concerned to initiate action against illegal houseboats, a few of them already started plying the backwaters after the government opened the tourism sector in the State on October 12.

Although houseboats are ready to sail, both the houseboat operators and Tourism Department are not expecting an influx of tourists any time soon. “There are only minimal inquiries and bookings. It will take time before the sector achieves some normality,” said a Tourism Department official.

Earlier, after the pandemic severely hit the business, several houseboat owners and employees have turned to other jobs to make a living.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2wc2h2/article32881529.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tval2--HB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/houseboats-to-begin-operations-today/article32881414.ece
115,2020/10/17,Actor rape case: WCC urges CM to intervene,"Concern at move to shift trial to another court

Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) has sought the intervention of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to end the inordinate delay in ensuring justice for the victim in the actor rape case.

In a social media post on Saturday, the WCC termed the news that the prosecution has moved the court to stop the proceedings and shift the trial to another court fearing that the survivor will not get fair trial and justice as ‘shocking.' It is learnt that the Special Public Prosecutor believed that the court was highly biased, said the Collective.

The WCC pointed out that “it was a tragedy to sow uncertainties in a case where our colleague remains waiting for justice to be delivered in the case reported three years back. We request the Chief Minister and the society to intervene and put an end to this deadlock. It's not the responsibility of the government alone to resolve the inordinate delay in getting justice. We remind everyone that it's the responsibility of all who are concerned about the future of the girls and women in the country,” it said.

116,2020/10/17,"Perspective of the pellet victims, literally","The Broken Camera follows a photojournalist whose retina was torn by a pellet fire in Kashmir

Xuhaib Maqbool Hamza holds a broken camera in his hands and says: “I have two blurred lenses. This one in my hand and another in my body.” Four years ago, the photojournalist was in the middle of covering a protest in Kashmir, when a pellet fire from a member of the security personnel pierced his body and eyes, permanently altering the way he viewed the world, through his camera’s viewfinder as well as the naked eye.

Malayali documentary filmmaker Gopal Menon’s latest work The Broken Camera tells the story of that dark day and how he managed to get back to photography. The film has now been selected to be screened at the Australia-based My Rode Reel International Short Film Festival that attracts entries from across the world.

In the film, Mr. Hamza recounts the events of September 4, 2016, when he saw a policeman coming towards him with a pellet gun. He had raised his camera as well as his press card to signal that he is a photojournalist out to perform his duty. Yet, a minute later, he found himself reeling on the ground with a body ridden with pellets all the way from the knees to the head. He has had two major surgeries till date, but after the latest one his doctors told him that he could not expect further improvement in his eye. His retina was torn.

‘Ongoing project’

“For me, this is a part of an ongoing project. I have been documenting the issues in Kashmir since 1998. In 2000, I had made a film called Papa 2, on the enforced disappearances of civilians. During that time, I had also made another documentary titled Wounded Valley. Since 2016, I have been working on another Kashmir-based project. Hamza’s story, which was part of that project, was turned into this short film,” says Mr. Menon

Before he lost his eye, Mr. Hamza, in addition to being a news photographer, was also an acclaimed nature photographer, fashion photographer, and a radio jockey. The short film also chronicles his painful return to photography. His friends inspired him to buy a new camera, with which he began shooting commercial projects. Following the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in 2019, he came out on the streets to shoot photographs again, from the initial days of people’s protests against the move. “This project is all about how I see with the left eye. This is the perspective of the pellet victims. These images are horrifying,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/zffd2a/article32881261.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/xuhaib-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/perspective-of-the-pellet-victims-literally/article32881262.ece

118,2020/10/17,Gold smuggling case: BJP demands Pinarayi’s resignation,"Government trying to hush up case, says Muraleedharan

The BJP on Friday demanded the resignation of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan over the gold smuggling case, alleging that those accused in the case were working in tandem with the ruling dispensation in the State.

“The moral authority of the Chief Minister is lost. The BJP has been demanding, the people of Kerala have been demanding that the Chief Minister resign owning moral responsibility for the whole incident,” Minister of State for External Affairs and Kerala BJP leader V. Muraleedharan said at a presser at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi.

The case relates to the seizure of 30 kg of gold from diplomatic baggage at the Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5.

Mr. Muraleedharan said the Left government’s involvement in hushing up the case was clear by the fact that the State had first asked the Centre to order a probe into the matter and had now moved court against the CBI, claiming that the agency does not have the authority to investigate.

“This shows that those involved in smuggling gold are hand in glove with those in power,” he alleged, adding that this case was distinct from other cases of gold smuggling because it was “directly” linked to the Chief Minister’s Office. He also pointed out that the Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister had been suspended over the case.

“(Chief Minister) Vijayan has been changing his stand on the matter from the day the case was registered and accused were arrested,” Mr. Muraleedharan said.

120,2020/10/17,Vaccination against KFD to be intensified in Wayanad,"Disease spread likely to peak from November to April

A district-level meeting of senior officials chaired by District Collector Adeela Abdulla here on Friday decided to intensify vaccination against Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) or monkey fever in Wayanad.

Three persons had died of the disease, and 29 KFD cases were reported in the district last season. Since the outbreak of the viral disease, transmitted to humans through a species of ticks found on monkeys, had been mainly reported from hamlets near forests, the public should be vigilant, especially during the peak period from November to April, Ms. Abdulla said.

Health Department officials should adopt all possible steps such as intensifying the vaccination drive and organise awareness programmes in villages to tackle a possible outbreak, she added.

Medicines, including antibiotics, and fluids should be stocked to meet emergency situations. Personal protection equipment including gloves, gumboots, and lotions will be supplied to people in KFD-hit areas, the Collector said.

The disease was mainly reported from five grama panchayats in the district, including Thirunelly, Pulpally, Mullankolly, Poothadi, and Noolpuzha, District Surveillance Officer Savan Sara Mathew said.

Dr. Mathew said that as many as 20,000 people in Thirunelly grama panchayat, where the highest number of KFD cases was reported, were vaccinated against the disease last season.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vaccination-against-kfd-to-be-intensified-in-wayanad/article32877525.ece
121,2020/10/17,"Indulge in activities that stimulate the artistic, emotional and creative side of your brain","Indulge in activities such as dancing, learning music, and acting to stimulate the artistic, emotional and creative side of your brain

Humans possess the largest brain among the vertebrates. Divided into two hemispheres — the left and the right — the human brain takes care of analytical and creative activities. While the left hemisphere deals with analysis, logic and attention, the right takes care of the artistic, emotional and creative side.

Communication lines

Connected by a number of nerve fibres, the two sides communicate with each other to bring out the best in an individual. Activities such as dancing, painting, singing or playing an instrument all stimulate the right hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere can be trained with tasks involving logic, math and analytical thinking.

Online classes

However, with the pandemic-related lockdowns, people are under lot of stress. This is where activities that stimulate the right hemisphere come into play. While there are many online classes for music, painting, dancing and drama, people tend to wonder if these will be as effective as physical classes. However, with technological advances, these classes are equally beneficial. On-the-spot feedback is possible, and one is not bound by geographical limitations. Students and teachers could be living in different places, yet they can connect for classes. One can also use the Internet for reference and examples. Another factor is saving time. One does not need to travel for a class.

For many, especially children, such activities have all-round development effects that are important in the growing years. Dance, for instance, keeps one fit and flexible and also helps improve memory. Similarly, learning to play a musical instrument makes the child creative, sharp-witted, improves concentration and builds confidence. Apart from ensuring that both hemispheres of the brain are in harmony, such activities help one develop a new skill and cultivate one’s passion. What are you waiting for? Make the most of this time and find a new activity to stimulate the right hemisphere of your brain.

122,2020/10/17,What’s your story?,"If you are a baffled student staring at essay prompts and Statements of Purpose for college applications, here is a quick primer

Why do they want to read my essay? To know you and your story. Clearly, marks as a sole criteria for entry is unfair, as demonstrated by the Delhi University (DU) cut-offs. Instead, a “holistic” admission process sees marks across various years, your personality and communication skills as judged by essays, interviews, case studies and group discussions. Here is an overview of how to approach college-application essays:

Personal essays

What is important to you? Describe a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What is unique about your background or community? Describe a difficult event, failure or setback that changed your perspective and personality. The common thread is that they are “personal”.

Unfortunately, Indian education systems teach us to write essays that are formal and structured and most students end up using these prompts to boast about themselves.

Make a shift. Think about those moments, stories and ideas that you rarely talk about to anyone. Like, I wonder why adults lie. You may end up writing a beautiful story on how you learnt about the impact of truth — and lies.

Some pointers:

Be personal and authentic. It is much easier to tell a real story than to manufacture one.

Share your vulnerabilities and insights, rather than brag about your achievements.

Focus on positives. Not how your faith in humanity was eroded by your best friend cheating on you. Talk about how you learnt to stand up for yourself while not judging others.

Try to be original. Avoid clichéd stories like recovery after sports injuries, unless you have a truly unique perspective.

Statement of Purpose

Almost every college application will need some version of what do you want to study and why? And why in our college?

This needs a specific and in-depth response on which areas you find interesting and would like to delve deeper into. Specific courses in that college, research projects you may have done, books you have read, courses taken both within and outside your school and college curriculum, and seminars attended are all relevant.

What makes or breaks such an essay is specificity. For example, writing ‘I like Economics because it gives practical perspectives on the world’ is vague. Instead, ‘I like to study economic development theories and have been exploring the impact of liberalisation on poverty in India’ is specific. Saying, ‘I like Psychology because I like to understand people’ is vague but saying, ‘I want to study abnormal psychology and art therapy to recover from trauma’ is specific.

Overall, the key to RAISE the level of your essays is:

Research the subject you intend to study to understand sub-topics and current areas of research. Read other winning essays; the Internet is teaming with them.

Authenticity: Be you. Say what has not been said before. Give them a glimpse into the real you.

In-depth: Go into the details of courses, incidents, research topics, books, seminars... Avoid vague, superficial statements.

Simplicity: Avoid big words and “flowery” language.

Editing: Keep sentences short and crisp, no more than 25 words each. Proofread to remove all spelling and grammatical errors.

Writing college essays can be a gruelling experience, but many students find that it gives them more clarity and confidence. So, immerse yourself into the journey joyfully. At best, you will find yourself! At worst, well, you may get into the college of your dreams!

123,2020/10/17,Self-reliance is the way forward,"How universities in India are getting ready for a changing educational and industrial landscape

With the pandemic impacting schools and colleges, educational institutions have begun to think out-of-the-box to meet the challenges of digital learning, and to create cultures where innovative thinking is inspired and nurtured. They also have to prepare students for a rapidly-changing job market and make them self-reliant. To succeed, universities too need to be self-reliant. Here is how they are doing this.

New dimension to the incubator-entrepreneurship model: In the pre-COVID era, academic institutions focused on training their students in skills required in larger companies. But Atmanirbhar Bharat has moved the focus to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Ignoring this sector would be a lost opportunity. In developing nations across the world, MSMEs have engaged with academia by investing in research and innovation, a relationship that can benefit both institutions and industry.

Innovation, a major objective: With the help of advanced Artificial Intelligence and IoT, Indian universities have taken up the challenge of finding innovative solutions to the problems raised by COVID-19.

Sustainable employment: Industry relies on academia to train the talent required for the workplace and to ensure lifelong learning. Our educational institutes have begun following the “Experiential University” model to ensure that the students are job- and industry-ready.

124,2020/10/17,Testing times,"With educational institutions turning to online assessments during the pandemic, here’s how to prepare for exams on this new platform

Taking exams has never been this disorienting, due to the pandemic-related closure of educational institutions. While cancelling exams is an easy way out, universities and policymakers have to ensure that the years of hard work that students have put into their courses are not wasted or devalued. Also, employers want an assurance that the measures taken by universities during the pandemic does not lead to lower standards.

Among the many options being evaluated are online assessments. But the sudden shift will come with its own challenges, both for the institution and its students. But a little forethought can reduce the stress. Here are a few tips for students:

Prepare yourself: Before you start your online assessment, know how long you have to complete it. Does the exam start at a set time or is there a time frame within which you can take it? How many questions do you need to answer? Is there any negative marking? Is there a word limit for descriptive questions? Knowing all this in advance will help.

Manage environment and distractions: Identify a space for the online exam and de-clutter as much as possible. Use headphones, if you have questions with audio/video. Ensure your device is fully charged and that you have access to a charging station.

Manage time: Know how much time you have and plan how long you should take to complete each section/question. If the exam is a flexi-time one, consider avoiding times when your Internet is usually slow or unreliable.

Manage technology: Do you have the required technology set up? Take the test on a laptop/desktop, if possible, as a larger screen, a full keyboard and a powerful CPU are better. Use a Wi-Fi or a broadband connection to ensure stability; a 3G/4G connection can be erratic. Do verify that your mic and camera are working before you start.

Learn about remote proctoring: Most online assessment platforms will record your screen, the camera and the mic for the duration of the exam. You won’t be able to access any other application during that time and human proctors will be watching. Focus on your screen, do not use mobile phones, ensure that you have a quiet place and ensure that no one else comes close (as the camera may identify that as inappropriate).

Understand the pattern: Ask your teacher if there are sections with fixed time limits, if you can go back to revise a section, whether your answers are auto-submitted while you are writing them, or any other doubts you may have.

Manage emergencies: A computer or Internet fault may lead to being disconnected. Check ahead what you should do if this happens.

Ask for mock tests: Most universities organise mock tests for students to familiarise themselves with the technology. Ensure that you don’t miss these so that you know all the tools, techniques and the controls on the platform. This also helps remove any technical glitches due to system incompatibility.

Know the helpdesk: Last-minute technical problems are not unheard of. Know whom to contact in this situation.

Manage exam stress: Planning for your exams well in advance, a little practice on the platform, and a knowledge of the dos and don’ts will help reduce stress.

Online exams work with an assumption that all students have access to reliable Wi-Fi, dependable computers or a quiet space. Hence, moving examinations online without proper counselling and support for the students can put certain groups at a disadvantage.

However, with advance planning, some preparation and practice, most students should be able to smoothly navigate online exams.

125,2020/10/17,Have you completed your cybersecurity homework?,"With technology now being the enabler of education, staying safe online too must become part of school culture

The pandemic has transformed the traditional classroom model to a digital screen — a single pane for the entire education system. With classrooms operating virtually, students and teachers are exposing themselves to more cyber risks than they realise. Educational institutions have long been a target for malicious actors and this has been validated by recent research that names education and manufacturing as the most targeted sectors since the pandemic.

Is security the backbencher?

Lack of awareness and weak policies governing the space make the education sector alarmingly vulnerable to cyber threats. Shortage of resources and technology investment further deepens the problem. There is a pressing need to maintain control over how the influx of data is used, stored, and shared inside and outside of the virtual class. As students and teachers operate from less controlled environments outside of school, the need to educate them on basics such as phishing and cyberbullying, and inculcating overall cybersecurity hygiene is imperative.

Government initiatives like CSC help students understand the implications of security in the digital world through interactive workshops and trainings that help them make responsible and informed decisions in cyberspace. However, there is a lot more to be done and only by prioritising these conversations at the grassroots can we go beyond the tip of the iceberg.

Raising digital citizens

Online scams are successful because they ride on emotional vulnerabilities and behavioural limitations. Parents and teachers need to empower students with information and strategies to defend themselves online. Cybersafety must be discussed often, and with due seriousness.

The past few months have created the perfect storm for online predators. Young learners and first-time users on insecure networks are exposed to malware or phishing.

What you can do: Never click unsolicited links included in emails, text messages, or screen pop-ups. Even if you know the sender, scrutinise the email/text before you reply. Just like the real world, beware of ‘digital stranger danger’ in the virtual one. Do not to befriend strangers, send them personal photos/videos, no matter how much they insist.

There is a possibility of cyberbullying or cyberharassment from known and unknown people online. Remember, all online content is permanent. Even if you try deleting it, there is still a record floating around in the cyberworld. It is imperative that kids pay close attention to all posts, videos, and images they upload.

What you can do: Engage in safe social networking and avoid giving out too much personal information. Maximise privacy settings on social profiles and delete any post that unintentionally gives away personal data. Consider removing the names of family members, school, home town, and birthdays.

Other tips: Strong passwords are an essential. Use complex catchphrases and combinations of letters, characters, and numbers. Opt for two-factor authentication to add another layer of protection between you and a potential attacker. As devices are often used across family members, it is critical that security software is present on all endpoints, minimising the risk of attack vectors. Scrutinise websites and downloads. Only trust websites with HTTPS in the URL, instead of HTTP, as the ‘S’ stands for secure.

As technology is now the enabler of education, cybersecurity too must be part of the school culture, embedded in the way we teach, and the way we learn. The schools of the future have already arrived. When we don’t treat cybersecurity as a safety issue, we invite cybercriminals into our homes, classrooms and our lives.

126,2020/10/17,Overseas options,"Sumeet Jain, the founder of Yocket, talks about the findings from a recent survey on studying abroad

Much like other industries, the education sector was thrown off course, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, and lakhs of students who aspired to go abroad for their higher education witnessed their plans come to a screeching halt. ‘What next? Which courses do we opt for? Which countries are safe?’ were some inevitable questions that cropped up. To allay their doubts, online platform Yocket recently conducted a survey with a sample size of 123,309 students, regarding studying abroad. Sumeet Jain, the founder of Yocket, spoke to Education Plus about the findings and prospects of foreign studies.

Trends over time

Yocket’s main aim, he says, is to foster aspirations to study abroad, so, “it is crucial for us to observe changing trends. We also wanted to examine the impact of COVID-19 on this sector. Therefore, data of four years was considered.” The survey looked at pre-COVID (2018-19), COVID (2019-20) and post-COVID (2020-21).

Sumeet believes that students should opt for higher education now. “This is the best time to develop skill-based individuals who can encourage business. Recessions are known to be the best time for people to upskill themselves, as the opportunity cost is low, and people will be well-equipped for when the economy bounces back.”

Top countries

United States: According to the survey, more than 81% of the students aspired to study in the U.S, which until recently had the highest number of COVID-19 cases. “Not every region in the U.S., is as badly affected,” clarifies Sumeet. “Most universities are away from the main cities; most are college towns themselves. Universities are opening up campuses when they are sure of providing a safe environment. Apart from physical distancing measures and regularly sanitising campuses, universities can have a mix of online and on-campus classes.”

Asked about the recent changes to visa criteria, Sumeet points out that, overall, there wasn’t much in the last four years. “The U.S. understands the importance of international students, not just in terms of revenue but also the diversity and the quality they bring to the campuses. Especially after the pandemic, the education sector will get a boost. So, students can definitely expect some positive news post the elections, irrespective of whoever wins.”

Australia: The least number of students (below 2%) wanted to study here. However, there are many reputed colleges and universities with supportive International Student Schemes. “Most of our respondents were people from STEM courses and they prefer the U.S. Also, Australia has a limited number of universities in comparison to the U.S., but is doing well in Accounting and Management-related subjects. Employment opportunities and pay scales are quite high in the U.S, which makes it a more viable option. Many students have also started to consider Canadian and European schools, which explains low numbers for Australia.” Sumeet also feels a post-study work visa will help attract students and hopes that the government will be “student-friendly”, pointing to the constant change in the skilled labour list and the need for employment opportunities for students without Permanent Residence (PR).

Germany: While some universities offer free tuition, most are highly competitive and focus on academic performance. While knowing German is not mandatory, it will definitely make life easier.

United Kingdom: When the post-study visa option was cancelled, numbers dipped. But now that it has been revived, things could improve. But post-Brexit, job opportunities for international students will have to be seen, he says.

STEM vs Humanities: According to the survey, only students with a commerce or science background preferred to study abroad. “Studying abroad is expensive and, often, students have to avail loans. They have to check post-study options to be able to repay it. In the U.S., for instance, the STEM courses have a post-study work visa option of two years; whereas, for the Humanities or Arts, the option is just one year. Getting a job in these sectors can be challenging. So, there is a need for government-sponsored scholarships for these courses. In a post-COVID environment, there will be a number of courses and careers that will be a hybrid of tech and the Humanities. Naturally, tech companies too will start hiring Humanities graduates, which will provide an impetus to pursue it.”

He also says that the four-year graduation mandated by the National Education Policy 2020 will make foreign education more accessible to Indian students. “Many U.S. universities do not accept three-year degrees. Thus, this move will give Indian students more options for post-graduation and higher studies.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/education/cmwuy4/article32880577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19EPBS-Yocket-2,https://www.thehindu.com/education/overseas-options/article32880578.ece
127,2020/10/17,A question of adjustments,"The post-pandemic situation will be challenging, both for students and teachers. A look at the issues that may crop up

Of the current global human population of 7.8 billion in 2020, nearly 1.3 billion are learners who have been affected by the closure of educational institutions due to COVID-19. Such spaces are fundamental not only for academic interactions but also to build social and emotional skills and mental and physical health. As governments contemplate when and how to re-open schools and colleges, it is clear that the post-pandemic situation will be different for both teachers and students.

Resuming classroom

With students and teachers getting used to remote teaching, which has been the norm for much of this year, getting back to the traditional classroom environment will be challenging. One immediate issue will be lack of focus, as students may be distracted by sharing their experiences of life during the lockdowns. This initial hiccup can be overcome by giving them the right orientation.

Psychological stress

Owing to SMS — social distancing, masks and sanitisers, which are the non-negotiable — the classroom environment will be new, difficult and possibly stressful. Students will have to get used to physical distancing instead of sitting close together and joking or playing pranks. Further, students who exhibit symptoms of headache, cough and fever are likely to be suspected to be infected with the Coronavirus. This could lead to some amount of embarrassment.

Lack of excitement

Students who have already begun a new academic year online have lost the charm and excitement of a new classroom environment along with that of getting new uniforms, books and other essentials. Further, a physical connect after a vacation usually is a happy time of sharing experiences of travel and other thrilling moments, none of which was possible this year. Also, educational institutions are considering a shift system so that fewer students will be present in the classroom, leading to smaller groups.

Transition hampered

Students who finished school this year have had their introduction to college through a virtual walk through. This does not really help in showcasing the institution. Also their interactions in the college would have depended on whether they were day scholars or hostel residents. Exposure to cultural, club and other extracurricular activities shape the life of students, but this is not possible now. Authorities and the faculty will have to find solutions to circumvent these problems.

128,2020/10/17,‘The Trial of the Chicago 7’ movie review: A spectacular white-knuckle thrill ride,"Aaron Sorkin’s writing and the absolutely brilliant performances by the ensemble cast make this legal drama a riveting watch

Abbie Hoffman was something of a hero in university. The civil rights activist seemed to be that heady mix of razor-sharp intellect coupled with a puckish sense of fun. So there we were, passing the blistering-hot summer days pouring through newspapers and journals from the ‘60s and ‘70s in the American Studies Research Centre in Secunderabad reading about the exhilarating days of love-ins, beat poets and books that were trips on a magic bus. It was, incidentally, part of our paper on American literature and so one could feel suitably righteous giggling over underground comics and Hoffman’s life story, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture.

When Aaron Sorkin, who has written Broadway plays and Hollywood movies such as A Few Good Men, The Social Network and Charlie Wilson’s War, turned his eyes on the infamous trial of anti-Vietnam protestors, one wondered if the thrill of the glory days of endless possibility could be recreated.

Happily, The Trial of the Chicago 7, which Sorkin has written and directed, has succeeded spectacularly in doing precisely that. The credit for this white-knuckle thrill ride goes to the tight writing and the absolutely brilliant performances by an ensemble cast. In August 1968, a protest against the Vietnam war at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago turned violent.

The Trial of the Chicago 7 Director: Aaron Sorkin

Cast: Sacha Baron Cohen, Daniel Flaherty, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, John Carroll Lynch, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Eddie Redmayne, Noah Robbins, Mark Rylance, Alex Sharp, Jeremy Strong

Run time: 130 minutes

Story line: The infamous trial of the 1960s is brought thrillingly to life

Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Bobby Seale, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, Lee Weiner and John Froines were charged by the Federal government with crossing state lines and conspiracy to incite riot. The case came to court in September, 1969. The Trial of the Chicago 7 follows the trial till the verdict in February 1970 intercutting with the events of August 1968 and Hoffman’s stand-up over the weekends at university campus.

There is no lack of drama during the trial from Seale being bound and gagged in court to the many disruptions. The movie also explores the tensions between the activists. The ensemble cast is extraordinary. From Eddie Redmayne (Hayden), Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the prosecutor, Richard Schultz, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Seale), Michael Keaton as former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, Frank Langella as grumpy Judge Julius Hoffman, John Carroll Lynch (Dellinger), Mark Rylance as defence attorney William Kunstler, Alex Sharp (Davis), Jeremy Strong (Rubin), Noah Robbins (Weiner) and Daniel Flaherty (Froines) breathe life into these characters.

Holding all this incandescent talent together and shining bright as a beacon is Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman. Whether he is teasing the judge with a heartfelt cry of “Father”, when the former says he is not related to Abbie, or recounting the events of the protest saying, “Allan Ginsberg was letting out a war chant to beat poets that they should begin pelting the troops with blank verse,” or making the crucial observation that Hayden “implies possessive pronouns and uses vague noun modifiers” or even quietly admitting “I have never been on trial for my thoughts before,” Cohen is spellbinding.

Cohen, who would soon be seen in the next edition of Borat, has created an unforgettable Hoffman in this prescient tale of the power of an idea.

129,2020/10/17,Suraj Venjaramoodu: It feels good when one’s hard work is recognised,"The Malayalam actor, who recently won the Kerala State Award for Best Actor, looks back at his career so far and the kind of characters he wishes to play in the future

Suraj Venjaramoodu is in the middle of a shoot for Jana Gana Mana with his Driving Licence co-star Prithviraj Sukumaran, when he got the news that he has bagged the 50th Kerala State Film Award for the Best Actor.

Speaking over phone from Kochi, Suraj agrees that 2019 was indeed a good year for him with respect to playing characters and the subsequent box-office successes. He adds that the characters written for him were challenging and helped him stand out. The Kerala State Film Award for his performance in Android Kunjappan Version 5.2 and Vikruthi, is the crowning glory for an actor who came up the hard way.

“Both the films and my characterswere appreciated. That in itself is an award. Now, the State award has come as a bonanza and doubled my joy. It feels good when one’s hard work is recognised. It is a responsibility that is placed on you to better yourself and prove yourself to be worthy of that award,” says Suraj.

After having essayed several comical characters, Suraj says he longed for characters with substance; the ones that would make a difference. “It is only now that I have begun to get the kind of roles I had always wished for!”

Suraj wished to play the character of Bhaskara Poduval in Android Kunjappan when he heard the thread of the story during a programme in Canada nearly a year ago. “The casting was done. Yet, I could not help thinking how wonderful it would be if I could play the cranky octogenarian Poduval. Mahesh Narayanan was supposed to direct this well-knit movie about a cantankerous father and his caring son,” he recalls.

Eventually, there were some changes and scenarist Ratheesh Balakrishnan Poduval came on board as the director. “I was in Thiruvananthapuram for my father’s funeral. Around that time, my producer Santhosh T Kuruvilla called me to ask if I would step into the role of Poduval. As soon as I heard a few scenes of the script, I replied in the affirmative,” recalls Suraj, making no attempt to mask the glee in his voice.

In Vikruthi, Suraj plays Eldho, who has hearing and speech impairments. Incidentally, in both films, Suraj and Soubin Shahir are the lead actors. He ended his 2019 run with Driving Licence, which was a massive success at the box office.

During the lockdown, Suraj was among the few actors who managed to complete two films: Sunil Ibrahim’s Roy and Jeo Baby’s The Great Indian Kitchen, in which he teams with his Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum actor, Nimisha Sajayan.

The long shot

Winner of three State Awards for the Best Comedian, Suraj has come a long way from the time when he was used to lighten the mood of a film by doing slapstick comedy. Even while doing the routine acts, he requested directors he was acquainted with, to give him something that is different.

In 2013, he won the National Award for his poignant performance in Dr Biju’s Perariyathavar, where he played a character from the marginalised community. “However, what was sad was that many did not watch the film in theatres. Even many of my well-wishers might have wondered how and why I got the National Award since they missed it. Their doubts were set to rest with a couple of scenes in Abrid Shine’s Action Hero Biju (2016), in which I played Pavithran, which was far removed from the characters I had essayed up until then,” says Suraj.

That small role did the trick and since then, Suraj has become the Mr Dependable.“At present, I am trying to select characters that excite me.

All eyes are on AMR Ramesh’s Veerappan - Hunger for Killing. The ambitious project will have a pan-Indian release as a four-part film or a web series. As the title suggests, Veerappan - Hunger for Killing tells the story of the forest brigand and the efforts of the Special Task Force to nab him.

Ramesh also directed Attahasa, which was based on Veerappan too. Kishore played the lead in a cast that included Arjun Sarja, Lakshmi Rai and Suchendra Prasad.

Ramesh’s films are always based on fact; he rarely dabbles in fiction. Known as a film maker with a passion for being investigative, he is described by friends and colleagues as a filmmaker who “never lets his heart rule his head when it comes to filmmaking.”

Ramesh talks to MetroPlus about his dream project, the research that went into the making and more.

Excerpts:

Why have you made another film Veerappan after Attahasa?

What I failed to narrate in Attahasa is being fulfilled in Veerappan-Hunger for Killing. While Attahasa was a two-hour film, Veerappan... will either be released as a four-part film or as a web series. We have 12 hours of content and are open to both options. The film is being shot simultaneously in Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Hindi.

This film revolves revolves around Veerappan — the police struggles to nab him. It talks of their sacrifices, hopes and struggles.

Is the story based on facts or is it a work of a fiction?

No fiction at all. The characters are based on real people. The story is built on facts, which I wrote after 15 years of research. I always write my stories and screenplay and they are all based on reality.

You have just completed the first schedule of the shoot...

Yes. We are shooting in real locations. We shot in dense forests but with a limited staff. That was a huge challenge.

Could you tell us about casting Suniel Shetty?

Suniel Shetty plays Shankar Bidri, the man, who, between 1993 and 1996, was instrumental in bringing the number of Veerappan’s gang from 180 to eight. During Bidri’s term, Veerappan went underground and surfaced after he was out of the picture.

Suresh Oberoi plays Dr Rajkumar, Kishore plays Veerappan again while Suchendra Prasad plays the DFO Sreenivas, an honest man who went the extra mile to conserve the forest and was beheaded by Veerappan. We are trying to bring Vivek Oberoi on board too.

How difficult or easy is it to represent reality on screen?

Well, sticking to the truth without taking any creative liberties has always been a challenge. I seem to have a leaning towards making such films.

Could you explain your fascination for Veerappan?

I will not call it a fascination. It is a curiosity for the truth. It is also because I was closely associated with one of his kidnappings cases. When Veerappan kidnapped Dr Rajumar, I was one of the first people to go into the forest. Nagappa, who was abducted with Dr Raj, is a close associate.

I describe this film as put together from an investigative journalist’s point of view. We will not be taking sides, nor will we pass judgement. We are not in a hurry to complete it, as we want the best visuals and content for a global audience.

Are you working on anything else?

Yes, I am also working on LTTE, which tells the story of Prabhakaran. I worked on this script for almost 25 years, but have stalled it for the moment. LTTE will be a 100-hour story. This will be released on an OTT platform and covers the Rajiv Gandhi assassination.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1sernq/article32880330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201003-WA0023,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/amr-rameshs-veerappan-hunger-for-killing-takes-off/article32880334.ece

132,2020/10/17,Deepa Mehta’s ‘Funny Boy’ to release December 10 on Netflix,"An adaptation of author Shyam Selvadurai’s 1994 novel of the same name, the movie is set in Sri Lanka during the 1970s and 1980s

Critically-acclaimed director Deepa Mehta’s next feature “Funny Boy” has been acquired by Hollywood filmmaker Ava DuVernay’s ARRAY Releasing.

An adaptation of author Shyam Selvadurai’s 1994 novel of the same name, the movie will be released theatrically in select cities and also debut on streamer Netflix on December 10, reported Deadline.

Set in Sri Lanka during the 1970s and 1980s, the film explores the sexual awakening of its young protagonist Arjie (played by Arush Nand/Brandon Ingram) from a young boy, deemed funny by disapproving family, to a teenager enamoured by a male classmate.

As political tensions escalate to a boiling point between the minority Tamils and the majority Sinhalese, the young boy comes of age in a society and family that doesn’t embrace difference outside of societal norms.

The film chronicles Arjie’s struggle to find balance and self-love despite the absence of empathy and understanding.

Mehta, known for critically-lauded trilogy “Earth”, “Fire” and “Water”, called “Funny Boy” a film about the “power of love“.

“In many ways, ’Funny Boy’ reflects the times of divisiveness we are living in today, where the call for a just society, a call for humanity is finally being heard.

“Having ARRAY Releasing by our side feels like ’Funny Boy’ has found not only a safe home during these tumultuous times but also a home that shimmers with hope for all who ARRAY welcomes in,” the filmmaker added.

In a joint statement, DuVernay and ARRAY President Tilane Jones hailed “Funny Boy” as a “cinematic gem“.

“Deepa Mehta’s ’Funny Boy’ builds upon the iconic filmmaker’s provocative canon of work as a film that is beautiful to the eye and emotional for the heart,” they said.

“Her singular vision for adapting this best-selling novel invites film lovers to delve deep into themes of identity, acceptance and family, while she shares the majesty and turmoil of Sri Lanka during this particular time in history,” they added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pj9dj0/article32880265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22WKPhotobyBenPruchnieGettyImagesjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/deepa-mehtas-funny-boy-to-release-december-10-on-netflix/article32880266.ece
133,2020/10/17,Raghava Lawrence: ‘Laxmmi Bomb’ has social messaging about transgender community,"The remake of the 2011 Tamil horror-comedy features Akshay Kumar as a transgender person, and also stars Kiara Advani in a pivotal role

Director Raghava Lawrence says the decision to name the Hindi remake of the Tamil film “Kanchana” as “Laxmmi Bomb” was a collective creative call to appeal to a wider audience and be more in sync with the movie.

The remake of the 2011 Tamil horror comedy features Akshay Kumar as a transgender person. It also stars actor Kiara Advani in a pivotal role.

Lawrence said the title, “Laxmmi Bomb”, felt more organic to the overall theme and messaging of the film.

“Our Tamil film was named after the main lead character Kanchana. Kanchana means ‘gold’ which is a form of Lakshmi. Earlier I considered going the same way for the Hindi remake but we collectively decided that the name must appeal to the Hindi audience as well and what better than Laxmmi.”

“By god’s grace, it was turning out to be a cracker of a film, so we named it ‘Laxmmi Bomb’ Like a dhamaka of Laxmmi Bomb cannot be missed, the transgender lead character is powerful and radiant. Hence the name fits perfectly,” the director said in a statement.

Lawrence stressed that “Laxmmi Bomb” infuses social messaging about the transgender community with horror and comedy, and he is thrilled to have Kumar fronting the film.

“After ‘Kanchana’ released in Tamil, the movie received huge appreciation from transgenders . They directly came to my home and blessed me.”

“So, in Hindi when Akshay sir is playing the role, I believe that the message will reach an even wider audience. My special thanks to Akshay sir for accepting and playing this role,” he added.

“Laxmmi Bomb”, produced by Kumar’s Cape of Good Films, Fox Star Studios, and Tusshar Kapoor, also features Ashwini Kalsekar, Sharad Kelkar, Manu Rishi and Ayesha Raza.

Lawrence said the idea to make “Kanchana” formed when a few transgenders approached a trust run by him. When he heard their story, he thought of chronicling it for the big screen.

“I wanted to tell their story to everyone, first through the character of ‘Kanchana’ and now with Laxmmi in this movie. After watching the film audiences will know what I am talking about,” the filmmaker said.

“Laxmmi Bomb” will release on Disney Plus Hotstar on November 9.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bvz4ij/article32879394.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/lax,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/raghava-lawrence-laxmmi-bomb-has-social-messaging-about-transgender-community/article32879395.ece

137,2020/10/17,HC stays requirement to obtain fitment certificates from manufacturers of reflective stickers,"Transport Secretary had made them mandatory for issuing Fitness Certificate to motor vehicles

The Madras High Court has stayed the operation of a communication by the Transport Secretary to all Regional Transport Officers (RTOs) on August 3 instructing them to insist upon production of fitment certificate from authorised private manufacturers of reflectors, reflective stickers and rear marking plates before issuing Fitness Certificates (FC) to motor vehicles.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh granted the interim stay on a writ petition filed by Tamil Nadu Lorry Owners Federation. The counsel for the federation S. Govindraman contended that the requirement to obtain fitment certificates from select private companies would cause hardship to motor vehicle owners. He also said such a procedure had no legal sanction at all.

Initially, the Transport Secretary had sent a communication to all RTOs in the State on July 23 saying that India had recorded largest number of fatalities in road accidents in the world and the same was increasing at an alarming level every year. Hence, it had been made mandatory for all public service vehicles to be fitted with reflectors on sides and rear.

Further, it had been made compulsory that only reflectors and reflective tapes conforming highest standards must be fitted on the vehicles. He stated that the government had identified two manufacturers who make reflectors in accordance with those standards and authorised them to affix the reflectors on vehicles that had to obtain Fitness Certificate every year.

In the subsequent communication on August 3, the Secretary told the RTOs that they must insist upon motor vehicle owners to produce fitment certificates from the authorised manufacturers of reflectors. Further, the RTOs should ascertain the genuineness of such fitment certificates by using security features such as hologram and scanning the QR code, he instructed.

Challenging such a stipulation, the petitioner association claimed that neither the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 nor the statutory rules framed under it contemplate any such procedure of obtaining fitment certificates from private companies. It said that the stipulation imposed by the Transport Secretary Tenkasi S. Jawahar was peculiar and arbitrary.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-stays-requirement-to-obtain-fitment-certificates-from-manufacturers-of-reflective-stickers/article32877531.ece

140,2020/10/17,Writer of Muralitharan biopic: ‘There are shades of grey in 800',"The writers of the Vijay Sethupathi-starrer were keen not to make it a one-dimensional tale of a flawless superhero

The writers of 800 wanted to tell the story of a cricketing legend, but were keen not to make it a one-dimensional tale of a flawless superhero. They sought to bring in nuance, “the shades of grey” in Mr. Muralitharan’s career and life, according to Shehan Karunatilaka, an acclaimed Sri Lankan novelist who co-wrote the story with director M.S. Sripathy.

“Murali”, Sri Lankan commentators have often observed, has been a controversial figure for more reasons than one.

“Most cricketing fans in the subcontinent are behind him, but, in the broader cricketing world, say, among Australian or English fans of the game, you will find a percentage of people who say Murali is a genius, and another that calls his bowling action illegitimate,” Mr. Karunatilaka added.

Off-field, Mr. Muralitharan was a lone Tamil in a team dominated by boys from “very Sinhala, nationalist schools”, but somehow had his teammates rallying around him in the dressing room. “He didn’t play up his Tamil identity, so there is this question of how Tamil he was allowed to be, in that context. There are many layers to his story and for any actor, playing such a character will be fascinating,” he said.

Meanwhile, Malaya Tamil leader and Parliamentarian Mano Ganesan said in a Facebook post that Mr. Muralitharan rose from the school team to the national team, and, later, went on to become an acclaimed cricketer in the international arena.

However, he said: “In cricket, he [Muralitharan] is a hero, but politically a zero,” referring to a meeting that the star cricketer participated in, ahead of Sri Lanka’s August general elections, sharing the dais with a hard-line Sinhala nationalist politician Wimal Weerawansa, a long-time ally of the Rajapaksas and a Cabinet Minister in their current administration.

However, Mr. Ganesan said: “As long as the film doesn’t justify his [Muralitharan's] irresponsible politics, let it come and go. Let the life struggles of a Tamil, of a Sri Lankan, be featured in a film,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/69n7nh/article32879350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vijayjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/writer-of-muralitharan-biopic-there-are-shades-of-grey-in-800/article32877474.ece
141,2020/10/17,‘Digital divide poses major challenge to online classes’,"‘Only 2.51% of govt. school students have access to a computer or laptop’

Only about half of the student population of government schools in the Union Territory have access to gadgets and internet connection.

This is making it difficult for the Education Department to depend on one online platform to have virtual classes during the COVID-19 lockdown.

A ‘Device Availability Survey’ conducted by the department during distribution of food security allowance revealed that only 2.51% of government school students had access to a computer or a laptop in the Union Territory.

Students having tablets are confined to 0.89% and smartphone with internet connection to 47.98% while 10.42% of the students have access to a smartphone without internet connection.

Even in the case of access to television sets, the numbers are not too comfortable, given the Union Territory’s status of a higher per capita income place.

While 67.41% of the students have access to televisions sets with cable connection, only 20.83% of students have access to television sets with DTH connection.

When it comes to button phone, 52.13% of the students have access to the gadget. Students having access to radio is only 10.81%, the survey said.

Director of School Education P.T. Rudra Goud told The Hindu that the digital divide posed a major challenge in conducting online classes.

“We will have to plan a multi-mode strategy where people can access study materials through television. We have already directed the students to watch Kalvi channel of Tamil Nadu. Since the syllabus is the same, the students can benefit from watching the channel,” he said.

The department would be also sharing recorded videos of subjects explained by the teachers, he said. “Blended modes of transmission will be considered to ensure maximum reach,” he said.

On the partial resumption of educational activities in high schools, Mr. Goud said there was good response from the students. “Only one student got infected with coronavirus and the transmission was from outside school,” he said.

The department also issued show cause notice to Kavi Bharathi School at K.T. Kuppam near Madagadipet for not following guidelines. “Inspection by our team revealed that the school authorities were not following social distancing norms. The team will be again visiting the school on Friday,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ihz76m/article32877459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THGOVTSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/digital-divide-poses-major-challenge-to-online-classes/article32877460.ece

No changes in manpower need to be made and treatment protocols should to be delivered with due clearance from ICMR experts, she said.

He was speaking at a virtual conference, ‘Indo Czech Executive Round Table: Doing Business with Tamil Nadu’, organised by The Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI).

Mr. Sampath said pharma is another sector with such potential. “With changing global pharmaceutical supply and manufacturing chains, Czech Republic can count on Tamil Nadu as an alternate, credible source of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (APIs),” he added.

The Minister also highlighted the State’s strengths in automobile and auto components, electronics, information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services.

Martina Tauberova, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade for EU Affairs and Foreign Trade, Government of the Czech Republic, said India is the most important partner in Asia and there is a long history of collaboration. She also noted that Tamil Nadu and Czech Republic share many strengths, including in traditional industries like engineering, automotive sector, textile and agriculture. “Based on this synergy, we can certainly launch new initiatives and new ways of our enhanced co-operation,” she said.

In his keynote address, Milan Hovorka, Ambassador of the Czech Republic in India, said he is hopeful that Tamil Nadu will return to its pre-COVID-19 status soon due to its aggressive testing strategy.

Ar Rm Arun, President, SICCI and Honorary Consul of the Czech Republic in Chennai, said that Tamil Nadu is planning to attract investments worth $10 bn in the next 5-10 years, and business opportunities include automotive, advanced engineering, energy, electronics, IT, healthcare, textiles and beverages, and defence.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-can-be-a-key-destination-for-czech-republics-defence-manufacturing/article32877424.ece
144,2020/10/17,Muttiah Muralitharan: 'I did not support the killing of innocent civilians',"Comment comes in the wake of backlash against the biopic '800'

Actor Vijay Sethupathi has, in the last few days, faced severe criticism on social media for having agreed to play the lead role in 800, the biopic of Sri Lankan Tamil cricketing icon, Muttiah Muralitharan.

Sections of Tamil society and political parties urged the actor not to be a part of the film that celebrates the life and achievements of the cricketer.

Mr. Muralitharan’s comment in 2019 that “2009 was the happiest day in my life”, has been cited as proof of his support to the final war against the Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, in 2009, in which thousands of innocent civilians were killed, and his support to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s regime, which continues to face serious allegations of war crimes.

Responding to criticism, the Sri Lankan cricketing legend on Friday said his comments about the end of war in 2009 had been taken out of context.

In a statement in Tamil, Mr. Muralitharan said, “In a country that has been at war, we don’t know what will happen and when. A friend who used to play with me in school would not be alive the next day. Those who leave the house would have to return home for us to be sure of their safety. From an ordinary citizen’s point of view, the end of war made me feel safe, and, in the last ten years, there haven’t been any deaths on either sides… I had this in my heart when I said that 2009 was a happy day in my life. I did not support the killings of innocent people and I would not do it,” he said.

Mr. Muralitharan also denied reports that he did not know Tamil and addressed the accusation against him that he had said that Tamils have an inferiority complex.

“It is natural to have an inferiority complex when you are a minority amid the Sinhala people. My parents and I had it. However, my interest in cricket pushed me to join the cricket team in my school and my talent made it impossible for others to ignore me. Which is why I said that our inferiority complex should be thrown away and we should trust our talent,” he said.

Mr. Muralitharan said that he considers all ethnicities as one and the same.

“As a hill country Tamil, I have helped more Eelam Tamils than the hill country Tamils. I don’t like to talk about it, but I am being forced to do it. When I was the Ambassador for the United Nations World Food Program in 2002, the Eelam Tamils will remember, how I took the program to the schools in the regions controlled by the LTTE, and, then, later, to regions affected by the Tsunami,” he said.

The off-spinner also said that through his charity, the Foundation Of Goodness, he was involved in several initiatives that provided education to women or ensured medical services reached the Eelam Tamils. “We are also conducting a cricket competition called ‘Murali Harmony Cup’ in the north and south. Just because I made a name in the Sri Lankan cricket team, I have been unfairly portrayed. Had I been born in India, I would have tried to get into the Indian cricket team. Is it my fault that I was born a Sri Lankan Tamil?” he asked.

He said he was saddened by those who are portraying him as someone against the Tamils.

“Though I know that no amount of clarification will pacify those who oppose me, I am providing this clarification for the neutrals and the people who read one-sided news about me,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/n4f867/article32879349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/collagejpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/muttiah-muralitharan-i-did-not-support-the-killing-of-innocent-civilians/article32877421.ece
145,2020/10/17,Drop in HIV prevalence in antenatal women,"Monitoring in 11 districts that have a higher prevalence will be stepped up

The overall prevalence of HIV/AIDS among antenatal women has dropped from 0.27% to 0.18% in Tamil Nadu, but eleven districts have recorded a higher prevalence than the State’s average. With Tamil Nadu having “sufficient” health infrastructure for testing and treatment, officials say they are looking to intensify measures to raise awareness for reducing HIV/AIDS prevalence in the districts.

According to the recently released 16th round of HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS), 2019, among pregnant women, the top five districts with high HIV prevalence are: Vellore (0.75%), Namakkal (0.75%), Krishnagiri (0.50%), Sivaganga (0.38%) and Coimbatore (0.38%). Tiruppur, Pudukottai, Madurai, Karur and Erode had a prevalence of 0.25% each. They were the other major districts with HIV prevalence higher than the State average.

Tirunelveli recorded an HIV prevalence of 0.17%, while Virudhunagar, Villupuram, Tiruvannamalai, Tiruchi, Tiruvallur, Salem, Kancheepuram and Cuddalore recorded 0.13%. The remaining 12 districts had zero HIV prevalence among antenatal care (ANC) clinic attendees.

HIV prevalence among ANC clinic attendees showed a declining trend at the State level and in most districts, including Chennai. A rising trend in the recent past was noted in Vellore and Namakkal. The findings from the round corroborated with previous rounds, showing a low and declining trend at the State level. A sustained declining trend among antenatal women, nationally and at the State level, is a positive indicator of the successful response of the National AIDS Control Programme. However, the district-level fluctuating trends are a continuing challenge, according to HSS.

What led to the drop in HIV prevalence among antenatal women? Deepak Jacob, project director of the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society, said, “Antenatal women are mandatorily tested for HIV/AIDS. We are testing 12.5 lakh women a year at the level of primary health centres, taluk hospitals and government medical college hospitals. This is 130% of our target. We link those who test positive to the Anti-Retroviral Therapy centres, numbering 55.”

Through the campaign for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, prophylactic treatment is provided and the newborn of an HIV-positive mother is put on a drug regimen. At the end of three months, the baby is screened for HIV/AIDS, he added.

“The State has a robust testing network through Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC). We have 807 standalone ICTCs and 2,200 facility ICTCs. If a person tests positive for HIV at a facility ICTC, he/she is referred to a standalone centre. Similarly, we have inked memoranda of understanding with 177 private medical facilities where testing is being conducted,” he said.

There are 16 mobile ICTCs, and there are plans to increase this to 27. A proposal for the same has been sent to the National AIDS Control Organisation. “These units will be deployed at the 27 district AIDS prevention and control units that monitor testing and linkages of ‘People Living with HIV/AIDS to ART centres’. These units function in districts with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS,” he said.

He said that they were planning to intensify IEC campaigns in the 11 districts with higher HIV prevalence, since the State already had sufficient health infrastructure. Amid the pandemic, these efforts are likely to be re-activated during December or January.

Officials said some of the 11 districts were border districts, where migrant/floating population was one of the challenges. Vellore has a migrant/floating population, while the Krishnagiri-Namakkal belt has a trucker population. It was difficult to keep track of the migrant population, they said.

The project director recalled that TANSACS had taken up a special campaign last year, during which a counsellor and lab technician visited the houses of mothers who did not come to the hospitals, with their newborns, for testing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3nzvvt/article32877811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-aids-pexels,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/drop-in-hiv-prevalence-in-antenatal-women/article32877318.ece
146,2020/10/17,State NEET topper is from Tiruppur,"Mohanaprabha Ravichandran, G. Swetha score 705, 701

Tiruppur boy R. Srijan has topped the NEET rank list in Tamil Nadu with a score of 710 out of 720.

“I consider this a huge achievement,” said the all-India eighth rank holder and the national topper in the OBC category.

Hailing from Vellakovil in Tiruppur, he had enrolled at the Green Park coaching centre in Namakkal.

Mr. Srijan said this was his second attempt and his parents were of great support to him. “I scored 385 marks during the first attempt after which I joined the coaching centre and trained for a year. I would like to join Jipmer Institute in Puducherry and specialise in cardiology,” he said.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, he prepared for 10-12 hours a day and the coaching centre arranged various motivational sessions through online to keep them motivated. He added that he went through the NCERT prescribed syllabus thoroughly while preparing for the examinations.

Mohanaprabha Ravichandran, who scored 705 out of 720 marks, said she is elated that she could score such high marks in her first attempt. The student is a native of Namakkal. Talking to presspersons, Ms. Mohanaprabha said that she underwent a three-month crash course at Green Park coaching centre.

She said that she would like to join AIIMS and later specialise in neurology.

G. Swetha of Velammal Vidyalaya, Mel Ayanampakkam campus, has scored 701 marks (99.9951717). She has been placed 62 in the all-India rank list.

Ms. Swetha said she worked 8-10 hours daily towards achieving her goal. “I started preparing from Class XI. I did not do anything more than what the school taught me,” she said.

She said she prepared for Biology/Zoology using the NCERT book. “For Physics, we need to work extra sums and for Chemistry too, we need both NCERT and extra sums,” she added.

She has scored 99.9712497 in Physics; 99.9135297 in Chemistry; and 99.9819305 in Biology (Botany & Zoology).

Her father Ganesh Kumar is a self-employed engineer and her mother, Kalai Selvi, is a gynaecologist with Kamakshi Memorial Hospital.

“It is what I always wanted to do,” said Ms. Swetha. She has not yet decided yet about the college she would like to study.

147,2020/10/17,"Government school student from Theni clears NEET, scores 664 marks","There is nothing that government school students can’t do, says Jeevithkumar

Jeevithkumar, a student of the Government Model Higher Secondary School at Silvarpatti, Periyakulam, in Theni district, is among those who have cleared the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) this year.

In his first attempt last year, he scored only 193 marks. But he did not give up. “As a government school student, I wanted to prove that nothing is impossible,” said the boy who scored 664 marks this year.

His father K. Narayanamoorthy is a cowherd at Vadipatti and his mother is a worker under the MGNREGA. “Jeevith was the first in our family to score high marks in Class 10 and 12. We are very happy with how well he has done and it feels like he has already become a doctor,” said Mr. Narayanamoorthy.

Jeevith’s school played a major role in ensuring that he was able to enrol in year-long coaching classes. “When he expressed interest in wanting to attempt the NEET again, we managed to mobilise funds from teachers and donors. He was always a promising student and one of our toppers,” said A. Mohan, the school headmaster. He had scored 548 out of 600 marks in Class 12 and was the district topper.

While Jeevith spent over 10 months at a coaching centre, the COVID-19 lockdown meant that he had to return home. Mr. Mohan said that to ensure he had a good place to prepare, he was helped with an accommodation by one of his teachers. “I studied for over two months in a room provided by my teacher as the date for the exam got nearer,” Jeevith said. His teacher ensured that he was provided meals and had a space where he could concentrate and study.

“There is nothing that government school students can’t do and this kept me motivated to prepare well. The ten months of coaching also helped me a lot. I feel that what I was taught there and the regular tests aided my preparation,” said Jeevith, who hopes to pursue MBBS at the Madras Medical College.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/government-school-student-from-theni-clears-neet-scores-664-marks/article32877272.ece
148,2020/10/17,"Ahead of polls, MNM keen on a third front","However, option of alliances not ruled out; party leaders meet with Kamal

Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) will prioritise leading the third front, but will remain open for an alliance in the upcoming Assembly election in 2021, party sources told The Hindu, after members of its central governing body and executive council met in the presence of party founder Kamal Haasan on Friday.

The party also decided that it will contest the Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha byelection only if it is held along with the Assembly election next year.

A statement from the party said that seven committees had been formed to identify candidates, train them, create the party’s election manifesto, organise the party’s propaganda and look into other aspects related to preparations for the election.

Main takeaway

Speaking to The Hindu, party vice-president R. Mahendran said: “If we can contest in 38 Parliamentary seats, we can do it in 234 Assembly seats as well.”

“The main takeaway was that we should be ready to go alone. The wish of the party leaders and the party cadre is that we should form a third front. As far as decisions on alliances go, the party president has been given unanimous authority,” he said.

Dr. Mahendran said ‘constituency custodians’ had been asked to complete the process of forming booth committees, increase the party’s visibility and recommend candidates to the committee, to complete the process by January.

A. Arunachalam, general secretary, MNM, said several parties were already speaking to the party about a possible alliance. Sources at the meeting acknowledged that any discussion about electoral alliances with Dravidian parties would go against Mr. Haasan’s conviction that MNM is an alternative to the two Dravidian parties. They, however, confessed that the possibility of forming a third front, may, in practical terms, depend on whether Mr. Rajinikanth decides to contest the Assembly elections in 2021.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ahead-of-polls-mnm-keen-on-a-third-front/article32877268.ece
149,2020/10/17,"AIADMK enters 49th year, faces twin challenges","The ruling party has been going through a testing phase since the 2016 election

The AIADMK, which steps into its 49th year on Saturday, is facing the twin challenges of retaining power and maintaining its status of being a principal political party of the State in the Assembly election due in April-May 2021.

After securing over 40% vote share in the 2016 Assembly election for the second time, the ruling party has been going through a testing phase in elections.

In the byelections to 25 Assembly constituencies after former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, it could win only in 11.

Besides, the BJP, an ally of the AIADMK, is going ahead with its plan to expand its base in a perceptible manner. Two other allies, the PMK and the DMDK, are showing restlessness at times through their public statements.

Right alliance

Senior AIADMK leaders acknowledge that winning the Assembly election is going to be a major challenge for the party.

“We will have to stitch up the right alliance,” said J.C.D. Prabhakar, one of the organisation secretaries and a member of the 11-member steering committee.

Hailing the State government for the way it has been tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, he, however, pointed out that the party had to “take measures that are convincing” to the religious minorities.

S. Semmalai, another organisation secretary and one of the party’s nominees in the 1977 Assembly election, said the absence of a “strong leader” would not pose any problem to the AIADMK, as both Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam had been “groomed well” by Jayalalithaa.

“Among the people of the State, there is neither anti-incumbency nor willingness to back the DMK,” he said.

Leaders’ statement

In a joint statement on the eve of the party’s foundation day, Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam called upon the members to make a resolve to help the party stay in power during its golden jubilee year too.

V. Raghupathy, head of the department of Political Science and Public Administration at the Gandhigram Rural University, said the AIADMK, which is under pressure, has to disseminate the message among the people that it will never deviate from its commitment towards the core features of Tamil Nadu’s politics, including social justice, the two-language formula and welfarism.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wlme79/article31677439.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26MAYTH--AIADMK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-enters-49th-year-faces-twin-challenges/article32877258.ece
150,2020/10/17,HC dismisses Theni MP’s plea,"The Madras High Court on Friday dismissed an application preferred by Theni MP P. Raveendranath Kumar to reject an election petition filed by a voter challenging his electoral victory on the ground of having allegedly indulged in corrupt practices.

Justice M.S. Ramesh also refused to entertain another application made by the MP to strike off certain contentious paragraphs from the complaint.

Justice Ramesh agreed with advocate V. Arun, representing the petitioner, that the MP should face a full-fledged trial.

P. Milany, a 38-year-old mechanical engineer from Palanichettipatti in Theni taluk, had filed the election petition under Section 81 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

He accused the MP of having indulged in electoral malpractices to win last year and alleged that the legislator’s father, O. Panneerselvam, Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, had also misused government machinery to get his son elected from the constituency.

However, Mr. Kumar denied all allegations levelled against him as well as his father and urged the court to reject the election petition since it was ‘bereft of material facts and particulars’. He claimed the case had been filed on presumptions.

Filing a counter to the application for rejecting the election petition, Mr. Milany said his plea was not bereft of material and particulars since he had mentioned the date, time and place where he had witnessed the distribution of clothes and money to voters.

The petitioner was confident of proving all his allegations if his counsel was allowed to examine and cross-examine the witnesses during the trial proceedings. He also claimed that the MP was just dragging out the proceedings by filing applications.

Mr. Milany said the Election Commission of India itself ought to have rescinded the election notification for Theni constituency, as it had done in the case of Vellore, since there were equally serious charges of voters having been bribed in Theni too.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-dismisses-theni-mps-plea/article32877250.ece
151,2020/10/17,Top rankers opt for circuit branches,"62.8% of seats allotted were for Computer Science and Engineering, ECE & EEE

Circuit branches continue to attract engineering aspirants. In the first round of allotment under the single window counselling of the Tamil Nadu Engineering Admission 2020, the results of which were released on Friday, 62.8% of the seats allotted were for Computer Science and Engineering, ECE, EEE, and Information Technology.

Of the 12,500 students who had been called for counselling, the cut-off for which ended at 175 marks, 7,510 seats had been allotted. The College of Engineering, Guindy, led the table with 928 seats being filled, whereas 294 colleges did not fill even one seat.

While Anna University and some top-rung colleges such as SSN, PSG and Thiagarajar College of Engineering have steered clear of new courses, others have launched niche courses in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Machine Learning. These courses have had good response. Aspirants have been attracted to two new courses — Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning — in which 2.2% of the seats have been allotted.

Colleges that have started the new courses are upbeat. A. Ramesh, principal of the Chennai Institute of Technology, said it had tied up with IT companies to train students. “We have recruited faculty who have completed Ph.D in AI and we have tied up with a few companies that will provide us adjunct faculty to provide online classes. The students will have practical exposure, and that is possible only if they have industrial experience,” he said.

R.M. Kishore of RMK Group of Institutions, which has also started the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science programme, said it had tied up with three IT companies: TCS, Cognizant and Virtusa. Since these companies are expected to recruit students from the college in the next three-four years, they have provided the syllabus for the programme, he said.

Though the admission pattern is the same as last year, Jayaprakash Gandhi, an independent education consultant, said almost 2,500 candidates did not pay the initial deposit. Among the self-financing colleges, SSN had done better than PSG and Thiagarajar College, he said. Colleges that filled only a small number of seats they had surrendered to the government said they expected to do well.

“Unlike last year, the number of those opting for engineering is higher this year. Students were willing to pay a high capitation fee in some colleges in the Coimbatore belt,” said a professor of a self-financing college in the city. “We expect the admission to pick up in the next two rounds,” he said.

Senior professors in top-rung institutions, including Anna University, are worried by the delay in counselling for medicine.

Almost all top-rung colleges will see seats lapse once medical counselling begins. Professors anticipate 500 seats falling vacant at Anna University alone.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hvm84f/article32877238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17REV-TNEAcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/top-rankers-opt-for-circuit-branches/article32877239.ece

155,2020/10/17,ED seizes DMK MP’s assets worth ₹8.6 crore,"Ponmudi’s son Gautham Sigamani made investments abroad ‘without RBI permission’

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has seized assets worth ₹8.6 crore, held by Kallakurichi DMK MP Gautham Sigamani, equivalent to the value of “illegally” acquired foreign security and alleged non-repatriated foreign exchange earned abroad till date. Mr. Sigamani is the son of former Minister and DMK leader K. Ponmudi.

The ED said it took up the probe based on information that Mr. Sigamani had illegally acquired foreign security without the Reserve Bank of India’s approval, in violation of Section 4 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).

The investigation “revealed that in March 2008, Gautham Sigamani, being a person resident in India, made overseas investment of $1,00,000 (₹41,57,225) in acquiring 2,45,000 shares of PT Excel Megindo, Jakarta, and $55,000 (₹22,86,924) in Universal Business Ventures, UAE”. The agency alleged that the investments were made without the RBI’s permission.

Profits kept abroad

It has also been alleged that Mr. Sigamani had failed to repatriate profits of over ₹7.05 crore earned by him from Universal Business Ventures from 2008-09 to 2012-13. He allegedly held them abroad till date in contravention of Section 4, read with Section 8, of the FEMA.

According to the ED, Mr. Sigamani did not repatriate the balance amount lying in the bank account of Universal Business Ventures to the tune of 6,04,783 dirhams, equivalent to over ₹90 lakh, as on December 31, 2012.

Therefore, under Section 37A of the FEMA, the ED has seized immovable properties in the form of agricultural lands, commercial and residential buildings in Tamil Nadu and movable properties in the form of bank balances and shares.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ld62u4/article32877168.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17GAUTHAMSIGAMANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ed-seizes-dmk-mps-assets-worth-86-crore/article32877169.ece

Former Chief Secretary P. Rama Mohana Rao on Friday alleged that there was a conspiracy immediately after the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in December 2016 and he had become a victim of it.

However, he did not elaborate on the nature of the conspiracy, saying that he would reveal it at the appropriate time.

“There is no doubt that there was a conspiracy immediately after Amma’s (Jayalalithaa) death. I became the victim of the conspiracy by facing Income Tax raids. I am a clean person. I will expose the conspiracy and conspirators at the right time,” Mr. Rao said while choosing not to blame any particular party or individual.

Active politics

“I am still wondering why I alone was targeted after Jayalalithaa’s death. I suspect that it was an attempt to divert the attention of the people to cover up others.

157,2020/10/17,Leander Paes: ‘Andre Agassi is my all-time favourite opponent’,"The Indian tennis legend on professional sport being played in times of the COVID-19 pandemic and more

One of the most decorated sportsmen in the country, and greatest doubles players in the history of tennis, Leander Paes has seen it all during his inspirational career that goes back over three decades.

But in the wake of the pandemic that put a halt to all sporting tournaments until recently, Paes’ last season as a professional tennis player (he had earlier announced that 2020 would be his farewell year) has been cut short. It remains to be seen though, if he will extend his career for a bit longer to give it a fitting finale. For now, the multiple Grand Slam winner is just happy to welcome tennis back into everyone’s lives again.

Recently, the tennis legend found time to talk to us before participating in the virtual chat show Chai with Raja.

“Sport brings communities and people from across the country and the globe together. Tennis, as a sport, has a natural social distancing — so it’s great to witness it back in action. I still feel that professional sports like boxing and wrestling that involve close proximity are still a way away from coming back.”

“Having said that, it’s been fantastic to see how the basketball and football leagues have been coordinated. For example, the La Liga, the Premier League or the NBA; these organisations have done a terrific job of finishing the games last season and starting again this season. They have done that by ensuring all the players stay in a bubble and follow all the precautions,” Paes adds.

He admits though that while sport is a great vehicle to bring happiness to people, it does feel a bit weird to play with empty stands as an athlete. “Even while watching on television, sport can really inspire after coming back into our daily lives. But pro-players have to be cautious with travelling, airplanes, staying in hotels and the like, in the recent future.”

Calling Andre Agassi his all-time favourite opponent on court, Paes says that their styles of play always matched up against each other over decades. “He is a baseliner with some of the best return of serves and passing shots in the history of the game, while I’m a classic serve-and-volley player. The match up was fantastic. Besides that, Andre’s father was an Olympic boxer while my father was an Olympic champion in field hockey. So we have always recognised the pedigree we come from.”

He adds, “He’s still one of my closest friends, and he even gave me a great back-handed compliment in his autobiography Open. Andre is just one of those really big-hearted athletes who totally epitomises what a sporting champion should be.”

158,2020/10/17,Owners can now upload data on Dharani portal,"Government launches online facility for enlistment of non-agricultural properties for Dharani

The State government has further eased the modalities for updating the non-agricultural properties for Dharani portal.

Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar in a statement on Saturday night said to further supplement the effort, two new channels have been created for property owners in GHMC and other municipalities to furnish information. Property owners can access the portal and update details on their own using the URL www.npb.telangana.gov.in or using the services of Mee Seva

This facility of enlisting properties at Mee Seva will be available free, service charges payable to Mee Seva will be borne by GHMC/municipality concerned.

Property owners will have to furnish the Aadhaar number (to protect property from fraudulent transactions), mobile number (to send alerts/ information to owners regarding their property), family member details as declared by owner (for securing property rights of family members), photograph of owner (for printing on the maroon NPB), extent of plot/built-up area.

The information is required to be furnished by property owner on voluntary basis. However, properties of such owners would not be migrated to the new system, the release said.

Both the above channels are available with immediate effect for GHMC and municipalities. Those who have already enlisted through property through Mobile App need not enlist again using the above channels.

The modalities for registration of properties by NRIs, OCIs and foreign nationals will be issued separately.

It may be mentioned here that Dharani project has been conceptualised by Government of Telangana as a comprehensive system for safeguarding ownership and streamlining transactions related to immovable property in the State. A discretionless, transparent and hassle free system for instant registration and mutation of properties is being introduced. It will be based on Aadhaar enabled biometric verification of owner’s identity.

A digital database of agricultural properties has already been created and pattadar passbooks (green) have been issued. Now, a similar database is proposed to be created for non-agricultural properties for which maroon colour Non-Agriculture Immovable Property Passbooks (NPBs) will be issued.

The maroon passbooks will be printed with state-of-the-art security features. The data furnished by property owners will be stored in encrypted format on dedicated state government servers and will be used solely for the purpose of Dharani.

In this regard, requisite information is already being collected from property owners using a specially designed Mobile App. Over 24,400 officials have been deployed across the State to interact with property owners for collection of data. As on 17 October, more than 75.74 lakh properties have been enlisted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/iop49c/article32883567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18SOMESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/owners-can-now-upload-data-on-dharani-portal/article32883515.ece

161,2020/10/17,Tenant farmers in debt trap,"‘Tenant’ column removed from revenue records’

“The Government has no record of tenant farmers and no land owner has ever recognised a tenant farmer formally. In such a case, how can the government can extend financial assistance of Rytu Bandhu to people who have no right on land?” asked Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao during his address to Assembly on June 23, 2018. He also opined that this may lead to irrational demands from different sections in future.

After two and a half years, in October, the State witnessed heavy downpour for two days, creating chaos not only in the State capital but also in the districts.

In addition, he spent ₹30,000 for each acre of cotton and the total amount spent by him for five acres reached to ₹1.5 lakh and the total debt for this season alone was ₹2 lakh.

In this village there are more than 100 farmers and all of them have leased lands, ranging from one acre to 10 acres and cultivated cotton. Now all of them are in trouble of debt.

“Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao says that there are no tenant farmers at all in the State and there was no record at all. But who are cultivating these lands when landlords are staying in towns and Hyderabad? Who is filling our plate and offering food security in the absence of landlord not taking up cultivation?” asked Mr. G.

D. Ashok is a farmer from Meligiripet village of Sadashivapet mandal. He had leased about 10 acres by paying ₹10,000 per acre, and hoping to get a bumper harvest, invested another ₹2 lakh on cotton. But, his hopes were dashed as all his crops are in deep water after heavy rains in Telangana.

“There is nothing left. The cotton balls are completely damaged. Water is still there in the field and it is cloudy again. What should I do now?” asked Ashok.

In distress

Not only him, thousands of farmers in erstwhile Medak district are in serious distress and unable to think about tomorrow. The district is worst-hit after heavy rainfall for three days.

In Medak district, paddy was damaged in about 10,000 acres followed by cotton in 15,000 acres. In Siddipet district, paddy in 32,000 acres, cotton in 29,000 acres, redgram and vegetables in about 1,700 acres got damaged.

In Sangareddy district, the loss was put at cotton in 99,000 acres, paddy 9,000 acres, redgram 20,000 acres, sugarcane 6,000 acres and soya 3,000 acres. In several areas, crops were almost ready for harvest.

Major loss

Cotton was lost in a total of 1,43,000 acres followed by paddy damaged in a total of 41,000 acres.

Paddy yield will be around 25 quintals per acre and per quintal price is ₹1,850. This will put the total loss at ₹189.62 crore

Similarly in cotton, the average yield is being put at eight quintals per acre by agriculture officials and per quintal price is ₹5,600. So, the loss was estimated at ₹640.64 crore.

The Kashmir Valley’s most troubled and militancy-affected Pulwama district has earned a new distinction — that of being home to one of J&K’s National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) toppers, Basit Bilal Khan. The 18-year-old Khan scored 695 marks out of 720.

“My parents had shifted me from Pulwama three years ago to Srinagar. I was insulated from what was happening in my district, whether favourable or unfavourable. It did contribute to my success,” Mr. Khan told The Hindu.

On the Internet ban and slow connectivity in J&K, Mr. Khan said students in Kashmir need to find new ways and means to achieve their goals.

“If your goal is important to you, find ways rather than excuses. We are not having favourable conditions for many many years now. We should be prepared to face the tough conditions, as we may face more hardships,” he said.

Advisor to the Lieutenant-Governor, Farooq Khan, felicitated Mr. Khan for his “historic feat of securing 99.98 percentile in the NEET-2020 exam”.

170,2020/10/17,Over 50 lakh benefit from nutritious food scheme in Rajasthan,"It fulfils State government’s promise of “no one sleeps hungry”, says Gehlot

Over 50 lakh people have benefited from a new kitchen scheme, named after former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, launched in Rajasthan for providing nutritious food to the poor and needy twice a day at concessional rates. The State government plans to spend ₹95 crore during its first year.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who inaugurated the ambitious Indira Rasoi Yojana on August 20, said here on Saturday it would fulfil the State government’s promise of “no one sleeps hungry”. “Our aim is not just to feed the hungry and eradicate malnutrition... We wish to realise the World Food Day’s theme this year to grow, nourish and sustain together,” Mr. Gehlot said.

While the Chief Minister said the scheme had ensured supply of healthy and nutritious food during the pandemic, the Local Self-Government department released the distribution figures on Saturday. Since August 20, food has been distributed to 1.33 lakh persons per day in the urban local bodies benefiting 50.30 lakh persons across the State.

Though each plate is priced at ₹20, the State government provides a subsidy of ₹12 per meal, bringing down the price to ₹8 for the beneficiaries at 358 distribution centres.

Each plate serves 100 grams of pulses and vegetables each, 250 grams of chapati and pickles. A special app has been created for monitoring the food quality, while the local voluntary organisations have been roped in for establishing the centres near the places such as bus stands, railway stations and hospitals.

The previous BJP regime had also launched a subsidised meal scheme, Annapurna Rasoi Yojana, in December 2016, offering breakfast and lunch for ₹5 and ₹8 respectively on the lines of Tamil Nadu’s Amma Unavagam (mother’s canteen). The Congress government had scrapped it.

Unlike the Annapurna Yojana, arrangements have been made for seating of people and serving them food under the Indira Rasoi Yojana.

The Jammu Muslim Front (JMF) on Saturday backed the decision of the Kashmir-based political parties to unitedly fight for the restoration of the region’s special status under Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution.

“The JMF stands for the reinstatement of the rights of all residents of J&K people irrespective of any discrimination. The coming together of mainstream regional parties of J&K to fight a constitutional battle to restore the rights of the people of J&K, including Ladakh, is a welcome step”, a JMF spokesman said.

The JMF appealed to the People’s Alliance for the Guplar Declaration, headed by Dr. Farqooq Abdullah, “to increase its ambit and take every section of society in confidence so that in real sense it should be a people’s movement”.

At least six political parties, including the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in J&K have come together to fight for restoration of the pre-August 5 position.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jammu-muslim-front-backs-gupkar-declaration/article32881929.ece
173,2020/10/17,Tripura University drops curriculum chapter amid protests by tribal groups,"Tripura University has decided to drop a chapter from its curriculum meant for M.A. (Master of Arts) courses to respect the sentiment of the State’s indigenous communities. The chapter titled ‘Administration and Politics in Tripura’ mentions that a non-tribal Bengali king ruled the State 550 years ago.

Tribal groups, including the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Tripura (INPT), rubbished the claim and said that the State had always been ruled by tribal kings till it merged with India on October 15, 1949. They added that the indigenous population of the State had been reduced to a minority due to influx from East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.

Top leaders of the INPT called on Governor Ramesh Bais to lodge complaints over the controversy and sought his intervention. The Governor subsequently held a meeting with the Vice-Chancellor Tripura University Professor Ganga Prasad Prasain to settle the contentious issue.

INPT general secretary Jagadish Debbarma on Saturday stated that they have received information from the university over withdrawal of the “flawed chapter”.

Mr. Debbarma lauded Governor Ramesh Bais for his instant intercession.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tripura-university-drops-curriculum-chapter-amid-protests-by-tribal-groups/article32881841.ece
174,2020/10/17,Massive Ranchi rally demands release of Stan Swamy,"Opposition parties, civil society groups condemn NIA arrest of 83-year-old activist

All major non-BJP political parties and social activists on Saturday took to the streets in Ranchi, demanding the immediate release of Stan Swamy, the 83-year-old tribal rights activist, who was arrested last week by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with Bhima Koregaon case.

The march titled ‘Nyay March’ started from the Zilla School and culminated with a dharna in front of the Raj Bhawan.

“Mr. Swamy has been working for tribal rights for years now. His credential as an activist has never been in question. It is illegal to lodge him in jail for a crime which he has not committed,” said Prafulla Linda, Adivasi Adhikar Manch, a CPI (M)-affiliated organisation.

Mr. Swamy’s arrest was a part of the central government’s strategy to intensify loot of Jharkhand’s natural resources, alleged Sanjay Pandey, the district secretary of the Congress.

Activist Dayamani Barla said, “Father Stan Swamy had been fighting for protection of water, forest and land. Following his footsteps, hundreds of grassroot level workers and activists have been doing the same work in villages. Activists of different people’s movements are standing solidly behind Mr. Swamy.”

Political parties including the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, CPI and CPI (ML) and organisations such as Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha, Jan Mukti Sangharsh Vahini, Manaveey Ekta, National Domestic Workers Movement, Right to Food Campaign, Visthapan Virodhi Jan Vikas Andolan, and Singhbhum Adivasi Samaj, Sajha Kadam participated in the protest rally.

Mahua Manjhi of JMM condemned the arrest of Mr. Swamy, saying the NIA could have asked few questions related to case at his residence and there was no need to put him behind bars.

Through a memorandum addressed to Governor Draupadi Murmu, they demanded immediate release of Mr. Swamy and all political prisoners, closure of Bhima-Koregaon case withdrawal of false cases related to Delhi riot cases and repeal sections 124A (sedition) and 499 (criminal defamation) of the Indian Penal Code, Unlawful Activities (Preventions) Act (UAPA) and National Security Act (NSA).",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xgajgt/article32881758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STANSWAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/massive-ranchi-rally-demands-release-of-stan-swamy/article32881759.ece
175,2020/10/17,Yogi Adityanath launches ‘Mission Shakti’; vows ‘zero tolerance’ to crimes against women,"The campaign will continue for the next six months till Basant Navratri, the Chief Minister said

Facing flak over a string of rape incidents in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday launched ‘Mission Shakti’ campaign focusing on ensuring the safety and dignity of women and girls, with a stern warning that perpetrators of crimes against females will be dealt with an iron hand.

The Chief Minister said the campaign, whose start coincided with the commencement of the Navrati festival dedicated to Goddess Durga, is a tribute to the woman who died after being allegedly raped by two men in Balrampur and asserted that his government has “zero tolerance” towards crime against women and girls.

The 22-year-old Dalit woman died after being allegedly raped by two men, who were later arrested, in the district. The incident came close on the heels of the gangrape-murder of another Dalit woman in Hathras that had drawn intense outrage after alleged apathy of the administration.

“Those who cast an evil eye on the dignity and self-respect of women will find no place in the state. Perpetrators of such crimes are a blot on the society and the government will deal with them with an iron hand,” Mr. Adityanath asserted .

The campaign will continue for the next six months till Basant Navratri, the Chief Minister said.

“The first phase of ‘Mission Shakti’ will focus on spreading awareness towards ensuring the safety and dignity of women and girl-child. In the second phase, ‘Operation Shakti’ will target eve-teasers and put them on the path of punishment or reform. If such elements do not mend their ways, they will have to face social-boycott and their pictures will be displayed publicly,” Mr. Adityanath said.

The Chief Minister said that this year Ram Lila and Durga Puja pandals will also spread the message of ‘Mission Shakti’, which will have the involvement of 24 departments.

Various events are lined up during the campaign for which 100 role models among women will be identified in each district to help spread the message of women safety, self-respect and self-reliance.

Mr. Adityanath described women as a symbol of ‘Shakti’ and said gender equality and protection of the girl child should start from home itself.

“Women are venerable in our eternal tradition and Navratri signifies this. In these changing times, the new generation should become the carrier of our eternal tradition, which always professes the cause of women as the prime duty of mankind. ‘Mission Shakti’ is a reminder of our duty towards women and girls,” he said.

Terming female foeticide as a curse, the chief minister said, “Protection of the girl child and giving respect to women should start from home“.

Mr. Adityanath also expressed his strong views against child marriage, saying such practices should be publicly condemned.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/p97167/article32861821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YOGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yogi-adityanath-launches-mission-shakti-vows-zero-tolerance-to-crimes-against-women/article32881158.ece

West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday asked the State government to immediately release private security officer Balwinder Singh, whose turban came off during his arrest last week, and called it a case of human rights violation.

Mr. Dhankhar, who has had frequent run-ins with the administration over various issues since he assumed charge at the Raj Bhavan a year ago, said a delegation of ex-servicemen met him during the day and demanded that cases against Singh, a former Army jawan, be withdrawn.

“A delegation of Ex Servicemen Veterans called on me seeking immediate release, withdrawal of case #BalwinderSingh. Painful case of gross human right abuse and police highhandedness @WBPolice @HomeBengal,” he tweeted.

“Appeal @MamataOfficial to forthwith #Balvindrasingh and withdraw case,” he added.

The governor had met Mr. Singh’s wife Karamjit Kaur and their son three days back and urged Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to “undo the wrong committed“.

He had also met a Sikh delegation from Delhi on October 11 and said that instead of “justifying”, police should go for “rectification” of the act.

Controversy erupted after visuals of the police beating up Mr. Singh during the BJP’s ‘Nabanna March’ on October 8 went viral on social media.

A section of the netizens claimed the police had pulled off his turban during the scuffle.

The government, however, maintained his turban came off during the scuffle with the police.

177,2020/10/17,"Congress focus on Gwalior-Chambal, COVID-19 relief in Madhya Pradesh by-poll manifesto","Congress needs to win all 28 seats in upcoming by-elections to return to power single-handedly.

The Madhya Pradesh Congress on Saturday released a 52-point manifesto for the forthcoming by-election to 28 seats with a focus on the economic development of the Gwalior-Chambal region and COVID-19-related relief measures.

Releasing the manifesto before reporters here, former chief minister Kamal Nath said, “The election is about the future of Madhya Pradesh. Why will the public change its decision after our 15 months?” He added that the party made 974 promises ahead of the 2018 Vidhan Sabha election, of which it kept 574 in 11-and-a-half months.

Accusing Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan of using diversionary tactics, Mr. Nath said voters won’t “fall in his trap”. He added the public would vote to protect the future of Madhya Pradesh, which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was destroying. The Congress needs to win all the seats to return to power single-handedly, while the BJP requires nine seats to breach the simple majority mark and retain government.

In the manifesto, the Congress promised voters of resuming the ‘Jai Kisan Crop loan Waiver Scheme’, first announced ahead of the 2018 election, under which crop loans of up to ₹2 lakh had to be waived. Further, the party said it would not implement in the State “anti-farmers” laws enacted by the BJP government at the Centre, and would start afresh buying farm produce at support price.

For the Gwalior-Chambal region, the stronghold of turncoat Jyotiraditya Scindia where 16 seats are up for contest, the Congress has promised voters the formulation of a policy for land use in the interest of landless workers by converting Chambal ravines and barren lands into cultivable ones.

In addition, the party has made the promise of opening schools on the pattern of Sainik schools, and improving sporting facilities in the region in a bid to prepare the youth for defence forces.

The Congress also said it would invite new industries in the region and develop industrial corridors on both the sides of the Chambal expressway. Further, the party said it would review changes to labour laws made by the BJP government.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Congress promised voters a pension scheme for widows of the sole bread earners of a family who died of the disease, and a honorarium hike for anganwadi workers and ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activist). It also resolved to provide employment to local youths who lost jobs as commercial enterprises shut during the pandemic. The party also said it would help small businesses hit during the pandemic re-establish through interest-free loans of up to ₹50,000.

Describing the manifesto as a supplementary one, State BJP president V.D. Sharma pointed out that the Congress had not even kept the promises made earlier. “This time, they have made no promises, but only cursed the BJP and Mr. Chouhan because they fear us,” he said. Further, he accused the Congress of giving false loan-waiver certificates to farmers to claim it had kept the promise.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7b03i7/article32880884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CONGRESSMANIFESTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-bypoll-congress-manifesto-promises-help-to-covid-19-victims-kin/article32880885.ece

The Pakistan Rangers violated ceasefire overnight by resorting to unprovoked firing on forward posts and villages along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Saturday. The firing in the Pansar-Manyari area started around 9.15 p.m. Friday and continued through the night, forcing the residents to take shelter in the underground bunkers, the officials said.

They said BSF troops guarding the IB retaliated strongly. There was no report of any casualty on the Indian side, they said.

However, a barber shop suffered some damages, the officials said, adding the cross-border firing between the two sides stopped around 5.55 a.m.

A 48-year-old man from Manyari village received minor injures, the officials said.

According to official sources, 3,589 ceasefire violations by Pakistan were reported along the LoC and International Border till October 6 this year compared to a total of 3,168 in 2019.

The highest 427 ceasefire violations took place in September followed by 411 in March and 408 in August, the sources said, adding July recorded 398 ceasefire violations, June and April (387 each), May (382), February (366) and January (367).

180,2020/10/17,"Assam plans to shut govt.-run madrassas, Sanskrit tols in November","The Madrassa Education Board will be dissolved and all State-run madrassas will be converted into high schools and new admissions will be held for all as regular students.

All government-run madrassas and Sanskrit tols will be closed in Assam and a notification to this effect will be issued in November, Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday.

The Madrassa Education Board will be dissolved and all State-run madrassas will be converted into high schools and new admissions will be held for all as regular students, the Minister said addressing a press conference in Guwahati.

“The final year students will be allowed to pass out but henceforth all taking admission in these schools will have to study as regular students,” he said.

The Sanskrit tols (institutes) will be handed over to the Kumar Bhaskarvarma Sanskrit University and these will be converted into centres of learning and research where Indian culture, civilisation and nationalism will be studied, the minister said.

“This step has been taken by the government to ensure that students get regular education under the Secondary Education Board of Assam (SEBA),” he said.

The examinations of the madrassas and the tols are different with students not appearing for the matriculation examination conducted by the SEBA, he said.

“They are, however, given equivalency with those appearing in the Board examinations which is unfair on the regular students,” Mr. Sarma added.

Asked if the step was taken with an eye on the State elections, which is likely early next year, the Minister said: “How can this be an election issue when we are only closing the government-run madrassas and not the private ones.”

There are 610 government-run madrassas in Assam with the State spending ₹260 crore annually, Mr. Sarma said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nry91c/article32763578.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03-Nistula-AsG037QPQ224jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-plans-to-shut-govt-run-madrassas-sanskrit-tols-in-november/article32880305.ece
181,2020/10/17,‘Zero Rajdhani’ bypasses Guwahati to bridge time gap,"A special superfast train via Bogibeel, India’s longest rail-road bridge across the Brahmaputra, covers 117 km less than the regular Rajdhani route between New Delhi and Dibrugarh.

Bogibeel, India’s longest rail-and-road bridge across the Brahmaputra, had in December 2018 brought the two “emotionally connected” banks of eastern Assam closer by more than seven hours.

A ‘zero Rajdhani’ train via this 4.94 km bridge has now brought the people of the two banks closer to New Delhi by more than 100 km.

Also read | Bogibeel: from ‘small’ to big

The 02505/02506 between New Delhi and Dibrugarh on October 12 is technically not a Rajdhani, a superfast train whose number starts with 2 while those of mail express trains start with 1. The zero makes it a special train, the likes of which are operated temporarily.

“The train will officially become the biweekly Rajdhani we had planned to introduce from May 3 once train services in the country become regular. The plan had to be shelved because of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Subhanan Chanda, spokesperson of the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR).

Railway officials said the special ‘Rajdhani’ could be the first of its kind, deviating from the definition of such trains – connecting the national capital with the capitals or nearest largest city of the States. The train bypasses Guwahati, Assam’s principal city and the original terminal for the Rajdhani, by some 50 km.

For people in Dibrugarh and the eastern part of Arunachal Pradesh, what matters more is the option of reaching Delhi or any other stations on the route of ‘normal’ Rajdhanis faster. The track via Bogibeel is 117 shorter than the regular Rajdhani route through Guwahati.

Gateway to Arunachal Pradesh

“Our town, one of Assam’s oldest, is often called the gateway to Arunachal Pradesh. But we had to catch superfast trains from Naharlagun [near Arunachal capital Itanagar] to Delhi at Harmuti, about 30 km away. We may not have got the real Rajdhani yet, but the fact that a special one now halts here augurs well for us,” said Sailen Baruah, a resident of North Lakhimpur, headquarters of Assam’s Lakhimpur district.

In pictures | The Bogibeel, an architectural marvel across the Brahmaputra

He said the people of Lakhimpur and Dibrugarh districts had always been psychologically, economically and culturally linked to Dibrugarh but the river in between forced them to maintain distance. The alternative was a 12-hour road trip via the Kaliabhomora bridge across the Brahmaputra miles west of Bogibeel or a time-consuming river ferry service.

The special ‘Rajdhani’ is the fourth pair of passenger trains connecting North Lakhimpur and Dibrugarh since the Tinsukia-Naharlagun Express introduced on December 26, 2018, five days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Bogibeel Bridge.

“The train and road service via Bogibeel not only energised the local economy and cultural exchanges but also helped people in Lakhimpur and Dhemaji district access medical care in Dibrugarh faster. Almost 80% of the passengers of the pre-lockdown trains travelled for treatment or diagnosis,” Mr. Baruah said.

“Faster trains are an alternative to Lilabari Airport, where the frequency of flights has reduced drastically over the years. Some trains have saved us the trouble of staying a night in Guwahati to catch trains or flights out of the region, but the north bank [of Brahmaputra] needs more long-distance trains,” said Sazzad Hussain.

Such was the outflow of patients that a private nursing home had to close down the only intensive care unit in North Lakhimpur, other residents said.

The bridge had also made connectivity between the eastern and western halves of Arunachal Pradesh faster. “We are looking forward to the resumption of regular train services to save on travel time,” said B. Namchoom of Namsai in eastern Arunachal Pradesh.

On the flip side, the bridge has led to traffic congestion in Dibrugarh. “Half the vehicles on the streets here are from Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts,” said local resident Rukmini Bora.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lml5y5/article32880001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/zero-rajdhanijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/zero-rajdhani-bypassing-assam-capital-bridges-time-gap/article32879935.ece
182,2020/10/17,"NEET 2020 | Family’s efforts, own hard work bear fruit for Soyeb","He secures a perfect 720 out of 720 marks in NEET.

As National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET)-2020 results were declared, 18-year-old Soyeb Aftab from Odisha’s Rourkela city found his name atop 7,71,500 aspirants. He made history by securing a perfect 720 out of 720 marks.

While student fraternity and society went gaga over his spectacular feat, the sacrifice of a lower middle class family to use education to move up the social ladder came to the fore.

Since his childhood, Soyeb has been brilliant in his studies. But academic brilliance alone does not ensure success for one in personal and professional space and money matters. And Soyeb’s family understood this reality.

After he secured 96.8% marks in Class X from Desouza’s School, Rourkela, in 2018, the family took a conscious decision to facilitate medical coaching for him at Kota so that he overcomes the cut-throat competition.

In April 2018, Soyeb was not alone to move to Kota to pursue XII studies at Sarvodaya School and coaching simultaneously. His mother, Sultana Razia, a homemaker, went with him. His father, Sheikh Mohammed Abbas, kept working in Rourkela to earn to fund their stay at Kota. Mr. Abbas has tea-leaf business and he also deals with construction material.

“I had come to Kota with a dream that I would clear NEET with a good rank. As time progressed, I received support from teachers and my confidence level went up. I was expecting my ranking in the first 500,” Soyeb told media.

“When my XII results came out and I scored above 90% marks, I thought I would be in top 100. I had never expected 720 out of 720. Even after examination, I was anticipating that my marks would be around 700. I had doubts in two questions and was not sure of few more questions. But when I tallied them with the answer sheet, I realized that all my answers were correct,” he said.

“My father kept working in Rourkela while my mother and little sister stayed with me. I had not been to home during COVID-19 lockdown. In fact, I had stayed in Kota since April 2018 without a vacation. Probably the consistency which I maintained in preparation was the reason behind the feat I have achieved today,” he noted.

Aspiring to study in AIIMS-Delhi, he owed much of his success to his mother. He pointed out that his father, family members and teachers contributed significantly.

“If you are focused on your goal, you are bound to get success. Problems may come and hamper the preparations like the COVID-19 did this year, but students should not take their eye off the objective,” he exhorted.

Mother’s struggles

Ms. Razia has completed her graduation and she knows the value of education. “I stayed with him to ensure that he does not get distracted due to bad food and even I did not let him go to market. I faced all struggles for providing my son a distraction-free atmosphere,” she said.

“He has been a brilliant student since school days. I had never been in doubt that he would not secure NEET rank. It was beyond my expectations that he would create history by getting 720 out of 720,” she said, adding that students should give their best efforts in studies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/education/6knk7w/article32876078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Aftab2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/neet-2020-familys-efforts-own-hard-work-bear-fruit-for-soyeb/article32879857.ece
183,2020/10/17,All India Muslim Personal Law Board to seek public consensus about uniform civil code,"Member says “important decisions pertaining to common civil code and the Babri mosque demolition case” were taken in the meeting on October 11 and October 13

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) will work towards building public opinion against a uniform civil code, saying in a country like India with different cultures and civilisations such a move “will not be justified“.

A decision to this effect was taken in the executive meeting of the board held virtually a few days ago.

AIMPLB member Zafaryab Jilani told PTI on Saturday that “important decisions pertaining to common civil code and the Babri mosque demolition case” were taken in the meeting on October 11 and October 13.

“The board members are of the view that in the agenda of the ruling BJP, now only common civil code is left, and they will proceed in this direction,” he said.

Mr. Jilani said that the board will establish contact with different sections of the society, which could be affected in case the common civil code is implemented, and try to build a consensus and public opinion against it.

“India is a country of different cultures and civilisations, hence implementing this code will not be justified,” he said.

The AIMPLB member also said the board will challenge the special CBI court judgement in the Babri mosque demolition.

“Representatives of the board will appeal against the judgement in the High Court,” he said.

The special court acquitted all 32 accused including BJP veterans L K Advani, M M Joshi and Uma Bharti of involvement in the destruction of Babri Masjid 28 years ago.

In a 2,300-page judgment, the CBI court said there was no conclusive evidence against the accused of being part of any conspiracy to bring down the disputed structure in Ayodhya.

It said vandals were responsible for demolition. Such kar sevaks, who were unruly and rowdy, can never be called Ram bhakts (disciples of the Lord) because their actions adversely affected the secular fabric of the nation, the judge added.

The 16th century mosque was demolished on December 6, 1992 by kar sevaks who believed that it occupied the site where Lord Ram was born, the destruction triggering riots that left hundreds dead in the country and widening rifts between the communities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u9wrcg/article30101043.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ZAFARYABJILANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/all-india-muslim-personal-law-board-to-seek-public-consensus-about-uniform-civil-code/article32879771.ece
184,2020/10/17,BJP leader shot dead in U.P. ahead of Assembly bypoll,"Police have detained three people for questioning in connection with the crime

A local BJP leader was shot dead by bike-borne assailants in Ferozabad district of Uttar Pradesh ahead of the November 3 Assembly bypoll in the area, following which police have detained three people for questioning, an officer said on Saturday.

D.K.Gupta, 46, was shot at in the Nagla Beech area on Friday evening when he was returning home after closing his shop. He was rushed to a hospital where he died.

The police said three people have been detained for questioning based on a complaint filed by Gupta’s family.

Among those detained is Viresh Tomar with whom Gupta had some rivalry, they said, adding that the duo even had an exchange of words on Facebook recently.

Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Sachindra Patel said, “All the angles are being thoroughly examined.”

185,2020/10/17,U.P. told to keep vigil on brick kilns in wake of rising pollution,"Green panel raps State for allowing activity despite curbs

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Uttar Pradesh government to maintain vigil against illegal operation of brick kilns to protect air quality in the National Capital Region.

A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel noted that the industry had a contribution of 5% to 7% of PM10 emissions in winter and summer respectively, to the ambient air of Delhi-NCR.

Illegal operation

“The authorities concerned in the State of U.P. may keep a vigil against illegal operation of brick kilns so as to protect the air quality in NCR,” the Bench said.

The green panel also dismissed an application seeking permission to operate a brick kiln. Earlier, the tribunal had rapped the State government for permitting brick kilns to operate despite prohibition during the lockdown.

The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by petitioner Shailesh Singh and others who sought action against brick kilns that were operating without complying to environmental norms leading to air and water pollution. The plea alleged that 600 brick kilns were operating illegally in the Baghpat district in the absence of requisite clearances from statutory authorities concerned.

186,2020/10/17,Bihar Assembly elections | The din in Dinara is about BJP-LJP undercurrents in this election,"After being denied ticket, the former BJP leader was the first among party veterans to join the Lok Janshakti Party

After being denied ticket, former State BJP vice-president Rajendra Singh was the first among party veterans to join the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) to contest the Assembly poll from Dinara constituency in Rohtas district.

His move was followed by several other party leaders and it quickly triggered speculation that the top BJP leadership might give tacit support to them for any emerging post-poll calculations to form a government in Bihar, which LJP chief Chirag Paswan has repeatedly said will be “a BJP-LJP government this time”.

Though the BJP later expelled the nine leaders from the party to dispel the speculation, at the ground level, the party’s workers were seen distancing themselves from campaigning for the JD(U) candidates, especially in constituencies where such “expelled” party leaders are contesting the poll on LJP ticket.

Also read: Yet again, parties across the spectrum field Bihar’s 'bahubalis'

“BJP-LJP saath saath hain [BJP and LJP are together]”, “Narendra Modi-Amit Shah zindabad” are slogans shouted by people accompanying the “expelled” BJP leaders at campaigns in remote areas of their constituencies.

At Dedhgaon village under Geedha panchayat of Dawath block in Dinara constituency, on October 16, when supporters of Mr. Singh assembled on the campus of the village panchayat and shouted slogans, Mr. Singh smiled a bit while looking at this correspondent and said something in the ear of one of his sloganeering supporters. “Chirag Paswan zindabad, Ram Vilas Paswan zindabad, LJP zindabad” too became part of the chorus.

“The BJP and RSS are in my blood and veins…I have been there for last 37 years…I’ve dedicated my whole life for RSS-BJP”, Mr. Singh told The Hindu on the occasion.

When told that the same party not only denied ticket but also expelled him, Mr. Singh kept mum. “Though, I’ve a lot of pain inside, I have no grudges against anyone”, he said. “I’ve nothing to say on this”, he added, after a long pause.

“Will you be joining the BJP again after winning the poll?” Mr. Singh — again after a long pause — quipped, “Only time will tell…who knows what will happen in future?”.

“Did you meet BJP leader Amit Shah before joining LJP?” He once again kept mum for a while and said, “No such meeting took place”.

Mr. Singh’s main party office at a local hotel-cum-marriage hall at Dinara bazaar, however, has no party flag unfurled or cut-outs, hoardings and posters put up outside. A few vehicles, though, were parked outside and a few people were chatting and taking rest on the ground floor, while rooms on the first floor were occupied by young workers busy forming the campaign plan on the computer with printouts and details of the constituency.

2015 show

In the 2015 election, Mr. Singh, who was said to be the chief ministerial candidate of the BJP, lost by a thin margin of nearly 2,000 votes to JD(U) candidate Jai Kumar Singh. Mr. Singh got over 62,000 votes while Mr. Jai Kumar Singh got 64,000. Mr. Jai Kumar Singh later became IT minister in Nitish Kumar’s Cabinet and is contesting as NDA candidate for the fourth time from the Dinara constituency.

Near Natwar village of the constituency, Mr. Jai Kumar Singh’s cavalcade was escorted by hundreds of bike borne youths unfurling flags of the BJP and JD(U) on their two-wheeler vehicle. When asked, they denied they were BJP workers. “Humlog mantriji ke supporter hain…BJP mantriji ko support kar rahi hai [we’re supporters of the minister…BJP is supporting the minister]”, they yelled and sped away.

Besides these two contenders, RJD candidate Vijay Mandal too has been making his presence felt on the battlefield. The Dinara constituency has about 55, 000 voters of Rajput caste — to which both Mr. Rajendra Singh and Mr. Jai Kumar Singh belong — and 40,000 Yadav, 15,000 Paswan, 10,000 Kushwaha, 15,000 Brahmin and 6,000 Bhumihar voters.

Mr. Rajendra Singh from Gaura village of the constituency too was seen riding on a motorcycle at Dedhgaon and Hathdiha villages and meeting people individually, touching the feet of elders and greeting others with folded hands.

At the village panchayat building campus, he also asked a young supporter to show the villagers a video that had recently gone viral on social media, in which NDA candidate Jai Kumar Singh is allegedly heard telling people that earlier he was known for moving with rifles packed in five vehicles and those opposing him were badly thrashed.

“Now you all should decide whether you want to elect a person who talks about goli-banduk [guns and cartridges] or a person who always has been with you through thick and thin during the last five years, even after losing the poll?”, he asked villagers, and they chorused, “This time you will be our choice, no one else”.

Mr. Singh also listed out the work done by him for the constituency, from construction of roads to medical help. “He has been the only leader who responds to our call and comes to meet us on our invitation whenever we wish”, said a villager Vikas Singh.

Farmers’ issue

But what are the other issues of his constituency he wants to address, if elected? “One of the main issues will be to address the farmers’ problem…you know, this area has famously been known as ‘the rice bowl of Bihar’, for its abundant paddy production, and had over hundreds of rice mills here, but today it has only three-four rice mills”. Why? “Because of the pathetic approach of the State government”, he added promptly.

Does he support the farm laws introduced by the NDA government at the Centre recently? “Yes, they are pro-farmer and a good step by the government for the welfare of the farmers of the country”, he said.

187,2020/10/17,CMs keep away from ‘jinxed’ seats in M.P.,"BJP, Cong. leaders not taking any chances during this by-election

It is believed if the Chief Minister steps inside Ashoknagar Assembly constituency, he loses the next election.

In the past 17 years, none has visited the city. And ahead of the by-election in November, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan too didn’t take chances. Last week, he attended a public meeting for Ashoknagar and Mungaoli Assembly seats in the district, but 9 km away from the city.

With defections which brought down his government piquing him still, Congress leader Kamal Nath too stayed away from Ashoknagar. By attending a meeting 35 km away, he hoped to keep alive chances of storming back to power. The Congress needs 28 seats in its kitty to form the government single-handedly.

At least six Chief Ministers since 1975 have lost power subsequent to their Ashoknagar visits: Congressmen P.C. Sethi, Shyama Charan Shukla, Arjun Singh, Motilal Vora and Digvijaya Singh, and BJP leader Sunderlal Patwa.

For instance, in 1988, Mr. Vora visited the city’s railway station to inaugurate an overbridge, after which he lost power within days, while Mr. Digvijaya Singh visited the city for a candidate, and lost the election in 2003.

Only in March 2019 did Mr. Chouhan visit the city after 2013, following the Assembly election loss. “This is a belief held by both the parties, owing to a few incidents in the past. However, this doesn’t affect campaigning in the area,” said BJP State spokesman Rajneesh Agrawal.

The BJP held just one seat up for the contest, but needs to win at least nine to breach the 115 majority mark to retain power. While 25 seats were vacated as Congress MLAs defected to the BJP, two owing to deaths of sitting Congress legislators.

“We have no reservations about visiting Ashoknagar,” said Congress spokesman Bhupendra Gupta. “The BJP is peddling such myths and instilling superstitions in the minds of voters.”

Similarly, it is believed whoever organises a meeting from the Ramleela stage of the Mela Maidan of Bhander in Datia district loses power, said a local Congress leader requesting anonymity.

This includes former CMs P.C. Sethi, Arjun Singh and Mr. Vora. “Why take chances during crucial election like this? We are refraining from holding any events there for now,” he said.

The Ichhawar Vidhan Sabha seat in Sehore district is another seat considered ‘jinxed’ by the CMs. “The belief is not the stand of any government, but held by locals,” Mr. Agrawal said.

It is also believed that if a campaigner for the Madhanta seat lands at the Narmadanagar helipad, the candidate loses.

In 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for defying superstition by visiting Noida, until then avoided by the Chief Ministers for the fear of losing power. Mr. Modi had said blind faith was not desirable, following which Mr. Chouhan, Chief Minister then, had announced he would visit Ashoknagar too, which never came.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cms-keep-away-from-jinxed-seats-in-mp/article32877298.ece
188,2020/10/17,No coercive action against Sachin Pilot’s media adviser: HC,"Police asked to put up case diary on the next hearing on November 18

The Rajasthan High Court on Friday stayed any coercive action by the police against former Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot’s media adviser Lokendra Singh, who has been booked in a case related to phone tapping of some Congress MLAs.

Mr. Singh and another journalist were accused of spreading “misleading and fake news” on the MLAs shifted to Jaisalmer during the political crisis in the State two months ago.

The FIR, registered at Vidhyakpuri police station in Jaipur on October 1, had charged Mr. Singh and Sharat Kumar, State editor of a TV news channel, with circulating rumours through their reports on an alleged episode of phone tapping of the Congress MLAs, who were sequestered at a resort near Jaisalmer.

The Pilot camp had alleged on August 7 that the phones of some of the legislators were being tapped with the involvement of senior police officers. Though the Police Department denied the allegations, the Opposition BJP had demanded a probe into the episode. The MLAs supporting Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot were shifted for protection against the horse-trading attempts.

Mr. Singh, who handles Mr. Pilot’s press releases on social media, had approached the High Court last week seeking quashing of the FIR. His counsel S.S. Hora contended that no offence was made out against the accused and the filing of FIR was an attempt to curb freedom of speech, while his client faced the threat of arrest on false allegations.

The Single Judge Bench of Justice Goverdhan Bardhar directed in his interim order that no coercive action, including arrest, would be taken against the petitioner and asked the police to put up the case diary on the next date of hearing, November 18.

The case was registered on the complaint of an officer of the cyber crime police station, who said that the allegations of phone tapping were wrong and the publicising of “false information” through social media and news channel, also followed up later by some newspapers, amounted to an offence involving the intent to cause fear in the public.

The FIR had booked the two persons under Sections 505(1)(b) (circulating report with intent to cause fear or alarm), 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code as well as Section 76 (confiscation of computer on contravention of law) of the Information Technology Act.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-coercive-action-against-sachin-pilots-media-adviser-hc/article32877263.ece
189,2020/10/17,Dasara 2020: Have a garba in your living room,"Rekindle the spark in festivities with an indoor garba

A few days ago, friends Disha Sethi and Bhavya Shah decked up in traditional attire to dance the garba and dandiya indoors to a 90-second mashup playlist competing at Garba Ni Ramjat, an all-India virtual competition held by city-based garba choreographer Bina Mehta. “This year’s Navratri be like no other,” says fashion graduate Disha.

This year, the nine-day Dasara festival that begins on October 17 will make a new beginning with virtual prayers and an online dandiya, and garba sessions.

Earlier, Dasara would take a colourful and exuberant form in these dance festivities organised across Hyderabad. Three major Navratri events at SS Convention, Shamshabad, SNC Convention in Attapur and Kavita Jain’s Navkar Navaratri Utsav attracted thousands, dressed in their traditional best, dance to the songs belted out by DJs, live bands and an orchestra.

The pandemic changed all that. Disha who has been dancing at garba since a decade says, “Initially it felt weird to dance indoors. One feels energised in a large gathering and live music. In a virtual session, the magic of the crowd is missing but one can have fun by creating one’s own playlist and dance.”

Unexpected participation

The spark in festivities can be rekindled with virtual sessions, observes Krupa Patel, a host of these garba/dandiya nights. “Fifty one women from across the country had sent their garba videos for the virtual garba competition; We did not expect this kind of participation,” she says. Buoyed by the response, Krupa is now organising a virtual garba session on October 18 for Rotary Club. The event will be judged by actress Regina Cassandra. Also on October 22, 23 and 24, Piyush Shah will host a Navratri photo contest to preserve a moment in time and relive memories.

Dance teacher Ambica Jain of Rangmanch Studio in Himayatnagar will have a Dasara virtual garba camp for children from October 17. She is giving the annual workshop that she conducts a miss in favour of hosting online sessions. Last year the dance academy had called garba teacher Veeru Mallik to conduct classes. “Garba is all about moving according to the music. Move at your pace and the virtual session will be fun,” she promises.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/xli9fu/article32879070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym17garba1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/rekindle-the-spark-in-festivities-with-online-garba/article32879071.ece

191,2020/10/17,Demand for festival special trains likely to be muted,"With the COVID-19 pandemic not abating anytime soon, the demand for the festival special trains which will stop at Coimbatore Junction is expected to be less.

Salem Division of Southern Railway recently announced that festival special trains will be run between Thiruvananthapuram and Shalimar (Train No.02641/42), Howrah and Ernakulam (Train No. 02877/78), and Yesvantpur to Kannur (Train No. 06537/38) to clear extra rush. The trains will have stoppages at Coimbatore Junction and their operations will commence from next week.

Sources in the Salem Division said on Saturday that no special arrangements for crowd management were made at Coimbatore Railway Station ahead of the operations of the festival trains. It is expected that the occupancy for the trains will be less at least in the initial few days due to the pandemic.

College students, professionals employed in the IT sector and senior citizens are the three largest groups of commuters who frequently travel in trains. With colleges being closed, professionals being asked to work from home and senior citizens being advised not to travel due to the pandemic, the demand is not expected to be normal, according to the sources. As passengers might fear that long-distance travel in trains might pose a risk, those who could afford might prefer flights over trains amid the COVID-19 situation, the sources said.

The ticket counters at the passenger reservation system in Coimbatore Railway Station have been reduced to three from five and due to less demand for the existing train services, the railway sources said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ge8e9/article32883348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB18-RLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/demand-for-festival-special-trains-likely-to-be-muted/article32883350.ece

196,2020/10/17,Tribal people to offer prayers in protest at temple in forest area,"Condemning the Forest Department for removing the stone idols from Pisil Mariamman temple at Arapalayam Junction in Hasanur, members of Tamil Nadu Tribal People Association have decided to offer prayers on the temple premises on October 19.

The temple is located inside the forest area coming under the Hasanur Division of Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR). On October 13, forest personnel attempted to remove the idols from the temple that was opposed by the local people. However, the officials took the idols in their vehicles stating that idols kept in the open in forest areas would be removed.

This evoked stiff opposition from the local community. S. Mohan Kumar, district convener of the association, said there were 268 temples located inside the forest areas of STR and tribal people and others were offering prayers for many centuries. “These temples do not have compound walls or towers and are located in the open with idols of gods or stones,” he said.

After the Sathyamangalam forest areas were notified as tiger reserve, the department was refusing the traditional rights of tribal people. “Forest officials had tied a rope to the stone and pulled it with the help of a vehicle despite opposition,” he said and added that people were asked to relocate temples located in forest areas. Forest Rights Act, 2006 gave right to the tribal people to offer prayers at temples located inside forest areas. “But Hasanur Forest Division officials had acted against the law,” he said and added that their act was a crime under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Act, 1989.

Hence, demanding installation of the idols and initiating action against Hasanur DFO, Hasanur Ranger and other forest personnel by registering cases under SC/ST Act, tribal people led by former MLA P.L. Sundaram would offer prayers at the temple, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mmsxje/article32882972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA18FOREST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tribal-people-to-offer-prayers-in-protest-at-temple-in-forest-area/article32882973.ece

With the resumption of omni bus services in the State, around 30 buses from the Omni Bus Terminus at Gandhipuram in the city were operated to various destinations within the State on Friday.

199,2020/10/17,Two held with fake currency notes,"ERODE

Two persons, who circulated counterfeit currencies were arrested by the police here on Friday.

On Thursday night, two persons, M. Satheesh (23) and S. Soundarrajan (20), both from Manickampalayam, gave four ₹500 notes at the eatery located inside the Tasmac outlet at Narayanavalasu on Nasiyanur Road and attempted to purchase snacks. Balu, working at the shop, found the currencies to be fake and alerted Erode North Police Station. When Balu questioned the two, both fled the shop. Later, the police picked up the two.

Inquiries revealed that the duo did not have money to spend and hence made colour photocopies of currencies by watching videos in social media. They had photo copied denominations of ₹500, ₹200 and ₹100 notes and tried their hands at the shop. The police seized colour printers, fake currencies, a two-wheeler and a car.

A case under Sections 489 (B) (using as genuine, forged or counterfeit currency notes or bank notes) and 489 (C) (possession of forged or counterfeit currency notes or bank notes) of IPC was registered. Both were arrested and produced in the court and lodged at prison.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/two-held-with-fake-currency-notes/article32876950.ece
200,2020/10/17,Farmers oppose Coimbatore-Pollachi bypass road project,"To be developed at ₹62 crore

The district road safety committee recently approved the Coimbatore-Pollachi bypass road project, which will be developed at ₹62 crore.

The 23.7 km road from Kovilpalayam to Coimbatore, through Chettipalayam, will involve acquisition of 25 acres. It is expected to bring down traffic on the existing road.

However, the project is opposed by farmers. “I will lose my land. We have repeatedly appealed to the officials concerned to modify the alignment. But, they are not willing to do so. The proposed alignment passes through several farms,” said Nataraj of Kondampatti village.

K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, said the Coimbatore-Pollachi highways road has been widened. The proposed alignment for the bypass is through small villages and is an unnecessary project.

The Highways Department should re-think this project. There are several other road projects that are needed for Coimbatore. These should be taken up. If there can be a bypass road for Pollachi, there can be bypass roads for Mettupalayam and Tiruppur too. This seems to be an unwanted expenditure and the Department should drop this project, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/farmers-oppose-coimbatore-pollachi-bypass-road-project/article32876922.ece
201,2020/10/17,SFI cadre stage protest,"Demand the resignation of Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa

A few cadre of the Students Federation of India (SFI) staged a protest in front of the Coimbatore Collectorate on Friday opposing the move to split Anna University into two and demanding the resignation of Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa.

The protesters said splitting the University into two with one as an unitary institution and another as an affiliating institution and declaring the former as an institution of eminence, as per Government of India guidelines, would lead to commercialisation of education. It would pave way for appointment of foreign faculty and make engineering education beyond the reach of students from economically weaker and deprived sections of the society.

That the Vice-Chancellor Mr. Surappa had chosen to write directly to the Government of India by bypassing the State Government was reason enough for his removal and therefore the SFI wanted him removed, the protesters said.

The protesters also appealed to the State Government to not accept the Central Government’s proposal saying it would not be able to implement the 69% reservation system that was in vogue in the State.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/afv3ao/article32876884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB17PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/sfi-cadre-stage-protest/article32876885.ece
202,2020/10/17,Land acquisition for Pilloor III watersupply project to begin soon,"Collector likely to issue the notification sometime next week

The Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board’s efforts to acquire land to execute the Pilloor III drinking water supply project for the city got a boost with the State Government enhancing district collector’s powers for land acquisition.

The Government, through G.O. 526 of September26, has enhanced from 40 acre to 1,482 acre the land acquisition power of collector in respect of public purpose project.

This, sources say, means that Coimbatore Collector K. Rajamani can now issue the necessary notification for the Board to acquire the 125 acre required for laying the Pilloor III drinking water pipeline.

In the absence of the G.O., the administration would have sent the land acquisition proposal to the Commissioner for Land Administration for issuance of necessary notification. Now this is being done at the district level. And, the Collector is likely to issue the notification sometime next week, the sources add.

Once the notification is issued, the administration will begin the process of fixing price for the lands to acquired, village-wise to proceed with the process of acquisition.

The TWAD Board requires the land to convey water from where it draws water (headworks) to the raw water treatment plant and from there to the master storage reservoir – in short, it requires land to lay pipeline for 30-plus km at 15 m width.

This is only a part of the Pilloor III project, though. Sources in the TWAD Board say the third package of the project, which involves digging a 986-metre-long tunnel in Kattan hills to lay pipeline, has just begun.

The company entrusted with the ₹ 63 crore package has progressed tunnelling 50m and in the next 15 months, it will complete the work. Likewise, the second package worth ₹ 104 crore to construct a raw water treatment plant has also taken off, the sources say.

As for the construction of a master storage reservoir of 146 lakh litre, the Board has floated tender and on October 21, it is opening the tender to choose the lowest bidder, the sources add.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/land-acquisition-for-pilloor-iii-watersupply-project-to-begin-soon/article32876863.ece
203,2020/10/17,"Five held for extortion attempt, robbery near Avinashi","The Perumanallur police arrested a gang of five members, including a woman, for allegedly robbing two men of gold chain and cash and trying to extort money from them near Avinashi in Tiruppur district on Thursday.

Police said that the complainant, Natarayan (56), owned a power loom unit in Vellakoil. His relative Kumar received a call from Kavitha aka Vennila (26), who invited them for a business deal involving purchase of bedsheets in bulk. Due to persistent calls, Natarayan and Kumar obliged and visited Kavitha’s residence in Perumanallur on Tuesday.

The woman, along with four other men, locked the two inside a room. They stole Natarayan’s gold chain worth around ₹ 60,000 and Kumar’s smart phone and cash worth ₹ 3,000. Following this, the gang forced the two men to strip down to their underwear and made them stand next to the woman for a photograph. They gang demanded ₹ 3 lakh from the two, failing which the they threatened to upload the pictures on social media platforms, the police said.

The two men were locked for four hours in the house. After being allowed to leave around 11 p.m., Natarayan lodged a complaint at the Perumanallur police station. The police registered a case under Sections 342 (Wrongful confinement), 385 (Putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion), 397 (Robbery or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

On Thursday, the police arrested Kavitha along with Isakkipandi (30), Isakkimuthu (27), Jebaraj (24) and Chinnadurai (29). Investigations revealed that the accused had similar cases against them in Tirunelveli district and the woman was from Karnataka.

204,2020/10/17,Western bypass: delay in de-notifyingland puts landowners in a fix,"Plots remain blocked for registration though a new alignment has been finalised

People who own land along the old alignment for the proposed western bypass road project are in a fix, as their plots remain blocked for registration though a new alignment has been finalised.

Almost a month ago, the Revenue Department issued a communication to the Registration Department regarding details of lands identified for acquisition as per the new alignment. The Registration Department too has stopped registering lands in these areas. The details were shared with the local bodies and Local Planning Authority too.

However, the communication does not mention the old alignment and the need to release the lands blocked for registration in these areas. This has resulted in people owning lands along the old alignment unable to sell their lands.

Further, the delay in communicating the new alignment has increased the guideline value in those areas.

According to K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, since 2010, there is talk of the western bypass road. Those with land along the old alignment are suffering for long because of the time taken to finalise the new alignment and notifying it. With the land along the old alignment yet to be released, the land owners are affected. It is such issues that make land acquisition challenging for infrastructure projects. Further, delays lead to higher guideline values. Some owners along the new alignment may have constructed buildings and the government has to now pay compensation for buildings too. For any infrastructure project, land should be identified without delay for acquisition and these should be notified and communicated to all departments and officials concerned at the earliest. This will make the acquisition process simpler and bring down the cost of acquisition too, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/western-bypass-delay-in-de-notifyingland-puts-landowners-in-a-fix/article32876785.ece
205,2020/10/17,Of Steve Waugh & his depiction of the alluring appeal of cricket in India,"His book The Spirit of Cricket — India contains over 200 photographs captured by him during his many trips

He played for Australia but captured the cricket of India, in all its kaleidoscopic forms.

While delving deep into the world of cricket in India, Steve Waugh saw the game which is more a way of life here, being played by monks at the foothills of the Himalayas.

He saw the sport being played on the beaches, the deserts, the mountains.

The much-admired Australian great was swept off his feet by the sight of a disabled player, being supported by a bamboo on one side, “flying through the air like ninja warriors” while hurling the ball.

He was equally enamoured by dreamy-eyed youngsters playing on the dusty grounds of the famous Azad Maidan in Mumbai.

“This place reeked of cricket and I loved it,” Waugh said of the Azad Maidan, according to abc.net.au.

Quite amazing

“They’re quite amazing, these guys, flying through the air like ninja warriors and landing on these bamboo poles,” he said.

The book The Spirit of Cricket — India by Waugh contains over 200 photographs captured by the former Australia captain during his many trips to the cricket-mad country.

A collection of over 70 photographs clicked by Waugh will be on display during an exhibition in Sydney at the end of this month.

“India gave me lifelong memories, but life-changing moments,” Waugh said.

“The concept of this book was to try and find out why cricket is a religion in India.”

Over 18 days and with a camera in hand, Waugh toured across the country, from the streets of Mumbai and Jodhpur, the alleys of Kolkata to the desert in Rajasthan and the Himalayan foothills.

A documentary of his trip, titled Capturing Cricket, will be aired on the ABC on November 17.

Speaking of cricket in the country, he was quoted as saying, “It’s hard to overstate the importance of cricket to a country like India.

“There’s 800 million people living below the poverty line, but cricket gives them something to connect with.

“It’s a sport that doesn’t take a lot of money. I mean, I often say about cricket, all you need is a bat and ball.”

In a country that loves the game so much, it was difficult for one of Australia’s most well-known cricketers to go unrecognised, as he went from one place to another.

“I don’t think I’ve met a person in India that doesn’t know [I] play cricket,” Waugh said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wy8rj7/article32883188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18WAUGH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/of-steve-waugh-his-depiction-of-the-alluring-appeal-of-cricket-in-india/article32883189.ece
206,2020/10/17,"Indian Premier League 2020 | Step up, Morgan tells his lads","‘We have to be as adaptable as possible going forward’

New Kolkata Knight Riders captain Eoin Morgan said it was high time his team raised its game after its eight-wicket loss to Mumbai Indians at Abu Dhabi on Friday.

At the post-match media conference, asked about his take on the KKR top-order “which did not apply itself”, Morgan said, “I think that’s putting it very politely. With the bat early on we made a few mistakes. MI bowled really well… It's another area of improvement that we need to make strides on.

“We've just passed the halfway stage and there's no better time to turn things around. Given the strength and depth in our batting line-up and the different skill levels and skill-sets, we have to be as adaptable as possible going forward.”

Morgan hoped for a smooth transition in leadership from Dinesh Karthik. “It took a lot of courage and selflessness from DK… within our group we have a number of leaders that we will need throughout this competition.”

Morgan said Pat Cummins’ focus on golf had improved his batting. “…he is hitting the golf ball really well,” said Morgan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/vnwurp/article32882976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18MORGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/step-up-morgan-tells-his-lads/article32882977.ece
207,2020/10/17,Indian Premier League | Krunal — playing his role to perfection,"Has picked up five wickets at a respectable economy rate

Kieron Pollard hasn’t been bowling much of late. Hardik Pandya is yet to bowl during the ongoing edition of the Indian Premier League due to his back injury management. Pandya Sr., Krunal, was thus expected to carry the mantle of being the lead all-rounder for Mumbai Indians.

With an on-song batting line-up, Krunal has been largely playing as a containing spinner. And he has played his role to near-perfection as Mumbai Indians has begun defending its crown with aplomb.

Numbers neither reflect his contribution to MI’s winning run nor to his chances of regaining his place in India’s T20 squad.

But Krunal isn’t really worried about it.

“I also want to come back into the Indian team. If you see the games I have played for India, I have done well in terms of the bowling I did. I got Man of the Match awards. Overall I was happy with the journey with the Indian team. I am looking forward to making a comeback,” Krunal said on Saturday, ahead of Mumbai Indians’ weekend clash versus Kings XI Punjab.

In his 26 overs of left-arm spin in eight matches, Krunal has picked up five wickets at a respectable economy rate of 7.80. As for batting, he has been able to face just 34 balls, scoring 48 runs, with the four-ball 20 not out against Sunrisers being the highlight.

Team first

“At the end of the day, I have never thought about it as an individual. I have always believed in keeping the team first, be it for India, Mumbai Indians or Baroda.

“Sometimes, if the required run-rate is 15 and you bowl a 6-run over, that is as good as a four-wicket haul. That 4-ball 20 against SRH created an impact and brought the momentum back for us. I never think about those big runs or picking wickets. It is about what is important for the team.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/1m3gvl/article32882939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18KRUNAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/krunal-playing-his-role-to-perfection/article32882940.ece
208,2020/10/17,IPL 2020: DC VS CSK | Dhawan-powered DC edges CSK,"Axar hits three sixes in final over to ensure opener’s 101 n.o. doesn’t go in vain

Shikhar Dhawan made Chennai Super Kings pay a heavy price for some shoddy fielding as he slammed an unbeaten 101 (58b, 14x4, 1x6) to carry Delhi Capitals to a five-wicket win at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Saturday.

CSK’s butterfingered fielders dropped the opener four times as the side succumbed to its sixth defeat even as DC went top of the table.

Despite Dhawan’s knock, DC still needed 17 off the last over, but Axar Patel punished Ravindra Jadeja, slamming three sixes to seal the match with a ball to spare.

Death-overs specialist Dwayne Bravo had one over left, but the West Indian had left the field for some treatment and Dhoni had to choose between Jadeja and Karn Sharma.

Leather hunt

Chasing 180, DC lost Prithvi Shaw and Ajinkya Rahane cheaply to Deepak Chahar, but Dhawan sent the CSK bowlers on a leather hunt, starting with Sam Curran, hitting him for two fours.

Cashing in on the two reprieves he received when on 25 and 27, the Delhi batsman wasted no time in attacking Karn next, hitting him for two boundaries in the leggie’s first over. He brought up his fifty off 29 balls. Dhoni spilled Dhawan while diving to his left off Bravo when on 50. The southpaw was dropped for the fourth time on 80 by Ambati Rayudu.

In between these chances, the left-hander was at his fluent best, charging bowlers at will and unleashing his brute power, to record his maiden IPL century.

Earlier, Faf du Plessis’s half-century (58, 47b, 6x4, 2x6) followed by cameos from Rayudu (45 n.o., 25b, 1x4, 4x6) and Jadeja (33 n.o., 13b, 4x6) helped CSK post 179 for four.

du Plessis and Shane Watson (36) put on 87 for the second wicket, before Rayudu and Jadeja finished the innings strongly, slamming 67 in the final five overs.

In the 20th over, Jadeja hit consecutive sixes off Nortje and scored 16 runs to give CSK a fighting chance. But all of it was undone by a disastrous fielding effort.

209,2020/10/17,IPL 2020: RR vs RCB | De Villiers’ genius drags RCB across the line,"Rajasthan Royals are fielding an unchanged side, while Royal Challengers Bangalore made couple of changes.

For the second time in six days, A.B. de Villiers swung a game Royal Challengers Bangalore's way with a blinder of a knock.

Rajasthan Royals, which made 177 for six at the Dubai International Stadium after winning the toss, was beaten by seven wickets with two balls to spare.

If his 33-ball 73 had set up RCB's victory, batting first against Kolkata Knight Riders at Sharjah earlier in the week, de Villiers put on a masterclass in chasing down an imposing target on Saturday. His 55 not out came off just 22 balls (1x4, 6x6).

Its sixth win in nine matches helped RCB stay in the vicinity of the two standout teams of the competition, Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals, with 12 points. RR remains near the bottom, on six points.

When RCB’s two set batsmen had returned to the dugout off successive balls, RR may have sensed an opportunity.

Opener Devdutt Padikkal (35, 37b, 2x4) and Virat Kohli (43, 32b, 1x4, 2x6) had put on 79 for the second wicket.

When the captain succumbed to a brilliant piece of fielding by Rahul Tewatia at deep mid-wicket — he caught the ball on the run, released it before he went over the rope and came back in to complete the catch — 76 was needed off 41 balls.

It was 35 off 12 when Steve Smith handed the ball to Jaydev Unadkat. The left-arm seamer's first three balls were dispatched over the on-side boundary by de Villiers in imperious style.

Turning the tide

Twenty-five runs came off the penultimate over. de Villiers then finished the job by sending RR’s best bowler Jofra Archer over the deep mid-wicket boundary.

Earlier, a rejigged batting line-up helped RR post a competitive total. The decision to send in Robin Uthappa as opener paid dividends. He made a sparkling 41 (22b, 7x4, 1x6) and put on 50 for the first wicket with Ben Stokes, who became one of Chris Morris’ four victims.

Smith finally returned to form, too, scoring 57 (36b, 6x4, 1x6). But later on in the afternoon, de Villiers made it a match to forget for RR.

The AB sizzler

de Villiers’ unbeaten 55 came off just 22 deliveries

The South African hammered six sixes and a four

With 35 needed off two overs, 25 were scored off the penultimate over bowled by Unadkat

210,2020/10/17,Indian Premier League 2020 | Rampaging Mumbai up against Gayle-inspired Punjab,"A win for Mumbai Indians will virtually seal them a spot in the play-offs while a loss for KXIP could send them out of contention.

They have been in rampaging form with five straight wins but Mumbai Indians can ill afford to be complacent against a Chris Gayle-inspired Kings XI Punjab side in their IPL game in Dubai on Sunday.

A win for Mumbai Indians will virtually seal them a spot in the play-offs while a loss for KXIP could send them out of contention.

Mumbai Indians have steamrolled opposition teams with an explosive batting line-up complemented by a lethal bowling attack and the latest side to bear their brunt were the Kolkata Knight Riders who suffered an eight-wicket defeat on Friday.

Tabble-toppers MI boast of top batsmen such as captain Rohit Sharma (251 runs) and his opening partner Quinton de Kock (269) and both are in good touch, while the middle-order is manned by the likes of Suryakumar Yadav (243 runs) and Ishan Kishan (186 runs).

Rohit played second fiddle to de Kock in MI’s win against KKR, with the South African hitting 78 not out from 44 balls.

In the bowling front, pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult have formed the most successful pair this IPL with 12 wickets apiece from eight matches so far. Spinner Rahul Chahar chipped in against KKR with two wickets for 18 runs.

On the other hand, KXIP are languishing at the bottom of the table despite having the top-two leading run-getters of the tournament in skipper K L Rahul (387 runs at a strike rate of 134.84) and his opening partner, Mayank Agarwal (337 runs).

KXIP’s problem has been that their batting and bowling have not fired in unison on most occasions even though their confidence has been boosted by the return of Gayle.

The self-proclaimed ‘Universe Boss’ made his first appearance this IPL with a bang, hitting a 45-ball 53, a knock that was laced with five sixes and a four in KXIP’s win over Virat Kohli’s Royal Challengers Bangalore.

A captivating duel may be in store between Gayle on one side and Bumrah and Boult on the other.

KXIP have other in-form batsmen in Rahul and Agarwal, with both or at least one of them scoring big in almost every match.

But their bowling has been the weakest link. Barring Mohammad Shami and Ravi Bishnoi, none of the bowlers have inspired confidence, especially in the death overs.

Not being able to find the right balance despite trying out many options has also contributed to KXIP’s rapid slide.

The Teams (From):

211,2020/10/17,IPL 2020 | KKR aim to sort out batting woes under new captain in clash against SRH,"SRH is facing a conundrum of whether to strengthen their batting or their bowling unit, a fact that skipper David Warner conceded.

A new captain in the saddle, Kolkata Knight Riders would look to sort out their batting woes and strive for consistency when they face Sunrisers Hyderabad in an intriguing mid-table Indian Premier League clash here on Sunday.

After a string of below par performances, Dinesh Karthik handed over the reins to his deputy Eoin Morgan hours before KKR’s match against Mumbai Indians on Friday. But the World Cup-winning England captain’s campaign as leader was off to a disappointing start with MI handing KKR an eight-wicket mauling.

KKR are still in the top four in the IPL points table behind Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore with four wins and as many defeats. But if the two-time champions want to seal a play-off spot, their batsmen need to step up, shrug off their inconsistencies and win matches for the team.

After a massive 82-run loss to RCB, the KKR batsmen failed yet again against MI bowlers as they were reduced to 42 for 4 in the eighth over. Half of KKR batsmen were gone for 61 in the 11th over. An 87-run unbroken stand for the sixth wicket between Morgan (39 not out) and pacer Pat Cummins (53 not out) took them to 148 for 5.

But MI needed just 16.5 overs to overhaul the target, losing two wickets in the process.

At the top, Shubhman Gill has failed to capitalise on his starts, while Rahul Tripathi has not gone past the 20-run mark after his brilliant 81 against the Chennai Super Kings.

Nitish Rana has been profligate and Karthik’s batting slot has been experimented with throughout the tournament. Andre Russell and Morgan have also not been able to make the kind of impact expected from players of their calibre.

The KKR bowlers did well to fashion narrow victories against Kings XI Punjab and CSK, but leaked runs against RCB and MI. To add to their woes, star spinner Sunil Narine has been reported for suspect bowling action and he has missed two matches since then.

The Sunrisers, who occupy the fifth spot on the points table with just three wins from eight outings, are also struggling. With the injuries ruling out pace spearhead Bhuvneshwar Kumar and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh, the Orange Army is facing a conundrum of whether to strengthen their batting or their bowling unit, a fact that skipper David Warner conceded.

The team heavily relies on its batting unit, mainly on the top four comprising Jonny Bairstow, Warner, Manish Pandey and Kane Williamson.

Rashid factor

A cause of concern for the Sunrisers is Rashid Khan’s form. After returning impressive figures like 3/14, 0/12, 3/12, the Afghan leg-spinner remained ineffective in the team’s last two losses. Rahul Tewatia, Ambati Rayudu and Shane Watson smashed him for sixes.

Skipper Warner will desperately hope that his star spinner finds his mojo back which is imperative for the team’s success.

212,2020/10/17,IPL 2020 | Morgan blames top-order batting failure for KKR’s loss against MI,"Batting order will need to be flexible, adapting according to the respective opposition, he said.

Kolkata Knight Riders captain Eoin Morgan blamed top-order batting failure for his side’s comprehensive defeat to Mumbai Indians in their IPL match and said they need to “turn things around” quickly.

Electing to bat, KKR were reduced to 42 for 4 in the eighth over and half of their batsmen were gone for 61 in the 11th over. An 87-run unbroken stand for the sixth wicket between Morgan (39 not out) and fast bowler Pat Cummins (53 not out) took them to a respectable 148 for 5.

But, Mumbai Indians needed just 16.5 overs to overhaul the target for the loss of two wickets to record an eight-wicket win on Friday.

“That’s putting it very politely. With the batting early on, we made a few mistakes. Mumbai Indians bowled really well and proved exactly why they have been one of the form teams in the tournament so far,” Morgan said at the post match press conference.

“From here on, there is another area of improvement that we need to make strides on. We’re just past the half-way stage in the tournament. There is no better time to turn things around,” said the Englishman who was elevated to captaincy on Friday after Dinesh Karthik stepped down.

Morgan said the KKR batting order will need to be flexible, adapting according to the respective opposition.

“Given the strength and depth we have in our batting-line, and the different skill-levels and skill-sets that we have, we have to be as adaptable as possible going forward,” the England limited-over skipper said.

“With playing against different opposition, there are different match-ups that we feel we can make the most of our batting line-up, and hence the continued change in the order,” he said.

He said KKR had a smooth transition after Karthik decided to step down from captaincy to focus on his batting.

“Within a team of leaders, given that myself and Dinesh were leaders in captain and vice-captain, I think there will be a smooth transition from here. It took a lot of courage for DK and actually quite a lot of selflessness to come forward and recognise within himself that he wanted to focus on his batting and take the vice captaincy up, said Morgan.

“Therefore, I became captain and it is a great opportunity for me to lead the team. Like I said, within our group of players, we have a number of leaders and we will need throughout this competition,” he added.

On Cummins who top-scored for KKR, Morgan said the team looks at the Australian as an “all-rounder”. He said focussing on golf on this trip has helped Cummins in his batting.

For Mumbai Indians, it was their fifth win on the trot but opener Quinton de Kock said it was all about taking one game at a time and the team has not started preparations for the play-offs.

“No, the preparations for play-offs haven’t started. We are taking every game as it comes. Whatever happens we got to keep it simple, stay humble in the way we do things and play to our strengths, that’s all we can control for now,” he said.

“Whether we get to play-offs or not, it is not really controllable, but yes we are here to try and play the best cricket we can,” said the South African who top-scored for MI with 78 not out off 44 balls.

He praised leg-spinner Rahul Chahar, who bagged two wickets for 18 runs.

“He (Chahar) backs himself, which is a key thing in a player. He knows his talent and he knows if he has a bad game he is going to come back stronger. He is hungry on what he does, so it is good to see. Obviously, all we can do as players is just to keep backing him,” de Kock said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/uw5wll/article32879452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THPTIEOINMORGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-morgan-blames-top-order-batting-failure-for-kkrs-loss-against-mi/article32879453.ece

Pakistan speedster Umar Gul on Saturday announced he will retire from all forms of cricket after the end of the ongoing National T20 Cup.

The 36-year-old Gul, who played his last match for Pakistan - an ODI - in 2016, featured for Balochistan team in the National T20 Cup, which ends on Sunday.

His side lost against Southern Punjab (Pakistan) in Rawalpindi on Friday to be out of reckoning for the semifinals.

“With a very heavy heart and after a lot of thinking, i have decided to bid farewell to all formats of cricket after this National T20 Cup,” the 36-year-old wrote on his Twitter handle.

“I have always played for Pakistan with all my heart and 100% of hardwork. Cricket is and will always be my love and passion but all good things have to come to an end,” he added.

The Peshawar-born Gul made his international debut in an ODI in 2003. He played his first Test that year itself. His last Test was against South Africa in 2013.

From 47 Test matches, Gul took 163 wickets at an average of 34.06. He also claimed 179 wickets from 130 ODIs, besides 85 wickets from 60 T20Is.

“Praying that the future will hold much more for me. Secondly, I would like to thank @TheRealPCB and all the coaches and people who have been a part of my cricketing journey.

Left-handed batsmen Darren Bravo and Shimron Hetmyer and allrounder Keemo Paul are back in the West Indies Test squad for a two-match series in New Zealand but Shai Hope has been dropped.

Bravo’s highest Test score of 218 came in Dunedin, New Zealand in 2013.

Hope, a veteran of 34 Tests, has had a poor recent run in Test cricket. He’s averaged 19.48 since December 2017 and just 14.45 since February 2019, lowering his career Test average to 26.27.

A group of six reserves will also travel to New Zealand to help prepare the Test squad during a quarantine period and training camp as well as cover for injuries.

Wicketkeeper Andre Fletcher was in the Twenty20 squad for the first time since 2018 for a three-game series in New Zealand next month preceding the Tests.

Allrounder Kyle Mayers has also been included for the first time after starring in the recent Caribbean Premier League.

Allrounder Andre Russell and top-order batsmen Lendl Simmons and Evin Lewis opted not to tour because of travel concerns and quarantines related to the pandemic.

The T20 series is set to start on Nov. 27 in Auckland, followed by games in Mount Maunganui on Nov. 29 and 30. The Tests are scheduled for Dec. 3-7 at Seddon Park in Hamilton and from Dec. 11-15 at the Basin Reserve in Wellington.

215,2020/10/17,"Indian Premier League 2020, MI vs KKR | We were clinical in both batting and bowling: Rohit Sharma","“[We were] clinical with the ball, clinical with the bat, overall you know, the performance that we were expecting was there,” Rohit said the presentation ceremony.

Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma on October 16 said his team lived up to the expectations with its clinical showing in both batting and bowling, which culminated in an eight-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL in Abu Dhabi.

After the bowlers restricted KKR to 148 for five, opener Quinton de Kock blazed his way to 78 off 44 balls to complete the task for Mumbai.

“[We were] clinical with the ball, clinical with the bat, overall you know, the performance that we were expecting was there,” Rohit said the presentation ceremony.

“It is always a challenge when you have won four out of four, how you turn on that particular day, it is very important and I thought we turned up really well, right from the start we were there on their faces.”

According to Rohit, he usually takes a backseat when batting with de Kock, who likes to take on the bowlers from the word go.

“I enjoy batting with him [De Kock], he is very straightforward on what he wants to do and most of the time I have taken a backseat because he likes to take on the bowlers right from the word go.

“I probably assess the situation, I have a role to play in the squad and I try and do that more often.

“But I want Quinny to bat the way he is batting and he shouldn’t be taking any sort of pressure about what the team is expecting from him, as long he keeps doing what he loves to do, we are in good position,” added Rohit.

Rohit said the victory was special as the team chased successfully, which could be the trend in the second half of the tournament.

“It gives us a lot of confidence, that has been the trend so far in the first half of the tournament, team batting second have lost many games.

“So I guess it is changing now, the second half of the tournament, teams batting second will win most of the games, that’s what I feel,” he said.

KKR’s new captain Eoin Morgan conceded that losing early wickets did not help their cause.

“Being four and five down early really cost us, we managed to get a score on the board, but when Mumbai come out and play like that it is difficult to stop momentum.

”... So full credit to them, they played really well and we have got a lot of lessons to learn, particularly with the bat today,” Morgan said.

“The guys fought hard with the ball, but not just enough runs on a wicket like that,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/s6f5mm/article32878248.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ROHITSHARMA-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-mi-vs-kkr-we-were-clinical-in-both-batting-and-bowling-rohit-sharma/article32878249.ece

The Delhi High Court on Friday stayed proceedings against Congress leader Shashi Tharoor before a trial court here in a defamation case filed against him for his alleged “scorpion” remark against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Justice Suresh Kumar Kait passed the direction while hearing the plea of the Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram challenging the trial court order summoning him in the defamation complaint filed by Delhi BJP leader Rajeev Babbar.

Next hearing

The High Court has posted the case for further hearing on December 9.

Mr Tharoor has sought quashing of the April 27, 2019 order of a trial court summoning him on the criminal defamation complaint filed in 2018 by Mr. Babbar who said his religious sentiments were hurt by the Congress leader’s statement.

Mr. Tharoor had allegedly claimed in October 2018 that an unnamed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader had compared Mr. Modi to “a scorpion sitting on a shivling”.

The former Union Minister has also sought quashing of the complaint. The complaint was filed under Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code, relating to defamation.

In June 2019, a Delhi court had granted bail to Mr. Tharoor in relation to the case.

Mr. Babbar, in his complaint, stated that Mr. Tharoor made the alleged scandalous remarks at the Bangalore Literature Festival on October 28.

He said Mr. Tharoor’s statement was not only “an abuse of the Hindu deity but also defamatory and an insult to BJP workers, supporters and leaders”. He added that his religious sentiments were hurt by the statement as it was not only “baseless but also misleading and defamatory”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-hc-stays-proceedings-against-shashi-tharoor-in-defamation-case/article32877185.ece

222,2020/10/17,Delhi govt. defends decision on bed reservation for COVID-19 patients,"‘Policy decision taken with an intent to mitigate surge of virus cases in Delhi’

The Delhi government on Thursday defended before the Delhi High Court its decision directing 33 private hospitals to reserve 80% of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients. It said the policy decision was taken as a stop-gap measure with an intent to mitigate the surge of virus cases in the national capital.

In an affidavit filed before Justice Navin Chawla, the Delhi government denied that the decision, which was stayed by the High Court on September 22, was in violation of any fundamental right of the citizens of Delhi and termed the petition by ‘Association of Healthcare Providers’ as “wholly misplaced and baseless”.

The High Court granted one week time to the petitioner association, which claims that the 33 private hospitals against whom the order was passed are its members and sought to quash the order to reserve 80% ICU beds for COVID-19 patients, to file response to the Delhi government’s affidavit.

The High Court will hear the case on November 18.

Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain representing the government said there is a prediction that in the upcoming festive season, the number of COVID-19 cases will go up.

The affidavit contended that the petitioner association was looking to secure the financial interests of its member hospitals under the garb of expressing masked concerns over securing healthcare facilities for non-COVID-19 patients to be able to levy arbitrary and exorbitant medical treatment fee and other such charges from critical COVID-19 patients.

The Delhi government said several other States like Maharashtra and Odisha have also taken similar steps and put in place similar measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The government said when the emergency meeting was convened by it on September 12, out of 33 private hospitals, 25 participated in it and none of them raised any protest or objection to the decision of the authorities to reserve the ICU beds.

The government said the petition is an attempt to seriously imperil its pandemic management efforts and actually jeopardises the interests of hundreds of COVID-19 patients who have availed of the benefit of the order and secured ICU beds in private hospitals at capped rates.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/h7msc0/article32878854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE17-HOSPITAL2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-govt-defends-decision-on-bed-reservation-for-covid-19-patients/article32877152.ece
223,2020/10/17,Union bridges divide between contractual and regular workers,"70 contractual employees were formally inducted into the automobile workers’ union in Gurugram

In a first-of-its-kind initiative to bridge the divide between contractual and regular workers in Gurugram’s automotive sector Bellsonica Auto Components Employees Union on Thursday granted membership to the company’s contractual workers.

Around 70 contractual workers were formally inducted into the union with the handing over of membership slips at the culmination of the day-long hunger strike by the company’s workers against the four labour codes recently enforced, replacing the 44 labour laws and the long pending Charter of Demands (COD), among others.

Around 900 workers, supported by the automotive company unions, including Maruti, Satyam, Munjal, Suzuki and FMI, observed hunger strike outside the mini-secretariat. Satvir Singh, vice-president of Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Haryana unit, was also present.

Need to unite

The union’s vice-president Ajit Singh said that workers need to unite against the attacks of the ruling class and their decision to induct contractual workers into the union fold would lend more strength to their movement in this region.

He said the capitalists had divided the workers into regular and contractual to break their unity and exploit them. Mr. Singh said that COD of the Bellsonica workers was pending for more than 20 months now and the company management was using COVID-19 as a pretext to deny them their rightful share. He added that the union, among other things, had demanded that the strength of regular workers be increased.

Labour rights’ activist and lawyer Monu Kuhar said that legally contractual workers could be part of the union.

With gradual rise in pollution levels over the last few days in the National Capital Region, Gurugram residents have demanded that a ban on open burning of waste be strictly enforced to prevent situation from getting worse, especially in view of the pandemic.

The residents including volunteers of Citizens for Clean Air, a citizens’ collective, have been spotting and reporting waste burning at many open dumping sites as well as at small spots in and around neighbourhoods. They have been actively calling up their respective councillors as well as the administration to put a stop to this harmful practice.

The residents said given the pandemic situation and COVID-19 attacking the respiratory system, there is a need to stop local sources of pollution particles from entering their breathing zone.

Demanding that the administration and the government prioritise public health and stop waste burning, Ruchika Sethi, a member of Citizens for Clean Air, in a post on the Facebook page of the group wrote: “Despite many protests by the citizen’s collective, Citizens for Clean Air in 2016, 2017 and 2019; a signature campaign signed by 25,000 residents; several representations and meetings with the administration, MP Rao Inderjit Singh, Principal Secretary and a letter to the Chief Minister, none of the solutions for scientific Solid Waste Management have been implemented. Residents are now frustrated and unhappy with the lack of response. They say if the Government can impose such strict measures for the Covid 19 pandemic, surely it can stop a harmful practice like waste burning [sic].”

The group, in a tweet, said that challans and FIRs were not the solutions since waste burning was not sporadic, but a rampant practice. It said there was a need for a scientific de-centralised solid waste management mechanism to effectively deal with the menace.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/residents-demand-ban-on-open-waste-burning/article32877135.ece

The Mumbai Police has arrested a resident of Delhi for spreading fake news on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and his manager Disha Salian.

Vibhor Anand, claims to be an advocate in Bombay, was taken into custody by Cyber Crime cell. A highly placed source requesting anonymity said, “Mr. Anand has concocted several fake conspiracy theories in the death of Sushant and Disha. All the allegations on social media are sensational and defamatory and his twitter handle has been suspended.”

He said: “Mr. Anand claims to be an advocate practicing in Delhi. We are investigating all social media platforms. He is charged with sections 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 505 (2) (whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report), 500 (punishment for defamation) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and section 67 (punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act.”

A senior Delhi police officer said that Mumbai police on Thursday morning contacted Delhi police seeking custody of Mr. Anand. He was wanted in a case registered against him in Mumbai.

“A team of Delhi police assisted Mumbai police went to the house of Mr. Anand. He was taken to Mumbai on the same day by Mumbai police,” said the officer.

On August 4, Mr. Anand from his twitter handle – vibhor_anand tweeted, “Well Sooraj Pancholi, Arbaaz Khan, Showik Chakraborty (Rhea’s brother and Aditya Thackeray together Gangraped Disha Salian. The only person Mumbai Police is saving is Aditya, rest all are pawns...”

230,2020/10/17,"AQI improves in Delhi, neighbouring States","Rai asks DPCC to impose ₹1 cr. fine on North civic body for burning garbage

The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram, and Noida improved to the “poor” category on Friday from “very poor” a day earlier, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

The air quality is expected to improve in Delhi on Saturday and Sunday, said government-run monitoring agency SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research).

The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi was 239 and the values for Gurugram and Noida were 216 and 247 respectively, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin on Friday, which is an average of the past 24 hours. All the values are in the “orange” category and it can cause “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure”, said CPCB.

Marginal improvement in surface wind speed has led to improved ventilation and AQI in Delhi. “Low surface winds are expected on Friday and AQI is likely to stay in higher-end poor to the lower end of very poor for Saturday. Marginal improvement in surface winds is expected by 17th October and poor AQI is forecast. Air quality is forecast to further improve to lower end of poor category by 18th October,” SAFAR said.

The contribution of stubble burning to the PM2.5, a chief pollutant, is estimated to be around 18% in Delhi.

Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Friday said he has directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to impose a fine of ₹1 crore on the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) for inaction against garbage burning on a side of a main road in Kirari.

Mr. Rai said the situation of air pollution in Delhi is gradually getting serious, despite this, various agencies are not serious about strictly following the government guidelines.

“Today [Friday] during my inspection, I found garbage burning beside the main road of Baba Vidya Pati Marg. The garbage was burning from the morning, but the North MCD officials have not taken any action. Any such burning is completely prohibited in Delhi now. We will not tolerate such inaction, therefore, I have directed the DPCC to impose a penalty of ₹1 crore against the North civic body. The way we found the inaction of the civic body, which is unacceptable and that’s why the penalty should be imposed against it,” Mr. Rai said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/3m3h89/article32876876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL17-POLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aqi-improves-in-delhi-neighbouring-states/article32876880.ece
231,2020/10/17,DU closes admissions under first cut-off list,"49% of seats filled, admission for second list likely to begin on Monday: university

Delhi University on Friday closed the admissions to its merit-based undergraduate courses with nearly 49% of seats getting filled in the first list.

According to DU data, a total of 59,730 students applied under the first list — of which 34,814 aspirants paid the fees and completed the admission process.

Several colleges are likely to close admissions for courses like political science despite the cut-offs being high. Promila Kumar, principal of Gargi College, said: “As many as 1,600 admissions have taken place against 1,500 seats. The unreserved category in most courses will close with the first cut-off itself. A few of the reserved seats are left and the list will be opening up for those seats. Political science, economics, mathematics and BA (programme) are among the most popular courses in the college.”

At Ramjas College, 145 admissions have taken place for political science against 78 seats, said principal Manoj Khanna.

“As of Friday, there had been 409 admissions under the unreserved category and 500 under the reserved category,” said Ms. Khanna. Anju Srivastava, principal of Hindu college, said, “Around 900 admissions have taken place till Friday evening. Courses like physics, chemistry, political science and English are a few of the most sought-after ones. It is unlikely that we will open the lists for these courses in the second list.” At Miranda House, acting principal Bijayalakshmi Nanda, said seats for political science and geography have been filled for the unreserved category. Notably, admissions under the second list will begin on Monday.

DU has around 70,000 undergraduate seats. Due to the pandemic, the admission process has been entirely online this year and students were advised to not visit college campuses.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/du-closes-admissions-under-first-cut-off-list/article32876874.ece
232,2020/10/17,Amend DU Act to open more colleges: Kejriwal to Centre,"Over 1L students without resources; CM blames high cut-offs

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the city needs more colleges and universities, especially in the light of high cut-offs set by most Delhi University colleges for admissions this academic season.

He said he had written to Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal seeking the abolition of Section 5(2) of the Delhi University Act, 1922 so that new colleges and universities can be opened here.

The Act, made during the British era, states that a new college needs to be affiliated with Delhi University. This was amended in 1998 and allowed IP University to allow affiliation. Since then, IP University, which also has 127 affiliated colleges, has surpassed its capacity.

“There is a need to amend this Act further. Today I wrote a letter to Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and appealed to delete the section in order to facilitate opening new colleges in the city for students across the nation,” he said.

With cut-offs touching 100%, what will happen to students who secure less than 95%, he asked. “If we only talk about Delhi, every year 2.5 lakh students pass Class XII. However, only 1.25 lakh students can secure admission in Delhi colleges. If we talk numerically, it means two students are fighting for one seat, leading to cut-throat competition, leaving behind the other 1.25 lakh students without any resources. This means that colleges in Delhi can only accommodate 50% of students. Where will the other 50% go?” the CM asked.

“Students trying to get admission in colleges are facing trouble given the 100% cut-offs. High cut-offs are not the fault of students, it’s our fault — the Delhi government, previous governments and Central government. This is happening because of the lack of universities and colleges in Delhi in comparison to the ever-rising number of students. There is a stark imbalance in the ratio of the number of universities to the number of students,” he said.

‘Govt. ready to invest’

The Delhi government, he said, was ready to invest in these but there was a legal impediment. Delhi University already has 91 affiliated colleges and has not opened a new college in the last 30 years as it has already exceeded its capacity, he added.

“I am hopeful that the Central government will definitely ponder over this and will definitely alter this act to suit the need of the hour. I believe the stress factor is escalating in students because of this system,” he also said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/9ksylr/article32878823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16DU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/amend-du-act-to-open-more-colleges-kejriwal-to-centre/article32876871.ece
233,2020/10/17,Bandlaguda family crushed in house built with decade’s savings,"Five of a family, including two tots, were among the eight dead in boundary wall collapse

It is the ziyarat, third day of remembrance of those who lost their lives in the wall collapse in Ghouse Nagar, Bandlaguda. A few hours after Friday prayers, locals gather in a small, dark room. A hushed hum of ameen spoken into cupped hands resonates as the moulvi seeks forgiveness for the victims, and appeals to God that their souls reach the highest gardens of Paradise. Under a tent on the road, rice is being cooked for those who knew the family to partake of.

“It is for their isaal-e-sawaab (passing reward to the deceased),” says Mohammed Jahangir (60) who survived the devastating wall collapse on October 13. “We had dinner around 7.30 p.m. and half hour later, we went into our rooms. Just after 8 p.m., there was loud thunder. Within seconds, we realised what had happened. The wall collapsed and you know the rest. The neighbours came and pulled me out of the house and tried to save the others,” Mr Jahangir recalls.

His son, Samad Rabbani (35), died. He was the sole breadwinner, and the family was proud of his education — he was a graduate of the Jafaria Technical Institute, a private industrial training institute. Samad left for Saudi Arabia in search of a livelihood five years ago. Unsuccessful, he returned a year later. Samad and his wife Saba Hashmi (26) died as large granite blocks from the wall crashed into their room, through the tin sheet roof. Saba was four months pregnant.

“After his return, he drove my autorickshaw. He used to provide for the family. I am 24 and despite studying at Quli Qutub Shah Polytechnic, I could not find a job. On Tuesday night, water had started coming into the house, before the wall collapsed. It was dark. We did not know what had hit us. All of it happened in seconds,” said Mohammed Nawaz, Samad’s brother.

Samad’s sister, Fouzia Naaz, along with her four-year-old son Zain, and 19-day-old toddler, too were killed

The family had dreamed of owning a house for more than a decade. In 2016, that dream became a reality, and they moved to Ghouse Nagar. “We lived in Golconda earlier, in a rented house. After saving money for around 10 years, we bought this house,” Mr Nawaz says, before he returns to oversee the ziyarat rituals.

The family is now staying with Mr Jahangir’s cousin, who lives a few houses from his.

Another family, which lost three members — Zakira Begum (50), Syeda Anwari (4) and 16-month-old-Syed Sadiq — in the wall collapse, were moved to a relative’s house in Vatapally.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/yj5qr5/article32883551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18WALLCOLLAPSE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabad-family-crushed-in-house-built-with-decades-savings/article32883526.ece
234,2020/10/17,Three from Kolkata held for bank fraud,"One person taken into custody for job fraud

Three persons from Kolkata were arrested in connection with SIM swap fraud and one more from Delhi in a job fraud, Hyderabad Cyber Crime police said on Saturday.

In the SIM swap case, the accused, Sagar Mahato, Kumar Gaurav Singh and Sanjay Agarwal were arrested from West Bengal and brought to Hyderabad on transit warrant.

Similarly Sachin Yadav, who is involved in a job fraud, was arrested in Delhi and brought to the city on transit warrant.

Modus operandi

All the four accused were remanded for judicial custody on Saturday, Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said.

He said that in September last year, a person approached police stating that he had three overdraft accounts with DCB Bank for his business activities and all the accounts are registered with his yahoo mail ID and his mobile numbers. “He got OTPs on his mail ID and his mobile numbers as well for the three accounts. On September 4, after checking his bank details, he was surprised to know that a total amount of ₹35,89,899 was fraudulently transferred into some unknown accounts through IMPS, RTGS, NEFT from his three accounts, and his registered mobile number was disconnected a few months ago,” he said.

When the victim accessed internet banking, he came to know that five beneficiary accounts were added into his three accounts without his knowledge and consent. Based on his complaint, a case was registered and the three accused were identified and arrested. Police seized 7 MM pistol with two magazines and six live rounds, seven mobile phones and three bank cards.

Mr. Mohanty said that the accused were also involved in another case in Cyber Crime police station where the complainant lost ₹50 lakh. Sagar Mahato is also involved in a recent case of Mumbai Cyber Crimes where the amount of fraud was ₹2 crore.

Businessman cheated

In the other case, a city-based man was cheated to a tune of ₹96,563. The victim told police that when he was searching for a job, an unknown person contacted him on behalf of naukri.com and offered him a job. Further, he was lured to transfer the amount through his wallet. “After transferring the money, he found the mobile numbers were switched off and he was cheated,” the officer said.

According to Mr. Mohanty, the accused Sachin Yadav and his associates have been cheating the job seekers by contacting them over mobile phones and emails.

Appeal to people

“The accused gets the information of unemployed persons and offers them a job and collects money through wallets. After collecting money, they would switch off their mobile phones and change them frequently,” he said. The investigators seized one laptop, eight mobile phones, two routers, two bank cards and six SIM cards. The officer urged the general public not to believe such type of job offers and do not proceed with the payment as genuine companies would never collect money to provide jobs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/j2ozr0/article32883498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy18Mohanti,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/three-from-kolkata-held-for-bank-fraud/article32883499.ece

236,2020/10/17,Choose course and college wisely: NIT Warangal director,"Engineering admission counselling on; students told not to make hasty decisions in choosing course and college

In the midst of counselling for engineering courses and colleges, students and parents are in a dilemma on choosing from the myriad courses and nearly a lakh of seats in 15-odd popular disciplines.

Senior professors caution students not to make hasty decisions in choosing the course and the college based on peer’s advise but going through a serious exercise including visiting the college, understanding the faculty quality, research facilities and reputation of the college management.

Students will not be joining for just a degree but to acquire the life-long learning process in a changed world, feels N.V. Ramana Rao, Director, National Institute of Technology (NIT) Warangal. How best the colleges are equipped to instil the skills to learn and adapt to the changes is important than mere placements or buildings.

Prof. Rao advises students and parents to check where the faculty have obtained their higher degrees from. The Ph.Ds obtained from national and international institutions are likely to instil a different experience among teachers and students can be assured of such experience passed onto them. A good teacher produces better graduates is his argument.

It’s natural that good colleges hire good teachers as they are willing to pay them well. So a teacher is the important component of the engineering wheel. The research activities of teachers are an important element while judging the teachers. “What kind of projects they handle and for which companies they consult for reflect their calibre.”

The second important aspect is the infrastructure. Laboratories, equipment, connectivity and their availability to students are important. Check what kind of e-journals do the libraries subscribe to and also what student events like seminars, workshops, festivals including sports activities. “They all contribute in making a good graduate.”

NIRF rankings

The best way to judge these facilities is to personally visit the colleges, speak to the senior students and interact with the faculty before finalising the college. However, the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings provide a positive overview of the quality of colleges.

Prof. Rao reminds that the NIRF rankings approved by the Ministry of Education draw from the overall recommendations from the parameters covering “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”. So these rankings give a clear idea about the quality of the technical institution.

Which branch?

Another question that haunts students is which branch to choose? Prof. Rao, who earlier worked as JNTU-H Registrar, says the answer is all branches have equal employment opportunities. “But before choosing a branch, one has to assess himself with questions like what are his intellectual and physical abilities to study that particular branch, competencies and skill sets required.”

In fact, all branches of Engineering have good potential for career prospects, employment and entrepreneurship. So passion for a particular area of study comes into play. Companies don’t look at the scores alone but lot of emerging skill sets apart from interpersonal and language skills.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/7jcb9r/article32883477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy16Ramana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/choose-course-and-college-wisely-nit-warangal-director/article32883476.ece
237,2020/10/17,KCR to launch Dharani portal on Oct. 25,"A trend-setter for the country for registration of non-agriculture properties: CS

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao will launch the Dharani portal on October 25 that would be a trend-setter for the country for registration of non-agriculture properties, Chief Secretary to the State government Somesh Kumar stated here on Saturday.

In a video conference held with District Collectors, Additional Collectors, Tahsildars and Naib (Deputy) Tahsildars, he made a detailed presentation about the functioning of the new portal. He stated, “Dharani is the most innovative, state-of-the-art, transparent, accountable, safe, secure hassle-free and discretion-less portal. It is revolutionary and will be a trend-setter for the entire country.”

As per the vision of the Chief Minister, the system would ensure absolute transparency and remove discretion. Under the system, Tahsildars of all the 570 mandals would function as Joint Sub-Registrars, while the Sub-Registrar Officers would do registrations of non-agriculture properties from 142 locations, Mr. Somesh Kumar explained.

The Chief Secretary asked the Collectors to ensure 100% preparedness in terms of staff and infrastructure for Dharani portal. He also stressed that all Tahsildars should undertake at least 10 transactions by Sunday. He instructed the Collectors to ensure that hardware facilities for Dharani were fully functional.

Further, he suggested the District Collectors to hold regular coordination meetings with engineers of power distribution companies (Discoms), broadband service providers and Telangana State Technological Services (TSTS) representatives to ensure that there was no interruption to Dharani services. The Tahsildars should rise to the occasion and be ready to implement the new system – Dharani portal, he noted.

239,2020/10/17,Revanth barred from visiting submerged pump house,"Explosions for Palamuru-RR project work led to the submergence: Uttam

Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy along with AICC Secretary Sampath Kumar and former MP Mallu Ravi were arrested while they were on their way to visit the submerged pump house of Kalwakurthy LIP at Yellur village on Saturday.

Tension prevailed as the Congress leaders were stopped near Telakapalli stating there was no permission even as the leaders argued under what rules they were being prevented. As Congress cadres swelled up protesting against the refusal to allow the visit, police tried to arrest the leaders.

Mr. Revanth Reddy sustained injuries on the shin of both the legs as police tried to forcibly take him into custody. They were shifted to Talakapalli police station in Nagarkurnool district.

Speaking at the police station, Mr. Reddy alleged that the submergence was reflection of the corruption and deliberate ignorance of safety practices and blamed CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao for it.

He demanded that only an inquiry by sitting judge of the High Court can bring out the negligence of the State government, given the magnanimity of the loss and the favours extended to some contractors. “Any inquiry by government officials will be an eyewash,” he added.

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said at a press conference that an expert committee, constituted by the present government, had submitted a report on June 20, 2016, making several recommendations for the safety of the pump house.

However, the State government ignored the recommendations and carried out underground works of Palamuru Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Project within 400-metre radius of KLIP pump house.

He said those explosions led to the submergence of the pump house inundating 10 out of its 14 floors within 20 minutes.

He claimed that the incident, resulting in loss of property worth thousands of crores, was a man-made mistake. He said the CM should accept the responsibility for the entire damage as he also holds the Irrigation portfolio.

The TPCC chief alleged that the irrigation projects in Telangana were filling the pockets of TRS leaders with cash from the commission they were getting from the contractors. He alleged that sub-standard and inferior quality works were done in Kaleshwaram, Mid Maniar and Kondapochamma projects and they were getting affected.

TPCC working president Ponnam Prabhakar demanded the intervention of the Central government to probe into the quality of works in the irrigation projects constructed by the TRS regime.

240,2020/10/17,"Kalwakurthy pump house flooding may hit irrigation, drinking water needs","It serves an ayacut of 3.65 lakh acres across 24 mandals, meets drinking water needs of 336 villages

The flooding of the pump house (first lift) of Mahatma Gandhi Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Project (LIP) at Yellur village of Nagarkurnool district on Friday evening is likely to have a huge impact on farmers and people depending on its water for irrigation and drinking water needs.

Water lifted from the foreshores of Srisailam reservoir with the help of three lifts serves an ayacut of 3.65 lakh acres spread across 24 mandals of Nagarkurnool, Wanaparthy, Mahabubnagar and Rangareddy districts, besides meeting the drinking water needs of 336 villages in Kollapur, Nagarkurnool, Achampet, Wanaparthy, Kalwakurthy and Jadcherla constituencies.

“The impact of flooding of the pump house could be huge and it is going to be very difficult to resume pumping water from the facility in the immediate months as de-watering, and pumping out of flood water, is expected to take at least 25 days,” a source in the Irrigation department told The Hindu on Saturday.

According to the engineers, the pump house has five motors with capacity of 30 megawatt each to discharge 800 cusecs of water each after lifting to a height of 95 metres. Although several theories are making rounds on the immediate cause of flooding of the pump house, the engineers concerned have refused to point out at anything until they examine the entire facility physically to come to any conclusion.

Asked whether the underground blasting work being done for the pump house of Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Project nearby could be the cause, a senior engineer said, “There are so many possibilities including huge flood continuing for a long period this year and there could be some kind of mechanical failure too that could have failed to prevent flood water breaking the barriers of surge pool and inundating the pump house. Unless we see the ground zero physically we can’t pinpoint any of the reasons.”

The source, however, admitted that the question of giving water to the ayacut for the remaining season is a distant possibility as de-watering of the pump house itself was expected to take a long time. “The water already pumped and stored in the four balancing reservoirs could, at best, be given to the ayacut to serve the needs of standing crops but it could hardly last for 7 to 10 days,” he explained.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cv2k26/article32885228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18KALWAKURTHYPROJECT3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kalwakurthy-pump-house-flooding-may-hit-irrigation-drinking-water-needs/article32883372.ece
241,2020/10/17,Proposal for five new lifts on SRSP-FFC submitted,"A proposal (report) on the five lift schemes being planned on Sriramsagar Flood Flow Canal (FFC) was submitted to the State government on Saturday after discussing it in detail at a meeting held here.

Vice-chairman of Telangana State Planning Board B. Vinod Kumar, Vemulawada legislator Chennamaneni Ramesh, Engineer-in-Chief (Projects-Karimnagar) G. Anil Kumar and others participated in the meeting. The report was submitted to ENC (Irrigation) C. Muralidhar later in the day.

Explaining the proposal with the help of a PPP, Mr. Anil Kumar said it would have five lift schemes in Vemulawada, Korutla, Jagitial and Choppadandi constituencies along with pump houses by drawing water from the SRSP-FFC.

Water would be first lifted from FFC to Suramma (Rudrangi) minor irrigation tank. From Suramma tank, it is proposed to irrigate about 70,000 acres ayacut in several villages under the right and left canals from it. Besides, pump houses are planned at several locations, including at Lakkakula Cheruvu and Kotha Cheruvu.

Water in Suramma tank could also be used for stabilising the 60,000 acres of existing ayacut and could be given to Chandurthi and Mothkuraopet tanks to assure irrigation under them, the ENC explained.

Mr. Vinod said the new proposals would also seek to provide irrigation and drinking water facility to drought-prone Kathlapur and Medipally mandals from where people migrate to Gulf countries in search of better livelihoods. He complimented the engineers of the irrigation department for conducting field surveys for the last two months to enable preparation of the report.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/proposal-for-five-new-lifts-on-srsp-ffc-submitted/article32883356.ece

244,2020/10/17,Hyderabad floods | Police personnel turn real heroes,"Going beyond the call of duty, they worked in the swirling waters to guide people and rescued many from being swept away

With walkie-talkie sets firmly gripped on one hand and clad in khaki raincoats, the police of three urban commissionerates — Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda, were seen wading through the swirling waters extending helping hands to the public when it rained cats and dogs in the city.

The city police have earned rare encomiums from the stranded public across various localities vulnerable to floods in the city in the last three days. When several localities, including Raj Bhavan road, LB Nagar, Tolichowki and parts of IT Sector have virtually turned into canals, the gushing waters pushed aside cars, bikes, and other vehicles. It was the police personnel on duty who reached out to the hapless commuters and averted loss of lives.

The Chikkadpally locality, which is one of the worst affected due to flood, had a saviour policeman who single handedly is credited to have rescued 25 people from being washed away. Police Constable Veerender rescued 25 stranded people while himself remaining in deep water at Aravind Nagar, Domalguda. “He is my hero. Such officers are the true stars of our team. I salute them and thank the community for encouraging the Hyderabad police,” Tweeted Hyderabad City Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar.

Prakash, a young man, who got swept away in the Chinnacheruvu near Ghatkesar, which recorded the highest rainfall of 32.4 cm, was rescued by the Rachkonda police. They also rescued two persons who washed away along with their bikes at Gowrelly village.

The efforts of constable Surender of Abdullapurmet police station was well appreciated on social media after he recovered the body of a missing person by sitting on a poclainer. Police said that the victim, who was later identified as Raghavendra from Bachupally village in Kandakur mandal, went missing on Monday night. “Telangana Police are going beyond their call of duty to serve citizens.... Kudos to Sri Surender, Police Constable Officer from Abdullapurmet PS,” Tweeted Additional Director General of Police (Women Safety Wing) Swati Lakra.

The East Zone police of Hyderabad distributed clothes and food door-to-door to people affected in Moosa Nagar and other areas. The police of three commissionerates have put their training in disaster management and rose to the occasion. The city has witnessed disruption to traffic due to tree falls, water blocking, twisted eclectic poles and stranded vehicles on the roads. It was a well-coordinated effort with other stakeholders that had seen a seamless return to normalcy even before the ominous rains receded.

No sooner did the announcement of intending rains come than the police in a well-calibrated effort got the temporary houses that cropped up on the bank of River Musi vacated. As the River Musi started swelling, people heaved a sigh of relief and said, ‘Thank God, we are saved.’ Even the top police officials were also seen as frontline warriors in saving and securing the lives of the people engulfed in waters. And at the same time, they were also issuing orders to the police on the ground as and when they got leaks of disaster mitigation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1aeq79/article32877281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16KRAFLOODS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabad-floods-police-personnel-turn-real-heroes/article32877273.ece

247,2020/10/17,222 transformers yet to be charged,"Transformers not charged due to flood water levels

Chairman and Managing Director of Souther Power Distribution Company of Telangana Ltd (TSSPDCL) G. Raghuma Reddy on Friday visited several flood affected areas in GHMC and inspected the damage to transmission and distribution network during the heavy rain and flooding earlier this week.

Along with the senior officials (engineers) of the power utility, Mr. Raghuma Reddy visited Saroornagar, Asmangarh and Charminar divisions. He stated that localities such as Singereni Colony, Gowtam Nagar, Sharada Nagar, Kamala Nagar, Kodandarama Nagar, P&T Colony, Barkas, Maisaram, Chandrayangutta, Al Zubair Colony, Falaknuma, Indra Nagar, Jamal Nagar and Salala areas were still in 2-3 feet deep flood water.

He explained that 13 distribution transformers were not charged due to flood water levels in Saroornagar division and 28 in Charminar division.

A total of 222 distribution transformers in various areas of Greater Hyderabad were not charged yet due to flood water levels in apartment cellars and streets for safety reasons. As a result, the residents in the areas served by them were still denied of power supply.

The CMD instructed the field officers to examine the surroundings on charging the distribution transformers and complimented them for their continuous efforts in restoration of power supply. Director (Projects) T. Srinivas, Superintending Engineers Khaja Abdul Rahaman qnd B. Ravi, Divisional Engineers Suresh, J. Srinivas, Anwar Pasha and other officers too accompanied the CMD in his visit.

Meanwhile, the authorities of power utilities stated that a total of over 400 distribution transformers were washed away in the flood waters across the State this week and over 1,000 electrical poles were either uprooted or damaged due to tree fall and other reasons. Insulation of critical joints was also damaged during the rains and except for safety reasons in localities where there is water-logging power supply was restored to all affected areas in the State.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/222-transformers-yet-to-be-charged/article32876976.ece
248,2020/10/17,"2 months after SLBHES mishap, Genco gears up to restart units","The first two units are expected to generate power at the end of this flood season

After experiencing difficulties in soot removal and muck cleaning from the Srisailam Left Bank Hydro Electric Station (SLBHES), which witnessed a major fire on August 20 night, the authorities of Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TS-Genco) are getting ready to restart the first two units in a week’s time.

“If everything goes according to plan, the first two units of the 6×150 megawatt underground hydro-electric station will resume power generation in about a week’s time – the fag end of the flood season to Srisailam. All the major repair or restoration works pertaining to panel board, power supply back-up, lighting and air-conditioning system and restoration of the gas-insulated sub-station in the tunnel have been completed for the revival of the two units and the final checks are going on,” a top executive of the power utility said on Friday.

But for the long delay in soot removal and cleaning exercise, the two units would have been pressed into generation last month itself – during the thick of flood season, the official said admitting the fact that the mishap had caused major financial loss in terms of damage to the power plant as also loss of the low-cost power generation.

“During the July-October period, which is considered the peak flood season, power generation at Srisailam LBHES this year was only 648 million units (MU) as against 1,386 MU last year, with barely one week of generation possible for the period this year, if everything goes well in restarting the first two units,” the official said explaining the loss to the utility in terms of low-cost power generation.

Since the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system in Srisailam LBHES is 20 years old, the Genco authorities have also replaced it now, although they were planning for it before the fire mishap itself. The Genco officials further stated that three more units, except unit number four, would be revived over the next three months and the remaining one unit before the commencement of the next flood season.

The sources said they had also weighed the option of replacing all the units but ruled that out to be unwise from the point of economics of working and the condition of the generation units after the fire mishap.

The internal committee that was tasked to probe the fire and recommend measures to prevent recurrence of such mishaps in future is yet to complete its work, the sources said, adding that the team would visit the project one more time next week before finalising its report.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/u6xp99/article32876934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16SRISAILAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2-months-after-slbhes-mishap-genco-gears-up-to-restart-units/article32876929.ece

Telangana recorded 1,554 new novel coronavirus (COVID-19) positive cases on Thursday, taking the total number of positive cases to 2,19,224. Seven persons succumbed to the virus, taking the total number of casualties to 1,256. The total number of active cases as on Thursday was 23,203 with 19,251 persons under home/institutional quarantine. The sudden dip in the cases was expected to be on account of decline in the number of samples tested, which was pegged at 43,916 much lower than the-more-than 52,000 every day till the end of October first week.

Reports of 831 of the 46,657 samples tested were awaited and the total number of samples tested to date reached 37,46,963. Of the total samples tested during the day, 41,968 were in the government institutions and 2,218 in private medical establishments.

The case fatality rate continued to be much lower at 0.57 per cent against the national average of 1.5 per cent.

The number of recoveries continued to be on par or higher than the positive cases with 1,435 persons recovering from the impact of the virus on Thursday taking the total number of recovered persons to 1,94,653, inching closer to the two lakh mark. Recovery rate climbed up to 88.79 per cent as against the national average of 87.5 per cent.

250,2020/10/17,YouTube channel Hopead TV’s digital classical concerts connect artistes and rasikas,"Hope Advertising agency’s studio set-up lends cultural organisations its infrastructure and technical expertise for digital concerts

The stage is set for a veena concert at Hope Advertising private limited office in Lakdikapul, Hyderabad. Veena player Subhashini Sastry, accompanied by Peravali Jaya Bhasker on mridangam and B Janardhan on ghatam, takes centre stage. Ananda Mohan Voruganti who organised the show and is a founder of city-based Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram cultural organisation introduces the artistes virtually. A few minutes later, the multi-camera livestreams classical music on the YouTube channel HopeadTV.

How it started

HopeadTV was launched last year to make videos and create content for social change, informs Hope Advertising agency’s managing director KS Rao. Driven by Rao’s interest in music, the channel collaborated with the cultural organisation Sujanaranjani to stream recorded renditions of Annamayya and Ramadasu kirtanas by young singers. These classical renditions were interspersed with an explanation of the gist of each song by Sujanaranani’s founder Mahidhara Seeta Rama Sarma. “Since the office included multi-cameras, studio lights and video mixer (used for their ad films), the singers used to come to the office and shoot,” recalls Sarma.

During the pandemic, the channel came to the rescue of cultural organisations which do not have the infrastructure and technical support to host digital concerts. “We had to close in the initial lockdown months and shoots resumed since June; only four artistes and three staff members, to operate the equipment, were allowed,” informs Rao. The events were initially free but now the company collects ₹10,000 (includes GST) to shoot and live stream the two-hour event. He says, “Besides four cameras, mixer and console system, we use the high internet leased line to shoot and stream the events. When videos are shot through a mobile phone, the audio is sometimes jarring; the phone picks up voices of people at a distance. So we charge a small fee towards the maintenance of equipment and to pay conveyance to our employees who are putting on extra work for these videos.”

Cultural organisations like Sampradaya, Vignana Samithi, Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram, Silicon Andhra, Sanskriti Foundation, South Indian Cultural Association, Hari Hara Kshetram and Swara Vahini Cultural Trust have been using the channel’s services and hosting monthly concerts. Since June, the channel has made 64 videos and streamed more than 24 live shows on its YouTube channel and Facebook.

Going digital is the way forward for Carnatic music, observes Seeta Rama Sarma: “Digital performance has widened the performer and audience reach. Musicians are exploring the medium and changing with the times to reach audiences across the globe,” he says.

Passionate about classical music, 85year-old Anand Mohan calls the channel a god-given gift. “For someone who used to organise concerts with pension money, hosting a digital concert with that studio set-up is next to impossible. I do not have that kind of money, to buy the equipment,” he says. The octogenarian hopes to hold the 500th concert of Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram by December. He adds, “I curate the show and give directions to artistes over the phone. I give my feedback on a trial recording sent through WhatsApp. The streaming begins with my introduction of the performers.”

N Rajasekhar of South Indian Cultural Organisation (SICA) says, “This pandemic period has made a big difference to cultural organisations especially those serving classical music. Digital concerts are beneficial not only in entertaining the rasikas (cultural connoisseurs) but also provide some employment to artistes who are solely dependent on music.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/sz0uuv/article32879869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym10hopetv,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/hope-advertising-agencys-studio-set-up-lends-cultural-organisations-its-infrastructure-and-technical-expertise-for-digital-concerts/article32879873.ece

257,2020/10/17,Turban case: DGP meets family members; Governor demands immediate release of Balwinder Singh,"The family members of Balwinder Singh, who has been arrested by West Bengal police for carrying a firearm at a rally organised by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), met senior police officials late on Friday evening.

After the meeting, family members including Mr. Singh’s wife, Karamjit Kaur, said they have been assured that cases against her husband would be withdrawn. Mr. Singh is in the custody of Howrah police and the development indicates that the standoff between the government and the family may ease out.

Earlier, the family had threatened to sit on hunger strike outside the State Secretariat. Mr. Singh was arrested on October 8, during the BJP march to the State Secretariat. During the scuffle with the police his turban came off, triggering a controversy. Several BJP leaders had said that the incident has hurt sentiments of people of Sikh community. Mr. Singh, a private security guard, was hired by a local BJP leader. His family has said that the weapon he was carrying had a firearm which had a license.

Meanwhile, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar asked the State government to “immediately release” Balwinder Singh and withdraw cases against him.

“A delegation of Ex Servicemen Veterans called on me seeking immediate release, withdrawal of case #BalwinderSingh.

258,2020/10/17,Durga Puja committee to install giant TV screens to help people watch decorations and idols,"Organisers say there will be livestreaming of the puja and rituals on Facebook live, YouTube

A big-budget Durga Puja committee in the city will adorn the idols of Goddess Durga and her progeny with 25 kg gold and to avoid crowding inside the pandal would install giant TV screens on roads so people can watch the decoration and the idol.

The idols of Sribhumi Sporting Club will be wearing golden crown, golden chain and the golden jewellery, State Fire minister Sujit Bose, told PTI.

Mr Basu said while the puja will shun its usual lustre due to the COVID-19 situation, there will be no scaling down of the idol’s height and its look.

“We will ensure visitors do not crowd inside the pandal and will control the crowd in case there is the hint of gathering. We will ask them to see the pandal and protima (idol) on the giant TV screens put up near the marquee on the side of VIP Road if there is a chance of swelling of crowd at any moment,” the senior Trinamool Congress leader said.

He said the pandal will look like the famous Kedarnath temple.

The Kashi Bose Lane Durga Puja committee, which has modelled its pandal as a giant urn and put up the idol on an elevated platform inside for restricted entry of visitors or roadside view, will also stream every moment of the celebrations through Facebook live and the website of the puja committee in 360 angle.

“We will provide YouTube links from where the proceedings can be viewed,” puja committee General Secretary Somen Dutta said.

The Santosh Mitra Square Puja Committee, which has altogether banned the entry of people outside the locality to the puja pandal, will also live stream different rituals including ‘pushpanjali’ (offering flowers to the goddess), sandhipujo on YouTube, Facebook live, puja committee spokesman Sajal Ghosh said.

“We will also show images of the pandal, the interiors and the deity to make those left out not to miss the ambience altogether,” Ghosh said.

The Jodhpur Park 95 Pally will have several trucks fitted with giant screen LED TV that will move around the city and will beam the different moments of the puja.

“While people will be allowed to go inside the pandal, we want to avoid the crowd at any cost,” Ratan Dey, President of the committee and member board of administrators Kolkata Municipal Corporation said.

To enable those not wishing to visit pandals, Bhawanipur 75 Palli will also livestream the moments at the puja pandal on Facebook and the rituals, committee Secretary Subir Das said.

“While due to spaced out timing our idol themed on Maa can be seen physically from October 18, if anyone is afraid to be in the crowd, he/she will be able to view and appreciate the same on virtual media as well,” Das said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/miivgw/article32879428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PUJAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/durga-puja-committee-to-install-giant-tv-screens-to-help-people-watch-decorations-and-idols/article32879429.ece

The Vandiyur tank, one of the largest tanks in the city, is a sight to behold. Following the recent rain and release of water from Periyar Main Canal, the tank is filled up to 90% of its total capacity.

M. Pavazhakannan, Executive Engineer, Periyar Main Canal, Melur Division, said that 25 recharge wells were constructed inside the tank last year and the inlet channels of the tank were also desilted. Bund strengthening works were also undertaken.

“All these steps ensured that rainwater was effectively stored in the tank. The water released in Periyar Main Canal for irrigation is also sometimes released into the tank,” he added.

The DHAN Foundation, in association with HCL Foundation, has taken up a project to revive the Vandiyur tank.

N.Venkatesan, Programme Leader, DHAN Vayalagam Tank Foundation, said that Prosopis Juliflora was removed from the Vandiyur and its chain of tanks as part of the revival programme. ""In the 9th branch of the Periyar Main Canal, which releases water to Vandiyur tank, garbage was cleared and it was completely desilted,"" he said.

D. Raghavan, President of Gomathipuram - Thendral Nagar Residents' Welfare Association, said that storage of water in the tank will help to increase the groundwater table in the neighbouring areas.

""Water was stored in the tank for many months last year. As a result, the residents of Gomathipuram spent very less money on purchasing water from private water tankers,"" he said.

In addition, the tank is an important biodiversity spot which attracts many birds, said Madurai-based ornithologist T. Badri Narayanan, who is an ophthalmologist by profession.

266,2020/10/17,HC deplores back-door approach,"Madurai

The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has deprecated the practice of litigants trying to restore lapsed cause of action by sending representations to the authorities and thereafter filing writ petitions before the court seeking a direction to authorities to consider the representation. It has become a recent trend, the court said.

Justice S.M. Subramaniam observed that the modus operandi of the litigants, with the assistance of the legal brain, involved sending representations to the authorities, immediately followed by filing a writ petition, with a prayer to consider the representation.

The court, which was hearing a petition where a representation was sent after a lapse of 19 years, observed that in such cases it would be difficult for the authorities even to trace service particulars of the writ petitioner. The litigants are attempting to re-adjudicate the issues which were settled long back. This back-door approach cannot be encouraged, the judge said.

All persons, including government employees, are expected to redress their grievances within a reasonable period of time from the date of arising of cause of action. Once an aggrieved person allows the cause of action to lapse, the court will not entertain any writ petition thereafter. Mere submission of representation after a number of years would not provide any cause of action for the aggrieved to file a writ of mandamus, the judge said.

Such writ proceedings filed with an intention to achieve the goal in an indirect manner by illegal or irregular means can never be encouraged and entertained. All such litigations are to be rejected with heavy costs. The High Court being the temple of justice must ensure that speedy justice is provided to the needy and those who approach the court with clean hands by establishing their legal rights, the court said.

The court dismissed the writ petition filed by A. Kasthuribai from Dindigul, a Hand Weaving Instructor who retired in 1992. She approached the court in 2011 seeking a direction to authorities to revise her pension benefits.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-deplores-back-door-approach/article32882162.ece
267,2020/10/17,AIADMK functionary springs a surprise by helpful gesture,"Helps the wife of a deceased party man by giving a cheque for ₹1.70 lakh

The AIADMK functionaries would often proudly and confidently say that even an unknown cadre could reach the top position in their party which would never let them down if the cadre is loyal to it.

When party supremo and the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa hand-picked lesser known faces of the party for prime positions such as Rajya Sabha MP, the cadres’ loyalty and trust in the high command became unassailable.

It was reaffirmed once again when the AIADMK celebrated its 49th Foundation Day here on Saturday. After garlanding the statue of party founder and the late Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran at Kokkirakulam along with the cadre, the party’s Tirunelveli district secretary, Thatchai N. Ganesa Raja, handed over 1,000 sweet boxes to the cadre and the public in the party office amid bursting of crackers.

Just when the party functionaries thought that the celebrations were over, Mr. Ganesa Raja invited an aged frail-looking woman waiting there to come closer to him. As the crowds gave way for the woman, Mr. Ganesa Raja handed over a cheque for ₹1.70 lakh to her and asked her to pay the money to the bank on Monday positively to get back the documents of her mortgaged house.

Only after it was handed over, the party functionaries came to know that the woman was widow Avudaiyammal, wife of AIADMK’s secretary of Karaiyiruppu area, the late Jadaamuni. Even before he could repay the loan, he had availed from the bank by mortgaging his house, Jadaamuni passed away, leaving the family in the lurch.

On coming to know about the predicament of the poor family, Mr. Ganesa Raja got the loan details and handed over the assistance.

He also gave ₹50,000 to the family of a party functionary, the late Samsudeen of Pettai, towards marriage assistance for his daughters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/7l3vqe/article32882154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18MATVL-ADMK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/aiadmk-functionary-springs-a-surprise-by-helpful-gesture/article32882155.ece

269,2020/10/17,62 students qualify in NEET,"Shortcomings of government-sponsored NEET coaching stressed

Madurai

Out of the 226 government and government-aided school students of Madurai district, who attended the government-sponsored online crash course for National-Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) during the COVID-19 pandemic, a total of 62 students qualified in the examination.

With only 27.43% of the government and aided school students who attended the online crash course being qualified in the examination, teachers and experts stress on the shortcomings of the government-sponsored NEET coaching.

According to officials from the School Education department in the last academic year around 400 Class 12 students in the district, showed interest in taking the state-sponsored weekly NEET coaching classes that were held in 15 centres across the district.

Usually, the government arranges a residential NEET coaching for the students one month prior to the examination.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic robbed the government students of this opportunity. So, the school education department collaborated with a private company for an online NEET coaching crash course that commenced in mid-June.

S. Vennila Devi, the district coordinator of government-sponsored NEET coaching, said that the COVID-19 pandemic made it difficult to track down all the students and hence only 226 students were enrolled for the online coaching course.

District Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan said that the lower performance of the students can be attributed to the restriction in meeting the teachers in person and clarifying their doubts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Concurring with this viewpoint, N.D. Keren Luxia Mai, a student of Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Othakkadai who scored 320 in the NEET, said that the online classes were out of reach for many government school students.

""Many of my friends did not have smartphones at their homes and hence they couldn't attend the online classes. Many of the students also faced difficulties in understanding classes that were held in English,"" she said.

Mr. Swaminathan said that the government recharged data packs for around 45 government students who faced difficulty in attending the online classes.

The coaching provided during the online classes were more advanced when compared to the sessions that were held weekly before the pandemic, said Ms. Mai. ""The students were able to write mock NEET tests only during the online sessions. It would be better if intense training is provided right from the beginning of the year,"" she said.

Ms. Vennila Devi said that out of the 15 NEET coaching centres in the district, only around 10 of them had smart classes. ""It is essential that all centres have advanced infrastructural facilities to coach NEET aspirants,"" she said.

A source from the education department said that teachers were deputed on a rotation basis for teaching in the weekly coaching classes. ""A team of dedicated teachers must be formed to train the students throughout the year,"" said Ms. Vennila Devi.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/62-students-qualify-in-neet/article32881793.ece

271,2020/10/17,‘Call drop’ and poor data speed irk BSNL customers,"They are attributed to poor quality of signal, software and hardware issues

Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited is yet to provide ‘call drop-free’ communication, subscribers say. Though the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) slaps fine on telecom firms for ‘call drops,’ BSNL subscribers continue to experience this problem.

After complaints of ‘call drop’ exerted pressure on BSNL officials here, a technical team was recently deployed to assess quality of mobile phone signal in Tuckerammalpuram, Government Engineering College area, NGO A, B and C Colony, Tirumal Nagar, Reddiyarpatti and adjoining areas. As the team found that poor quality of signal was the reason behind the ‘call drop’ and other associated issues, upgrading of software and installation of hardware were done in the transmission towers, a source said.

4G service

An official admitted that they had not been given permission for 4G service. “What our people are giving in a few places of Kanniyakumari district following pressure exerted by a few MLAs is not 4G service. It’s only an intermediate service between 3G and 4G. If this situation continues, the subscribers will get attracted by private players, who are being given NoCs by the Centre instantly,” said Soosai Maria Antony of Tirunelveli district president of BSNL Employees’ Union.

When power supply got disrupted on Saturday in the southern parts of Palayamkottai and suburbs in the wake of monthly maintenance work taken up in the Melapalayam substation, BSNL’s mobile phone communication was almost crippled with a lot of call drops and other related issues.

“I can’t even download a 4.40 MB-size 22-second video file sent by a client with the BSNL connection which showed reception of only 2G signal most of the time. When I switched over to a private operator’s data after my repeated attempts with BSNL data, I could do it in no time,” said N. Ramasubramanian, an engineer from NGO Colony.

A BSNL official said private operators could keep their transmission gadgets running with diesel generators during scheduled or unscheduled power cuts while the BSNL could not do so. “Owing to mounting arrears for purchase of diesel, the dealer has stopped diesel supply. Only a very few transmission towers were functioning on Saturday with diesel generators and hence the problem,” he revealed.

The Telecom District Manager, who joined recently after being transferred from Thoothukudi district, could not be reached for his comments.

Saji Kumar, Principal General Manager, BSNL, Nagercoil, said 3G data coverage had increased in Tirunelveli Town area by adding 4th sector of 3G data in 26 sites. “As data usage has increased during the pandemic, customers are experiencing slow speed. For 4G expansion, the process of awarding tenders was on which will take some time,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/call-drop-and-poor-data-speed-irk-bsnl-customers/article32881618.ece

Nothing went right for the cargo autorickshaw driver S. Raja Mohammed (29) on his reported maiden attempt to snatch gold chain near Melur on Friday.

First, he chose a head constable to snatch the gold chain. Secondly, the anxious bike rider lost his mobile phone in his attempt to pull the chain. To add to his misery, he lost control of the two-wheeler and dashed against another vehicle only to be caught by the public.

Raja Mohammed of Kidaripatti followed T. Vidhya, 42, head constable, attached to District Crime Branch in Sivaganga district while she was returning home at N. Perumalpatti near Melur.

When she came near Ganapathipuram, the man managed to yank her six sovereign gold chain. The man did not know that he had targeted a police personnel as she was in her civvies. She raised an alarm. It made the thief anxious. His mobile phone fell down. He hardly crossed some 100 metres, his motorbike dashed against a vehicle. He fell down and fractured his left hand. He tried to run away but he was caught by the people.

“The alarm raised by the victim drew the attention of the people and that helped us to nab him,” Inspector of Police (Melur), S. Charles, said.

Even if he managed to flee from the scene, he would have been apprehended as his mobile phone and number plate of his vehicle had fallen down at the scene of crime. The Melur police recovered the gold chain and seized the two-wheeler. Interrogation revealed that Raja Mohammed had resorted to make quick money as he had fallen in debts. After being provided first-aid at the Government Hospital in Melur, he was sent to remand on Saturday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/chain-snatching-lands-him-in-too-many-troubles/article32881563.ece

People would also be administered the oath to remain cautious.

Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha said people should follow COVID-19 protocol, including wearing face masks, maintaining social distance, frequently washing hands etc., till a vaccine was available. A detailed plan of action was prepared for the awareness campaign wherein people would be told that it would be their responsibility to protect their family members from the pandemic.

As many as 172 people have died of COVID-19 in the district and more than 75% of them were aged above 60 and had comorbidities. Therefore, it is the responsibility of every family member to look after elders in their households. That was the reason for holding this massive awareness campaign for the first time, Mr. Jagadeesha said.

276,2020/10/17,Potholes resurface on NH 75 at Nanthoor Junction,"Potholes and craters have resurfaced on the portion of Mangaluru-Bengaluru National Highway 75 bypass at Nanthoor Junction severely affecting traffic in the busy junction.

Parts of the bypass that were repaired with fresh bitumen coat during summer gave way once the South West Monsoon started. As the vehicles towards Bengaluru move slowly to negotiate craters and potholes, traffic through the junction on NH 66 and Kadri Road gets affected, said a traffic police constable posted at the spot.

Dinesh Kumar, a resident of nearby Bikarnakatte, said improper rainwater drainage facility at the junction could be the reason for frequent erosion of the road surface. Though the National Highways Authority of India had built a culvert to drain out rainwater on the bypass near the junction, connecting shoulder drains were not properly completed, thereby causing water stagnation.

277,2020/10/17,Relatives of ruling party MLA involved in illegal bauxite extraction: Ramanath Rai,"They belong to another religion and cannot be my relatives, says Bantwal MLA Rajesh Naik

Former Minister B. Ramanath Rai on Saturday alleged that relatives of a ruling party MLA were indulging in illegal bauxite extraction in Mudipu and surrounding areas in the district, thereby causing huge loss to the State exchequer.

He told reporters that those engaged in the illegal extraction were using permits given for laterite stone extraction at Ganjimutt in Mudipu, Balepuni, Innoli, and surrounding areas. Along with the relatives of the MLA, people from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala too were involved, he said.

Misuse of the permit given for Ganjimutt in Badaga Yedapadavu village was known to the MLA as well as the district administration. The Mangaluru Assistant Commissioner, who led a raid on illegal extraction at Mudipu, was abruptly transferred by the government, Mr. Rai said. Comparing it to the Ballari mining mafia, he demanded a high-level probe.

Asked to name the MLA, Mr. Rai said the probe would bring out the names. District Congress president K. Harish Kumar and others were present.

‘Not my relatives’

Responding to Mr. Rai’s charges, Bantwal MLA Rajesh U. Naik, who has permit for laterite stone extraction in Ganjimutt, said he had stopped a year ago as the royalty was steeply increased. “Those engaged in illegal extraction at Mudipu belong to another religion. How could they be my relatives? It is Mr. Rai’s imagination,” he said, adding they must be relatives of the Mangaluru MLA.

He told The Hindu that those engaged in illegal extraction of bauxite at Mudipu now bought laterite stones from him at the Ganjimutt block earlier. Later, they stopped.

Regarding the transfer of Mangaluru AC (Madan Mohan C.), Mr. Naik said he was the one representing to the Chief Minister the other day to cancel the transfer order and retain him in Mangaluru.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/r22h92/article32883194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGBRAMANATHARAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/relatives-of-ruling-party-mla-involved-in-illegal-bauxite-extraction-ramanath-rai/article32883195.ece

The famed Mysuru Dasara is set to take off on Saturday amidst a slew of precautionary measures and curbs in the light of the pandemic.

HDFC Bank Ltd. reported second-quarter net profit jumped 18.4% to ₹7,513.1 crore, from ₹6,354 crore a year earlier, helped by healthy growth in loans and a narrowing of NPAs.

The private lender’s net revenue (net interest income plus other income) grew to ₹21,868.8 crore in the three months ended September 30, from ₹19,103.8 crore.

Net interest income expanded by 16.7% to ₹ 15,776.4 crore, driven by asset growth of 21.5% and a core net interest margin of 4.1%.

Wholesale loans jump

Total advances increased 15.8% to ₹10,38,335 crore as of September 30. Domestic advances grew by 15.4% with retail loans rising 5.3% and domestic wholesale loans climbing by 26.5%.

Gross and net non-performing assets (NPAs) were at 1.08% of gross advances and 0.17% of net advances, respectively.

Since the Supreme Court in an interim order dated September 3 had directed that accounts which were not declared NPA till August 31, 2020, should not be declared as such until further orders, the accounts that would have otherwise been classified as NPA had not been and would not be classified as NPA till such time that the court rules finally on the matter, the bank said.

Proforma gross NPA

“However, if the bank had classified borrower accounts as NPA after August 31, 2020, and also adopted an early recognition of NPA using its analytical models (proforma approach), the proforma gross NPA ratio would have been 1.37% as on September 30, as against 1.36% as on June 30 and 1.38% as on September 30, 2019,” the bank said in a regulatory filing.

The lender said proforma net NPA ratio would have been 0.35%. “Pending disposal of the case, the bank, as a matter of prudence, has made a contingent provision in respect of these accounts.”

HDFC Bank said its continued focus on deposits helped in the maintenance of a healthy liquidity coverage ratio at 153%, well above the regulatory requirement.

It said while the previous quarter largely bore the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the softness continued into the current quarter leading to lower retail loan origination, use of debit and credit cards by customers, efficiency in collection efforts and waivers of certain fees.

Card momentum better

“As a result, fees/other income were lower by approximately ₹800 crore. However, the loan and card momentum has improved over the previous quarter, thereby reducing the gap to less than half,” HDFC Bank said.

Provisions and contingencies for the quarter were ₹3,703.5 crore (consisting of specific loan loss provisions of ₹1,240.6 crore and general and other provisions of ₹2,462.9 crore).

“Total provisions for the current quarter includes contingent provisions of approximately ₹2,300 crore for proforma NPA as described in the asset quality section below as well as additional contingent provisions to make the balance sheet more resilient,” it said.

The total balance sheet size as of September 30 was ₹16,09,428 crore, an increase of 21.5% from ₹13,25,072 crore a year earlier.

Total deposits as of September 30 were ₹12,29,310 crore, an increase of 20.3%.

The lender also said it continued to hold provisions as on September 30 against the potential impact of COVID-19 and that the same was in excess of the RBI’s norms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/2y619f/article32882966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THBUHDFC,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/hdfc-bank-q2-profit-rises-184-to-7513-crore/article32882967.ece

290,2020/10/17,"Lower taxes, better roads needed to grow luxury car segment: BMW India head","Tax policy deters buyers: BMW’s Pawah

To push demand for luxury cars in India, it is important to develop road infrastructure and to normalise the tax regime, which, in the current form dissuades people from buying luxury cars, BMW Group India President Vikram Pawah said.

“...as the road network gets developed, I’m sure you know people will like to drive even better cars... The second part is on the regulatory or the taxation policy... Currently, people are dissuaded from buying luxury cars because of the taxation regime, the way it exists...To some degree, we are depriving ourselves as India...that we are not able to experience the same technology, the same luxury, the same facilities that our counterparts in the world enjoy,” Mr. Pawah said, replying to a query.

“Taxation needs to be normalised so that people can choose the latest technologies. Currently, a level playing field is not provided... people are not allowed to choose the latest technologies they want to try. Once those things are corrected, you will see the market booming again for luxury cars,” he added.

Mr. Pawah, however, added that he expected the BMW brand to continue to grow on the back of new product launches. “We are in the midst of the biggest product offensive and we will continue to introduce products over the next 18 to 24 months that that will excite the market.”

The German luxury car maker on Thursday introduced the first-ever BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé in India which will be produced at BMW Group Plant in Chennai. The car, with a starting price of ₹39.30 lakh, will be available immediately in the diesel variant, while the petrol version will be launched later.

Asked about taking the number one spot in India’s luxury car market, Mr. Pawah said, “Being number one in a very small pond is not an achievement. For me, the achievement is to be number one in increasing the size of the market, driving the growth of the market, outperforming the segment, making sure that we are growing at a faster rate than the segment is growing, and that will make us number one automatically.”

He added that with new products lined up, the brand is confident of attracting new customers as well as attracting customers from other brands.

On the impact of COVID-19, Mr. Pawah said in the current year, every quarter had been a different story. While in Q1 the industry saw transition from BS-IV to BS-VI emission norms, the second quarter was a total washout and some month-on-month recovery was seen July onwards.

“...With the festive season around the corner, we expect that trend to continue... so we expect the sales to steadily increase over the rest of the quarter and towards the end of the year. However, having said that, I would say the entire 2020 will still be lower than 2019, obviously, because we had a complete quarter missing. But I see a steady improvement from now onwards, into 2021.”

He added that he saw the year 2020 as a “detriment”, rather than a setback mainly because of the trend worldwide that countries that are coming out of COVID-19, are seeing “really strong growth and I do expect the same to happen in India as well.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/9q7qld/article32877058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BMW-pawah-1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tax-cut-better-roads-to-boost-luxury-car-sales/article32877059.ece
291,2020/10/17,China’s rise and fall at the UN,"It’s an opportune time for New Delhi to push for institutional changes and reformed multilateralism in the global system

The United Nations turned 75 this year. In normal times, September would have seen a grand Summit in New York but because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, world leaders were forced to do with video messages to the UN General Assembly. The UN season, though, started on an auspicious note for India, with India besting China in the elections for a seat on the UN’s Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). This was the first such victory in a decade.

To add to China’s woes, soon after the CSW vote, it lost another election, this time to tiny Samoa for a seat on the UN Statistical Commission. And a couple of days ago, it just about managed to get elected to the UN High Rights Council, coming fourth out of five contestants for four vacancies. Earlier, China’s candidate had lost to a Singaporean in the race for DG World Intellectual Property Organization.

China’s strengths

In 2011, India defeated China in a one-on-one election at the UN for a place on the Joint Inspection Unit. Thereafter, taking advantage of its position as a member of the P-5 and as a huge aid giver, China made itself invincible in UN elections, capturing, among others, the top positions at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Indeed, India, too, felt this was a UN election behemoth not to be trifled with, and even as late as last year, pulled out its candidate against the Chinese from the race for the Director-General, FAO.

But how did China rise to this pre-eminent position at the UN. It all began, as is the case with India and multilateralism, a century ago with World War I. India was one of the largest contributors of soldiers in the war against Germany and Turkey and became a founding member of the League of Nations even though it was a colony. At the end of WWII, India participated in all the three UN conferences becoming a charter member of the UN even before Independence. Pakistan, on the other hand, joined the UN in September 1947 on application.

China saw an opportunity in World War I to rid itself of German occupation from some of its territory and allied with the United Kingdom and France. But they could not send soldiers as the Japanese, who were in competition with the Germans for the same Chinese territories, also allied against the Germans and refused to countenance Chinese troops in action. So, the Chinese sent large numbers of labour to support the western war efforts against Germany and won an invite at the Versailles Peace Conference. Things, however, did not turn out well as the West sided with the Japanese and China refused to sign the Versailles Peace Treaty.

Comment | China’s growing clout at the UN

The United States, though, was sympathetic to the Chinese cause, and a few years later helped reach a peace deal between China and Germany.

World War II saw strong U.S.-China collaboration against the Japanese, including U.S. operations conducted from India. An incidental but pleasant fallout of the stationing of U.S. forces in India was the establishment of ice-cream makers in India who, at the end of the war, bought the plants brought by the U.S. for its forces.

America’s ‘forgotten ally’

These old trans-Pacific linkages of the U.S. and China, including the presence of a very large Chinese community on the west coast of the U.S., are not well known, especially in India, but China is really “the forgotten ally” of the U.S. to use an expression coined by Oxford Professor Rana Mitter. This is important to bear in mind as the world, and India, pontificates the outcome of a U.S.-China contestation and its implications for multilateralism.

Their bilateral ties saw the U.S. include the Chinese in the ‘Four Policemen’, a group of the most important countries for ensuring world peace post- World War II, along with the real victors of World War II — the U.S., the USSR and the U.K. This number morphed into the P-5, with France being added by the UK at the San Francisco conference held in 1945 where the UN charter was finalised. The pure multilateralism of the League of Nations was thus infused with a multipolarity, with the U.S. as the sheet anchor.

The U.S. also thought that China would act as a bulwark against the USSR. But that was the Republic of China (RoC) led by the Kuomintang who were soon routed on the mainland by the communists and found themselves on the island of Formosa (now Taiwan). This is important as the People’s Republic of China (PRC) would have us believe that it was a founder of the UN.

Comment | A multilateral alternative, by Asia

RoC retained the UN seat of China till 1971 when it was expelled from the UN and the PRC admitted as a member giving it a de jure pole position at the UN. U.S. President Richard Nixon visited Beijing in 1972 and the U.S.’s opening to the PRC certainly paved the way for the unprecedented economic growth of China. However, in its march to global hegemony, the COVID-19 pandemic may have caught China on the wrong foot.

Institutional transformations

Multilateralism is under unprecedented stress fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic and a certain disenchantment with globalisation. At the root, of course, is the rise of China and its challenge to U.S. global hegemony. But for global action there are no substitutes for multilateralism backed by strong multipolarity relevant to contemporary realities. This demands institutional reform and not just engagement with extant issues which form the song and dance of diplomacy.

Perhaps most important are institutional reforms in the UN Security Council (UNSC) and at the Bretton Woods Institutions so that their governance leverages the capabilities of the major players among both the developed and developing countries. In this context, it is good that recently India, Germany, Japan and Brazil (G-4) have sought to refocus the UN on UNSC reform. As proponents of reform, they must remain focused and determined even if these changes do not happen easily or come soon. This is also the way forward for India which is not yet in the front row.

Comment | Multilateralism post COVID-19

A window opens

Earlier in the year, India was elected as a non-permanent member of the UNSC for a two-year term. India will also host the BRICS Summit next year and G-20 Summit in 2022. These are openings for India in coalescing the world in critical areas that require global cooperation especially climate change, pandemics and counter-terrorism. India also needs to invest in the UN with increased financial contributions in line with its share of the world economy and by placing its people in key multilateral positions.

Three defeats and a near defeat for China in elections to UN bodies post-COVID-19 and the negative reaction to its threat of veto to forestall a discussion on the pandemic in the UNSC clearly point to a disenchantment with China in the globe and is a thumbs down for them. It is also an opportune moment for India and a Reformed Multilateralism.

292,2020/10/17,Hope amid uncertainty: On IMF’s World Economic Outlook,"IMF calls for more international cooperation as the world economy recovers slowly

The IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook sums up the challenges ahead in the report’s title: ‘A long and difficult ascent’. With COVID-19 having already extracted a toll of over a million lives, accompanied by an evisceration of livelihoods and output in economies, prognosticating the economic future even as the pandemic rages on is an unenviable task. The Fund’s economists have gamely sought to make forecasts for world output through 2020, 2021 and into the medium term. While the global economy is projected to shrink 4.4% this year, reflecting a less severe contraction than the 5.2% drop estimated in June, output is seen rebounding at a marginally slower 5.2% pace in 2021. The IMF has based its revision on “better-than-anticipated second-quarter GDP out-turns, mostly in advanced economies” where activity improved after lockdowns were eased, as well as signs of a stronger recovery in the July-September quarter. But the IMF has been prudent in pointing out that even as the world economy ascends out of the depths it plunged to in April, following the worldwide lockdown, there remains the danger of a resurgence in infections that is prompting countries in Europe to reimpose at least partial closures. And the risks associated with predicting the pandemic’s progression, the unevenness of public health responses, and the extent to which domestic activity can be disrupted, magnify the uncertainty.

Pointing out that the pandemic is set to leave scars well into the medium term ‘as labour markets take time to heal, investment is held back by uncertainty and balance sheet problems, and lost schooling impairs human capital’, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath contends that global growth will gradually slow to about 3.5% in the medium term. With the cumulative loss in output relative to the pre-pandemic projected path estimated to more than double to $28 trillion over 2020–25, efforts to improve average living standards are certain to be severely set back. Observing that the pandemic is set to widen inequality between economies and within nations, the Fund has urged greater international cooperation. It is imperative for all countries to work closely to ensure that new treatments and vaccines are made available to all since wider and faster availability of medical solutions could boost global income by almost $9 trillion by end-2025, reducing income divergence, she says. With no visibility yet on vaccine availability, the IMF has also stressed the need for policymakers to persist with direct income support for the most vulnerable and regulatory forbearance for stressed but viable firms. The message is clear. In a world as interconnected as it is today, the cost of economic insularity would only be more protracted pain for all.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hope-amid-uncertainty-the-hindu-editorial-on-imfs-world-economic-outlook-2020/article32876253.ece
293,2020/10/17,Valley’s voice: On J&K’s Gupkar alliance,"The Centre must respect the voices of reason and moderation in Kashmir

The announcement, on Thursday, by five regional parties and the CPI(M), of the formation of the ‘Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration’ to fight for the restoration of full statehood and special constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir, is one that has also coincided with the release of former J&K Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti after 14 months in detention. The Gupkar Declaration by these parties, on August 4, 2019, had anticipated the Centre’s move to repeal J&K’s special status the next day and vowed to fight for its protection. J&K also lost its statehood. The NC, the PDP, People’s Conference, Awami National Conference, the J&K Peoples Movement, and CPI (M) have now reiterated their earlier pledge; the Awami Ittehad Party and the Peoples Democratic Front too have declared their support. The coming together of the rival regional parties is strange and significant; this is no electoral alliance, but a political meeting point on the status of Kashmir. It is a result of the perception that politics in J&K is a face-off with the Centre and a reflection of increased Kashmiri alienation from the national mainstream. The framing of Kashmir politics as a combat with the Centre has been forced upon the regional parties by the BJP government through its reckless policies.

In 2015, the BJP-PDP coalition government in J&K appeared like the maturing of a progressive trend. The BJP and the NC were in alliance at the Centre earlier. With two main national parties, the Congress and the BJP, forming opportunistic alliances with two regional parties, there were reasons to believe that politics in Kashmir was not out of step with the national mainstream. Besides participation of Kashmiri parties in national coalition governments, the debate within had begun to echo political debates elsewhere in the country — with development and governance increasingly taking centre stage. Debates on autonomy and self-determination continued, but did not overwhelm politics in Kashmir. As it turned out, alliances with regional actors did not temper the BJP’s strident opposition to the notional special status. It sought to delegitimise regional parties by terming them ‘soft separatists,’ and unleashed state agencies against them. J&K’s reorganisation in 2019 created new international dimensions. The BJP government at the Centre evidently believes that domination, not accommodation, is the way forward in Kashmir, which has helped the party’s electoral appeal in the heartland, and acts as an incentive. With sufficient amount of force, any policy is enforceable on the ground, but that is not a moral choice that democratic societies make. National integration advanced through patient negotiations and accommodation is more enduring and formidable. It is time for a new beginning in Kashmir and the Centre should be sensitive to the sentiments expressed in the Gupkar Declaration.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/valleys-voice-the-hindu-editorial-on-jks-peoples-alliance-for-gupkar-declaration/article32876251.ece

295,2020/10/17,Aditya Alva tells HC there is no recognisable offence by him; CCB says otherwise,"CCB says incriminating materials found on his property premises

The Central Crime Branch told the Karnataka High Court that certain incriminating materials like small quantity of psychotropic pills and ganja were seized from the premises belonging to Aditya Alva, one of the accused in the drug racket case allegedly involving Kannada actors.

Mr. Alva, in his petition before the court, claimed that the complaint in the drug case “does not even make a remote reference or whisper on any acts or omission or any recognisable offence by him under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.”

However, the CCB’s statement claimed that a few grams of pills and certain quantity of ganja were seized during the search at his property, House of Life, near Hebbal in the city, and contended that available materials and statements of other accused are sufficient to attract cognizable offence against him. The CCB had issued lookout notice against him, who is at large since registration of the case.

Justice Suraj Govindaraj, before whom the petition came up for hearing on October 16, has adjourned further hearing till November 13.

Degree from London

Stating that he holds master’s degree in International Diplomacy and International Law from SOAS College of University of London and a bachelor’s degree in International Politics from the University of San Francisco, Mr. Alva has alleged that, “without prejudice, he humbly believes that the police has sought to arraign him as one of the accused presumably due to the flood of rumours and false allegations that were peddled by media and certain politically motivated armed chair warriors who have attempted to wreak vendetta against him and his family members.”

Pointing out that he hails from a respectable family of politicians who made significant contributions to the State, Mr. Alva, a realtor by profession, said that he has been “painted with a brush of guilt, even before he has been afforded with an opportunity of being heard, by the hoi polloi in general and the media houses in particular solely on the score that a crime has been registered, which is, in fact, an act beyond the purview of the legal sphere.”

296,2020/10/17,SWD work keeps buses out of MTC terminus in Kovur,"Due to lack of easy access to the facility, the buses are now parked on Porur-Kundrathur Main Road

Stormwater drains along Porur-Kundrathur Main Road were widened recently, and the work involving the drain in front of the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) terminus in Kovur, has caused a new problem.

The exercise does not seem to have factored in how MTC buses could enter the terminus if the drain is two feet higher than the floor of the terminus. A narrow portion has been left untouched to let buses roll in and out of the terminus. However, this section being narrow, drivers can’t negotiate it with ease. As a result, buses are lined up outside the terminus.

With bus drivers fighting shy of using it, the narrow passage has been blocked with wooden logs to prevent motorists from parking their vehicles, including cabs and autorickshaws, inside the terminus. As buses now halt on the road, commuters are put to great inconvenience.

“When it rains, we take shelter inside the terminus and when the bus arrives, we have to run to board the bus which halts on the road,” says K. Saroja, a resident of Kovur.

Commuters say that the work exposes the lack of coordination between the government departments including the State Highways Department and the Kancheepuram Collectorate.

In this regard, an official from the Kancheepuram Collectorate says, “The height of the floor in the terminus will be increased so that movement of the buses will not be affected.”

The drain which is now three feet wide and six feet deep is meant to discharge excess rainwater from the surrounding locality to the Porur lake nearby and thereby prevent inundation on Porur-Kundrathur Main Road. The drains were widened following the construction of more than half-a-dozen culverts along the road. The localities along the road — Kundrathur, Kovur, Gerugambakkam and Porur — were severely hit by the 2015 floods. Hence, the stormwater drains were widened

Renovated at a cost of ₹7 lakh allocated under MLA Local Area Development funds of Alandur Assembly constituency in 2014, the terminus caters to residents of Kollachery, Arambedu, Erumaiyur, Kavanoor, Kolambakkam, Poonthandalam and Vaipoor. Every day, on an average, more than 120 services are operated from this terminus.

Many commuters prefer to travel to the Kundrathur bus terminus, around 2 km from Kovur, or to th Four Cross Junction, which is around one km away, to board buses as they are frequented by people round-the-clock. Besides, the police booth at the Kovur terminus is closed most of the time, especially at night, point out commuters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/27te9i/article32880984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10dctngr-Kovur-MTC-Terminus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/swd-work-keeps-buses-out-of-mtc-terminus-in-kovur/article32880985.ece
297,2020/10/17,A smart move,"Bharatanatyam has helped Ananth Raghunandan work through autism; and from United States, his family has come to India to ensure he gets the most out of the dance form

A few minutes into our conversation, Ananth Raghunandan’s right hand moves to take the form of a mudra. From his eye movement, it is clear that this comes spontaneously for this young dancer whose parents have come from Miami, United States, to fulfil his desire to have his Bharatanatyam arangetram in Chennai. Ananth and his family are now living in Kasturibai Nagar, Adyar.

What’s inspiring about this journey to Bharat through Natya, as the family calls it, is how Ananth beat the odds through dance. Twenty-two-year-old Ananth is on the autism spectrum, and his experience makes it clear that there is therapeutic value in movement.

It is eight years since Ananth started learning dance.

“I am a regular at the Music Season, not so much for the dance as for the fact that it helps Ananth. We did not chose Bharatanatyam for him; he chose it for himself,” says K. Raghunandan, Ananth’s father.

Guru Harija Sivakumar in Miami was his first guru. Later, professor K. Mohanan from Kalakshetra Foundation started offering him lessons.

“He had many sensory-motor challenges and was introduced to karate, hip-hop and tap in Miami, but nothing made as much difference as Bharatanatyam,” says Rama, Ananth’s mother.

On Ananth’s Bharatanatyam arangetram, she says, “The practice sessions were continuous and intense and we are glad Ananth completed this milestone.”

She points out that Ananth’s foot movement and rhythm are his strengths. She says due to regular dance practice his posture has improved tremendously. “I can see so many subtle changes in him — his eyesight is sharper and his hand-eye coordination has improved,” she says.

As Bharatanatyam is partly rhythmic chanting, it has helped in his speech too.

Ananth’s passion for Bharatanatyam led the family to explore more opportunities for him in India. Since the last two years, he has been pursuing a diploma programme in Hospital Record and Documentation Management at Dr. Kamakshi Memorial Hospital (KMH) thanks to encouragement from Dr. T.G. Govindarajan, chairman and managing director of the hospital.

Besides dance, Ananth is well-versed with the piano and actively codes for HashHackCode, an organisation that provides inclusive tech education and mentorship. Interestingly, Ananth’s website (ananthdance.com) was developed by Prem, a HashHackCode student with autism, in time for his arangetram.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/igwelh/article32880890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dcAnanth-Raghunandan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-smart-move/article32880891.ece
298,2020/10/17,A new timetable for tiny tots,"From weekend classes to one-on-one sessions, play schools are making an effort to align themselves with parents’ interests

It is 10 a.m. on a weekday, and Indumathy R. is bracing herself for the next challenge of the day, by far the stiffest — assisting her four-and-a-half-year-old daughter Kural Venba with 45 minutes of online classes.

“Sometimes I have to coax her into sitting upright before the laptop as her attention span is limited,” says Indumathy who has started attending the online classes with her daughter since a month ago.

This is how most days begin for Indumathy.

“We have to make some adjustments or our child is going to miss out on so many things,” says Indumathy, who also has to attend to the demands of a three-month-old child. To handle the little crises at home, sometimes she gets the support of her husband, who works from home, or her mother.

With play schools switching to online classes, parents have to work with them now.

Most play schools want one of the parents to sit through the class; some have reworked their timetable, offering the classes in the evenings and weekends, keeping the challenges faced by working parents in mind.

Also Read: Pandemic brings social initiative into play at pre-school

Of the 15 children enrolled with Mahima Cultural Centre in Mylapore, seven are regular to the online classes.

“Increasingly, we have parents of tiny tots seeking one-on-one classes as they don’t think group online classes help the children,” says Manju B, headmistress of the centre that runs a play school and an activity centre. Of the seven students, three have opted for the morning hours and the rest prefer evenings and weekends. “One parent has opted for a 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. slot as he would be free from all meetings at this hour,” says Manju.

Classes do not exceed 30 minutes but for this arrangement to be fruitful we need greater participation of parents, she says.

“Even if it is just 30 minutes, children get distracted easily so we insist on a parent sitting next to the child to give the necessary encouragement,” says Manju.

Velammal VKids at Mogappair has a 30-minute lesson through video call for parents and children during weekends.

“We have 300 students from pre-KG to UKG enrolled with us and nearly 20% of them are signed up for the weekend classes as their parents find this timing convenient. Here, we either offer classes in batches of two or three or have one-on-one session,” says Mary Manimala, headmistress of the school, adding that a parent must be around when a child is taking an online class.

Opinion is divided on the effectiveness of one-on-one classes.

Charanya Prabhakar, founder, Oyster Montessori in Alwarpet, says they don’t encourage one-on-one classes for toddlers. While learning, a child has to see other children and feel like they are part of a classroom environment. So, they have a mix of students — not exceeding 12 — across age groups in the virtual class.

Based on a two-month research including feedback from children and parents, the centre has tweaked the timetable for pre-schoolers, moving it to the evenings – between 4 p.m. and 4.30 p.m.

“This is a huge shift for us as in pre-COVID days we always had classes in the mornings,” says Charanya.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ai05kk/article32880869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18DCADYRPLAYSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-new-timetable-for-tiny-tots/article32880870.ece
299,2020/10/17,Coronavirus | Pandemic brings social initiative into play at pre-school,"A play school in Adyar engages its support staff in the work of making and distributing paper bags for free to commercial establishments

A pre-school-cum-day care centre at Gandhi Nagar in Adyar is filling the lull caused by the pandemic with a social initiative. With the free time at their disposal, its non-teaching support staff make paper bags and distribute them for free to 15 commercial establishments around Gandhi Nagar. This exercise may be a timely reminder that the Tamil Nadu government has banned single-use plastic in January 2019: For single-use plastic is said to be in circulation due to fewer checks on account of the pandemic.

Play-Coop, a 37-year-old pre-school, has 12 support staff and six teachers, the latter now taking online classes for students.

“For the last three to four months, we have been asking our support staff to come twice a week to clean the centre but we wanted to bring more meaning to this routine and that’s how we got them to make paper bags,” says Princess Naik, founder, Play-Coop.

In the early months, those dependent on public transport were exempt from this weekly assignment.

Princess underlines that many support staff are long-serving employees, some of them employed with the school for around two decades. “We been paying them 60 per cent of their salary every month since the lockdown began,” she says.

The ayammas make paper bags — an average of 10 each — every Wednesday and Saturday to be given to provision stores and pharmaceutical outlets in Gandhi Nagar. A note stuck to each paper bag denotes that it is an eco-friendly community project, and carries the centre’s address.

The distribution is handled by a school staff, Ravi Kumar, who hands the bags to the beneficiaries — at present, 10 stores of different stripes and five pharmacies every Monday.

“The response has been so encouraging — an orthopaedic clinic asked us if we could customise the bags for them. The doctor wanted two to three sheets of paper stuck and shaped like a bed,” says Princess. The newspaper required for this customised offering is sourced from teachers’ and friends’ homes.

Princess points out that paper bag-making is not a new initiative at the centre and explains: “It’s one of the first activities we teach children to make them environment conscious.”

Play-Coop plans to continue with this initiative till support staff can get started on their routine work again.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/g07gh3/article32880862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dcpaperbags,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/coronavirus-pandemic-brings-social-initiative-into-play-at-pre-school/article32880863.ece
300,2020/10/17,Sub-registrar office gets a new address,"Konnur and Ambattur SRO to function from their own spaces

For over a decade, the Konnur sub-registrar office has been something of a challenge to those making a visit. It either had to do with locating it or spending one’s time there or both.

Prior to the lockdown, it was considerably better than before, as the office was located on the first floor of a commercial complex on CTH Road in Villivakkam.

Still, for those unfamiliar with the area, it would have been something of a struggle as there were no signboards directing them to the complex. Besides, the office space inside was cramped with most visitors having to cool their heels in the car park before they were called in to attend to their queries.

Its earlier address was not visitor-friendly: It was found on Fourth Main Road, SIDCO Nagar, off CTH Road in Villivakkam. The office consisted of a single room and a small veranda with concrete slabs on both sides of the veranda for visitors. It functioned from these space for a decade, before being shifted to the commercial complex on CTH Road two years ago.

The plight of applicants visiting the Konnur sub-registrar office has finally come to an end as the office has got its own building — it is now located on the spacious premises behind the Primary Health Care centre (PHC) near the police station on CTH Road in Ambattur.

The Public Works Department (PWD) expedited the construction of Konnur and Ambattur sub registrar offices, both located on the same premises, in the early months of the lockdown. Due to easy movement of raw materials to the work site, the work was completed at least three months ahead of the schedule.

“It’s a great relief for applicants, especially senior citizens as the new office is easily accessible and bus stops also located nearby,” says S. Paramasivan, an applicant from Pattaravakkam near Ambattur.

Every day, on an average, around 40 applicants seeking documents related to land and marriage registration, among others, visit the Konnur SRO after they register their applications online with the Department of Registration.

Through an online facility, applicants can get documents like encumbrance certificates (EC), marriage certificates, stamps, circulars, society registrations and chit documents. Further, applicants can also download public utility forms such as sale deeds and power of attorney documents.

Located off Chennai-Tiruvallur High (CTH) Road, Konnur SRO was opened in November 1994 after the bifurcation of the Ambattur registration office. The SRO covers areas like Mannurpet, Villivakkam, Nolambur, Mogappair, Kakapallam, Malligaicherry, Konnur and Pattaravakkam. The existing online facility was introduced in the Konnur SRO in 2013 to bring about hassle-free registration of land. At present, the Chennai Region of the Registration Department is divided into three districts — Chennai North, Chennai Central and Chennai South — with each district having on an average 20 sub-registrar offices within its limits.

The new building of Konnur and Ambattur SRO has a large visitors hall, separate cabins for sub-registrar, office and Internet works. Basic facilities like water taps, toilets and adequate seating arrangements with social distancing norms have also been created on the new premises.

However, applicants express worry that the vast open space within the new premises may get flooded during rains as the sandy floor of the premises is a few feet below the level of CTH Road.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/f58esi/article32880830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dcangrkonnursro1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sub-registrar-office-gets-a-new-address/article32880831.ece
301,2020/10/17,A key road pockmarked with potholes,"Though the stormwater drain work has been accomplished, Maraimalai Road in Mogappair is yet to be relaid

Due to continual movement of heavy vehicles, Maraimalai Road in Mogappair is now pockmarked with potholes. With northeast monsoon at the door, residents and motorists want the civic officials of Zone – 7 of Greater Chennai Corporation to relay the stretch immediately.

Maraimalai Road is a lifeline for residents as it connects Mogappair with important areas like Anna Nagar, Tirumangalam, Ambattur, Nolambur, Padi and Korattur. The road also links East Mogappair with West Mogappair. Maraimalai Road was a bitumen-topped stretch until the work for the new wide concrete stormwater drain began last year. The work has added to the potholes, and unused sand is seen dumped on the footpath. The tiled footpath has been damaged in many spots making it difficult for pedestrians to walk safely.

The work on the SWD project is important as it aimed at preventing flooding in the neighbourhood. During the 2015 floods, much of the discharge went into the Otteri Nullah. Although the widening of the drain work was completed in the second half of 2019, the stretch has not been relaid.“With more motorists hitting the stretch, following the easing of many lockdown restrictions, frequent accidents are reported from there for the past few weeks,” says V. Ramani, a long-time resident of Mogappair, adding that they have been requesting the civic officials to relay the stretch at the earliest.

Interestingly, estimates for relaying the stretch was drawn up by Zone - 7 offcials (Ambattur) many months ago but due to procedural delays, the work has not been sanctioned so far.

“Steps will be taken to relay the stretch soon,” says a Corporation official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qa77q2/article32880821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dcangrpothole,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-key-road-pockmarked-with-potholes/article32880822.ece
302,2020/10/17,Thiruvengada Nagar residents see a long-pending demand take shape,"Thiruvengada Nagar residents are seeing a long-pending demand take shape now. Coming up along the rail line on South End Road, the barrier is expected to check trespassers

A new wall is coming up along the rail line on South End Road, Thiruvengada Nagar in Ambattur, thanks to the suspension of suburban trains due to lockdown.

Southern Railway has made use of the period to construct the side-wall that residents have been demanding for a long time to check accidents on the track, especially involving cattle.

Recently, workers with the Southern Railway were seen raising the steel beams for the construction of concrete pillars. As per estimates, the side wall will be constructed along the entire 800-metre-long South End Road and it would be around six feet high, and raised concrete platform that would be two-feet from the ground.

The work is expected to be completed in a month. “For many years, we have been asking that the passage along the track be closed because it will prevent trespassing which has caused many accidents,” says S. Suresh, secretary, Thiruvengada Nagar Residents Welfare Association in Ambattur.

The open passage along the track on the South End Road has been a sore point with residents, as it makes it easy for anti-socials and stray animals to cross over, via the tracks. Cattle rearing is common in some of these areas, and many bovines are allowed to grazing along the track and open areas in Ambattur.

The open passage has been a getaway space for miscreants and petty criminals, as they use it as an exit route after committing a crime.

A similar wall

Prior to the complete lockdown in March, Southern Railway constructed a similar side wall on the narrow rail over bridge (ROB) in Ambattur Old Town (OT) on Chennai – Tiruvallur High (CTH) Road, maintained by the State Highways Department, to prevent motorists from slipping on the sandy pathway along the carriageway and falling on the railway track below the flyover.

Built in the early 1970s, the bridge is around 100 metres long and 30 feet wide and can allow two buses to travel simultaneously. Despite vehicular traffic being on the rise, the bridge has remained an significant part of a route for thousands of motorists from western and north western parts on their way to the central parts of the city.

An active citizens’ group

Divided into 138 plots, Thiruvengada Nagar is a small locality consisting of 10 streets and two main roads. Most of the residents are employed in government sectors and industrial units at Pattaravakkam, Athipet and Ambattur. The neighbourhood is located between Ambattur and Korattur lakes on an elevated landscape.

In the early 1980s, residents would patrol the streets at night when the locality had been newly created from the Villivakkam block in Tiruvallur district. With a small team of four residents, mostly young men, they would patrol the locality between 10 p.m and 6 a.m then.

During emergencies and natural disasters, especially the 2015 floods, many residents from the neighbourhood have volunteered for relief work elsewhere in Chennai.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qtfxp1/article32880811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dcangrwall,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/thiruvengada-nagar-residents-see-a-long-pending-demand-take-shape/article32880812.ece
303,2020/10/17,Where parakeets have a fine dining experience,"A. M. V. Sudarson Sah and his family do not let these winged visitors leave their terrace hungry

Twenty-five wooden planks make a permanent fixture on A.M.V. Sudarson Sah’s terrace. He has nailed the planks to two parapet walls, arranging them in a neat row. There is a small passage between every two planks enabling people to walk around the terrace. During the rainy season, Sudarson Sah keeps the planks protected with a tarpaulin cover. Now and then, he adds a few extra planks — whenever he expects more visitors to his terrace.

A long-time resident of Ayya Mudali Street in Chintadripet, Sudarson, has been serving parakeets soaked rice, every morning and evening. It is a ritual he is said to have been following for a decade.

“Their squawks of parakeets wake us in the morning. They are punctual. But, we never keep them waiting for their food,” says 48-year-old Sudarson Sah, a small-time businessman.

An hour before the sunrise around 5 a.m, Sudarson Sah, his wife A.S. Vithya Bhai and their college-going daughter start the preparations for feeding the birds.

They rinse 20 kilograms of rice before it is soaked in a 20 litre-plastic bucket for an hour. The family divides their work with Sudarson Sah and his wife taking care of the task of washing the wooden planks and parapet walls, sweeping the terrace, soaking the rice before they are fit to be kept on the planks and walls for the birds.

Their daughter fills more than half a dozen water bowls primarily meant for pigeons and crows on the terrace.

Parakeets flock to the nearby trees before landing on the wooden planks. The family withdraws and keeps a distance to ensure the parakeets are not disturbed during their daily meal. The parakeets feed between 6 a.m and 6. 45 a.m every day. The routine is repeated in the evening. “Before having my lunch, I soak the same quantity of rice to feed the birds in the evening. Our family has never missed the routine,” says Sudarson Sah.

During the lockdown, Sudarson Sah and his family managed to source adequate quantities of rice for these birds. On an average, 35 to 40 kilograms of rice are used to feed these birds every day. In fact, a small room in his house has been converted into a storeroom to keep a stock of rice in gunny bags. Besides buying it on their own, the family was also helped by their neighbours in sourcing raw rice for the birds.

A Marathi by origin, Sudarson Sah’s grandparents moved to the neighbourhood in the early 20th century for textile business after purchasing the existing Chettinad-style house.

Charity has been the tradition for the family as they served free food for the poor regularly and gave donations to the temple festivals in the neighbourhood and elsewhere in the city every year.

However, Sudarson Sah developed the habit of feeding the parakeets only a decade ago when he saw a small group of birds flocking to his terrace regularly taking advantage of a peepal tree nearby. Then it was just a pastime for him. Later, it became a full-time activity for him and his family.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lga8pj/article32880801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18DCADYRVSUDARSONSAH1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/where-parakeets-have-a-fine-dining-experience/article32880803.ece
304,2020/10/17,Encouragement for those students who almost made it,"Every year, Starfish Scholarships India selects a student from Olcott school for a scholarship. And two IT professionals offer financial support to those students who have missed it by a whisker

Encouragement drives sustained performance, as an education-based experiment in the United States by psychologist Robert Rosenthal and educationist Leonore F. Jacobson has shown. It is natural to shine the spotlight on the victor, but it takes intent to recognise those who came up short by a few unfortunate inches.

Every year, Rahul Shankar and Sandeep Rajarajan, IT professionals and friends from college, recognise the five or six students at Olcott Memorial Higher Secondary School who have missed getting the annual scholarship by a whisker.

“For a decade now, Rosalyn Yake, a Canadian, has been extending what is called Starfish Scholarships to a student from Olcott school. Students who have gone through the Duke of Edinburgh Award, a self-development programme for children and adolescents, are considered for it. Rosalyn has a selection process through which she would pick one scholar every year and support them till they finish their higher education. Earlier, Olcott school had only Classes up to Standard X, and so, the student would be supported through Standard XI and XII in another private school and then through three years of an undergraduate college programme or four years of engineering by the scholarship offered by Rosalyn. It has been 10 years now, and 10 children have been supported by Starfish Scholarships,” explains Rahul. “In the selection process, six or seven students would make the short-list, but only one would get through. Sandeep and I decided to provide scholarships to the five or six students who almost made it by pledging a sum of money that at the end of the year amounts to our salaries for one month. The amount we contribute is not as big as Rosalyn’s, but it can still boost these students’ morale.” Rahul is associated with Starship Scholarships since 2009 when it was founded.

Duke of Edinburgh Award, instituted in the United Kingdom in 1956, has spread to the nooks and crannies of the world, as it has been adopted in many nations. Everywhere it has gone, it has assumed a new flavour; and in some cases, a new name. In India, the Award is known as the International Award for Young Persons.

“I had gone through the The Duke of Edinburgh Award programme when I was studying at PSSB — Nungambakkam. Similarly, Sandeep undertook the Award programme at PSSB — T. Nagar,” says Rahul. “Olcott school is a special project where the Duke of Edinburgh Award — London itself would pay for the expenses incurred for its various activities, including travel, through its India head-office in Delhi. For the special project, they had picked institutions that were empowering children from marginalised sections, and the Olcott school has a very rich history of that.”

Only those who have completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award can guide those pursuing it.

“My first volunteering work with the Olcott school was as a guide to children of the school undergoing the programme,” says Rahul. “While we were conducting this programme for these students, we met Rosalyn.”

Rahul and Sandeep count the initiative to encourage the five or six students who almost made it as part of their larger socio-educational initiative called “Vidamuyarchi”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vwk3f7/article32880728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dcStarfishScholarshipsPic,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/encouragement-for-those-students-who-almost-made-it/article32880729.ece
305,2020/10/17,Kilpauk Medical College’s alumni association helps government school students crack NEET,"The association assigns students of the college as mentors to school students who are attempting the test, and this year, six of these students have passed

P. Banupriya was waiting at a bus stand in Vadalur to cross the road, when a bus ran her down. “The driver’s eyesight was poor. In the accident the bone of my right leg was broken,” she recalls of the incident that took place when she was seven years old.

“I cannot walk too long as my feet hurt, and I become sick. I wear a prosthesis, but doctors said I would have to undergo a major surgery. We postponed it as I was going to take the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) this year,” she says. She has scored 116 and hopes to get into a government medical college. Her father was recently promoted as a lineman at the electricity board. Banupriya, a first-generation graduate, has an older sister who has completed ITI and is awaiting a job.

At the age of 12, N.N. Darshana was waiting at the bus stand to go to school. A car rammed into her and dragged her along. She remembers waking up to learn that her left leg had been amputated. The government school student from Mondaikadu in Kanyakumari district is the daughter of a welder. She did not let her disability come in the way of preparation for NEET.

“A few akkas who are studying at Kilpauk Medical College helped me. I would contact them through WhatsApp or call them to clear doubts. With a score of 157, she too hopes to get into a government medical college.

As a result of a congenital deformity K.S. Kishore Kumar does not have two toes in one lower limb. His father is a farmer in Nochili panchayat in Pallipattu village of Tiruvallur district. His father is a graduate, and his brother is preparing for the Chartered Accountancy exam. Kishore Kumar has scored 201, which he attributes to the KMC students who taught him over the phone. “They taught me 33 of the 38 biology lessons over the phone,” says the candidate who hopes to pursue a post-graduation as well.

S.M. Suriyalakshmi, who has scored 536, is an alumna of the Government Girls School in Madhuravoyal. She scored 368 marks in 2019 but did not get a seat and decided to repeat NEET this year. “Last year I was coached by the KMC students for 48 days. This year, they funded my training in a private coaching centre. The students who mentored me last year guided me by giving tips on taking the test,” she said. Her father works in a flour mill.

“Will the 7.5% reservation for government school students apply for repeaters too,” she wondered. She has not applied anywhere as she wants to pursue medicine.

Vasudevaa K.R., a student of an aided school in Madurai has scored 521. A repeater, he said his mentors gave him the confidence to take the test again. In the first attempt he scored 225 marks. His father is a farmer.

Prasad Manne, secretary of the Government Kilpauk Medical College Alumni Association said the association started to train students to qualify in NEET from 2018 onwards. A handful of students have benefited from their effort. Each student is assigned a mentor, who is either from the first or second year of the college. The association provides the students with study materials.

This year six students have cleared, of which four are disabled. “They are from less privileged families.

306,2020/10/17,Tardy pace of electricity work tests Perungudi residents’ patience,"Church Road is plagued by traffic bottlenecks due to a slow-moving Tangedco project

“Due to this work dragging on, pedestrians have resigned themselves to the fact that they would have to walk bang in the middle of the road, their safety at risk. Besides, swirls of dust have become a feature of life in the neighbourhood.”

That is R. Chandrasekharan, a resident of Church Road in Perungudi, expressing his angst over a Tangedco work that seems to have trouble winding up.

For close to two months, the Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) has kept Church Road in Perungudi dug-up for laying its underground cables. With the work on the nearly two-kilometre-long road progressing at a tardy pace, as Chandrasekharan points out, residents are battling a variety of problems.

Residents point out that due to this work, vehicles are parked well into the carriageway, which creates traffic bottlenecks, especially during rush hour.

Residents want Tangedco to complete the work at the earliest so that Greater Chennai Corporation can relay the road.

“If this problem persists and is not set right before the north-east monsoon sets in, the situation is going to be really bad,” says Chandrasekharan.

According to an official of Zone 14, Greater Chennai Corporation, road-laying work would be taken up on Church Road only after Tangedco completes all the work on all the roads in the vicinity.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qymfdk/article32879368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dcadyrChurch-Road-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tardy-pace-of-electricity-work-tests-perungudi-residents-patience/article32879370.ece
307,2020/10/17,Residents of Gandhi Nagar and Sastri Nagar pick holes in road work,"They say proper milling has not been carried out on some of the roads

Members of Spark, a city-based civic forum, have complained that some roads in the Gandhi Nagar and Sastri Nagar have been relaid without adherence to standard milling procedures. Greater Chennai Corporation undertook road-relaying work in these localities in August.

“The Gandhi Nagar Third Main Road and Fourth Main Road have to be milled up to 80mm to make up for the lack of milling in the past,” says T. D. Babu, founder-member of Spark.

Another norm that has been thrown to the wind is milling of road surfaces charactereised by intersections.

To illustrate, they draw attention to a manhole at the intersection of First Cross Street and Second Cross Street in Sastri Nagar which is now at a higher level.

As a result, sewage from septic tanks in houses on Second Cross Street would not flow into the sewage drain. Besides, the mouth of a chamber of a stormwater drain has been covered by the road surface.

Even the manholes have almost “sunk”, note residents.

It’s also said that potholes have been ignored on some patches.

The mud and other kinds of trash have not been removed before the road work was carried out, allege residents.

Besides, the mandatory gap between the road and the pavements has not been maintained, and this would prevent rainwater percolation into the ground and result in water-logging, residents add.

Residents of Adyar insist that the practice of informing residents before road-relaying work should be followed. Doing so would enable them to monitor the work and inform the Greater Chennai Corporation of any flaws.

They have also sought that work sites sport a board with the name of the contractor and the name and phone number of the GCC engineer in charge of the work.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-of-gandhi-nagar-and-sastri-nagar-pick-holes-in-road-work/article32879359.ece
308,2020/10/17,Residents seek restoration of RWH well on road in Guindy,"They complain of water stagnation as the height of Race View Colony Main Road Extension has been increased

Residents of Race View Colony Main Road Extension in Guindy have requested the Zone 13 of Greater Chennai Corporation to scrap, mill and relay a section of the road. According to residents, that section of the road had been relaid by a resident who moved into the locality in November 2019. He relaid the road in front of his house and therefore the height of the road has increased.

They have also drawn attention to another issue: A rainwater harvesting structure constructed by GCC getting covered with a layer of concrete, leading to water stagnation on this section whenever it rains.

Further, the water does not flow into the stormwater drains located beneath the railway tracks at the Guindy railway station.

Southern Railway has drilled a hole on the wall abutting the track to make sure rainwater flows into the stormwater drains.

Residents also complain of mosquitoes breeding in the stagnant water.

Race View Colony witnesses heavy traffic by virtue of its proximiy to Guindy railway station and Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) bus stops. According to residents, complaints have been submitted to GCC but they are of no avail.

In this respect, a Zone 13 official says, “We will look into the issue and take remedial measures.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nk369c/article32879353.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dcadyr-Road-in-Guindy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-seek-restoration-of-rwh-well-on-road-in-guindy/article32879355.ece
309,2020/10/17,Class 12 student on a mission,"Gunisha Aggarwal helps underprivileged school and college students get smartphones and tablets to pursue their online classes

In September, when online classes began for Sangeetha. R, a first-year commerce student at D.G. Vaishnav College, she relied on her elder sister’s smartphone to attend them.

It was an inconvenient arrangement, particularly for the elder sister — who is married and lives near Sangeetha’s home — to give her kid sister the smartphone in the morning and collect it in the evening. On days when Sangeetha had homework to do, she would wait for hours before returning home with her smartphone.

This arrangement came to an end when their mother, a sweeper at an office, learnt about Help E-Learning Programme (HELP) started by Gunisha Aggarwal, a Class 12 student of Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan School — Nungambakkam.

HELP provides smartphones to underprivileged school and college students to help them attend their online classes. One of the beneficiaries of this two-month-old programme, Sangeetha says, “I never expected to own a smartphone. My father is an auto-rickshaw driver and we can’t afford even a basic smartphone.”

Gunisha gave serious thought to taking up this work when her mother Vaneeta Aggarwal gave a spare laptop to their housemaid’s daughter so that she could attend online classes. The fact that she would be helping bridge the digital divide in her own small way was the deciding factor.

Also read: School for underprivileged children takes a big leap to tackle the digital divide

“To further the objectives of HELP, a website, www.helpchennai.org, has been developed. Through this site, people can express their interest in donating their spare laptops, tablets or smartphones. Besides, students can place a request seeking a device. We seek details like the names of the student, school or college, parents’ occupation and family income. People can also volunteer with HELP, which includes checking and servicing the gadgets that we collect. So far, HELP has reached out to 10 students and received 250 requests in the past few days. The response for donation of devices is also good. So far, we have received 50 gadgets,” says Gunisha, daughter of Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, Commissioner, Greater Chennai City Police.

Reports of how youngsters are struggling to get smartphones to attend online classes are said to be driving people to support the HELP initiative.

There are two incidents that are particularly gripping. L. Samuel, a 16-year-old from Kodungaiyur who had completed Class 10, was found cleaning a stormwater drain near Koyambedu market so that he could earn some money towards buying smartphone to attend online classes. The Pulianthope and Anna Nagar police provided him with a tablet.

In another incident, a 13-year-old schoolboy was lured by a criminal gang into phone-snatching. While trying to snatch a mobile phone from a truck driver, he was caught and handed over to the police. When questioned by the Thiruvottiyur police, the juvenile cited the need for a mobile to attend online classes as what drove him to the criminal act. Later, the Thiruvottiyur police gifted him a smartphone.

The Rotary Club of Chennai Towers has supported HELP by providing it with 100 new tablets. The initiative has also reached out to 82 students at Seva Chakkra, an orphanage in Choolai.

“My elder sister, Arshita Aggarwal, a law graduate, also supports this cause by identifying needy students and connecting us with non-governmental organisations. We are also planning to approach teachers of schools run by the Greater Chennai Corporation,” says Gunisha.

310,2020/10/17,Residents want more traffic police personnel on a section of Anna Main Road,"At present, traffic on this section is regulated by a lone traffic police personnel.

Chaotic traffic on section of Anna Main Road in K.K. Nagar — stretching from MGR Nagar intersection to the MTC terminus — underscores the need for deploying additional traffic police personnel there.

At present, traffic on this section is regulated by a lone traffic police personnel.

At present, the Chennai Metrowater Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) is carrying out a pipe-laying work and constructing water collection pits on this section. A new traffic arrangement came into effect in August to facilitate CMWSSB work. As per the arrangement, motorists and pedestrians from Virugambakkam have to use the opposite lane where vehicles from Ashok Pillar junction proceed towards Virugambakkam.

With considerable easing of lockdown restrictions in September, the section witnesses more vehicular movement. Yet, only one traffic police personnel has been deployed to regulate the traffic.

Due to the congestion, ambulances can find it difficult to access houses along the section where CMWSSB is carrying out its work.

Further, this stretch witnesses frequent movement of Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses bound for Kundrathur, Iyyappanthangal and Poonamallee.

Therefore, during rush hour, significant number of commuters can be found waiting at the bus stop near MGR Nagar junction. Besides, construction workers from the region including Nesapakkam, Ashok Nagar, MGR Nagar, K.K. Nagar and Virugambakkam wait at the MGR Nagar intersection to board vehicles, arranged by construction companies, to reach them to their work sites. All of these factors add to the traffic congestion on the stretch.

Residents point out that these vehicles wait on the carriageway, thereby hindering vehicular movement.

Residents therefore feel that greater police presence is required on this section.

“Safety rules are violated. We can find many motorists driving on the wrong side of the road,” says S. Vamsi, a resident of Virugambakkam.

Motorists coming from Virugambakkam, Porur, Valasaravakkam, Kundrathur, Mangadu and Poonamallee use Anna Main Road to reach T. Nagar, Teynampet, Nandanam, Nungambakkam, Egmore and Mylapore.

Besides, many prefer to take Anna Main Road as it is part of a shorter and less congested route, when compared to nearby routes such as MOunt – Poonamallee High Road via Guindy and Arcot Road via Vadapalani.

A police official says, “Efforts will be taken soon to ensure smooth traffic movement on this stretch.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/alrxb4/article32879279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dctngr-KK-Nagar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-lone-presence-on-a-key-road/article32879280.ece
311,2020/10/17,PIL against GCC for constructing footpaths on narrow streets,"Residents of Jai Balaji Nagar in Nesapakkam argue that most of the streets are just 20-feet wide, and after construction of a pavement on both sides, they are reduced to just 12 feet

From time to time, residents of Jai Balaji Nagar in Nesapakkam have banded together for the common good. In the late nineties, it was night patrol by residents to check the movement of anti-socials. And then, collectively, they have levelled uneven stretches with construction debris; installed nameboards on streets; and greened the neighbourhood through tree-planting exercises.

Now, they are collectively battling what they believe to be ill-advised footpaths in the neighbourhood. The argument they have placed on the table for Greater Chennai Corporation to consider: Why construct a four-feet-wide footpath on both sides of a 20-feet-wide street and reduce the carraiageway to just 12 feet?

Residents point out that a majority of the streets in Jai Balaji Nagar are just 20-feet wide.

Reportedly, led by a long-time resident and a civil engineer R. Venketaraman, residents tried persuading GCC officials to give up the construction of footpaths on narrow streets, even running a signature campaign. Residents are said to be have had regular consultations and even a WhatsApp group among themselves to discuss the issue.

Now, Venketaraman has taken this ‘battle’ to a new level by filing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) at the Madras High Court, opposing footpath work on arrow stretches. The case came up for hearing a few days ago. “Jai Balaji Nagar is our neighbourhood. Greater Chennai Corporation should have held a consultation with residents before starting such a work,” says 65-year-old Venketaraman.

There is another factor that has led residents to disapprove of this pavement work: With concrete slabs, the footpaths don’t allow for rainwater percolation.

When the complete lockdown was in place, GCC had put many of its civic works on hold. When lockdown restrictions were relaxed in August, the civic body resumed many of its civic works, which include the footpath work at Jai Balaji Nagar.

With the Madras High Court asking the GCC to dispose of the representation made by the residents within a reasonable time, residents are hopeful that their grievances against such a footpath work would be addressed by the civic body.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xctq89/article32879034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dctngr-Footpath-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pil-against-gcc-for-constructing-footpaths-on-narrow-streets/article32879038.ece
312,2020/10/17,Two run over by MTC bus in Selaiyur,"The women fell from their two-wheeler because of the poorly laid road

Two young women were run over by a Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) bus after they fell from their two-wheeler on the Velachery-Tambaram Main Road near Selaiyur on Thursday.

The police identified the victims as M. Mary Roseline, 21, who worked in a financial services firm in Adambakkam, and her friend Kalaivani, 19, who was a college student. They were from Perungalathur and Nadu Veerapattu respectively.

On Thursday, they were returning home with Roseline driving and Kalaivani riding pillion.

According to the police, the vehicle toppled due to the poorly laid road and an MTC bus ran over them. After bystanders informed the authorities, the traffic investigation team, Chrompet, conducted an investigation.

The bodies were handed over to the families after post-mortem examination was conducted in the Chengalpattu Government Hospital.

313,2020/10/17,Gang stealing high-end motorcycles busted in Chennai,"They lifted bikes in the city and sold them in other districts

The police on Friday busted a gang of thieves specialising in stealing high-end motorcycles parked on roads in several parts of Chennai. The stolen bikes were sold to buyers in other districts and States. The police said the gang had established a vast network to dispose of the stolen bikes.

Following a series of complaints on the theft of bikes, a special team led by Joint Commissioner of Police (East) R. Sudhakar began investigations and cracked the case. Two weeks ago, the team nabbed three suspects — A. Mohammed Shafi, 27, of Mallipatinam, Thanjavur district; D. Sibi, 23, of Kerala; and Ameerjan, 36, of Virudhunagar district and recovered several bikes worth ₹15 lakh from them.

Based on their information, four more accused — Jamal alias Jamaluddin, 39, of Tondiarpet; Syed Ibrahim, 30, of Madhavaram; Kathiravan, 29, of Sivaganga; and Ameer, 25, of Vellore, were nabbed and 16 bikes worth ₹25 lakh were seized.

Mr. Sudhakar told The Hindu that the gang had established a wide network by using mobile messaging platforms.

“Their target was only the Bullet variant bikes parked on roads,” he said.

The modus operandi of the gang, according to the officer, was that after receiving orders on WhatsApp, they would steal bikes from Chennai and shift them to another place.

“For instance, if a bike was lifted from the city, the thief would take it to Cuddalore and park it in a secluded place. The location of the bike would be shared with members of another gang and one of them would ride away with the bike to Thanjavur. Finally, it would reach an unknown buyer in Keelakarai. We worked on several leads to nab the gang,” said Mr. Sudhakar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tdsvpl/article32877183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THbikes,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gang-stealing-high-end-motorcycles-busted-in-chennai/article32877184.ece

316,2020/10/17,Residents of Panaiyur continue stir against stormwater drains in ECR,"Corpn. carrying out the work despite protests, they allege

Residents of Panaiyur and surrounding areas staged a protest urging the Greater Chennai Corporation and State government to give up the construction of stormwater drains in areas along the seaside.

Over 500 members, including representatives from all political parties, Jamath association, residents and other activists, gathered here on Friday, and demanded the authorities to halt the project. The protesters said the civic authority had been constructing stormwater drains in areas along the seaside which already had sandy soil acting as a natural filter for rainwater. They said the drains would stop the percolation of rainwater and would lead to depletion of groundwater.

S. Asif Basha, a resident, said, “Our area was never waterlogged, even during floods. The construction of stormwater drains and concrete structures will only hinder natural percolation of rainwater. We have made representations to the State government and the Corporation Commissioner.”

319,2020/10/17,"Five suspects traced in kidnap case, CBI tells Madras High Court","They will be made to undergo narco analysis tests soon

The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday informed the Madras High Court that it had pinned down five suspects in connection with the kidnapping of a two-year-old boy from Cheyyar in Tiruvannamalai district on February 27, 2016, and subjected them to lie-detector and brain mapping tests.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha were told that the suspects would be subjected to a narco analysis tests at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru by the end of the month so that substantial progress could be made in the investigation.

Advocate G. Vrinda, representing CBI’s Special Public Prosecutor K. Srinivasan, made the submission during the hearing of a habeas corpus petition filed by the mother of the missing child in 2016. Justices S. Nagamuthu (since retired) and V. Bharathidasan had ordered a CBI probe on April 11, 2017.

Since then, the investigating agency had been taking time periodically for tracing the child and arresting the culprits. On Thursday, Justice Sathyanarayanan told the advocate that the narco analysis test results could at best help the investigators but could not be used as substantial evidence.

He expressed concern over child lifting cases being reported consistently and said even last week there was a news report on such a crime. The judge impressed upon the need for the police to crack down on organised gangs that were lifting children.

The petitioner’s counsel, P. Srinivasan, told the judges that these gangs primarily target the children of roadside dwellers. The judges directed government advocate Raghavan to make sure that a status report on steps taken by the State police to curb such crimes gets filed in the court by November 19.

When advocate T. Mohan, who had been appointed as an Amicus Curiae in a suo motu PIL petition, complained to the court that the Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights was “headless and memberless” at present, the judges decided to take a call on that issue too next month.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/five-suspects-traced-in-kidnap-case-cbi-tells-madras-high-court/article32877351.ece
320,2020/10/17,Chennai will get light to moderate rain till Monday,"Northern parts of Tamil Nadu may witness thundershowers over the weekend

Parts of north Tamil Nadu will experience wet weather till Monday as thunderstorms are set to return over the region, according to the Meteorological Department.

As the earlier depression has moved to the Arabian Sea off the Maharashtra coast, some parts of the State particularly in the north, are likely to receive light to moderate rain, said officials.

After a relatively warm day, a few areas in Chennai received light rain on Friday evening.

Convective activity

The weather stations in Nungambakkam and Madhavaram recorded less than 1 cm of rain till 6 p.m. Such convective activity will trigger rain for a few more days.

Officials said similar thunderstorm activity would continue till October 20. For the next two days, districts, including Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Cuddalore, Vellore, Kallakurichi, Villupuram, Dharmapuri, Nagapattinam and Krishnagiri, are expected to receive light to moderate rainfall.

On Saturday, rainfall may be heavy in one or two places in Dharmapuri, Salem, Tiruvannamalai and Tirupathur districts. While days may be hot in Chennai with the temperature hovering around 36 degree Celsius, convective activity will bring thundershowers in some areas during evening.

Delayed withdrawal

S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said weather systems were forming continuously in the Bay of Bengal due to the delayed withdrawal of the southwest monsoon.

Another low pressure area is likely to form over the central Bay of Bengal around October 19 and is expected to move towards Andhra Pradesh. This may influence rain over north Tamil Nadu till October 20. These weather systems have delayed easterly winds over the region. “We expect the northeast monsoon to set in by the month-end,” Mr. Balachandran added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/uaxgrb/article32877333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17OCTTHEVE-RAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-will-get-light-to-moderate-rain-till-monday/article32877334.ece

322,2020/10/17,Three more nonagenarians recover from COVID-19 in Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital,"So far, 27 patients aged above 90 have been discharged

Since the start of this week, three nonagenarians have been discharged from the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) after undergoing treatment for COVID-19. With this, as many as 27 patients, who were aged above 90 years and tested positive for COVID-19, have undergone treatment and have been discharged from the hospital.

One of the three patients, P. Vaidyanathan, who was born in 1921, completed 99 years of age on October 2. He and his wife, V. Janaki, 89, tested positive and were treated in RGGGH. The couple were discharged on Monday.

Mr. Vaidyanathan was admitted with complaints of fever, cough and breathing difficulty on October 4, and tested positive for COVID-19. A CT scan showed lung involvement and he was provided oxygen support for a day, and treated with appropriate drugs.

“He had no comorbidities and was active. He used to perform yoga everyday in the mornings. The couple was ambulant and took care of their personal needs during their hospitalisation,” RGGGH dean E. Theranirajan said.

Ms. Janaki was admitted with COVID-19 symptoms on October 5. As her swab returned positive, a CT scan was done and it showed 20% lung involvement.

“She was admitted considering the age factor. The couple recovered well,” he said.

Another nonagenarian, Jayalakshmi, 93, was discharged after treatment from RGGGH on Friday. She was in respiratory distress and was admitted to the intensive care unit.

On evaluation, doctors found that she had 95% lung involvement and oxygen saturation of 50%. She was put on a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine. The oxygen support was withdrawn gradually and she began breathing without assistance.

After being hospitalised for over 45 days, Ms. Jayalakshmi headed home on Friday after a slow recovery.

“Her 75-year-old daughter was with her throughout the hospitalisation period and took care of her as she was hard of hearing and had poor eyesight. She did not contract COVID-19,” Dr. Theranirajan said.

“Recovery is good if the elderly are treated early. Considering the age factor and comorbidities, seeking medical help as soon as possible aids them to recover,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6qxdqs/article32877296.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16OCTTHNANOGENERIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/three-more-nonagenarians-recover-from-covid-19-in-rajiv-gandhi-government-general-hospital/article32877297.ece
323,2020/10/17,Video call grievance redressal system popular among people,"Social media makes policing more visible and accessible during the pandemic

One of the first initiatives Additional Director General of Police Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal undertook soon after he took over as City Police Commissioner was to launch the scheme of enabling the public to make video calls to report their grievances.

Mr. Aggarwal took charge during the peak of the pandemic, when public gathering was prohibited. The video call grievance redressal system was introduced as a workaround to this. After calls from people started pouring in, the thrice-a-week facility was extended to the Additional Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners of Police, enabling redressal of more cases.

“Every grievance is noted down and pursued till a legal solution is arrived at. The details are computerised and transmitted to the concerned police stations for appropriate action. The scheme has particularly helped senior citizens, differently abled and women to reach out to senior police officers with their grievances,” Mr. Aggarwal said.

Another public outreach model was to publicise the name/contact number of police officials on night duty around the city. A few hundred police personnel, led by senior police officers, are deployed on night rounds covering the 135 police station limits. After their contact details were shared via social media, several calls were received from people seeking assistance.

“By deploying internet-enabled services to reach out to the public, we are not compromising on conventional policing in any way. In fact, we have introduced the concept of foot patrolling, where small teams of policemen walk through their respective police station limits. This has made policing more visible and accessible,” the Police Commissioner said.

With many young police personnel active on social media, netizens get in touch with them to share information on incidents that require police intervention. “There have been many instances where people shared actionable inputs via social media and helped resolve certain issues. Some of the common issues are traffic violations and encroachment of pedestrian platforms,” a senior police officer said.

“Hundreds of mobile phones that were reported stolen have been recovered and handed over to the owners last month. The decentralisation of cyber crime units at the police station level has enabled effective investigation of cyber offences, resulting in the seizure of over ₹30 lakh swindled through online scams,” the official said.

Though officials from across the State have been on social media over the last few years, their activity logs went up post-lockdown. They have been sharing personal mobile numbers, requesting people to reach out to them in case of a crisis.

V. Vikraman, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Adyar, who is active on Twitter, said social media was a huge help in gathering information. “Those who are not comfortable meeting a police officer in person are more comfortable sharing details online,” he said.

Tiruvallur SP P. Aravindhan said the leads that come through social media were accurate and hardly misleading. “We get issues pertaining to animal cruelty and transportation of ill-legal cattle, among others. They send us direct messages on Twitter,” he said, adding that a murder case was solved through a tip-off that came through Twitter.

“A girl was murdered and buried. Her brother, from a neighbouring State, informed us that she had gone missing. With his inputs, we tracked the case and arrested those involved,” Mr. Aravindhan said.

In Sivaganga, Superintendent of Police R. Rohith Nathan said a WhatsApp number for people to communicate their grievances had helped. While police stations would remain the hub of the public redressal system, any issue that remained unresolved could be flagged using WhatsApp.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1orc49/article32877261.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16OCTTHCOP-CHENNAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/video-call-grievance-redressal-system-popular-among-people/article32877262.ece

325,2020/10/17,A constitutional pickle of the Andhra kind,"Checks and balances for politicians, bureaucrats and judges are a must as political mudslinging may smear the judiciary

The division of the larger State was a traumatic phase, and troubled times seem not to have left Andhra Pradesh’s people and institutions, caught as they are between warring chieftains Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and N. Chandrababu Naidu. Of special concern now, however, is the latest controversy which threatens to suck in the Indian judiciary at its highest levels. This is embedded in the letter of October 6 written by the State Chief Minister, Jagan Mohan Reddy, to the Chief Justice of India (CJI), S.A. Bobde.

Allegations against a judge

Historical movie buffs will recall an ancient war machine called the catapult. A huge arm was attached to a tall gibbet into which was put shredded nails or molten fire. As the arm swung back and then spun forward, it released its contents across a wide arc into the opposing castle. On landing, it did devastating damage. The king of the castle had to deal with it, and quickly, to contain the damage. The young Chief Minister’s letter evokes this parallel. Except that the target is not the city or the Court, it is one judge — but Justice N.V. Ramana is no ordinary judge; he is now the seniormost after the CJI, and is due to take over from him come April 2021, if the convention on seniority holds.

Editorial | Unpleasant spectacle: On A.P. CM’s complaint against Supreme Court judge

The Chief Minister’s letter begins with a reminder that the executive is an equal partner of the judiciary and the legislature in serving the people. It acknowledges the power of judicial review over acts of the other organs of State, and quickly swings this around to emphasise the consequent need for absolute judicial integrity. The arc thus traversed, the contents are offloaded, and they consist of damning allegations against Justice Ramana.

Reference is made to Justice Ramana’s proximity to former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) as Additional Advocate General, and we are reminded that former Supreme Court justice Justice J. Chelameshwar has commented adversely on their connection.

That Justice Ramana has, through the State Chief Justice, influenced the selection of the roster and allotment of key portfolios to a few judges close to the TDP.

That important matters relating to State policy and TDP interests are posted before these judges and invariably orders adverse to the government are passed.

That even a decision of the Cabinet appointing a Special Investigating Team to investigate allegations of corruption against the previous TDP administration has been stayed by the High Court.

The letter makes mention of cases where the High Court has passed orders negating a slew of key decisions of the Jagan Mohan Reddy government in the last 18 months; presumably, these include shifting the capital out of Amaravati, resolution on the abolition of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council, and removal of State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar, etc.

Gag order as a misstep

The Chief Minister’s missive makes specific and pointed reference to insider knowledge and purchase of large land transactions in Amaravati at old prices to make a killing when the development plans were unveiled. He mentions the involvement of D. Srinivas, previous Advocate General of the State and also makes reference to close relatives of Justice Ramana. It is not possible here to discuss the FIR filed by the government in this case owing to a most unusual order passed by the Chief Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, Justice J.K. Maheshwari on September 15. In the face of Supreme Court precedents, Justice Maheshwari injuncted further investigation of the case. Crucially, he went one step further (and this may be the fatal misstep) and placed a gag order on the media from reporting the FIR.

Now, this goes against every tenet of freedom of speech, the right of the press to properly report on matters of public importance and our right as citizens to receive such reports, and the tenets of transparency and accountability of high constitutional office-holders in a democracy. Indeed, one would like the Andhra Chief Justice to explain to us what the crucial aspect of security of the State or integrity of the country involved in this case of alleged land grab through insider knowledge is that we the citizens should not know about it. It is galling in the extreme that a senior judge should think that after 70 years of constitutional freedom, we will meekly consent to have our mouths gagged and our ears clogged. Sadly, that gag order continues, contrary to expectation that the designated sentinel on the watch, the highest court, would order its immediate extinction on becoming aware of its existence.

Onus is on the CJI

All eyes are now on the CJI to evolve a fair and transparent process which enables Justice Ramana to clear his name; brotherly absolution and Pandora’s boxes will cause damage to both man and institution. And here one may express an anxiety which is dogging us for quite some time about Chief Justices of India falling short of the standards of integrity and probity. The office of the CJI is the most august one — pater familas of the legal system, master of the roster, decisive say in appointment of the next generations of judges — it does not get more powerful. We deserve to get the best CJI we can get.

Wanted, a watchdog

There is pushback against the Andhra Chief Minister, saying that he has levelled these allegations against Justice Ramana because Justice Ramana is speeding up cases of corruption against politicians, and Mr. Jagan Mohan has a slew of cases involving vast amounts of money pending against him. Let us also make it clear that the utmost priority should be given to all such cases; the way to good governance lies through punishment of the corrupt governors, and the more stringent and expeditious this is, the better. Indeed, one wishes for a Leadership Commission which would focus on the measures required to obtain and keep high levels of integrity from our leaders, and that includes not just politicians and bureaucrats, but also judges. And for good measure perhaps, we should also bestow thought on the office of a judicial ombudsman.

326,2020/10/17,"Letters to the Editor — October 17, 2020","Joint fight

It will be a futile and lonely battle for Kashmir’s politicians who want to restore the State’s special status (Page 1, “J&K parties team up for restoring special status”, October 16). Article 370 no longer resonates with the Indian people and its revocation is a fait accompli. The harsh reality they need to consider is that the national mood has shifted towards treating Kashmir as an integral part of India. The redundancy of historical claims is starkly apparent. The viable option before Kashmir’s political class is to swim with the tide of public opinion and work with the Centre to claim the State’s legitimate dues.

V.N. Mukundarajan,

Thiruvananthapuram

That the former Chief Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir are now on one platform to form the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration is a welcome step. Given the rapid pace at which events have unfolded in J&K over the past year, it is easy to forget that the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party have been arch-rivals for over two decades.

Mainstream Kashmiri parties stood against Pakistan-sponsored terror, but always sought, in principle, a degree of autonomy within India. The effective nullification of Article 370 has put an end to these political aspirations. They have found themselves blamed for having ‘surrendered’ to Delhi — the perception on the street — while Delhi’s establishment sees them as untrustworthy. Both parties now recognise that it is only by putting up a joint front that they can extract a renegotiation of Kashmir’s status within India. As they cannot give up their demand for the restoration of Article 370, the other more realistic goal is to ask for statehood. This unity between Kashmir’s democrats is positive, for it allows the Centre to reach a comprehensive accommodation with all. Delhi should start a sincere dialogue to restore normalcy.

GST move

The reported reconciliatory stance of the Centre to break the impasse between the Centre and the States on the ways and means to make up the shortfall in GST owing to economic slowdown during COVID-19 times is welcome (Page 1, “GST: Centre to borrow for States”, October 16). This attitude of appreciation of mutual concerns should continue in the days to come, with continuity in dialogue. It is essential to provide quick relief to the common man who is also the common denominator for both governments. There is no reason not to adopt resolution even when it comes to internal matters. However, it is important to avoid pilferage of money in expenditure incurred either by the Centre or the States when there is heavy shortfall in revenues due to a pandemic.

M.V. Nagavender Rao,

Hyderabad

One wonders why it took so long for this realisation to dawn. It seems that the Centre would borrow the amount and extend it to the States as back-to-back loans to be adjusted against the future shares of the States of GST collections. This could have been agreed upon at the first instance instead of arm-twisting the States.

Kishore Bhimani

In the passing away of Kishore Bhimani, the Indian commentariat has lost a cricket library whose running commentary of Test matches on Doordarshan in the 1970s and 1980s enthralled many a viewer. That he had commentated when the legendary Sunil Gavaskar surpassed 10,000 runs in Test cricket was itself a great honour for Bhimani. Indeed, his passing creates a void in Indian cricket vis-à-vis running commentary.

Notes on cricket

The column, “Lessons from the master for India’s talented youngsters” (‘Between Wickets’, October 14), excelled for these reasons.

Sunil Gavaskar’s keen technical observation of A B de Villiers striking a six. Gavaskar as an expert was no different from his role as a batsman in terms of addiction to perfection. The columnist has beautifully delved into cricket’s virtues containing the Gita’s principles.

Further, the write-up is a subtle explanation of how Gavaskar’s vision for perfection has different meaning in the shorter version where the Gita would not apply. The excellence lies midway where a batsman can adapt to any format without making a compromise to the charm of the game like de Villiers and Kohli do, to name a few.

327,2020/10/17,"‘Mumbai cannot depend on Tata Power, AEML alone’","MSETCL chairman and managing director says the city needs additional sources of electricity to prevent another blackout

Days after a power outage plunged Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region into darkness on October 12, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed Tata Power to immediately hand over land to Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) to set up a 400 kV substation in Vikhroli, a project that has been pending for over a decade now. Dinesh Waghmare, chairman and managing director of Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Co. Ltd. (MSETCL), speaks to The Hindu on what went wrong on October 12.

What led to the power failure?

The problem arose on October 10 when the conductor wire of the Talegaon-Kalwa transmission line snapped at Lonavala and Karjat. As employees were working to repair the line, circuit number one of the Padghe-Kalwa line tripped at 6.54 a.m. on October 12. The maintenance team required stopping power supply to the line to fix the issue. The power load was transferred to circuit number two of the same line, which too tripped due to overload by 9.58 a.m. So the situation was that both the Talegaon-Kalwa line and circuit number two of the Padghe-Kalwa line had snapped, while circuit number one was undergoing maintenance. Meanwhile, at Kharghar substation, high voltage on the Kharghar-Kalwa created a spark. Fearing a fire, the substation incharge manually shut down the lines from Talegaon to Kharghar, and from Kharghar to Kalwa at 10.23 a.m. This led to no power supply to Mumbai as Tata Power and AEML lines tripped simultaneously. Restoration work first started at 10.41 a.m. on circuit number one of the Padhage-Kalwa line followed by Talegaon-Kharghar line, the AEML line, circuit number two of the Padaghe-Kalwa line and Tata Power line. The final restoration of power was completed by 1 a.m. on October 13. Power was restored on priority basis to banks, hospitals, rail services, and government offices.

What was the biggest challenge faced while restoring power?

At Lonavala, the tower is situated on a mountain and at Karjat, it is in a deep valley. Around 100 employees, including engineers, braved the tough terrain, rough weather, wild animals, and worked to finally restore power by Thursday night. Most of them hailed from Jharkhand and had the knowledge of negotiating such terrain. Since ‘generation’ didn’t get restored at the expected time, ‘islanding’ of Mumbai did not happen. Hydropower stations can start generating power in 10 minutes of such a failure, but Tata Power took over five hours. Thermal power stations came on board only past midnight, further delaying the restoration of power to residential areas. Tata Power has a capacity of 1,377 MW, which includes three hydro power units, two coal units and two gas units. Meanwhile, AEML has two units of 250 MW each.

Was it a technical error or is foul play suspected?

MSETCL investigated the incident and prima facie, it is suspected to be a technical error. A report has been submitted and a State-level inquiry might follow. Meanwhile, a Central team visited Mumbai on October 13 and completed their investigation by October 14. The Central team consisted of the chief engineer of the Central Electricity Authority of India along with representatives from the Power Grid Corporation of India, the Western Regional Load Dispatch Centre, Tata Power, AEML and MSETCL.

How can a similar episode be prevented?

Mumbai needs additional sources of electricity. Power should also be brought from outside. The city cannot depend on Tata Power and AEML alone. The Vikhroli substation project had been stalled for a long time, but now the Chief Minister has resolved the land issue. The project was with Tata Power, which they did not implement. Later, through a bidding process, the project was allotted to AEML. Tata Power was supposed to hand over the land to AEML, but Godrej has taken the land on lease and was embroiled in a dispute with the State government. On Friday, the Chief Minister asked Tata Power to hand over the land to AEML at the earliest. Once commissioned, the Vikhroli substation will generate 1,500 MW of power. Another proposed substation between Dahanu and Bhoisar is also stuck due to a land dispute. Once commissioned, this project will also generate 1,500 MW of power. Two more circuits are planned for the Padaghe-Kalwa corridor, but are stalled as many slum and residential areas dot the route. Every industrial and commercial establishment should have provision for battery storage to tackle such emergencies.

How much power does Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region need per day?

During the monsoon season, at the peak hours, the average requirement is 2,700 to 2,900 MW in Mumbai and 3,800 to 4,011 MW in the MMR. Around 50% of power required by Mumbai is provided by MSETCL, while the remaining (around 1,877 MW) is provided by Tata Power and AEML.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ranlly/article32883417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMDinesh-Waghmare,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-cannot-depend-on-tata-power-aeml-alone/article32883418.ece
328,2020/10/17,"Fake TRP case | Republic TV, Arnab Goswamy move Bombay High Court to quash FIR","Petitioners says it is ‘misconceived, politically motivated and frivolous’.

The Republic TV media group filed a criminal petition before the Bombay High Court to quash the FIR registered in the Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation case by the Mumbai Police.

ARG Outlier Media Private Limited and Republic TV chief Arnab Goswami moved the court on October 16 to quash the FIR registered on October 6 and called it, “misconceived, politically motivated and frivolous”.

The company and Mr. Goswami have been charged under Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The petition also seeks a stay on the investigation, and restraining the State; Station House Officer of Kandivali police station; Crime Intelligent Unit; and Commissioner of Police (CP) Param Bir Singh from taking any coercive steps. It also urges the case be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation.

The plea mentions, “The Mumbai police is reportedly investigating the alleged role of certain news channels in connection with the impugned FIR, including the Group which owns and operates the TV news channels, Republic TV and R. Bharat.”

The petitioners state that they had moved the court under extremely urgent circumstances as the CP on October 8 alleged that the group was involved in the alleged fake TRP scam, and the promoters and directors of the group, which included Mr. Goswami, would be summoned in this regard to appear before the investigation team.

On October 9, summons were issued to the chief financial officer, S. Sundaram, and head of the western region distribution Ghanshyam Singh to remain present before Shashank Sandbhor, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Crime Investigation Department, on October 10 for recording their statements in the matter.

Soon thereafter, on October 10, summons were issued to chief executive officer Vikas Khanchandani, chief operating officer Priya Mukharjee, and chief operating officer Hersh Bhandari, to remain present on October 11.

The plea further added that the officers and key managerial persons of the group, and Mr. Goswami, had reasonable and tangible grounds to believe that they would be apprehended by Mumbai police in connection with the impugned FIR, which is “false, frivolous, politically motivated and an attempt to muzzle the media and silence the news reporting by the group.” Hence, the present petition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ghaavi/article32883021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARNAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fake-trp-case-republic-tv-arnab-goswamy-move-bombay-high-court-to-quash-fir/article32883022.ece
329,2020/10/17,"Mumbai court orders probe into complaint against Kangana Ranaut, sister","Their tweets were creating tensions between Hindu and Muslim artistes in film industry, said plea

A magistrate’s court in Mumbai has asked the police to investigate a complaint against Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel for allegedly trying to create tension between communities through their tweets.

Bandra metropolitan magistrate Jaydeo Y. Ghule passed the order on Friday after casting director Sahil Ashrafali Sayyed lodged the complaint seeking registration of an FIR under IPC sections 153A (promoting enmity), 295A (malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings), 124A (sedition) against the actor and her sister, his lawyer Ravish Zamindar said.

In his complaint, Mr. Sayyed said, “Her (Ms. Ranaut’s) tweets are creating divisions between Hindu Artistes and Muslim Artistes. I say that she is maliciously bringing religion in almost all her tweets.” He also said, “She has gone to such an extent that she has also blamed Jamaatis for spreading coronavirus etc. thereby trying to create hatred and communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims deliberately as she is well aware that she is a well known actress and has a big fan base so her tweets will be seen and will reach out to many people.”

The complainant alleged that the actor has been defaming Bollywood since the last two months by calling it a “hub of nepotism”, “favouritism”, etc. through her tweets and television interviews. He added that Ms. Ranaut’s “very objectionable” comments, had not only hurt his religious sentiments, but also the feelings of many artistes.

Mr Sayyed said, “Islam Religion has nothing to do with film business and secondly Ms. Ranaut is trying to create divisions by spreading hate and disharmony in Hindi Film Industry.”

Upon perusal of the documents on record and the lawyer’s submission, the court found that “cognisable offence” has been committed by the accused. Mr Ghule then directed the police station concerned to initiate necessary action and investigation against the actor and her sister under relevant provisions of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

“Total allegations are based upon the comments made on electronic media — Twitter and interviews — and a thorough investigation by an expert is necessary,” the court said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/2dg7ri/article32700496.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMSonamKanGIU7PUIO63jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/court-orders-probe-against-kangana-ranaut-sister-over-tweets/article32880554.ece
330,2020/10/17,‘Pad Squad’ distributes free sanitary pads to economically disadvantaged women,"Actress Taranjit Kaur and producer Chhitra Subramaniam’s initiative to distribute free sanitary pads in Mumbai is catching on in other cities too

When actress Taranjit Kaur and producer Chitra Subramaniam were buying groceries for the needy during the lockdown, one particular item caught their attention: sanitary pad. Menstrual hygiene is already a challenge in India. According to the National Family Health Survey report published in 2017, only 58 % of women of age 15-24 use a hygienic method of menstrual protection. The pandemic restricted access to sanitary pads for economically disadvantaged women. Taranjit and Chitra, hence, decided to address this problem.

The duo, with their friends, started ‘Pad Squad’, an initiative to distribute free sanitary pads in Mumbai. “Initially, we started with just our neighbourhood. But as we posted on social media, more people joined. We received over 10,000 pads in three days,” says Taranjit.

The Pad Squad now has 55 members from over 25 cities. They have distributed over five lakh pads.

Chitra has been to the slums in Shivaji Nagar, Juhu and Ambawadi in Mumbai. “With the lockdown, it was challenging to move around. But you have to go to these places to understand the problems of the people. Each place is a mini world in itself. You need to talk to the women there and explain menstrual hygiene to them.”

Taranjit reckons it’s not a one-shot solution. “You need to revisit these places, to get to know their issues. So, it’s better to identify an area and revisit it instead of providing scattering support.”

For this year’s Daan Utsav, a week-long philanthropy festival, Chitra and Taranjit requested the ‘padsquadders’ to keep in their houses, a ‘pad peti’, a box to collect sanitary pads. “The support was great. We managed to collect over 1.5 lakh pads in that week alone. From a 14-year-old boy to an 80-year-old woman, a lot of people took part in the initiative.”

Pad Squad also has a supporter from Nigeria. Ekemi Inyang, a human rights activist, will devise a similar programme and gather more ‘padsquadders’ in Africa.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1t32rj/article32880456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PadSquad-TaranjitKaurjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pad-squad-distributes-free-sanitary-pads-to-economically-disadvantaged-women/article32880457.ece
331,2020/10/17,Rape case filed against actor Mithun Chakraborty’s son,"Mahaakshay was booked based on a complaint lodged by the 38-year-old woman

Mumbai Police have registered a case against veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty’s son Mahaakshay and the former’s wife Yogita Bali on a complaint of rape and cheating filed by a woman, an official said on Saturday.

The case was registered at Oshiwara police station on Thursday night based on the complaint lodged by the 38-year- old woman, he said.

“The complainant said she was in a relationship with Mahaakshay Chakraborty from 2015 to 2018 and during that period he had promised to marry her,” the official said.

“The woman said that during their relationship, she had gone to see Mahaakshay’sflat at Adarsh Nagar in Andheri West, which he had purchased in 2015. She said when she went there, the accused offered her a spiked soft drink and forced her to have physical relations with him,” he added.

“The woman alleged that when she became pregnant, Mahaakshay asked her to abort the baby and gave her pills,” he said.

“The woman said she used to ask Mahaakshay about their marriage. But in January 2018, he told her that he cannot marry her, which led to an altercation between them. She said when she called him, his mother Yogita Bali threatened her,” the official said.

The complainant later went to Delhi with her brother to stay with their family friend. There, she lodged a complaint against Mahaakshay and his mother Yogita Bali at Begumpur police station in June 2018, he added.

The police had registered an offence under section 376 (rape), 313 (causing miscarriage without woman’s consent) and others, and the probe was transferred to the crime branch there. A Delhi court later granted anticipatory bail to Mahaakshay and his mother in the case.

In March 2020, the Delhi High Court had asked the woman to file her complaint in the court, where the offence had taken place. Following that, she filed a complaint at Oshiwara police station in July this year, the official said.

“Accordingly, an offence under IPC sections 376 (rape), 376 (2) (n) (repeated rape), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), 417 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) has been registered against the accused,” he said, adding that a probe is on.

Mahaakshay has featured in a few films like “Haunted 3D” and “Loot”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/i1pnwa/article24315787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03MIMOH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rape-case-filed-against-actor-mithun-chakrabortys-son/article32879794.ece
332,2020/10/17,Coronavirus | Mumbai airport offers express Covid-19 RT-PCR testing facility for all departing passengers,"They can get themselves tested and produce the negative report to skip institutional quarantine at their destination.

Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) has introduced its express COVID-19 RT-PCR test facility for all passengers departing from the airport.

This facility is also available for non-passengers visiting the airport to drop off or collect their loved ones.

“This initiative addresses passenger concerns regarding the different COVID-19 regulations across domestic and international destinations,” Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), the airport operator said in a statement.

Now departing passengers can undergo the test at CSMIA before travelling to their onward destination and produce their negative test report to skip institutional quarantine at their destination.

Initially launched under the directive from the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) for international transit passengers arriving at the airport , CSMIA has now further extended the availability of the facility for passengers departing from the airport as well.

The facility is located on the curbside of Level 4 at Terminal 2 for departing passenger; non-passengers can also opt to undergo the test at this location.

Departing passengers can make an online booking through the test feature available on www.csmia.aero or register themselves at the helpdesk set up at departures to enroll for the RT-PCR test before entering the terminal and receive a digital copy mailed directly or can also collect the physical copy of the test report within 8 hours.

“Passengers departing from the airport are encouraged to arrive at the terminal 8-12 hours before their scheduled departure,” the statement said.

Since the commemoration of the test facility at the airport, CSMIA has witnessed a total of over 3340 passengers who opted for the test.

The testing facility at the airport registers an average of 100 tests per day.

Out of the tests conducted at the airport till date, 38 passengers have tested positive for Covid-19 and were transferred by State authorities to designated COVID-19 institutions.

Additionally, the RT-PCR testing at the airport is the fastest test facility in the city of Mumbai.

“With test facilities now available at both departures and arrivals at the airport, passengers can easily transit to and from CSMIA with comfort,” MIAL said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/eeehtk/article32484476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMUMBAIAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-airport-offers-express-covid-19-rt-pcr-test-facility-for-all-departing-passengers/article32879645.ece
333,2020/10/17,NDRF units to stay stationed in worst-hit areas,"State govt. urged to provide immediate relief of ₹20,000 per acre to farmers

With western Maharashtra and Marathwada acutely hit by intense showers of the retreating monsoon, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said that teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) would be stationed in Pandharpur, Solapur and Baramati for the next few days in anticipation of more heavy rainfall.

Urging Pune division authorities to remain vigilant for the possibility of more showers in the next 48 hours, Mr. Pawar directed them to conduct an immediate inquiry into the massive crop damage suffered by farmers owing to the retreating monsoon. He also asked them to assess the damage to houses and other property in Solapur, Pune and other districts as well.

“The administration must ensure that basic facilities are provided to all stranded citizens. Officials must take immediate action to restore the lives of the citizens in the worst-hit areas like Solapur, Pandharpur, and Baramati among others,” said Mr. Pawar, while reviewing the excess rainfall situation with authorities from the administration as well as elected representatives.

According to authorities, more than 40,000 persons from 10,000 families in the Pune division (which comprises Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur districts) have been evacuated to safer zones, while 29 pople, of whom eight are missing, have lost their lives till now. More than 1,000 livestock have died, swept away by the floodwaters, while more than 87,000 hectares of crop land have been afflicted in the division.

In Pune, the situation is particularly grim for farmers in Baramati, Daund, Junnar and Ambegaon tehsils, where the departing rains have ravaged thousands of hectares of paddy, pulses, potato and other crops.

In Latur district in Marathwada, the estimated losses are even more severe with 2.10 lakh hectares of kharif crops, particularly soybean, having been destroyed by unrelenting showers.

Farmer leader and All-India Kisan Sabha State Secretary Dr. Ajit Nawale said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government should announce an immediate relief of ₹20,000 per acre to farmers.

“Instead of waiting for the long panchnama process (to assess losses incurred by a farmer), the Revenue Department authorities must immediately give an aid of ₹20,000 per acre to farmers,” said Dr. Nawale.

While there was a relative lull in the rains on Friday, a number of villages in Solapur and Sangli districts continued to be half-submerged in water. In Sangli city, rainwater entered more than 3,000 houses.

Meanwhile, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana chief Raju Shetti also demanded substantial primary aid to farmers while remarking that if the State government failed to do so, then farmers would have no choice but to borrow loans at high interest rates from private moneylenders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ndrf-units-to-stay-stationed-in-worst-hit-areas/article32876820.ece

336,2020/10/17,New research sheds light on declining star formation in Milky Way,"Astronomers use upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to glean vital clues

In a vital discovery which may help understand the mystery behind declining star formation activity in the Milky Way, a team of astronomers from the Pune-based National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA-TIFR) and Raman Research Institute (RRI) in Bengaluru have used the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to measure the atomic hydrogen content of galaxies seen as they were eight billion years ago when the universe was young.

The research, carried out by Aditya Chowdhury, noted astrophysicist Nissim Kanekar, and Jayaram Chengalur of NCRA-TIFR, and Shiv Sethi, and K. S. Dwarakanath of RRI, has been published in the October 15 issue of the prestigious British scientific journal Nature.

Explaining the importance behind the research, Mr. Chowdhury, a PhD scholar at NCRA-TIFR and the lead author of the study, said galaxies in the universe are made up mostly of gas and stars, with gas being converted into stars during the life of a galaxy.

“Understanding galaxies requires us to determine how the amounts of both gas and stars change with time. Astronomers have long known that galaxies formed stars at a higher rate when the universe was young than they do today. The star formation activity in galaxies peaked about 8-10 billion years ago and has been declining steadily till today,” Mr. Chowdhury said.

Unlocking the mystery

He observed that the cause of this decline was unknown as there had been no information regarding the amount of atomic hydrogen gas — the primary fuel for star formation — in galaxies in these early times.

“We have, for the first time, measured the atomic hydrogen gas content of star forming galaxies about 8 billion years ago, using the upgraded GMRT. Given the intense star formation in these early galaxies, their atomic gas would be consumed by star formation in just one or two billion years. And, if the galaxies could not acquire more gas, their star formation activity would decline, and finally cease”, said Mr. Chowdhury, adding that the observed decline in star formation activity could thus be explained by the exhaustion of the atomic hydrogen.

The measurement of the atomic hydrogen mass of distant galaxies was done by using the upgraded GMRT to search for a spectral line in atomic hydrogen.

Unlike stars which emit light strongly at optical wavelengths, the atomic hydrogen signal lies in the radio wavelengths, at a wavelength of 21 cm, and can only be detected with radio telescopes.

Commenting on the measurements taken using the upgraded GMRT, Mr. Kanekar said, “Unfortunately, this 21 cm signal is intrinsically very weak, and difficult to detect from distant individual galaxies even with powerful telescopes like the upgraded GMRT. To overcome this limitation, the team used a technique called “stacking” to combine the 21 cm signals of nearly 8,000 galaxies that had earlier been identified with the help of optical telescopes. This method measures the average gas content of these galaxies.”

Mr. Kanekar said studying the distant universe through the 21 cm signal has remained an important research area in astronomy, and one of the key science goals of the GMRT.

Mr. Chengalur said the big jump in sensitivity was due to the upgrade of the GMRT in 2017. “The new wide band receivers and electronics allowed us to use 10 times more galaxies [8,000 galaxies were observed in the study] in the stacking analysis, giving sufficient sensitivity to detect the weak average 21 cm signal.”

Detecting the 21 cm signal from the most distant galaxies in the universe was the main science goal of the GMRT, when it was designed and built by a team led by the late pioneering astrophysicist Govind Swarup in the 1980s and 1990s.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6qp3au/article32876780.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BMGMRT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/new-research-sheds-light-on-declining-star-formation-in-milky-way/article32876781.ece

339,2020/10/17,"Signs of recovery, but challenges remain in real estate","Both launches and sales grew in Q3 of 2020 after the lockdown began to ease, with residential market doing better than expected. By M.A. Siraj

There is hint in the air that the realty market is showing signs of recovery. Knight Frank’s ‘India Realty Report’ for Q3 (July – September 2020) says sales and supplies that plummeted during Q2, a period coinciding with complete lockdown of the economy, have shown upswing during the Q3 period. The report, that focuses on top eight cities across the country, points out that launches grew by four-and-a-half times and sales by two-and-a-half times compared to Q2 of 2020. The residential market has displayed a better than expected recovery in Q3, given the macro-economic challenges and resumption of lockdown in July that impacted every sector of the economy.

Shishir Baijal, GM, Knight Frank, while releasing the report on a zoom platform, said, the bounce back in the quarter is promising, though the sector is still not out of the woods. While the sale of home units showed a 247% rise on a quarter-to-quarter (QoQ) basis the launches were up by 45 per cent. Mumbai witnessed the largest rise during September, largely attributed to 300 bps cut in stamp duty by the Maharashtra government. Mr. Baijal said the recent successes by REITs and entry of new players in the field serve as an index of long-term confidence of investors for office space.

Though the decline of demand due to general reluctance to buy homes has been the hallmark of the year, the residential sector was also impacted by liquidity crunch, supply chain disruptions, rise of the costs of construction material and large scale exodus of labourers from urban areas. However, the demand showed picking up in Q3 mainly due to fall in residential prices, aggressive marketing of ready inventory and offer of freebies and discounts. Fall in home loan rates, lowest in several decades,extension of moratorium on loan instalments and partial return of construction workers also helped.

The report notes that weighted average prices went down in the range of 3-7% in six of the eight cities in the reckoning during the period. Bengaluru and Hyderabad were the only markets that saw prices grow on year-on-year (YoY) basis as these were predominantly end-user markets.

Decline in inventory

Homebuyers preferred ready or near-ready inventory to minimise completion risk which reflected in the average age of inventory staying at 16.9 quarters in Q3 2020 compared to 16.2 quarters a year ago. Developers also were noticeably keen to liquidate older inventory before new launches. Inventory level levels decreased from 0.44 mn units in Q3 2020, 1% less than a year ago. The sector eyes the festival season in the next quarter as developers expect some fillip to sales. The near-term outlook on sales continues to remain challenging and depends completely on how the pandemic impacts the economy in the months ahead.

Office market

The Indian office market was adversely affected due to the fallout of the COVID-induced lockdown during the last six months. Most of the eight principal markets were under severe lockdown during the period leading to sharp decline in transactions as well as new completions. Businesses deferred expansions, focus shifted to controlling costs, social distancing norms and remote working ensured that corporate offices were working at 30 to 50% capacity in most cities. However, with the unlocking of the economy since July 2020, the market traction has started to improve in tandem as total transactions and office completion have recovered by 80% and 126% respectively, in Q3 in comparison to the preceding quarter, the report notes. Transactions exceeded new completions during this period and helped keep rental levels flat or positive in four of the eight markets under coverage, while rentals fell in the range of 1-6% in rest of the markets.

Rajani Sinha, National Director (Research) said while work from home as a concept has proved to be an effective business continuity measure, the occupiers are expected to look at office space usage more strategically by bringing further innovation to include aspects like social distancing, health benefits and sustainability.

Chief Economist Gulam Zia pointed out that bottlenecks are easing during the lockdown and the RERA authorities have shown flexibility by extending the deadline for completion.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/pr38dw/article32882999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGPHOSUE2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/signs-of-recovery-but-challenges-remain-in-real-estate/article32882989.ece
340,2020/10/17,Khammam rape victim’s death sparks outrage,"Activists demand speedy justice for minor Dalit girl

Amid an outpouring of anguish, the last rites of the 13-year-old Dalit girl, who died on Thursday night while receiving treatment for her burn injuries at a private hospital in Hyderabad, were performed at her native village Pallegudem near here on Friday afternoon. Nearly four weeks ago, she was set ablaze by a 25-year-old married man when she resisted his alleged rape attempt at his house here.

The victim, who worked as a domestic help at the house of the accused Allam Maraiah of Mustafanagar here, suffered around 70% burns after the latter allegedly poured petrol on her before setting her ablaze after a failed rape attempt on September 18.

In view of the closure of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the poor parents of the girl sent her, their second daughter, to Khammam to work as a domestic help, sources close to the victim’s family said.

The gruesome incident came to light around 15 days after the actual crime, as the accused, who hails from the same community as the victim, admitted her to a local private hospital clandestinely and resorted to intimidating tactics.

For nearly a fortnight, the girl suffered in silence at the private hospital, the management of which treated the injured girl in the regular ward.

The incident came to the fore belatedly on October 5, after a video clip showing the bed-ridden girl narrating her heart-wrenching ordeal went viral on social media.

Following public outcry, the authorities shifted the girl to Osmania General Hospital in Hyderabad on the same day, and a few days later moved her to a private hospital in the State capital for better treatment.

The district health authorities sealed Sri Pooja Hospital in Khammam on October 8 for failing to inform the police about the medico-legal case.

The Khammam 1 town police booked Maraiah under the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, and other relevant Sections of the IPC on October 5. He was remanded to judicial custody for two weeks.

The body of the victim was brought to Pallegudem from Hyderabad amid tight security arrangements on Friday. Tension prevailed in the village later in the day when activists of women’s organisations staged a demonstration with the body of the victim at the burial ground. They raised slogans demanding a speedy trial inthe horrific case and harshest punishment for the accused.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-assembly/iw54m0/article32878539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16KHAMMAM,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-assembly/khammam-rape-victims-death-sparks-outrage/article32878540.ece
341,2020/10/17,Coronavirus | Three high school students test positive in Puducherry,"Director of School Education P.T. Rudra Goud told The Hindu that all the three were asymptomatic when they attended school.

Three students tested positive for COVID-19 after the government decided to allow partial resumption of academic activities in high schools in Puducherry.

A class 10 student of Annai Sarada Devi Government High School at Vadhanur in Mannadipet constituency tested positive for the virus on Friday taking the total number of students who got infected to three since the Education Department allowed children in higher classes to visit the premises to get their doubts cleared and seek guidance from teachers.

Healthcare workers disinfected the premises and closed the particular section where the student attended the class.

Earlier, two children studying in Jeevanandam Government Higher Secondary School and Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Kalapet tested positive for the virus.

Director of School Education P.T. Rudra Goud told The Hindu that all the three were asymptomatic when they attended school. “All three have undergone screening using thermal scanner but did not show any sign of fever as they were asymptomatic,” he said.

Recently, a student of Manimegalai Government Girls Higher Secondary School, who showed signs of fever during screening, was sent back home, he said.

“We are taking all care so that schools don’t become a place for the spread of virus. Our teams are visiting each and every school to check whether the authorities are following the guidelines,” he said.

MLA protests

Meanwhile, AINRC MLA T.P.R. Selvam, who represents Mannadipet constituency, held a protest at Vadhanur Government School on Saturday morning after authorities decided to conduct classes after closing it for a day on Friday.

He asked the students to return home.

Mr. Selvam said he would organise a protest again on Monday if the school continued to function.

The usually vibrant art and culture scene, one of the distinctive features of life in the city, is reviving amid the new normal set by the COVID-19 pandemic.

A group show, themed “Lockdown Diaries” featuring 32 paintings by 10 artists, that is on at the Maison Perumal marks the first art event in the city since the March lockdown.

Dismal mood

The exhibits include works in acrylic on canvas, watercolours and linocut on paper.

Some of the exhibits capture the dismal mood during the pandemic, the shutdown of normal life, the pain and suffering and the large-scale migration of workers.

The frames capture a range of emotions between either end of the spectrum, from the haze of an uncertain future to hope and optimism for life beyond COVID-19.

Artists have applauded the heroes in the times of the pandemic, from front-line healthcare professionals to farmers and transportation workers.

“A supportive space has been a feature of our hospitality experience. So, we wanted a painting show when we reopened recently to mark our return to the new normal,” said Sam John, manager of the heritage property in the Tamil Quarter of town.

More than anything else, the event was organised to encourage artistic endeavour in these tough times, he said.

There was been an uptick in guests, primarily from Chennai and Bengaluru, and many of them came down to break the shackles, Mr. John said.

Dutch artist Dikkenberg, who has come down to visit his uncle in Auroville, has brought to the show a few interesting works.

‘Pro-corona ideal’

“Guitar Girl” depicts a girl with a guitar against the backdrop of buildings in Edingbourgh, his last holiday destination, in an attempt to “nostalgically depict the pre-corona western ideal.”

In ‘The Pauw’ (peacock) the artist portrays the experience of sighting the bird during a visit to Auroville while ‘The Schildpad’ has a tortoise crawling across a fantasy landscape.

Meanwhile, Alliance Francaise recently hosted an online book launch of French writer and academic Erik Orsenna’s Pasteur, la vie, la mort (Pasteur, Life, Death and Beyond) on its website and social media networks.

344,2020/10/17,Law varsity V-C wins case against Pondicherry University,"HC upholds plea that GPF is applicable to him

Tamil Nadu Dr. Ambedkar Law University Vice-Chancellor T.S.N. Sastry has won a case against his former employer Pondicherry University.

The Madras High Court has held that he should be considered as having been covered under General Provident Fund (GPF) and not Contributory Provident Fund (CPF) scheme ever since he joined service as a lecturer in 1986.

Justice V. Parthiban expressed his strong displeasure over the way in which the administration of Pondicherry University had been handling petitioner’s claim of being covered under GPF scheme. “The university probably has an axe to grind against the petitioner for some reason which can be inferred from the obdurate and relentless stand taken by it against him,” he said.

The judge pointed out that pursuant to the Fourth Pay Commission recommendations, the government had decided to cover all new appointees after January 1, 1986, under GPF. Only the then existing employees were given the option of choosing between GPF or CPF. Since Mr. Sastry was appointed in November 1986, he would automatically get covered only under GPF.

However, for some reason, the Pondicherry University considered him to be covered under CPF and maintained that stand all through though he had raosed the issue with the varsity even after joining Savitribai Phule Pune University and then shifting to his current position.

“The professed stand taken by Pondicherry University consistently all along denying the benefit of GPF Scheme to the petitioner appears to be a little strange and incomprehensible for the reason that the first respondent university has never established that it had CPF scheme in place even after January 1, 1986 in respect of staff who were appointed fresh,” the judge said.

Further, since GPF was made mandatory for all new appointees after January 1, 1986, the question of Mr. Sastry having opted to be in CPF would not arise at all, the judge pointed out. “This court finds that Pondicherry University’s understanding that the petitioner had exercised his option to the CPF scheme was fundamentally flawed and premised on erroneous perspective,” he observed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/krmouv/article32857506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THHC2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/law-varsity-v-c-wins-case-against-pondicherry-university/article32877233.ece
345,2020/10/17,"Gold smuggling | Swapna, Sarith charged with FEMA violation","Investigating agency yet to disclose if Principal Secretary is part of chargesheet.

The Customs Department has filed a case before the Economic Offences Court, Ernakulam, against Swapna Suresh and P. S. Sarith, the key accused in the gold smuggling case for violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).

The case has been filed based on the inference that the accused had abetted smuggling of foreign currency from the country with the help of her consulate identity card. Both Ms. Swapna and Mr. Sarith were former employees of the UAE Consulate in Thiruvananthapuram.

The court is likely to consider the application moved by the Customs to arrest the accused on Monday. The investigating team was tight-lipped on whether they have included M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, as an accused in the case.

The Customs, in a recent petition filed before a court in Kochi, had claimed that around $1.9 lakh had been taken out of the country with the help of Swapna. The illegal transportation of currency via aiport comes under FEMA and it allows the Customs to register a case under section 11 of the Customs Act.

The report said that Ms. Swapna helped and abetted illegal transportation of $1.9 lakh abroad taking advantage of the identity card issued by the consulate. The Customs had found that she received help from a carrier to transport the cash to UAE.

The Department had also come across evidence of an employee of UAFX Solutions, a money exchange company, helping Swapna to convert around $65,000 currency on various occasions in 2018 and 2019 in violation of the RBI norms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/e1juu5/article32798555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th07-devesh-ED-G5V7R8AQG3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/gold-smuggling-swapna-sarith-charged-with-fema-violation/article32880668.ece

Of the new cases reported, local transmission accounted for 400 cases. In 182 cases, the source of infection could not be immediately ascertained by health officials. A total of 780 people recovered from the illness.

The district registered five deaths on Friday. The deceased are a 56-year-old woman from Kanjirampara, a 48-year-old woman and a 71-year-old man from Manacaud, an 80-year-old woman from Jagathy, and an 84-year-old woman from Vallakkadavu.

347,2020/10/17,Demand for stoppage of express trains at Tiruverumbur station,"The travelling public in Tiruverumbur, Thuvakudi, BHEL Township and residential localities in surrounding areas anticipate stoppage of express trains at Tiruverumbur railway station in the new time table to be announced before December.

The long-felt demand for stoppage of express trains gained more attention after Tiruverumbur station was accorded Adarsh status in the 2012 Union Budget. The hopes of the travelling public that express trains will have stoppage at the station after completion of modernisation work have been belied.

Only passenger trains continue to have stoppages at the station. Stoppage for express trains will obviate the need for thousands of rail passengers to travel up to Tiruchi junction to board long-distance trains bound for destinations such as Cochin and Chennai. Barring Jan Shatabdi, there are eight pairs of express trains that do not stop at the station.

Although operation of several trains have been suspended now due to lockdown, there is no doubt that passenger patronage will be overwhelming at the station once services are restored, said N. Anbalagan, president, Tamil Nadu Makkal Valarchi Kuzhu.

The organisation has been in the forefront in mobilising public opinion on the issue.

“We have been highlighting the demand for long. A representation was made to the Divisional Railway Manager of Tiruchi Division, and we have also reached out to the Railways Minister. There has been no update so far,” said Tiruverumbur MLA Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi.

The benefits of electrification on Tiruchi-Thanjavur stretch can be optimised effectively by sanctioning stoppage for express trains at Tiruverumbur station. Traffic congestion on the road can be lessened to a significant extent, according to regular passengers in the sector.

Votaries of stoppage of express trains in the Adarsh station emphasise that contemplation by the Railway Ministry for arriving at ‘zero-based’ time table, implying revision of timings for reducing number of halts in order to bring down the travel time must not allowed to become a hampering factor.

Nevertheless, the positive aspect in it is that the demand, utility of passengers and commercial viability are considered for sanctioning stoppages, according to an official.

One of the aspects of the initiative for ‘zero-based’ time table is the gradual introduction of the ‘hub and spoke concept’ with a view to facilitating easy transfers between ‘hubs’ and ‘spokes’ and inter-modal connectivity.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/689vfo/article32883239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY18-TIRUVERUMBURRAILWAYSTATION03,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/demand-for-stoppage-of-express-trains-at-tiruverumbur-station/article32883240.ece

The remark came when reporters brought the attention of the Minister, who was at Kuruvadipatti DPC, to a complaint that adoption of the system delayed the procurement process.

Stating that such system was not implemented in delta districts, where 826 DPCs had been opened for procurement of kuruvai paddy from farmers, Mr. Kamaraj added that additional centres would be opened if needed.

In order to expedite the process, the government had instructed Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation to increase the number of bags of procurement in a day at a DPC from 800 to 1,000 whenever the inflow of grains was high. As on date, the Corporation had procured 2.10 lakh tonnes of kuruvai paddy through 876 DPCs opened in the State.

Sufficient number of tarpaulin sheets had been made available at all DPCs to protect the procured paddy from rain and infrastructure have been created to ensure safe storage. The total storage capacity had been increased to 23 lakh metric tonnes from 11 metric tonnes in 2011, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tfjcmi/article32882856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY18-DPC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/no-token-system-for-procurement-minister/article32881813.ece

352,2020/10/17,"Rail passengers found carrying silver anklets weighing 57 kg, detained in Tiruchi","The two passengers subsequently paid tax, and a penalty, amounting to ₹2.12 lakh and were let off

Two passengers who were found carrying about 57 kilograms of silver anklets without any bill or documents in their possession at Tiruchi railway junction, were detained by Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel on Friday.

The duo S. Sakthivel (25) and V. Aravind (27) both from Salem district came to the railway station on Friday afternoon to board the Tiruchi-Howrah special train. An RPF Constable attached to the Bomb Detection Squad subjected the bags carried by the duo to an examination, at the luggage scanner at the station, and found silver anklets in each one of the three bags.

The constable enquired with the duo and ascertained their identities. As the passengers did not have any bill, voucher or relevant documents in their possession for the valuables carried by them, the RPF constable immediately informed his superiors, said RPF sources. The two, along with their bags containing silver anklets, were taken to the RPF post at Tiruchi Junction for further inquiries.

354,2020/10/17,Bala Devi hopes to live up to expectations,"Wants to make India proud in the Scottish Women’s Premier League

India captain Bala Devi feels the professional training she has received at Rangers FC has made her a better player and she is hopeful of living up to the expectations in the Scottish Women’s Premier League beginning on Sunday.

Bala, who signed a landmark 18-month contract with Rangers in January, said after six weeks of intensive pre-season training, she is raring to go in the league which will be played behind close doors.

Rangers open its campaign at home against Hearts Women on the first day.

“We have had six weeks of training and it is intensive stuff, quite different from what we had in India, obviously much more professional stuff,” she told PTI in an interview from Glasgow.

“I like the training style, our head coach is very clear while giving instructions and I have learnt a lot in these few months here.

“I am fully fit physically and in best frame of mind. So, I am raring to go,” said the 30-year-old forward, who is the first Indian to join a top flight club in Europe.

Bala made her India debut in 2005 and since 2010, has played 58 matches for the country, scoring 52 goals.

Fast-paced

The trailblazing Indian said her experience of playing international football for so long has helped her adjust to the condition and playing style in Rangers, which is fast-paced and high tempo.

“It is very intensive while training as well as during actual match. It is fast-paced and always running on and off the ball.

“So, you have to be extremely fit. I think I have adapted to the system.

“I am not facing any problem. My experience of playing for India for 15 years has helped me doing all these. Things are going on well here for me. And I hope to do my best here so that many a talented players in India follow me in the coming years.”

Instil confidence

“I want to make India proud, hopefully perform well here to instil confidence to those talented girls back home that they can play outside the country. They should not stop dreaming about playing abroad.”

The Manipuri player from Irengbam, a small village in Bishnupur district, said it is a matter of time before more Indian women start playing abroad.

“There are many talented players in the country and I feel in the next two-three years, they will start coming out of India to play football. That will change the women’s game in the country.”

“We are 55th in the world (in FIFA ranking) and that is not bad. We can improve further in the next few years.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/h83ueb/article32883011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18BALA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/bala-devi-hopes-to-live-up-to-expectations/article32883012.ece
355,2020/10/17,Stalemate in bruising Merseyside derby,"VAR denies Liverpool; Chelsea blows handsome lead; Napoli runs riot

Champion Liverpool was foiled by VAR as it was held to a 2-2 Premier League derby draw with Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday after a late effort from Jordan Henderson was ruled out.

Everton remained top of the table on 13 points, three ahead of Liverpool, after an incident-packed end to the 237th Merseyside derby.

The game was locked at 2-2 after Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s 10th goal of the season in all competitions had brought Everton level in the 81st minute.

But in stoppage time, Thiago Alcantara found Sadio Mane with a clever pass and the Senagalese’s low cross was turned in by Henderson, only for VAR to find the narrowest of offsides.

To add to Liverpool’s disappointment, it suffered an injury to key defender Virgil van Dijk, which forced the Dutchman out of the game in the 11th minute, after a reckless challenge from Everton keeper Jordan Pickford.

Everton’s Brazilian forward Richarlison was sent off in the 90th minute after a wild challenge on Thiago Alcantara.

Then came the VAR drama that left Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp bemused. “I’ve seen the disallowed goal at the end and in the picture I saw it wasn’t offside. Can someone explain that to me?” the German said.

Later Chelsea was two goals to the good after early strikes by Timo Werner but still allowed Southampton to claw back to a 3-3 draw. It was up 3-1 after Kai Havertz scored but Danny Ings, Che Adams and Jannik Vestergaard ensured the points were shared.

Napoli blasted four goals in a devastating 20-minute first half spell as it thumped Atalanta 4-1 in Serie A on Saturday, handing the visitor a taste of its own medicine.

The results: Premier League: Everton 2 (Keane 19, Calvert-Lewin 81) drew with Liverpool 2 (Mane 3, Salah 72); Chelsea 3 (Werner 15, 28, Havertz 59) drew with Southampton 3 (Ings 43, Adams 57, Vestergaard 90+2).

LaLiga: Granada 1 (Herrera 82) bt Sevilla 0.

Serie A: Napoli 4 (Lozano 23, 27, Politano 30, Osimhen 43) bt Atalanta 1 (Lammers 59).

Bundesliga: Hoffenheim 0 lost to Borussia Dortmund 1 (Reus 76); Freiburg 1 (Lienhart 15) drew with Werder Bremen 1 (Fuellkrug 25-pen); Hertha Berlin 0 lost to Stuttgart 2 (Kempf 9, Castro 68); Mainz 0 lost to Bayer Leverkusen 1 (Alario 30); Augsburg 0 lost to RB Leipzig 2 (Angelino 45, Poulsen 66).",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/f19irk/article32882579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18FOOT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/stalemate-in-bruising-merseyside-derby/article32882580.ece

Joint Collector M. Venugopala Reddy has expressed dissatisfaction over the functioning of rythu bazaars in the city.

Describing Visakhapatnam as a metro city, he said that the facilities should be on par with other metro cities. He warned of action against officials, who were negligent in discharge of their duties or were not punctual.

Mr. Venugopala Reddy directed the officials to issue a show-cause notice to the Estate Officer of MVP Rythu Bazaar for the deficiencies, he had noticed during his inspection of the bazaar earlier in the morning. A complaint box and register should be maintained at the rythu bazaars and genuine complaints should be promptly attended. There should be separate entry and exit for vehicle at the rythu bazaars.

Referring to rythu cards, the Joint Collector said that new cards should be issued, based on the certificate issued by the Agriculture Assistant at the Village Secretariat or the Horticulture Assistant.

360,2020/10/17,Bumpy ride: city roads take a beating after heavy rains,"Two-wheeler riders worry about their safety; ongoing works add to woes

After the city experienced some good rains over the last few days due the deep depression, the condition of many roads in the city have taken a beating.

Potholes opened up and negotiating the roads have become difficult. While more number of roads are damaged due to the rains, the ongoing works of electricity department, water supply and a few others have added to the woes.

Though most of the potholes were repaired last year under the civic body limits, many have opened up again. Not just the interior areas, even a number of potholes have surfaced on the NH-16, Venkojipalem to Hanumanthawaka road, Akkayyapalem, NAD Junction, Gajuwaka and a few, which seems to be causing problems for the motorists, as chances of skidding and falling down from two-wheelers have increased.

“Once the road is dug out, it is not laid again immediately. Leaving stones, sand on the road without clearing it properly are leading to skidding of bikes. When it rains, it is better not to use some roads. I slipped off after applying brakes as roads were dug out near Daspalla Hills,” said B.J.V. Mahesh, who works in a telecommunications company.

S. Ravi Kiran, a resident of MVP Colony, said that the road from Appughar to MVP Colony is in a very bad condition. Despite bringing it to the notice of officials many times in social media, none of them responded.

M. Satyanarayana, a resident of Akkayyapalem, said that a number of roads near Shankaramatam, Gurudwara, Akkayyapalem are also in a bad shape.

‘Sudden brakes’

“Auto-rickshaw drivers are taking sharp turns or applying sudden brakes when they notice a pothole. We had a lucky escape yesterday by applying sudden brakes near Port Stadium at Akkayyapalem,” said Sheikh Faridha, a resident of Murali Nagar area.

P. Vasu, an auto-rickshaw driver, said that they suffer the most due to the bad road conditions. “Our vehicles are getting damaged frequently,” he said.

Senior citizens above 60 years of age and children below 6 years will not be allowed in view of COVID-19 protocol,” Sri Kanaka Mahalakshmi temple Executive Officer S. Jyothi Madhavi said on Friday.

Elaborate arrangements were made at Sri Sarada Peetham at China Mushidiwada in Pendurthi as a number of people are expected to visit the peetham during the nine-day festival.

Swami Swaroopanandendra Saraswati and Sri Swatmanandendra Saraswati will perform ‘abhishekam’ to the presiding deity of Rajasyamala temple on the peetham premises.

363,2020/10/17,Words have wings: The afterlife of literary works,"Literary works are reborn each time they travel across languages and cultures

As a nerdish 15-year old, I had once won a huge round of applause in a quiz contest when I replied correctly to a question about the connection between Vikram Seth and Alexander Pushkin. It’s old hat now that Seth’s The Golden Gate was inspired by Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin (a translation actually, since Seth did not read Russian). Both works are novels in verse written in 14-line stanzas. Pushkin’s work, set in the early 1800s, helped Seth find his voice and form for the 1980s’ Californian story he wished to tell. Such cross-pollination of ideas is not rare in literature.

The sonnet’s journey

Five centuries ago, the sonnet travelled from medieval Italian to English. Reportedly invented by Giacomo da Lentini, senior poet of the Sicilian school and a notary in the court of the Holy Roman emperor, Frederick II, the sonnet travelled from Sicily to Tuscany, where Dante and Petrarch perfected it.

Petrarch’s English translator, Thomas Wyatt (1503-42), who wanted to give English the literary refinement of other European languages, experimented with the form. His fellow-traveller in this endeavour was the brash Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (1516/17-47), who fell foul of King Henry VIII and was executed. While Wyatt introduced the sonnet form to English, it was Surrey who gave it the rhyming scheme of three quatrains and a final couplet that is its recognisable characteristic.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

In later years, Shakespeare, Spenser and the Romantic poets made the form their own. The form has survived, with poets of all persuasions using it freely.

A more recent journey has been that of the haiku. Originally a short poem in Japanese consisting of 17 on (loosely corresponding to ‘syllables’) in three lines of 5,7 and 5, the haiku was first called hokku, its current name becoming popular at the turn of the 20th century. Among its foremost Japanese practitioners are Matsuo Basho (1644-94) and Kobayashi Issa (1763-1828).

The haiku captured the imagination of the English-speaking world when books on Japanese literature detailing its forms and authors began to appear in the late 1890s. The Imagists, particularly Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell, tried their hand at the form. In later years, R.H. Blyth (1898-1964), who popularised Japanese culture in the West, published many haiku in translation, which inspired writers of the Beat generation like Gary Snyder and Jack Kerouac.

Since then, the haiku has become an established form in English. Indian poet Rochelle Potkar’s collection, Paper Asylum, published in 2018, is a bunch of haibun, also a Japanese form that combines prose passages with haiku.

Not so novel

It is widely believed that Banabhatta’s Kadambari, a Sanskrit work of the 7th century, is India’s (perhaps even the world’s) first novel. But historians think of the novel as a Western creation that became popular with the introduction of printing technology, which made it possible for books to be mass produced, thus enabling middle-class readers to own (or borrow) their own copy.

Kadambari apart, it is only in the 19th century that the novel made its proper appearance in Indian languages: many early Indian novels were, by the authors’ admission, inspired by English ones.

Rajasekhara Charitramu by Kandukuri Veeresalingam Pantulu, often considered the first Telugu novel, was modelled after Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield. It was published in 1878.

Similarly, the early Malayalam novel, Indulekha (1889), by O. Chandu Menon, was modelled after Benjamin Disraeli’s Henrietta Temple. Menon had wanted to translate it but did not do so thinking that Malayalee readers may not be able to relate to it; his novel written in Malayalam was a smash hit.

A high note

To come back to poetry, another cross-cultural literary journey has begun in recent years.

The late Indian-American poet Agha Shahid Ali (1949-2001) had attempted to render ghazals in English, and not just through translation, though he had attempted that too. Ali’s final collection, Call Me Ishmael Tonight, published posthumously in 2003, is subtitled ‘A Book of Ghazals’.

In its original Urdu form, the ghazal consists of rhymed couplets with a phrase at the end of the second line that occurs subsequently in all the couplets that follow. The English form, at least in Ali’s renderings, loses none of the original form’s characteristic melancholy and longing. Adrienne Rich and W.S. Merwin have also published English ghazals.

To end on a high note, Harivansh Rai Bachchan’s Madhushala (1935), which uses alcohol as a metaphor for freedom, was inspired by Omar Khayyam’s Rubaiyat, which Bachchan had earlier translated into Hindi.

364,2020/10/17,Doubtful daughter: Review of Revathi Suresh’s ‘In Now & Then’,"The heroine is moody, prickly, annoying, but you root for her

You’re telling me I should have made an appointment to see you?” I winced at this line in Revathi Suresh’s second novel, In Now and Then. It’s exactly what I used to say to my busy parents when I wanted to push buttons. Speaking of which, Suresh’s protagonist Kavya, whom we first met in Jobless Clueless Reckless, could give anyone lessons in pushing buttons.

If her life seemed to be spinning out of control in the first book, here she stumbles from one crisis to another. At first glance, Kavya is not a very likeable character. She’s moody, prickly and often downright annoying, but Suresh keeps one interested in her. Why is she the way she is? What makes her tick?

The narration is in the first person, but it’s almost as if Kavya is showing the reader only what she wants and hiding a lot more. You want to get into Kavya’s head and understand what’s going on in there.

Broken families and relationships, sex and sexual identities (written in a matter-of-fact and non-judgemental manner), modes of education, sorrow... everything here is not just complicated but also gets acrimonious and chaotic at times.

From home-schooling to formal schooling, moving from India to the Netherlands, from living with an eccentric mother to being with a strict father, Kavya’s life has been turned upside down. The passage where Kavya taunts her father had me muttering, ‘Don’t, you idiot! Do you want a whack?’

When the book opens, Kavya has moved to India to be with her mother but is consumed by doubts. Does her mother want her around? She’s also trying to figure out where she stands with the two boys in her life: Kiran and Vinay. And then there’s Lara. Why is Lara suddenly so keen on her? They weren’t all that pally before.

This is not to suggest that the book is all gloom and doom. There is a lot of humour, both subtle and laugh-out-loud. Suresh excels at capturing the confusion and helplessness of youngsters. But even if you are a much older person, you relate to what’s going on.

365,2020/10/17,The star with a scar: Review of Tanaz Bhathena’s ‘Hunted by the Sky’,"A breezy read, packing in action and adventure, but feels a bit too derivative

A prophecy. A child with a scar. A villain slated to be killed by this child. The YA fantasy fiction Haunted by the Sky shares these plot points with Rowling’s Harry Potter series. There are other similarities too, but then the template of good versus evil, or of a child being born to bring down a tyrant, is universal.

It is how the writer uses the trope to create a singular and exciting world is what makes all the difference. Indian fantasy fiction writers blend mythology, history and fantasy quite effectively: it is quite a burgeoning genre here, enriched by books like Samit Basu’s The Simoqin Prophecies or the more recent An Ember in the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir. Tanaz Bhathena’s book is a welcome addition to the genre.

The story unfolds in simple prose. The fantasy world is intricately and entertainingly detailed, whether it’s the city of Ambarvadi, the magical Ambar Fort, the squalid tenements, or the mythical Tavan guarded by golden bars reaching up to the sky.

The story moves swiftly, packing in both action and adventure. Gul, the spirited heroine, has to fulfil the prophecy of destroying the evil King Lohar. Along the way, she enters into a budding romance with a young man, Cavas.

There are engaging characters — like a sisterhood of three brave women, a king who is half-human, half-animal, ghosts who materialise to communicate important matters. The chief villain, Scorpion, is infused with adequate lashings of the requisite menace to make her a formidable opponent. This is the first book in a series and the climax neatly sets the stage for the next.

If there is one drawback to the book, it is that parts of it feel derivative. Whether it’s the child with the scar, the division of people into those who can do magic (called magi) and those who can’t, or the battle between a prisoner and an unknown opponent in front of a crowd that so resembles scenes from Gladiator.

On the whole, though, it’s a breezy read.

366,2020/10/17,Writing on the wall: Review of Gautam Bhatia’s ‘The Wall’,"Gautam Bhatia’s law-centric approach to speculative fiction marks an exciting new direction for Indian sci-fi

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

Tolkien is once supposed to have said, “I wisely started with a map, and made the story fit”. Gautam Bhatia’s debut novel, The Wall, begins with a map of a circular city called Sumer enclosed by an impassable, miles-high wall — the ultimate gated community.

Looking at it, I was reminded of the first models of the cosmos by the Babylonians or the Jains, mathematical in their simplicity. Bhatia’s novel is as much an exploration of space as it is of narrative, with the map shaping the plot. As writer Peter Turchi once argued, “The map is more than metaphor: it is an organizing principle of narrative.”

Bhatia’s city-state has an artificial river running across its diameter, which then forms a series of channels that divide it into further circles or mandalas. Each circle has an economic function and a colour to mark it out (blue is the highest). Your station in life is determined by the circle you are born in, resulting in caste-like surnames such as Prana-11 or Rama-1.

Battle of ideas

At the centre is the Forum, which, rather like Corbusier’s design of Chandigarh, forms the city’s heart. There is the Council — a kind of parliament — and around it is the tower of Shoortans, a religious order, then the Select who are the Scientists, and the Academy or university.

While Sumer is pre-industrial, the Forum as well as the Wall were built by a mysterious race of beings called the Builders who possessed advanced technology. The official gospel is that due to a primal transgression, the Builders pulled a sort of inverted garden of Eden on the humans. Once this collective penance is over, the wall will crumble.

The choicest real estate is at the centre (presumably as it receives the most sunlight, while the edges are in the immense shadows cast by the wall). While the buildings of the rich, closest to the centre, are made of stone and have wide boulevards, as one ranges outwards, the quality of life drops, finally ending with slums huddled around the circumference.

The wall cannot be breached, even approaching it is taboo; but for over 2,000 years the denizens have made peace with their confinement as they till farms, mine iron, and live their lives. There are a few discontented souls who dream of a world beyond the wall, who reject the notion that their confinement is for their own good. The novel follows one of them, Mithila, and her cohort of conspirators who dream of breaching the wall.

When the story begins, all is not well with Sumer — there are crop failures, religious schisms, elite discontent and mysterious portents in the sky. While these play out as the story unfolds, the fuel for the plot is provided by a battle of ideas, competing theories on both how this world came to be and its future arrangement. All questions and conflicts flow out of Sumer’s contested past: Who built the wall and arranged this world? What is its purpose?

Speculative fiction is a laboratory where one can isolate and miniaturise a society, with its future designed, stress-tested and implemented. Bhatia’s work falls under a subgenre of science fiction called ‘Wall around the world,’ named after a 1953 short story by Theodore Cogswell.

This speculation in turn produces an X-ray of the environment in which the book is written: Sumer is riven by caste conflicts, furious battles over history, institutional decay, and an unravelling of the mechanisms of checks and balances.

While it is easy to use the wall as a metaphor, Bhatia has rigorously thought it through. For example, same-sex relations are fine while marriage between men and women needs licences — vital in a closed system to prevent uncontrolled population growth. Nothing is written down, as it will “cage history”.

Legal structures

Humanity’s shared legends and histories are refracted and replayed — there is Plato’s cave, the legend of Icarus, Prometheus, Paradise Lost, the assassination of Caesar, even the writings of Lenin, like a tape on loop. History follows the shape of the narrative — one is reminded of Mircea Eliade’s notion of a contest between the Eastern traditions of circular or sacred time and the Abrahamic concept of linear time, where, as my political scientist friend once told me, god enters history.

SF fans expecting ray-gun duels or zooming spaceships will be disappointed. There are council meetings, moot courts, fiery public speeches, and much excitement when bills are tabled. The big finale unfolds as a courtroom drama — not a surprise, given that the writer is one of the top constitutional lawyers in the country.

In an interview, Bhatia points out that legal structures “form the hidden plumbing of the world”. This law-centric approach is something new, representing an exciting new direction for Indian sci-fi.

The genteel tone reminded me of Asimov’s Foundation novels, where violence takes place off-screen and characters engage in erudite debates. In our hyper-polarised world today, the notion that a sincere and rational argument can touch you, change your mind, seems like pure science fiction.

367,2020/10/17,‘The Death Script’ review: Strangers in the land: The life and death of Korsa Joga,"With anecdotal evidence, a journalist narrates his many encounters with the police, rebels and informers in the Dandakaranaya forest

Maoists in Chhattisgarh traditionally have a bigger market, which they are possibly unaware of, in the publishing industry or South Asia studies departments globally than in Chhattisgarh, where they have not been expanding for some time. Many Ph.D.s are penned or manuscripts submitted each year and very few are readable.

Ashutosh Bhardwaj’s The Death Script is refreshingly different. A journalist who worked in Chhattisgarh, he provides detailed anecdotes of his encounters with the police, paramilitary forces, informers and left-wing rebels. He has followed certain characters and describes particular phases in their lives that intertwined with his in Chhattisgarh.

Multiple journeys

But the book is not just about Chhattisgarh or Maoists, it is also about the author’s multiple other journeys. For this reviewer, who worked as a journalist around the same time in Chhattisgarh, it was difficult to understand why events which are not connected to the conflict are featured, perhaps because of a training to look for facts.

For example, following a graphic description of how a dozen villagers were killed in a place called Sarkeguda in south Chhattisgarh, the author moves to Benares to talk about his chance meeting with a woman, which is a sad story but not connected to the incident in Sarkeguda. But then as the reader moves on, perhaps the connection becomes apparent.

The author looks at the river and thinks of the colossal waste of life in Chhattisgarh. “As I stare at the ravenous apparitions of burning pyres floating over the Ganga, my sins come back to haunt me,” he writes. It is unusual as books on Chhattisgarh are usually about a lot of violence and conspiracies. While The Death Script has its share of blood and gore, it often takes a detour to talk about a stray frog or a chance meeting in Benares.

Stories from Benares

Possibly there is a reason or two for these digressions. Conflict reporting is often about body counts and it could be a pointless exercise unless the reader, who may be far away, is connected. Stories from another world, Benares in this case, which is relatively free of violence, is required to keep the readers connected.

On occasions, he digs deep to explain the severe hurdles a tribal woman or man faces when she or he tries to leave the arduous life of a rebel to settle in the cities as a civilian. Korsa Joga, a Naxal commander, after making many attempts to move away from conflict finally returned to the forest to take up arms, albeit for the forces. The story of the commander, narrated over six pages, indicates why rebels often decide to stay in the forest despite looking for avenues to escape.

What however one may miss — especially from Bhardwaj, who investigated many important stories in Chhattisgarh (particularly ones about paid journalism or Maoist surrenders) — is an investigation of the source of Maoist funding or the government’s policy on surrendered militants. However, writing a book on the issues and problems of Naxals in south Chhattisgarh is a difficult task now more than before.

Bhardwaj deals with the situation deftly, narrating the land’s woes in several short stories rather than a long one, making it an eminently readable account.

368,2020/10/17,‘The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World’ review: Preparing for a multipolar world,"What should be the direction of India’s foreign policy as the global order changes? India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar seeks to address this question in his new book

The global order is undergoing changes. If it was largely bipolar during the Cold War and then briefly unipolar after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, there are signs of emerging multipolarity. China is already the world’s second largest economy and a major military power. Russia has come out of its self-imposed strategic retreat. From Germany to Japan and India to Brazil, middle powers are also expected to play key roles in the new order. What should be the direction of India’s foreign policy in such changing times? S. Jaishankar, India’s External Affairs Minister, seeks to address this question in his book, The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

When a sitting foreign minister writes a book on the country’s foreign policy, the reader would naturally expect some insights into New Delhi’s policy thinking. In that sense, Jaishankar lays out the broad framework of India’s policymaking. He emphasises a realistic approach free of dogmas, willing to take risks and ready to engage different powers at the same time. In the book, culled from the speeches he gave over the past two years, Jaishankar offers an overview of the evolution of India’s foreign policy through the pitfalls and the opportunities ahead. “This is a time to engage America, manage China, cultivate Europe, reassure Russia, bring Japan into play,” writes Jaishankar, who was India’s Ambassador in both Washington and Beijing before becoming the Foreign Secretary and then the External Affairs Minister in the BJP-led government.

Call for action

From what he writes, it’s evident that he doesn’t favour India joining any alliance system. But he doesn’t support the old school non-alignment either. He gives the example of Balarama and Rukmi of Vidarbha from the Mahabharata to make his point. Both stayed out of the war but they had to face the consequences anyway. “Where we have remained uninvolved, we are nevertheless left to face consequences. On some questions, we run the danger of displeasing all parties. Where we have aligned on larger contradictions, our reluctance in doing so fully has not been without costs,” writes Jaishankar. It’s a call for action. And the action, according to him, is defined by “Krishna's choice”— “follow the dharma of the state”, that is asserting national interest and securing strategic goals through various means. In other words, his bet is on “multiple engagements” for a multipolar world. “It appears more energetic and participative as compared to an earlier posture of abstention or non-involvement.”

In India’s engagement with the West, Jaishankar emphasises the shared values as well as the changes underway. The West, he argues, should accept that India’s growth “is a strategic development in the larger western interest”. With regard to Pakistan, he talks about the Uri and Balakot models, arguing that India established a new normal that terrorist actions won’t go unpunished. When it comes to China, his mantra is realism. He commends the “strategic maturity” that’s at work between the two countries. “That realisation led to the Wuhan and Chennai summits... both occasions were exercises in pure realism.”

Future role

It’s well argued, and few will disagree that India has to multi-engage with a changing world, without compromising on its strategic autonomy. The problem, however, is that beyond this framework, Jaishankar, perhaps constrained by his role in the government, doesn’t offer finer details. India Way reads more like a diplomat’s handbook — which is important in understanding the functioning of diplomacy — rather than a strategic analyst’s assessment of history and prescriptions for the future. It’s not free of contradictions either. Jaishankar stresses on India’s pluralism, values of multi-faith society and its democratic framework. Yet the government he’s part of has been under attack, both domestically and internationally, for endangering India’s plural values. When he writes the West should accept that “an elite created in western mould has now outlived its relevance” in India, he sounds more like a politician than a seasoned diplomat.

What drives diplomacy?

Jaishankar clearly states the “economy drives diplomacy, not the other way around.” Unfortunately, he has to drive India’s diplomacy at a time when the country is facing a severe economic contraction — one of the worst among major economies — which would, according to his own arguments, limit India’s options. He lauds India’s realism in reaching out to China in Wuhan and Chennai (the book was written before the Galwan clashes). Now, there could be new questions about the whole China policy of the Narendra Modi government. Was its China policy driven by realism or hubris?

While he rightly blames legacy issues for the China problem, one can’t ignore the revolt in India’s neighbourhood against New Delhi under his government, whether they are short-term irritants or evolving strategic challenges. So, while the foreign policy framework India Way offers is an authoritative account of New Delhi’s worldview, its efficacy will be known only when tested on the altar of history.

369,2020/10/17,‘Cricket Drona’ review: A guiding force of cricket,"Coach Vasoo Paranjape held a mirror to players ranging from Sunil Gavaskar to Rohit Sharma and made them understand their game better

Cricket is split into binaries — runs and wickets or triumphs and defeats. But the game, harking back to shepherds hitting a ball with a log in ancient Britain, has infinite layers. Among its charms is the former cricketer, who turns mentor blending zest and grandfatherly warmth.

Vasoo Paranjape of the old Bombay cricketing school is one such gentleman. Paranjape has been associated with the sport, both as a First-Class player and then as a coach besides being the guiding force behind Dadar Union, a club that had luminaries such as Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar.

However, selfless men like Paranjape never get attention and it is that flaw which gets rectified through Cricket Drona, a book penned by his son and former India cricketer Jatin Paranjape along with cricket writer Anand Vasu. The tome works at two levels, as a tribute to a father and as a reflection of a seasoned journalist’s doggedness in getting many stars to describe their association with Paranjape Senior.

Tributes from greats

The book features many cricketers and a few veteran journalists speaking about Paranjape and he returns the favour with most of them, dwelling upon what he saw, be it a Gavaskar or a Rohit Sharma. And the greats of Indian cricket ranging from Sachin Tendulkar to Anil Kumble are present across these 194 pages.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

“Everything, even poetry, reminds me of cricket,” Jatin writes and the all-encompassing nature of this particular sport is weaved into the subsequent pages with Anand being the eager chronicler, meeting players, transcribing tapes and adding his light touch.

Early in his foreword, Gavaskar observes: “He (Paranjape) had the wonderful ability to spot some error and communicate it to you in a direct but humorous way.” This gentle demeanour finds reiteration as other cricketers too vouch for Paranjape’s ability to hold a mirror and make them understand themselves.

Tendulkar discloses how Paranjape put in a word with the late Raj Singh Dungarpur ahead of India’s tour of Pakistan in 1989 and the rest is history. Paranjape was his own man and Sanjay Manjrekar underlines this attribute: “While Vasoo was a lover of cricket and of cricketers, he was never touched by sycophancy.” There are some remarkable lines of introspection about cricket and Rahul Dravid says: “If you are a coach you have to think about how to keep people in the game — if not as players, then as spectators, as consumers of the game.”

There are nuggets too like Rohit asking Jatin about any observations from Paranjape Senior, Kumble speaking about a letter he wrote to his coach and off-spinner Ramesh Powar crying while mentioning that he owes everything to his mentor.

This book is an exercise in gratitude and the quibbles are restricted to a printer’s devil (sLord’s) and an inaccuracy — there is a line about Gavaskar’s last tour of Australia in 1980-81. The legendary opener did visit Australia again in the mid-1980s. This is a fine book about a man, who at 81, still believes in passing on knowledge while shunning the limelight.

370,2020/10/17,Artists from Kerala use leaves from trees as canvas,"Coconut palm leaves, and those of jackfruit, teak and peepal turn into canvases for artists in Kerala, during lockdown

On Dulquer Salman’s birthday in July, members of Kerala Leaf Artist’s Association made 21 leaf artworks — portraits made on leaf — of the actor and posted it on the Association’s Instagram page (kerala_leaf_artists). Recently, they followed it up with some of Nivin Pauly’s, on his birthday, October 11.

‘Leaf art’ is drawing on a leaf — like a stencil — using a knife. These artists post their work, usually of actors on their Instagram handles, and by tagging them, hope to be noticed. “It might be about getting noticed but it translates to commissioned work for us,” says Manu KM (aesthetic._.soul), an artist from Aluva. Commissioned work sustains them, especially during times such as now. This comprises framed leaf portraits, “it is something like getting caricatures done,” he says.

The Leaf Artists’ Association, formed in March has around 65 members — most started doing leaf art during lockdown. The members encourage each other, share how-to tips and pass on orders for commissioned work.

Twenty-two-year-old Manu is a ‘veteran’, having started a couple of years ago. “There were barely two or three of us then. More people are coming in since there isn’t much else to do,” he says. A leaf art video made him curious enough to give it a shot. Works by artists such as Manu inspired others like college student Midhun Pradeep (midhun_pradeep_art_) of Edathua, Alappuzha and lab technician Akshaya K of Calicut (art_semper).

Akshaya K’s portrait with coconut palm

Akshaya is ‘new’ to leaves, “I have wanted to but work kept me busy. With lockdown, I had all the time and leaves.” She is one of the few women leaf artists in Kerala; she works with easily-found jackfruit leaves.

An unassuming canvas

Leaves of jackfruit, banyan, teak and peepal trees are used. “These are thick, can be drawn on and cut. Teak leaves are not easy, despite their size, as they tear easily. The perfect leaf to me is one that has a good shape and large enough surface area,” says Manu, a former bank employee.

He is one of the few artists who works with coconut palm, a difficult medium as it has no ‘surface area’. Four portraits can be made on each, two on either side. The leaf is readied using tape to secure the sections together to create a surface, before drawing and carving the picture. The work lasts for barely two days before the leaf starts drying.

Midhun Pradeep’s portrait of actor Tovino Thomas

“It is a challenge, and is satisfying. Earlier I had time, now with online classes I have to make time,” says Midhun. Appreciation is a great motivator for him. Although other actors have shared his works on their Instagram pages, he hopes actor Tovino Thomas sees his tribute on a coconut palm.

Manu was pleasantly surprised when actor Vijay Sethupathi sent a voice note thanking him for his work — two portraits made on a coconut palm leaf.

While an expert would need only an hour to make a portrait on a jackfruit leaf, four portraits on a coconut leaf can take up to six hours. For commissioned works, the leaves (not coconut) are varnished and then framed so they do not dry. The price for a single portrait is ₹1,000 and ₹1,200 and above for two.

Kamal Hasan’s portrait by Kiran Karthik

Interestingly, there are only a few works featuring female actors. “Women’s faces have finer details such as eyebrows, the lips that need more attention. There is more free space, as opposed to men whose hair and beard are comparatively easier to interpret,” says Kiran Karthik (mr._drawer), a Thiruvananthapuram-based leaf artist, who also carves portraits on watermelons.

The challenge, Midhun jokes, is finding the perfect spot to photograph the works, especially those on coconut trees.

“You need an open space, where the sky forms the backdrop for the art work to show,” he says, adding “And with these restrictions one can’t venture out too far!”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/3dey8q/article32881078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPART12jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/coconut-palm-leaves-and-those-of-jackfruit-teak-and-peepual-turn-into-canvases-for-artists-in-kerala-during-during-lockdown/article32881085.ece
371,2020/10/17,These small companies are showing us the way to eco-friendly packaging,"While e-commerce giants are being pulled up for using excessive plastic, small inspiring initiatives are springing up across the country offering elegant, yet practical, eco-friendly packaging

When 27-year-old Asiya K discovered that a typical potato chips bag is made of multiple layers of polymer — sometimes four layers, at times seven — she knew she could never consume chips guilt free again.

“I researched and learnt that despite the harm these bags pose to the environment, most companies prefer these bags as they are lightweight, graphics friendly and do not take much space. However, the downside is that these bags are rarely recyclable as we are still to invent machines that will separate the layers of these bags. I tried looking for chips and snacks packed in eco-friendly bags but there are not many options,” says the resident of Bengaluru.

From T-shirts to plants

Plastic packaging has been one of the greatest contributors to filling our landfills. Recently, the National Green Tribunal pulled up Amazon and Flipkart for excessive plastic packaging, directing the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to conduct an environmental audit and recover the fine from the e-commerce giants.

While giants struggle to find eco-friendly alternatives, several smaller companies across the country are doing their bit to protect the environment.

When Mumbai-based Mikail Pardiwala and his brother Mishal decided to make a switch in lifestyle by adopting organic products in eco-friendly packaging, it was a tough choice. It was a challenge to even identify companies that used green packaging not just for their products but also for shipping.

Finally the duo decided to start its own: Treewear, selling organic deodorants and hand sanitisers.

“The cardboard and newspaper that we use is pre-used and procured from donors. We also look for creative ways to upcycle plastic. For instance, we ship our T-shirts in packages made from post-consumer recycled plastic water bottles, which are otherwise destined for the landfill. We advise customers to use these bottles as planters later, and send our seed-embedded business cards along to help them grow plants in those bottles,” says Mikail.

Their products are shipped in cardboard boxes tied with jute rope, and packed in with newspaper shreds.

“To ensure that our glass bottles are not damaged while shipping, we put them in a triangular box because, according to our experience, such boxes keep the items steady. We do use plastic caps on the glass bottles used for insect repellents and hand sanitisers, as we are yet to find a greener alternative. However, these bottles are made from quality material, so they can be reused after a refill,” adds Mikail.

Reality bites

Helping the food industry to make greener choices is Visakhapatnam-based House of Folium, that sells eco-friendly cutlery. Run by SV Vijay Lakshmi, a former software engineer, the company sells plates, bowls, forks and spoons made from sugarcane pulp.

“We never think about what happens after we toss that plastic container in the trash bin. How much gets recycled? Why waste resources on recycling when we can use eco-friendly materials?” asks Vijay Lakshmi.

“Many of us rely heavily on food delivery apps, especially during the pandemic when we cannot step out. The amount of plastic that is used in the logistics is unacceptable. That is why we need to make the greener switch; we have seen a gradual change happening in Visakhapatnam where home-chefs are consciously making the choice to use eco-friendly cutlery. We also have catered to smaller parties of 150-200 people by providing caterers with our green products,” says Vijaylakhmi.

When Diwia Thomas started PaperTrail in Kochi in 2008, it was to provide underprivileged women a source of income. For the initial few years, the company just made newspaper bags of various sizes. Today, with a team of over 30 women, the company ships its eco-friendly packaging products like boxes, trays and bags across India, some regions of USA, and the Gulf countries.

“Our growth has come from two things; good quality products and people’s growing choice to use eco-friendly alternatives. Our biggest client base is home bakers and event planners, who are consciously working to reduce their dependence on plastic,” says Diwia.

The more, the merrier

One of PaperTrail’s most popular products are biodegradable garbage bags, launched in 2019, after the Kerala Government banned plastic.

Diwia says, “Made from vegetable starch, these bags decompose in 180 days. They are now three times more expensive than plastic ones, as sheets made from vegetable starch are not easily available in the market. Once more people start using it, we will see more suppliers and a drop in price.”

Rennee Saradha, who runs Pidi in Chennai, serves steam-cooked gluten-free kozhukkattais (rice dumplings) in charming boxes made of palm leaves. When she launched her venture early this year, she decided that if the food is native, the packaging should follow suit.

The wide variety of sweet and savoury dumplings she serves are wrapped and steamed in the leaves of native trees like peepal, banana and vilva.

“Using these leaves not just brings down delivery charges, but also adds to the flavour of the food,” she says, adding “If more people use these leaves for packaging, more people will grow these trees.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/vudfwh/article32880908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pidi-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/these-small-companies-are-showing-us-the-way-to-eco-friendly-packaging/article32880910.ece
372,2020/10/17,"The Peoples’ Biodiversity Register, meant to empower local communities, is leaving them out","With PBRs being outsourced to NGOs or universities, the role of local people has been restricted to that of helping researchers in data collection

Parvathy Nagaraj, from Nallur village in Tamil Nadu, would watch her grandmother make medicines from plants she collected from the forest and treat the villagers for many common ailments. Today, Parvathy can identify 100 plants in the forests she grew up in. “I am the sixth generation of healers in my family; and I want to use my knowledge to treat people and also conserve the plants in the forest,” she says.

Some 2,000 km away, in Rajasthan, Harji Ram, from the Raika camel herding community, says his community can identify 36 different trees and shrubs that the camels feed on. These plants also happen to have tremendous value in medicine.

Before the Biological Diversity Act (BDA) was passed in 2002, there was no formal recognition of the knowledge that men and women like Harji and Parvathy possessed. The ‘discovery’ of flora and fauna was either the prerogative of the colonial explorer or the modern scientist with a university degree. The traditional knowledge of millions of forest dwellers, fisherfolk, pastoralists and hunting communities about the biodiversity in their backyards was never considered to be on a par with formal research. And if a private company wanted to exploit these natural resources, they were not required to pay the communities that had known about and nurtured them for centuries.

Sharing benefits

The pathbreaking Act not only supports the conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources, it also promotes an equitable sharing of benefits that come from their use. This one law has the potential to revolutionalise the rights of communities over the natural resources they live with. The BDA has made it mandatory for every local self-governing institution in rural and urban areas to constitute a Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) within their area of jurisdiction. Once constituted, the BMC must prepare a Peoples’ Biodiversity Register (PBR) in consultation with local people. A PBR comprehensively documents traditional knowledge of local biological resources. The BMC is the custodian of these resources, and any industry that extracts biological resources from these areas has to share part of its revenue with the local community.

But the wheels of change have been slow to turn. Years later, by 2016, only 9,700 BMCs had been set up for the 2,70,573 local bodies across the country; compliance was thus a mere 3.58%. And just 1,388 PBRs were completed that year.

Then, in 2016, an order was passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which shook the entire administration out of its lethargy. A petition filed by Chandra Bhal Singh before the NGT asked for the effective implementation of the BDA. The NGT directed 100% compliance in the constitution of BMCs and in the creation of PBRs by January 31, 2020. The NGT said States would be fined ₹10 lakh per month from February 1, 2020 if they failed to comply with its order.

People matter

That was the game changer. States began work at a frenetic pace. Today, eight months after the NGT deadline, some 1,90,950 PBRs have been completed or are in various stages of preparation, representing 70% of the country’s PBR coverage. These figures come from V.B. Mathur, Chairperson, National Biodiversity Authority, tasked with ensuring the monitoring of PBRs and BMCs.

“While the NGT order was quantitative, we wanted to make sure it doesn’t affect the quality of the process, as people’s participation is necessary,” he says. But in the hurry to meet the deadline, have the people been left out?

In Uttarakhand, for instance, the onus seems to be on the forest department to implement the law. Dhananjay Prasad, Deputy Director of the State Biodiversity Board, admits that with the lack of funds and the large number of local bodies, the task of setting up BMCs and creating PBRs is an unwieldy exercise. “There are around 8,000 local bodies in Uttarakhand, and the budget allotted could barely cover the compilation of PBRs for all these bodies,” says Prasad. So the BMCs were initially formed using the manpower of the State Forest Department. Forest guards were roped in and trained. Then, to record biodiversity, technical experts who specialised in agriculture, botany, animal husbandry and urban biodiversity were brought in.

In Himachal Pradesh, the ‘contract’ for making PBRs was awarded to several universities, with each one getting a contract for 30-40 villages. But it meant that public participation was low. Jhabe Ram, chairman of the BMC, Jana Gram Panchayat in Naggar, Himachal, says that the State Biodiversity Board sent him to Bengaluru for training, but other experts were called in to prepare the PBR. Says Ram, “I possess a lot of knowledge about the plants in the forest but I don’t know their botanical names. So they got experts from Shimla to prepare the PBR. It was created two to three years ago, and I have yet to see it.”

Various environmental groups have also come forward to prepare the registers. For instance, The Energy and Resources Institute prepared the PBR for the village Ghukhuyi, in Zünheboto, Nagaland. Likewise the People’s Biodiversity Register of Tourenga Gram Panchayat in Chhattisgarh was published with technical guidance from the Wildlife Trust of India.

In Jharkhand, a local NGO, Pragati Educational Academy, applied for the process of setting up BMCs and PBRs in response to an advert put out by the State Biodiversity Board seeking consultants. Babita Kashyap, who coordinated the NGO’s efforts, says they try to ensure people’s participation by visiting every Panchayat for demographic information. For biodiversity information, however, they bring in experts. “We use botanists and zoologists. People from the village describe plants in their local languages, which we may not understand.”

Similar stories emerge from other parts of the country such as Maharashtra and Telangana. With PBRs being outsourced to NGOs or universities, the role of local people has been restricted to that of helping researchers in data collection. And this is not in sync with NBA’s guidelines on PBRs. A PBR, says environment lawyer Ritwick Dutta, is more than just a compilation of species. “The preparation of PBRs by consultants defeats the whole purpose of having this register. Local people are central to the process; the task cannot be outsourced to a third party.”

Created over centuries

Besides this, there are also some communities glaringly missing from the process altogether. Nomadic pastoralists, for instance, and the livestock breeds they have created over centuries. Ilse Köhler-Rollefson has spent a lifetime with the camel herding community, the Raikas of Rajasthan. She says, “Moving around in the spaces between villages, they are major producers of food without cultivation, while at the same time they conserve and add value to biodiversity.” Being nomadic, they are crucial for biodiversity conservation, yet they fall outside the scope of the village BMCs, even of State biodiversity boards.

Hanwant Singh Rathore, from the Raika community, who set up the Lokhit Pashu-Palak Sansthan, rues that not even one BMC has been prepared in conversation with his community. “Even though we possess so much knowledge, our views have never been considered, nor has any BMC been formed.” The Raika herders have even prepared their own ‘Biocultural Community Protocol of the Camel Breeders of Rajasthan’ as an example of what a PBR for their community could look like. The document has been submitted to the forest department “but no one has responded,” says Rathore.

Likewise, Kaustubh Pandharipande, who has worked extensively with denotified tribes in Central India, argues that non-pastoral nomads may not keep animals but have a deep relationship with biodiversity. “This has never been recognised; many of them sell medicinal plants and depend on the forest.”

Long before PBRs were recognised as a legal category, Pandharipande had started work with the Phasepardhis (a hunting community socially ostracised since colonial times). The process he initiated included field surveys of birds, their populations and habitats, documenting local knowledge and practices, and monitoring and protecting the birds. “People like the pardhis have been completely ignored, there should be some legal space for them,” says Pandharipande, who heads the Foundation for Economic and Ecological Development.

Perhaps no one knows more about the process of the PBRs than ecologist and scholar Madhav Gadgil. Gadgil, who was the first to call for recognising the rights of communities over their resources, says the PBRs have become nothing more than an exercise in listing species. He laments the lack of community participation and the fact that the PBR is still not being used as a people’s tool.

Right rewards

Indeed, the only way communities can use these PBRs to control their natural resources; prevent (or get a fair price from) industries coming in to exploit these resources; and contribute overall to conservation is to increase their participation in the process.

Look at the instances where handing over control of natural resources to the people has reaped big rewards. The Uttarakhand State Biodiversity Board issued notices to nearly 600 industries — including Dabur and its rival Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali — for using natural resources in the hill State without adequately compensating the communities.

In Kerala, the Eraviperoor Biodiversity Management Committee rejuvenated a tributary of the River Pampa, successfully recovering 13.5 acres of riverbank. It has also done exemplary work in plastic waste management.

The BMC in Raipassa village in Tripura has signed an agreement with companies for harvesting broom grass and making sure that the funds are transferred back to the community.

Meanwhile, NBA’s Mathur says he wants to incentivise conservation “keeping in mind adequate protection and restoration of biological resources while promoting livelihoods for local communities through generous benefit-sharing protocols.”

A critical question comes up: Will the NGOs and consultants who helped prepare the biodiversity registers and committees join hands with the communities when it comes to fighting the bigger battles, such as those against mining companies coming in to acquire land, or a new dam that submerges their forests?

This is where the true litmus test of the power of the PBRs lies. It has the scope to become the ultimate tool for a people-centric environment impact assessment process that allows communities living next to the resource to remain the real commanders. If implemented with the right degree of people’s participation, the PBRs could indeed become a trailblazer on the road to environmental democracy.

373,2020/10/17,"Tuberculosis notifications in 2020 down by 25% in India, global report says","COVID-19 pandemic, combined with impacts on care-seeking behaviour, threatens to reverse recent progress

The COVID-19 pandemic, combined with impacts on care-seeking behaviour, threatens to reverse the recent progress in reducing the global burden of tuberculosis (TB) disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) warns in the latest Global TB Report.

“There is already evidence from several high TB burden countries of large reductions in the monthly number of people with TB being detected and officially reported in 2020, especially in India and other countries,” the report says.

While India accounts for 26% of TB cases in the world, the TB notifications during the period January-June 2020 in India fell by 25% compared to the same period in 2019.

The TB notifications in India in February this year increased compared with January but then reduced sharply in April to reach less than 40% of the January figure before increasing to reach about 75% of January figure in the month of June. However, compared with Indonesia, Philippines and South Africa, the dip in TB notifications has not been very sharp in India and the recovery after the dip has been more in India than the other three countries.

In terms of weekly TB notifications in India, the numbers reached over 50,000 a few weeks before the national lockdown before dipping to about 15,000 notifications a week in about three weeks after the lockdown went into effect. It then increased to reach about 35,000 cases notified a week by mid-May, before slightly reducing in the following weeks.

Overall, there has been a recovery from the lowest point in mid-April, but it has not been at the pre-March levels when the lockdown came into effect. Decreases occurred in both the public and private sector.

In India, notifications of people newly diagnosed with TB increased 74% from 1.2 million to 2.2 million between 2013 and 2019. Despite the increase in notifications, there is still a gap in the number of people newly diagnosed and reported in the world and the estimated number of people who would have developed TB in 2019. In the case of India, this gap accounts for 17%, the WHO report says. This gap is due to a combination of underreporting of people diagnosed with TB and underdiagnosis (if people with TB cannot access health care or are not diagnosed when they do).

The report says that the global number of TB deaths could increase by “around 0.2-0.4 million in 2020 alone, if health services are disrupted to the extent that the number of people with TB who are detected and treated falls by 25-50% over a period of three months”.

In March, when the pandemic began to spread to many countries across the world and as countries were declaring lockdowns to gain time to control the virus spread, the WHO had urged member states to maintain continuity of TB services even during the global outbreak of COVID-19. It said programmes already in place to combat TB and other major infectious diseases can be leveraged to make the response to COVID-19 more effective and rapid.

“The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to undermine our gains,” WHO Global TB Program Director Dr. Tereza Kasaeva said at a WHO virtual press briefing.

Among the problems cited is reassignment of people from national TB programs to COVID-1-related duties, reductions in the number health-care facilities treating people with TB, a reduction in collection of data. In addition, many countries, India included, are using rapid diagnostic tests used for detecting TB for COVID-19 testing instead.

“2020 is a critical year for all of us,” Dr. Kasaeva says. “While we struggle to overcome the COVID pandemic together, we should not neglect the millions of people suffering and dying from TB.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/7lr4qy/article26984511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30TH-TB,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/tuberculosis-notifications-in-2020-down-by-25-in-india-global-report-says/article32878731.ece
374,2020/10/17,Early childhood stress and mental illness,"Mice were studied by modulating the pathway affecting excitatory neurons

It is known that adversity in early life can have long-term effects on mental health of adults. Now, a study using mice led by scientists from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, finds that stimulating a particular pathway in the brain in early life can cause anxiety, depression and even schizophrenia-like symptoms later in life. This does not happen if the stimulation is carried out in adolescent or adult mice. The study has been published in the journal eLife.

Engineering the mice

Using genetic engineering the researchers modulated a specific pathway in the brains of mice which is known to stimulate the excitatory neurons in the forebrain region. When they carried out prolonged stimulation in two-week old mice and observed them when they grew into adults, the researchers found that the adult mice exhibited signs of increased anxiety, depression-like behaviour and even symptoms of schizophrenia-like behaviour. Such behaviour was not observed in mice that had been subjected to the stimulation as adolescents or adults.

The group used bigenic mouse models that were engineered to express Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) in excitatory neurons of the forebrain. Vidita Vaidya of TIFR who led the research says, “The DREADD in question results in increased Gq signalling when it is stimulated by [specific] drugs...” This increased Gq signalling stimulates the excitatory neurons in the forebrain.

Prof. Vaidya further explains the observation of schizophrenia-like behaviour thus: Usually when someone is surprised by a sudden, loud sound, they show a startled response. But if the loud sound is preceded by a softer sound of lower volume, they show inhibition of the startled response. This is called pre-pulse inhibition.

Pre-pulse inhibition

In the case of individuals with schizophrenia, the pre-pulse inhibition does not happen. The behaviour of the experimental mice that had been subjected to stimulation of excitatory neurons in their infancy was interesting. “We study the pre-pulse inhibition behaviour which is a hallmark of a behavioural change noted in patients of schizophrenia. Animals in which we have stimulated Gq signalling in forebrain excitatory neurons go on to exhibit pre-pulse inhibition deficits in adulthood,” she explains.

The entire study took nearly six years, with major participation by Sthitaprajnya Pati, a PhD student with Prof. Vaidya. Collaborators James Chelliah at JNCASR, Bengaluru and Anant Patel at CCMB provided key support for electrophysiology experiments and NMR experiments, respectively.

Early-life window

The researchers had several controls for different aspects of the experiment: “We checked whether the genetic strategy itself has behavioural effects which it didn’t. We tested the effects of DREADD activation in adolescent and adult mice and that also had no effect,” says Prof. Vaidya. Thus, there is a “tight time-window in early life” when animals are highly sensitive to this perturbation.

The study throws open several interesting questions. “If we can mimic the effects of early stress using these chemogenetic strategies, can we also reverse the effects of early stress? If so, is there a restricted window of time in which reversal would work?” says Prof. Vaidya.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ee6g4h/article32882228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TH-SCIVIDITAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/early-childhood-stress-and-mental-illness/article32882229.ece
375,2020/10/17,Question Corner | Can mosquitoes taste human blood?,"Readers may send their questions to questioncorner@thehindu.co.in

Researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the Rockefeller University have for the first time found that female mosquitoes have individual neurons that sense human blood’s distinctive flavour.

The sense of taste is specially tuned to detect a combination of at least four different substances in blood — glucose, sodium chloride (common salt), sodium bicarbonate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

The researchers found that female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes possess different neurons in the syringe-like stylet, which punctures the skin, to distinguish blood from nectar (Neuron, October 2020). Blood-feeding mosquitoes survive by feeding on nectar for metabolic energy, but require a blood meal to develop eggs. They found that female mosquitoes have two feeding modes that use different mouthparts and detect different flavours.

To see what’s special about the combination of these four ingredients, the researchers first tested how mosquito stylets responded to each component. Surprisingly, glucose found in both nectar and blood did not activate any neurons. But the other three ingredients — sodium chloride (common salt), sodium bicarbonate and ATP — which are found only in blood and not in nectar activated a specific group of neurons. One prominent cluster of neurons activated only when the entire blood recipe was delivered together and not individually. The findings shed light on just how specially adapted the female mosquito is to find blood.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/pby23e/article23787984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mosquito,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/question-corner-can-mosquitoes-taste-human-blood/article32882223.ece
376,2020/10/17,The enigma that is COVID-19,"The disease is a complex interplay of infection, immunity and reinfection

In July, a large seroprevalence study in Mumbai reported that 57% slum residents and 16% building residents had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The presence of antibodies implied that these individuals had been infected, and had now developed protective antibodies. Similar results were found in other cities, leading to optimism that “herd immunity,” the protection that a community enjoys from a germ by virtue of a significant proportion of individuals being immune, was not a distant dream.

Optimism on hold

Two recent changes have put such optimism on hold: Reinfections being reported across the world and declining seroprevalence of antibodies in repeat sampling surveys done in both Mumbai and Delhi. The latter suggests a possible “decay” of antibodies with time.

Nasal and throat swabs for SARS-CoV-2 can remain positive due to dead viral RNA for over 2 months, but such re-positivity does not imply reinfection. A true reinfection is one in which the viral genome in the second infection differs from that of the first. Proving this necessitates the whole genome sequencing of both viral strains, a research tool that is not accessible routinely to healthcare providers. Clues to a possible reinfection include more severe disease (both clinically and on laboratory investigations) and a lower cycling threshold value (which may reflect an increased quantum of virus) on the RT-PCR test done during the second episode. A negative swab between the two episodes helps further distinguish re-positives from reinfections. Instead of RT-PCR for viral RNA, which detects live and dead virus, subgenomic messenger RNA, a product of actively replicating virus, can be used to detect viable virus.

Forms of immunity

Two forms of immunity defend the body from reinfection: antibody-mediated (through immunoglobulins, which recognise parts of the virus and neutralise it), and cell-mediated (through cells such as T-cells which can induce death of virus-infected cells). Antibodies could either be binding antibodies (which bind to the virus and sensitise the immune system) or neutralising antibodies (which directly bind to the virus and interfere with its function). Unlike antibodies induced by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (the causative viruses of the 2003 and 2012 outbreaks, respectively) that lasted a minimum of 1-2 years, studies have demonstrated the rapid waning of antibodies after infection from SARS-CoV-2. Does this mean that such individuals are susceptible to reinfection? Not necessarily. Most commercial antibody tests detect binding antibodies, while immunological memory is more accurately reflected by the presence of neutralising antibodies. Secondly, the role of cell-mediated immunity has not been elucidated yet. A study from France by Gallais et al. demonstrated the evidence of cell-mediated immunity among family contacts of individuals with COVID-19, despite such individuals having undetectable antibodies. Similar studies for SARS-CoV have demonstrated evidence of cell-mediated immunity for over a decade (despite waning antibodies). However, the presence of cell-mediated immunity is not routinely measurable, and unfortunately, it isn’t guaranteed to ensure immunity either. One does hope, though, that such immunological memory has a role in protecting from reinfections.

The implications of what we know thus far are manifold. It must be pointed out that after 8 months of the pandemic, reinfections still seem exceedingly rare. However, an individual who has recovered from an episode of COVID-19 needs to be cognisant of the fact that recovery does not ensure immunity, and keep up the precautions of masking, physical distancing and hand sanitising need to continue unabated. From a healthcare provider’s perspective, we now know that the constellation of symptoms and signs that make us suspect the possibility of COVID-19 disease needs to be investigated, irrespective of whether the patient has already had the disease. From a community perspective, we need to rethink the constructs of immunity passports, herd immunity and vaccination strategies, taking into account the possibility that with the passage of time, immunity, whether induced by infection or vaccination, may wane, and reinfections/vaccine failures may become more common.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to outsmart us, and till the time that an effective vaccine which confers long-lasting immunity is available, a world with the virus will continue to haunt us, like the lyrics of a famous song: “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave!”.

377,2020/10/17,How global warming might affect food security,"It would be useful to do lab experiments on model plants

Between the year 1870 (the first industrial revolution) and today, the global temperature has risen by almost 2 degrees Celsius. This has come about due to more fossil burning (oil, natural gas, coal), which has also increased the carbon dioxide (abbreviated as CO 2 ) levels from 280 ppm to 400 ppm. This heating has caused glaciers (and snow capping mountains) to melt and the sea level to rise. Daniel Glick, in the October 2 issue of National Geographic Magazine warns that the glaciers in Garhwal, Uttarakhand may virtually disappear by 2035!

Ocean acidification

The rise in CO2 levels has also acidified the ocean, leading to weakening the shells and skeletons of animals living in the sea, climate.org. On land, the rise in CO 2 levels has both positive and negative effects. This being a ‘Green House Gas’, it traps the Sun’s heat from the atmosphere and warms the temperature, aids in the photosynthesis of plants, making them grow more, but at the same time restricts the plant’s ability to absorb nitrogen, thus restricting crop growth, phys.org.

How will this CO 2 level heating affect food security in the coming years? D.S. Battisti and R.L. Naylor warned of this in 2009 in their paper in Science: “Historical warnings of future food insecurity with unprecedented seasonal heat” <DOI: 10.1126/science.1164363>. They warned that such higher temperatures during the ‘growing season’ in the tropics and sub-tropic regions (India and our neighbours, Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America) will greatly affect crop productivity, and that this would be the ‘norm’. Given this double whammy of affecting ocean life and food security, it is unpardonable for Donald Trump, president of the US, and Jair Bolsonaro, president of Brazil, to promote industry at the cost of climate change.

Experimental probes

How do global rise in temperature and CO 2 level affect plant growth and yield? Do they promote higher yields or do they also lead to stress in the metabolism, generating some negative effects? Can we do some laboratory experiments on a model plant and see what happens at today’s (normal) temperature and a ‘future’ higher one; likewise at today’s CO 2 and a ‘future’ higher level? J. Yu and his colleagues did try such experiments in 2017 in their paper: “Metatabolic pathways involved in CO 2 enhanced heat tolerance in Bermuda grass” in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2017.01506.They found that there was improved heat tolerance, and suppressed heat-induced damages. These are interesting results, but on a grass which is good for animals such as rabbits and cattle, and not for humans who do not have ruminant stomachs, nor teeth that grow upon usage as they do.

Plant meat

While grasses are what botanists call C4 plants, food grains (our staple food) are C3 and the way photosynthesis is done is somewhat different. It would thus be useful if such experiments are done on beans and legumes such as chana, chickpeas and similar grains (called ‘plant meat’).

It is towards this that a group from the Hyderabad Centre of the international agency ICRISAT (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics) decided to look at how two kinds of chickpea (the desi chana dal or the Bengal gram and the Kabuli chana (originally from Afghanistan) behave under different CO2 levels (current level of 380 ppm, and two higher levels (550 and 700 ppms). The plants were sown under these conditions, and harvested during the vegetative and reproductive stages (15 days and 30 days) post germination. The results of this study titled: ‘Molecular and physiological alterations in Chickpea under elevated CO 2 concentrations’, by Paramita Palit et al in Plant and Cell Physiology 61(8):1449-1463 (2020) doi:10.1093/pcp/pcaa007, available online at https://academic.oup/pcp.

Since the whole genome sequence of the chickpea was earlier published by this group (Varshney et al, Nature Biotechnology 31,240-246, 2013 https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2491, they could identify as many as 138 metabolic pathways, mainly involved in sugar/starch metabolism, chlorophyll and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and could get to decipher the pathways that lead to how high CO 2 levels modify the growth of the chickpea plants. They found a noted increase in the root and shoot (plant height) lengths. Also the number of nodules in the roots (where nitrogen-fixing bacteria live) changed at high CO 2 levels. Note that decrease in chlorophyll synthesis hastens leaves turning yellow and plant ageing (senescence).

Different responses

Interestingly, the group found that desi chana and kabuli chana responded differently at high CO 2 levels. This needs to be explored further.

Now, given the details of the 138 metabolic pathways identified, one can look deeper into how we can use molecules or agents that can promote or inhibit specific pathways through which growth and yields can be increased, and also the type of legumes that will best suit local conditions. Now that Nobelists J. Doudna and E. Charpentier have shown us how to edit genes, perhaps the time has come to do this too on specific local legumes!

Last year researchers from IISc Bengaluru were in the news for confirming superconductivity at an ambient temperature of 13 degrees Celsius using silver and gold nanoparticles. Now physicists from the U.S. have shown superconductivity at 15 degrees Celsius. They used a high pressure device called a diamond anvil cell to compress and alter the properties. The team writes that this could revolutionise the energy grid, and change every device that’s electronically driven.

Saving the heart

How to study heart attacks? Build a heart. Researchers from Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences developed a heart-on-a-chip with special sensors for this purpose. They used the device to understand how special nanovesicles called exosomes can be used to revive the cells after a heart attack and also keep the cells functioning when they are deprived of oxygen.

If you are a photophile here is a new camera for you which can capture up to 100 billion frames per second. Called “single-shot stereo-polarimetric compressed ultrafast photography,"" or SP-CUP, it is a stereo camera with one lens. But the one lens functions as two halves that provide two views just mimicking our two eyes. A computer then runs the data from the two channels of the camera converting it into one three-dimensional movie.

Octopus inspired suckers

Ultra-thin and delicate tissue grafts have been used in recent times for wound healing. However, transferring this graft to the patients is a tedious process, taking about 30-60 minutes for a single sheet and requires skilled technicians. Inspired by the suckers in octopus, researchers have developed a small handheld device that uses hydrogel to pick up the thin sheet and transfer to the required surface in just about 10 seconds.
